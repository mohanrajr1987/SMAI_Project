Positive 4557 pI am working on an application with Visual Studio 2015 on Windows 7. The application has a C frontend, a C CLR wrapper and C native code.p  pMy application crashes with an access violation while initializing a static variable at function scope with C native code. But only on Windows Server 2003 Enterprise SP2 and not on Windows 7 or Windows Server 2012. I know Windows Server 2003 is out of support, but I have to target that platform for a few additional months and Visual Studio 2015 provides a platform toolset to target it.p  pI created a small reproducible example which you find at the end.p  pThe crash only happens with all three parts involved C, C CLR, C. If I remove any, the crash is gone.p  pThe crash only happens with a custom constructor defined. If I remove the constructor, the crash is gone.p  pI am no assembly expert, but for me it looks like the crash is caused by the code which checks if the static initialization is required. The constructor is not even called.p  pMy question is Why does it crash on Windows Server 2003 Am I missing some important project settingp  h1The error messageh1  pre classlangnone prettyprintoverridecodeUnhandled exception at 0x1000167E Native.dll in Managed.exe.dmp 0xC0000005 Access violation reading location 0x00000000. codepre  h1Visual C Console Application Managed.exeh1  h2Program.csh2  pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecode Target framework .NET Framework 4  Platform target x86  using System  namespace Managed      class Program              static void Mainstring[] args                      Console.WritePress enter to start test...

Positive 4557 pI am currently writing a set of wrappers for a native C library. The intention is to use the library with C. To do this I have a solution with three projects. One is the native C Library. The second project is the cCLI wrapper, which is set up to have the native library as a reference. The last project is a C unit test library that I intent to test the wrappers with. This setup seems to work as intended apart from having to copy the dll and pdb files for the native library manually, as visual studio refuses to add the native library as a reference for the C unit test project. I have created a minimal example demonstrating this setup here a hrefhttpsdl.dropboxusercontent.comu6399753wrapperTest.zip relnofollowhttpsdl.dropboxusercontent.comu6399753wrapperTest.zipap  pAs I said, this seemingly works fine apart from when I am debugging. I am able to step into functions just fine and the wrappers seem to behave as expected. I am however not able to inspect pointers to native objects in the wrapper for their value. It simply lists them as unable to read memory or Nativep  pI have googled quite a bit and found people saying different things. I tried enabling Allow unsafe code and enable native code debugging on the c unit test project. I also tried setting debugger type to mixed on the wrapper project. Visual Studio it self also warned me that the debugger was incompatible and suggested to enable use managed compatibility mode. Non of this seemed to have any effect. p  pstrongEditstrong A rather discussion long took place on whether or not it was even possible to step from managed to unmanaged code. Several Stackoverflow questions and answers like a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6643645howdoistepthroughamethodinanunmanageddllwhenloadedfromamanagedprrq1thisa and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions27650484usingmixedmodedebuggingonamanagedunittestinvisualstudio2013rq1thisa, as well as the provided minimal example established that is indeed possible. I would however still like an answer to the original question.p
Positive 4557 pIve been looking at an issue related to unit testing and managednative interop via CCLI. The details arent important so I wont fill them in unless asked, but the situation can be distilled as followsp  pTwo assemblies, call them Lib and Dep, exist in the same directory, call it D. Lib depends on Dep via an assembly reference. We are running in an application that lives in a different, unrelated directory. The application creates a new AppDomain with ApplicationBase set to directory D, loads the Lib assembly, and tries to construct a type in it via reflection.p  pAs part of Libs module constructor we transition into the default AppDomain and load the referenced assembly Dep. Because the default AppDomains ApplicationBase is NOT directory D, Dep cannot be resolved, a FileNotFoundException is thrown, and loading the Lib assembly fails.p  pThis all makes sense  convoluted as it may be, we tried to load an assembly thats not on the assembly resolution path for the current AppDomain, and failed.p  pBUT if I run this whole process in the default AppDomain instead of creating a new AppDomain, there is no failure. Even through directory D is not the ApplicationBase, the Lib assembly is loaded and the code instantiating one of its classes runs correctly. The module constructor code should still be run in the default AppDomain although it does not need to transition to it.p  pIt seems to me that the second case should fail just like the first one. Whats different about the assembly reference resolution process between these two casesp

Positive 4557 pI have an unmanaged class that is running a message loop for a child Win32 window.  When the program goes to close, it starts the finalizer for the managed class that holds the unmanaged reference to this class.  Because another thread is dependent on this class, I need the finalizer to wait until the message loop thread has completed a loop and exits and terminates.  However, the timeout loop I have apparently takes too long for the GC finalizer thread or the main thread terminates destroying the entire process.  p  pIs there a way to tell the GC to not timeout a thread for finalizers  I.E.

Positive 4557 pPer user request I implemented NumericUpDown with varying Increment 0.1 on arrow press, 0.01 on SHIFTarrow press as suggested in this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma6961429434378answera. It works very well when the user interacts with the mouse to press the controls arrows.p  pHowever, the keyboard input with the Up arrow does not trigger UpButton when the SHIFT is pressed same for the Down key and the DownButton. Instead, the text in the control is being selected. Since the normal behavior is for both methods to be triggered when the keyboard arrows are pressed, of course I would like to keep this functionality on for the SHIFT combination as well.p  pSo far I have tried overriding every method in the NumericUpDown which contains the Key word but none could help me. ProcessCmdKey can detect the key combination and disable the default selection behavior but it doesnt not lead to UpButtonDownButton being triggered either. p  pAny ideasp

Negative 4557 pIm working on a WPF application that sometimes exhibits odd problems and appears to emhangem in the UI.  It is inconsistent, it happens in different pages, but it happens often enough that it is a big problem.  I should mention that it is not a true hang as described below.p  pMy first thought was that the animations of some buttons was the problem since they are used on most pages, but after removing them the hangs still occur, although seemingly a bit less often.  I have tried to break into the debugger when the hang occurs however there is never any code to view. No code of mine is running.  I have also noticed that the hang is not complete.  I have code that lets me drag the form around it has no border or title which continues to work.  I also have my won close button which functions when I click it.

Negative 4557 pI have code that reads the Windows Event Log.  It uses OpenEventLog, ReadEventLog and gets the event source and event ID.  Then it looks up the source under the p  precodeHKEYLOCALMACHINESYSTEMCurrentControlSetServicesEventlogApplication codepre  pkey, loads the appropriate DLLs according to what is listed in codeEventMessageFilecode and finally uses codeFormatMessagecode to merge the event strings with the message DLL content to get the final event message text.  This is the recommended way, and although a bit of a pain, it works great.p  pUntil... I go lookup the source and find it doesnt have an codeEventMessageFilecode, but rather a codeProvideGuidcode entry.  This seems to be the new way they show up on Vista and Windows 2008.  Uggh  nothing to pass to FormatMessage for looking up the message text and merging in the data strings p  pp  pSearching the registry for the guid does lead to references to other files http.sys in the case of the HTTP source, but I can never get the complete message text.  Do I have to use those codeEvtOpenSessioncode APIs  Im hoping not since I already have the codeEVENTLOGRECORDcode from a call to codeReadEventLogcode, and the fact that the software needs to run on Windows 2003 where codeEvtOpenSessioncode isnt supported only available on Vista and Windows 2008.  NOTE Some sources on Vista have ProviderGUID, and others have EventMessageFile, so the old method is still viable.p  pSo what Im after is a way to look at the ProviderGuid and get the DLL that needs to be passed to FormatMessage for displaying the complete event log message text.p  pThanks for any inputp

Negative 4557 pHi I am trying to learn CSS and have been looking at the source of websites to learn how it works in practice.

So my question is in regard to how they have achieved a centered content box on the website whith a background that fills to expand to your browser width.p  pstrongemI have firebug installed and I cant figure out why the divs on their site eg. gutter, navigation will expand to fill the entire browser width. I dont see how these divs are calculating their width value, because it seems that none of the child elements are large enough or have a rule which would force these divs to become larger.emstrongp  pI dont understand how the width is 100, I would have expected to see some margin auto rule or width 100 specified somewhere in the CSS but I cant find it. Other websites using the 960gs may be doing the same thing but I just used this site for reference since I think it has a nice design.p  pI hope my question makes sense and thank you for any help with thisp

But in order to be able to justify the creation of any tool inhouse I need to be able to fully explain why I cannot just achieve what I want in the nant config file.  Or in any other way that does not involve creating or using a tool.  And ideally, it would be faster if I didnt have to write or use a tool anyway.p  pSo my question is, is that possiblep

Negative 4557 pAre there any tools out there for helping to debug  check the xml serialization processp  pFor instance, suppose an item is marked as internal instead of public.  There is no compile time error message, nor a runtime error message.  If you set a breakpoint and step into the serialization process, the item is just just skipped.  In other words, it is often hard to find these types of problems. A debug tool would allow you to step through the process and provide some feedback e.g. encountered this attribute, iterated through properties and didnt find a corresponding public one, skipped. Another option would be a check tool to examine all the classes with xml serialization attributes to make sure they are accessible and have set methods, etc.p

Negative 4557 pFirst off I will say I am completely new to security in coding. I am currently helping a friend develop a small game in Python which will have a login server. I dont have much knowledge regarding security, but I know many games do have issues with this. Everything from 3rd party applications bots to WPE packet manipulation. Considering how small this game will be and the limited user base, I doubt we will have serious issues, but would like to try our best to limit problems. I am not sure where to start or what methods I should use, or whats worth it. For example, sending data to the server such as login name and password. p  pI was told his information should be encrypted when sending, so incase someone was viewing it with whatever means, that they couldnt get into the account. However, if someone is able to capture the encrypted string, wouldnt this string always work since its decrypted server side In other words, someone could just capture the packet, reuse it, and still gain access to the accountp  pThe main goal I am really looking for is to make sure the players are logging into the game with the client we provide, and to make sure its secure broad, I know. I have looked around at different methods such as Public and Private Key encryption, which I am sure any hex editor could eventually find. There are many other methods that seem way over my head at the moment and leave the impression of overkill.p  pI realize nothing is 100 secure. I am just looking for any input or reading material links to accomplish the main goal stated above. Would appreciate any help, thanks.p
Negative 4557 pIm currently migrating a project that is using Spring MVC without annotations to Spring MVC with annotations. This is causing less problems than expected but I did come across one issue.p  pIn my project I have set up an access mechanisme. Whether or not a User has access to a certain view depends on more than just the role of the User e.g. it also depends on the status of the entity, the mode viewedit, .... To address this I had created an abstract parent controller which has a method emhasAccessem. This method calls also other methods like emgetAllowedEditStatusesem which are here and there overridden by the child controllers.   p  pThe emhasAccessem method gets called from the emshowFormem method below code was minimized for your readabilityp  precodeOverride protected ModelAndView showFormfinal HttpServletRequest request,                                 final HttpServletResponse response,                                 final BindException errors throws Exception      Integer id  Integer.valueOfrequest.getParameterID     Project project  this.getProjectid     if this.hasAccessproject, this.getActiveUser          return new ModelAndViewerrorNoAccess, code, project  null  project.getCode  null          return this.showFormrequest, response, project, errors  codepre  pSo, if the User has no access to the view then he gets redirected to an error page.p  pNow the pickle how to set this up when using annotations. There no longer is a showForm or other method that is always called by the framework.br My and maybe your first thought was simply call this method from within each controller before going to the view. This would of course work but I was hoping for a nicer, more generic solution less code duplication. The only other solution I could think of is preceeding the hasAccess method with the emModelAttributeem annotation but this feels a lot like raping the framework .p  pDoes anyone have a better ideap

Negative 4557 pI just recently finished reading ema hrefhttpwww.cert.orgbookssecurecoding relnofollowSecure Coding in C and Caem by Brian Seacord, who works for a hrefhttpwww.cert.org relnofollowCERTa.  p  pOverall, its an excellent book and I would recommend it to any programmer who hasnt yet read it.  After reading it, it occurs to me that for all the various types of security vulnerabilities such as exploit code injection, buffer overflows, integer overflows, string formatting vulnerabilities, etc., every single security hole seems to come down to one thing the ability to access a memory address that isnt bounded by a buffer that was legitimately allocated by the process.p  pThe ability to inject malicious code, or reroute the program logic depends entirely on being able to access memory addresses that fall emoutsideem legitimately allocated buffers.  But in a language like Java, this is simply impossible.  The worst that could happen is a program will terminate with an codeArrayIndexOutOfBoundsExceptioncode, leading to a denialofservice.  p  pSo are there any security vulnerabilities possible in safe languages like Java, where invalid memory accesses are not possible  I use Java as an example here, but really Im interested in knowing about security vulnerabilities in any language that prevents invalid memory accesses.p

Negative 4557 pOk, Im really stumped with this one. I have this Compact Framework application which calls your standard .NET web service. This has been working pretty well for a while, but recently we were asked to make this software work on another Windows CE device. p  pThis new device seems to have been manufactured in Korea, and has some weirdbuggy default configuration. Regional settings on the Control Panel show that the locale is set to EnglishUnited States and the User Interface Language and Input Language settings have this value set as well.p  pThere are some weird issues though. On Windows Explorer, the usual  characters that are used to separate folders, appear as a crossedout W. The small input panel has some characters that are also wrong, some look clearly Korean.p  pThe problem with all of this, is that for some reason I get a PlatformNotSupportedException, when calling a Web Service method that returns a DataSet. On the debugger I can see that the the CurrentUICulture is properly set to enUS, but somehow this doesnt keep the program from running into this issue. p  pI think that the Korean language installed on the device is conflicting with the culture configuration of the Web Service, but I dont have a clue about the details, and I dont know how I could fix it. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Using the Audio Queue framework, can I read the output of itunes playing in the background of the device into a AudioQueueLevelMeterState variable  Once I have that variable, I can do everything I need to do, I just cant seem to figure out how to get that information.  All the samples Ive looked at read from either audio internal to your app, or from mic input.  To keep my app as simple as possible, Id prefer to let the user setup whatever music they want in itunes and just have it playing in the background when they load my app...p  pForgive me if this question has already been answered many times, but I simply need a good lead on where to begin researching this solution.

Here is a sample code that creates a db, table, inserts data and retrieves it again. p  pExamplep  precodevar bytes[97, 0, 6, 244, 98, 66, 76, 65, 131, 5, 7, 142, 81, 184, 112, 33]  openDatabasetest, 1.0, test, 5000.transactionfunctiontx  tx.executeSqlDROP TABLE IF EXISTS MYTABLE, [], function tx.executeSqlCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS MYTABLEcontent BLOB,[],function tx.executeSqlINSERT INTO MYTABLE values, [bytes],      function              tx.executeSqlSELECT  FROM MYTABLE , [], functiontransaction, results                      console.logresults.rows.item0          ,functiontransaction, errorconsole.logerror ,functiontransaction, errorconsole.logerror   codepre  pI am  trying to store the array as is, which actually saves as a joined string 97, 0, 6, 244, 98, 66, 76, 65, 131, 5, 7, 142, 81, 184, 112, 33.

Negative 4557 pIm just getting back into Java and Ive been trying to figure out how exactly I should be organizing my project. I come from a C background where you just have to make sure that the libraries you compile are retrievable by the executable or other libraries by keeping them in the same folders or subfolders, but java seems to do things differently.p  pIn my Eclipse workspace I have my main project Im working on just one for now, more later and it references external JARs in my case, the gazillion of files of Apache Axis2.p  pWhere should I be storing these libraries that my projects depends on when building I will need to add everything to source control really soon, and so I cant keep referencing these JARs by absolute path on my machine. I read suggestions for putting this IN a subfolder of my main project, but I feel thats not ideal. I think I should be keeping them in the same sourcecontrolled parent folder as the project, and somehow reference them through relative path eclipse one does absolute path through the UI, really, so something likep  pcJavaProjectsMyProject cJavaProjectsaxis21.5.4 cJavaProjectswhatever other libraryp  pIs there an even better wayp

Negative 4557 pI know about Grid. What I dont like about Grid is that I have to specifically index every single row and col.

If I want to move a row, thats easy, I can just copy paste the xaml to the right spot, nothing else needs to get touched. A col, is a bit harder, but still can be done easily with cutpaste, just needs to be done to every row.p  pWith grid, one may need to touch every single thing in it depending on whats moved.p  pAnd what would be really cool, is if one could declare the column width and row heights up above just like a grid. But then as need, provide override values in the actual row,col declaration down below that actually contains the gui elements.p  pDoes anything like this existp

Negative 4557 pMy Node.js application accepts connections from the outside. Each connection handler reads a SET on Redis, eventually modifies the set itself, then moves on.

Negative 4557 pIm trying to code up an interface to a basic ECG device. I need the form to setup the device, send the record message and save the ECG data that comes back into a file as well as report a bit on the screen. The hardware device gets sent commands, and returns data via a serial interface.p  pMy question is about the most appropriate class structures to set up.p  pOption 1 MainWindow instantiates a  Hardware Device Object that reads the ECG info realtime, creates an ECG File class object and handles it all internally to the Device object. When recording is finished, MainWindow deletes the Device object and were done.p  pOption 2 MainWindow instantiates the Hardware Device Object that receives a whole lot of data, maintains that data as a publically accessible data structure member then MainWindow would then refer to that Device Object data structure, instantiate the ECG File class object emitselfem and write it out to a file.p  pIdeally Id like to write the data out in different formats eg. classes that specify the formatp  pSorry if the questions not that clear, I guess Im asking whether its appropriate for a hardware device object to also manage all its own data, or pass it back for the main window to then process itself.p  pIve had a go at option 1, but its getting ugly and Im not sure whether Ive misdesigned the thing from the start.p  pAnyall views appreciatedp  pPetep
Negative 4557 pI want to change a user password via a REST API. This is not a forgotten or reset password function, but a logged in user wanting to change their password.p  pThe form requires the current password, the new password, and a confirmation for the new password. However, I want to validate each form field as the user fills it out. This is trivial for codenewPasswordcode and codeconfirmNewPasswordcode client side, but not for codecurrentPasswordcode. Currently performing update to the User object via codePUT usersidcode. If a password parameter is passed, I check for the codecurrentPasswordcode parameter and ensure it is correct prior to saving. However, for validation, Im unsure of the best approach.p  pI also have a codePOST usersvalidatecode  not sure if this is best either. This validates a User object for both create and update, but only validates fields that belong to the User object codeemailcode, codeusernamecode, codepasswordcode. codecurrentPasswordcode isnt one of these. Wondering how to handle this. Some things Ive consideredp  pcodePOST userscheckpasswordcode, codePOST usersvalidatecode adding in validation for currentPassword if that parameter is passed, and check that currentPassword matches the users existing password and codePOST usersidvalidatecode separate validation for existing user, requiring codecurrentPasswordcode.p  pAny thoughts or advice would be greatly appreciated. My first application that only exposes functionality via REST API.p

Negative 4557 pSo I have a couple of questions about forkp  p1 Im pretty sure that forking allows several threads to access a shared address space, which makes it really cheap for the system. Im also pretty sure that each process is allocated stack space. Also, I dont believe that calling fork created a new process image which is created using exec, as far as I know Am I right in these assertionsp  p2 Now for an incredibly dense question is calling fork on a process tantamount to multithreading Like if you fork a parent process, do the parent and the child have their own threadp  p3 if fork replicates a parent process, how does the child know when to stop forking I.e., you have the following simple codep  precodeinclude int glob6 char buf[]a write to stdoutn main     int var    int pid    var88    printfBefore Forkn    ifpidforklt0        printffork Errorn    else ifpid0            glob        var         else        printfnPID d ,GLOB  d,VAR  dn,getpid,glob,var    exit0  codepre  psrc a hrefhttpallprogramsc.blogspot.com201001simpleforkprograminlinuxunixc.html relnofollowhttpallprogramsc.blogspot.com201001simpleforkprograminlinuxunixc.htmlap  pWhat stops the child from forking again and again and again Does the child process stop at the call to fork, and the command fork then returns the childs PID to the parentp  pOn a related note, how would you create a process whose children continue to forkp  pAny help would be greatly appreciated, and thank you very much.p
Negative 4557 pI am using the codeDataGridViewcode component to quickly and easily display readonly SQL query results to the user. I have it working as desired, but I have to wonder if Im doing things the right way. Its a complicated component after all, and I am completely new to SQL access and data binding in .NET.p  pThe MSDN help suggests using a codeBindingSourcecode object as the intermediary, so Ive come up with the following code which seems to work just finep  precodemBindingSource.DataSource  null mBindingSource.Clear  using SqlDataReader query  GetQuery    if query  null ampamp query.HasRows        mBindingSource.DataSource  query     CDataGrid.DataSource  mBindingSource     codepre  pHowever, I want to reformat some of this raw data. For example, some of the values are stored as codeintcode or codebytecode types in the underlying tables, but they actually represent various codeenumcode values. Currently I am using the following code to perform the desired transformation inspired by a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryz1cc356h28vVS.8029.aspx relnofollowthis MSDN pageap  precodeprivate void CDataGridCellFormattingobject sender, DataGridViewCellFormattingEventArgs args    DataGridViewColumn column  CDataGrid.Columns[args.ColumnIndex]   switch column.Name        case FieldNameProductID     case FieldNameVersionID       int x  args.Value as int       ProductCode code  ProductCodex  0       args.Value  code.ToString       break      case FieldNameProductType       byte y  args.Value as byte       ProductType type  ProductTypey  0       args.Value  type.ToString       break     codepre  pIs this the proper way to do things The reason I ask is because it seemed as if the codeBindingSourcecode object is designed partially to perform such types of transformations. The documentation is hard to navigate, however, and I have yet to find a good example of what Im trying to do.p

Negative 4557 pI am making a game.  Part of the game is to collect objects.  You get points for diversity so each object in category has properties.  If you have collected an object with a certain property, the multiplier for that property is no longer applied to any of the other objects with the property.  The points are calculated by combinig all the unqiue values for each property you have collected, and then multiplying by the coefficient for that property. For examplep  precodePoints Category Toys Base 2 Shape 7 Material 10 Color 5  Bouncy ball             Snow Globe category sphere         category sphere     shape round             shape round material rubber         material glass color swirls            color clear  Collected bases  myobjects.length  base  2  2  4 shapes  arrayround.length  7 materials  arrayrubber, glass  10 color  arrayswirls, red  5  score  bases  shapes  materials  color  4  7  20  10  41 codepre  pThe objects are stored as nosql documents mongodb.  My question is, what is the best way to select all the remaining objects from the database in the order of which uncollected objects will add the most points to the users score.p

Negative 4557 pI am making a server and I use fork for creating child processes but I have doubts about that. Here are somep  ol liWhy do you need to close main socket in a child process and new connection accepted socket in the parent process after accepting a new connection I thought that sockets are only integers with some id which are used to access opened sockets in some systemwide object which is only acceptable through system functions calls. In that case fork would only copy the integer but would have no affect on socket opened.li liI have checked and found out that if I fork a process inside a class method, all members are copied. Well, I have found out it is copyonedit so does it mean that my server class will be copied in each child that uses a nonconstant function How do I make some memory shared between all such processes like a list of tasks and each child puts something into it while the parent is reading stuff from it I guess fork is not the right function for that. What is the best wayli ol  pP.S. I am pretty sure I know the answer to the second question, which is clone, but just wanted to make sure thats the right function.p

Negative 4557 pI recently came back to native iOS development and am working on a Tab Bar app.  I noticed the process of building one has changed.  All the tutorials mention adding a Tab Bar controller to the mainwindow.xib of a Windowbased application.  I really do enjoy using the interface builder system to create a tab bar but this seems to be a thing of the pastp  pWithout that initial window to add the tab bar controller its kind of a mute point.  The tab bar template isnt bad, it just uses code to setup each of the views tab bar elements, etc.  This is fine, but I really did like the methodology of separating the interface and the code behind. When I work with clients its nice to show them the interface changing visually.p  pMy question is 1 Is it possible to still build a tab bar app using the tab bar controller and interface building to customize my tab bar  And 2 How do I go about doing this Are there any tutorials  Im not against building this up from scratch using the empty template.p  pThanks,p  pDavidp

This behavior is odd because like I said earlier it runs perfectly fine in a normal iOS Safari browser or when applemobilewebappcapable is missing or set to no.  I have some Safari crash logs I found but from what I understand not much I can do with those without source. p  pAny insight on why this could be happening would be greatly appreciated because I am at a loss.  Ive been searching for days trying to find someone else with the same problem with no luck.  Hopefully it is something simple I am overlooking.  Thanks.p

Negative 4557 pI am having trouble figuring out a good branching strategy that allows for easy merges and tracking of change sets in our environment.  p  pThe quick quick summary of the release management goes like thisp  pWe have several commercial products as part of a solution.  Unchangeable external factors result in our having to strongmaintain multiple versions of the software indefinitelystrong.  Releases are way too frequent and usually in response to a list of enhancements or defects and on VERY aggressive schedules.  Bugfixonly releases are usually point releases maintained in the parent release branch.  Releases with new functionality usually become a new versionbranch.p  pThe source control tree looks like thisp  precode trunk  dev    Product ABC      ABC 1.0         ABC 1.0.1 point release same branch      ABC 2.0    Product XYZ      XYZ 1.0      XYZ 2.0 codepre  pDev is obviously our development branch and is not expected to be stable.  Dev changes that pass peer review are promoted to the trunk which I like to think of as stable but still development code.  As we add new features to the trunk usually in response to a customer project we eventually get close to releasing and I branch off of the trunk into a branch like Product ABC 2.0 above.p  pThe nightmare develops when we start fixing defects in the release branch.  We want to merge them back into the trunk but it should go into the dev branch first  however since the branch was created from the trunk this isnt possible unless we do a baseless merge back to dev.  Likewise if we make changes in dev and move them into the trunk and want to merge those into a product branch again it isnt possible without a baseless merge.p  pThis just seems to be such a convoluted branching plan that Im convinced its totally wrong or that there is no good way to branch with our model and how many releases we do and maintain for years for different customers.p  pThe MS guidance even the advanced advanced plan seems to be based on simpler release scenarios.  Is there anything I am missing here that would bring some sanity backp

Negative 4557 pI have a stored procedure that needs to set a save point so that it can, under certain circumstances, undo everything it did and return an error code to the caller, or acceptcommit it and return success to the caller.  But I need it to work whether the caller has already started a transaction or not.  The doc is extremely confusing on this subject.  Here is what I think will work, but Im not certain of all the ramifications.p  pThe thing is  this SP is called by others.  So I dont know if theyve started a transaction or not...  Even if I require users to start a transaction to use my SP, I still have questions about the proper use of save points...p  pMy SP will test if a transaction is in progress, and if not, start one with BEGIN TRANSACTION.  If a transaction is already in progress, it will instead create a save point with SAVE TRANSACTION MySavePointName, and save the fact this is what I did.p  pThen if I have to roll back my changes, if I did a BEGIN TRANSACTION earlier, then I will ROLLBACK TRANSACTION.  If I did the save point, then I will ROLLBACK TRANSACTION MySavePointName.  This scenario seems to work great.p  pHere is where I get a little confused  if I want to keep the work Ive done, if I started a transaction I will execute COMMIT TRANSACTION. But if I created a save point  I tried COMMIT TRANSACTION MySavePointName, but then the caller tries to commit its transaction and gets an error The COMMIT TRANSACTION request has no corresponding BEGIN TRANSACTION.  So Im wondering then  a save point can be rolled back that works ROLLBACK TRANSACTION MySavePointName will NOT roll back the callers transaction.  But perhaps one never needs to commit it  It just stays there, in case you need to roll back to it, but goes away once the original transaction is committed or rolled backp  pIf there is a better way to nest a transaction, please shed some light as well.  I havent figured out how to nest with BEGIN TRANSACTION but only rollback or commit my internal transaction.  Seems ROLLBACK will always roll back to the top transaction, while COMMIT simply decrements trancount.p

Using a codeCGAffineTransformScalecode alone doesnt do the job, because the text in the label becomes blurry when scaled up.p  pSo what Im doing is actually using the CGAffineTransformScale to just show that its scaling up, saving the frame size, reverting the transform identity, and finalizing the frame size.

Negative 4557 pThis is an ugly one. I wish I wasnt having to ask this question, but the project is already built such that we are handling heavy loads of validations in the database. Essentially, Im trying to build a function that will take two stacks of data, weave them together with an unknown batch of operations or comparators, and produce a long string.p  pYes, that was phrased very poorly, so Im going to give an example. I have a form that can have multiple iterations of itself. For some reason, the system wants to know if the entered start date on any of these forms is equal to the entered end date on any of these forms. Unfortunately, due to the way the system is designed, everything is stored as a string, so I have to format it as a date first, before I can compare. Below is pseudo code, so please dont correct me on my syntaxp  pstrongInput datastrongp  precodelogFormValidationtodate  todate                   , formname.control1name, formname.control2name codepre  pNow, as I mentioned, there are multiple iterations of this form, and I need to loop build a fully recursive comparison note it may not always be typical boolean comparisons, it could be internally called functions as well, so .In or anything like that wont work. In the end, I need to get it into a format like below so the validation parser can read it.p  precodeORtodateformname.control1name.1  todateformname.control2name.1    ,todateformname.control1name.2  todateformname.control2name.1    ,todateformname.control1name.3  todateformname.control2name.1    ,todateformname.control1name.1  todateformname.control2name.2            ,todateformname.control1name.n  todateformname.control2name.n codepre  pYeah, its ugly...but given the way our validation parser works, I dont have much of a choice. Any input on how this might be accomplished Im hoping for something more efficient than a double recursive loop, but dont have any ideas beyond thatp  pOkay, seeing as my question is apparently terribly unclear, Im going to add some more info. I dont know what comparison I will be performing on the items, Im just trying to reformat the data into something useable for ANY given function. If I were to do this outside the database, itd look something like this.

Negative 4557 pI am using Xcode 4 with PhoneGap Cordova 1.6 and ChildBrowser.

Since we use a CMS, this isnt much of a problem  the bulk of PDFs are called from a template with data filled in from the CMS and they are fine. But there are some pages in the site where the client has added a link to an uploaded PDF into the content of the page. In this case, there is no easy way to add the above code to the inline link.p  pI figured that I can use jQuery to look at each a tag on the page when clicked and if clicked, run the ChildBroswer instance, and this would cover both types of PDF links, but I cant seem to get it to work.

Negative 4557 pI have a jqGrid with multi select set to true using the asp.net jqGrid.  I want it to select multipole rows then click a button and something will apply to the IDs for all those rows.

The problem is Ive used the rowselect method and although that allows me to populate the form on row select it does not allow me to select multiple checkbox rows. p  pIs there a way to make the checkboxes not activate the rowselect method  OR is the alternative to create a hyperlink on the result of the value in a cell that calls a method in code behind passing the ID Is my last idea even possible Thanks p

Negative 4557 pI have been working on a customization around UDP to make it reliable. I have this design problem which I realized only after my entire program was ready and I started sending packets from source to sink.p  pScenario I created a single thread for reception of packets. The parent does packet sending job. Since this is just a POC, I have kept the buffer and common data structures as global pointer for whom memory is allocated on heap by the parent. I am taking care of critical memory sections using mutex.p  pAs part of reliability I send across some control packets apart from data packets. At anytime, client will send data packets and receive control packets from server whereas server will receive data packets and send out control packets. I have used single socket, as my understanding is send amp recv works simultaneously on single socket and default blocking.p  pProblem For test purpose, I send 100 packets from source to sink. Unfortunately, the thread on the server side busy keeps receiving packets and stores it in buffer. Server code isnt delivering packets to application until the parent thread gets the context switch. This add to unacceptable delay in overall communication.p  pPlease help me understand, what is the issue what can be changed to improve the performancep  pThanks in advance, Kedarp

Negative 4557 pIm currently working on a project where we have a Java web app bought from a 3rd party vendor thats connecting to SQL Server using Microsofts JDBC driver. However, Ive been given the requirement of having to encrypt the connection string using a proprietary encryption protocol. p  pSo my question is how feasible would it be to extend the JDBC drivers distributed from Microsoft to incorporate this encryption. At this point Im mainly thinking of creating a JDBC wrapper that will underneath use the Microsoft JDBC driver. p  pIm open to other suggestions from more experienced people who might have done something similar in the past, or even if they could share pitfalls with this approach.p

Negative 4557 pstrongUPDATEstrong Since writing this question, I have come across this a hrefhttpconnect.microsoft.comVisualStudiofeedbackdetails617491duringsecuritynegotiationiftheclientgoesawaywcfserviceisterminatedtimingdependentdetails relnofollowBug Reporta which provides a method of replicating the symptoms of the bug I am seeing consistently.p  pI cannot, yet, confirm if this is the cause of the bug I am experiencing, but it warrants some investigation. I have not come across a workaround for the bug described in the report yet.p  pTo summarise the report If the WCF client closes during authentication at the WCF service then an asynchronous exception is thrown at the service, which in my case is not caught until it reaches the program.cs file and so makes it difficult to handle gracefully.p  pstrongOriginal Questionstrongp  pI have a WCF Service hosted within a Windows Service.p  pThe WCF service allows clients to subscribe providing a callback, after which, the service publishes updates to all subscribers.p  pThe service maintains a codeDictionaryltint, ICallbackgtcode of all current subscribers callback interfaces.p  pWhen an event occurs requiring information to be published, the service loops through the collection and calls the appropriate method defined in ICallback.p  pThis all works fine and all occasions where the ICallback objects are used are wrapped in a try catch in case of object disposed exceptions and any other exceptions which might occur.p  pThe problem I am having is that a Communication Exception is being raised at the Servicep  blockquote   pSystem.ServiceModel.CommunicationException p      pThe socket connection was aborted.

Negative 4557 pIve got the following setup in Windows Azurep  ul liA test hosted service connected to its own test database.li liA production hosted service connected to its own production database.li ul  pWhen a build has been verified on test and is ready to go to production, we spin up a staging deployment in the production hosted service, and do a quick smoke test to make sure the new build is not totally broken.  The staging instance is deployed with the exact bits that will be deployed to production, so its talking to the production database.  When staging is blessed, we hit the VIP Swap button, and the build is live on production.  All is good.p  pThe problem comes about when the database model changes.  Ive got Code First Migrations working perfectly.  I can add new migrations, apply them locally with the package manager console, and then generate SQL scripts to upgrade the test database when I push a new build to test.  The question is, whats the best practice on using Code First Migrations along with stagingproduction deployments  When I deploy a new build to staging with model changes, it expects to find a database that matches its model.  But then if I apply the model changes to the production database, the production instance complains because its model doesnt match.p  pIve just been skipping the staging smoke test.  I upload to staging, then update the production database and hit the VIP Swap button pretty much at the same time.  Then smoke test on production.  If something is majorly broken, Swap VIP back and revert the database changes.p  pIs there a better way to do this, or is that pretty much itp  pThanksp

Which makes perfect sense and exactly what I expected it to do but I did not realise that it could build up so horribly and cause a performance problem for games. If I could get rid of this problem then it would really make my game run like lightning no matter what phone it was on. So my question is what would you do to make it so that all of these temporary iterators were not created and then immediately discarded resulting in nasty GC runs Bonus points for doing so in a way that does not make my code completely ugly And using ndk on Android is not an optionp  pP.S. I was thinking that for all of my ArrayLists I could start using the getint i function as they are arrays behind the scenes and the integer I would use to index that would be placed on the stack and not the heap. But for the other objects like a HashMap and LinkedList I am not sure what to do.p

Negative 4557 papologies if this a naive question. I have written a universal C Web service client it works by examining the WSDL of any Web service, and generating a Windows Forms UI that allows you to submit requests to the Web service and display responses.p  pIt generates the UI as follows first, it dynamically generates a compiled assembly using ServiceDescriptionImporter and CodeCompiler from the Web services WSDL, and then it introspects on the SoapHttpClientProtocol client generated by this process.p  pFor each Web service method, the UI to display the input parameter fields is generated by reflecting on the parameter types. Essentially, I have to recognize each type and decide how best to display it so a String parameter is displayed as a textbox, a Boolean as a checkbox, and so on.p  pThe types Im having difficulty recognizing are types such as ArrayOfKeyValuestringstringKeyValueOfstringstring. I could simply parse the name of types  along the lines of if name begins with ArrayOf, but Im sure there must be a better way to recognize these types as being arrays in some way.p  pIf anyone can suggest how to do this, Id be most grateful Thanks, Martinp

Negative 4557 pI have a list of items, all having an id and a value. I print this list in a php view script using divs, like thisp  precodeltdiv classmyListgt     ltdiv classlistItem item3 value4gtitem labelltdivgt     ltdiv classlistItem item5 value7gtitem labelltdivgt     ... ltdivgt codepre  pThe idea is to include some jQuery to attach some edit functionality to the list items. To manipulate each item I need the item ID and value ID in jQuery, which I now determine by looking for the class patterns itemID and valueID and extracting the ID part which is of course a number for each item. These IDs I then use to do an ajax call to update the right item from the list giving it a new value ID the user can pickp  pMy question the way Im doing this works, but doesnt seem too elegant to me. The jQuery .data method doesnt seem to help here, the data needs to be printed by a php view script before jQuery comes into play so the data needs to be present in the html structure and read by jQuery afterwards. I thought of custom html attributesp  precodeltdiv classlistItem itemID4 valueID7gtlabeltextltdivgt codepre  pBut is this good practice Is there a better way to feed data to jQuery How is this usually donep

Negative 4557 pWe are contemplating using Erlang for our new project that involves some amount of rich web application and datatext analytic at the backed.

But wanted to check if there anything other than coffeescript that is nearer to Erlang stylesyntax. Of course, we understand that a large part of the core erlang functionality will not be be available in the browser my question was more from the language structure point of view. Maybe, the fact that JS also supports OO and Erlang is FP might be an hindrance to expressing JavaScript constructs in Erlang.pli lipAre there any opensource tools for machine learning in Erlang Similar to Weka Java or R for machine learning and Gate Java, NLTK Python for text miningpli ol  pThanks in advance,p

Negative 4557 pI am developing an iDevice game and I would like to store the local players scores on the device. However, the local player may change. For example, if a family shares an iPad, then they may sign in to GameCenter separately before playing the game. To solve this problem, I decided to store the local scores as a dictionary where the keys are determined by the local player and the values are arrays of GKScore objects.p  pMy first idea was to use the GKLocalPlayer shared instance as the key, but since it doesnt conform to NSCopying, GKLocalPlayer is not an ideal key candidate. My second idea was to use the local players identifier, but Apple states Do not make assumptions about the contents of the player identifier string. Its format and length are subject to change. Naturally, I am concerned that a player might lose their local scores if their player identifier magically changes one day.p  pMy final idea was to use the local players alias. I have confirmed that the alias string for an unauthenticated local player is equal to codenilcode. Is it safe to use code[NSNull null]code as a dictionary key in this case Is it safe to assume the local players alias will remain consistentp

Negative 4557 pI Want to use codeRuntime Loadable Procedurescode in .Net micro framework on a USBizi chip of a Fez Panda II board. RLP is used to execute C or assembly code from en elf file for example during runtime in managed code. Useful for CPU intensive or time critical operations.p  pI have some experience with PIC32 and Atmega chips, so I have some experience with native code of chips. Managed code is great, and I believe it is a powerful feature to have it mixed with native code to use the full potential of the chip itself, like DMA or ISR. So I definetly want to use the RLP.p  pNow I have found these resources a hrefhttpwww.ghielectronics.comdownloadsNETMFLibrary20Documentation20v4.1htmlf608e39865738adc5d59b904dfa3fcee.htm relnofollowhttpwww.ghielectronics.comdownloadsNETMFLibrary20Documentation20v4.1htmlf608e39865738adc5d59b904dfa3fcee.htmap  pExamples are only available for the EMX platform of GHI another microcontrollerboardplatoform of somekind made by GHI, Fez Panda II is a product of GHI. So it isnt as easy as following the examples given, as Fez Panda II is running on USBizi, not on EMX. The user manual of Fez Panda II says it is possible to use RLP.p  pI understand that I have to set the address and size for RLP, depending on the platform in the RLP.h file. I have found these settings for the USBizi platform codeRLP Address 0x40000440. RLP Size 0x000027FC.code So far so good.p  pNow I run into the following codeUSBizi by default, RLP is not enabled and locked.code A few lines further, the documentation says codeTo enable RLP call RLP.Enablecode. Thats one down, one to go. p  pNow how to unlock RLPp  pExample code for USBizi is giving, see belowp  precodepublic static void Main       Program start up on USBizi       Unlock RLP if needed       Load ELF file first because it might be large     byte[] elffile  Resources.GetBytesResources.BinaryResources.RLPtest     RLP.LoadELFelffile      now load all RLP.Procedures      ......       dispose of the elf file to reclaim memory     elffile  null     Debug.GCtrue       start the application      ... codepre  pNow where is the method to code Unlock RLP if neededcode  That is where I am stuck.p  pIn managed code I can use the interrupt on rising edge  3.6kHz. For a user pushing a button, a response lt 1 ms is great. But for counting a frequency  50kHz it is much too slow. Ok, I could use a 7bit digital frequency divider flip flop IC, but that reduces the resolution.p  pAny hints on how to implement RLP on USBizip

What does it mean If I get rid of the singleton, the message goes away.

If I try it from the base class or from the inheriting singleton, it doesnt work. binding just ignores the new values. If I do this manually while handing the command, it works. Yes, its just an extra line of code, but I wonder, is there a way to make it work without cheating like thisp
Negative 4557 pId like to ask for some advice regarding the following problem. Im currently working on a camera app for android and i am stuck. I used the official android development site for guidance, and the program is working fine except when i click the capture button for the first time the preview freezes and stays like that. Now, this is not causing the app to stop, because after the freezing i can still click the button and it takes the picture. I know this because if i check the save location the taken pictures are there.p  pSo to summarize this mess, Id like my program to show the preview continuously even after taking a picture.

I get around 1200 fps when looking so close at a grid that every pixel ends up in the same close grid item.p  pAlthough I understand that doing this loop for every pixel is some work, it still is some easy basic math, especially now that I have removed the texturelookup and have just used a simple test, so I dont understand why this has to slow everything down so hard. My GPU has 16 cores and runs at 700Mhz. I am rendering at 960x540, 518400 pixels. It should be able to handle much more than this I would think.p  pIf I remove the antialiasing part of the above the part of code where I will test some extra adjacent points based on the increaser value, it is a little better 100fps, but come on, with these calculations, it shouldnt make much difference If I split the code so that increaser is not used but the below code is done for every different part, the framerate stays the same. If I change some ints to floats, nothing changes.p  pI have done much more intensive andor complicated shaders before, so why is this one so terribly slow Can anyone tell what calculation I do makes it go so slowp  pI am not setting uniforms that are not used or something like that, the Ccode is also doing nothing more than just rendering. It is code I have used successfully 100s of times before.p  pAnyonep

Negative 4557 pOn a very large project that I am running, our development team is using Informatica Power Center to access data in a DB2 database on an AS400 iSeries. We can establish the ODBC connection and can read the data but it is coming in EBCDIC and staying that way, never converting to ASCII. We have checked the Code Pages on the box, the driver, the parameters on the download  everything we can think of  but neither Informatica nor IBM can figure out what is going on.p  pDoes anyone have any ideas Have you done this successfully before Im wondering if we have a Linux environment issue, because when the developers use Windows drivers on a Windows box it works fine.

Id like write accesses to certain types of files to be trapped by the filter.  I then want the user to receive a dialog box, in which they can either allow the access or deny it.p  pPerhaps obviously...the kernelmode code cannot display the UI.  It will have to signal some user mode process, which will after an arbitrarily latent period of time signal back the users wish to the driver.  Ive looked a bit over a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowshardwaregg487414.aspx relnofollow UserMode Interactions Guidelines for KernelMode Driversa heres a hrefhttpwebcache.googleusercontent.comsearchqcache3aoh4AQmyWqEJ3adownload.microsoft.comdownloadebaeba1050fa31d436b928192cdfeae4b45KMUMGuide.docwindowskernelmodenotifications relnofollowGoogles Cache as HTMLa, instead of .DOCp  pI dont know what the best way to attack this is.  The only example Ive yet found to study is SysInternals FileMon.  The driver it installs gathers data in a buffer, which is periodically requested by the .EXE according to a WMTIMER loopp  precode Have driver fill Stats buffer with information if   DeviceIoControl SysHandle, IOCTLFILEMONGETSTATS,             NULL, 0, ampStats, sizeof Stats,             ampStatsLen, NULL        Abort hWnd, TCouldnt access device driver, GetLastError      return TRUE  codepre  pShould I use a similar technique  Perhaps the filter driver, upon receiving a request it wants to check, could place a record to track the request in a buffer that would contain two HEVENTs.  It would then WaitForMultipleObjects on these two HEVENTs, which represent a signaled YES or NO from user mode on whether to allow access.p  pPeriodically the monitor process running in user mode will poll the driver from another thread using a custom IOCTL.  The filter driver would return the request information... as well as the two HEVENTs that request is waiting on.  The monitor would wait for the users feedback, and when available signal the appropriate event.p  pI could also invert this model.  The user mode code could use a custom IOCTL to pass in data... such as HEVENTs which could be signaled by the driver, and just implement some kind of safe protocol.  This would eliminate the need for polling.p  pBasically just looking for guidance on method, or a working example on the web  Id also be interested to know what the mechanics would be on an asynchronous file access.  I assume theres a way so a client making an async call that is being checked could keep running and only be held up when they waited on the request to finish...p  hr  pemNote Along the way of getting the filters built and debugged, I learned there are some more modern techniques via miniFilterswhich are part of something called the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowshardwareff53889628vvs.8529.aspx relnofollowFilter Manager Modela.

Negative 4557 pI was solving some example questions from an old programming contest. In this question we get an input of how many bartender we have, and which recipes they know. Each cocktail takes 1 minute to make and we need to calculate if the order can be finished within 5 minutes, using all bartenders.p  pThe key to solving this problem is assigning cocktails as efficient as possible. And thats where Im stuck, my current algorithm gives the order to the bartender who knows the least other recipes. But of course this isnt 100 correct yet. Could anyone point me in the right direction or give me an algorithm name to google which solves this bartender problemp

I.e. if I send a message to push over APEServer, p  ol lidoes APEServer responses immediately to the application, and after that it pushes the messages to the clients asynchronously  ORli lidoes APEServer responses to the application after it has pushed the messages to the clients synchronouslyli ol  pI am asking this, because sometimes responses from APEServer to the application last to long sometimes over 1 minute. p  pThanks in advance.p
Negative 4557 pI currently have a Segment route looking like this codeshopshopIdcode where codeshopIdcode has no default value.p  pWhenever the route is matched a code in Module.php is triggered, that would do some preparation according to the codeshopIdcode and save it in the session for example.p  pMy question is, if it is possible, at that point, to set the default value for the route to that codeshopIdcode The final goal is to be able to assemble URLs without specifying the codeshopIdcode each time from this moment on.p  pI remember in ZF1 this behavior was by default, where matched params from the Request were reused when assembling the URL and you had to explicitly specify you wanted them removed. Now I need the same functionality, but configured on a codeModule.phpcode level, rather than having to rewrite every single codeassemblecode call.p

Would that be the correct way to go down p  pstrongIs there a specific way in which I can achieve the elements to be centered and in that formation no matter on the screen resolutionstrongp  h2HTMLh2  precodeltDOCTYPE htmlgt lthtmlgt     ltheadgt         lttitlegtDaniel Hopkins Personal Websitelttitlegt         ltlink relstylesheet typetextcss hrefstyle.css gt     ltheadgt      ltbodygt         ltdiv classhrtopgtampnbspltdivgt         ltdiv classhrgtampnbspltdivgt         ltdiv classhrbotgtampnbspltdivgt         ltcentergt             ltdiv classlogogt                 ltimg srclogo.pnggt             ltdivgt             ltdiv classlogonamegt                 ltimg srclogoname2.pnggt             ltdivgt             ltdiv classentergtltbgtlta hrefhome.htmlgtEnterltagtltbgt             ltdivgt     ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  h2CSSh2  precodebody  .hr      width2px     height350px     backgroundcolor000000     positionabsolute     top140px     left884px     z index10     background webkitlineargradientwhite, black, white  .logo      positionabsolute     top200px     left640px     zindex10  .logoname      positionabsolute     top260px     left900px     zindex10  .hrtop      width600px     height2px     positionabsolute     top180px     left640px     zindex10     background webkitlineargradientleft, white, black, white  .hrbot      width600px     height2px     backgroundcolor000000     positionabsolute     top442px     left640px     zindex10     background webkitlineargradientleft, white, black, white  .enter      positionabsolute     top400px     left910px     zindex10     fontsize22px     fontvariantsmallcaps     fontstylebold     fontfamilyHelvetica     colorblack  alink      textdecorationnone     color000000   unvisited link   avisited      textdecorationnone     color000000   visited link   ahover      textdecorationunderline     color000000   mouse over link   aactive      textdecorationunderline     color000000   selected link  codepre

Negative 4557 pIm try to use the Flyway db configuration management tool with MySQL databases that are only accessible via an ssh tunnel.   I cant seem to find any mention on how to do this in the Flyway docs...not sure if that is because it is utterly obvious, or because it cant be done BTW, at the moment Im trying to do this with the flyway maven plugin since most of our CI environment revolves around maven.p  pFWIW, if I manually set up an ssh tunnel, I can do the rest of the Flyway migration in maven...so maybe the question is how to have maven set up an ssh tunnel on its own.   There seems to be that capability for deployments, but Ive been unable to discover how to do it for a general case.   Heck, Im not all that wedded to maven  if this would be a slamdunk in some other tool say, gradle, then Im willing to go down that road.p  pAny ideasp

Ive even given gcc the S switch to see how they do it.  They do the format string with 13 .string statements, many of them blank strings and each character on a separate .string. I read that you can essentially make a regular string a wide string in nasm by placing the string in a dw rather than a db.  So of course I tried with .int for gas, but that doesnt work out so well.  By that I mean it prints out extra gray question marks. here is my current codep  precode.section .data locale   .string  printformat   .int ,l,c printwide   .int 0x307E,0 .section .text .global start start movq    locale,rsi movq    6,rdi call    setlocale movq    printformat,rdi movq    printwide,rsi movq    0,rax call    wprintf movq    2,rdi call    exit codepre  pThis results in 5 grayed out question marks then the hiragana  ma.  You would think that after ,l,c  there should be a ,0, but that doesnt workonly question marks are outputted after doing that. The only way I have been able to just print out the hiragana ma and no question marks is by skipping the format string and just loading printwide into rdi.p  pAgain, this is for educational purposes at the moment. So basically, how do you do the format string in both atampt syntax and intel  In c you simply put an L in front of it.  and yes I suppose you could change the lc into hex, but I dont want to do it like that p  pstrongEDITstrong  this works I changed printwide to printwide and changed printformat to .strings like the gcc S listing did.  But why does it work and is there a better way to write out the format other than using so many .string statements  and how would you do it in intel syntaxp  precode.section .data locale     .string  printformat     .string      .string      .string      .string l     .string      .string      .string c     .string      .string      .string      .string      .string      .string  printwide     .word 0x307E .section .text .global start start movq    locale,rsi movq    6,rdi call    setlocale movq    printformat,rdi movq    printwide,rsi movq    0,rax call    wprintf movq    2,rdi call    exit codepre

While all my crash reports contain only bytes which give me zero information where and what is wrong.p  precodeException Type  EXCCRASH SIGABRT Exception Codes 0x0000000000000000, 0x0000000000000000 Crashed Thread  0  Last Exception Backtrace 0   CoreFoundation                     0x3231b3e2 exceptionPreprocess  158 1   libobjc.A.dylib                    0x3a01695e objcexceptionthrow  26 2   CoreFoundation                     0x32266ef4 [NSArrayM objectAtIndex]  160 3   kodinisRaktas                      0x000b939a 0x0009f000  107418 4   kodinisRaktas                      0x000b9282 0x0009f000  107138 5   kodinisRaktas                      0x000a2434 0x0009f000  13364 6   UIKit                              0x34149574 [UIViewController loadViewIfRequired]  360 7   UIKit                              0x3419e1f2 [UIViewController contentScrollView]  22 8   UIKit                              0x3419e138 [UINavigationController computeAndApplyScrollContentInsetDeltaForViewController]  24 9   UIKit                              0x3419e01c [UINavigationController layoutViewController]  28 10  UIKit                              0x3419df48 [UINavigationController updateScrollViewFromViewControllertoViewController]  268 11  UIKit                              0x3419d694 [UINavigationController startTransitionfromViewControllertoViewController]  60 12  UIKit                              0x3419d57c [UINavigationController startDeferredTransitionIfNeeded]  320 13  UIKit                              0x3416e55c [UILayoutContainerView layoutSubviews]  176 14  UIKit                              0x3412d8c2 [UIViewCALayerDelegate layoutSublayersOfLayer]  254 15  QuartzCore                         0x33ed950e [CALayer layoutSublayers]  210 16  QuartzCore                         0x33ed90b0 CALayerlayoutifneededCATransaction  456 17  QuartzCore                         0x33f07eca [CALayer layoutIfNeeded]  138 18  UIKit                              0x341d70dc [UIViewController windowsetupWithInterfaceOrientation]  204 19  UIKit                              0x341d62c6 [UIWindow setRotatableClienttoOrientationupdateStatusBardurationforceisRotating]  3598 20  UIKit                              0x341d54aa [UIWindow setRotatableClienttoOrientationupdateStatusBardurationforce]  42 21  UIKit                              0x341d5434 [UIWindow setRotatableViewOrientationdurationforce]  64 22  UIKit                              0x3430acb4 57[UIWindow updateToInterfaceOrientationdurationforce]blockinvoke0  100 23  UIKit                              0x3419367e [UIWindow updateToInterfaceOrientationdurationforce]  214 24  UIKit                              0x341933c2 [UIWindow setAutorotatesforceUpdateInterfaceOrientation]  690 25  UIKit                              0x34192d2a [UIViewController tryBecomeRootViewControllerInWindow]  150 26  UIKit                              0x34189e86 [UIWindow addRootViewControllerViewIfPossible]  366 27  UIKit                              0x341d4ef2 [UIWindow setRootViewController]  658 28  kodinisRaktas                      0x000a1bd4 0x0009f000  11220 29  kodinisRaktas                      0x000a18f6 0x0009f000  10486 30  UIKit                              0x3418aa9c [UIApplication handleDelegateCallbacksWithOptionsisSuspendedrestoreState]  248 31  UIKit                              0x3418a620 [UIApplication callInitializationDelegatesForURLpayloadsuspended]  1164 32  UIKit                              0x3418282e [UIApplication runWithURLpayloadlaunchOrientationstatusBarStylestatusBarHidden]  694 33  UIKit                              0x3412ad1a [UIApplication handleEventwithNewEvent]  1006 34  UIKit                              0x3412a7a8 [UIApplication sendEvent]  68 35  UIKit                              0x3412a1ea UIApplicationHandleEvent  6194 36  GraphicsServices                   0x35e425f2 PurpleEventCallback  586 37  GraphicsServices                   0x35e42222 PurpleEventCallback  30 38  CoreFoundation                     0x322f03e2 CFRUNLOOPISCALLINGOUTTOASOURCE1PERFORMFUNCTION  30 39  CoreFoundation                     0x322f0386 CFRunLoopDoSource1  134 40  CoreFoundation                     0x322ef20a CFRunLoopRun  1378 41  CoreFoundation                     0x32262238 CFRunLoopRunSpecific  352 42  CoreFoundation                     0x322620c4 CFRunLoopRunInMode  100 43  UIKit                              0x34181468 [UIApplication run]  664 44  UIKit                              0x3417e2b4 UIApplicationMain  1116 45  kodinisRaktas                      0x000a0d96 0x0009f000  7574 46  kodinisRaktas                      0x000a0d4c 0x0009f000  7500 codepre  pI cant reproduce the crash on my own device, so this is all I got to determine the crash source.

Negative 4557 pI have a 2 dimensional maze that I draw onto a canvas. A red dot on the maze is displayed to show the user their position in the maze as they navigate their way around.

Negative 4557 pIve been having trouble solving this problem for days, and wasnt able to find any useful resource on this on the internet, so Ill share my findings on this matter for future referencep  pThe Python 2.7 codexmlrpclibcode client has the types defined by the XMLRPC standard builtin, plus a few common extensions. Other XMLRPCservers, such as Apache, will however sometimes use their own types, or put extensions in special namespaces, etc.p  pFor example, when you send an 8 byte integer with Apache which is not covered by the XMLRPC standard, it will send the following responsep  precodeltmethodResponse xmlnsexhttpws.apache.orgxmlrpcnamespacesextensionsgt     ltparamsgt         ltparamgt             ltvaluegt                 ltexi8gt123456789ltexi8gt             ltvaluegt         ltparamgt     ltparamsgt ltmethodResponsegt codepre  pIf you naively try to handle these types with Python you will get an empty tuple result.

Because of this when I locked up that method so it didnt return early, I also locked up my connection so it never reached its completion callback.   p  pHow can I effectively pause my go method long enough for my connection to finish so I can return the data to anywhere in my app. p  pTheres a chance Im going about this the completely wrong way so please let me know if that is the case. It does need to work kind of like this though because multiple requests will be going out at the same time and Id like different instances of this connection class to be able to control them all. p

Negative 4557 pWhen building the app I added the valid architectures architecture as armv6, armv7, armvs7 and architectures as standard architecture armv7 and armv7s. Also switched the build active architecture only to NO. Adhoc installation hangs with the status installing message attached screenshot. I have added the UDIDs properly and was successfully able to push builds like this to those devices prior to iOS 7. This is reproducible with 4 devices so I believe this is something to do with the way I am building this. All the phones uses latest iOS 7.0.2.

Negative 4557 ptheres a data set with around 6 millions of records. Each record has the same number of fields. There are 8 fields totallyp  precodeID  Title  Color  Date1  Date2  Date3  Date4... codepre  pThere should be a way to filter these records by title and all date fields or, columns in RDBMS terms.p  pThe size of the data is not so huge, around few gigabytes. We dont have long text fields etc. we got rid of them during architecture creation, so now we have only really important fields in the data set.p  pThe backend reads amp writes the data quite intensive. We would really like to speed up both readswrites and filtering by fields as much as possible. Currently were using Postgres and we like its reliability, but it seems its not really fast. Yes, we did some tweaking and optimization, added indexes, installed it on 32GB RAM machine and set all necessary settings. In other words, it works, but I still believe it might be better. What we need is speed filtering records by dates and titles should be fast, really fast. Data insertion might be slower. The backend filters all records that were not processed, process it, and sets the date flag of the datetime when it was processed. There are around 50 backend workers executed every 510 seconds, so the DB should be able to perform really fast. Also we do some DB iterations kind of a mapreduce jobs, so the DB solution should be able to execute this kind of tasks RDBMS are not really good here.p  pWe dont have joins there, the data is already optimized for big data solutions. Only one big table.p  pAnd we would like to run it on a single node, or on many small instances. The data is not really important. But we would like to avoid expensive solutions so were looking for a SQL or NoSQL solution that will perform faster than Postgres on the same cheap hardware.p  pI remember I tried MongoDB about a year or two ago. From what I remember, filtering was not so quick that moment. Cassandra was better but I remember it was able to perform only small subset of filtering queries. Riak is good but only for a big cluster with many machines. This is my very basic experience, if you guys know that one of these solutions performs great please do write that. Or suggest another solution.p  pThanksp

Negative 4557 pso I was writing a program where I need to generate a set of random numbers from 1 to a certain number that the user enters.  Then identify the approximate probability that each number from 1 to N was hit, by the random numbers generated. So for my codep  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt include ltstdlib.hgt include lttime.hgt  int mainvoid  printfEnter a number int input scanfd,ampinput getRandomIntFrom0ToKinput return 0   void getRandomIntFrom0ToK int K  int i int j int a[2][K1] int b[999][999]  int counter0  srandtimeNULL  for i0iltKi Here I am storing the random numbers and indexes of each number      a[0][i]  i    a[1][i]randK    fori0iltKiIn another array transferring the indexes from the first array      b[0][i]a[0][i]  fori0iltKiSetting the second column of array b to 0      b[1][i]0     fori0iltKiRunning two for loops to check in array a if any of the values from the index are equal to any of the random numbers in the second column      forj0jltKj               ifa[0][i]a[1][j]If they are then make the index of array b corresponding to the number equal to 01, I will eventually add a certain probability but for now I just want to see that it works                      b[1][i]b[1][i]1                Up till here if I run the program, it works  fori0iltKi      printfdn,b[0][i]    codepre  pSo the problem is that when include a printf statement for the b array, the program does not work.  I know that my code is very inefficient, but I just want to know what I am doing wrong.  Eventually what I want to do is print out both columns of the b array so that it outputs the number and corresponding percentage which i will do using 1K100 on to the screen.  Thanks, any sort of help would be greatly appreciated. p

Negative 4557 pIve been working on making my game engine, and Ive been having A LOT of trouble dealing with rotating a sprite relative to a container. its used to overlay multiple sprites and be able to easily change their location relative to the center of the object. I need to be able to rotate the object and keep their relative location proper.p  pIve got it pretty much working. I can rotate the sprite, and all the sprites relative locations stay the same. I can even do this while moving the sprite it will move AND rotate at the same time. Unless the sprite starts moving again while the sprite is turning. When this happens, the sprite continues to keep its orientation relative to the container, but will jump back to its original XY location relative to the container.p  pI stripped down my code to provide a stand alone example program, and the bug persists.

Negative 4557 pI have a webserver written in Node.JS using express, using a bunch of route commands. Everything is working fine, when running Node from the command line, but when running from within the Enide environment, for every request, I get an error message saying that an Illegal Json is received and the body is empty. This is before the route function is actually called, so I could not even examine the request header. Ive removed the express logic and declared a basic http server that simply prints the request header. The body field was missing from this header. Has anyone run into a similar problem with the Enide environmentp

Negative 4557 pI am trying to build a procedure in my Access project that will accept either a table or a form as part of the argument. If the object is a table then it should check the tables fields if its a form then it should it the forms controls.p  pIve tried using either variant or object variable types for the argument. But either way when I check the VarType the passed variable is of type object, so I cant distinguish between them.

Negative 4557 pI am using a hrefhttpwww.amcharts.com relnofollowamcharta not stock chart to generate charts of two or more datasets.

Negative 4557 pIm trying to learn about databases and SQL, and this is an issue Im having trouble with how do I detect if a new entry is a duplicate, and if it is, not emdiscardem the new entry, but merge it with the old onep  pAn example makes it clearer. Lets say that Im making a database of my video game collection.  My columns are Title varchar and then a boolean column for each platform I own the game on, since some games are on multiple platforms.p  pI buy World of Goo, and go to my database to sayp  precodeINSERT INTO collections.games Title,Windows VALUES World of Goo,1 codepre  pEasy. But six months later, I buy it again on Android, because I really like that game and want to play it in bed. What I want to do now is write a query that saysp  precodeIF select  from games where title  World of Goo      UPDATE games     SET Android  1     WHERE title  World of Goo  ELSE          INSERT INTO collections.games Title,Android VALUES World of Goo,1   codepre  pI know the first line is wrong, Id need to write if query returns 1 or more results, but ignore that for now.p  pNow... I know I could do this with a PHP script. But I dont want to use a more complex solution than is necessary  is there a way do this in SQL alonep  pAnd this is an example of a problem, I know that in reality Id remember that I owned a game and just write the query to update it.p

Negative 4557 prather a newbie at SQL, so please be gentle....as I think this is a basic one. p  pIm trying to write a query with multiple 13 counts, based off Column1. The 1st Count is the overall total. And then the 12 others are filtered by Color. I can get my results by doing multiple Counts all in one query, but this gives me 13 rows of data. The goal here is to get everything on just one row. So, almost like each count would be its own column. Here is an example of the data modelp  precodeDatabase  CARS, Table  TYPES, Column1  LICENSE, Column2  COLOR codepre  hr  precodeSELECT COUNT LICENSE AS Total ALL Cars FROM CARS.TYPES WITH NOLOCK  SELECT COUNT LICENSE AS Total RED Cars FROM CARS.TYPES WITH NOLOCK WHERE COLOR  RED codepre  pAnd on amp on amp on for each remaining color.

Negative 4557 pEDIT Right so the first part of my question has been solved with this nice little piece of code I found online, It has been modified to suit and works a treat,  The problem Im having now is making and reading the list thats created, I thought I had made  the list by using lst  [lst] as can be seen at the bottom of the code bellow. When I run the code bellow it reads the text from the file that is created in the main program and removes everything between [and] and prints it back to me, then I get this output... [47.660674766635005]p  p[48.957947570933946]p  p[49.249363925522836]p  p[37.88412609655603]p  pPerfect, except it seems that all 4 strings are made into 1 list and it wont let me choose individual indexes, Ive tried using printlst[0] which returns the list above but if I change it to lst[1] I get index out of range. Is it possible to break the list down even further Tried all sorts of configurations with indexes for lists, been through the man pages and Ive tried all of that, Must be close Tried making a list of lists but still having the same problems.p  pSo it would seem to me the obvious answer would be to look to the point where the string has been found in the text file then add it to a list straight away before searching, Tried a few things like create a new list and have the code that searches then append to the list but no, Still problems.p  pTried for x in lst and added an x to the start of each string, Then Create a list. This option I think might be the best because to work out the average of all the mpgs, I will need to know how many indexes there are in the list to divide the numbers by. Ill just get it to count the Xs Theres probably an easier way but Im not sure. Just been reading the json manpage that was linked bellow and that seems like a good option.

It might not be the neatest code but Im learning,p  pIn the def writeToFile function I have cast the mpg into a list just before it is written to the file, the program doesnt actually use the list, Thats just there because I thought it might make it easier to extract the data between [ and ] from the txt file later. As you can see in this example from the output in the text file the mpg is surrounded by [] p  precode Your mpg is...  [37.88412609655603]    codepre  pWhat I would like to be able to do is read through the text file that the program creates and copy anything between [ and ]. The function that controls that is defined as codeaverageMilescode, I have left in and commented out some of the code Ive tried, Ive also tried a few other things but nothing works as Id like.  I know Im close but just cant quite get the last bit,p  pWhen I have managed to read the text file and extract all the mpg data into a new list I will then make it work out an average for all the mpg and print to the screen or to a file so the data must be readable.p  pIf someone could just give me a point in the right direction instead of the answer that would be great.

Negative 4557 pIve been trying to open some of the webpagedatabase solutions I made while working for my previous employer, to get a refresher on what they were, but for some reason Visual Studio Professional 2013 just decides to either crash while opening them, or crash when I try opening one of the C files I made in them.

Negative 4557 pI have two instances of a graphics WinForms control.

Render scene      this.Invalidate  codepre  pBesides high CPU usage, this method causes for starvation of invalidation of other controls One of the controls is rerendered again and again and other controls waiting for the CPU to perform their invalidation request, which is never happen unless forcing it in some way like window resize.p  pSo I removed this.Invalidate call and call it only when a refresh is needed. It does solve the problem when no animation is displayed, but if both controls show animated content the problem appears again.p  pI thought about managing all controls in the application in a centralized manager which will schedule Invalidate calls in round robin. However Im not happy with the need to know all controls in the application in one centralized location, and Im not sure if this is the right way to overcome the problem.p  pIs there a standard way to overcome this problemp

But still its not able to pick those changes.p  pThe problem is I need to set Gradle before the build is run. My question is where in OpenShift is the right place to set such configuration. In a typical linux box it would be codeUSERHOME.bashprofilecode but that in OpenShift is denied.p  pThanks again for your time.p

Negative 4557 pI am trying to figure out how to modify the value of an incoming inputrange slider that has a min value of 1 and a max value of 16 to output 1234  then when the range slider gets to value 5 the pattern repeats 1234  then when the pattern gets to what otherwise would be value 9 the pattern repeats 1234.... etc. This should also work when moving the range slider backwards.p  pThe reason I want to do this is to create a list of 4 divs of which if the id of the div matches the number of the range slider value that div highlights. The reason I am using the number 16 instead of 4 for my range slider is because I will want another list of four divs in which each only highlights on every 1 of the range slider.p  pThe problem is that if I were to write this program for a div list of 100 writing a switch statement isnt going to cut it.

I ran the debugger and both lists that I am binding to separate datagrids do contain the deserialized stream, so theyre not null. I think Im missing something. p  pHeres what I have done p  precodepublic static LotInformation DeserializedStreamstring filePath           XmlRootAttribute xRoot  new XmlRootAttribute         xRoot.ElementName  lotinformation         xRoot.IsNullable  false           Create an instance of lotinformation class.         var lot  new LotInformation           Create an instance of stream writer.

Negative 4557 pIm sure this question has been asked a thousand times, and this IS a fairly general question, but Im not looking to debug a script with errors necessarily, but to see exactly how the script is being processed, line by line, in readable or semireadable format.p  pThe idea is to gain a good understanding of how its playing out without actually putting it into a realworld scenario... adding PRINTR, or VARDUMP echos in every possible logical location... or simply throwing every possible scenario at it in an effort to produce either a PHP error, or logical error that produces an undesired result. Of course, this will be done nonetheless, but Id still like to see whats going on behind the scenes while still in the process of debugging and QA.p  pIn essence, Id like to have a tool that I can initiate at the beginning of a particular PHP function that would follow the script until completion, and produce a log file, or email, with the results. Again, NOT just the errors. I think this would be great for preQA, but unsure if anything like this even exists or why it shouldntp  pDoes a tool like this existp

Negative 4557 pI understand that a KineticJS stage can be saved to JSON with the stage.toJSON function. I would like to perform this action any time the stage changes in any way. For example, I would want to run the toJSON function if a shape was moved via draggable, a shapes size is changed, the inner contents are changed dynamically, a shape is added dynamically, etc. etc. etc. I would really prefer not to specifically listen for all of the possible events and run the same code for each. I would just prefer to capture all events in one call. Is there anything that could help me do this I realize there could be a performance hit. Saving the stage upon any change being made to it is a business requirement. Fortunately, this functionality is limited to only a few users. Thank you.p

If I use print statements to check which loops are executing, the proper loops execute every time. For some reason the text just never changes.

Negative 4557 pThis is typical pattern that I run into in Python but probably applies to most other multiparadigm languages.  p  pI write a bunch of functions. Some of these are like loaddata and some are like dosomethingwithdata. That is the latter acts on the data that is read in with the first function. Lets say it takes 1 minute to read in the data. p  pAfter a while I refactor the code so that these are both methods within a class. While this seems neater, it is also harder to develop on.

The connection is always a success, and the call to discoverServices always results in a callback to onServiceDiscovered. The characteristic I am searching for is found, and the call mConnectedGatt.writeDescriptordescriptor always returns true. However, my onCharacteristicChanged callback is never called. Instead, the program waits for about 10 seconds after the writeDescriptor call, and then I get a call to onConnectionStateChanged specifying that the connection has been lost. This happens 95 of the time. 5 of the time, everything works perfectly and I get the call to onCharacteristicChanged. p  pAre there any reasons for this timeout that keeps happening As a side note, I believe this is a problem within my android code as I can perfectly send and receive this BLE signal between iOS devices. p

And lets say we add a conditional breakpoint codeaicode. Lets just set the conditional to i10000.p  precodepublic class Main       public static void mainString[] args          int a  0          for int i  0 ilt100000 i                  a  i  put breakpoint here if i  10000                  System.out.printlnDone a  a       codepre  pNow lets instead, write the conditional ourselves.p  precodepublic class Main       public static void mainString[] args          int a  0          for int i  0 ilt100000 i              if i  10000                 a  i put a NONconditional breakpoint here             else a  i                  System.out.printlnDone a  a       codepre  pWhy is the run time of both of these so dramatically different Why is the first one so much slower p  pIn case your wondering, I am using OracleJDK8 on Linux Ubuntu.

Negative 4557 pHow stdstring is internally represented in c11 libstdcp  pWhile digging inside the implementation, I foundp  precode  A string looks like this                                            [Rep]                                          Mlength     [basicstringltchartypegt]            Mcapacity     Mdataplus                          Mrefcount     Mp gt               unnamed array of chartype      Where the Mp points to the first character in the string, and    you cast it to a pointertoRep and subtract 1 to get a    pointer to the header.      This approach has the enormous advantage that a string object    requires only one allocation.  All the ugliness is confined    within a single pair of inline functions, which each compile to    a single a add instruction RepMdata, and    stringMrep and the allocation function which gets a    block of raw bytes and with room enough and constructs a Rep    object at the front.      The reason you want Mdata pointing to the character array and    not the Rep is so that the debugger can see the string    contents. Probably we should add a noninline member to get    the Rep for the debugger to use, so users can check the actual    string length.      Note that the Rep object is a POD so that you can have a    static ltemgtempty stringltemgt Rep object already a constructed before    static constructors have run.  The referencecount encoding is    chosen so that a 0 indicates one reference, so you never try to    destroy the emptystring Rep object.      Rep string representation      Invariants      1. String really contains Mlength  1 characters due to 21.3.4         must be kept nullterminated.      2. Mcapacity gt Mlength         Allocated memory is always Mcapacity  1  sizeofCharT.      3.

Negative 4557 pThis is a RampD project. Stream Windows PCs desktop to mobile phone on Bluetooth. I am successful in streaming desktop to my Android phone with 720p but the thing is I am unable to get live stream. Encoding and Data going over Bluetooth take some milliseconds, so it is not that live. So what I did, I chose RDP for this. As RDP is only built for LAN. I have no profile for PAN. I wrote a proxy which only routes RDP packets from localhost to my computer over bluetooth. On Computer side there is another program running which takes data from bluetooth and sends this data to localhost port 3389. Now the problem I am facing is that, as connection initiated, socket gets close itself. The program only reads 80 or 45 bytes initially, then exception occurs Socket Closed.

I have two simultaneous ajax requests and would like to trigger a UI radio button click to iterate over some data returned from one of the ajax calls, which is taking 20 seconds to respond.

Why would then trigger the click if success hasent finishedp  precode    firstAjaxFunc functionargs                   return .ajax             type POST,                            url REQUESTURL  firstfunc,             contentType applicationjson,             data .toJSON                 propOne propOne,                 propTwo propTwo             ,             dataType json class.models,             context args.context,             success args.success,             error showResponseError              ,      secondAjaxFunc functionargs         return .ajax             type POST,                            url REQUESTURL  secondfunc,             contentType applicationjson,             data .toJSON                 propOne propOne,                 propTwo propTwo             ,             dataType json class.models,             context args.context,             success args.success,             error showResponseError              ,          loaddata.appendltp classspinner aligncentergtltimg src..imagesloadingsmall.gifgtltpgt         this.firstAjaxFunc             params                  propOne propOne,                 propTwo propTwo             ,             success functiondata                 this.options.stuff  data             ,             context this                  this.secondAjaxFunc             params                  propOne propOne,                 propTwo propTwo             ,             success functiondata                 this.options.moreStuff  data             ,             context this                  .whenfirstAjaxFunc, secondAjaxFunc.thenthis.find.filterall.click      .filterall click functionradio, event              this.showAllData     ,      showAllData function         forvar i  0 i lt this.options.stuff.length i  this.options.stuff is null             .mergestuffArr, this.options.stuff[i].getMyStuff              , codepre

In the Josephus problem from antiquity, N people are in dire straits and agree to the following strategy to reduce the population. They arrange them selves in a circle at positions numbered from 0 to N1 and proceed around the circle, eliminating every Mth person until only one person is left. Legend has it that Josephus figured out where to sit to avoid being eliminated. Write a Queue client Josephus that takes N and M from the command line and prints out the order in which people are eliminated and thus would show Josephus where to sit in the circle.p

Negative 4557 pI get an event and based on that event i do some processing and then fork  execvp some other program called somejazzyprogram.

With whatever i have read, i dont necessarily need to call pthreadexit since the thread automatically dies when the work its set out to do completes. In this context as soon as i do a fork  execvp it would die.p  pMy other concern is about the workthreads[index]  pthreadt  malloc sizeof pthreadt  the memory malloc that i am doing. When i use malloc i allocate memory from the heap. Where can i free this memory and release it back to the heap. Not doing anything looks like a memory leak to me.p  pIs what i am attempting here usually done  first run multiple pthreads and within each pthread do a fork  execvpp

The loaded view controller is a search bar top0px left0px right 0px and a tableview under this searchBar top0px to the search bar, left  0px right  0px bottom 0pxp  pHowever there is a margin above the search bar and between the search bar and the tableview.

Negative 4557 pVery nervous to ask this question but wanted to put this out there and get some feedback on whywhy notwhy the hell would someone want to do this.  I have various web serviceswindow service that have various configurations values that usually are stored on their respective configuration files.p  pI thought it would make sense to have a central service whose sole purpose would be to provide the respective webwindow services all the configuration details it would need. The configurations would be stored in a database table and each service would request their respective configuration via single web service. p  pMy question is does this sound like over design, or are there other ideas out there that would achieve pretty much the same thing. I feel that this would centralize the configurations therefore make it easier to manage. Also all services would have to conform to configuration interface that would have a defined property of configurationvalue pair NameValueCollection p  pAny feedback would be greatly appreciated it. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comfHAR1.png altService Topographyp

Negative 4557 pThis is slightly ridiculous and I HAVE to make a code change for our Windows service that instantiates an Excel Workbook and saves copies of the worksheets in a folder.

However this variable needs to change not only functional grid that the computer sees but also the GUI grid. Since the GUI grid isnt in the main class file I dont know how to access the variable.

Negative 4557 pIs there a strong reason why Microsoft chose not to support AppDomains in .NET Core 5 upcoming version of .NET CLR, v4.6p  pAppDomains are particularly useful when building long running server apps, where we may want to update the assemblies loaded by the server is a graceful manner, without shutting down the server.p  pWithout AppDomains, how are we going to replace our assemblies in a long running server processp  pAppDomains also provide us a way to isolate different parts of server code. Like, a custom websocket server can have socket code in primary appdomain, while our services run in secondary appdomain.p  pWithout AppDomains, the above scenario is not possible.p  pI can see an argument that may talk about using VMs concept of Cloud for handling assembly changes and not having to incur the overhead of AppDomains.

According to my current understanding of what codesendResponsecode does, the code above in particular, the line codeconsole.logrescode should be able to log the response message. However, this is not as expected and that line of code does nothing and probably isnt even reached.p  pMoreover, if I try to send a message in the background by codechrome.tabs.sendMessagecode and supplying the appropriate tab id, that works as expected but its too troublesome to fire another codesendMessagecode in the background this way.p  pWhat exactly is happening here What are the differences between codesendResponsecode and codechrome.tabs.sendMessagecode Why is my code not workingp  pAny help very much appreciated.p

For example, either code20150011code or code20150230code wont be valid.p  pThe way I am currently doing is just simply split the string into codeyearcode, codemonthcode, codedaycode, then try to validate them myself. For example, codemonthcode must be within code[1,12]code, etc.p  pBut ideally, I would like to try to parse it as a correct date, otherwise, I cant handle the case where a month is lack a day, like there is no 31 for Feb or April, etc.p  pHow can I do this validation perfectlyp

Negative 4557 pEdit For the people marking it as duplicate with logical operators, I found the link a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions27737221pythonlogicaloperatorsPython Logical Operatorsa and the answers there to be rather vague and had to deep dive into it before finding the or answer.  So while the issue here is that Python throws None, False and 0 together, great, but here we want to make a distinction between the earlier two and an actual integer or float value. That post really doesnt help my question here except for explaining some of the basic behaviour and doesnt address the how can we handle this specific situation in the most pythonic way. p  pIve ran into some unexpected behaviour with converting integers using the int... or .... I didnt notice it before, because I usually use something likep  pintvalue or 0p  pWhich always worked fine, but when I change the or 0 to another value and we enter 0, I get something I didnt expect. The example is int, but same goes for float.p  precodeIn [88] intNone or 1 Out[88] 1  In [89] int2 or 1 Out[89] 2  In [90] int0 or 1 Out[90] 1  In [91] int0 Out[91] 0 codepre  pEdit I would expect [90] to do the same as [91], but obviously it doesnt. My question here is why does it do that behaviour and stronghow can I handle this in a Pythonic way without having to resort to try excepts.strongp  pIs this because it evaluates like a boolean and 0 therefore returns the or value strongWhat is common practice to handle thisstrong Because this is a very common thing in our program and to use try except will create some ugly, not very readable code... Using python 2.7 here.p  pThis is my current workaround to get my expected behaviourp  precodetry     value  intvalue except TypeError, ValueError as e     value  1 codepre  pKind regards,p  pCarstp  pEdit 2 as the underlying mechanism is clear now, the help Im really looking for is about how to handle this situation. As stated in the comments, I mostly do this to handle Nones. Another way to handle this would bep  precodeif value is None     value  1 else     value  intvalue codepre  pWhat Im trying to understand really, is how to handle Nones in a way that does not transform the code into an endless parade of ifelse statements or write my own function that does it because to me None handling seems something that should be common.p

Negative 4557 pI want to know if my approach in the following case is correct or notp  precodeThere are 5 processes P1, P2, P3, P4 ad P5. And they can execute as follows   P1 can start any time.  P2 can start after P1 completes.  P3 can start after P1 completes.  P4 can start after both P2 and P3 complete.  P5 can start after P4 completes.  This needs to be explained using semaphores. codepre  pMy APPROACH P2 and P3 must wait on P1 say semaphore S1. P4 must wait on P2 and P3 say semaphore S2, and P5 must wait on P4 say semaphore S3. So, initially all the other processes are waiting except P1. P1 executes and S1 blocks any other process that comes. After P1 completes execution, it can post twice, so now P2 and P3 are executing and P4 and P5 are waiting. When P2 and P3 complete, S2 can post, then P4 can execute and P5 is waiting. After P4 is complete, then S3 posts and P5 then executes. p  pIs this right Also, there are a few confusions. What will be the initial values of the semaphores in each case Is it 1 for S1, 2 for S2 and 1 for S3 Also, when P1 comes to execute, then S1 becomes 0 and blocks all the other processes, similarly for other cases, but how does it know to allow only P1 and any other process firstp

Negative 4557 pI have a Volcano class. Its purpose is to randomly spray lavaMass.  In the main class I have made it so that when my character hits the lava, everything is removed, and the deleteLava function is called.p  pMy problem is that with the deleteLava function, my Volcano class stops making lava after a few deaths.p  pNow i gets a little complicated to explain. I found out that inside the deleteLava function I should also remove the lavaMass from the array, for it to keep making lava no matter how many deaths. I used lavaSpray.shift, and tried splice..  And this worked Except that it doesnt delete all the lavaMass, so everytime the character dies a few of the lavaMass objects keeps hanging around in the level, not moving. So after many deaths there is a lot of lavaMass objects just standing still, not moving and not being deleted.p  pHeres the volcano classp  ppackage  p  precodeimport flash.display.MovieClip import flash.events.Event  public class Volcano extends MovieClip       var lavaSprayArray  []     var lavaNumNumber     var worldWorld      public function LavaThing          addEventListenerEvent.ENTERFRAME, makeLava           public function deleteLava              this.parent.removeChildthis         for var m  0 m lt lavaSpray.length m          if lavaSpray[m].parent           lavaSpray[m].parent.removeChildlavaSpray[m]                                  function makeLava eEvent              lavaNum  Math.random70         if lavaSpray.lengthlt20                          if lavaNum gt 68.15                                      var lavaMass  new LavaMass                     lavaSpray.pushlavaMass                     addChildlavaMass                     lavaMass.scaleY  0.5                     lavaMass.scaleX  0.5                     lavaMass.x  90                     lavaMass.y  Math.random30                     lavaMass.y  Math.random30                                        for each lavaMass in lavaSpray                              lavaMass.x  4                 if lavaMass.parent ampamp  lavaMass.x gt 800                          lavaMass.parent.removeChildlavaMass             lavaSpray.shift                             codepre  p p  pI hope someone knows what Im talking about.

Negative 4557 pI am using client credentials flow using Spring OAuth2. The DefaultAuthenticationKeyGenerator stores the accesstoken in memory for me. However if I run multiple client instances from different hosts and make the oauthtoken clientcredentials grant request, I get the SAME access token. So all client instances with the same client id and client secret get the same access token. So I must be misunderstanding something fundamentally. Is there a way to have each instance of my client receive its own unique client credentials flow access token with its own expiration period  The reason I want this is so I can authenticate the client itself before a user account has been created. After the user account is created I can use the user resource password grant flow to get a user specific accesstoken.p

Negative 4557 pI need all your inputs for a use case with SSO implementation. Let me explain you my use case. I have couple of applications which written way back in 2004  2005 with ASP.NET, C, SQL etc.. and uses ASP.NET cookie based Form Authentication to maintain the SSO between these web applications. It is working great and no issues so far. Now in early 2015, we are in the initial stage of building next generation application using HTML5, Angular JS amp Web API which should work in all platforms amp devices. So we decided to move with JWT Token based authentication in the new applications to maintain the SSO between. But the curtail use case pitch in now that is, the new set of application also should allow user to go back to their old applications by not asking any login information  eventually, SSO between new applications vs old application. Since both uses different way of authentication, it is not going to be a straight forward implementation My guess .p  pWould any of you come across such situation before Any suggestions. Advance thanks for all of you.p

I change the collation of a specific column in my table from latin1swedishci to hebrewbin, and this changes the data in that column. For instance I inserted codecolecode in the field, and on conversion, I got codecolecode.  So I searched for a solution and found a hrefhttpsdev.mysql.comdocrefman5.1encharsetconversion.html relnofollowthisa. You can see it states that to not loose data on changing charsets and collations, you must convert to blob and then to the required charset. I tried that too, only to get codecolecode. So how can I change column collations without loosing data.p  pThese were my queries for the blob attempt  p  precodeALTER TABLE something CHANGE name name BLOB ALTER TABLE something CHANGE name name VARCHAR12 CHARACTER SET hebrew COLLATE hebrewbin NOT NULL codepre
Negative 4557 pWere still using SourceGear Vault as VCS for some of our older projects.p  pVault provides a html web interface called emVaultWebem which enabled you to view the latest checkins, transactions and so on.p  pFor example you can view a list of the most recent checkins via an uri like this a hrefhttpsourcegear.service.foo.barVaultServiceVaultWebRecentCheckins.aspxrepid42ampdays7 relnofollowhttpsourcegear.service.foo.barVaultServiceVaultWebRecentCheckins.aspxrepid42ampdays7ap  pThis lists all checkins in repository 42 coderepid42code within the last week codedays7code. What Im wondering is there any way to filter the result at a more detailed level At least Id like to filter the checkins per user. So I thought appending a query parameter like codeampusernamealicecode would do the trick. But this doesnt filter anything...p  pDoes anybody have an idea I searched the web but didnt find anything helpful list of parameters or something like that...p
Negative 4557 pWe are working with AWS Redshift DB and would like to create an online replicate such that is fully updated with changes as wellp  pThe reason is that we wish to have a separate environment for one of our departments to run their own queries, and as they might go crazy and do some supercomplex queries they need free style, and I cant control what will they do, I dont want it to overload the main Redshift and take up all the resources for my main users. A replica will solve it as it will create an environment of their own.p

Negative 4557 pFrom what I understand Docker containers can be constrained to not use more than a specified amount of memory via the codemcode switch.  For instancep  precodedocker run... m 512k ... codepre  pwill constrain the container to not using more than 512Mb of memory.  Everything good so far.  However, I have read, and reread, the notes on the subject in the Docker documentation a hrefhttpsdocs.docker.comreferencerunruntimeconstraintsoncpuandmemory relnofollowherea.  I find this rather difficult to understand.  I gather the general impression that one can go beyond the simple codemcode switch and constrain the container to use a specified amount of physical memory and a different specified amount of swap memory.  Is this correct  If so, just how would one issue the codedocker runcode command to specify both constraints  Id much appreciate any help with this.p

Negative 4557 pHere is the deal, I have an application in which the device listens to iBeacons in the background and timestamps the moment user passes the area in range. Initially, as soon as I get a didEnter call back I used the chance to save the information to the iCloud using CloudKit. But sometimes on a bad luck, the internet is not available at that very moment and saving fails e.g. when the user is in elevator. p  pI tried to use FMDB to write the information to database and sync them when app enters foreground. That doesnt work either. Since iOS8 by default encrypts the disk and does not allow me to write to disk after the phone gets locked by the user or the phone get a reboot eventhough there are some APIs in NSFileManager to let you write to a file until its open called NSFileProtectionCompleteUnlessOpen but they dont work after few hours of phone being locked. Perhaps a bug. p  pThird solution was to write them into a array and use reachability to sync them to iCloud as soon as I get a chance on location callbacks, appdelegate callbacks or reachbilityChanges notification. But this solution is not secure to app termination. If the user termiate the app I dont have enough time to do anything. p  pThe last solution is a mix of all together. Write to array if the disk is encrypted. write to disk if not encrypted. sync them all together and save to internet at any time possible. Do not want to put myself in alot of hassles before getting some help.p  pDo you have any idea how to deal with thisp

I have the URLs mapped so removing the virtual works just fine everywhere. Occasionally the virtual directory disappears and then returns.  I can make no sense of when it disappears and reappears.p  pOnce I brought it up and it only showed the base URL www.thesignupplace.com and would not show the HTML on a View Page Source. The underlying URLs all worked even they did not show.  I have no idea how I caused that to happen and I would like to know how to make it happen again.p  pThere was an post in 2011 like this but it does not make any sense in Visual Studio 2013 with ASP.NET 4.5 with the RouteConfig.cs class.p  pI tried a basehref suggestion that then changed my localhost to the website and did not get rid of the virtual directory in the URL.p

Negative 4557 pI have a requirement for a Windows Phone 8.1 app that has need to connect to an external device. This external device has a WiFi network that the app connects to that broadcasts via TCP on a specific port.p  pThe external device intermittently sends SOAP requests, indicating to the app that there is a new file available from the device. The flow for a single file is as followsp  ol liDevice sends request Ali liApp sends response Ali liDevice sends request Bli liDevice sends file data in bytesli liApp receives filedata and saves locallyli liOnce finished, app sends response B, indicating that the file transfer was successfulli ol  pI am currently using a StreamSocketListener to accomplish the connection. If there is one file, the app works fine. However, when multiple files are available it is not working I assume, because the device is sending the requests all at once or very close to each other.p  pWhat is the best way to handle multiple requests coming from this device in a way that the files can be retrieved simultaneously without stepping on the other connections Any suggestions are greatly appreciated.p

I found the reason and the problem was codeshmgetcode and codeshmopencode API failure. I checked error number and the reason was codepermissioncode.p  pThen, it means that chromiumbrowseror chrome doesnt allow their child processor thread to use shared memory, I guess. strongFirststrong, is it correct p  pSo, I read some a hrefhttpswww.chromium.orgdevelopersmemoryusagebackgrounder relnofollowdocumentsa about chromiumbrowsers memory model and there I found that chromiumbrowser is using shared memory.

Negative 4557 pIve been learning SIP for a while now but I cant think of a way to accomplish a scenario which I have in my mind.p  pLets assume I have a number of SIP clients and a SIP server at home, in a private network behind a NATfirewall, inaccessible from the public Internet. Then theres a SIP server in the public Internet which I also have access to. Now assume I also have a mobile device with a SIP client. Im interested in the ability to make and receive phone calls between all SIP clients in this one logical network, regardless of the mobile SIP client being connected to the private network or to the public Internet the system should adapt to changes in the environment. Additionally, I need to make sure that the SIP server in the private network could work on its own, when the connection to the public Internet is not available. That is, the connection to the public Internet is an optional extension in this setup, which possibly enables mobile SIP clients to be connected to the private network.p  pI dont really know if thats possible with SIP protocol and its extensions. Im curious how these two SIP servers would be connected in what mode so that it could work.p  pDo you know what software do I need to implement such a scenario, e.g. FreeSWITCH, Asterisk, Kamailiop  pAny hints would be appreciated.p

Negative 4557 pId like to create a simple wrapper for computations. The builtin scala monads codeTraversableLikecode seems sufficient for me. And they have already syntax sugar. From some point of view scala collection traits are accidental monads. And there intended monads provided by the scalaz library.p  pWhat uses cases benefit from complex type classed monads of scalaz What functionality is unfeasible for builtin monads and indicate need for scalazp  hr  pSome clarification.p  pThis question is not a holy war inheritance vs type classes. My question is about infrastructure that provides scalaz. Not any library with type classes approach, but this mentioned library. It slightly complicates things. But also it have bunch of utility classes that have no matches in scala collection library. Because it is a collection library, not a monadic. So the question is about the additional functionality provided by scalaz. In which cases does it matterp

Negative 4557 pI wanted to check the viability of the design approach to use Message Oriented middleware MOM technology like JMS or ActiveMQ or RabbitMQ for handling asynchronous processing within single web application i.e. the publisher and the subscriber to the MOM server will be contained in the same web application. The rationale behind this design is to offload some of the heavy duty processing functionality as a background asynchronous operation. The publisher in this case is the server side realtime web service method which need to respond back instantaneously lt than 1 sec to the calling web service client and the publisher emits the message on MOM Topic. The subscriber is contained in the same web application as the publisher and the subscriber uses the message to asynchronously processes the complex slightly more time consuming 57 seconds functionality. With this design we can avoid having to spawn new threads within the application server container for handling the heavy duty complex processing functionality.p  pDoes using MOM server in this case an overkill  where the message publisher and message subscriber are contained in the same web server address space From what I have read MOM tech is used mainly for interapplication communication and wanted to check if it is fine to use MOM for intraapplication communication.p  pLet know your thoughts.p  pThanks,p
Negative 4557 pI want to build a trigger to fix some kind of bug inside a Program. There are different rows in t2 and the program merges selected ones together in t1 and gives them one single id.

For lack of a better term this lists only has children but no grandchildren so there is no need to expand or collapse to that level.p  pCurrently with this example the parent collapses and expands when I click on the arrow or the text which is exactly the behavior I want.  However when one of the childrens checkboxes is clicked this also causes the parent to collapse. This is not the desired effect.

Negative 4557 pThis is such a strange issue. Im not sure even how to troubleshoot it...p  pI wrote a very simple piece of code for a Raspberry Pi at the entrance of my house. It just poles the GPIO every 2 seconds to see if the circuit has been completed. Its connected via GPIO to a magnetic door sensor, like one of these a hrefhttpss3.amazonaws.comassets.controlanything.comphotosCKN6004900.jpg relnofollowhttpss3.amazonaws.comassets.controlanything.comphotosCKN6004900.jpgap  pHere is the python codep  precodeimport os import time import socket import RPi.GPIO as io io.setmodeio.BCM  ADDRESS  192.168.1.118 PORT  1234  def doorOpened     report door has been opened     try         s  socket.socketsocket.AFINET, socket.SOCKSTREAM         s.connectADDRESS, PORT         s.sendbDOOROPEN     except Exception as e         printException   e     s.close     return  DOORPIN  23  io.setupDOORPIN, io.IN printWatching over the door while True     time.sleep2     if io.inputDOORPIN         doorOpened         time.sleep60 codepre  pAnyways, for some reason, like maybe once a week, the alarm will get triggered falsely. Sometimes when Im sleeping, at work, whatever. Im not sure how the code could possibly be reading a value from the GPIO as long as the magnets are close to one another, it shouldnt complete the circuit. Ive played with opening the door and they have to be about 1.52 inches away from one another before the the sensor gets triggered, so I have no idea how it could possibly trigger while theyre basically touching less than 1 mm apart.p  pSo... does anyone have any ideas or explanationsp  pThanksp

Negative 4557 pSo I recently was creating what a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosdocumentationUserExperienceConceptualAutolayoutPGImplementingViewImplementingView.htmlapplerefdocuidTP40010853CH16SW1 relnofollowApple calls a emleaflevel viewema a button and so I followed Apples docs to implement codeintrinsicContentSizecode and everything worked albeit the code felt a bit weird  I had constraints set up in my codeupdateConstraintscode method to position subviews, as well as code in the codeintrinsicContentSizecode method to calculate what the total size should be it felt like I was giving duplicate information to the autolayout system. p  pHowever, I also ran into a a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions19170053resizesuperviewaftersubviewschangedynamicallyusingautolayoutpost on herea claiming to, instead of using codeintrinsicContentSizecode, use rigid constraints and then the containerview will automatically resize to fit the views it contains. I also implemented this, and achieved the same result as above, but this time I didnt feel like I was duplicating information sent I just sent the straight constraints. Note that I see the view as described in the post mentioned above as a so called emleaflevel viewem since it doesnt sound like any other view would be added to it.p  pWhich implementation of resizing a container view based on the content inside of it is the proper way to gop  hr  pIm currently leaning towards the second method, due to the fact that I dont think I should be sending duplicate information, however Apples documentation says otherwise then again, Apples docs can be a bit confusingmisleading at times.p  hr  pSidenote about my specific situation, f it matters I have two subviews in my button, one being an image, the other being a label. The image gets its size from the label, and then the entire button from the image so indirectly the sizing comes entirely from the label.p

Negative 4557 pI would like to generate a plot of a vtkUnstructuredGrid colored by a component of a vector. I can do this by reading the vtufile produced by the code below in paraview, where I can select e.g. the ycomponent of the displacement vector. However, I cant figure out how to do this directly in the python script. By setting the variable component equal to 0 I get the xcomponent, as expected. I cant seem to be able to select any other component for display.p  pOne possibility is probably by using a calculation filter and creating a new scalar array, but Im sure there is a more straightforward way.

Negative 4557 pIve installed a cluster with impala and sentry CDH 5.2 on CentOS 6.5 using command line and have set up openLDAP without TLS as well. Both are operating without any issues independently. p  pTo get the Hadoop cluster configured for openLDAP, Ive created the required LDAP groups for all the hadoop services as well as have made required entries in coresite.xml and impala config file listing the LDAP uri etc as mentioned by the documentation.  p  pWhen I invoke impalashell for LDAP users using impalashell l u test1 where test1 is a valid openLDAP user, it asks for password, which I supply. The problem is that once this is done  it just hangs. There is absolutely no response at all from impalashell and neither impala logs nor LDAP logs reacord any activity. I also tried capturing tcpdump on port 389 where ldap runs, but it seems there is no communication there from Impala as there are no packets exchanged at all. In contrast, it works perfectly when invoked without the l directive for normal centOS users.

Negative 4557 pThis isnt a problem as much as it is a curiosity. I created a simple sendreceive C application using UDP, mostly following the MSDN examples on UdpClient. I have a textbox acting as a log for when things are sent or received it prints the timestamp and what was sentreceived from where.p  pThe curiosity comes in with the port numbers.

Is the port meaningless when receiving a packet, and thats why its           always something random Or is there some meaning to it that Im           unaware of          ConsoleLogend.ToString   Recv   recvString           Start the listen cycle again so this will be called again         listener.BeginReceivenew AsyncCallbackReceiveCallback, state      catch ObjectDisposedException           Do nothing  Expected error when the UDP Listener is closed.       codepre  pIs the port number when receiving packets just meaningless garbage data, or does it have some sort of usep

Negative 4557 pSo I came across placement new recently, and I had a question regarding it. I do understand that placement new is used when you want to allocate an object on an already allocated memory.p  pLets say I have a class called foo, which is 20 bytes.p  pId do some operations with it, and then Ill call a placement new for a class called bar, which is 10 bytes.p  pWhat happens to the last 10 bytes that is not part of the new object Does placement new partition only the amount of memory required, which is in this case 10 bytes Or does the pointer just carry around the extra 10 bytes until it is deallocatedp  pAnd another case, lets say Ive first started by allocating memory for class bar, which is 10 bytes. Ill then placement new class foo, which is 20 bytes. Will the compiler allocate more memory Or do I have to make sure to allocate enough memory beforehandp

Negative 4557 pOK, so for a couple of weeks Ive been getting to grips with Symfony. Coming from working with Drupal a lot and wanting more control Ive really grasped a lot of Symfony concepts great However in trying to replicate and entity field type which allows multiple images to be attached to and removed from an entity Im really banging my head against a brick wall with this.p  pWe are talking about a Product with a Gallery or numerous other scenarios where many images would relate to one thing.p  pIve followed the Symfony Cookbook article on embedding forms and failed to get a usable instance of One product allowing upload of Many images.p  pIm just a bit surprised that there isnt a bundle or even some better documentation out there to handle what I would of thought to be highly demanded functionality.p  pIve looked briefly at the CMF but to be honest I like the simplicity of the standalone Symfony system as it has a simplistic appeal for very small CMS sites and systems that dont require the concepts talked about in CMF. If I were after a lot of that functionality then I would sooner revert to Drupal or similar.p  pCan anyone shed any light on thisp  pBTW. Im not interested in creating the product first and then creating multiple images and relating them to the product. I could figure this out if necessary. It needs to be driven via on createedit form.p

Negative 4557 pI have a table of transactions. For any given record, I want to be able to include a portal which shows all related transactions. Since the related records are in the same table as the parent record, I have created a second table occurrence TO. I have linked these two TOs with a join table, into which I enter the foreign keys of the two TOs to indicate which records relate to which other records.p  pOn the layout for a given transaction, Ive added a portal which displays related records from the second table occurrence. So far, so good.p  pSo, lets say in the join table I said transaction 100 is linked to transactions 105 and 110. In the portal for transaction 100, I can see records 105 amp 110.p  pHowever, I would also like to see transaction 100 in the portal for transaction 105, but cant figure out how to do this, without having to manually enter the same relationship, but in reverse.p  pNB.
