Positive 28949 pIm using cocos2d to build kof. I want to use box2d to do physics stuff. Now there is a problem.  How to make a current sprite size box when sprite is changing eventlistener  hope someone has similar experience can help p
Positive 28949 pI almost finished the core of my game, which I develop with Cocos2D and now Im in stage of implementing the UI. p  pImplementing the UI I want via code or even via Spritebuilder is a big pain.p  pIm thinking about using Cocos2D only for game view and implement everything else with AutoLayout. My problem is that I dont understand the basics of how CoreGraphics which I bet UIKit is based on works. p  pMy question is will there be any perfomance drop if I will use UIKit for menus and pause screen and Cocos2D for rendering the game itself. It is important for me, because my game is very high load in terms of perfomance.p
Positive 28949 pCan anyone help here pleasep  pI submitted version 2 of my app only to have it rejected as it crashed on a number of devices running 8.4 .p

Positive 28949 pSo the premise of my problem is that I apply an alpha mask with a fragment shader to a circular CCSprite. Then I want to rotate the CCSprite while keeping the alpha mask in the same position. If I apply the mask and then rotate the sprite, the mask will rotate with the sprite. If I rotate the sprite and then apply the mask, the mask will be in the rotated position because I base it off the texture of the Sprite which never rotates.p  pIs there a way I can get the cctexture2d to rotate in a way that the mask will stay in place while the sprite is rotated or do I need to apply a custom vertex shader to the mask or the ccpsrite texture If custom, what would the matrix transformations look likep

Ideasp  pThe code uses a custom physics engine, checking tiles surrounding the character for collisions once every update interval. Sometimes, a character falls through tiles. I suspect that it happens because the character is moving fast enough to pass through enough tile to be on the other size by the time, the update selector is called. I am thinking whether this is the case and what should be donep  ol lireplace physics engine with box2d or something,li liimprove physics engine to keep last coordinate and to check whether it skipped a tile or tiles, and if yes whether a collision should have occurred,li litune character speed bounds,li lisomething else clever. li ol  pDoes it make sense that a simple collision detection system, checking only for collisions with surrounding tiles, could allow objects slip thru barriersp  pThank youp

The following code a category on codeCCSpritecode works perfectly, as long as I have my pixel mode set to codekCCTexture2DPixelFormatRGBA8888code.

Doing so immediately reduces the memory usage on my game by 13, and this is the only feature that does not look good with the lowered resolution. Instead of yielding a white silhouette, it yields a black one. This is problematic because I cannot subsequently recolor the sprite via codesilhouette.color  ccBLUEcode or what have you.p  pIve been reading everything I can find, and I simply cannot grok why this is not working. I know that, ideally, Id write a shader to do this for me, but this solution actually looks really nice when it works for my needs.p  pFWIW... these operations are happening while other animations are happening on the screen. AFAIK theres no crosstalk that can happen, but frankly Im not as solid on my OpenGL guts as I should be.p

You can see that I have a codeCCSchedulercode which called an update function which triggered the UI to draw a sprite.

Negative 28949 pWhy doesnt Java include support for unsigned integers  p  pIt seems to me to be an odd omission, given that they allow one to write code that is less likely to produce overflows on unexpectedly large input.  p  pFurthermore, using unsigned integers can be a form of selfdocumentation, since they indicate that the value which the unsigned int was intended to hold is never supposed to be negative.  p  pLastly, in some cases, unsigned integers can be more efficient for certain operations, such as division.  p  pWhats the downside to including thesep

Heres my situationp  pIm hitting a web service over my companys intranet. I have used svcutil.exe to generate the client class for WCF. I was able to run the web service call with no problem when the service was in development and did not require authentication credentials, so I know the code works. At the time, the code was running over SSL. I imported the required certificate into the Trusted Root Certification Authorities store, and everything was fine.p  pWe just moved to a stage environment, and the service was upgraded to require credentials to connect.

Negative 28949 pIm fairly new to programming and am working for my dissertation on a web crawler. Ive been provided by a web crawler but i found it to be too slow since it is single threaded. It took 30 mins to crawl 1000 webpages. I tried to create multiple threads for execution and with 20 threads simultaneously running the 1000 webpages took only 2 minutes. But now Im encountering Heap Out of Memory errors. Im sure what i did was wrong which was create a strongforstrong loop for 20 threads. What would be the right way to multithread the java crawler without giving out the errors And speaking of which, is multithreading the solution to my problem or notp
Negative 28949 pId like to sift text in particular, Twitter messages to see if they relate to a particular topic. Have you been down that road If so, Id love to hear what approach youd use.p  pFor my case, just searching for topic keywords gets me useful text about 7 of the time the keywords have multiple meanings, some of which arent on topic. For my use, automatic filtering doesnt need to be perfect Id be happy if the extracted messages related to the topic 80 of the time. Im also willing to lose 1030 of the ontopic messages.p  pDoing a first pass by hand, there are some characteristics that make messages pretty likely to be good, like certain English phrases. Other characteristics give a high likelihood of rejection, like URLs, multiple hash tags, and other phrases. Others are harder to evaluate.p  pI could manually make a bunch of regexes and associated weights, and tweak things by hand until I got output I liked. That could well work. But I can name several other possible approaches, and Im wondering which ones Stack Overflow readers have had good luck with.p  pThanksp

Negative 28949 pOne of the more powerful features of modern day browsers is the ability for software developers to write browser extensions to enhance, modify and tweak the pages visited by the user.  As more of our lives migrate onto the browser, arent we potentially exposing ourselves to a massive privacy and security holes created by the installation of a browser extension that is malicious in naturep  pI realize the source code of these extensions is extractable and readable if the author has not made attempts to obfuscate the behavior.  But the effectiveness of this type of review is compromised by the browser encouraging users to keep their extensions up to date.  While version 1.0 of an extension may be innocuous, a users browser may suggest an upgrade to version 1.1 which could contain malicious code which could be used to scrape information from the screen of the compromised browser.p  pAs both a user and developer of browser extensions, is the developers reputation the only thing in place to provide assurances to their users that their browsing activity will be secure  Are there any mechanisms in place to help protect users from a compromised browser extensionp  pAre there any bestpractices to develop extensions in a manner that provides users with the assurance that the code they install and update is benign in naturep

Negative 28949 pI realise there have been a few posts regarding where to add a cache checkupdate and the separation of concerns between the controller, the model and the caching code.p  pThere are two great examples that I have tried to work with but being new to MVC I wonder which one is the cleanest and suits the MVC methodology the best I know you need to take into account DI and unit testing.p  pExample 1 Helper method with delegatep  p...in controllerp  precodevar myObject  CacheDataHelper.GetthisID,  gt WebServiceServiceWrapper.GetMyObjectBythisIDthisID codepre  pExample 2 check for cache in model class in controller p  precodevar myObject    WebServiceServiceWrapper.GetMyObjectBythisIDthisID codepre  pthen in model class..............p  precodeif CacheDataHelper.Getcachekey, out myObject   do some repository processing   Add obect to cache CacheDataHelper.AddmyObject, cachekey   codepre  pBoth use a static cache helper class but the first example uses a method signature with a delegate method passed in that has the name of the repository method being called. If the data is not in cache the method is called and the cache helper class handles the adding or updating to the current cache.p  pIn the second example the cache check is part of the repository method with an extra line to call the cache helper add method to update the current cache.p  pDue to my lack of experience and knowledge I am not sure which one is best suited to MVC. I like the idea of calling the cache helper with the delegate method name in order to remove any cache code in the repository but I am not sure if using the static method in the controller is idealp  pThe second example deals with the above but now there is no separation between the caching check and the repository lookup. Perhaps that is not a problem as you know it requires caching anywayp

We also use transactions to encapsulate the whole payment generation process.p  pAs part of this, we need the whole transaction to fail if there is a duplicate uuid, but getting an actual database error will show an error to the user.

Negative 28949 pI got a weird problem. I have a program that does many things but also show pdf via axAcroPDF control. In the control, I hide the toolbar because I dont want the user to have access to them, so I made a Print button the only feature I want them to have access.p  pNow, I went throu the hell to find how to change the default printer because Adobe thought it would be smart to not allow to pass the printer path in their printAll function, go figure.p  pThere is 2 kind of paper, one cheap and one very expensive, so depending of what type of document, it will print on one printer else the other and must not screw up else it will be expensive.p  pSo here it goes, PrintA is the default printer for everything and PrintB is the expensive paper printer.p  pIf I print with PrintB, my program keep in memory the current default printer, switch the default printer to PrintB, print the document, then switchback to PrintA.  Problem is, after that if I try to print a normal document, it will print with PrintB even if PrintA is the default printer.p  pThe opposite is also true. If I print a normal document with PrintA first, after that, it will still use PrintA to print special documment.p  pThis will do it until I close the program. So I thought at first it was my program, but I debugged it and everything was fine. I even test with printWithDialog and first time it pass throu it, it will pop the dialog, but subsequent times it pass throu, it will do nothing Op  pSo I am totally lost on how to fix this and I feel I will need to give access to the toolbar and have them set the printer and amount of prints themselves which is a very very bad idea, you have no idea how dumb they are.p

Negative 28949 pBy default, many of you know, IE has a 2px border around the body tag. IE considers this border as outside of the regular page. Basically, this means that the document origin is actually at [borderLeftWidth, borderTopWidth].p  pThis poses problems when doing calculations in JavaScript that require both clientXY and screenXY. Since there is a border in between the two values, you have to compensate by adding in the borderWidth. By default this border is 2px unless you modify the page.p  pHowever, since the body can have a userdefined border as well like 7px solid red, you cant just compensate by adding or subtracting 2px. Obviously, you would need to use the actual value codedocument.body.currentStyle[borderTopWidth]code. By default, this returns codemediumcode. Since the value codemediumcode can vary across browser versions, you would need to perform getPixelValue check I used a hrefhttpblog.stchur.com20060920convertingtopixelswithjavascript relnofollowhttpblog.stchur.com20060920convertingtopixelswithjavascripta.p  pWhen you perform this check, codemediumcode returns code4pxcode. But thats not right The bodys border is actually code2pxcode, even though it says its codemediumcode. That made me think, IE might render values differently for the body border. But after manually setting the borderWidth to codemediumcode, it corrects itself to 4px. For some reason, IE lies about the bodys default borderWidth.p  pSo, my question is is there any way of getting the real value of the bodys border Or is there a way to check whether the user has set the border already so it no longer is the default 2px. Performing a useralteredborder check would definitely be my last resort, since IE may decide to remove the default border, thus breaking my scripts.p

Negative 28949 pIm working on a CMS that can run either with or without https enabled on the webserver. Id like to be able to detect whether https is enabled or not, so that I can act accordingly for example, display some httpsrelated options to the administrator, and redirect to https for administrator logins.p  pIm not looking for Request.IsSecureConnection because that only tells me if the current request is via https. I want something that will tell me whether the current bindings for the site in IIS include a binding for https at the same domain as the current request is on. So, for example, even if the current request is for codehttpexample.comcode and thus not secure, I want to know whether codehttpsexample.comcode would work so I can for example redirect the user to it if they log in as administrator.p  pIve had no luck looking for anything in System.Web.Configuration that will tell me about the bindings of the current site, though.p  pMy current workaround is just to require the administrator to set an appSetting in web.config if https is enabled, but Id prefer if I could make it automatic. Having to set the same thing twice  once in IIS and once in web.config  is confusing.p

Negative 28949 pI have been looking at the feasibility of porting over an intranet web app from ASP DOTNET to ASP MVC. I have not yet decided whether or not this kind of framework would be suitable for the application.p  pOne consideration is what the routing would look like...p  pThe main use of the application is to CRUD 7 main types of objects, which, for illustration, include representations of customers, locations and persons. A customer can have multiple locations lt 10, which can each have many persons maybe 1000s. Pages will either focus on the details or editing often by multipage wizards  another post though of specific objects, or the listing out with filtering of sets of objects eg persons related to a particular object eg a customer.p  pJust considering customers, beyond CRUD I will want to be able to list the various objects related to a specific customer like locations and persons, page them, and also filter them by certain properties or keywords from a textbox. Currently, to view a customers persons you would go to customerguid1234persons where there is a RadControls data grid containing all the persons large request but bandwidth is not bottleneck.p  pSo what would you recommend for routesp  pEasybr CustomerEdit[GUID]p  pHarderbr CustomerList[GUID]Persons[Page]filterxyzampparamXYZbr orbr CustomerListPersonscustomerguidamp...br or ...p

Negative 28949 pI have looked everywhere and found millions of python proxy servers but none do precisely what i would like i think sp  pI have had quite a bit of experience with python generally, but im quite new to the world of the deep dark secrets of the HTTP protocol.p  pWhat i think might be useful would be a very simple proxy example that can be connected to and will then itself try to connect to the address passed to it.p  pAlso, i think what has been confusing me is everything the hidden stuff is doing, e.g. if the class inherits from BaseHTTPServer.BaseHTTPRequestHandler what precisely happens when a page is requested, as in many of the examples i have found there is no reference to path variable then suddenly poof self.path is used in a function. im assuming its been inherited, but how does it end up with the path usedp  pim sorry if that didnt make much sense, as my idea of my problem is probably scrambled p  pif you can think of anything which would make my question clearer please, please suggest i add it. xxxp  pEditp  pAlso, a link to an explaination of the detailed processes through which the proxy handles the request, requests the page how to readmodify the data at this point and passes it to the original requester would be greatly appreciated xxxxp

Negative 28949 pAs far as I can see, the way you normally create Property Sheets in Win32 I am using the API, not MFC programming is you have a bunch of dialog templates for each tab page, and you make the property sheet out of them.

How do you add controls to a Property Sheet programatically at runtime, just like you can create a codeBUTTONcode and add it to a Window at runtimep
Negative 28949 pSo I need to test some view models that have a private field containing an adapter, this adapter gets manipulated via ICommands  input  etc from the views, I think this is a pretty common model, the view exposes some public properties that are specific to what that particular view is all about and then then the adapter is concelled in a private field. Now my problem is testing. I am using Unity to register an instance of that adapter and then each view model gets that same instance of course but I cant test it cause it is private so I created an accessor class but I cant figure out how to create and instance of it.

Negative 28949 pIm a bit confused concerning proper usage of C namespaces. It is clear for me how they can help to avoid conflicts name collision, but it is not clear anymore when it comes to the codeusingcode keyword. I mean, suppose I have a part of my code that I put into a namespace, and create a class, sayp  precodenamespace my      class vector  ...   codepre  pOf course, when I use it, I wouldnt like to type codemyvectorcode all the time, so Id like codeusing namespace mycode. However, I could eventually need something from the codestdcode namespace, and then I want codeusing namespace stdcode at the same time, but this will bring me back to the initial name collision problem.p  pI know that it is possible to import only the functionality that I need, like codeusing stdsetcode, but in this case it seems natural to import both the standard namespace codestdcode and codemycode namespace completely as Id use both of them all the time.p  pDoes this mean that even when I use namespaces I should still think about giving noncommon names to my types Or is codeusing namespacecode a mistake and I should always type codemyvectorcode instead Thanks.p  hr  pWell, I should probably clarify that it is more a question of readability than typing. Lots of codecode everywhere look really weird to me. I know its a question of taste and habits, but nevertheless.p

Negative 28949 pSo, Im trying to create a specific XML format for the consumers of an API Im creating. Effectively, you would have a model like sop  precodepublic class SampleModel       public ErrorCodeEnum ErrorCode  get set       public ListltErrorgt LocalizedErrors  get set       public object AdditionalInformation  get set   codepre  pNow lets say I have a sample model like sop  precodeSampleModel model  new SampleModel model.ErrorCode  ErrorCodeEnum.InvalidParameters model.LocalizedErrors  new ListltErrorgt      new Error  For  SomeField, Message  Your SomeField value is unacceptable. ,     new Error  For  SomeField2, Message  Your SomeField2 value is unacceptable. ,  model.AdditionalInformation  new SomeOtherType  SomeProperty  Whatever  codepre  pId want to make sure that serializes into something like thisp  precodeltxmlgt ltSampleModelgt    ltErrorCodegtInvalidParametersltErrorCodegt    ltErrorsgt        ltError ForSomefieldgtYour SomeField value is unacceptable.ltErrorgt        ltError ForSomefield2gtYour SomeField2 value is unacceptable.ltErrorgt    ltErrorsgt    ltSomePropertygtWhateverltSomePropertygt ltSampleModelgt codepre  pIve solved a fair amount of this problem, but one stickler remains. Basically, right now, it all serializes out like sop  precodeltxmlgt ltSampleModelgt    ltErrorCodegtInvalidParametersltErrorCodegt    ltErrorsgt        ltError ForSomefieldgtYour SomeField value is unacceptable.ltErrorgt        ltError ForSomefield2gtYour SomeField2 value is unacceptable.ltErrorgt    ltErrorsgt    ltAdditionalInformationgt        ltSomePropertygtWhateverltSomePropertygt    ltAdditionalInformationgt ltSampleModelgt codepre  pThe default XmlSerializer is outputting the name of the property in this case AdditionalInformation around the serialized nodes of its value. Ive been trying multiple ways to get rid of this node. What Id like to see is basically my dictionary of values to be appended at the 1 child deep level of the XML Root, and get rid of the AdditionalInformation. So if I had a model like sop  precodeSampleModel model  new SampleModel model.ErrorCode  ErrorCodeEnum.InvalidParameters model.LocalizedErrors  new ListltErrorgt      new Error  For  SomeField, Message  Your SomeField value is unacceptable. ,     new Error  For  SomeField2, Message  Your SomeField2 value is unacceptable. ,  model.AdditionalInformation  new AThirdType  Foo  Bar, Bing  Baz  codepre  pId get the following XMLp  precodeltxmlgt ltSampleModelgt    ltErrorCodegtInvalidParametersltErrorCodegt    ltErrorsgt        ltError ForSomefieldgtYour SomeField value is unacceptable.ltErrorgt        ltError ForSomefield2gtYour SomeField2 value is unacceptable.ltErrorgt    ltErrorsgt    ltFoogtBarltFoogt    ltBinggtBazltBinggt ltSampleModelgt codepre  pIs this possible without going through the effort of making my own XmlSerializer  Deserializerp

I then need to use those custom xs and ys the calculate the average of three points.p  pThis is what I mean in picture form I would like to do this without grid lines, but thats not important img srchttpi.imgur.com7Lw5b.png alttargetp  pThe problem is a simple one to solve, but from a user interface perspective and from an iPad perspective I dont know the best way to display this information. Any help is greatly appreciated.p

Negative 28949 pIn a simple MFC application, I need to have a worker thread that constantly poll an ioctl for an event. At first, I attempted to achieve this using nonoverlapped ioctl inside a while loop. The way I figured it is that if the ioctl does not complete io request immediately the thread will transfer control or context switch to another threadthe main thread or the MFC message control loop but instead it locks up the application. p  pIn a second attempt I use an overlapped and the problem is gone. But it seems to me that the two methods are identical in behavior since I use WaitForSingleObject which waits for the event io request to finish to trigger. p  pThe basic layout is the following. Note that following code is incomplete and there to show only the constructp  pSynchronousp  precodeWaitForIo      do          DeviceIoControlhDevice,ioctlcode, ..., NULL         do something after io request completed      while1     return  codepre  pAsynchronousp  precodeWaitForIo      do          Overlapped ov         CreateEvent         DeviceIoControlhDevice,ioctlcode, ..., ampov         WaitForSingleObject         do something after io request completed      while1  codepre  pwhy is the two methods behave differently Is there something wrong in my logicp

Negative 28949 pI have a listView that is populated buy a custom CursorAdapter. I have a button on each row, that when clicked, toggles a value in the database and changes the icon view. The listener for that button is added in the bindView method. The problem is, when this happens the cursor is not updated, so the next time the list is redrawn the keyboard pops up and goes away, or the list is scrolled and the icon reverts to the original view.

Negative 28949 pI have an issue with meeting XHTML Strict requirements for a class assignment. The class assignment says to use java script to generate a table, but only the array can be use in an external javascript file.

This could mean that you have incorrectly nested elements  such as a style element in the body section instead of inside head  or two elements that overlap which is not allowed.p      pOne common cause for this error is the use of XHTML syntax in HTML documents. Due to HTMLs rules of implicitly closed elements, this error can create cascading effects. For instance, using XHTMLs selfclosing tags for meta and link in the head section of a HTML document may cause the parser to infer the end of the head section and the beginning of the body section where link and meta are not allowed hence the reported error.p blockquote  pThe line that is generating this error isp  precodeltscript typetextjavascriptgt     lt     forvar i0 ilt5i         document.writelttrgtlttd classclassesgt         document.writeclassArray[i]         document.writelttdgtlttrgt          gt ltscriptgt codepre  pThe issue is this code is in the body tags.

Negative 28949 pI am trying to write a threaded application in Delphi 2010 using Indy. Both of these are new to me and I am struggling with synchronising the Vcl. I have read about synchronising with the Vcl, using Critical Sections, TThread.Synchronize, TIdNotify etc. I would like to see an example of how to use TIdnotify. In my case I am trying to update a TreeView from a thread. I have searched the groupsforums, but no success. Any examples would be very much appreciated. TIAp
Negative 28949 pI have an activity that sets a custom created view onCreated and a Thread is started, this thread cycles every 23ms and invalidates this view so its onDraw is called almost always.p  pThis view continues in screen until a user clicks on it onTouchEvent and view does some proceses and when ready a public flag ins enabled so the activity knows when the view was activated and has made its proceses, in this moment the activity should change its view to another one custom created, the problem is that because the flag checking is done in the run method of the thread the activity sends a CallFromWrongThreadException, this is because as far as I understand the changing is in another thread not UI.p  pI have set the runOnUiThread to overpass this and the srceen goes completly black.p  pAlso I have tried to set the activity to a framelayout in which I add both views at begging and the thread changes visibiliity of the views, no success at all.p
Negative 28949 pWhere I work, we are building a GUI to run on iOS or Android the GUI is intended to control an embedded board.  The embedded board does not have WiFi, an Ethernet port, or a USB port, but it does have an RS232 serial port so we are using a product called a WiSnap.p  pa hrefhttpserialio.comproductsmobilewifiWiSnapKit2.php relnofollowhttpserialio.comproductsmobilewifiWiSnapKit2.phpap  pWe have been able to connect to the WiSnap using OS X, or using iOS an iPad 2.  But none of our Android tablets recognize the device at all.  The WiSnap acts as a WiFi access point, and broadcasts an SSID the Android tablets do not list this SSID in the list of available WiFi access points.  Under Linux Mint 12, my Laptop can see the WiSnap, but attempts to connect to it fail.  Interestingly, my cell phone a Droid 2 emisem able to see the WiSnap, but I dont have telnet on my phone so I havent tested to see if it actually works.p  pUnder OS X, I noticed something.  In the dropdown list of WiFi access points, there are two distinct groups the top group, which contains most of the listed WiFi access points, then a lower group, that has a subheading that says Devices and contains just the WiSnap and something called hpsetup.  I dont know what hpsetup is or where it might be there are lots of WiFi users in this neighborhood.p  pThe WiSnap is operating in adhoc mode with no security at all.p  pSo, my question is what is the significance of OS X calling the WiSnap a device  It is frustrating to try to search Google for WiFi devices you get a giant haystack of results that are not related to this.p  pAlso, is there anything we can do to make an Android tablet see the WiSnap and connect to itp  pCan anyone recommend a good resource where I can read up on WiFi  Again Google hasnt helped much there are so many introductions to WiFi out there, most of them at a very simple level.p  pThanks for any help you can give me.p  pEDIT The vendor does claim Android compatibility for some models of WiSnap, but not for others.p  pThis lists Android as supported a hrefhttpserialio.comproductsmobilewifiWiSnapKit2.php relnofollowhttpserialio.comproductsmobilewifiWiSnapKit2.phpap  pThis does not a hrefhttpserialio.comproductsmobilewifiWiSnapAAA.php relnofollowhttpserialio.comproductsmobilewifiWiSnapAAA.phpap  pI guess I should contact the vendor, but I do want to emunderstandem what is going on, so I was hoping to get advice from the StackOverflow community about this.p  pEDIT We did contact the vendor.  What we found out is that the WiSnap can be a standalone device only in adhoc mode.  If you set up a WiFi router or access point, the WiSnap will join the network in infrastructure mode.  But the WiSnap will not act as an infrastructure mode access point.p  pAndroid OS at the moment only supports infrastructure mode.  So, if we want to use an Android tablet with a WiSnap we would have to set up some sort of WiFi router or access point.  We are looking into other solutions now.p

Negative 28949 pIm faced with an architecture decisions wich are quite tricky to solve. Im sorry in advance for a long post but before you can help me I have to give you a context.p  pMy company tries to integrate new architecture based around ASP.NET MVC framework into the existing ASP.NET legacy code. The hint is that we cant get rid of all the business code wich is encapsulated in the legacy assemblies but we have to wrap it into the new ones in order to make a sort of anticorruption layer and to decouple it. Were good until now, but here come one constraint the main that makes the decoupling a bit tricker  p  ol liIn the legacy ASP.NET web site, they used a kind of persistance aware model in order to enable lazy loading from views I know its crap. There is a reason for it. The code is so convulted and difficult to deploy that they wanted to give a possibility to designers to modify only views without deploying binaries. A God class is pushed into the view with properties that are lazy loaded if needed. So for example if a designer wants to modify a view to display another property he can just pick whetever he wants from the God class and it just works. strongWe have to keep the same behavior in the new MVC architecturestrong.li ol  pLets take an example. Lets say we have a codeItemcode stronglegacystrong persistance aware DTO p  precodepublic class Item     public string Title get set     public ListltUserCommentgt Comments get set   lazy loaded in the background in legacy code.  codepre  pSo the designer uses in the view can call a codeItem.Titlecode and deploy and after can add if he wants codeItem.Commentscode in foreach and deploy just the view without the need of deploying all the binaries.p  pThe following architecture has been proposed. A new POCOs for the mvc web site are located in the codeDomaincode assebmly which doesnt reference any other assembly. In this assembly we have also a definition of repositories interfaces like codeIItemRepositorycode. Entities are used directly in the ASP.NET MVC ViewModels and obtained through the Repository implementations that are wired up by the underlying DI container.p  pWe have another assebly where the implementations of IRepositories live. That assembly references all the legacy code that is used to populate the entities from the Domain.p  pUntill now all is great. But heres the tricky part. The entities from the domain assembly should comply with the constraint from the point 1 lazy load in the views.p  pSo our POCOs declare all the properties as Lazylt. Which allows us in the implementation assembly the one that references all the legacy code to define delegates that populate these properties when they are accessed. Heres the new implementation of POCOs for MVC  p  precodepublic class Item             public string Title get set         public LazyltListltUserCommentgtgt Comments get set   lazy loaded in the background in legacy code.      codepre  pAnd here is a ItemRepository implementation p  precodepublic class ItemRepository  IItemRepository      public Item GetItemint id               Item i  new Item  Id  id          i.Comments  new System.LazyltIEnumerableltUserCommentsgtgt  gt CommentsService.GetUserCommentsid          return i       codepre  pWe dont like it very much, and heres why  p  ul liPOCOs are not really POCO because it seems that there is a leaky abstraction of lifetime managment in the entities. This is not a big deal because Lazylt, is a type in .NET Framework. On the other hand if youre using an ORM like NHibernate you have to bend your POCOs in order to allow NHibernate to load the data sepcial constructor, virtual members, etc.li liThe other reason why we dont like it, is that it hides the underlying service composition in the repositories implementation. For example if codeItem.Commentscode is used, in the underlying implementation of the ItemRepository we will call to another legacy service CommentsService.GetUserCommentsid in that caseli ul  pstrongQuestion 1 strong Do you see other drawbacks in using Lazylt in the POCO implementation  Or other flaws in the design that we should consider p  pstrongQuestion 2 strong How can we avoid legacy service composition in the repository implementations in order to have a clear vision of which    legacy services are used  Besides, do we really need this vision    at the implementation level as we could consider repositories    implementation as faade to the legacy services p  pstrongQuestion 3 strong Are there any other alternatives with a respect to the constraint 1 lazy load p  pstrongQuestion 4 strong Are there any guidelines related to the composition for the lazy members p  pIm sorry for the long questions but would really appreciate your help.p  pThomasp
Negative 28949 pI have a simple LAMP website on AWS. I want at least 2 instances, that will connect to RDS, and Ill have a load balancer.  The simple question, not answered on the web is Where do you put the shared user uploaded files like the imagesp  pNFS should be one answer. I mean,something like create another instance, sharing a folder through NFS and the other instances mount them. But it is a failure point. p  pRsync folders between instances p  pThe best answer I found is to use s3fs, and mount an s3 bucket on all my instances. But I dont like to use things not supported by Amazon. p  pWhat is the right solutionp  pThanksp  pstrongSOLUTIONstrongp  pI tried s3fs but I experienced many issues ie with Eventual Consistency. p  pSo, finally I implemented the AWS SDK and used the S3 library to upload directly to S3.  Then pointed a domain to the s3 bucket directly.p  pThanks to allp

Negative 28949 pI have been trying to do a GUI test with DUnit which includes interacting with modal windows via a message loop timer system by tomazy see my earlier question for more details a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9411840howcaniusefuturewindowswithstandardfileopendialogs94280799428079How Can I use FutureWindows with standard file open dialogsa .p  pMy solution in the other question works fine when I run the tests manually, but when I run this within a continuous build system in TeamCity, it hangs when the dialogs OK message should be handled. The service that runs the tests has the permission interact with desktop set, and I have verified that the hanging happens ONLY if the OK is pressed i.e. the CDNFILEOK notification happens. I can close the dialog using WMCLOSE, but this naturally does not cause the dialog to return an OK modal result, and thus is not usable.p  pIf I cant get this to work, Ill probably have to modify the production code target of test to publish an event to give the filename and have the test hook into it and give it without a dialog, but Id like to know what is causing this problem and preferably of course solve it without modifying the production code.p
Negative 28949 pI have a asp .net web pageMVC displaying 10,000 products.p  pFor this I am using a method. In that method I have to call an external web service 20 times. This is because the web service gives me 500 data at a time, so to get 10000 data I need to call the service 20 times.p  p20 calls makes the page load slow. Now I need to increase the performance. Since web service is external I cannot make changes there.p  pThreading is an option I thought of. Since I can use page numbers service is paging for the data each service call is almost independent.p  pAnother option is using parallel linq.p  pShould I use parallel linq, or choose threadingp  pSomeone please guide me here. Or let me know another way to achieve this.p  pNote  this web page can be used by many users at a time.p  pWe have filters left side of the page.for that we need all the 10,000 data to construct filter.Otherwise pagewise info could have been enough.and caching is not possible since the huge overload on the server. at a time 4001000 users can hit server.web service response time is 10 second so that we can hit them many timep  pWe have to hit the service 20 times to get all data.Now i need a solution to improve that hit.Is threading is the only optionp

Negative 28949 pIn Photoshop you can set a layers blending mode to be Hue. If that layer is, for example, filled with blue then it seems to take the layer below and makes it all blue wherever a nonwhiteish color exists.p  pIm wondering what its actually doing though. If I have a background layer with a pixel aarrggbb and the layer on top of that is set to blend mode Hue and theres a pixel aarrggbb on that layer, how are those two values combined to give the result that we seep  pIt doesnt just drop the rrggbb from the layer below. If it did that itd color white and black as well. It also wouldnt allow color variations through.p  pIf a background pixel is 0xff00ff00 and the corresponding hue layer pixel is 0xff0000ff then Im assuming the end result will just be 0xff0000ff because the ff blue replaces the ff green. But, if the background pixel is 0x55112233 and the hue layer pixel is 0xff0000ff, how does it come up with the shade of blue that it comes up withp  pThe reason I ask is that Id like to take various images and change the hue of the image programmatically in my app. Rather than storing 8 different versions of the same image with different colors, Id like to store one image and color it as needed.p

Negative 28949 pI have clientserver application where the client app will open files. Those files get split in chunks, and sent to the server.p  pNot only does the client send file chunks, but it sends other data as well. Each message data or filechunk has a priority level.p  pstrongAll messages get buffered and written to the TCP stream according to their priority. Currently input and output streams get closed on both sides clientserver whenever a file is fully sent or received. This means that the streams remain open for as long as it takes to send the files.strongp  pThe TCP connection is allowed to fail, as it will reconnect and message sending will be resumed, therefore, the streams will be closed at some point.p  pstrongBUT if and when the JVM would be killed for example, the streams will not be cleaned up.strongp  pMy first thought on solving this was to add cleanup code in the finalizers, but I understand these may not run when the JVM gets killed or if System.exit is called.p  pMy second thought is to rewrite part of the application and have only use the streams for as long as it takes to readwrite one chunk. Therefore, I would end up openingclosing the files for as many times as there are chunks. This method has the advantage of allowing me to use trycatchfinally constructs, but I have the gut feeling openening and closing the files this often implies a fair bit of overhead.p  pstrongSo how does one clean up resources when the design doesnt allow for emfinallyem blocks Or should such a design be avoided, maybe in a way similar to what I describedstrongp  pIm also concerned about possibly having as many files open as there are priorities which in theory are unlimited.p  pMost files will typically be a few KiBs big, but in some cases they may get as big as several GB.p  pThanks in advance for your input.p  pEDIT Added imagep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comFJnnU.jpg altFile transfer as it isp

Negative 28949 pIm having trouble adding a reference to an HTTPS web service using Visual Studio 2008, it works fine in Visual Studio 2010 but in VS2008 I get the below error.p  pOur IT guys tell me that the problem is that VS2008 is not using the IE proxy settings properly so the HTTPS request is getting sent to the HTTP proxy, which always denies all HTTPS requests. However, in VS2010 it works just fine.p  pThey dont know how to fix this if that is indeed the problem.p  pAs an aside, I have to use VS2008 because I want to use this in an SSIS Script Task, however Ive been testing this in a blank console app.p  pThere was an error downloading httpsxxxxxxxxxxxx.asmx. The operation has timed out Metadata contains a reference that cannot be resolved httpsxxxxxxxxxxxxx.asmx. An error occurred while making the HTTP request to a hrefhttpsxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.asmx relnofollowhttpsxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.asmxa. This could be due to the fact that the server certificate is not configured properly with HTTP.SYS in the HTTPS case. This could also be caused by a mismatch of the security binding between the client and the server. The underlying connection was closed An unexpected error occurred on a send. Unable to read data from the transport connection An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host. An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host If the service is defined in the current solution, try building the solution and adding the service reference again.p

Negative 28949 pI have used MVC to create several sites from scratch, but now I am tasked with a migration project.p  pCurrently the site has a large static file base .html. Eventually every page will be migrated to MVC with views and controllers. The site lends itself to conversion very well with few nested folders and each folder with several pages. This should be a fairly straight forward job. But business dictates this must be done incrementally folder by folder, this is OK as each folder is fairly self contained and very few links go to other folders.p  pMy question is can I just import the entire existing site into a folder named codelegacyhtmlcode in my VS project then configure routing to essentially ignore this folder, preserving the current site navigation for users.p  pAs I migrate each folder, the folder would be deleted from legacyhtml and controller and views be created.p  pThe reason I ask is there are many root level folders and given eventually they will be all be migrated to controllers and views, I dont want them cluttering the project and getting in my way.

And the jpeg image has dimensions of 200x200 pixels. As far as I understand, the jpeg image should be viewed in the codeUIImageViewcode without any scaling. I read the jpeg image asp  precodeNSString docDir  [NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomainsNSDocumentDirectory, NSUserDomainMask, YES objectAtIndex0]             NSString jpegFilePath  [NSString stringWithFormatimdd.jpeg,docDir, dbPhotoId, i] UIImage tmpImage  [UIImage imageWithContentsOfFile[NSString stringWithFormat, jpegFilePath]] codepre  pthe codeUIImage tmpImagecode has a scale factor of 1 and width and height of 200 and 200 observed from codetmpImage.scalecode, codetmpImage.size.widthcode and codetmpImage.size.heightcode. p  pIn this case, if I set the image property of the codeUIImageViewcode with dimensions 100x100 points as the codetmpImagecode, can I safely assume that there wont be any scaling or retina display problems p

There is codeTask.Factory.StartNewcode codeParallel.Forcode codeParallel.ForEachcode etc. p  pWhat I am going to do is post to a website and fetch the responses for about 200 URLs.p  pWhen I use codeParallel.ForEachcode I didnt find a way to control the number of threads and the application went using 130 threads and the website went unresponsive p  pI am interested in using codeTask.Factory.StartNewcode within a for loop and divide the URLs in to 4 or 5 tasks.p  precodeListltTaskgt tasks  new ListltTaskgt for int i  0 i lt 5 i      Listltstringgt UrlForTask  GetUrlsForTaski,5 Lets say will return some thing like 1 of 5 of the list of URLs     int j  i     var t  Task.Factory.StartNew gt              ListltPageSummarygt t  GetSummaryUrlForTask         Summary.AddRanget Summary is a public variable          tasks.Addt  codepre  pI believe that these Tasks kind of boil down to threads.

Negative 28949 pI finally have a strongverystrong basic version of my graph searcher working through a CLI, but I find myself in a position where I need to refactor all of the code.  Since I am doing this programming on a mac, I was thinking of using Cocoa for the GUI, and then having my C functions underneath as workhorses.  This would just be a temporary fix, as eventually I want to be able to run all of my code on a linux boxcluster.  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions15032773correlationnetworkimplementation titleHereHerea is my last question about the implementation, and I did get this working in boost, rolling my own graph functions for now.p  pSo here was my thought Build the C classes for the graph itself, and either separate functions or methods for the quantities I want to compute.  a hrefhttprobnapier.netblogwrappingcppfinaledition759 relnofollowThisa is the latest description that I can find that deals with mixing ObjectiveC and C.  But I was wonderingp  pWill compiling my C code in Xcode be optimized  The whole point is that I want the C code to be fully optimized for fast memory access, multiple threads, and have access to the boost libraries.  Then, I can encapsulate the C class in a wrapping ObjectiveC class.  To do this, I would essentially have 2 classes, correct  The C class with a .h and .cpp file and included boost libraries, and then the ObjC class wrapper with a .h and .mm file, where the .h does not contain any reference to the C class, I use the include in the .mm file.  Then I can use my normal MVC design and GUI implementation for Objective C.  As long as I give the dealloc command the ability to nuke the C class, I dont have to worry about memory management  Does ARC work well with C as well, and does it give OSX the ability to memory manage and clean up my C codep  pI suspect that if I want threading, I would go with the boost threading, since coding for the GCD would make it platform specific although for now, this is all it will run on.  I think that for now, I will stay away from the Core Data, since I create my graph by simply parsing a text file.p

I think it should be eitherp  precodefind[],,. codepre  pbecause I guess that the last recursive call wouldnt have anything to start with, orp  precodefind,[],. codepre  passuming that the list of the terms defining adjacent nodes should be empty when the program finished processing it.p  pNow the actual call. Probably something likep  precodefindStart,[rStart,[AdjacentRestadj]Rest],Path            find. codepre  pMy problems here are the followingp  pHow do I make the program use the members of the list in the r... term as the next   Startp  pHow do I check if a node has already been visited How can I remove a node from a specific list in rp  pHow do I put the found nodes into the Path list Simply append Or execute the recursive call with something like [PathStart]p  pAs you see, its not much. Some suggestive questions would be nice, since Prolog seems quite interesting and therefore fun to learn...p  hr  pAfter spending some time with the neat PDTEclipse trace tool, I think I understood what the program is doing. What I dontt get at this point is why the last node always gets lost. After backtracking fails, for example because rc,[b] is the next found term and memberchkb,[b] fails because of the negationthats what I thing  does and no other term with rc,X can be found, it starts over with looking for other possibilities to go from node b, which has adjacent nodes left in rb,[...]. But why does the program forget to put node c into the Path list Is there a possibility to do some kind of ifthenelse in case p  precode memberrNode, Adjacent, Graph, memberAdjNode, Adjacent,  memberchkAdjNode, Seen, codepre  pfails, to still append the last node to Pathp
Negative 28949 pIs there a preexisting, best practices project skeleton for Chef  Django web applications on Linux Ubuntu preferablyp  pFor production Django systems our preferred setup is Supervisor, Nginx, Ubuntu and Uwsgi. Additionally we use Chef to do configuration management and Vagrant  Chef to do development environment management.p  pWhile this system is great once theyre all up and running they can be very time consuming to setup properly. p  pMy ideal solution would be premade Chef Github repository which was a skeleton for a bestpractices Django deployment. It would come with a codechefsolo.rbcode ready to be used to deploy to some cloud ubuntu instance and a codeVagrantfilecode ready to be used to create Vagrant dev machine. Basically all you would have to do is add a Chef cookbook to deploy your application  code and tweak a few settings.p  pDoes anything like that ideal solution existp

Negative 28949 pI am having trouble using shared memory, semaphores and forks in Unix C. My semaphores are not posix.  I create a pointer to shared memory 2sizeoffloat. I initialize the value of my semaphore to 2 with semctl. I do a fork in a for loop ilt2.  In the child processes if fork  0 each child does a p operation on the semaphore 1, writes to shared memory then does a v operation 1 then exits. The Parent process does a p operation 2 on the semaphore, reads the entirety of the shared memory segmentwith a for loop and does a v operation 2. He waits on the child processes before exiting to avoid zombies. The problem i have in output is that i get  p  precode Parent reading 0  Parent reading 1  Parent reading 0  Parent reading 1  Child writing 0  Child writing 1 codepre  pWhen what i should be getting is p  precode Child writing 0  Child writing 1  Parent reading 0  Parent reading 1 codepre  pI have tried initializing my semaphore to 1 instead of 2 but that just stalls the program since the semaphore will never have a value of two and thus the parent process will never read.p  pIf what i have understood about semaphores is correct, the fact that i initialize it to 2 means that the parent process can directly read even though none of the children have written anything.

Negative 28949 pI have a PHP script that authenticates users using the client certificate. Apache is configured to require an SSL connection for that script, and its working fine.p  pHowever, I also want requests to the authentication script to be redirected to another file if that file is present. Im using modrewrite for this, and the redirection also works fine if the other file is present, but if its not, then the auth script is no longer able to see the client certificate.p  pExample PHP script ssltest.phpp  precodeltpregt ltphp vardumpSERVER[SSLCLIENTVERIFY] echo n vardumpSERVER[SSLCLIENTCERT] gt ltpregt codepre  p.htaccessp  precodeltIfModule modssl.cgt     ltFiles ssltest.phpgt         SSLVerifyClient optional         SSLVerifyDepth 2         SSLOptions StdEnvVars ExportCertData OptRenegotiate     ltFilesgt ltIfModulegt codepre  pAt this point, if I navigate to ssltest.php, it displays the client certificate and codeSSLCLIENTVERIFYcode contains SUCCESS.p  pNow I add the following to .htaccessp  precodeRewriteCond REQUESTURI ssltest.php [NC] RewriteCond foo.html F RewriteRule . foo.html [L] codepre  pIf foo.html is present, then requests to ssltest.php are redirected, so that part is working. However, if foo.html is emnotem present, then ssltest.php fails to get the client cert  codeSSLCLIENTCERTcode is empty and codeSSLCLIENTVERIFYcode contains NONE.p  pThis seems to happen whenever ssltest.php matches the first RewriteCond directive, regardless of whether it contains the actual filename or a regular expression that matches multiple filenames. If I remove the rewrite logic or change the regular expression so it no longer matches ssltest.php, it starts working again.p  pWhats the problem Im probably overlooking something simple, but Ive been going over the docs for both modrewrite and modssl and cant find anything that would explain this behaviour.p  pJust to clarify, I dont need the cert to be redirected to foo.html, thats just a static page. I need ssltest.php to be redirected to foo.html if foo.html exists, and to be able to read the client cert if it doesnt. Right now I can do one or the other, but not both.p

Negative 28949 pI have an unusual problem thats driving me crazy I havent found a question posted yet that pertains to this exact issue. p  pI have a page on my site where certain elements render incorrectly on random page loads. Using chrome for example, the page will render normally but after a number of refreshes a basic ul in the header will shift down into the body. Sometimes a carousel wont appear, or a navigation block will slide to the next row. I have duplicated this behavior on Firefox as well. p  pI cant really give a snippet of code for anyone to look at because I have no idea where the issue is originating from. The page with the issue is the index of www.Calibrus.com. Whats really amazing is that by using Chrome Dev Tools I can set displaynone to the incorrect ul, then set display back to normal, and the ul renders where it should again. This suggests to me that the exact same html and css is somehow rendering differently regardless of any scripts being used.p  pAlso, this isnt an issue with the server. I have the same problem when running the code locally.p  pDoes anyone have any idea whats going on herep

Negative 28949 pIm familiar with cURL loading a single webpage, but in this case, I need two URLs loaded about 3 times in a specific order. I dont know what is the best and cleanest way to handle multiple cURL calls, are there any tips and tricks for thisp  pFor example cURL first calls file1.php, once it has COMPLETELY finished loading important, it will call file2.php.p  pThis process needs to be repeated about 3 times. I was thinking of putting the process above inside a loop, however just like in the process, the files may not be called yet when the previous is not finished loading yet. I prefer to even have a little sleep between them. It is really important that the files are loaded in a specific order each time.p  pCan anybody whos experienced with cURL point me towards the right position I honestly have no idea where to start.p

Negative 28949 pI have configured free text search on a table in my postgres database. Pretty simple stuff, with firstname, lastname and email. This works well and is fast.p  pI do however sometimes experience looong delays when inserting a new entry into the table, where the insert keeps running for minutes and also generates huge WAL files. We use the WAL files for replication.p  pIs there anything I need to be aware of with my free text index Like Postgres maybe randomly restructuring it for performance reasons My index is currently around 400 MB big.p  pThanks in advancep  pChristianp

Negative 28949 pFirstly Im coding in c and running in LinuxCentOS 6.4p  pSo after a really long time and reading a lot of different books on sockets, I finally have at least my client and my server partially working. p  pFirst I want to continuously accept messages from different clients, I have already setup the client, and it finally successfully compiled at least. Now I need to set up my server so that I can properly test. p  pWhat Im doing is implementing the dining philosopher problem with sockets, with each clientphilosopher representing a different process. I was going to go through this whole thing, where the server was going to keep track of everything, like the states of all the client. That was too difficult, I have now just created the client just to send their status to the server and the server prints it out. p  pI was thinking of putting a dowhile loop to continuously accept messages, but not sure what I should use to stop the loop.

Negative 28949 pI have a fragment with 4 buttons. I want to save each buttons position on screen in a hashmap each button will be mapped to its position on screen.

With fragments I tried to use ViewTreeObserver with GlobalLayoutListener. Inside the anonymous class I can retrieve and save in instance variable the button position but outside of it these values are gone equal 0.

For that I need to have all buttons positions so to be able to identify moving from one button to another in onTouch method.

Negative 28949 pI am having a problem with a div wrapping underneath the left div it is side by side with, I want the div to get narrower until it is side by side with the menubar, and then stop moving but not wrap. p  pI have two divs side by side, the div on the left is a menu bar, and the one on the right is a div used to enter content on the site. The div on the left is set to take 16 of the width, and the one on the right is set to take 86 of the width. When I make the browser window narrower it resizes getting more narrow, until the mainpage div wraps underneath the menubar div.

Negative 28949 pi know that regex is not good for parsing html, however this is only a single line string that is imputed to a function. for example, codeltfont color  ff0000gt hello ltfontgtcode. now for the regex i would like to have it match if it is correctly closed, i found that doing codeltfont.ltfontgtcode is close but does not handle everything. for example if the input was codeltfont color  ff0000gt hello ltdivgtcode it would say that it was incorrect. but if it was codeltfont color  ff0000gt hello ltfontgtltfontgtcode it would say that it was correct and would not catch the error. so the question is, what would be a good pattern to check for unclosed font tags on a single string and i am using python but a JavaScript method would work as well p

Negative 28949 pI have a design problem which has been plaguing me for quite some time now. Essentially I have a function which takes long time to execute and a gui which needs to be responsive and uptodate. When the user hits a start button the long function begins executing in a while loop and after each execution the gui needs to be updated.p  pI was thinking the best way of doing this was to have a QThread run in a while loop and if the user pressed a start button the long function would begin executing. similar to the followingp  precodeclass Application  public QThread      void run void              while mExiting                      if StartPressed                 LongFunction               Need to update gui before              running long function again                codepre  pI tried doing QMetaObjectInvoke with BlockingQueuedConnection however, when the gui application quits, the thread gets stuck and never exits. I also tried using a QMutex however, the gui would become locked waiting for the mutex which is locked and in use by the long function.p  pI was thinking, is there any way to cancel BlockingQueuedConnection when the application wants to quit or is there some other way of implementing this.p
Negative 28949 pIm working on designing a pattern where there will be multiple subjects and multiple observers. Each observer will register itself to the subjects that it needs to in its constructor, as it knows what it needs to know to produce its output. My first thought was to make the subjects a singleton class, but I found that would either require making each subject a singleton individually, or an codeabstract staticcode class that Java does not support. Bottom line is, Im trying to figure out what the best solution really is. Just to make sure its really clear, heres what Im trying to dop  ol liThere will be multiple subjects. Each observer will have the ability to observe multiple subjects. In order to make this work, Im going to have a resource code for each subject such that it will identify itself to the Observer updateSUBJECT1 where SUBJECT1 is the int that corresponds to Subject 1li liEach observer will know which subjects it wants to observe at construction.li liI only want a single instance of each subject created.li liSome observers might in turn be subjects themselves. li liIn general, there is a flow pattern. There is ultimately a few sources of input, which create more abstract concepts. My flow diagram of observersubject looks something like thisli ol  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comQoxig.png altenter image description herep  pIm thinking this might call for another design pattern entirely, but as Im still fairly new to design patterns in general, I thought Id ask for a bit more experience before I jump in. Thanksp  pJust to be clear, the singleton comes in to play as follows, namely that I want an abstractSubject, where every subject is a Singleton. While I could make each a singleton of its own accord, Id rather be forced to make all use a getInstance, something like this psuedocode.p  precodeabstract class abstractSubject  AbstractSubject instancenull  public static AbstractSubject getInstance      if instancenull         instancenew AbstractInstance     return instance  abstract void attach More stuff will go here to make it a subject   Define Subject1, Subject2 classes fully  class Observer1 extends AbstractObserver      public Observer1              Subject1.getInstance.attachthis         Subject2.getInstance.attachthis          Other stuff goes here to make it an observer  codepre

Negative 28949 pThis is my first time posting here so I hope I will be coherent and provide all the required info for you folks to understand my point.p  pInside my company we use a make based build, in all projects. Different versions of compilers are used from one project to another but I guess this is not an issue.p  p My goal is somehow to implement first of all a solution that will reduce build times not by using the j option by a factor at 3 for example. The resources to accomplish this to be the CPUs of the other computers in the network around 200 PC all multicore CPUs.p  pAfter this to create some nightly builds, and other reporting and automation but I think with Jenkins should be no issue.p  pProjects at this point built on a computer last form 15min to 180min for a clean build. Also all the source file and make process all the information is stored in a SCM systemp  pSo my question to you   do you have an idea of what software to use to accelerate builds opensource would be the way to go for me so that implementation costs should be minimal. I know about incredibuild and openmake master, Electric Accelerator  but all of the cost, and the 2 open source alternatives from SUSE and the other that I cant remember now  I seen only support gccp  ul lito automate builds Jenkins is the way I think I should go. Do you agree with this Do you have other solutionsli ul  pThank you allp

The array elements are initialized asp  precodemyString[index]  mallocstrlenword myString[index]  word codepre  pand Im calling a function like thisp  pcodefreememorymyStrings, sizecode where size is the length of the array I know this is not the problem, I tested it extensively and everything except this function is working.p  pcodefreememorycode looks like thisp  precodevoid freememorychar list, int size       for int i  0 i lt size i           freelist[i]           freelist  codepre  pNow here comes the weird part. codeif sizegt strlenlist[i]code then the program crashes. For example, imagine that I have a list of strings that looks something like thisp  precodemyStrings[0]  Some myStrings[1]  random myStrings[2]  strings codepre  pAnd thus the length of this array is code3code.p  pIf I pass this to my codefreememorycode function, codestrlenmyStrings[0] gt 3code strong4  3strong, and the program crashes.p  pHowever, if I change codemyStrings[0]code to be codeSocode instead, then codestrlenmyStrings[0] lt 3code strong2 lt 3strong and the program does emnotem crash.p  pSo it seems to me that codefreelist[i]code is actually going through the codechar[]code that is at that location and trying to free each character, which I emimagineem is strongundefined behaviorstrong.p  pThe only reason I say this is because I can play around with the size of the first element of codemyStringscode and make the program crash whenever I feel like it, so Im assuming that this is the problem area.p  pstrongNotestrong I emdidem try to debug this by stepping through the function that calls codefreememorycode, noting any weird values and such, but the moment I step into the codefreememorycode function, the debugger crashes, so Im not really sure what is going on. Nothing is out of the ordinary until I enter the function, then the world explodes.p  pstrongAnother notestrong I also posted the shortened version of the source for this program not too long Pastebin a hrefhttppastebin.comvFr2tZDi relnofollowherea. I am compiling on MinGW with the c99 flag on.p  pstrongPSstrong  I just thought of this. I am indeed passing codenumUniqueWordscode to the free function, and I know that this does not actually free the entire piece of memory that I allocated. Ive called it both ways, thats not the issue. And I left it how I did because that is the way that I will be calling it after I get it to work in the first place, I need to revise some of my logic in that function.p  pstrongSource, as per request onsitestrongp  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt include ltstring.hgt include ltctype.hgt include ltstdlib.hgt include words.h  int getNumUniqueWordschar text[], int size  int mainint argc, char argv[]           setvbufstdout, NULL, 4, IONBF  For Eclipse... stupid bug. gt does NOT affect the program, just the output to console          int nbrwords          char text[]  Some  text, a stdin.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.p  pThanks for replying, I should have been a bit clearer.p  pI need to know that rows 1,2,3 have four field values in common The As and Bs and that rows 3,4,5 have four field values in common, then either update a field in that table to record this so for example write group1 to a field for rows 1,2,3 and the same for rows 3,4,5 but when a row is in two groups it might be best to write to another table and add a row to record the matchesp  pI have full control of the schema so can do what I need to.p  pSo I dont need to know the number of matches for each row, but record the groups if you like in which all members of the group have four fields in common.p  pthanks again CMp

Negative 28949 pMy site consists of a side menu div and a main content div. Ive floated the divs left and used percentages so that the columns fill the entire page. However Im also using minwidths because I want the side menu to be no smaller than 205px wide and the main content to be no smaller than 780px. The site needs to be no smaller than 985px wide however I still want the content to be flexible enough to fill the screen.p  pMy problem is when I resize the window less than 985px wide the main content div moves underneath the side menu. Where am I going wrong, The div should stay in the same position, next to the side menu, but the horizontal scroll bar should kick in.

Negative 28949 pSo Ive been researching for days now on how to filter a rowsource result on a control in a way that is comfortable, hopefully you understand what I mean by that as I explain. I have found solutions, a bunch of solutions. Im more concerned with evaluating their benefits and negatives.p  pI have a specific example, but my concern is really more generic. This, to me, seems like the backbone of my application and so I want to make sure its being done correctly, the best way, not just in a way that works.p  pBasically, I have progressive combo box filters. The first box filters the second box, which then selects a record in a Single Form view. The two combo boxes are in the header of the form.p  pLets say I have a table CanadianCities. The two combo boxes might be, cboProvinceFilter Filter by Province, and cboCitySelect Select Cityp  pWhen I load the form the province filter is off, so the cities list is populated with a rowsource that selects ALL the cities SELECT ID, CityName FROM CanadianCities. But thats a big list, so I have the second combo box to narrow that list down by province SELECT ID, ProvinceName FROM CanadianProvinces.p  pSo the goal is that on cboProvinceFilter.AfterUpdate to requery cboCitySelect with an altered where clause [...] WHERE ProvinceID  [cboProvinceFilter].p  pThe problem is in how to alter the where clause. Ideally, the above would work right in the designer, but SQL designs seem to be out of the forms scope so cboProvinceFilter doesnt exist there. I agree with the opinion that direct referencing forms is bad. I dont want to marry my sql to the form like that. Plus, I want to use a navigation form, but also have a mobile option, so running the forms individually AND in navigation would be ideal, absolute referencing cant do this.p  pHaving my repetitious SQL statements buried in code feels like poor design, and repeating the same queries with slightly different filtering is terrible when Parameters are exactly for that reason.p  pAnd some will scoff at this, but it also feels bad to rewrite the functionality of the Access designer in VBA. If I build my own SQL, execute my own queries, and populate my own lists, why did Microsoft put all the effort into building this productivity assisting tool for Filtering is not exactly an obscure feature of database management... I feel like there must be a reasonable way to do this sort of thing.p  pAlso, popup forms are obnoxious, so I wont be making specific forms just to have reliable absolute references. That definitely feels like a copout.p  pSolutions that do feel good but I havent made work...p  pstrongSQL Parametersstrong The most sensible way of doing this I feel should be with SQL Parameters, as thats what theyre intended for right The QueryDef would store values for its parameters that could I could change as needed. However, I would let the queries execute naturally on requery.p  pSo instead of writing the handful of lines to execute the Query and populate the control, Id just set the parameter values and call requery on my control, which has all that functionality built into it.p  pSo defined some parameters in the SQL statement, then tried to set the values of those parameters in VBA before the Query was executed, but JET always seems to popup for the parameters if it doesnt reference an actual object, it wasnt checking my codeset querydefs.p  pFor that to work, it seems that Id have to execute the SQL manually, and parse my own recordset, and populate the control. Which feels like an excessive amount of repetition for every filter option Id want to offer.p  pstrongRelative Referencingstrong I dont mind referencing forms as long as its a relative path. Unfortunately [Screen].[ActiveForm] refers to the navigation form, not the actual, active form... So that seems to be out.p  pRight now Im thinking my only option is to set rowsource manually then call the controls requery. thats the less offensive feeling option. Might be best to take the current query and string replace the where portion, so i dont have to update every event if the query structure changes.p  pstrongFinal Thoughtstrong Anyway, this is getting ranty, so let me know your thoughts. Im not really looking for code solutions, which is why I offered few to no hard examples. Im looking for a paradigm for managing this kind of filtering that isnt too restrictive absolute referencing or too repetitivewheelreinventing hard coded sql, executing, control populating.p

Negative 28949 pIn a WinForms application I run several BackgroundWorkers to send bulk email. No, its not spam, its corporate email.p  pFrom time to time, a strongSmtpException Failure sending mailstrong happens when sending the email. This SmtpException is thrown inside a trycatch and written in a log. However, when this exception in particular happens, it takes about 5 minutes to write the exception to the log and continue, after which every email fails with the same exception and it takes about 5 minutes for it to handle each failed email.p  pFrom my research Ive read that a BackgroundWorker stops when an unhandled exception is thrown in debug mode. However, Ive ran the project with debug and release configurations, and the behavior is the same. strongEven when in debug mode, the BackgroundWorker stops for a long time without the debugger popping up any exception message.strongp  pAlso note that this bug is difficult to reproduce, as the first SmtpException with message Failure sending mail is thrown when it has sent between 300800 emails, at seemingly random points.p  pFor logging Im just using Trace from System.Diagnostics, so I dont think thats the problem.p  pEDIT I should also add that in some rare occasions, when SmtpException with message Failure sending mail, the BackgroundWorker stops going through the emails completely. I let it hang there just for the hell of it and after 1 hour or so it continued sending emails like nothing happened.p  pHeres the code of DoWorkp  precodeprivate void senderDoWorkobject sender, DoWorkEventArgs e      BackgroundWorker worker  sender as BackgroundWorker     SalaryEmail[] emails  e.Argument as SalaryEmail[]      SmtpClient smtpClient  new SmtpClientsmtp.office365.com, 587     smtpClient.EnableSsl  true     smtpClient.Credentials  new NetworkCredentialSalaryEmail.SmtpCredentials.User, SalaryEmail.SmtpCredentials.Password      foreach SalaryEmail email in emails              if worker.CancellationPending  true                      e.Cancel  true             break                  else                       Sending and database operations here             email.Sendref smtpClient               In this case I only report progress to a progressBar with previously set steps, so the number is irrelevant             worker.ReportProgress0                    smtpClient.Dispose  codepre  pHeres SalaryEmail.Sendp  precodepublic bool Sendref SmtpClient smtpClient      bool sent  false      for int i  0 i lt MAXATTEMPTS i              try                       Mail is a System.Net.Mail.MailMessage nonstatic property created and configured previously within the class             smtpClient.SendMail              sent  true                  catch SmtpException smtpEx                      Trace.WriteLineDateTime.Now   Intento   i   SmtpException   smtpEx.Message                  catch Exception ex                      Trace.WriteLineDateTime.Now   Intento   i   Error al enviar   ex.Message                    Update database         if sent                      try                              Database.MarkAsSentQna, RFC                          catch Exception e                              Trace.WriteLineDateTime.Now   Error al marcar enviados  e.Message                           break                    return sent  codepre  pException detailp  precodeA first chance exception of type System.Net.Mail.SmtpException occurred in System.dll 02012014 125725 Intento 0 SmtpException System.Net.Mail.SmtpException Error al enviar correo. gt System.Net.WebException Se excedi el tiempo de espera de la operacin.    en System.Net.ConnectionPool.GetObject owningObject, Int32 result, Booleanamp continueLoop, WaitHandle[]amp waitHandles    en System.Net.ConnectionPool.GetConnectionObject owningObject, GeneralAsyncDelegate asyncCallback, Int32 creationTimeout    en System.Net.Mail.SmtpConnection.GetConnectionServicePoint servicePoint    en System.Net.Mail.SmtpTransport.GetConnectionServicePoint servicePoint    en System.Net.Mail.SmtpClient.GetConnection    en System.Net.Mail.SmtpClient.SendMailMessage message     Fin del seguimiento de la pila de la excepcin interna     en System.Net.Mail.SmtpClient.SendMailMessage message    en MailingClient.SalaryEmail.SendSmtpClientamp smtpClient en CUsersmriveraDocumentsVisual Studio 2010ProjectsPayrollMailingMailingClientSalaryEmail.cslnea 62 codepre  pTracep  precode02012014 14456 Sending email... 02012014 14501 Updating database... 02012014 14501 Sending email... 02012014 14506 Updating database... 02012014 14507 Sending email... 02012014 14511 Updating database... 02012014 14511 Sending email... ltexception posted above heregt The thread ltNo Namegt 0x1890 has exited with code 0 0x0.

Clearly, since codeIFoocode doesnt have that property, its going to error.  However, if I change they type of codeTFOOcode to codeIFooltTgtcode, then I have to define it and codeLayerThreecode asp  precodeabstract class LayerTwoltTFOO, Tgt  LayerOneltTFOO, Bargt where TFOO  IFooltTgt, new      protected TFOO foo  new TFOO     public void Test1  foo.Data.Dump   class LayerThree  LayerTwoltFoo, intgt       public void Test2  foo.Data.Dump  codepre  pBut the intent of the concrete codeFoocode implementation is that it emalready knowsem its implementing codeIFooltintgtcode.  strongIs there any way I can get codeLayerTwocode to know about the codeDatacode property without requiring it to be looked up from codeFoocode and added to codeLayerThreecodes definitionstrongp  pWhat Id love isp  precodeclass LayerThree  LayerTwoltFoogt  Automatically realizes that the second generic is int      public void Test2  foo.Data.Dump  codepre  hr  pstrongUpdatestrong As it turns out, I was actually trying to implement two contradictory things in my code. The actual codeLayerTwocode was trying to keep codeTFOOcode generic, but also created an abstract method which required a specific type from codeIFooltTgtcode.br So the solution Im going with is just to use an interface which inherits from codeIFooltTgtcode and specifies the type, but Im accepting Ondrej Tucnys answer, since it emdidem solve the problem I asked about.p

Negative 28949 pIn my Qt Application Im facing the following scenario When a specific event is raised I show a modeless codeQDialogcode which asks the user for a confirmation. The Dialog is showed using codeshowcode function from a codeQMainWindowcode. Anytime the event is raised and no other modal codeQDialogcode are shown, the user is able to click the confirmation button. Unfortunately if a modal codeQDialogcode is visible when the event is raised, the modeless codeQDialogcode is unaccessible. This means that the user cannot click the confirmation button. The following code is a simplified version that causes the same problem In this example the codeQMainWindowcode contains a button, when the button is clicked a modal codeQDialogcode is shown using the codeexeccode function in the meanwhile a codeQTimercode has been started. Anytime I close the modal codeQDialogcode before the codeQTimercode is elapsed the modeless dialog is accesible. If I wait until the modeless dialog is shown without closing the modal one, the modeless dialog is inaccessible I need to close the modal one first.p  pMainWindows codep  precodeinclude mainwindow.h include uimainwindow.h  MainWindowMainWindowQWidget parent      QMainWindowparent,     uinew UiMainWindow      uigtsetupUithis     mpModeless  new DialogModalthis     connectampmqTimer,SIGNALtimeout,this,SLOTTimerElapsed    MainWindowMainWindow      delete mpModeless     delete ui    void MainWindowTimerElapsed      mqTimer.stop     mpModelessgtshow     mpModelessgtactivateWindow     mpModelessgtraise     mpModelessgtsetFocus   void MainWindowonpbStartTestclicked      mqTimer.start10000     DialogModal dthis     d.exec  codepre  pMainWindow Headerp  precodeifndef MAINWINDOWH define MAINWINDOWH  include ltQMainWindowgt include ltQTimergt include dialogmodal.h  namespace Ui  class MainWindow   class MainWindow  public QMainWindow      QOBJECT  public     explicit MainWindowQWidget parent  0     MainWindow     QTimer mqTimer     DialogModal mpModeless private     UiMainWindow ui private slots     void TimerElapsed     void onpbStartTestclicked   endif  MAINWINDOWH codepre  pDialogModal Headerp  precodeifndef DIALOGMODALH define DIALOGMODALH  include ltQDialoggt  namespace Ui  class DialogModal   class DialogModal  public QDialog      QOBJECT  public     explicit DialogModalQWidget parent  0     DialogModal  private slots     void onpbExitclicked  private     UiDialogModal ui   endif  DIALOGMODALH codepre  pDialogModal sourcep  precodeinclude dialogmodal.h include uidialogmodal.h  DialogModalDialogModalQWidget parent      QDialogparent,     uinew UiDialogModal      uigtsetupUithis   DialogModalDialogModal      delete ui   void DialogModalonpbExitclicked      close  codepre  pIs there anyway to give focus to the modeless dialog even when one or more modal dialog are presentp

Negative 28949 pIm writing a Wordpress plugin, but Im not convinced this is a Wordpressspecific issue...p  pMy plugin defines a class.

Im currently on Wordpress v3.8.1 and Im looking in codewpincludesplugin.phpcode.

I stopped calling loadview and viewdidload as per jsds instructions. And instead moved all code in my loadview to another function that I called from loadview. All this code does is instantiate the UI initview objects and places them in the correct places depending upon orientation.p  pThen I create another function that removes all subviews from the view. Then on orientation change I call this function and my initview to destroy all subviews and then recreate them on orientation change.p

Also, when the content gets bigger click emAdd contentem in JSFiddle few times I need the emmainem box to enlarge and emfooterem to move accordingly.p  pIt renders just fine in Chrome and Firefox. You probably wont be able to run it in IE8 it doesnt render JSFiddle, but emborderboxem property on emmainem is completely ignored and so that emmainem box is 200px higher than it should be  the emfooterem is below the visible area of screen.p  pAs it looks like it couldnt be handled by using emborderboxem and emminheightem, Im looking for any other solution for IE8. The only one that came to my mind was using emcalcem, that is emheight calc100  200pxem but IE8 doesnt support that as well. By the way I have a conditional adding emie8em class on emhtmlem element when ran in IE8, so I dont need a cross browser solution  just CSS to get the desired layout in that particular browser.p

What Ive noticed is it works great Until I use either codegtselect[fieldscode or codegtpaginate , [fields]code to select a subset of the models attributes. When I do this, it automatically culls any eager loaded model, which results in the relationship being NULL. Any clean way around thisp
Negative 28949 pI am trying to transfer a large file from a server to a client. My code so far works but only if I set the buffer size in the client code to the exact size of the file. I wont always know what the file size is going to be.

Negative 28949 pUltimately, Id like to includeexclude certain javascript files based on... whatever.  Simply defining the Media class, by itself, wont work since that is only evaluated once. p  pI know I can do this by making a custom admin template, but Im wondering if theres a simple way to do it by just making the media property dynamic.p  pThis is what I have so farp  precodefrom django.contrib import admin class MyModelAdminadmin.ModelAdmin     model  MyModel     ...      property     def mediaself         media  superMyModelAdmin, self.media         if whateverconditionIwant              somehow add myjsfile3.js         return media  class Media     css           all              mycssfile1.css,             mycssfile2.css,                   js           myjsfile1.js,         myjsfile2.js,      codepre  pAnd that almost works, but I found that calling codesuperMyModelAdmin, self.mediacode ignores my current classs Media definitions. In poking around, I found that this is because the parent classs media property is wrapped by codedjango.forms.widgets.mediapropertycode via codeMediaDefiningClasscode and since Im overriding media, my media property isnt being wrapped.  I tried manually wrapping it viap  precodefrom django.forms import mediaproperty MyModelAdmin.media  mediapropertyMyModelAdmin codepre  pbut mediaproperty fails to import.p  pHow can I make it include my static media and my dynamic media, and how do I add my dynamic media in a way that django is happy withp

Negative 28949 pI have one namespace for example codeAppcode that contains all my app encapsulated, currently Im using composer to autoload this namespace using PSR0 and checking for two different folders, strongMainstrong and strongClientstrong. Giving priority to the client folder, allowing me to override the main app functionality to meet the clients requests by only creating the necessary override files in the clients folderp  pNow, Im thinking that it would be better if the clients override classes extended the original one, because I realized that the main use for this is to edit only some of the class methods, and I want to future proof the override class for new methods that could appear in the main class. And Ive been struggling with a way to make this happen, keeping the namespaces.p  pstrongemExample Sales Controller Class  AppControllerSaleemstrongp  ul liIf there isnt a ClientAppControllerSale.php file it uses the default MainAppControllerSale.phpli lipBut if there is, what I want is that strongClientAppControllerSale.phpstrong could be able to extend strongMainAppControllerSale.phpstrongp  precodeltphp    namespace AppController   use MainControllerSale as OriginalClass The Sale class in Main Folder    class Sale extend OriginalClass ... codepreli lipThis way, I could override only some methods in the clients class and if the main class gets updated it would be reflected in the clients app.pli ul  pThe problem is, that since both, the client and main class are in the codeAppcode namespace, I cant figure out  a way to get the use statement above to work. The main reason is that any prepended namespace in the example emMain  namespaceem that I put in it wont work, because the files namespace would be different.p  pAnother way I thought it could work is by tinkering with the composer autoload, and check if the namespace starts with Main or maybe Original, then remove that part from the namespace and force to use the Main folder. But I couldnt find where this could be implemented.p  pAnother solution I considered was to subdivide the main class functionality in sub classes, that could be overridden using the current autoload scheme, but I dont know if it is wise to have so many classes and files scattered through the system.p  pAny help or guidance is always welcome.p

Negative 28949 pI have a table called Bookings. This table contains data representing a booking made for a particular service, with many variables.p  pA while ago I came across a problem with my current data structure whereby any changes to the booking that affected times, dates or prices would affect other associated financial records, bookings lists for dates etc.p  pMy solution at the time was to create a Modifications table which would track any changes made to a Booking. Then, whenever the Booking model was asked to return a booking, it would add on Modifications made in the codeafterFindcode Cake callback and present the most uptodate version of the booking, something like this excuse the Paint drawingp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comR5mCv.png altenter image description herep  pThis method works fine when you ask the Booking model to return booking 1234. It returns the most uptodate representation of the booking including all modifications layered on top of each other, including an array containing all the modifications strongandstrong the original booking data for reference.p  pstrongMy problemstrong is that Ive recently realised that I need to be able to query this model with custom conditions, and if one of those conditions was realised in one of the modifications, the result wouldnt match because the model is searching the original record rather than the finally presented record. Example where I query the model to return rows where codeabccode is blue not greyp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comTnpFh.png altenter image description herep  pIn that example, the model looks straight at the original data for rows where codeabccode is blue and doesnt return this result, because the blue value is in a Modification which is attached strongafterstrong the original results are found.p  pWhat Ive done now is put a query into the codebeforeFindcode callback of the Booking model to look for modifications that match the given criteria, joining the booking to make sure that any other criteria still matches. When it returns the blue in example above, it stores that result in an array as a class property and continues with the regular codefindcode, but strongexcludesstrong that bookings ID from being returned because weve found a more uptodate verison of it. Then itll merge them together, sort them again etc in the codeafterFindcode.p  pThis works, although its a little more longwinded that I was hoping for.p  pAfter all that, Ive realised that in other parts of this application, there are models that are manually joining to the bookings table and searching for bookings. So now I need a way to be able to incorporate the modifications into all of those manual joins straight to the table in MySQL without affecting the original data and preferably without changing too much of my code.p  pMy thoughts were that I need to remove the manual join and create a model association instead. Will the codebeforeFindcode and codeafterFindcode of the Booking model still run when I query say the Customer model which hasMany Bookings to apply the modifications to each bookingp  pMy other option was to return more rows from MySQL than necessary by removing any criteria that might be contained in the modifications, then use PHP to filter the results as per my search criteria. This option scared me a little because the result set has the potential to be massive without that criteria...p  hr  pHow can I achieve this data structure My key requirements are still that I do not want to change the original Booking record, rather add Modification records on top, but I need to be able to query bookings including modifications through the model.p  pI want to try and keep as much of this integration behind the scenes as possible so I wont have to go through my entire application to change codencode number of queries that look like thisp  precodegetblue  thisgtBookinggtfindall, array     conditions gt array         Booking.abc gt blue       codepre  pI want to be able to implicitly include any modifications made to bookings so that the uptodate booking will be returned in the above query.p  pThe other problem is when the Booking model is manually joined to a search query, like thisp  precodegettransactionsonbluebookings  thisgtTransactiongtfindall, array     joins gt array         array             table gt sqlbookingstable,  nonstandard Cake format, I know  its an example             alias gt Booking,             type gt LEFT,             conditions gt Booking.bookingid  Transaction.bookingid              ,     conditions gt array         Booking.abc gt blue       codepre  pAs you can see, the above query wont include the modification in my MSPaint example above, because its manually joining the table in SQL the modification integration is in the codebeforecode and codeafterFindcode callback functions of the Booking model.p  pAny help on this would be greatly appreciated.p  h1Edith1  pI know this is long enough already, but I thought Id add that the reason I want to track these changes and not update the original record is that the strongfinancialstrong aspect cant change, because it will affect reporting.p  pThe quickest and easiest solution I can see so far is to apply modifications directly to the original booking in all cases except when it affects financial information, which is still tracked as a modification because I dont currently need to search based on this info.p

Negative 28949 pI want to have the same developing environment either in Linux and in Windows so I decided to use Qt Creator. But for some unknown reason I cannot trace my project in Qt Creator under Windows 7. I compile my program as DEBUG target, the resulting executable contains all debug info.

Negative 28949 pIn a recent fun project a system for managing bills and clients I decided to use PDO as database interface. I came along the problem, that I was constantly writing the same code when using prepared statements prepare, set parameters, execute etc. so I decided to write a little helper class which contains methods which are faster to use select, selectRow, etc..p  pI know that this is not optimal, and that PDO itself is already good enough I have read through some other questions regarding PDO helper classes, but my question refers more to the general design when using static helper classesp  pHeres some code of my first approachp  precodeclass DBA    private con    public function construct        thisgtcon  new PDO  ..        public function select query, params  array       sth  thisgtcongtpreparequery      ....        returns an object   public function fetchObject query, params  array, class      sth  this gt con gt preparequery     sth gt setFetchModePDOFETCHCLASS, class     ..     ...   class Bill      public date     public payed      ...      public function markAsPayed         dba  new DBA       ifdba gt exec UPDATE .., args           return true,              return false         index.php dba  new DBA  bill  dba gt fetchObject SELECT .., args, Bill bill gt markAsPayed codepre  pI discovered the following problem I was using the class in other classes by creating an instance of it for example in objects I fetched from rows from my database. So there would be tons of instances which means tons of connections of the helper class, because I was creating an instance in every method in other classes, that used the helper class. When I was calling methods, that used the helper class, on objects which were created by the helper class, the whole application got super slow.p  pWould it be a good solution to make the helper class static And if so, how do I connect to the database Should I use singleton pattern I dont want to reconnect to the database in every method of the helper class, but have a global connection in the helper class.p

Negative 28949 pI recently picked up Emanuele Feronatos Flash Game Development by Example to try and help expand my knowledge of game design and actionscript 3, and Im stuck on the first chapter where were building basically a memory match two game where you have ten sets of tiles and you try and match them up by clicking on them.p  pIn the code Im stuck on, Mr. Feronato is adding the tiles to the stage using a for loop and addChild, heres the code in particularp  precode tile placing loop for iuint0 iltNUMBEROFTILES i  tile  new tilemovieclip addChildtile tile.cardTypetiles[i] tile.x5tile.width5iTILESPERROW tile.y5tile.height5Math.flooriTILESPERROW tile.gotoAndStopNUMBEROFTILES21 tile.buttonMode  true tile.addEventListenerMouseEvent.CLICK,onTileClicked   end of tile placing loop codepre  pIn the 5th line, you can see that he creates a custom property of the tile variable called cardType, but when I try and run the code I get the error Access of possibly undefined property cardType through a reference with static type Tile. I have the class Tile extending MovieClip, and the main class extends Sprite, but as far as I can tell Ive written the code exactly as in the book and cant get past this. I thought about just using a normal int variable cardType to hold tiles[i] but later on you use the cardType property on a mouse event so Im a little stuck. p  pHas something changed in Flash that no longer allows you to create custom properties in this way Or did I just do something stupid that Im not catching. p  pAs always, thank you so much for the help.p

Negative 28949 pI have made an online website which acts as the fronted for a database into which my customers can save sales information. So each customer logs onto the online website with their own credentials and only see their own sales records. The database comes in the form of codeSQL Server 2008code.p  pSome of these customers have a third party Windows tool on their PCs which itself acts as a fronted for a database with specific sales records. This tool is used by them for printing receipts. This tool comes with a Python interface which can be used to update the database, if the tool itself is not used. Ive installed the tool on my PC and successfully added records to this tools database by running a simple Python Script.p  pAt the moment, customers are adding by hand sales information from my website to the tool on the PC. I would like to provide them with an automatic way of doing this. This syncing should only occur when the customer requests such a sync and indeed they have all requested that it should work so. This is to ensure that they get an opportunity to validate the information. p  pHow might I solve this problem Should I develop a PC application which they install on their local computer or can I do this via the browser Either solution will need to execute Python code in order to update the database on their PC and then there are of course security issues. p
Negative 28949 pI have a requirement to build one parent site and few child sites..using domain and subdomain concept and want to have installations of joomla at parent and all subdomains. But I want only my parent site to hold user data and Alpha user points data while my child sites would be hosting components and modules separately and use user data and Alpha user points data from parent site.p  pCould any one suggest me is it a good Architecture to go and is there any extension or component already available to achieve it. Example belowp  pparent site movies.com Child sites braveheart.movies.com, troy.movies.comp  pI will have forums, blogs and other component installations at braveheart and troy subdomains seperately while my Alpha user points and users dbtables would reside at movies.commain domain.p  pIts like singlesign on or Centralised Alhpa user points, but free to install same component and modules at different subdomains.p  pHighly appreciate any replies or solutions proposed p
Negative 28949 pCurrently I am redirecting a script to a log file with the following commandp  precodepython usrhomescriptsmyscript.py 2gtamp1  tee usrhomelogsmylogfile.log codepre  pThis seems to work but it does not write to the file as soon as there is a print command. Rather it waits until there is a group of lines that it can print. I want the console and the log file to be written to simultaneously. How can this be done with output redirection. Note that running the script on the console prints everything when it should. Though doing a tail f on the logfile is not smooth since it writes about 50 lines at a time. Any suggestionsp

Negative 28949 pYesterday I asked a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions25319027resumingatictactoegameinandroidafterclosingthefragmentthisa question on the network about how to resume a simple Tictactoe game after closing and opening the fragment. As I said in my questionp  blockquote   pIm learning Android development by creating a test project   Tictactoe. My Tictactoe app starts with a Main Menu activity with   a Button that says New Game. After clicking New Game, an activity with   a fragment containing a TicTacToe game in a GridLayout launches.   The user can play the game, but when they go back to the Main Menu,   the game state is not saved.p      pI want to change this so that when the user goes back to the Main   Menu, they will see a new Button called Continue in addition to the   New Game Button. Once the user clicks Continue, the game they   were playing before continues. If the click the New Game button, a   new game will be launched like before.p blockquote  pThree answers were proposed with two different methods Utilizing codeSharedPreferencescode or using codestartActivityForResultcode. Both of those methods seem to work fine, but I stumbled upon a cleaner solution, by just declaring the TicTacToe object as staticp  precodepublic static TicTacToe t  new TicTacToe codepre  pThis appears to do everything I need since now I will only have one instance of codetcode no matter how often I create or destroy the fragment. So on orientation changes, going back to Main Menu and opening the game again, or even on closing and restarting the app, the game state stays the same just like I wanted.

Negative 28949 pI am in the final stages of developing a mobile app, but am curious about one aspect with it. Under normal circumstances, things such as login pages and whatnot on a standard website should always be secured with SSL, however Im not 100 certain how that correlates to an HTML5based mobile app. If I have an area in the app where data that I wish to be secured and ultimately encrypted in the database is being sent via HTTP POST, if the URL I am posting to is protected via SSL, is it a secure transmission Im assuming so, but am not finding a lot of detail in either direction so I am curious if this works as expected. The backend is guaranteed using an SSL certificate from a trusted authority, so if I post to that is the payload encryptedp

Negative 28949 pI wasnt sure what to title this question, so if you want to change it, be my guest.p  pI am wondering if there is some way to run a block of Ruby code in compliance with a previos version of the ruby language. It would essentially be some sort of compatability mode but only for a block of code.p  pMy idea was to chagne the RUBYVERSION global variable, and see if Ruby then behaved as it would in that version, but this seems to do nothing. Here is my attemptp  precodeputs RUBYVERSION  anobject  Time.now  anobject.tap do o   puts in tep function end  gt anobject  RUBYVERSION  1.7 potentially change ruby version to an older version to run legacy code  attempt to run a function that was not available in version 1.7, just an example anobject.tap do o   puts in tep function end  gt anobject  puts RUBYVERSION codepre  pI realize that I could code a conditional, and test the current version of Ruby, and then execute code based on the results of that test, but that doesnt fit my needs, and it would be better to just refactor all of our unit tests and acceptance tests if it came down to this. p

Negative 28949 pIn languages that use static binding like java you can define multiple functions all having the same name but different parameters. Learning Python, until now I considered the lack of this mainly as safety issue like codeboolparameterFalsecode might be interpreted as codeTruecode because of the quotes. I thought I would simply need to be more careful.p  pNow I found a situation, where the lack of static binding is simply inconvenient. Please consider this tupelp  precodevar  1, foo, 2, bar, 3, potato codepre  pTo remove an item from codevarcode with static binding one could do something like thispseudocodep  precodedef delitemint i      search item with x  i,       remove this item  def delitemString s      search item with , x  s      remove this item codepre  pI find this very convenient, because no conditions are needed to select the right action to perform. Furthermore this code makes overloading easier, as one can decide to just overload one of the functions or both.p  pTrying to deal with a situation like this in Python, I only find inconvenient solutions like some ifclauses that check for the type.p  pIs there a better wayp

Negative 28949 pI am creating a Django application and trying to include more search boxes in Django web admin interface for a specific model, so that users can simultaniously search more fields. For example, users can enter in one search box the name of the city, and in another search box the name of the street, and all model instances which have corresponding city and street are shown in browser after Search button is hit. Default admin web interface has only one search box. Ive added three search boxes in codechangelist.htmlcode file, and when I enter some data in those search boxes in browser and hit Search, a proper URL is formed with query string containing those three input parameters by which the search shoould be done. Then I capture those input parameters in codequerysetcode method which I have overriden in my class that extends codemodels.AdminModelcode calss, perform query set filtering and finally return the filtered queryset. Now, the problem is that the filtered query set is simply not shown on the web page web interface of my model after the search process is done, it says that no matches were found. But I am definately sure that my filtered query set contains data beacues I print it in command line just before the codereturncode command of codequerysetcode method is executed, and it prints correct data. p  pHere is my codequerysetcode methodp  precodedef querysetself, request      qs  superUkopcanjeAdmin, self.querysetrequest     if mjesto in request.GET         lokacija  request.GET.getmjesto,None         if lokacija             qs  qs.filtermjestoicontainslokacija      if ulica in request.GET         ulica  request.GET.getulica,None         if ulica             qs  qs.filterulicaicontainsulica      if naziv in request.GET         naziv  request.GET.getnaziv,None         if naziv             qs  qs.filternazivicontainsnaziv      print qs this prints correct filtered data     return qs codepre  pWhy isnt filtered query set shown in web interfacep  pstrongEDIT strong Thanks to my friend, Ive finally managed to solve the problem. And solution is quite simple, all I had to do is move the whole code of codequerysetcode method to codegetsearchresultscode method, and along filtered queryset return codefalsecode  boolean parameter because codegetsearchresultscode method returns two parameters. So if anybody wants to customize the search process in Django, the codegetsearchresultscode method should be used. There you can access query string argumnets and retreive some data the way you want.p

Negative 28949 pI am wondering whether it is possible to speed up pandas codedataframe.groupbycode with the following applicationp  pBasic data structurep  ul liHDFStore with 9 columnsli li4 columns are columns with data codecolFcode ... codecolIcodeli lithe combination of the remaining 5 columns codecolAcode ... codecolEcode gives a unique indexli licodecolEcode is a last modified columnli ul  pThe basic idea is to implement a data base with a transactional memory. Assuming an entry changes, I dont delete it but write a new row with a new value in the last modified column. This allows me to retroactively look at how entries have changed over time.p  pHowever, in situations where I only want the currently valid state of the data, it requires selecting only those rows with the most recent last modified columnp  precodeidx  df.groupby[colA, colB, colC, colD],                   asindexFalse, sortFalse[colE].max dfcurrentstate  df.mergeidx, inner, on[colA, colB, colC, colD, colE] codepre  pThis codegroupbycode method eats up about 70 of my run time.p  pNote For the majority of rows, there exists only a single entry with respect to the last modified column. Only for very few, multiple versions of the row with different last modified values exist.p  pstrongIs there a way to speed up this process other than changing the program logic as followsstrongp  hr  h2Alternative Solution without need for codegroupbycodeh2  pAdd an additional boolean column codeactiveStatecode which stores whether the row is part of the active state.p  pWhen rows change, mark their codeactiveStatecode field as codeFalsecode and insert a new row with codeactiveStateTruecode.p  pOne can then query the table with codeactiveStateTruecode rather than use codegroupbycode.p  pMy issue with this solution is that it has the potential for mistakes where the codeactiveStatecode field is not set appropriately. Of course this is recoverable from using the last modified column, but if the codegroupbycode could be sped up, it would be foolproof...p

Negative 28949 pIve been working on HBase from a couple of week, still in design state for my project with an ongoing POC. Now before i ask my query let me give brief description of what ive inferenced. p  pThe basic unit of horizontal scalability in HBase is called a Region. Regions are a subset of the tables data and they are essentially a contiguous, sorted range of rows that are stored together. when regions become too large after adding more rows, the region is split into two at the middle key, creating two roughly equal halves.p  pThe multimap structure of a HBase table can thus be summarized as key  family  column  timestamp  value.p  pHBase, internally, keeps special catalog tables named ROOT and .META. within which it maintains the current list, state, and location of all regions afloat on the cluster. The ROOT table holds the list of .META. table regions. The .META. table holds the list of all userspace regions. Entries in these tables are keyed by region name, where a region name is made of the table name the region belongs to, the regions start row, its time of creation, and finally, an MD5 hash of all of the former p  pNumbers of rows that can be stored in a region depends upon threshold value defined for a region i.e. this is something what i believe can be given manually. p  pSO what i want to do is p  pIf a table with USERID , ROLE amp YEAR is their with lets say millions of tuples. I want to create two layers. One layer with region nodes differentiated on years range. lets say one region stored data from 1990  1995 , another stores data from 1996  2000 and so on. amp second layer having differentiated on roles. for example one region node keeps data for admin id 1, another for usersid 2 and so on. Each layer has its own region server and mapped in meta table and meta table managed by ZOOKEEPER. Refer below figure for further clarification  img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comemmtC.png altenter image description here p  pPerhaps more than one zookeepers may work in sync managed by another zookeeper above them.p  pSo this is the design what ill be proposing and i want to inquire about its feasibilityp

Im new to this, and dont throw tomatoes, but is it possible and not insane to use javascript top  p1 retrieve the vh and vw values upon load and resize this part I know can be done with viewport, verge, etcp  p2 replace all the css calc functions with the same inside javascriptp  p3 output the resulting div sizes to the stylesheetp  pHelp greatly appreciated, but I realize this would mean javascript is responsible for the entire layout and thats frowned upon. I just cant see how else to do it.  If theres a solid practical reason the concept is doomed, or another approach, Id like to know about that too.  p  pThank you.p

A file is characterized by its revision. Lets say the revision is added to file name, and there is a symlink to the file which can be used by the processes to read it. The processes cannot for some reasons synchronize with mutexes, semaphores and so on, but they are able to create auxiliary files and folders.

Negative 28949 pI am running a background job in parse which matches users and i want it to save the match data as soon as the match is made however it only saves once the job is finished. Because parse has a minimum time between jobs of 1 minute it means that users could often have to wait up to a full minute to be matched which is way too long. Is there a way i can make it save the data as it goesp

Negative 28949 pin my WCF service I have element of type String maxLength 10000 where I am expecting to receive Xml content using CDATA. For some reason when the text inside CDATA is more than some particular length in this case if I add anything more than 2497 character one of my schema validation module throws error This message cannot support the operation because it has been copiedp  pWhen I remove the extra character so 2498 length string doesnt work and 2497 string works it just works fine which is confusing because I never though the size would cause this issue.p  pI can post some sample if that is helpful, but this above explanation should make it.p  pIs there any limitation on size of CDATA when working with WCFp

Negative 28949 pI am trying to bulid a crud app based on requests where the user have to create a request in order to CreateEditDelete. I would describe a simple example like this p  precodeclass Employeemodels.Model     firstname  models.CharFieldmaxlength30     lastname  models.CharFieldmaxlength30     dob  models.DateField      etc.  codepre  pNow I want to control the creation of the employee which will be easy to me by adding two fields called Approved and Approved By. p  pThe problem now with editing. I want to create a request with OLD and NEW values. when the admin approve then apply the new values to the instance, otherwise delete the new values from the system. p  pSo Far the best solution to me is to use ContentType framework by Django. like this. p  precodeACTIONS               C, Create,             D, Delete,             U, Update           class Requestermodels.Model           This is the base of all the requests          initiatedby  models.ForeignKeyauth.User, verbosenameInitiated By, relatednameinitiatedby     reviewedby  models.ForeignKeyauth.User, verbosenameReviewd By, blankTrue, nullTrue, relatednamereviewedby     contenttype  models.ForeignKeycontenttypes.ContentType     itemid  models.IntegerFieldblankTrue, nullTrue     action  models.CharFieldmaxlength1, choicesACTIONS     createdat  models.DateTimeFieldCreated At, autonowaddTrue     reviewedat  models.DateTimeFieldReviewed At, autonowTrue codepre  pThis works fine with me for creation and deletion requests. However, the update requests have to temporary save the new values. Which I couldnt find a way to do it other than creating a new model Ex. Employee and put the new values in it. then replace the values from the new one to the old one. finally delete the new one. which will cause a problem in IDs Employee with ID  5 the next might be 7 based on the Temporary saved instances in the databasep  pI need a solution to not apply the Update without more replication of the data.p

The stack trace in the crash report shows that it is busy with AutoLayout related calls at the point of crashp  h1EDITh1  pI am wanting to disable the use of AutoLayout in a part of my view hierarchy solely to gain performance benefits in scrolling a document with complex layout.p  pMy scrollView is performing scrolling on a control akin to a tableView it is a spreadsheet grid. My approach has been to move aka relayout cells from the left as you scroll right etc... What I find is that when I scroll really fast there is a lageffect which manifests as flashingflickering in the corner of the screen with the cells being unable to move across fast enough. They do of course catch up 500ms1000ms or so later, but it doesnt look as good as it could.p  pUsing Instruments time profiler I could also see that a large percentage of the busy time was taken by layout amp display with layout being about even with display. I also performed tests without content being loaded into the cells to hone in on whether it was layout that was not happening fast enough and it isnt. p  pMore anecdotally, looking at Instruments AutoLayout I could certainly see that it was very busy attending to constraints during scrolling though I cant say whether this was necessarily bad.p  pMy thinking is that with a complex by number of moving parts viewcontrol like this one, AutoLayout may take longer to mathematically solve the constraint set problem than the time it would take if I directly tell it what the new frames are directly. p

Negative 28949 pLet X be a collection of n points in some moderatedimensional space  for now, say R5. Let S be the convex hull of X, let p be a point in S, and let v be any direction. Finally, let L  p  lambda v  lambda a real number be the line passing through p in direction v. p  pI am interested in finding a reasonably efficient algorithm for computing the intersection of S with L. Id also be interested in hearing if it is known that no such algorithm exists Note that this intersection can be represented by the extreme two points of intersection of L with the boundary of S. Im particularly interested in finding an algorithm that behaves well when n is large.p  pI should say that it is easy to do this very efficiently in two dimensions. In that case, one can order the points of X in clockwise order as seen from p, and then do binary search. So, the initial ordering takes On logn steps and then further lookups take Ologn steps. I dont see what the analogous algorithm should be in higher dimensions. Part of the problem is that a convex body in two dimensions has n vertices and n faces, while a convex body in 3 or higher dimensions can have n vertices but many, many more than n faces.p

Negative 28949 pWe have an Android application that we are building with GradleAndroid Studio and are using JaCoCo to generate code coverage reports for our unit tests this is working great.  We are also interested in being able to generate coverage reports for manual tests as well that is, show what code was covered in an arbitrary application launch.  It appears that JaCoCos predecessor a hrefhttpwww.eclemma.orgindex.html relnofollowEclEmmaa was capable of this, but I have not been able to find any confirmation one way or the other about JaCoCo though I am beginning to assume it impossible from the lack of discourse.p  pI have tried using EclEmma from Eclipse just to have something, but the latest version fails with a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11677754eclipsewithadtjunittestnotrunningwitheclemmathis errora, and I couldnt immediately get older versions to work either.p  pCan anyone confirm whether or not it is possible to generate coverage data on an arbitrary application launch with JaCoCo As in, run the app, press buttons, close the app and get a report on what code was exercised by the buttons you pushed.  If not, is there another tool that can accomplish thisp  pThanksp
Negative 28949 pLets say I have given a user an access code.

My question is simply, how would I go about writing the loop portionp

Negative 28949 pSo Im now at my witts end with this one.  As the question in the title asks, Im trying to set the tsc version for a sample ASP.NET 5 MVC 6 project.  Im using Visual Studio 2015 RC and I want to compile TypeScript using version 1.5 Beta that was recently released.  In VS 2013, this was an option page in the project properties.  I thought there would be some magic project.json value I could set, but nope.  If I could even turn off the compilation version 1.4 and use a Gulp task, even that would I could count as progress.p

Negative 28949 pHi I was trying to create an associated image with my pins in the modelsp  pI added hasattachedfile avatar at the first time because I just copied the code from the paperclip page on github. In fact, the attribute should be more precisely defined as hasattachedfile image instead of avatar p  pI finished the whole process using avatar until I realized it I should change the name to image. With avatar, I ran  rails generate paperclip pin image  rake dbmigrate  and I updated the pins in the controller as well so that it can take in images I upload. p  pwhen I switched to hasattachedfile image, I wasnt able to run db migrate because of an error duplicate columns.  then I used rake dbmigrate VERSION0 to clear up previous columns and I redid the migrate. p  pBut this time when I try to add params.requirepin.permitdescription, image it reports an error when I try to upload an image using the file uploader. the only way it can go through is when i change image in the line to avatar  params.requirepin.permitdescription, avatarp  pCan anyone explain the reason for this error and how to fix it p  pMany thanks p

Negative 28949 pI am using angular UIRouter and bootstrap collapse panels to build a sidebar for a style guide.

Negative 28949 pIm working with a team of developers on an Android media player device. Were having a very bad time because the SD cards are keep getting corrupted and we dont have a clue why. At random times but after a few days of rw cycles on them they cant be accessed anymore and we need to replace them.p  pI was reading an article about hardware bugs and this thing caught my attentionp  p...The clock lets the hardware device  which isnt directly connected to the CPU  stay in sync with the code the CPU is running. The clock determines the Baud Rate  the rate at which data is sent from one side to the other. If the timing gets messed up, the hardware or the software  or both  get confused. This is really, really bad, and usually results in data corruption.p  pSo I was thinking...could there be a possibility that the baud rate is related to our sdusb cards corruption problem Maybe theres a difference between the sdusb card baud rate and the devices reader controller baud ratep  pSomething similar happened a hrefhttpletsmakerobots.comstrangeproblemwhensavingdatasdcard relnofollowherea, although in a different projectp  pQuote However I cannot receive the file from the PC via the Xbee and write it to the SD card without loosing chunks for the file.p  pFull disclaimer Im not a developer but a BA. I have no idea if my question is a nonsense, Im just trying to find an answer to our problem.p

Negative 28949 pIve used a blank page where i have textboxes for a title, subtitle and for a description. Ive added a split page in my app and what i want to do is to be able to get the textbox text from the blank page and add it to the split page where it will be displayed with the details after clicking a button.p  pIve checked out how to dynamically add items to a grid view but i want the items to be in the split page format where you click an item on the left side and the description comes to the right side. Also saw in the splitpage.xaml.cs some TO DO parts where am supposed to bind data and handle selected items i.ep  precode TODO Assign a bindable group to this.DefaultViewModel[Group]   TODO Assign a collection of bindable items to this.DefaultViewModel[Items]    TODO Invoke this.itemsViewSource.View.MoveCurrentTo with the selected  item as specified by the value of pageState[SelectedItem]    TODO Derive a serializable navigation parameter and assign it to pageState[SelectedItem]  codepre  pMy question is how do i do that or at least how to add the textbox data to the split page Any help would be appreciated.

Negative 28949 pIm working on a game, and Ive created a function in my codePlayercode class that calls another function for every other player in the game in order.

Negative 28949 pI have a 64 bit C DLL that I do not have code for.  I do have the .h and .lib corresponding files.p  pI can call 2 of the APIs without issues. They return the version number. So this tells me the DLL is loaded correctly in my application and all is good.p  pThe problematic API takes const char p  precodebool funcconst char a, const char b, const char c, const char d, const char e, int number codepre  pI have created a C wrapper for thisp  precode[DllImportmDllName, CharSetCharSet.Ansi, CallingConventionCallingConvention.Cdecl] private static extern bool funcstring a,                                             string b,                                             string c,                                             string d,                                             string e,                                              int number codepre  pI know this wrapper is ok, because the parameters are filenames. If I pass in an non existing filename I get a dialog generated from the DLL saying so and so filename doesnt exist. However this function crashes with Access violation reading location 0x3C.p  pSo my take is that there is no issue with the c wrapper I wrote. I know the C dll works ok as I am trying to convert an existing working c application to c. The c application already uses the DLL in question.p  pSo what may be going on here My take is maybe there is a bug in the actual DLL but the problem is not severe enough to present in the c application as perhaps memory is not checked more rigidly as in the C applicationp  pIf this is the case is there any setting I can turn off to check memory less rigidly in c Or what are my options, taking into account I do not and will never gain access to the source code of the DLL. I really want this application in c.p  pFURTHER ANALYSIS I created a simple WIN32 64bit DLL that has these APIsp  precodedeclspecdllexport char hello      return Hello from DLL    declspecdllexport int number      return 1979  codepre  pI have C wrappers as belowp  precode[DllImportMAFuncWrapper.dll, CharSetCharSet.Ansi] public static extern string hello  [DllImportMAFuncWrapper.dll] public static extern int number codepre  pI can succesfully call number but trying to call hello gives mep  precodeFirstchance exception at 0x00000000774B4102 ntdll.dll in WindowsFormsApplication1.exe 0xC0000374 A heap has been corrupted parameters 0x000000007752B4B0.

Negative 28949 pIve read many of the XACML questions and answers, which have been remarkably helpful, especially the links provided in many of the answers. But I havent found what I was looking for, namely UML Class diagrams that represent the various interactions of the XACML components of PDP, PIP, Context Handler and the rest. Can  anyone point to such a thing The answer to a prayer would be a MagicDraw representation, but thats too much to hope for. p

Negative 28949 pIs it possible to extend Sparks RDDs in Python to add custom operators If its not possible, how can one wrap Scala code for a class that extends an RDD, such as the one here a hrefhttpblog.madhukaraphatak.comextendingsparkapi relnofollowhttpblog.madhukaraphatak.comextendingsparkapiap  pEdit I am trying to create a new RDD, say PersonRDD and add a set of new operators on the PersonRDD, ex.

Negative 28949 pThe Question is what is the memory efficient way to hold Recources. And I do not mean the actual images, strings.. but the object of type Resources from context.getResources .  Its much text, so I sat the questions bold.p  pSo there would be two ways  holding the Context and retrieve the Resources with context.getResources or to hold the Resources directly.  strongI suppose that Context is more heavyweight than Resourcesstrong strongIs the Resources Object reasonable smallstrongp  pAnd would it be better to instanciate this Manager onCreate of the App  so it would have to be strongrecreated on every Orientationstrong Change strongorstrong would it be small enough to hold it strongas staticstrong and only destroy if the app is really closed by userp  pThe R classes of all the apks combined have 62kB so I think holding the Resources objects and a ID translation Table should not get me into troublep  pBackground why I want to know such things I have a rather complex app  which constists of multiple .apks  like 2 to 4 a main app and up to 3 plugins that have services and Fragments wich run in the main apps Activity.p  pNow a customer wants that app branded with this own style  not only colors but also other icon, sting resources, background images, in some cases even different layouts.p  pI dont want to include all this new resources into our app and blow it up but rather make a new apk wich includes all the changed resources and have a Resource Manager in the main Activity which loads a resource from this theme or if not present from the original resources.p  pNow of cause I want that ResourceManager of mine to be as fast, memory efficient as possible.p  pIm opting right now to hold WeakReferences of the Resouces objects there so everything can be GCed. And to build up a ResourceID resolution table that holds the theme Ids corresponding to the original IDs or a 0 to mark that the corresponding resouce is not themed  so I only have to look up the resouce once with a getResourceName call to the original resouces and a getIdentifier call to the theme resources.p  pstrongPerhaps there is a wholle different approach to thisstrongp

Negative 28949 pI got some strange issues with transparency and 3d particles. A short vid to illustrate a hrefhttpsyoutu.beZHKI1X3MjhY relnofollowhttpsyoutu.beZHKI1X3MjhYa As you can see I have a 3d particle effect, fire burning. Inside it is a 3 model with no alpha blending and it shows just fine. then in the far distance there is a small skeleton with blending and alphatest turned on and it also shows just fine through the fire. Then I turn camera and look at the warrior skeleton and it just disappear and instead you see what is behind him. I turn camera again and the mage skeleton also vanishes, but you can see the trees a bit further away just fine and they have the exact same settings for blending and alpha test. If I move the character say 20 yards away it also starts showing through the fire effect.p  pSo it seems to have something to do with distance from the 3d particle effect...  p  pThe 3d particle batch is an extended BillboardParticleBatch like thisp  precodeprotected Renderable allocRenderable           BlendingAttribute banew BlendingAttributeGL20.GLSRCALPHA, GL20.GLONE,1f           Renderable r  super.allocRenderable          r.material  new Material   ba,                new DepthTestAttributeGL20.GLLEQUAL, 0.0f, 0.5f, true,                 r.material.setnew FloatAttributeFloatAttribute.AlphaTest, 0.0f,                TextureAttribute.createDiffusetexture           return r     codepre  pAll the characters and the trees are created with following attributesp  precodeif alpha           FloatAttribute floatAttribute  new FloatAttributeFloatAttribute.AlphaTest, 0.5f          BlendingAttribute blendingAttribute  new BlendingAttributeGL20.GLSRCALPHA, GL20.GLONEMINUSSRCALPHA, 1f          for int i  0 i lt bulletEntity.modelInstance.materials.size i                bulletEntity.modelInstance.materials.geti.setblendingAttribute                bulletEntity.modelInstance.materials.geti.setfloatAttribute                   codepre  pThe models are drawn first then the particles, I tried changing order but no difference. I have tried a lot of different setups for alphatest, depthtest and blendingattribute but can not find anything that works.p  pemEDITem I removed the Blending attribute from the 3dmodels and now it looks as it should regarding the particle effect. However I need most materials on my character models to have blending set..p  pAnyone got any clue why this is happening when I enable blendingp  pI also tried to use the BillboardParticleBatch without extending it in case I had done something there but the effect then is even worse. All models with blending enabled appear infront of the particle effect even though they stand behind it.p
