Positive 62074 pSo i have a couple of javascript files that I want to be ran in a specific order, and instead of doing script tags in the html page, Id like to use requirejs so that I can modularize code. Before I started modularizing with define blocks and start refactoring code, I wanted to just set up the dependency ordering. So I have the files like thisp  pindex.htmlp  precodeltscript srcscriptsdependsrequire.jsgtltscriptgt ltscriptgt     function         require[scriptsmain.js, function]      ltscriptgt codepre  pmain.jsp  precoderequire[scriptsservicesfileLoader.js, scriptsservicesOptions.js], function      do stuff  codepre  pfileLoader.jsp  precoderequire[     scriptsservicesalert.js,     scriptsservicesgame.js,     scriptsservicesparser.js,     scriptsservicesoptions.js ], function       do stuff  codepre  pNow its pretty obvious what I want here. I want the main to invoke fileLoader.js, and then I would like fileLoader.js to invoke each of its dependencies before it invokes its callback. Then when fileLoader.js has finished its callback then I would like for main to finish its dependencies similarly before finally invoking its callback last, which is what I thought requirejs did.p  pHowever here is what happens. Main calls require and I can see that fileLoader.js and options.js are loaded. But then before any of the dependencies needed by fileLoader are invoked nor its own callback which needs to be run for main to run correctly, the main.js callback is invoked. What is going onp  ptldr  main callback called before dependencys callback, whyp

Positive 62074 pI have a web app thats getting much bigger than expected, and it has quite a few JS files. I was looking for a way to load them quicker, and preferably asynchronous and with dependencies, meaning dont load them ALL at once, but load the ones that dont have dependencies but ARE dependencies first, then if they are loaded fine, load the ones dependent on them, etc etc.p  pI looked into HeadJS HJS and RequireJS RJS, and I had a few questions about both.p  pI first started to use HJS, and it looks like I got it working fine, but Im just not sure Im doing it right, if someone can verify, that would be cool, code here a hrefhttppastebin.comRCjpUKUS relnofollowhttppastebin.comRCjpUKUSap  pSo, first off... loading CSS asynchronous and with dependencies just like it can with JavaScript would be a huge plus, and I know HJS says it can do that, and I notice RJS says it cant, because its not possible to do it properly. So that means that either the developers of HJS knows something that the devs of RJS dont, or that the devs of HJS settled for something sloppy.. which would you say it is Granted, the sources that say its not possible are over 8 years old, but theres nothing more recent to debunk thatp  pAfter I used HJS a bit, I looked into RJS, and it looks a hell of a lot more powerful than HJS. So I thought about implementing it into my existing project. But as I started to look at some tutorials primarily a hrefhttpwww.sitepoint.comunderstandingrequirejsforeffectivejavascriptmoduleloading relnofollowthis onea, I kinda got the feeling that its not really something you can just throw existing code into, or just tell it to load specific files in order with dependencies, it looks like it kinda forces you to code your JS into a specific paradigm that they require for you to use their model.. Is that the case Or am I just looking at it incorrectly.p

The following assignment fails rarely, causing the problem      hdrgtreservedgtp1  malloc  chunk of private data        Probably more code to initiate playback   codepre  pNormally, the header is returned to the application by waveCompleteHeader, a function internal to wdmaud.dll. waveCompleteHeader tries to deallocate the pointer allocated by waveOutWrite by calling GlobalHandleGlobalUnlock and friends. Sometimes, GlobalHandle bombs, as shown above.p  pNow, the reason that GlobalHandle bombs is not due to a heap corruption, as I suspected at first  its because waveOutWrite returned without setting the first pointer in the internal structure to a valid pointer. I suspect that it frees the memory pointed to by that pointer before returning, but I havent disassembled it yet.p  pThis only appears to happen when the wave playback system is low on buffers, which is why Im using a single header to reproduce this.p  pAt this point I have a pretty good case against this being a bug in my application  after all, my application is not even running. Has anyone seen this beforep  pIm seeing this on Windows XP SP2. The audio card is from SigmaTel, and the driver version is 5.10.0.4995.p  pNotesp  pTo prevent confusion in the future, Id like to point out that the answer suggesting that the problem lies with the use of mallocfree to manage the buffers being played is simply wrong. Youll note that I changed the code above to reflect the suggestion, to prevent more people from making the same mistake  it doesnt make a difference. The buffer being freed by waveCompleteHeader is not the one containing the PCM data, the responsibility to free the PCM buffer lies with the application, and theres no requirement that it be allocated in any specific way.p  pAlso, I make sure that none of the waveOut API calls I use fail.p  pIm currently assuming that this is either a bug in Windows, or in the audio driver. Dissenting opinions are always welcome.p
Negative 62074 pI listen to the podcast java posse,  on this there is often discussion about components note components are not clearly objects.

Negative 62074 pI have a function coderesizePreviewcode that will resize an image in a jQuery dialog box if the image is too big.  This image can be changed by the user.  My code goes something like thisp  precodeimagePreview.attrsrc, newImageSrc resizePreview codepre  pcoderesizePreviewcode uses codeimagePreview.widthcode and code.heightcode to get the dimensions and resizes accordingly. The problem is that the new image isnt loaded by the time coderesizePreviewcode is called so the image is resized according to its original dimensions, not according to the dimensions of the newly loaded image.p  pIf I put an codealertcode call in between the two lines of code it works since the alert gives the browser enough time to load the new image. Apparently I should use an event Is there an existing event, or is there a way I can make one, for when the image src has changed sort of like an onChange event, but for that attribute or for when the new image has completed loading  Thanks for your time.p

Negative 62074 pIm curious to know what are the performance impacts of using HTTP Basic Auth on a webserver like Apache or lighttpd or nginx. I imagine the bottleneck is the actual reading of the file by the server to authenticate a user. It also seems to me that the cost of reading the file to authenticate a user is proportional to the number of users in that file.p  pQuestions i have arebr  1. is there a specific number of users at which basic auth via file starts to fall dramatically or is it linearly relative to the number of users in the filebr  2. Given the stateless nature of http, if a user has been authenticated using HTTP Basic Auth by the webserver on one requestbr   does it simply forward the credentials on every request and the webserver must parse the password file everytime in order to determine if this is a request from a valid userbr  orbr   get something like a token that it uses in the http header on subsequent requests, allowing the server to avoid parsing the password file again p  pthanks in advancep

Negative 62074 pWe all know why Java doesshould not have multiple inheritance. So this is not questioning about what has already been debated tillcowscomehome.p  pThis discusses what we would do when we wish to create a class that has the characteristics of two or more other classes.p  pProbably, most of us would do this to inherit from three classes. For simplicity, I left out the constructor.  p  precodeclass Car extends Vehicle    final public Transport transport   final public Machine machine  codepre  pSo that, Car class directly inherits methods and objects of Vehicle class, but would have to refer to transport and machine explicitly to refer to objects instantiated in Transport and Machine.p  precodeCar car  new Car car.drive  from Vehicle car.transport.isAmphibious  from Transport car.machine.getCO2Footprint  from Machine codepre  pI thought this was a good idea until when I encounter frameworks that require setter and getter methods. For example, the XMLp  precodeltCar amphibiousfalse footPrint1000 modelFordstatic999gt codepre  pwould look for the methods setAmphibious.., setFootPrint.. and setModel... Therefore, I have to project the methods from Transport and Machine classes p  precodeclass Car extends Vehicle    final public Transport transport   final public Machine machine   public void setAmphibiousboolean b     this.transport.setAmphibiousb      public void setFootPrintString fp     this.machine.setFootPrintfp     codepre  pThis is OK, if there were just a few characteristics. Right now, I am trying to adapt all of SmartGWT into GWT UIBinder, especially those classes that are not a GWT widget. There are lots of characteristics to project.p  pWouldnt it be nice if there exists some form of annotation framework that is like thisp  precodeclass Car extends Vehicle projects Transport projectsMachine projects Guzzler     No need to explicitly instantiate Transport, Machine or Guzzler    ....  codepre  pWhere, in case of common names of characteristics exist, the characteristics of Machine would take precedence Guzzlers, and Transports would have precedence over Machines, and Vehicles would have precedence over Transports. The annotation framework would then instantiate Transport, Machine and Guzzler as hidden members of Car and expand to breakout the protectedpublic characteristics, in the precedence dictated by the project annotation sequence, into actual source code or into bytecode. Preferably into bytecode. So that the setFootPrint method is found in both Machine and Guzzler, only that of Machines would be projected.p  pQuestionsp  ol liDont you think this is a good idea to have such a frameworkli liDoes such a framework already exist Tell me wherewhat.li liIs there an eclipse plugin that does itli liIs there a proposal or plan anywhere that you know about such an annotation frameworkli ol  pIt would be wonderful too, if the annotationplugin framework lets me specify that boolean, int, or whatever else needs to be converted from String and does the conversionparsing for me too.p  pPlease advise, somebody. I hope wording of my question was clear enough. Thx.p  pEdited To avoid OO enthusiasts jumping to conclusion, I have renamed the title of this question.p
Negative 62074 pBy the time you finish reading this question, it will become obvious to you that Im pretty new to this development. But Ive got a quick question here. I think I unfortunately, sorta know the answer, but I figured Id ask, anywayp  pIm working on an app in which Id like to display traffic data from Google Maps into a map. Easy enough, it seems. I can easily put the a MKMapView and center it on the desired location. I can also create a custom Google Maps API that I can look at on my browser, and it would display the traffic data with the GTrafficOverlay object.p  pNow...p  pCan I use the API traffic data in Javascript and parse it into the MKMapView implementation I dont think so... rightp  pSo, my only other option is to do a UIWebView instead, right I just link to that page, and Im good to go.p  pAlso... Is there a major drawback to doing that I know I lose a bit of the builtin interface, but beyond that, it doesnt seem to be that huge a difference, rightp  pAnd, also, if I want to use that Google Code API, how do I implement it in place Do I have to have that HTML file somewhere in a server, or can I have it as part of my resources, or whatp  pSorry about all the questions, but thanks in advance for any suggestions yall might have p

Not just a few emails, but actually a lot 10k I have a subscribers list that all agree to it, by the way.p  pAnyway, I cannot send these emails via Gmail or anything like that  They do not allow that many emails to be sent. So the basic question is How do I send emails by making the actual sending computer an email serverp  pIm sure I should use some libraries, I heard about ChillKat or something like that.p  pCould anyone explain  help me out Would be very much appreciated.p

Negative 62074 pFrom the docs p  blockquote   pIn the plain style, section headers   and footers float above the content if   the part of a complete section is   visible. A table view can have an   index that appears as a bar on the   right hand side of the table for   example, a through z. You can   touch a particular label to jump to   the target section.p blockquote  pI find that very hard to grasp. First, this onep  precodeif the part of a complete section is visible codepre  pWhat do they mean by this This is paradox. Which one is itp  pA Table must be exactly the height of that section. If I have 5 Rows, and each row is 50px high, I must make it 550 high. The full section must be visible on the screen. Otherwise, if I have 100 rows but my table view is only 400 high, this will not apply. Nothing will float above my content. Sounds wrong.p  pB It doesnt matter how high my table view actually is. Header and Footer is floating above the content and I can scroll the section. Makes more sense. But is completely against this nonsense making sentence if the part of a complete section is visiblep  pAnd What sense does it make when Section Headers  Footers float above the section content when there are multiple sections with Header  Footer The user would have to scroll to death until reaching the end of first section, until the whole thing can move to the second section Or could she drag the header  footer to move onp  pCan anyone explain it better than they didp

Negative 62074 pI have a JS date that is being converted by Dojo into RFC822 format.

Negative 62074 pWe have a local server with SVN installed on it that we are using for developmenttesting purpouses.

Negative 62074 pIm making a drag and drop engine in JavaScript, and I dont know how to set the correct position of the dragObj because it changes depending on the parent elements positioning type Does the dragObj also change depending on its parents parent element ect..p  pSo, my dragObj looks like thisp  precodefunction makeObjevent      var obj  new Object     var e  event.target      obj.element  e     obj.boundElement  null      whilee  e.parentNode          ife.className.searchbound  ifbound.teste.className              obj.boundElement  e             break                    ifobj.boundElement  null         obj.boundElement  document.body        I would like to find the correct minimum bounds with findPos however, I need      findPos to work with every type of positioning absolute, relatice, ect.      var elemPos  findPosobj.boundElement     obj.minBoundX  elemPos.x     obj.minBoundY  elemPos.y      obj.minBoundX  obj.boundElement.offsetLeft  obj.boundElement.offsetWidth  obj.element.offsetWidth     obj.minBoundY  obj.boundElement.offsetTop  obj.boundElement.offsetHeight  obj.element.offsetHeight      obj.maxBoundX  obj.boundElement.offsetLeft     obj.maxBoundY  obj.boundElement.offsetTop      setHelperBoxPosobj      obj.posX  event.clientX  obj.element.offsetLeft     obj.posY  event.clientY  obj.element.offsetTop      return obj  codepre  pSo, when I make a dragObj, I also set its position and its codebounding elementcode.

Negative 62074 pWell I am trying to do an exercise in my programming book and its difficult for me to grasp exactly what it wants.p  pMy enterAccountData function is suppose to ask the user for an account number and a balance neither of which can be negative and the account number cannot be less than 1000p  pThe second one is the one I am stuck on computeInterest THis function is suppose to accept an integer argument that represents the number of years the account will earn interest. The function then displays the account number from the previous function and displays its ending balance at the end of each year based on the interest rate attached to the BankAccount class. The interest rate on BankAccount has to be a constant static field which is set at 3 percent0.03. p  pSo My question is this How do I set up computeInterest too allow it to calculate the interest using the constant static field when my debugger will not allow me to actually keep the field as a constant I am not trying to stop any random errors from happening for now, just trying to get the jist of what the book is exactly asking for.

But this results not in the desired effect, since the whole App freezes for the specified amount of time. In addition to that i think, that the user wont recognize it as something saying youve reached a special size. Showing guidelines only at the event is not a solution, since the guidelines are shown as soon as the shape is selected.p

Negative 62074 pQuick question, hoping someone can verify. After a fork, if you call codeclose2code in the parent, stderr in the child is unaffected. However, if you call codeclose2code in the child, stderr in the parent is closed. Does that seem right I tested this in FreeBSD and it seems to be the case, but Im not sure why. I would expect that either they both dont affect each other or they do, but not this. p  pAny insightp

Negative 62074 pIm developing a Android board game and have a question regarding creating a board that is zoomable and scrollable. The board contains a static background, characters players and  the actual level which is drawn using tiles.p  pMy solutions is to have a collection of elements tiles, figures, all game elements  all have x,y coordinates and width  height, a camera and a renderer that draws the collection according to cameraX,cameraY, cameraWidth and cameraHeight.

The question is, do their reference counters decrement accordingly when the Button1 object that created them is removed from the display list and nulled out I tested this code and the event listener in the Test class does seem to shut off, but that doesnt necessarily mean that it or the Button2 instance are eligible for GC. Even if they were, it might only be under Mark and Sweep, which is slower than reference countbased GC.p  pOne obvious solution would be to have the Button1 class remove listeners fromnull out references it makes when it is time for it to be removed like sop  precodepackage com.gui       import fl.controls.Button      import flash.display.          public class Button1 extends Sprite            private var button2HandleButton2           private var testerTest           public function Button1                  constructor code                button2Handle  new Button2                tester  new Test                              public function destroyRefs                      button2Handle  null                      tester.removeEventListenerEvent.ENTERFRAME, tester.yellLoudly                      tester  null                           codepre  pbut in a real program, where I may be working with multiple references to the same object from different classes via passing in the original references in constructors wouldnt setting the reference in one class to null cause the value of all other references to the same object to also become null That would certainly be undesirable... p  pstrongThe main question is as follows when the only reference to Button1 is nulled out, do all the the objects it references have their reference counters decremented either immediately or when the Button1 object is garbage collectedstrong p  pAlso, is there a way to view all instances of an object that exist in real time andor their reference count values through the Flash debugger  A detailed profiler like that would really help in figuring these questions out...p  pthanks, CCJp

I was looking for something in photoshop but seems like they used to have something for that but now they dont.  p

Negative 62074 pGot a good question for you guys today. Im working on a drop down slider for mobile devices specifically iOS mobile safari. Ive got quite far with it but hit a brick wall. The problem Ive experienced is heightpositionmargin transitions arent very smooth on a mobile device. So Ive switched over to using transforms as they are buttery smooth on the mobile.p  pI use a container with a child article. The article is translated 120 on the y axis so it is hidden by the containers hidden overflow. Upon tap the article is returned to its original position.p  pThis works great apart form one thing, the container does not collapse when the article is transformed 120 causing whitespace between my drop down sliders p  pMy question is then, how can i work around thisp  pHope you guys can helpp

Negative 62074 pI hope someone is able to help me with what is, at least to me, quite a tricky algorithm.p  h1The Problemh1  pI have a List 1 lt size lt 5, but size unknown until runtime of Lists 1 lt size lt 2 that I need to combine. Here is an example of what I am looking atp  pListOfLists   1, 2,3, 2,3, 4, 2,3 p  pSo, there are 2 stages to what I need to dop  p1. I need to combine the inner lists in such a way that any combination has exactly ONE item from each list, that is, the possible combinations in the result set here would bep  ul li1,2,2,4,2li li1,2,2,4,3li li1,2,3,4,2li li1,2,3,4,3li li1,3,2,4,2li li1,3,2,4,3li li1,3,3,4,2li li1,3,3,4,3li ul  pThe Cartesian Product takes care of this, so stage 1 is done.....now, here comes the twist which I cant figure out  at least I cant figure out a LINQ way of doing it I am still a LINQ noob.p  p2. I now need to filter out any duplicate results from this Cartesian Product. A duplicate in this case constitutes any line in the result set with the same quantity of each distinct list element as another line, that is,p  p1,2,2,4,3 is the same as 1,3,2,4,2p  pbecause each distinct item within the first list occurs the same number of times in both lists 1 occurs once in each list, 2 appears twice in each list, ....p  pThe final result set should therefore look like this...p  ul li1,2,2,4,2li li1,2,2,4,3li li       li li1,2,3,4,3      li li                    li li                       li lili li1,3,3,4,3li ul  pAnother example is the worstcase scenario from a combination point of view where the ListOfLists is 2,3, 2,3, 2,3, 2,3, 2,3, i.e. a list containing inner lists of the maximum size  in this case there would obviously be 32 results in the Cartesian Product resultset, but the pruned resultset that I am trying to get at would just bep  ul li2,2,2,2,2li li2,2,2,2,3  lt all other results with four 2s and one 3 in any order are suppressedli li2,2,2,3,3  lt all other results with three 2s and two 3s are suppressed, etcli li2,2,3,3,3 li li2,3,3,3,3li li3,3,3,3,3li ul  pTo any mathematicallyminded folks out there  I hope you can help. I have actually got a working solution to part 2, but it is a total hack and is computationallyintensive, and I am looking for guidance in finding a more elegant, and efficient LINQ solution to the issue of pruning.p  pThanks for reading.p  ppipp  pSome resources used so far to get the Cartesian Productp  ul lia hrefhttpblogs.msdn.combericlippertarchive20100628computingacartesianproductwithlinq.aspx relnofollowhttpblogs.msdn.combericlippertarchive20100628computingacartesianproductwithlinq.aspxali lia hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions710670cpermutationofanarrayofarraylistsC Permutation of an array of arraylistsali lia hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenusvcsharpaa336800.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenusvcsharpaa336800.aspxali ul  h1UPDATE  The Solutionh1  pApologies for not posting this sooner...see a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma18671046879367belowap
Negative 62074 pIm not a great programmer, to me its just a hobby. I am more interested in desktop programming than web programming. When it comes to making a GUI however, it strikes me how difficult it seems to make a fully customised GUI with effects etc. for desktops, while websites are full of different designs and special effects. Of course, there is a need of consistency between applications on desktop, which somehow isnt needed on the Internet. Yet it seems desktop programmers are bound to using presets of GUI kits Gtk, Qt, Wx etc., and overcoming the former looks like a huge amount of work.p  pSo thats a subjective statement of mine. And thats a very naughty thing to do on a Stack Exchange website. But is this statement somehow justifiable or founded on some technical truthp  pIf not, could you provide with some information NB I work on Linux only.p

Negative 62074 pI have looked a bit around the posts here but it seems there is no such specific question among several related to WPF datagrids, so here it is say I have a DataGrid with 2 templated columns the first includes a combobox and I let it size to fit its content, as this is at most one or two words the second instead includes a textbox where text might become somewhat long. So here I set MaxWidthsomevalue to avoid its width expand beyond the datagrid container, I do the same for its MaxHeight, and set text to wrap. Anyway, Id like the textbox to size its width to fill all the remaining space in the datagrid container if the user shrinks or enlarges the 2nd column, Id like the textbox to shrink or enlarge accordingly so that their width stay in synch. Text will wrap, and scrollbars appear as necessary. Both controls in the grid are bound to a data source in a MVVM scenario.

Negative 62074 pstrongBackgroundstrong I have a production SQL Server 2005 server to which 4 different applications connect and make changes.  There are no foreign keys and in some cases no primary keys. Unfortunately throwing the whole thing out and starting from scratch is not an option. So my solution is to start migrating each of the applications to a service layer approach so that there is only one application directly connecting to the database.p  pHowever there are problems that need to be fixed before that service layer is written and all the applications are migrated over.p  pSo rather than make changes and hope they dont break any one of the 4 badly written applications with no way of quickly testing all functionality my solution is to start auditing the databasep  pstrongProblemstrong How do I audit what stored procedures, tables, columns, views are being accessedupdatedcalled by each user on SQL Server 2005.p  pI can find out which tables are being updated but I have no idea which columns and by what users. I also dont know if certain tables are being accessed only through stored proceduresviews.p  pI know that SQL Server 2008 has better auditing features but if I could do this without spending money that would be great. That said if the best solution is to upgrade or buy software thats also an option.p

Negative 62074 pI dont know if this is something common for people to do or not, but I personally always keep track of the number of times I built my code. That is, both the number of times I called codemakecode and the number of times the build was successful.p  h3My current solutionh3  pI have a simple code that takes a file as parameter, opens it, increments the number inside and overwrites it. This code is compiled, first thing when codemakecode is called.p  pImmediately after, code.increasebuild build.txtcode is called which increments the number of times I called codemakecode to build the library.p  pThen, the code is compiled and the lib file is made with codear cq ...code. After that, code.increasebuild libbuild.txtcode is called that increments the number of successful builds. Finally the tests are built.p  pa hrefhttpsgithub.comShabbyXshCompilerblob1fbc593e8584317861bfacef698cc4da6e4cd9e5Makefile relnofollowThisa is an example of one of my Makefiles.p  h3Why I got concernedh3  pThis always worked fine, until I started using version control. There seemed like there is no problem I am the sole author of my own libraries and I add features one by one.p  pOne day though, I was testing branching and merging I use git for myself and svn at work, so I added one feature in a branch and changed something in master and I merged the two. Now the build count files have different values.p  h3The problemh3  pThe problem is, lets say at the time of branch, the build count is 100. Then I write something in branch and the build count gets to 110. I write something in master branch and the build count gets to 120. When I merge the two, I see one is 110 and one is 120 which is a conflict by the way. The correct solution would be to set the build to 130.p  pHowever, I cant read I dont want to go back to the commit where the branch took off and find that it was 100 so I compute 100110100120100  130 I want this to be automaticp  h3The questionh3  pWell the question is obvious How do I do this How do I keep track of my build count not commit count when Im working with version control I dont want an answer that is based on a feature in the version control, because the problem arises anew if I change version control system.p  pWhat I though could work was to add one line in the build count file for every build, something say with data and time. Then the build number would be the number of lines in the build count files. Also, unless I get two builds on two branches that were done the EXACT same time then merging the files would be just the union of the two.p  pI wonder though, are there any better solutions to this Is what I want build counts even worth the effortp  pP.S. If you are wondering why I do it with both the number of builds and the number of successful builds, thats just something personal. I like to see how much rebuild I get for small typos and errors I make when I code.p  pstrongEditstrong I program in C and C, so a solution in either works for me.p

The branch alters the PC register and may also affect the cache and pipeline, which is pretty minuscule.  For this case in particular, it literally makes no difference because both the codeifelsecode and the codereturncode create the same branch to the end of the function.p

Breaking the image into tiles, then reconstructing them via javascript has merit the user could still dig up the tiles and put them together in Photoshop, but is that practical for them  Thats up for debate.  I was also wandering today if the image couldnt be read, sent as a character string of pixel color values, and then constructed on the client side using an absolutely positioned element for each pixel.p  pBut my potential solutions seem to be getting more and more ridiculously convoluted.

Negative 62074 pIve been trying to write a simple threaded audio captureplayback application using OpenAL as a precursor to attempting a voice chat application.p  pI currently have the Capture amp Write save  playback functions on separate threads and when saving the data to a wav file everything behaves correctly. The problem occurs when trying to play back the data that has been captured.p  pI am attempting to do this a byte at a time, so there is minimal data being passed around. However I get no playback. When I am trying to assign the data from the capture buffer vector to the buffer to be played I get an error of ALINVALIDNAME. I have done some looking around and I believe that this is possibly thread related regarding how the buffer is being written toread from, but Im not 100 sure as what I have found is vague.p  pThe code is given below, and I was wondering if anyone could shed some light on the problem I am having.

Negative 62074 pI am testing an existing application in the Windows 8 consumer preview and it crashes upon launching.

However, the same site has a list of a hrefhttpsocial.technet.microsoft.comwikicontentsarticleswindows7wmiclasseswithmethods.aspxWindows 7 WMI classes and methodsa too, and these arent in that either Even though it works on Windows 7 no problem.p  pSo from the look of that, it is not supported.  p  pThe MSDN for the ManagementClass indicates that the method a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrary15s5468528vvs.11029.aspxis still present in .NET 4.5a.  Additionally, a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopaa38927328vvs.8529.aspxthis Microsoft resourcea does explicitly list Win32Processor and Win32NetworkAdapterConfiguration, with the methods I need.p  pSo, from the links, you can see I have tried to research this, so this is my last stop in trying to solve this mystery.p  pMy app is originally a .NET 2.0 solution created in Visual Studio 2005.  I have installed Visual Studio 2011 Beta into my Windows 8 Consumer Preview VM, along with the latest SQL 2012 Express.  I have tried importing my project into this Visual Studio but it doesnt load it, telling me that it only supports Metro development.  Therefore I cannot debug this issue on the machine itself.p  pSo my question is specifically do these classes exist in Windows 8  If they do, then what am I doing wrong  If they dont, then I need to find out a way to still get this information  but I guess thats a separate question p

Negative 62074 pI just bought a new, machine to run python scripts for large scale modeling. It has two CPUs with 4 cores each Xeon, 2.8GhZ. Each core has hyperthreading enabled for 4 logical cpu cores.p  pNow for the problem When I run identical python processes in 8 separate terminals, codetopcode command shows that each process is taking 100 of the cpu. However, the process in terminal 1 is running about 4 times slower than the process in terminal 8. This seems odd to me...p  pI wonder if it has something to do with how the processes are scheduled on the various logical cores Does anyone have an idea of how I could all of the to run in about the same speedp  pEDIT in response to larsmans Good point. The script is a ginat loop that runs about 10,000 times. Each loop reads in a text file 500 lines and runs some basic calculations on the quantities read in. While the loop runs, it uses about 0.2 of Memory. There is no writing to disk during the loop. I could understand that the read access could be a limiting factor but I am perplexed about the fact that it would be the first process that would be the slowest if that was the case. I would have expected that it would get slower as I start more processes...p  pI timed the processes a couple of times using the codetimecode command in the terminal.p  pEDIT2 I just found out that sometimes a single core is designated to handle all reading and writing  so multiple processes even if they run on separate cores will use one single core for all the IO... This would however only affect one of the cores, not cause all to have various processing speeds...p

Negative 62074   pIve got a bad smell in my code. Perhaps I just need to let it air out for a bit, but right now its bugging me.p  pI need to create three different input files to run three Radiative Transfer Modeling RTM applications, so that I can compare their outputs. This process will be repeated for thousands of sets of inputs, so Im automating it with a python script.p  pId like to store the input parameters as a generic python object that I can pass to three other functions, who will each translate that general object into the specific parameters needed to run the RTM software they are responsible. I think this makes sense, but feel free to criticize my approach.p  pThere are many possible input parameters for each piece of RTM software. Many of them overlap. Most of them are kept at sensible defaults, but should be easily changed.p  pI started with a simple codedictcodep  pre classlangpy prettyprintoverridecodeconfig       dayofyear 138,     timeofday 36000, seconds     solarazimuthangle 73, degrees     solarzenithangle 17, degrees     ...  codepre  pThere are a lot of parameters, and they can be cleanly categorized into groups, so I thought of using codedictcodes within the codedictcodep  pre classlangpy prettyprintoverridecodeconfig       dayofyear 138,     timeofday 36000, seconds     solar          azimuthangle 73, degrees         zenithangle 17, degrees         ...     ,     ...  codepre  pI like that. But there are a lot of redundant properties. The solar azimuth and zenith angles, for example, can be found if the other is known, so why hardcode both So I started looking into pythons builtin a hrefhttpdocs.python.orglibraryfunctions.htmlpropertycodepropertycodea. That lets me do nifty things with the data if I store it as object attributesp  pre classlangpy prettyprintoverridecodeclass Configurationobject     dayofyear  138,     timeofday  36000, seconds     solarazimuthangle  73, degrees     property     def solarzenithangleself         return 90  self.solarazimuthangle     ...  config  Configuration codepre  pBut now Ive lost the structure I had from the second codedictcode example.p  pNote that some of the properties are less trivial than my codesolarzenithanglecode example, and might require access to other attributes outside of the group of attributes it is a part of.

Negative 62074 pI am testing web application behavior with Cucumber using Selenium and Watir under the hood. My web app has HTML5 pages and makes use of the new required attribute. If I have a data entry form with a required field, and I submit that form with the field blank, I would like to verify that the web app correctly responds with an error condition.p  pUnfortunately, when testing using an HTML5 web browser, the error message that pops up on a failed field validation does not appear to be accessible to Cucumber through the web driver. In any case, the form is not submitted and the page remains on the data entry form.p  pOn the other hand, when testing headless or with a nonHTML5compliant browser, the form may submit, allowing my web app to trap the error and send the user back to the form page with an error message.p  pIn the second case, I can easily test for the existence of the error message since its part of the HTML delivered in the page. My problem is that I cant see how to write a single test scenario that will validate the error condition for both headless and HTML5 browser situations.p  pIt may be that this is impossible with the current state of Selenium and Watir web drivers. But if anyone has any idea how I can verify the HTML5 required error popup message, that would be a big help.p  pEDIT 20120602 Here is a sample page with a sampling of HTML5 browser warnings and such a hrefhttprailsdotnext.comstackoverflowrequired.htmlhttprailsdotnext.comstackoverflowrequired.htmlap  pThere is a required text and select, a text box showing internal hint text, and a text box with regex input validation. The page doesnt have any CSS or javascript to confuse the issue, its just vanilla HTML5. See the a hrefhttpwww.w3schools.comhtml5html5formattributes.aspw3schools page about HTML5 field attributesa for a complete breakdown. The form submits to a simple cgi script that just echoes the form input, assuming the form succeeds. A submit failure will remain on the sample form page.p

Negative 62074 p Ive got problem with character encoding of my http responses. I read many tips, tutorials etc., but I cant resolve my problem. We are using Spring MVC with Hibernate and ExtJS as view technology. All data are returns as JSON using ResponseBody on controllers method. Example method p  precodeRequestMappingmethod  RequestMethod.POST, value  dispatcher ResponseBody public String dispatcherPostHttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp, HttpSession session      return processreq, resp, session  codepre  p There is simple dispatching mechanism for dispatching url commands not really important in this case. Process method is doing something with parameters and return JSON. This JSON contains for example data from database PostgreSQL 9.1.4. Data in Postgres are stored in UTF8 and are visible correctly for example in pgAdmin. We can also see valid data from database while debuging in eclipse. It all looks like there is everything ok with getting data from the Postgres. Problem starts when we want to return them via ResponseBody annotated method. Method process returns valid string I can see in debugging mode with utf8 characters but in web browser chrome, firefox there are  instead of polish characters which are stored in database. Looking into firebug I can see that response headers are partially valid Contenttype texthtmlcharsetUTF8. I told partially, because I have this line of code in process method  presp.setContentTypeapplicationjsoncharsetUTF8p where resp is HttpServletResponse. Ive tried adding springs bean post processor from this solution httpstackoverflow.comquestions3616359whosetsresponsecontenttypeinspringmvcresponsebody36175943617594 but it doesnt works.

Negative 62074 pI have created a Dialog Box in a c windows application using ATL lib and I have set on it three buttons. The button lie as usual at the bottom of the Dialog Box. I want by the resize of the Dialog Box, the button to retain their position at the bottom of it.

To bring this into effect, I try to move the buttons accordingly while the Dialog Box size is changed. I use the following code as example only with the OK button, but the only result is the button to disappear during the resize.

Negative 62074 pI am just starting to learn OpenGL today from this tutorial a hrefhttpopenglbook.comthebookhttpopenglbook.comthebookabr I got to chapter 2, where I draw a triangle, and I understand everything everything except VAOs is this acronym OK. The tutorial has this code p  precodeglGenVertexArrays1, ampVaoId glBindVertexArrayVaoId codepre  pWhile I understand that the code is necessary, I have no clue what it does. Although I never use VaoId past this point except to destroy it, the code does not function without it. I am assuming this is because it is required to be bound, but I dont know why. Does this exact code just need to be part of every OpenGL program The tutorial explains VAOs asp  blockquote   pA Vertex Array Object or VAO is an object that describes how the vertex attributes are stored in a Vertex Buffer Object or VBO. This means that the VAO is not the actual object storing the vertex data, but the descriptor of the vertex data. Vertex attributes can be described by the glVertexAttribPointer function and its two sister functions glVertexAttribIPointer and glVertexAttribLPointer, the first of which well explore below.p blockquote  pI dont understand how the VAO describes the vertex attributes. I have not described them in any way. Does it get the information from the glVertexAttribPointer I guess this must be it. Is the VAO simply a destination for the information from glVertexAttribPointerp  pOn a side note, is the tutorial I am following acceptable Is there anything I should watch out for or a better tutorial to followp

Negative 62074 pIn a function parameter that is a pointer foovoid bar, you can use const to specify that either the pointer the parameter itself is constant foovoid  const bar, andor the data that the pointer points to is constant foovoid const bar.p  pHowever in the foovoid const bar case, this is just a guarantee to the caller that foo will not attempt to modify the data pointed to by bar.  It does not give bar any guarantee to foo that the memory location pointed to by bar will always be valid.p  pIn cases where you are working with constant data within an executable image, if you could provide that guarantee to foo and if foo needed to keep a reference that data for longer than the duration of the function call, foo could simply keep a copy of the pointer rather than having to make a copy of the data.p  pIs there a way to encode this guarantee in the C type systemp  pThanks.p

Do commentslikes of a post reorder that post to the frontli liTrack the timestamp of the most recent change in every update, then filter by that in subsequent updates.   This still means I have to iterate over every postcommentlike in the entire feed.li liI read somewhere that postcomment ids increase monotonically.  Is that true per users feed  For comments is that just local to the post  Do postscommentslikes share an id pool so I could rely on this globally   Again not sure about a lot of details here but in that case I could track the highest id seen in one update, and filter on that in subsequent updates.li ul  pAnyway, all these seem very brute force.

This seems to be fairly simple. I think my understanding of whats going on here is solid, and nothing seems to be wrong. Included mostly for context.p  precodepublic class Controller extends JPanel     private Model model      public ControllerModel model          this.model  model         setBorderBorderFactory.createLineBorderColor.GREEN         setLayoutnew GridLayout4,1         addnew RadiusPanelmodel         addnew ColorPanelmodel         addnew SolidPanelmodel         addnew TitlePanelmodel       codepre  pThis is the Controller class. As far as I can tell, the setBorder, setLayout, and series of adds do nothing here. I had them commented out, but this is the way that the instructions told me to do things, so either theres a mistake there or something about my setup is wrong. However, when I did it this way, I would get an empty window JFrame but none of the panels would show up in it. What I did to fix this is put those add functions in the mvcFrame class p  precodepublic class MvcFrame extends JFrame      private Model model      public MvcFrameModel model         this.model  model         setLayoutnew GridLayout4,1         addnew RadiusPanelmodel         addnew ColorPanelmodel         addnew SolidPanelmodel         addnew TitlePanelmodel          addnew Viewmodel           setDefaultCloseOperationJFrame.EXITONCLOSE         setLocationRelativeTonull         setSize800,600         setVisibletrue       codepre  pSo heres where things kind of started getting weird. The first block of commented out code is the same as whats in the Controller class. The reason I have it commented out is because that was just a lucky guess  its not supposed to be like that according to the instructions. However, this did work for getting the panels to show up  but at that point I was still tearing my hair out trying to get the oval to display. p  pThe other commented line  addnew Viewmodel  was a different attempt at making things work. In this case, I put those add functions in the View class see commented out code below. This actually worked to display both the oval and the panels, but that method wouldnt allow me to update the oval. Also, though I just had the oval displaying, I cant seem to figure out what exactly made that happen, and I cant seem to make it come back.p  precodepublic class View extends JPanel private Model model      public ViewModel model          this.model  model         setLayoutnew GridLayout4,1         addnew RadiusPanelmodel         addnew ColorPanelmodel         addnew SolidPanelmodel         addnew TitlePanelmodel          repaint           Override     protected void paintComponentGraphics g         super.paintComponentg          center of view panel, in pixels         int xCenter  getWidth2         int yCenter  getHeight2          int radius  model.getRadius         int xStart  xCenter  radius         int yStart  yCenter  radius         int xWidth  2  radius         int yHeight  2  radius         g.setColormodel.getColor          g.clearRect0, 0, getWidth, getHeight          if model.isSolid             g.fillOvalxStart, yStart, xWidth, yHeight          else              g.drawOvalxStart, yStart, xWidth, yHeight                        codepre  pKinda same idea as before  the commented out code is stuff I added to try to get things working, but is not based on the provided directions. In the case where that stuff was uncommented, I had the addnew Viewmodel line from the mvcFrame line uncommented as well. p  pThe various panel classes SolidPanel, ColorPanel, etc simply extend a class called ControlPanel which extends JPanel. These all seem to work as expected, not having much issue with them. There is also a driver which launches the GUI. This also seems to work as expected.p  pThe main problem Im having is that I cant get the oval to show up, and the one time I could make it show up, none of the options for changing it seemed to work. I feel like Im close but Im just at a loss for other things to try out at this point.p  pAnyone who can help will have my sincerest gratitude.p

Negative 62074 pI am a complete novice and therefore havent been able to find a solution by looking at past posts. I have a geodatabase ESRI ArcMAP, about 70k records with road kill data that was merged from two databases. p  pEx. p  precodeDate, Route, MilePost, Database  1012012, ML34, 113, AnimalVehicle  1022012, ML34, 113.4, Carcasses  1022012, ML16, 86, Carcasses codepre  pI am trying to sort out duplicate records between the two databases. Records with the same codeMilePostcode, codeRoutecode, and codeDatecode have already been removed. The issue is this codeAnimalVehiclecode can record collisions at any time or day of the week, whereas records from the codeCarcassescode database are only recorded during normal business hours. Therefore, duplication arises from carcasses recorded by codeAnimalVehiclecode after hours on a previous day or during weekends. Records are then duplicated by codeCarcassecodes the following morning, or on a Monday or Tuesday in the event of a holiday weekend. Another issue is that codeAnimalVehicle MilePostscode tend to be rounded to the nearest halfmile, whereas codeCarcasses MilePostscode are more precise. p  pThe goal is to build a query or algorithm that returns records paired between the two codeDatabasecode values, so that when codeDatabaseCarcassescode, the query returns records with codeDatabaseAnimalVehiclecode, where the codeMilePostcode is  0.4 of the codeCarcassescode record, and the codeDatecode is within the last four days of the codeCarcassescode record. It would return the first two rows of the example data. p  pAny response is greatly appreciated Thanksp

Negative 62074 psome days ago I downloaded the plugin to repackage apk for BlackBerry then I got a message to update the ADT and SDK so I opened the SDK manager and updated all suggested updates. After I restarted I got a message that a certain project cannot be saved but the gui was empty, no project selected. Today I restarted eclipse and get a message this SDK need an updated ADT 21.0 so I tried to open SDK manager but it said no SDK path has been set. I tried to set The path but it was there already set and no other panel can be opened. I decided to open a manifest from a project and first I got Could not open the editor The editor class could not be instantiated. This usually indicates a missing noarg constructor or that the editors class name was mistyped in plugin.xml. Then all projects have a red x beside. Im not able to understand anything about, I wish someone can help me. Thanks.

Negative 62074 pIm running some code on multiple nodes that each have several CPUs and GPUs.p  pThe CUDA Kernel works in a serial implementation with or without shared memory, assuming I have a square grid size, where the edges are evenly divisible by the block size 16 or 32. The parallel MPICUDA version works as long as I dont try to use shared memory. p  pHowever, for the parallel implementation Im not able to set up perfectly square matrices for each process because of my rowwise decomposition.p  pSay I have a matrix where emnem  20,000 and the total matrix size is emnem2. Assume that I have four MPI processes hosts and four GPUs devices. So that each process gets a chunk of the original emnem by emnem matrix. Matrix size of process 0 for example would be, emnem by emnem4, or 20,000 by 5,000. Where 20,000 is the original width of the matrix and 5,000 is the height of the matrix on each process. I then add one row to the top and one row to the bottom of the 5,000 sized matrix. The resulting height is 5002, and is represented above as the emhem variable.p  pI set up dimGrid and dimBlock I do so in the following way p  precodeint gridheight  h  blocksize  0  h  blocksize  1  h  blocksize int gridwidth  n  blocksize  0  n  blocksize  1  n  blocksize dim3 dimGridgridheight, gridwidth, 1 dim3 dimBlockblocksize, blocksize, 1 codepre  pI then call my CUDA kernel function, and at the top I try declare the shared memoryp  precodeshared int gridsh[blocksize][blocksize] int x  threadIdx.y  blockIdx.y  blockDim.y int y  threadIdx.x  blockIdx.x blockDim.x int gid  y  h  x gridsh[threadIdx.y][threadIdx.x]  dgrid[gid] codepre  pThe problem is that I get slightly different results each time when my block dimensions in total are not the exact size of my grid.p  pIf you need anymore information please let me knowp

Negative 62074 pI currently have a fairly large application written entirely with procedural PHP. I am looking to further my PHP experience and recode a majority of my application using objectoriented techniques.p  pThere are a lot of areas where OOP can help reduce the amount of code and make it easier to read. However, I have a few questions.p  pstrong1strong It is my understanding that one class is used as a blueprint for any number of objects, but any one class represents only one object, never more than one. So one class could represent a player, but never multiple players.p  pstrong2strong Since I will have quite a few different classes to include, do I use a Loader class to load them all using codesplautoloadregistercode or do I just use codesplautoloadregistercode in the program files for my applicationp  pstrongEditstrong So my autoloader would be a class that I then create an instance of to start the autoloading or simply a php file with the function and the splautoloadregister that I would include to avoid repeating the same code in multiple filesp  pstrong3strong Some of my classes depend on other classes. Ive never encountered this before, so I honestly do not know the answer. If I include all the classes in my main program file, but my player class does emnotem include the class which it needs to function, will the player class work since the main program has included the class which player depends onp  pstrongEditstrong So even though one class may instantiate an object of type Player, and the Player class is not directly included by this class, it will still work because the controller class emdoesem include the Player classp  pstrong4strong There are multiple cases where I will need to work on the objects I am creating. I am wondering how I should do that. For example, in my Player class I will sometimes need to send something from one Player to the other Player. So, do I implement a static method in the Player class that takes two Players as parameters and does the transfer or do I do something elsep  pstrongEditstrong Okay, so avoid static methods. Now I have a serious problem I have methods that are ran multiple times in my application, but I cannot implement them as static methods. Am I supposed to implement them as instance methods For example, sending from one Player to another. Would I create an instance method that takes a Player object and sends either emtoem it or emfromem itp  pstrong5strong I have a lot of methods that dont really belong to any one instance of a class nor are they really appropriate as static methods. Should these be declared in their own class as static methods as Common or similar What is the done in practice in this situationp  pstrongEditstrong Would these methods belong in the specific application file for which they are used or perhaps stored in their own functions.php filep  pstrong6strong Id like to learn how to use namespaces, but my code will never be used by others and I will never use anyone elses code in my application. Are namespaces an unncessary addition in my application or would it be a good idea to learn how to use them Regardless, does one application have one namespace the application name or does each class belong to its own namespacep  pstrong7strong Lastly, is it common to have one class for database connections and also a class for network methods My application needs both. I think the main problem I am having with converting my code to use objectoriented techniques is determining which methods to put where, as currently they are all in one monolithic file.p  pThanks for any help and insight you can provide.p
Negative 62074 pIn .NET, I need if possible to distinguish between different types of Japanese number strings.p  pIn Japanese number strings can be written in different ways, e.g for code1code there is code1code, codecode, codecode, codecode in halfwidth characters.p  pI need to compare strings like codeMyString1code and codeMyStringcode, and for obvious reasons they are not equal. I am wondering if there is a way to automatically change codecode type characters to code1code automaticallyp  pEDITp  pI know that the obvious answer would be to make a list of all possible  type characters there is a finite number of those and replace them in the target string. But thats not a very nice way of going about this in my opinion, nor is it very robust... so if there is a generic way Id much rather use that.p  pEDITp  pApologies, I previously wrote that bot codecode and code1code are considered numbers, but they are not. IsNumeric codecode comes up as false. So I guess there might actually be no way at all to switch from one to the other apart from using a straight substitution.p

If it doesnt exist why is Intellisense smart enough to pick it up.  Perhaps thats why it is called INTELLIsense. p  pWhat am I missingp
Negative 62074 pI have a web server with a low latency local, what I wish to do is generate video content from the web server and allow the user to interact with that video content by clicking on the video and the click x,y will go to the server.p  pThe location the user clicked will determine what the video will do. Also the video doesnt pause to wait for a click, it needs to continue to play.p  pI tried with images, to reload a single image every 50 milliseconds. On my MAC here, Chrome uses about 10 CPU usage to reload the image every 50 milliseconds where the image is generated in PHP.

Negative 62074 pHello Android video experts p  pI am developing an Android application which allows the user to capture video and upload it to a remote server its more involved than that but the rest of the app is not important. Because of the upload requirement, it is important that the video is of a reasonable size, so not super high resolution. Lets say a max of 680x480 or 10Mbminute. This is no problem on Apple devices.p  pI have had what can only be described as a complete nightmare trying to capture video at a reasonably low bitrate reliably across a range of Android devices.p  pAs I understand it there are two ways of capturing video on Androidp  p1 Using the Media RecorderCamera APIp  p2 Using an Intent to open the cameras video capture applicationp  pOption 1 gives the most flexibility and allows us to easily change the capture resolution. However the Android Camera API is NOT reliable across a range of devices, and I have very good information including from someone who liaised with Google on this issue that if you capture video using this API then it will crash on a good 50 of the devices out there. There is a reason that Zoom Camera FX uses an Intent for video capture. Zoom Camera different app seems to use Media Recorder, but has lots of bad reviews for video crashing or not working.p  pOption 2 works well across a range of devices, as it uses the in built application on the device. The trouble is you have no control whatsoever on the resolution, there is a quality hint on the Intent but the camera app will normally ignore this. My Samsung Galaxy S3 records video by default at about 2Mbs. This is way too high resolution. The built in application can of course change the resolution, but this relies on action by the user which is difficult to control.p  pI understand that I could use a library such as ffmpeg to change the resolution of the video after capture. However this requires me to compile the library for Android, and also I have been informed that in order to legally use the decodeencode codecs on the device you have to pay license fees that amount to about 1 per copy of the app. Since this app will be free to use, this is not an option.p  pSo thats where Im at. Ive searched long and high for answers, but I cant figure out how to capture low resolution video reliably using Android.p  pAny help very much appreciatedp  pMatthewp

Negative 62074 pI have this form with multiple radio buttons. Exactly 3 inputs per person. I am able to submit and store it to database with ajax and no problems there.

So thats working correctly too when submitting, only right stuff goes to my db. But when I try get info back from that same file with ajax it always says Error  1 per person.

CitySan Francisco To CityFrankfort    Rate is 100 is stored in the system in some form. codepre  pWhen a person ask for the rate from AirportSFO To AirportFRA, the application should look for any rate available from AirportSFO To AirportFRA.p  pAs we dont have onewe only have City to City, the application should check one level higher to Airport which is City. Thus application should be able to find the City of AirportSFO and City of AirportFrankfort and the check whether a rate is available. In this case it picks up 100 as CitySan Francisco to CityFrankfort rate is maintained as 100.p  pHow can I represent this location hierarchy in a data structure In Java Will graph or Tree be useful If so can please provide me some samples.p

Negative 62074 pIve seen many partial answers to this here and elsewhere, but I am very much a novice coder and am hoping for a thorough solution. I have been able to set up recording audio from a laptop mic in Chrome Canary v. 29.x and can, using recorder.js, relatively easily set up recording a .wav file and saving that locally, a lap  pa hrefhttpwebaudiodemos.appspot.comAudioRecorderindex.htmlhttpwebaudiodemos.appspot.comAudioRecorderindex.htmlap  pBut I need to be able to save the file onto a Linux server I have running. Its the actual sending of the blob recorded data to the server and saving it out as a .wav file thats catching me up.

Negative 62074 pI have currently implemented a 3D noise function in GLSL which is used to displace the vertices of a sphere to give terrain. I am currently using the geometry shader to simply calculate perface normals I have tessellation too, hence why I am doing this here instead of the vertex shader. Now I would like to calculate pervertex normals.p  pNow I have seen a few posts about calculating normals from noise when displacing a flat grid but cant seem to get it working for myself. Below is a snippet from my tessellation evaluation shader which calculates the position of the new vertex. This works fine. p  precode Get the position of the newly created vert and push onto spheres surface. tePosition  normalizepoint0  point1  point2  Radius   Get the noise val at given location. Using fractional brownian motion float noiseVal  fBMtePosition, Octaves    Push out vertex by noise amount, adjust for amplitude desired. tePosition  tePosition  normalizetePosition  noiseVal  Amplitude  codepre  pcodetePositioncode then goes into the geometry shader where three of them are used to calculate the surface normal of the triangle.  How would I go about using this to then calculate the normal for said vertexp  pI have attempted to do the neighbour method by resampling the noise at two small offsets from codetePositioncode I push these back onto the sphere before displacing them by the noise value. Then using these two new positions, I get the vector from tePosition to each of them and use the cross product to get a normal. However this results in many areas being black suggesting the normal is backwards and the parts where the normals are facing outwards seem to be quite uniform around the sphere illumination on opposite side of light. Heres the code that does the abovep  precode theta used for small offset float theta  0.000001   Calculate two new position on the sphere. vec3 tangent  tePosition  vec3theta, 0.0, 0.0 tangent  normalizetangent  Radius vec3 bitangent  tePosition  vec30.0, theta, 0.0 bitangent  normalizebitangent  Radius    Displace new positions by noise, then calculate vector from tePosition float tanNoise  fBMtangent, Octaves  Amplitude tangent  normalizetangent  tanNoise tangent  tangent  tePosition  float bitanNoise  fBMbitangent, Octaves  Amplitude bitangent  normalizebitangent  bitanNoise bitangent  bitangent  tePosition  vec3 norm  normalizecrossnormalizetangent, normalizebitangent codepre  pI have tried varying the codethetacode value and changing how this is used to offset, which results in varying degrees of wrongness. p  pDoes anybody have any ideas as to how I can calculate the normals correctly p

If so, wouldp  precodeLockerNodep  new LockerNodee, p codepre  pequivalently place it before Is the use or absence of the next member of the node what defines the placement location, or is it something entirely differentp  pHope someone can clear my doubts, and sorry if it seem a foolish question Thanksp

Negative 62074 pI am building a set of programs that consist of multiple clients and a single server.p  pThe clients are frequently pushing small packets of data to the server, which will validate the information returning an error if the data is invalid, and process the received information. The information may then incur the firing of events, which clients will be subscribed to, allowing for clients to be instantly or as close as possible notified along with a small amount of data.p  pI have some ideas about how to do this, but I am trying to avoid creating a protocol of my own, mainly as Im sure it would take forever and I would probably make a few errors. So I was wondering if there are any existing protocols that I could implement into my system that would provide such functionality.p  pThe number of clients will initially be quite small, but will be growing over time to potentially include 1000s of clients with their own subscriptions, and several front end servers each one handling a subset of subscriptions parsing the information back and forth with back end servers for improved capability.p  pSo, if anyone knows of any existing protocols that implement these requirements and functionality, that would be fantastic.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pI am currently looking at the XMPP protocol, and the JXTA protocol suite for reference, and implement with another language. Both seem quite good and provide the necessary connectivity, but I have not had the opportunity to test each of them out in my environment, or if they are even suitable for what I am attempting.p  pAdditionally, some of the network clients will be outside of the local network and operating over WAN. Security is not so much of an issue, but I need to take into account the increase latency of this, and firewall rules local to the connection that is hosting the application and ISP firewalls that could be blocking certain ports or transport protocols I have read some text that said that some ISPs where blocking UDP packets, but not sure of how wide this goes. I can do it at home, the office, mobile, friends houses, etc and have yet to experience it myself.p

Negative 62074 pIve been selling apps in Google Play for 3 years. I found out that the sales amount in Google Wallet doesnt match with the amount that I received. The amount shown in Business insights for All time is 30 more than what I received. I wondered why I received 30 less so I reported that to the Google. Google checkout team said they need to investigate but they secretly changed my record without notifying me. I kept emailing to them about the issue but they kept changing the representative and they finally advised that the issue happened because some orders are double counted. When I ask them for the double count detail for a specific month to see how the double count occurred, they refused to give the detail to me.p  pIf you are also a developer who sells app in Google Play, I advise you check the sales amount in Business insights to see if you have the same issue as me.p  pIf the answer is yes, I advise you to do the following.p  ol liGo to Google Wallet, click the Business insights, check the sales amount for all time, capture a screen shot.li liIn the Business insights, export the revenue for All time.li liGo to Payouts, go to Reports tab and download the monthly record by pressing the down arrow icon.li ol  pYou need to save these documents in a save place and it is better that you saved multiple copies in the USB thumb drives.p  pThen you can start emailing to Google about the issue. I hope the above procedures will help you to preserve some evidence before Google made the change on your record without notifying you.p  pIf you are unfortunate as me, please email to me and we can unite together to find out the answer.p

Negative 62074 pI am wondering why there is no .ToShortDateString in a .NET Portable Class Library. I have 2 projects Silverlight, and regular .NET Class Library that use the same code, and the code involves calling .ToShortDateString on a DateTime object. In order to reuse the same code instead of copying it in 2 places, I created a portable class library so it can be imported by both Silverlight and .NET Class Library. Unfortunately, it doesnt seem like .ToShortDateString is available when using the class library. I can accept a string parameter in the portable class library method and pass the .ToShortDateString value from both silverlight and class library projects, but I am wondering why this method isnt native for the portable library. Is it a culture issuep  pThanksp  pMishap

Negative 62074 pStackfolks,p  pIve got a troubling issue.  Im writing a macro that allows a user to select and work with a workbook that is already open.  After obtaining the name from the user through a user form, when I try to set the workbook, or interact with it otherwise, I get a subscript out of range error.  I have confirmed the workbook is open, and that the ExcelAp object is connecting to the right instance of excel.  Here is the relevant codep  precodeOption Explicit  ....

Negative 62074 pI am prototyping usage of SQL Server Service Broker to process queued items. Thus far things are going well. p  pOne thing that I would like to do is to be able to process several items from the queue in parallel on different processes or threads, but limit processing so that a particular user can only have one item processed at a time, to prevent one overzealous user from starving out all others.p  pThe processing on parallel threads is easy. The limiting per user is not so straightforward. Initially I thought I could set the conversation group id to the id of the user, and therefore have processing of the group be serialized automatically by the service broker. At this point, I have not found a way to implement this option successfully.p  pIs this something that can be done with conversation groups Is there a simpler way with or without the service broker Am I going to have to take care of it outside of the service brokerp  pI have done quite a bit of research, but its all starting to run together, so apologies if I missed something obvious.p
Negative 62074 pIm making a text based dice roller. It takes in strings like 2d105 and returns a string as a result of the rolls.

This is incorrect. li ul  pIn the fourth and fifth example, something strange is causing an extra empty string to appear at the front of the array. Its not the lack of number at the front of the string, as other examples disprove that. Its not the presence of the percentage sign, nor the the plus sign. p  pFor now Im just continuing through the for loop on blank strings, but that feels sorta like a bandaid solution.

Negative 62074 pI have a site that is using IIS 7.5 it is also using ISAPI rewrite.

This is causing problems because I am trying to use ISAPI rewrite to rewrite the URL based on the part number.

I went to the folder to see if any folder in the directory path is locked and also to see who has read and write permissions. It is not me but the system. I did a Disk Permission Repair in Disk Utility but that didnt help. p  pI then removed the offending file .itmstransporter. and tried to submit but got a different error. I put it back and took out the other two ITMSTransporter.cmd and WOBootstrap.jar but produced a different error.

Ive found the only way it works is to have it as an array as defined above.  I also want to note that there could be many more config file options presented than in my example.p  pI am not sure what is the better approach  importing the variables to be declared correctly what I would like to do, or assuming they cannot be imported as anything other than a string and then parsing that string into the proper variable types after.p  pI have tried declaring the variables before hand and using the SetVariable command to set the values, but that doesnt work. It very much seems like my variables are being imported with GetContent as strings from the start instead of the correct types. p  pFull script is here a hrefhttpsgist.github.comTnTBass4692f2a00fade7887ce4 relnofollowhttpsgist.github.comTnTBass4692f2a00fade7887ce4ap

Some are simple  like AccountCode and Department. Others are more complex, like the personal data, job, and leave accrual. Some are realtime, others are scheduled, and others are batch e.g. at payroll runs.p  pRegardless, we have to get source data out of PeopleSoft database  and my hope had been to let the source database do the heavy lifting by executing SQL Queries.

Negative 62074 pWe have made a primary storage heap memory manager that overrides the codenewcode and codedeletecode operators, there is a problem however since we need to initiate the memory manager embeforeem any other memory allocations happends  if we dont do this then the process will contain some unmanaged memory. The solution so far is to initiate the memory manager in the same file that has the codemaincode function, like sop  precode brief Start the memory manager.  note Its important that this is causing the very first call to the overridden new operator.

Negative 62074 pI need to calculate a CCITT 16 bit checksum value for data passed as a parameter together with the length. If I fill my array TempStr with the test data 123456789, use the polynomial 0x8408 with the length excluding the null termination character, I get the result string 6E90Hex. Together with the null termination char I get 907A. When I swap out the polynomial to 0x1201 then I get results 29E2Hex and EFE8Hex with and without termination character.p  pMy questions are  Do I need to calculate the CRC with or without the null termination character to obtain the correct value Do I use the polynomial 0x1201 or the reverse polynomial 0x8408 in the algorithm Is the correct CRC of the given data 0x29B1 I need the correct value to determine if the function works correctly..

What we want to query for is all reservations that start on a given date e.g. today.p  pThe relevant query fragment isp  precodereservations.startonDate  COALESCEcurrenttimestamp at time zone properties.timezone, currenttimestampDate codepre  pThe properties table is joined earlier in the query as you would expect.p  pThe problem is, as you probably guessed, timezones.  We cant simply ask for codestarton  datecode because when we say codedatecode we really mean date in that propertys codetimezonecode which may not actually be codedatecode based on the current time.  codedatecode will come in as, e.g. code472014code based on the timezone of our App server but we actually want to include reservations that start on code482014code if the reservations property is in Sydney Australia.p  p EDIT p  pSome additional information.p  preservations.starton is stored as type codedatecode.p  pproperties.timezone is stored as codecharacter varying255, default AmericaLosAngelescharacter varying.codep  pThe reservations starton date is stored as the date were you in the timezone of the property.  The part that needs to be interpreted is the date we are querying for to shift it to the appropriate date in the various property timezones in most cases.p  pIm certainly open to other approaches but this was all I could think to do so far... Basically I want to be able to ask a few questions of the DBp  ol liWhat reservations are starting todayli liWhat reservations have start dates in the futureli liWhat reservations have start dates in the pastli ol  pStart date, being a date though, is obviously actually a time range so you cant just say codestarton gt nowcode for example because timezones.p  pTable Definitions a hrefhttpsgist.github.comanonymous10295380 relnofollowhttpsgist.github.comanonymous10295380ap  p EDIT 2 p  pI tried switching over to using tsrange for starton.  The range is time shifted from the propertys timezone to UTC.  That means a starton of 4112014 in Sydney is stored as code[4102014 140000, 4112014 135959]code.  I have a gist index on the tsrange version of the starton column.p  pThis seems to work perfectly and return the right results.  It uses the gist index for  queries with a specific time and is blazing fast.  Unfortunately it is NOT using the gist index for all range operations...p  pHere is a gist haha with example EXPLAINs on some of our queries a hrefhttpsgist.github.combdmac10496601 relnofollowhttpsgist.github.combdmac10496601ap  pThe column shown in the examples, codearrivaldaycode is equivalent to codestartoncode but is a tsrange.  I have not removed the old codestartoncode column yet.p  pSome of the queries that are now slow are upcoming or past reservations where I had to construct a tsrange with no upper or lower bound depending.  I cant seem to figure out how to do a query with ltlt or  that accepts an element instead of a range like you can do with p

Lets say that you have a canvas with around 100 buffered geometries with around 72000 vertices  geometry. The only way I know to do this is that you get the positions of the buffered geometries and then put them into the kdtree to determine the nearest vertice and go from there.

Negative 62074 pIm looking to achieve something that seems quite simple, but I cant figure out how to do it. I call overLIB tooltips using onMouseover, on both Macbook Pro and iPad. Obviously, however, though the onMouseout event makes the tooltip disappear on my Macbook Pro, it fails to do so on iPad  nor, I expect, on iPhone nor any touch screen. In other words, the tooltips become sticky, but I want them to go away when the mouse leaves the element.p  pHere is Eric Bostrups overLib code as extended by Foteos Macride, as well as Macrides filter extension, which causes the tooltip to fade in and out. Both work beautifully on my brand new Macbook Pro with Mavericksp  blockquote precodeltscript typetextjavascript src..overlibmws.jsgtltscriptgt  ltscript typetextjavascript src..overlibmwsfilter.jsgtltscriptgt  lta hrefjavascriptvoid0 onmouseoverreturn overlib , WIDTH, 434, HEIGHT, 660, BACKGROUND, image.jpg, RIGHT, OFFSETX, 20, codepre      pPADX, 0, 0, PADY, 0, 0 onmouseoutreturn ndp blockquote  pI have been searching for hours for a solution and cannot seem to find a satisfactory one. For example, I am not interested in requiring a tap like onClick on the linked element to make the tooltip disappear  sometimes the tooltip is very large, containing an image, and it might cover the thumbnail. Id much rather use something like touchmove or whatever its current incarnation is Im not a code maven, just something of a dabbler, so I dont actually even know how to use this.p  pIve found some discussion about mouseenter and mouseleave, but apparently these do not work particularly well on Safari in iOS, and I also dont know what their effect would be on the laptop version of the tooltips. Finally, Im not sure how to substitute those events for the original mouse events in the code.p  pWhat would be ideal is for is for the tooltip to disappear once my finger leaves the tapped element that fired the mouseover event.p  pThanks for any help. I hope Ive given enough info. If not, please feel free to ask if anyone would like to see the .js files, for example.p
Negative 62074 pI am working on a project where I am using ISroll 5 to show some html code that needs to scroll, placed over parts of images.  Another part of the project has a button that when clicked shows a slide show of the imageshtml described above using Fancybox 2.p  pThe IScroll works fine when just showing the imagehtml.  However, when I try to show the same imagehtml in Fancybox  using a different IScroll instance and code source  the scrollbar and scrolling are lost.p  pIn searching for solutions, I found a post that suggested IScroll needed to be refreshed after Fancybox dislays.  The reason given is because IScroll needs to get the container size that is initially unavailable with Fancybox starting with a display none.  So the suggested fix was the followingp  precodeaboutbutton.fancybox     onComplete function           myiscroll.refresh       codepre  pThe onComplete function has been replaced in the newer version of IScroll 5 with afterLoad.  Given that, I tried the same thing using afterLoad instead with no luck.  Much later, after trying several other ways with no luck, I decided to post.p  pI created a scaled down version of my project for illustration of the problem.

Negative 62074 pWe have encountered an unexpected limitation of less than the documented maximum 500 characters for the video tags property, both when entering Tags directly into the YouTube UI interactively or when using the Data API v3 video resource snippet object. p  pWe are using the YouTube Data API v3 to interact with YouTube from an ASP.Net C web application, which uses the Google APIs Client Library for .NET. p  pDuring testing we have noticed that 500 characters are supported for exclusively single keyword Tags, but when there are any spaces encountered within the keywords, such as for peoples names for example, each space appears to have an overhead and the 500 character limit is unexpectedly exceeded as a result.p  pThe YouTube documentation states that Tags should be up to a maximum length of 500 characters, and that the Tags field contains a comma separated list and commas between items in the list and spaces within Tags between the commas count towards the limit.p  pThere is no mention of exactly how spaces are handled though, yet a single whitespace character seems to count towards the overall field size as more than a single nonwhitespace character, effectively reducing the length of Tags that can be supported unexpectedly when spaces are involved.p  pCould anyone please advise regarding the aforementioned issuep

Ive even tried to use codeSprite Kitcode in a AppKit based app for its a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosdocumentationGraphicsAnimationConceptualSpriteKitPGPhysicsPhysics.html relnofollowphysics simulationa, but I couldnt find a way to remove the annoying grey background in codeSKViewcode even when Ive set codebackgroundcode to codeSKColor.clearColorcode.p  pSo, I wonder if adding gravity is really that hard Is there any best practices Ive found some apps, like codePixelmatorcode, integrated some cool gravity features, so I guess thats possible Can anyone help me out of here Big thanksp  pA small discussion with the release of OS X 10.10, Apple is abandoning skeuomorphism, so is it still a good idea in design to add physics simulation in your app Like the rope effect in Pixelmator appp
Negative 62074 pMy homework is remove duplicates in a random string. My idea is use 2 loops to solve the problem.p  p1st one will scan every character in the string. 2nd one will check that character is duplicated or not.

Negative 62074 pI have an InnoDB database with one table, embookem. In addition, I have a PHP script which contains one single query, to display the number of books in such embookem tablep  precodeSELECT COUNT FROM book codepre  pAs you know, with the emmysqliem extension, it is possible to create a transaction with emmysqlibegintransactionem. Next, the isolation level can be defined.p  pIn my case, I dont need transactions related functions, and I use emmysqliqueryem, because its only a single SELECT query. However, I know that even a single query is wrapped under a transaction with MySQL, and the default isolation level is REPEATABLE READ.p  pThe problem is here I dont want REPEATABLE READ overhead for just executing such single query. READ UNCOMMITTED is enough.p  pQuestion is the mysqliextension autodetect that Im using a single SELECT query because I dont begin any transaction and automatically set the isolation level to READ UNCOMMITTED or at most READ COMMITED or do I need to define a wrap class to always set READ UNCOMMITTED isolation level before executing such transactionwithonlyoneSELECTquery p  pThank you very much.p

Negative 62074 pI have an SQLite database containing several tables, two of which have over a million rows. Im using Python 2.7 on OSX and the SQLite3 module.p  pI tried to read all the data from the tables into memory with a codeSELECTcode statement without codeWHEREcode or anything of that nature using the cursors codeexecutecode method, followed by its codefetchallcode method. An hour later I decided to interrupt the process because I couldnt tell whether it had crashed. So I tried again using the cursor as an iterator and telling it to print the number of seconds elapsed every 10000 rows retrieved.p  pI found that while this method could retrieve the whole of a 150000 row table in about 6 seconds, with a 2500000 row table, it takes about 40 seconds per 10000 rows to begin with 60 seconds for some of the earliest batches, accelerating to about 20 seconds per 10000 rows from the millionth row onwards. So my question is why is this happening, and whats a good solution to or workaround for it An obvious workaround would be to break up large tables into smaller ones or to give up on SQLite entirely and use something else but thats not really very elegant.p  pMany other questions on Stack Overflow relate to slow read performance with relatively complex queries in SQLite e.g. a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10014262sqliteselectexpressionisveryslowSQLite  select expression is very slowa. But this question relates to the simplest possible kind of query, e.g. codeSELECT a,b,c,d FROM xcode.p  pIve given the OS, programming language, and wrapper that Im using above, but Im not sure how relevant they are to the problem. For example, if I try to inspect these large tables using the Firefox extension, SQLite Manager, Firefox just seems to hang. Ive also tried switching to the apsw wrapper a hrefhttpsgithub.comrogerbinnsapsw relnofollowhttpsgithub.comrogerbinnsapswa but there was no improvement. p

Now if it keeps all the current devices synced together thats bonus, but emnotem a requirement.p  pstrongWhat is the best way to do thisstrongp  pIve looked at backup agent, but that seems to be only semisupported on some devices and looks like if you were going to from say a verizon device to a say sprint device you would just lose everything but I may be misunderstanding how it works.p  pIve also been looking at google drive through play services, but despite the docs making it sound like I could just get access to the appFolder and just movestore everything there, in practice I cant seem to find a simple way to do this. Do I really have to loop over every single file manually uploading it I can do this if this is the best solution, but I thought before I put 1215hours of work into it it would be best to ask here if thats my best solution.p  pThanks for any inputp  pstrongTLDRstrongp  pWhats the simplest cloud backup solution that isnt network dependent and doesnt require anything more then a google account for the end user p

Negative 62074 pI have a client running into some 500 errors when using a CDN. These errors indicate that there are too many internal redirects, and our research confirms that. The client does not want to adjust their internal redirects, and wants to address this problem in another way.p  pBased on my research so far, this seems like a hard cap which is not specific to any one type of web server, and is in place to avoid endless loops. That being said, is there any way to raise this limit  for instance to 20 instead of 10p  pExamplebr 1 Browser 9 redirects Origin 200 page 9 redirects total br 2 Browser 9 redirects Origin gives custom 404 page 1 redirect for custom 404  10 redirects total br 3 Browser  CDN 1 redirect from custom rule 9 redirects Origin 200 page 10 redirects total br 4 Browser  CDN 1 redirect from custom rule 9 redirects Origin gives custom 404 page 1 redirect for custom 404  11 redirects totalp  pOnly example 4 gives a 500 error. Without adjusting the redirect configuration or removing the CDN, is there any way to get around this Unfortunately, I cannot provide htaccess for more info on the redirects, my apologies.p

Negative 62074 pstrongNEW INFORMATIONstrongbr I used the codeprintrcode function on the codeREQUESTcode and something very strange is happening there too. Some values are being correctly passed by the GET such as a value on another form which passes in TRUE. This can be seen in the codeprintrcode output but isnt written to the file... Still no closer to finding a solution to my problem however.p  pIm working on a page with a lot of forms which are loaded in as needed by AJAX. This all works fine as does parsing the namevalue pairs and storing them appropriately.p  pMy error happens when the PHP parses the GET request sent by AJAX when the user is finished, it only seems to retrieve the values from certain fields.p  pThe idea is that the user can add data from any number of forms, which are then turned into a GET request and sent to the server.p  pThe JavaScript is building my request perfectly and all forms are sent correctly.p  pDepending on the forms the user submits, the data is processed by a large switch statement which passes the relevant names to a variadic function which grabs the values, and creates a string for writing to a file.p  pThe strange error is that only some values get written to the file with others only having a blank line. No error reported by Apache or PHP, no error reported in the JavaScript console either.p  pIll use the Colour form for example as this is one of the more complex.p  pSo I add a colour action and click the button to submit all forms this time, its just the colour form thoughp  pMy get request looks like this codeactionIDsColourampcoOptionSelectTintingampcoColourEffectSepiaampcoRemoveColour000000ampcoRemoveFuzzNumber0ampcoRemoveHueSelectNoneampcoReplaceColour000000ampcoReplaceFuzzNumber0ampcoReplacementColour000000ampcoReplacementAlphaNumber0ampcoReplaceHueSelectNoneampcoReplacementHueSelectNonecodep  pNext, the PHP parses the actionIDs part as sometimes, there will be many actions. This works fine.p  pWe now jump to the Colour part of the switch statement.p  precodecase Colour     config  processActioncoOptionSelect, coColourEffect, coRemoveColour, coRemoveFuzzNumber, coRemoveHueSelect, coReplaceColour, coReplaceFuzzNumber, coReplacementColour, coReplacementAlphaNumber, coReplaceHueSelect, coReplacementHueSelect     fileputcontentsconfpath . colour.conf, config     break codepre  pThat writes to the correct file, but strangely, only codecoOptionsSelectcode and codecoColourEffectcode have their values written to the file. It isnt their input type as they are select statements similar to the other selects on the form. On other forms, it may be a number input or a text input that submits properly instead.p  pIt isnt random either, the same ones will always write out properly. It also isnt positional as I moved around the values and its still the same ones that write correctly, their position doesnt affect anything.p  pFinally here is processAction function.p  precodefunction processAction      config        foreachfuncgetargs as field              temp  issetREQUEST[field]  REQUEST[field]  null         config  config . temp . n            return config  codepre  pThe end result should be all values should write to their relevant files correctly, rather than the current issue where only a few values from each form are written, with the rest of the values being written as blank lines.p

Negative 62074 pSo my current app uses UIAlertView in a few places and upon updating to iOS 8 I saw the notes in the documentation once saying that UIAlertView and UIActionSheet had been deprecated since iOS 8 and replaced with UIAlertController. I added it to my todo list and have just started to tackle refactoring my code over to use the new UIAlertController class.p  pI can see how everything works with the UIAlertController though Im left with a few use cases of UIAlertView which I dont seem to easily be able to replace with UIAlertController. This all stems from the fact that [UIAlertView show] was callable as is to display an alertView, where as the UIAlertController must be presented from another viewController using the presentViewController method. The problem is that I have a number of calls to create alertViews that are coming from code not directly linked to a particular viewController, Im going to have to refactor and pass through viewController params to each calling point to be able to use the UIAlertControllers. Before I do this I wondered if anyone knew of a nice way to get back the ability to just display the UIAlertController without knowing a suitable ViewController at the time. Is there a way to get the current view controller from somethingp  pIve also implemented a debug alert view macro which lets me put up error messages within alert views, these can obviously be called from anywhere and unlike actual app functionality providing alertViews I really dont want to have to refactor ViewControllers throughout all my code just to use them. p  pIts a little frustrating that whilst deprecating some systems theyve not provided functionality that allows the replacement system to be used in the same way as the original functionality.p  pAny help appreciatedp

Negative 62074 pwe are in process of designing new web services for our project. Our project has about 100 tables and data in millions. We have two designs for web services.p  pFirst one is design four generic web services as the followingp  ol lipublic String createEntityEntity,transactionId  returns transactionIdli lipublic String deleteEntityEntity,transactionId returns transactionIdli lipublic String updateEntityEntity,transactionId returns transactionIdli lipublic int commitEntitytransactionId  returns 0 if success,  0 if failed. li ol  pIf a consumer wants to add 1 record, update 1 record and delete 1 records from a Entity Table DEPARTMENT, consumer would call, first three web services. When first web service is called with empty transactionId, web service would create a unique transactionId and cache the request in the memory. And subsequent requests would be cached and associated with that transactionId until consumer sends a commitEntity with that transactionId. At this point server would commit all changes for that transaction to the database. p  pUpside of this design is that it is very generic and we can handle any data. We do not need to change the web services when we add new tables or new columns. Downside is that these are too generic and does not give specific information about requests and responses.p  pSecond design is to have specific web services which is more traditional way, such asp  ol lipublic DepartmentResponse saveDepartmentsDepartmentRequest  this can save all department changesadddeleteupdates in one webservice.li lipublic EmployeeResponse saveEmployeesEmployeeRequestli ol  pUpside is that these are specific services and provide clear information on what each services do. Downside is that these are rigid. When we need to add a table or column, we will need to make changes to services.p  pI have to suggest which option to take and I appreciate if you can provide any suggestions on which approach is better and why so. p

Theres obviously no data binding like Angular, and its great to be able to use the Virtual DOM to update the page based on changing serverside data...But stronghow can React be used to update data on the serverstrong Im not looking for a tutorial.p  pIn jQuery ajax, I can push data to the server without doing a page refresh. Can I do this using React All of the examples are cute hey, I can click this counter button and a number increments hey, I can add a comment via this input and its rendered on the page, but how is this data then saved on the backend Is persistent data a thing without a page refresh Im failing to see what is gained by using React for this use case, over jQuery for example.p  pIm probably missing something simple, and a simple answer would be greatly appreciated. p

Negative 62074 pIm researching Hadoops metadata capabilities before our implementation of Hadoop. The term Hadoop Metadata seems to have multiple meanings.  Ill list three understandings that I have about the term.

Basically stuff so Hadoop knows what data is where. Does not seem like this is all that valuable as a metadata consumer although necessary.li listrongFile metadatastrong  From the file system shell.  Where I can get permissions numberofreplicas userid groupid filesize modificationdate modificationtime filenameli listrongHCatalogstrong  Incomplete understanding Stores the schemas, or tables, information that was made by users via things like Hive and Pig.  Then I have schemalike metadata similar, howbeit limited, to say database metadata.li ol  pSo metadata in Hadoop seems a little fragmented to me.  I dont think I care what blocks are where for name node metadata.  But is there enough metadata somewhere in Hadoop to answer question like What data is in Hadoop What uses what data When did the data get in Hadoopp  pTo summarize my question What useful metadata information does Hadoop have for metadata consuming purposesp  pThanks.p

Negative 62074 pWe use the v3 Google Analytics iOS SDK. We are currently using googles automatic session management in production. Every screen on the app is tracked. My average session time is 25 minutes. Session time is skewed either very low or very high. 30 of sessions are 010 seconds and 60 are 181 seconds.p  pGoogles documentation says that they count each screen view, even if the user comes back to the same screen after the app is in the background.  I verified that is true based on testing in a controlled environment. First I added manual session tracking to the app using a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions25286706googleanalyticsreducedsessiontrackingafterv3sdkupdate2688202426882024thisa. I opened the app for the first time in a brand new Google Analytics appid at 1236pm. Then I put it in the background. Then opened it again and backgrounded it again. After 15 minutes I had a correct session count of 2 and a screen count of two. Then I removed the manual session counting and did two more sessions at 1255pm. After about 10 minutes, my session count was 3 and my screen count was an accurate 4. The session count with the automatic tracking seemed to be off by one, but on the low side. Given this test, I cant understand whats going on in production.p  pLogically, each session necessarily requires at least one screen view. So how could the session count be greater than the screen count in production What Im seeing is that the session count is about double the screen count. How could this bep
Negative 62074 pI am coding a program which has an entire codeJPanelcode zoomed in with a codeJScrollPanecode as a map, but I also want to give users a scaled amp minimized view of the whole map in the corner of the codeJScrollPanecode. I am using BlueJ, amp in BlueJ, at least I have basically gotten what I want. To scale down the map, I create a single codeBufferedImagecode, codebicode, that is the size of the minimap, then take its codeGraphicscode object, codegcode, convert it to a codeGraphics2Dcode object, codeg2code, then give codeg2code a single set of codeRenderingHintscode, throughp  precodeg2.setRenderingHintsnew RenderingHintsRenderingHints.KEYANTIALIASING,             RenderingHints.VALUEANTIALIASON codepre  pFrom there, I use the codeGraphics.scaledouble sx, double sycode method on codeg2code to set the scale so that upon calling the codepaintGraphics gcode method of the large map with codeg2code as its parameter, it will draw a scaled version of the large map on codebicode that is the exact size of the minimap. This happens 20 times per second somewhat arbitrary, at that speed I think it looks best. The minimap reflects what the user is doing in realtime amp I think it looks laggy if done fewer than 20 times per second.p  pOn my Macbook Pro, The resulting look of this code isp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com91m18.png altenter image description here brThere is no noticeable lag with this code when I run the program, which has led me to keep the picture resampling at 20 times per second, since there appears to be plenty of CPU for this.

Negative 62074 pI worked on upgrading the app to iOS 8 and shifted Xcode 5 to Xcode 6 for iPhone 6 and 6 plus devices. The app work fine in iPhone 6 and 6 plus. But when creating new app in Xcode 6 same thing doesnt happen. I tried using constraints but that is not easy to handle things. I want to know is that the only way to work on Xcode 6 for making all devices compatible app because more complex design the more difficult to handle constraints. Is there any other way other than storyboard. Or any other smarter way to do this with some less complexity. Please guide.p

Negative 62074 pI was hoping to get some clarification as it relates to custom elements and their lifecycle callbacksp  ol lipI have some confusion with the element created callback.  The spec says something like called when each instance of an element is created.  to my thinking, an instance is inserted into the dom virtually right after it is created, and so the benefit of having these two callback essentially back to back in the document flow.  I have also read online that the created callback is more closely related to the element becoming defined.  Which of these cases is what the spec says.pli lipThis is probably along the lines of the previous question  I see 3 ways of a custom element making it into a documentp  ol lipIt is part of the document from the beginning.  In this case, in relation to the document.readyState events, when will the definition be registeredpli lipIt is inserted via javascript.  I assume that the programmer will register the definition prior to creation and insertion.  Then, the question is when does the created callback fire  When does the attached callback fire Lastly, if I setup other elements to interact with my element when it is inserted, when can I be sure that that work is finishedpli lipThe last method I can think of relates to the shadow dom, and the sense that an element is somewhat half in and half out of the document.pli olli ol  pThank you for reading, I would appreciate any clarification and edification you might be able to provide.p
Negative 62074 pI am currently planning to create a browsergame in NodeJS. The Game will use events for basicly every communication between the modules.p  h2What is more performant or has advantages or disadvantagesh2  pI use only one global EventEmitter. Every module can listen to that global event stream or emit events in the global event stream. I would use more complex eventnames, so when an event is fired, not all listeners on the global event stream are called. I have a really high amount of listeners on one single event stream.p  pExample Player1 receives an item. The event player1inventoryitem is fired, and only player1 listens on that event on the global event stream.p  h2ORh2  pEvery module on its own extends the events.EventEmitter and provides only the events for that specific object. The number of listeners on every EventEmitter is very low, most of the time there is only one listener.p  pExample A single player has a questlog and an inventory. For every player I create an instance of questlog and inventory, hold them in a collection or the player object. The questlog of player1 ONLY listens on the inventory of player1.p  hr  pI dont have experience with the EventEmitter in NodeJS and only know that there is a warning when there are more that 10 listeners on one eventemitter or event because of memory leaks, but I dont know why.p  pI see some advantages and disadvantages on both systems, but on the technical side I need advice.p  pThanks for every helpp

Negative 62074 pIm working with a lot of rank data that would benefit from a way to simultaneously display its respective year on the xaxis.

At first I thought it would be necessary to provide input data of the form shown in Table Ap  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comCLLVl.png altenter image description herep  pHowever such input is a major deviation from the existing Dygraph parser model who expects one abscissa. Such suggests that a modification to the parser to accept a Dual Label option, requiring that both labels be contained in a single abscissa element as in Table B, would be easier. Thereafter, with the option specified, the parser would manage CSV as it usually would with the exception that it is now bin cognizant and detects division between labels 1 and 2 by use of an acceptable delimiter in this case a single quotation mark  maybe not the best choice and divisions between label 1 abscissa elements by name change. Behind the scenes each point gets its unique x coordinate and the Dual Label option causes the dygraph to visually scoot up a couple pixels to accommodate an extra label. Not sure how to handle full zoomed scrolling put simply leaving a label 1 element centered until an adjacent label 1 element comes on screen is an option.p  pcodeDygraphs rulecodep

Negative 62074 pI have successfully built a Java web application using TFSs java support via ant. My problem is that I have several applications that share a common build process and would like to reuse the build.xml with parameters passed in to differentiate the output, however, the TFS Build Definition does not allow me to reference a build.xml file that is in a shared location outside of the workspace mapping for my particular build.p  pFor example, assuming the following Version Control structurep  pSourcebr nbspnbspApplicationsbr nbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspApplication 1br nbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspMainbr nbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspsrcbr nbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspWebContentbr nbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspApplication 2br nbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspMainbr nbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspsrcbr nbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspWebContent  p  pFor each build definition I would like root to be that of the Main branch of that application so that only those source files are copied to the build server. I would like the build.xml to be stored in, say, Applications directory as it will be shared across Application 1 and Application 2. When I try this I get the following errorp  pCProgram Files x86MSBuildMicrosoftVisualStudiov10.0BuildExtensionsMicrosoft.TeamFoundation.Build.Extensions.Ant.targets 306 There is no working folder mapping for SourceApplicationsbuild.xmlp  pThis is because my Source Control Folder in the build definition is set to a child folder Main. If I set my Source Control Folder to be the Applications folder, I believe it will work, however, I then notice that the build attempts to transfer ALL files under Applications to the build server which slows the build down to a crawl. Any thoughts on how I can achieve the desired reuse Perhaps something in the TFSBuild.proj file that would restrict the files that get transferred using a parameter ApplicationNameMain or something like thatp  pThanks in advance for any assistance.p

Negative 62074 pIm trying to change the title of my codeInterface Controllercode programmatically at one point during the apps lifecycle. p  pHowever, this doesnt seem to be working when the app is running.. Is that intentional, a bug, or am I doing something wrongp  pemExplanationemp  pThe way Ive set it up is with a title strongaastrong in Storyboard. Then in codeawakeWithContextcode I check for a variable in the codeUser Defaultscode, which determines what state to set up the codeInterface Controllercode for. In one case I change the title to strongyystrong, in the other I change it to strongxxstrong through calling one of two setup methods codesetUpForShowingcodecodesetUpForCreatingcode. p  pAt some point the user will press a button, which displays a codemodal viewcode. Right before that view is displayed, I call the opposite setup method, changing the state of the codeInterface Controllercode. Everything on the screen is changed correctly, so I know the correct method is called. However, the title strongdoes not updatestrong. p  pHave anyone experienced something similar p

Negative 62074 p1 This probably was asked a lot before, and I have read quite a lot about codeSleepcode vs codeWaitForSingleObjectcode, but still a little bit confused. As an example I have a simple background thread which is called from dataprocessing thread to show some message to the user without blocking dataprocessing thread. Which, in terms of performance CPU usage  CPU time is better in this case a hrefhttppastebin.comVuhfZUEg relnofollowhttppastebin.comVuhfZUEga or a hrefhttppastebin.comeciK92ze relnofollowhttppastebin.comeciK92zea I suspect that the shorter codeSleepcode time is and the more flags I have, the worse performance is. On other hand with longer codeSleepcode time performance will be better but reaction delay will increase, and with a lot of threads reaction delay will eventually become noticeable for user on lowend machine. Is that correct So what is the best way to keep the dormant, inactive threadsp  p2 Is codeSetEventcode blocking codeSendMessagecode or nonblocking codePostMessagecodep  p3 In codeTForm.OnCreatecode event I have a following code p  precodeprocedure TFormSubsystem.FormCreateSender TObject begin   Application.OnExceptionLogApplicationException   Application.OnActivateInitiateApplication end  procedure TFormSubsystem.LogApplicationExceptionSender TObject E Exception var   ErrorFile TextFile   ErrorInfo String begin   AssignFileErrorFile, AppPathError.log   if FileExistsAppPathError.log then     AppendErrorFile   else     RewriteErrorFile      ErrorInfoDateTimeToStrNow Unhandled exception     if AssignedSender then       ErrorInfoErrorInfo in Sender.UnitNamegtSender.ClassName     ErrorInfoErrorInfo E.Message    try     WriteLnErrorFile, ErrorInfo   finally     CloseFileErrorFile   end end codepre  pIts not the best way to log errors, but its simple.

Negative 62074 pI have a UserData script in python in an AWS Launch Configuration thats associated with an AutoScale group. When new ubuntu instances are spun up this script is run on them to do whatever setup is needed.p  pUntil now, I had the security groups configured more loosely. Outbound traffic to anywhere on the internet was allowed from these instances. The UserData script was working fine. But I just shut down that outbound rule to increase security. Now that UserData script randomly wont execute at all or sometimes when it does execute, it fails. I can see this by examining the codevarlogcloudinitoutput.logcode file. Has anyone seen this behavior Any suggested solutionsp  pWhen the script fails, I can tell that it is failing on certain Boto calls that do network discovery such as codeboto.vpc.VPCConnection.getallvpcscode. It seems reasonable that this would fail if the outbound traffic rules prevent it from querying for this information.

Any idea why it does not connect to the other server I blame some local properties file that take precedence over the properties specified, but havent found any yey sas.client.props does not contain any hostport info. With SOAP connector it works perfectly fine. p  pbUPDATEb When the two servers are on different machines, so HOST property is different, it really connects there. The user still must exist on both machines within the same REALM. So the problem is when the two completely independent processes one hosting the client application and the one to connect to reside on the same host, then it connects to the local process  PORT property pointing to the other process is ignored. p

Negative 62074 pI am trying to set the navigation bars codetitleViewcode to a rounded image. Similar to profile images you generally see in messaging applications. p  pI believe I should be able to create a rounded scaled down image by doing the following p  precodeUIImageView profileImageView  [[UIImageView alloc] initWithImagelogoImage] [profileImageView setFrameCGRectMake0, 0, 30, 30]  profileImageView.contentMode  UIViewContentModeScaleAspectFit  XXX contentMode commented out because enabling it causes the rounded corners to have no effect profileImageView.layer.cornerRadius  15 profileImageView.layer.masksToBounds  YES profileImageView.clipsToBounds  YES self.navigationItem.titleView  profileImageView codepre  pThis appears to create the image I desire for a split second when I load the emulator, but the image appears in the top left corner of the screen and then immediately snaps to the center of the navigation bar. Once at the center of the navigation bar it rescales to take up the entire space of the navigation bar instead of remaining as a small circle. What I missing It seems like I must need to disable what ever mechanism is causing my image to scale up to fill the entire navigation bar.  p

Negative 62074 pMy application involves storing data in multiple GBs spread across different sections only few of which need to be loaded into memory at any moment.I am trying to minimize the memory usage in my application by using boostfilemapping  boostmappedregion. Storing these sections into normals files would have been fine, but I wanted better fetching performanceemI have read that memory mapped files do help in that. Is this trueemp  pI create multiple file mappingseach of a fixed size 512MBMy sections are not going to be that large...50 MB max and keep pushing the data from the sections into the mapped file once they are populated and necessary processing has been done on them. p  pWhen the application is build as a 64 bit binary, I am able to work without problems for data in the region of 15GB. But when built as a 32 bit binary, after readingand putting into file mapping around 1.7 GB datasplit across 4 memory mapped files of 512 MB, the mapped region creation starts failing with erroroutofmemory. p  pInitially I used to dump all my data into a single memory mapped file, and had encountered a similar problem. At that time I assumed that because of the limit on the addressable memory in 32 bit, I was getting errors because the addressessizes used were getting too large1.7GB ish...So I thought splitting the mapped file into multiple files of 512MB should fix the problem. Here are the questions that I havep  ul lipIn spite of splitting the memory mapped file into multiple smaller mapped files, I am not able to work with large data when my application is build as a 32 bit binary.pli lipBecause of file mapping, the peak memory usage for my application remains very low. But the system memory usage keeps increasing and comes down once my application is closedall memory mapped files are removed. So is the OS behind the scenes still keeping things in memory, just that it doesnt show up in my application memory footprintpli ul  pstrongNOTE 1 strong If my binary is built in 64 bit mode, I am able to work with a single large memory mapped file as well as a collection of smaller memory mapped files.p  pstrongNOTE 2 strong System config  i53570, 8GB, Win7 SP1 64 bit, NvDia GT610, 250 GB free on diskp

Negative 62074 pBasically, a continue from left off system... kinda like any game has. So far the idea I got going is to save the certain variables into a text file like name, health, xp, etc. and have a location variable that determines where the player is in the game and will act as the continue from left off. Is there a simpler way about going about doing thisp

The primary key will be a Hash and Rage where the Hash  ItemID and Range  AttributeID. Have a global secondary index, Hash and Range where Hash AttributeID and Range  ItemID.pli lipSame thing as above but with SQL, though this will result in about 9 million entries which will be slow for performance, especially as I add more AttributeIDs.pli ol  pIs my solution okay or what is a better way of doing it With the way Im suggesting, would there be any difference in performance between an SQL and DynamoDB version due to underlying table implementationsp
Negative 62074 pI have a emPDFViewerem module in my project, depending on an android library module emlibPDFem. The native code is included in the library module in the codejnicode folder along with appropriate android code. I am using Gradle experimental 0.3.0alpha4 same problem with 0.2.0 and 0.2.1. There are native files from libraries outside of codejnicode folder  they are included using codeandroid.sourcescode and their headers with codeCFlagscode in codeandroid.ndkcode. The library is compiled into a .so file and included in the apk.p  pThe project compiles and runs using a default debug native configuration for emPDFViewerem, the debugger is started with a warningp  blockquote   pAttention No symbol directories found  please check your native   debug configuration.p blockquote  pWhen debugging no breakpoints in the native code and java code are hit. If I pause the debugger the execution is in a function called codeepollwaitcode.p  pI dont know if this matters but in Android Studio 1.3.2 I getp  blockquote   pThrowable LLDB server not foundp blockquote  pin the Event Log. If I try with GDB it throws an exception too. Im building only armaebiv7a version. In the given samples I dont see any special gradle code to include debug info for the native code. Or am I missing something p  pDo I need to add symbol directories myself from the native configuration options What are these directories and how to find them The example samples dont show this warning when debugging and there are no symbol directories set in their native configuration options.p  pcodedebuggablecode, codejniDebuggablecode, codendk.debuggablecode flags are set to true, codeandroiddebuggable  truecode is in the manifest, codeCFlags  gcode is in the codendkcode block, none of these work.p  pAny ideas Thanks in advance.p
