Positive 53 pI have a Maven WAR project, managed under Eclipse using codem2ecode and codem2ewtpcode. In my codepom.xmlcode, I configure the codemavenwarplugincode to filter some resources in codesrcmainresourcescode, and to put them in the classpath.p  pMy files are correctly filtered, both in codeprojecttargetfinalnameWEBINFclassescode and in codeprojecttargetm2ewtpwebresourcesWEBINFclassescode. However, when I run my webapp using codeJ2EE Previewcode, the values are read unfiltered. p  pAfter investigating, I discovered that the files read, in my webapp launched on the codeJ2EE Previewcode server, were located in codeWORKSPACE.metadata.pluginsorg.eclipse.wst.server.coretmp0projectWEBINFclassescode, and that they were unfiltered. p  pSo it seems that codem2ewtpcode is correctly doing his job here, but that the server adapter somehow messes up the filtering. It seems to acquire the unfiltered resources directly from codesrcmainresourcescode, to put them in the code.metadatacode dir, instead of acquiring them from codeprojecttargetcode. p  pHow could I make sure that the server adapter acquires the filtered resourcesp

Positive 53 pI have a project A that I am using for two purposes one as a library, and as a Eclipse plugin project that gives more support for the library.  I have other projects e.g. project B which want to use the library and so add project A to its build path through EclipseConfigure Build Path.  Ive done this many times before I added the plugin nature to project A.  It worked as expected.p  pBut now, If I run classes in project B as Java Application or JUnit Test, they hang as soon as they attempt to put up a window JFrame or JDialog.  Its deep in native code.  The debugger saysp  precodeCGLGraphicsConfig.getCGLConfigInfoint, int, int line not available [native method]    codepre  pThis happens even if the code in the class doesnt use anything in project A. Project B has some main classes that need project A and others which dont.  If I remove project A from project Bs build path, then the classes that still compile can run fine, put up JDialogs, JFrames.p  pThis is on MacOSX Yosemite running Java 7 or Java 8.  It was happening with Juno, and I upgraded to Kepler and then to Luna, with no success.  Still everything hangs.p  pI think that there must be something about a plugin project that puts something dangerous on the build path.  I tried putting project A at the very bottom below the JRE put it still causes this behavior.p  pIm guessing that I could work around the problem by separating the project A into two parts, but thats annoying.p

Positive 53 pI have recently discovered that you can connect the strongEclipse Task Liststrong with GitHub directly thus allowing a nice synchronization between a selected repository and what your are doing in the IDE related to that repository taskwise. Im using strongEclipse Mars 4.5.0strong.p  pI have created a GitHub Task Query you can see my settings belowp  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comqaNd3.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comqaNd3.png altGitHub task query settingsap  pAt first I was able to create two issues that also appeared on GitHub. Both issue were however placed in a folder in the Task List interface saying strongUnmatched Automatic container for repository tasks not matched by any querystrong. Weird...But since today things got even worse  all tasks I create are placed in the strongUnsubmittedstrong folder. This makes perfect sense with one exception  whenever I try to submit the task I getp  blockquote   blockquote     pSubmit failed Unexpected error Requires authentificationp   blockquote blockquote  pSo basically after two tasks I can no longer even submit anything. Upon creating a task I make sure I select the task query I have selected for my repository. Also the idea of all this task synchronization is supposed to be bidirectional right When I create a task in the strongEclipse Task Liststrong I expect that it will be displayed on the repositories strongIssues page on GitHubstrong and the other way around  when someone creates an issue on that same page it should appear in my task list. This is at least my understanding of synchronization. The task query doesnt show any issue whatsoever. Validating it returns that everything is perfectly fine. Pressing on the synchronization button even though I have enabled automatic synchronization also doesnt return any errors.p  pAm I missing something or this is one of the buggiest plugins for Eclipsep

Negative 53 pI have a web site running via IIS7 on Vista. The site is running on port 88, so a hrefhttplocalhost88httplocalhost88a should render the default HomeIndex view. p  pThis works correctly, as do all other views. p  pHowever, one problem is resident. My script paths point to Scripts[FILE] and my CSS paths point to Content[FILE]. My assumption was that the Content or Scripts folder would always be at the root of the site as I have no intention to run this site in a virtual directory setting. Whenever the pages render, they have NO CSS or script So everything looks wonky and the scripting obviously doesnt work, hence a lot of the views dont work either. p  pThis is a very odd problem, one that Im sure is a result of my lack of knowledge hosting things under IIS7. Id appreciate any help anyone could offer. Thanks a lotp

The effect it has for the user is that it looks like they incorrectly logged in except w no message telling them that.p  pIt does seem to come in spurts, as in the system will be fine for a while, and then Ill see it happen to a user 45 times in a row.

Needless to say the system didnt scale and was  deeply flawed and unstable. But it was a big and very complex system and thus the cost of redeveloping it was prohibitive. My brief at the time was to try to refactor the codebase to impose proper decoupling between the components.p  pAt the time I tried to using some kind of abstraction mechanism to allow me to intercept all calls to the static resource and redirect them to a component that would properly manage the state data.

Whats here is actually an equation that is supposed to be used to determine monthly payment if interest rate,principal, and number of payments is known. It is using brute force and looping at most 100 times until the calculated payment equals the desired payment. It arrives at an answer usually after about 4050 loops and that could be optimized by reducing significant digits.p  pSeems to me if we just solved for interestRate there would be no looping. Try as I might, I cant get the equation to solve for I, so thats my main question.p  pNow, if you understand the problem well enough and know financial formulas and compounding interest, you might provide me with an even better solution altogether, which would be awesome.

Negative 53 pMy question is on how to preserve data during the redirect when using the PRG Pattern on my forms.  Specifically, Im wanting to use this in an ecommerce application.  I have three options of storing the data over the redirect, and I have concerns with each.  Im hoping you guys may be able to help me work through this issuep  h31.  Store Data in URL Stringh3  pI can store the data as an encrypted string passed in the URL.  This is great in that I dont have to store credit card information, but my worry is that and maybe Im wrong Google Analytics might cause the credit card information, though encypted, to be indexed and show up in search results.  Hopefully I am wrong in this concern and can use this method, since its the easiest.p  h32.  Store Data in Sessionsh3  pI could store the data in a session, but Im worried some users wont be able to use sessions because of cookies being disabled, which would limit the usefulness of the application.  Additionally, I would be storing encrypted credit card information in the session and PCI Compliance says that I am not allowed to store the CVV under any circumstances.p  h33.  Store Data in Databaseh3  pI could store the data in a database, which would solve the compatibility concern I have with sessions  but Im still left with the problem of not being allowed to store CVV numbers under any circumstances.p  pIt seems that passing information through the URL is the best method when using the PRG pattern.  Im just worried that Google Analytics in the page might index the query string in the URL.  Even though the query would be an encrypted and unreadable form of the credit card information, I still wouldnt want that to show up on anything.  Hopefully I am incorrect in thinking Analytics would store and index that information.p  pPlease advise, thanks for your help.p

Negative 53 pIve had a long standing interest in developing an OS UI tailored to my needs and interests. When I was younger, I went crazy playing with the Stardock skinning tools for Windows. I loved developing my own window styles and layout ideas. Since then Ive had an unscratchable itch.p  ul liIm not particularly interested in fiddling with the lower level kernel operations, just the presentational aspects. Ive been considering some flavor of Linux. li liWhile I would love to have some basic integrated toolsapplications that I create myself, Im primarily interested in the presentations of basic windowing, toolbars, desktop, and file management.li liI dont want to be locked out from using existing applications, if possible. I, for example, have no interest in writing my own web browser, but having the ability to work existing tools into a design would be a major plus.li liMy ideas are sometimes very visual in nature, so the ability to produce more complex transparency effects and unusual window shapes would be useful. Moreorless the ability to reproduce the graphic fidelity of current UI designs for OS X or Windows would be ideal.li liAn OS flavor and tools that lets me start with a blank screen and work from the ground up or include basics are encouraged. The idea of a desktop in the traditional sense shouldnt be mandatory. Flexibility to do different things is important to me.li ul  pemWhat Im looking foremp  pIm interested in what LinuxOS flavors might make sense, what tools  frameworks would be useful for accomplishing the task  Qt seems to be a popular suggestion here , and basic info on how  where one might start developing  testing such a UI.

Negative 53 pI have a sql query a join that is superfast when run on Oracle SQL Developer milliseconds but superslow minutes when same query is called from a c app using ODP.net. The call to OracleDataAdapter.Filldata table just waits for oracle. What is strange is that previously the join was superfast in c as well.p  pThe queryp  precodeselect t1.col2, t1.col3 from table1 t1 where exists select t2.col2, t2.col3 from table2 t2 where t1.col2  t2.col2 and t1.col3  t2.col3 codepre  pAfter some investigation I realized the only change made was the addition of an existing timestamp column as part of the primary key for both table1 and table2.p  pBasically table1s PK looks like this ColTS was added to PKp  precodeCol1 varchar2, Col2 varchar2, Col3 number, Col4 number, ColTS timestamp codepre  pAnd table2s PK ColTS was added to PKp  precodeCol1 varchar2, Col2 varchar2, Col3 number, ColTS timestamp codepre  pBut the thing is, I am not using the timestamp columns in my join at all I am just joining table1 Col2 to table2 Col2 and table1 Col3 to table3 Col3. Why does the addition of timestamp as part of PK impact the query call from Cp  pAdditional notes the only indexes for both tables are the PKs. Should I add an index for the timestamp columns Running Oracle 10g, .Net 4.p  pAny insight into the issue is much appreciated.p

Negative 53 pIm trying to use methods to pass values from text fields in one view to corresponding text fields in another view.

These strings are then passed to the changeValues method of the areaViewController. The areaViewControllers changeValues method is identical to the volumeViewControllers method, other than the text field names being different. However, the NSLog commands that I have never show anything in the console, so its obvious that despite my text fields being connected to the action, it is not being called. What do I need to fixp  pThe warning is given after the method call [areaViewController changeValueswidth length radius], and it reads UIViewController may not respond to changeValuesp

Negative 53 pI know this will probably be considered a duplicate, but looking through the questions I could find, I didnt quite find answersp  hr  pI develop web sites on a Mac, and I obviously need to test them in all sorts of versions of Internet Explorer. Especially since a lot of my work is purely clientside coding, so services like browsershots.org dont cut it. Besides, I run a web stack locally on my machine, which I need access to.p  pIve so far had a pretty messy setup using multiple virtual machines in VMWare, with different versions of Windows and IE. It works, but its just not elegant or easily maintainable. Plus, its just a pain to boot all those virtual boxes.p  pSo Id like to get Windows 7, just use that, and get rid of the other versions and VPCs. As I understand it, I can then use a hrefhttpwww.microsoft.comdownloadsendetails.aspxFamilyId21EABB90958F4B64B5F173D0A413C8EFampdisplaylangen relnofollowMicrosofts IE VHDimagesa to check sites in all the different versions of IE.p  pIs this a good solution Or should I rather skip Windows altogether and use something like a hrefhttpwinebottler.kronenberg.org relnofollowWinebottlera. Or is there a way to just run the timelimited VHDs from a Macp  pIf it is a good solution, I have another question Being a Macuser, I dont know what edition of Windows 7 I need for it. Home Premium Professional Ultimate I dont need emanythingem from Windows except being able to test in IE 6 unfortunately and upwards, so I just need the least I can get by with.p  pAlso, its a little unclear what the requirements for the VHDs are. The site says its XP, Vista or 7, but I imagine that running VHDs is the kind of thing that wont work on every edition.p  pLastly, Ive so far simply edited the hostsfile for each virtual Windows install to get it to reach my Macs web stack. Will I need to do something similar for each VHD, or are there simpler solutions Those VHDs are set to expire pretty quickly it seems.p

Negative 53 pWe have some EDI files coming in to our BizTalk server that we drop off on a file share for processing by an end system.

Negative 53 pIs it possible to use the NSLocalizedString infrastructure based on localizable.strings with a customdefined localizationp  pThe thing is, there are some languages that have different wordings for males and females.

I can do it with my own code but Id rather do it the easy way if possible.p
Negative 53 pI have a thirdparty library that requires an assembly A to be loaded when I call into their code. That assembly is typically installed in the GAC, so I have several options to load itp  ol liI can explicitly call codeAssembly.Loadcode. However that requires the full name which I dont feel comfortable to hard code in my program. li liI can explicitly call codeAssembly.LoadWithPartialNamecode. That is an obsolete API of course, and of course I dont feel comfortable to lose control in versioning.li liI can reference the assembly in my Visual Studio project file, so I always get the version I built against. However, that wont work unless I create a dummy object in that assembly. The C compiler simply ignores it if I dont.li liSame problem if I call codeAssembly.GetReferencedAssembliescode and force load the matched one. The C compiler simply wont reference my assembly even if I put it in the references list.li ol  pNow what Im doing is to call codetypeofA.Foo.Assembly.GetNamecode and ignore the return value. Is there a better way to do itp

Negative 53 pstrongUsingstrong InfoPath 2003 and its XML, Microsoft SQL Server 2005, Visual Studio 2005, C to make a web servicep  pIve been trying to find something that does this already, and either my Google skills are failing or its not actually possible, because I cant believe this hasnt already been needed by someone.p  pI am attempting to make a web service that takes an InfoPath form, gets the list of all the fields from the form and their associated expected data types if the user bothered with validation, and creates a table in a SQL database with the same fields and expected types probably using varchar as a default type where validation wasnt used.

Before I drive myself crazy trying to make everything work, I need to know is this possible  I know XML documents are basically made of userdefined tags, and I dont know if theres any way to distinguish form fields from any other tags associated with rendering the document properly.

Negative 53 pI am doing writing code for PhD research and starting to use Scala.  I often have to do text processing.  I am used to Python, whose yield statement is extremely useful for implementing complex iterators over large, often irregularly structured text files.  Similar constructs exist in other languages e.g. C, for good reason.p  pYes I know there have been previous threads on this.  But they look like hackedup or at least badly explained solutions that dont clearly work well and often have unclear limitations.  I would like to write code something like thisp  precodeimport generator.  def yieldvaluesfileString     generate      for x lt Source.fromFilefile.getLines         Scala is already using the yield keyword.       givesomething       for field lt .r.splitx          if field contains             for subfield lt .r.splitfield  givesubfield           else             Scala has no continue.

BTW give should be named yield but Scala has taken that keyword already.p  pI gather that, for reasons I dont understand, Scala continuations may not work inside a for statement.  If so, generate should supply an equivalent function that works as close as possible to a for statement, because iterator code with yield almost inevitably sits inside a for loop.p  pPlease, I would prefer not to get any of the following answersp  ol liyield sucks, continuations are better. Yes, in general you can do more with continuations.  But they are hella hard to understand, and 99 of the time an iterator is all you want or need.  If Scala provides lots of powerful tools but theyre too hard to use in practice, the language wont succeed.li liThis is a duplicate. Please see my comments above.li liYou should rewrite your code using streams, continuations, recursion, etc. etc. Please see 1.  I will also add, technically you dont need for loops either.  For that matter, technically you can do absolutely everything you ever need using a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiSKIcombinatorcalculusSKI combinatorsa.li liYour function is too long.  Break it up into smaller pieces and you wont need yield. Youd have to do this in production code, anyway. First, you wont need yield is doubtful in any case.  Second, this isnt production code.  Third, for text processing like this, very often, breaking the function into smaller pieces  especially when the language strongforcesstrong you to do this because it lacks the useful constructs  only makes the code emharderem to understand.li liRewrite your code with a function passed in. Technically, yes you can do this.  But the result is no longer an iterator, and chaining iterators is much nicer than chaining functions.  In general, a language should not force me to write in an unnatural style  certainly, the Scala creators believe this in general, since they provide shitloads of syntactic sugar.li liRewrite your code in this, that, or the other way, or some other cool, awesome way I just thought of.li ol  pSorry for the sarcasm in the previous list, but these are typical responses Ive seen to similar Scala questions on Stack Overflow.p  pThanks for any help.p

Negative 53 pI was just playing around with the Altivec extension on a power6 cluster we have.

Negative 53 pThis is more of a theoretical question and i think the best way would be to start from an example. p  pLets say that I have a rating system. Every user can rate any item once and every item can be rated by any user only one time. I want to present some history of every users ratings all the items he rated, the rating, time etc.p  pMy way of solving this would be to have a table like thisp  precoderatingid  userid  itemid  rating  date codepre  pThis table store every rating and some other needed data. In this case, if there are 10k users and 10k items the table would be a very long one and in addition to that I would be needing to use some JOINs to find out the name of the user and the name of the items he rated. So Im guessing that would take a lot of time.p  pAm I on the right path or is there a better solution to my problemp

As I am creating folders within folders and so on.. There must be some legitimated way to do it.p  pThere was problem with string which I now saving in hidden label so its not a problem anymore.   p
Negative 53 pIm making a script to create a username. It should be four letters long traditionally weve used 3 letters of the last name  1 of the first name.br If it was already used we manually thought of an alternative.p  pSo if my name is Fred Flinstones we should try FLIF. If this doesnt work we loop through the name FLIA, FLIB, FLIC ... FLIZ, FLAA, FLAB, FLAC, ... FLZZ, FAAA, FAAB, ...p  pThe easiest way is to loop through last letters then make another set of loops through second last letter and loop through last letters then a set of loops through third last, second last, last and fourththirdsecondlast. This makes a lot of do while loops nested in eachother  unreadable for other humans  a lot of typing.br I could use a counter per letter but that also doesnt seem elegant I could try with one counter and then using codemod 26code to see how many letters need replacement but that seems very complex.  p  pIs there some elegantefficient ways to do this  p  pbrBonus points for first trying to keep the string as logically correct as possible f.e. keeping the last letter an F for Fred or skipping letters FLIF FLNF, FLSF, FLTF, ... .p

Negative 53 pI am working on a collaborative project in Java, and thought it would be easiest to have it as an applet embedded in a webpage, and then everyone can add their child classes of bonuses, enemies, etc as they make them into the respective folders. And to make this work, I wanted the applet to check the folders on the website, gather the names of the files in each folder, and then put those names of the classes into an array as theyd each be randomly generated from this.p  pI originally tried making a File object and calling .listFiles to get it into an array, but the file object would not recognize the path I gave it, codegetCodeBase.toStringbonus.txtcode, so I tried just putting the names of all of the classes that would be in a folder in a .txt file, opening the file, and just reading each line. This would work in eclipse, but when I uploaded the .class and .txt files to the website,  I got a permissions error, so i put the class into a .jar, self signed it and uploaded it again but the applet would not work, it just froze.br Any time I did not have a file retreval statement, in or out of a .jar, the applet would work just fine, but if I had those lines of code it would freeze or give an error.p  pIve tried codenew scannernew filebonus.txtcode different variations of buffered readers found through google of similar issues, as well as different ways of loading the address through File class, but none of them have worked.p  pAll I have been trying to get the applet to do this far is just load a .txt file in the same directory as the .class file, read the contents and print them in the applet, with no success. Much appreciated if you could point me in the right direction.p

Negative 53 pIn c  c local objects are created on the stack, and data is fed from the stack to the cpu registers. p  pIn Java there is no stack, all objects are allocated on the heap, now for prewritten code the size needed for objects can be calculated and instead of having an overkill c c style per object heap allocation entire code blocks are laid down at once. This way Javas heap performance is almost as good and virtually comparable to that of the stack in c c.p  pMy question is how does the program flow from the heap to end up being executedp  pLets assume I run a function that copies the program code into memory, after the program is in the heap memory, and returns the program entry point address, how do I initiate its executionp

Negative 53 pIm looking for any ideas on how to implement tranches in objected oriented programming, e.g. in Python. p  pIll give a simple example of what Im trying to accomplish.p  pA plant produces pencils. Monthly production varies. The pencils are identical and they have a market price. Market price varies. Agents A, B and C belong to the senior tranche. Agent A is contractually bound to buy half of the production, up to total volume of 1000 pencils for the fixed price of EUR 4. Similarly, agents B and C are contractually bound to buy a quarter, each, of the production up to total volume of 500 pencils, each, for a fixed priced of EUR 5. In addition, Agent A has an option to buy an additional 1000 pencils for a strike price of EUR 5, at her discretion. Agent D belongs to the junior tranche. Agent D has the option to buy 5000 pencils from whatever is left from the senior tranche for a strike price of EUR 3, at her discretion.p  pMy question is, given two vectors, each 24 elements, of production volumes and market prices, how many pencils does Agent D end up buyingp  pAs I see it, the problem is how to link various objects of type Agent and how to get the pencils to flow through this net of Agents, so that each Agent grabs whatever that Agent is obliged tohas the right to and passes the unwanted ones to the next Agentgroup of Agents. The challenge is that there can be multiple Agents at each tranche.p

Negative 53 pI am using the ado.net entity model to connect to a SQL Server 2005 database.  I use LinqtoEntities to copy the data to a list, where I do some other stuff with it.  The entity model was built by importing a view from the database.  Anyway, I wrote the linq query, and it does in fact return all 23 unique rows.

Negative 53 pI am working on a project which is basically a knowledge based question answering system. My system takes query from the user, download the relevant documents from Wikipedia, strips all the html tags and extracts the plain text. After this, it tokenizes the document into sentences, then forms the termdocumentTD matrixThe query is also passed as a sentence. This TD matrix is then forwarded to pLSAProbabilistic Latent Symentic Analysis algorithm. Then, finally calculates the cosine similarity among the documentsentence vectors with query vector. Based on the similarity with the query vector, the most relevant sentence is displayed as the answer. Stemming is also done at the formation of TD Matrix.

Negative 53 pI am trying to parse a build log file to get some information, using regular expressions.

Basic problem is when I cut the number of lines to about 19000, using some conditions, it did not changed anything, actually made it worse. I do not understand, if I remove the regular expressions altogether, only scanning the file takes about 6s. That means regular expressions are the main time consuming process here. So why the does not go at least some amount lower when I removed half of the lines.p  pAlso, can anyone tell me what kind of regular expression is faster, more generic one or more specific one. i.e. I can match this line codetimeDProgram FilesMicrosoft Visual Studio 11.0VCbinc1xx.dll0.047scode uniquley in file using this regex also  code.c1xx.dll.code.

For the application I use OpenLayers and came to an strange issue when ported the code from slippymap to my application. Basically I use the same code, and for local tiles I set up the url of my tile server.p  pThe issue is that when switching to the Local layer I only see the pink layer of the map, but the src attribute of the image tag loads the actual tile. I tried with Firebug to remove the pink layer, but behind it there is no image there Coping the url from src attribute of the img tag opens the tile as an image.p  pTried this to Chrome and the Local layer is working, in IE 7,8,9 too. The problem is only with FF and I suspect something with OpenLayers, but not sure what. The Mapnik layer is working and showing tiles on all browsers.

Negative 53 pI have a webform which has certain fields with values displayed on it. These fields are editable. There is a list of things that needs to be updated which are time consuming following the edits  1. all the edited values has to be entered into database 2. There is a scheuler which picks these values and run cetain modulesp  pSo when edits are made in quick succession, we cant go ahead and perform these updates. Before we enter The values into the database, we ll see if two edits are made for the same field. If so we ll pick only the latest edit and enter into the db.So the edited values has to be periodically picked must be configurable so that we can avoid running the expensive updates twice. p  pI am planning it to design it using a push notification and queue. That is whenever an edit is made it will be pushed into the queue. This queue will be periodically checked to get the updates and finally data is pushed into the database.Is there any other better way of doing this Sorry for the lengthy explanation.p

I need the lines in the shorter file to be scanned through every range pair in the longer file  not just the range in the same row. p  pI have been working with the functions posted in the original question, and I feel like there should be a way to apply it to a more general loop that compares every line in the first file to each line in the second file, but I havent figured it out yet. If anyone has any suggestions, I would appreciate it. p  pemem EDITED.p  pThe nature of the data is this Each range is not necessarily unique, although most are. They are also not of equal size, and some fall completely within others. codefindIntervalcode therefore produces an error, because the ranges cannot be sorted in order to fall in nondecending order.p  pHere are first 6 lines of each data framep  precodefile1test lt data.frameSNPcrs2343, rs211, rs754, rs854, rs343, rs626, BPc860269, 369640, 861822, 367934, 706940, 717244   file2 lt data.frameGenecE613, E92, E49, E3543, E11, E233, BPstartc367640, 621059, 721320, 860260, 861322, 879584, BPend  c368634, 622053, 722513, 879955, 879533, 894689 codepre  pSo, as you can see, the range on the 5th line lies within the range on the 4th line, and two SNPs from the first file fall within the range on the 4th line, but only one falls within the range on the second line.p  pThe first file, which contains the SNPs, has only 400 lines. However the second file, containing the ranges, has about 20K. What I would like to produce as an output is a data frame containing the lines from the first file the SNPs with BPs that fall into the BP range in the second file. If a SNP falls into two ranges, then it would appear twice, etc. p

Negative 53 pIm trying to figure out if I can do two kinds of searches on my data model using the same fetch request, but with different predicates depending on whether the search input is a letter or number. p  pSo I have a Contact entity, and a Phone entity. The contact has a list of phoneNumbers work, cell, etc. So what I want to do is have a fetch request that includes the subentities which I think will bring back the contact and its list of phoneNumbers Then depending on whether the user entered a letter or a digit, search either the contact name or within the phone numbers. Im not sure how to do the latter part in a predicate though, or if its even possible, given its a list of numbers and not just one otherwise I think I could do contact.number. p  pIf its NOT possible, Im not sure what else to try. I display the results using the contact name. So if I have a completely different fetch request for the Phone scenario, I can bring back all the phone numbers  but then I would have to do a second fetch to get all the contacts tied to those phone numbers in order to be able to display the names of the results That seems really slow. I have 40k contacts.......p

Negative 53 pI cant seem for the life of me to get this working. Basically the scenario goes like this. I have a function that gets executed and pops up a jQuiry Dialog window with a datepicker embedded in it. The user selects a date and presto, the date gets chosen and an automated message is captured into a var. The problem is that when the same tpe of code is executed again, the sdate changes but the text remains the same with a new date. Id like to have dynamic text with a dynamic date. This is tricky because I know that the datepicker is a call back function, which is basically beyond my knowledge of javascript coding.p  precodeltdiv styledisplaynone idddgt ltdiv idd1gtltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  peg. test1 test2p  precodevar sdate, text       function testx                   if x  1               dd                 .dialog                 autoOpen true,                 modal true,                 overlay                      opacity 1.0,                     background black                 ,                 title SELECT DATE 1...,                 height 235,                 width 235,                 draggable false,                 resizable false                          d1                 .datepicker                 onSelect function                        sdate  this                         .val                     dd                         .dialogclose                      text  THE DATE YOU HAVE CHOSEN IS   sdate  .                     alerttext                   end of onSelect function               end of datepicker           end of x  1           else if x  2               dd                 .dialog                 autoOpen true,                 modal true,                 overlay                      opacity 1.0,                     background black                 ,                 title SELECT DATE 2...,                 height 235,                 width 235,                 draggable false,                 resizable false                          d1                 .datepicker                 onSelect function                        sdate  this                         .val                     dd                         .dialogclose                      text  THE 2ND DATE YOU HAVE CHOSEN IS   sdate  .                     alerttext                   end of onSelect function               end of datepicker           end of x  2       end of function codepre  pGoing crazy and need the help of the experts on this forum.p  pMuch thanks and appreciation for all your help an supportp

This function returns a string contained inside this array. But since this array of strings codestrcode is a local variable, it should be cleaned from memory after it returns right, so I was expecting to get some sort of a memory access error.p  pShould I consider myself lucky that this code works i.e. is this an undefined behavior or this is actually a good way of doing things in this case, whyp  pMy guess is that the pointer to the array codestrcode gets cleaned after the function returns, but not the actual content that it points to, which stays in memory until something else writes on it. I would really appreciate if somebody could confirm that, or else, tell me what is actually going on.p  pThanks in advancep  pPS The way I would do it is to pass a buffer as a parameter, but Im just curious to know why, surprisingly at least for me, this actually works.p

Negative 53 pIn an embedded application I am working on, I frequently need to packetize data from several different objects to be sent out over a serial port. Similarly, data comes in on the serial port that needs to be written to several different objects.p  pFor compatibility reasons, the ordering of the data in the packets does not allow for all the data associated with one object to be placed consecutively in the packet. So I can not easily vectorize, etc. data from each object and then put all that in a packet.p  pI can achieve proper functionality using a very large number of gettersmutators that the packet class uses to createdecode transmittedreceived packets. But this does not seem very elegant.p  pI could make the packet class a friend of the classes it pullswrites data fromto, but I was always told to avoid using friends as that sort of violates objectoriented principles.p  pIdeally the classes that handle the actual application would not know anything about the packet class and not have to provide gettersmutators exclusively for it and they simply would have new data if a packet came in between updates.p  pI thought that maybe I could pass references or pointers to the relevant member variables to the packet class at startup, but that is also tricky because all the members are not the same size. Perhaps I could also pass the size information as well Would there be a way to vectorize a list of void pointer to member and size of member pairs so that the packet class does not need to take a gigantic amount of arguments to its constructorp  pI am not sure how well I have described this problem, but I can certainly provide clarifications and more information if that would help. Thanks very much for any ideas.p  pAbbreviated example of tx packet class currentlyp  precodeclass PacketTx  private   uint8t buffer[MAXPACKETSIZE]    MAXPACKETSIZE is 200 public   PacketTxobject1 firstObject,            object2 secondObject,            object3 thirdObject             ...etc...                void sendPacketvoid   void PacketTxsendPacketvoid    uint32t i  0    int16t tempVar1  firstObjectgtgetVar1   uint32t tempVar2  secondObjectgtgetVar2   uint8t tempVar3  firstObjectgtgetVar3   int32t tempVar4  thirdObjectgtgetVar4    ...etc...    memcpybuffer  i, amptempVar1, sizeoftempVar1   i  sizeoftempVar1    memcpybuffer  i, amptempVar2, sizeoftempVar2   i  sizeoftempVar2    memcpybuffer  i, amptempVar3, sizeoftempVar3   i  sizeoftempVar3    memcpybuffer  i, amptempVar4, sizeoftempVar4   i  sizeoftempVar4     ...etc...    foruint32t j  0 j lt i j     putcstaticcastltchargtbuffer[i]  codepre  pThis example doesnt include header, checksum, etc., but it should give a basic idea of what is causing me a headache.p

Negative 53 pI recently started learning about node.js, a javascript library on top of V8 known for its nonblocking IO and incredible speed.p  pTo my understanding, node does not wait for IO to respond, but runs an event loop similar to a game loop that keeps checking unfinished operations and continuescompletes them as soon as IO responds. Node performance was compared to Apache HTTPD with node being significantly faster while using less memory.p  pNow if you read about Apache, you learn it uses 1 thread per user, which supposedly slows it down significantly and this is where my question appearsp  pIf you compare threads to what node does internally in its event loop, you start seeing the similarities Both are abstractions of an unfinished process that waits for a resource to respond, both check if the operation made progress regularly and then dont occupy the CPU for a certain amount of time at least I think a good blocking API sleeps for a few milliseconds before rechecking.p  pNow where is that striking, critical difference that makes threads so much worsep

Negative 53 pI know you can define overflowhidden on the body of the HTML to remove the scrollbar, but I would like to still be able to scroll with the arrows or scroll wheel on a mouse.p  pThanks in advance for any help.p  pEdit Thanks for all the advice about on hover scrollbars and custom bars. Also thank you for all concerns about impacting users experience by removing the scrollbars. I shall elaborate a little more so you explain where I am coming from.p  pI have a circular page if you scroll with a scroll wheel or arrow button, when it reaches the bottom it resets to the top of the page and starts again. A never ending loop. A scrollbar impacts on this as a bar is limited and when it reaches the bottom and resets to the top the users mouse is still at the bottom of the page meaning when they move it there is some flickering between the top and bottom of the page.p  pI plan to remove the scroll bar and replace it with arrow buttons at the top and the bottom of the window. This is why I would like to remove the scrollbar completely but leave the scrolling functionality.p

Negative 53 pI have an event driven app that I was tasked with maintaining. About 100 events run every 30 seconds, on separate timers. Over time the events alias into a constant stream of about 13 events per second. Memory usage does not appear dependent on the number of events firing in any given second. Each event polls data from a Webservice, checks the data using a LINQ2SQL DataContext against the previously polled data I do not dispose or null out the DataContext when done, and if the data is different, updates the database and pushes the new data as an XML message to receiver service via TCP.p  pThis app appears to have a memory leak which p  ol lionly manifests after 30m of running either debug or releaseli liwont manifest when profiling [Im using .NET Memory Profiler 4.5]li ol  pCharacteristics  On startup the program uses 30MB. As time progresses this Memory usage in Task Manager will begin pogoing, first only slightly, between 50 and 150MB, and eventually gets worse, oscillating between 200MB and 1GB. When this happens, it happens a few times within a second or two, then settles down at 150MB for the next 1020 or so seconds. p  pIve been trying to catch this behavior in action using memory profiling. So far Ive been unsuccessful, I cant get the app to pogo or oscillate in memory usage anywhere near like I can when the profiler isnt watching. However, Ive been noticing a squarewave sort of pattern on the memory usage as the Garbage Collector stages 1 and 2 run that looks very similar to what I see in Task Manager, except the memory usage oscillations in the squarewave are 10MB wide, instead of 800MB 200MB to 1GB. Now, according to Google Images, Garbage collection in a properly functioning app looks more like a sawtooth wave than square.p  pI frankly dont see any way that my app could be pogoing between 200MB and 1GB of memory usage within a second and NOT be spiking the CPU to 100.p  pI have read about some problems that can manifest between garbage collection  event handling, but I have several paths I could go investigate and am trying to narrow down which one to spend time on. Im still pretty slow at .NET and havent developed the intuition I have for embedded devices running C that generally helps me filter what I should investigate first. What if FEELS like is perhaps some event handlers are losing and regaining references to [massive amounts of data] I dont know how this could even happen seeing as memory usage appears to spike back up to 1GB soon after the garbage collector runs and drops memory usage back to 200MB.p  pPrevious versions of this app did not have these problems. Two changes I have made since then includep  ol liutilizing LINQ2SQL instead of our own data manager which had an ADORecordSetHelper object we utilized to execute hardcoded SQL statementsli lichanging the piece of software we use to send the TCP XML messages to a receiver. Due to the simplicity of the what were doing in 2, it COULD be the source of the problem but this memory usage behavior makes me think otherwise.li ol  pI guess my main questions at this point arep  ul liShould I be calling dispose on my LINQ2SQL DataContexts before I return from the method I create them inli liShould I null them out insteadli liif an exception were occuring somewhere in a method after creation of a DataContext, could it cause the DataContext to be kept in memory indefinitelyli liif I store a result from a LINQ query to a valuetype ie int not var, is it lazyloaded then, or lazyd when the variable is usedli lihow possible is it for eventdriven frameworks to hypothetically lose and regain referencesli ul  pedit the events have instancebased subscriptions like discussed a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions298261doeventhandlersstopgarbagecollectionfromoccuringherea and are never unsubscribed for the life of the app.p  pedit2 finally managed to catch it in the profiler, appears to be a 200MB system.string thats being created somehow. Thanks everyone for ruling out GC behavior.p

The down side is that this strongonly works oncestrong.  After I stop the project and run it again, it once again skips all breakpoints.

Negative 53 pI have this problem. I searched the site and others were having similar problems, but none of the answers seemed to work. Those included setting lineheight to 0px and setting all marginspaddings to 0px. I use Google Chromes Inspect Element material to check the marginspaddings. I hovered over my a element and li element to see if they had any unnecessary paddings or margins, but they didnt. p  pWhat was weird is that they had a little white space, not occupied by any element in the entire document, between each link. p  pRight now, as there are no borders between the text, it is unrecognizable, but the space around the a in Link4 is smaller than the space around the text in Link1. The width of the first li element is strangely 4px wider than the 4th li container, and there is a little white space.

But one datasource on JBoss and other on Glassfish and transaction should span save operation on both datasources simultaneously. This is what I am trying to achieve. I have a web application including spring for servicedata layer currently running on JBoss.p  pAs you said earlier  I will have two persistence.xmls one for JBoss and one for Glassfish. As I am doing this first time I wasam in doubt whether the transactionthat spans two datasources on different serversin this case JBoss and Glassfish, can this be executed entirely by JBossin case if the entire business logic resides in serviceImpl class deployed on JBoss In this case I will be using JBoss transaction manager property nametransactionManagerName valuejavajbossTransactionManager . Is this sufficient or do I need to similarly have Glassfish transaction manager too Sorry if this has created the confusion.p  pAnother question from me was that is there a provision for speifying jndi ports in persistence.xmlanywhere elseDefinitely I will have two different persistence.xmls and I will mention the target server as JBoss in one and as Glassfish in another.p  pDo we have a technique in spring by which business logic can be distributed across different servers like JBossGlassfish and still under one single transatcion I did not know if this can be an option. Were u talking about this scenario in which it will require two different deployment scripts one for each serverp  pThanks Prakashp

Negative 53 pSo Im trying to play an MP3 radio stream generated by Icecast2 using Soundmanager2. When Soundmanager2 uses Flash, the stream instantly starts playing when I open the page with the autoplay Soundmanager2 element in it. However, if I disable Flash or use a platform that doesnt support Flash and use HTML5, the sound only starts playing after 610 seconds. This is very annoying, since potential listeners have short attention and may end up closing the window within those 10 seconds.p  pIs there any way to make Soundmanager2 start playing the stream instantly when using HTML5p

Negative 53 pI have a UICollectionViewController that is part of a Navigation Controller and Tab Bar Controller. At the beginning of the Navigation Controller, I have Interface Builder set to display the Toolbar at the bottom of the View.

This part works perfectly, my problem comes from the UICollectionViewCell that I have in the UICollectionView.

However, when I force a code[self.collectionView reloadData]code after the warning, the correct value is returned for codeself.collectionView.frame.sizecode and the cell loads.p  pIm really frustrated at this and would greatly appreciate any help that anyone can offer.p  pstrongEditstrong After reading Mundis comment, I ended up changing some of my code top  precodevoidviewWillAppearBOOLanimated      [self.navigationController setToolbarHiddenNO animatedYES]     [self.collectionView reloadData]  codepre  pAnd the issue was solved.

Negative 53 pIve made a GUI that runs beautifully in Python, but want to make an exe so I can give it to people who do not have Python.  Ive created exes before using codepy2execode, but never with a GUI.  As with any other first time, I ran into some issues which Ive managed to fix except one when I run the executable, a blank window pops up which looks like a cmd prompt, then disappears after a few seconds.  After closer inspection, I found an error message which pops up right before the window disappears. Its an codeImportErrorcode saying it cannot find a file I created and then imported using codename  importCRPYLogcode where codeCRPYLogcode is the name of the file it cannot find.p  pIve tried placing this file in the same directory as the executable and because of limitations with codeimportcode I cant specify a path of the file.  My problem seems identical to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13253048py2exeimporterrorthis onea, except Im using codeimportcode.  How do I adapt that solution for codeimportcode Thanks in advancep

Negative 53 pI have an application that allow user to define the order of elements by simply defining an index on each element the elements are xml files loaded at the runtime.p  pThe rule is simple, higher is the index, higher is the element in the layer stack just like zindex in CSS. But if there is 2 elements at the same index, I have to add the last element right after the existing one. And, if the new computed index is taken, I have to move the content of the list to make a place to put the new item. And this, recursively.p  pHere is the sample of what the structure look likep  precode  1  lowest item     2  lower item     lt if I add an element at the index 3, there is no problem  4  higher item     9  highest item   codepre  pBut, if the index 3 is already taken, i have to insert the new item just after, at index 4.

For example, the list can contain the indexes code1, 2, 3, 5, 10code as well as code30, 32, 52, 9999code.p  pI have tried so much ways that my brain hurt. I am lost in all these recursive function, which even dont work. If anybody know a working way to perform this reordering, it would be really great.p

Is creating a codeDependencyPropertycode for a collection within a control any different from codeDependencyPropertycode for a simple codestringcode propertyp

Negative 53 pI have long struggled with how best to deal with warnings for implicit type coercions in C.p  pLets start off with a nonexhaustive list of examples. Compilers tend to vary widely in how pedantic they are.p  precodeint mainint argc, char argv[]       Truncation from const int to float      float a  16777217      Potential loss of sign in conversion from int to unsigned int      unsigned int b  1      Conversion from int to char, possible loss of data      int c  1     char d  c      Conversion from int to unsigned char, possible loss of data      uint16t e  1     uint8t f  e gtgt 8      Pointer targets in initialization differ in signedness      unsigned int g  ampargc      Initialization from incompatible pointer type technically an error      const char const h  argv      Different volatile qualifiers      const volatile char i  argv     strleni      Generates a warning in an old embedded C compiler. No offhand reference.      char j  malloc1     return 0  codepre  pIn principle these are beneficial and often reveal real bugs. The problem is that once discovered my strategy for acknowledging them has generally either been through overspecified typecasts, a cure worse than the disease if ever there was one, or by reducing the warning level or selectively disabling particularly common warnings through pragmas. The latter remedy is of course not possible if youre forced to work under draconian coding standards, such as MISRA C.p  pMore advanced static analysis tools generally offer some mechanism for indicating falsepositives which C compilers rarely seem to, and in any event such warning numbers are far from portable.p  pWhat is the recommended bestpractice herep  pI think I want something along the lines of constcast in C, plus unsignedcast, demotioncast, volatilecast and what have you.p  pLastly I apologize if this has already been asked, I imagine it has but was only able to find questions dealing with specific warnings rather the overarching problem.p

Negative 53 pI am working on a Productivity app and need to be able to calculate in C inches and centimeters. Based on pixels, obviously.p  pWhen you open Microsoft Word, and search through the Templates, youll find, for example, business cards. And youll see that their measurements are based upon inches andor centimeters. How do they get those calculations when theyre dealing only with pixels on a screenp  pPeople generally say blah blah you cant do that blah blah blah but thats not true at all. I printed a sample business card, MS Word said it would be about 8x4. On the screen it was not that big but when it was printed onto paper it was exactly what it said. So it can be done and I dont want to hear another person say You cannot do that.p
Negative 53 pMy problem is I have a structure similar to thisp  pre    id 1,   participants [      name joe, status 0 ,      name james, status 2   ],   content mongomongo      id 2,   participants [      name joe, status 1 ,      name jordan, status 3   ],   content dongodongo   pre  pWhat I want to do is run a query with almost the same effect as thisp  precodedb.find id  in someArray,  participants elemMatch name someName  codepre  pI would specify an array of object IDs for the in, and then I would provide an username. What happens is that it would give me back both objects, but the participants array only has the entry that the elemMatch foundp  pre    id 1,   participants [      name joe, status 0    ]      id 2,   participants [      name joe, status 1    ] pre  pThis is what I want, but the part that I DONT want is that it leaves out other fields namely codecontentcode.

Negative 53 pI am creating a custom analog clock with images for hour, second, minute hands. The clock works fine but only problem is the anchoring of the hands. Below is an image of the clock attached. The hour, minute hands are anchored at the center which makes the clock look bad. All the hands should be anchored at the edges so that it looks more realistic and readable. Can someone suggest something.

Negative 53 pafter creating multiple objects extending JavaFXs application object, i wanted to incorporate some of them under one full UI. so i created another object extending application, created instances of each little app, called their start method and used a method i created in each little application to retrieve its root node to the full UI application. i then added these into the full UI scene and all of them were presented in that one GUI. problem is some are static and some actually work as expected. all of the little apps have services which they run and update their ui from time to time using platform.runlater. but only some actually update. ive tried canceling some of them and then those which didnt work suddenly work.  why are those services not running is there a restriction on the amount of threads thanksp

Negative 53 pIm still quite new to AngularJS and I think Im having trouble understanding the timing with scope. In a controller, Ive setup a watcher for some model data that is bound to various form elements. The watcher fires off an ajax request when the data changes, except if the form is not valid. Im checking the form validity with myForm.valid. This is all pretty straight forward, however, except when the model data is updated in the controller, and not the form. The validations runs as expected, but form.valid still has the previous value, not what it should be with the updated data. For example, if the form was previously valid, then I delete the model value bound to a required input, the watcher will fire because the model data has changed, but when I log the value of myForm.valid its value is still true, even though it should be false.p  pSo my question is A. why is this happening, but more importantly B. what is the correct way to handle what I am trying to accomplish Would a custom directive make sensep  pHere is a simplified example.p  pHTMLp  precodeltdiv ngcontrollerMyCtrlgt     ltform namemyFormgt         ltinput typetext namemyField ngmodelmyData requiredgt         ltbutton typebutton ngclickmyDatagtDeleteltbuttongt     ltformgt      ltdivgt         The watcher says the form is ltstronggt formStatus ltstronggt         ltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pControllerp  precodemyApp.controllerMyCtrl, [scope, functionscope      scope.myData  abc     scope.formStatus        scope.watchmyData, functionnewVal, oldVal          if newVal  oldVal              console.logmy data changed             console.logmy form valid  , scope.myForm.valid                     scope.formStatus  scope.myForm.valid  Valid  Invalid               ] codepre  pFiddle a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netanpsince83cK6cc1 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netanpsince83cK6cc1ap

Negative 53 pstrongTLDRstrong emCan someone point me to a through implementation of a caching system that is added to the solution through interceptionemp  pIm refactoring one of my solutions so that crosscutting concerns are implemented through Unity Intercept. Ive read the guides from MSFT, and now I think I can very easily implement the interception behaviors.p  pstrongHoweverstrong, I was wondering about caching I want to consistently use the cache regions and keys throughout the solution. Furthermore, I have keyspecif configurations for expiration on my caching system. p  pOn one example in the Unitys Developer Guide, it checks the method name  this is a bad approach since it would mean altering the implementation everytime a new classmethod must use cache obviously. p  pIm having this mad idea of implementing a configurable Interceptor that learns how to compose the region and key from the given parameters, and is configurable for each classtypemethod. However this would push a lot of responsibility to configuration I dont like the feeling that Im programming in the .config file. p  pAs you can see, Im a tad bit lost on how to go about this. I dont like singletons and right now the caching system is a singleton, accessed everywhere by the solution. Can someone link me to a good documentation on how I should proceed about this Is it possible to add cache and have proper keysregions defined on the cachep

Negative 53 pI wrote a program the involved two rows of integers that would periodically swap places. So, what I did was allocate two separate pointers to integers that would model the needed rows. I then placed both of the pointers into a constant pointer array that would easily facilitate the swapping. p  pThe problem I am having was by complete mistake. Take this for examplep  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt include ltstdlib.hgt  int mainvoid      char a  mallocsizeofchar5     char temp[]  a     int i, h, k  a      fori  0 i lt 5 i         a[i]  k      fori  0 i lt 5 i         printfc , temp[0][i]      freea     return 0  codepre  pWith output codea b c d ecode a hrefhttpideone.comvmC34k relnofollowIdeOneap  pI accidentally attempted to access the members of the array contained within the static array by secondorder dereferencing [][]p  pI did not think much of this event because everything compiled and ran perfectly, even giving the expected results at the output. The problem came when I ran a memory analysis and found that I was getting tons of addressing errors and alleged memory leaks. p  pSo, to start the debugging process I wanted to come here and ask why this worked and if its valid C syntax. I was under the impression thatp  precodetemp[0] codepre  pWould dereference to codecharcode, codeacode. It would then take a further dereference of codeacode to access its members. Further, I was under the impression thatp  precodetemp[row][col] codepre  pIs translated top  precodetemp  rowcol  col codepre  pat run time. As such, the double dereference of codetemp[0][i]code should give an offset from codetempcode and not access codeacode at all.p  hr  pWhats more interesting is that thisp  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt include ltstdlib.hgt  int mainvoid      char a  mallocsizeofchar5     char b  mallocsizeofchar5     char temp[]  a, b     int i, h, k  a, j  A       fori  0 i lt 5 i         a[i]  k         b[i]  j           fori  0 i lt 5 i         forh  0 h lt 5 h             printfc , temp[i][h]         puts            freea     freeb     return 0      codepre  pDoes not compile when run at a hrefhttpideone.comvmC34k relnofollow titleIdeOneIdeOnea.

The query is entirely independent of the flat file data so Im not sure a join is appropriate here. Rather than use a triggerbased solution Id like to solve this in ssis if practical.p  pThe query returns one value which would be used for every row from the flat file. It would be good if the query were not evaluated once per row obviously.p

Negative 53 pI have a situation where I have a large collection of items stored in codeHttpApplicationStatecode which internally uses a codeNameValueCollectioncode to store keyvalue pairs.

Negative 53 pI am making a simple 2048 clone in java, just for fun, but Im having a problem. After the board fills up, MouseListener seems to stop listening. For now, that isnt a problem, but part of the 2048 game is that you can move if you have tiles you can combine even when all tiles are full, so it will become a problem later in development. p  pExpected output A 2 is shown on the screen. Every time you click, one more 2 will show up, until the board is full. When you click the top of the screen, the top left tile will become 1, and when you click the bottom, it becomes 2, left is 3, and right is 4. Once the board fills up, I expect it to continue listening and keep changing that top left tile to the corresponding numbers. p  pReal output All of the above, except that once all the tiles are full, the top left corner will not change values. p  pHow do I make it so that the MouseListener does not stop listeningp  pThe following is my code.p  precodepackage a2048  import java.awt.event. import

Negative 53 pMongoTemplate inserts an attribute named class into anything it puts into Mongo, and there are ways to turn that off.p  pHowever, it seems to be unwilling to read anything back out of it that doesnt have a class attribute.  Simply removing that from the mongo document appears to make it inaccessible.  Since reading data you didnt write yourself is an obvious use case, I figure I must be missing something here.p  pIve been attempting to use thisp  precodeListltSomeClassgt list  mongoTemplate.findAllSomeClass.class, someCollection codepre  p...where SomeClass is annotated with Id and Document, and the documents in someCollection  otherwise correctly map to the object.  I can verify this by creating one of these objects in code, using insert to get it into Mongo, and then see that I can read it back out again.p  pThis works just fine if class is there but fails if it is not.  I do not care about polymorphism or anything that might actually need this attribute.  How can I get MongoTemplate to read data that it didnt itself writep

If I set layoutweight1 on the ImageView and layoutwidth0dip the image is compressed as well.p  hr  pOnik posed a suitable solution to the problem, but it pointed out that really my question is an oversimplification.  I am actually not using 2 views in my real layout.  The TextView is a LinearLayout that is sizing itself to fit its content properly, but it is pushing the ImageView to the right again, properly and then causing it to shrink again, what I am trying to get rid of.p

Any way to fix this behaviour Why is this happeningp  pI have the following viewportp  precodeltViewport3Dgt     lt Camera gt     ltViewport3D.Cameragt         ltPerspectiveCamera Position0,0,100 LookDirection0,0,1 UpDirection0,1,0 gt     ltViewport3D.Cameragt      lt Light gt     ltModelVisual3Dgt         ltModelVisual3D.Contentgt             ltAmbientLight ColorWhite gt         ltModelVisual3D.Contentgt     ltModelVisual3Dgt      lt this doesnt work gt     ltmediaElementTestVideoControl gt      lt but this does gt     ltltModelVisual3Dgt         ltModelVisual3D.Contentgt             ltGeometryModel3Dgt                  ltGeometryModel3D.Geometrygt                     ltMeshGeometry3D                          Positions100,100,0 100,100,0 100,100,0 100,100,0                         TextureCoordinates0,1 1,1 1,0 0,0                         TriangleIndices0 1 2   0 2 3                         gt                 ltGeometryModel3D.Geometrygt                  ltGeometryModel3D.Materialgt                     ltDiffuseMaterialgt                         ltDiffuseMaterial.Brushgt                             ltVisualBrushgt                                 ltVisualBrush.Visualgt                                     ltMediaElement Sourcehttpwww.quirksmode.orghtml5videosbigbuckbunny.mp4 gt                                 ltVisualBrush.Visualgt                             ltVisualBrushgt                         ltDiffuseMaterial.Brushgt                     ltDiffuseMaterialgt                 ltGeometryModel3D.Materialgt             ltGeometryModel3Dgt         ltModelVisual3D.Contentgt     ltModelVisual3Dgtgt ltViewport3Dgt codepre  pVideoControl.xamlp  precodeltUIElement3D xClassMediaElementTest.VideoControl          xmlnshttpschemas.microsoft.comwinfx2006xamlpresentation          xmlnsxhttpschemas.microsoft.comwinfx2006xamlgt codepre  pVideoControl.xaml.csp  precodepublic partial class VideoControl      public VideoControl              InitializeComponent         Visual3DModel  CreateModel           private GeometryModel3D CreateModel              return new GeometryModel3D                      Geometry  new MeshGeometry3D                              Positions  new Point3DCollection                                      new Point3D100, 100, 0,                     new Point3D100, 100, 0,                     new Point3D100, 100, 0,                     new Point3D100, 100, 0                 ,                  TextureCoordinates  new PointCollection                                      new Point0, 1,                     new Point1, 1,                     new Point1, 0,                     new Point0, 0                 ,                  TriangleIndices  new Int32Collection                                      0, 1, 2,                     0, 2, 3                              ,             Material  new DiffuseMaterialnew VisualBrushnew MediaElement                              Source  new Urihttpwww.quirksmode.orghtml5videosbigbuckbunny.mp4, UriKind.RelativeOrAbsolute                             codepre

Negative 53 pNow that the Cutoff date plugin for Sonar is deprecated Ive tried it, and it doesnt seem to work at all, strongis there any way to exclude issues based on a set datestrong p  pFor a large project, it is desirable to really start at fresh at given point.  Maintaining a low alert threshold  lt 100 alerts  is much more manageable for the developers than cluttering the issues listings with old historylow priority issues. 1500. Identifying the new and relevant ones are then much harder.p  pWhat we want to focus on are new issues.  Example  when you have changed the quality rules for say 200.000 lines of code, you really only are interested in what is produced from now on and changes to already existing code that breaks the new rules. p

Negative 53 pI made some slight adjustments to my code to fix some security issues.  The changes were very small.  I also changed one link in my jsp to get rid of an old outdated website, and show the new link.  p  pProblem is, none of my security code fixes show up in the environment. I have triple checked that the code is pushed all the way in my repository.   When I export the EAR from the WAS console, and look at the code, via 7 ZIP and notepad, all my changes are there.  However, when that very same EAR is running on the server, it magically retains the outdated flawed code.  To make this even more perplexing, my .jsp link change shows up no problem, exactly the way I intended it.  I cannot, for the life of me, figure out what is going on here.  p  pMy gut instinct think that WAS has some kind of .class cache that isnt being cleared when the new code is deployed.  p  pHas anyone else dealt with something like thisp

Negative 53 pI have a Windows 8 system with two Ethernet adapters specifically for testing network stuff. I am writing an application that will send a codeAre you therecode UDP broadcast across the entire local network on port 4950 and then wait for any responses from FPGA boards that say codeYes Im here.code on port 4951.p  pThe problem is that in Windows 8 and probably in older versions too, sending a broadcast to code255.255.255.255code actually only picks the primary network adapter, but my application must send a broadcast to every single network adapter on my computer. I hardcoded a broadcast to my second nonprimary NIC at the IP address code169.254.66.143code with a netmask of code255.255.0.0code, so the application broadcasts to code169.254.255.255code in order to determine if any boards are on the network of the second NIC.p  pThe board itself has a static IP address of code169.254.1.1code, so when my application broadcasts over the secondary NIC, the broadcast message codeAre you therecode is received by the FPGA board and I can confirm this because the board will tell me over a serial port that it received an Ethernet broadcast. The strange thing is that although the board does send a response back on the correct port of 4951, my application never receives the response, whereas Wireshark emdoesem see the response packet when listening to the secondary NIC.p  pAlso, when I run codenetstat scode before and after a failed attempt to contact any board, I see that the codeReceive Errorscode counter under codeUDP Statistics for IPv4code increments it seems like Windows 8 drops the packet because theres an error, while Wireshark accepts the packet and doesnt say that theres anything wrong with it.p  pstrongtldr What could cause Windows 8 to drop a UDP packet even when Wireshark doesnt show anything wrong with said packetstrongp  pOh, and in case someone says your UDP code doesnt work the application correctly hears responses from boards on my primary NIC it is only when I move a board to the router thats connected to my secondary NIC that my application never receives a response.p  pI have also disabled the Windows Firewall to test whether that is the issue it is not.p

Negative 53 pI am implementing a Python plugin that is part of a larger C program. The goal of this program is to allow the user to input a commands actions in Python. It currently receives a string from the C function and runs it via the exec function. The user can then use an API to affect changes on the larger C program.p  pThe current feature I am working on is a pause execution feature. It needs to remember where it is in the code execution as well as the state of any local variables, and resume execution once a condition has been met. I am not very familiar with Python, and I would like some advice how to implement this feature. My first design ideasp  p1 Using the yield command. This seemed to be a good idea at the start since when you use the next command it remembers everything I needed it to, but the problem is that yield only returns to the previous level in the call stack as far as I can tell. So if the user calls a function that yields it will simply return to the users code, and not the larger C program. As far as I can tell there isnt a way to propagate the yield command up the stackp  p2 Threading Create a main python thread that creates a thread for each command. This main thread would spawn a thread for each command executed and kill it when it is done. If it needs to be suspended and restarted it could do so through a queue of locks.p  pThose were the only two options I came up with. I am not sure the yield function would work or is what it was designed to do. I think the Threading approach would work but might be overkill, and take a long time to develop. I also was looking for some sort of Task Module in Python, but couldnt find exactly what I was looking for. I was wondering if anyone has any other suggestions as I am not very familiar with Python.p  pEDIT As mentioned in the comments I did not explain what needs to happen when the script Pauses. The python plugin needs to allow the C program to continue execution. In my mind this means A returning if we are talking about a single threaded approach, or B Sending a messageFunction call to Cp  pEDIT EDIT As stated I didnt fully explain the problem description. I will make another post that has a better statement of what currently exists, and what needs to happen as well as providing some sudo code. I am new to Stack Overflow, so if this is not the appropriate response please let me know.p

Negative 53 pI have run into a few weird blips testing a throughput program. It seems to work fine and is sending messages over a 1Gbps cable. The program works between two computers one side being the master and the other being the slave. The master sends a message to the slave of size 1,10,100,1000 words chosen by the user which is then echoed back. This process is repeated for usually about 10,000 messages. The transmission can happen over TCP or UDP again chosen by the user.p  pWhat is strange is when multiple instances are run between the same computers, but going to different ports, the total test time actually shrinks, and I can not seem to understand why. I thought that maybe TCP was doing some sort of optimization for larger packets butp  pa they are going to and from different ports b the same thing happens with UDPp  pSo why would multiple instances actually lower the total transmission time for each individual testp

Negative 53 pI am working on an app which uses codeactive directorycode to retrieve users. Sometimes I need to work on the app but AD is not available. I use a wrapper class to retrieve the AD user. I would like to inject a different class based on the configuration. I was thinking on using an appSetting that would tell me the current configutarion and decide what type to use when injecting. Is it possible to get the current configuration without using a Web.config transform Is it possible to inject objects using Unity based on Web.config transformations Can you recommend a better approachp  p[UPDATE]p  pI have a user repository class that loads the users from AD. All I need is to be able to change the implementation of this repository class so that when AD is unavailable I can load the users a different way.

Negative 53 pI recently tried t find out the benefits of using codevoid code arrays instead of typical types codeintcode, codecharcode etc. So I tried to write a polymorphic codevoid code function which takes as arguments 3 arrays codea, b, ccode of any type of data and does a calculation between every node of array codeacode and codebcode and places the results into array codeccode. The type of the calculation sum, sub etc. and the type of data to be calculated is up to the user maybe we can use two more arguments to the function. p  pSo I have the prototype of my function which looks like thisp  precodevoid applyvoid a, void b, void c, int calc, int typeOfCalc codepre  pI cannot understand how to use the contents of every codevoidcode array, depending on its type, and how to do the calculation depending on the type of data the user wants.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pI found an exercise which asks the same thing as I do and saysp  blockquote   pWrite a polymorphic function codeapplycode that takes as parameters same   size tables a, b, c of elements of any every type, makes a   transaction between a [i] b [i] for each i and places the result of   act to c [i].

Negative 53 pI am building an iOS application where I have multiple view controllers made from .xib files.  The entire application will allow both portrait and landscape orientations, but the first three view controllers will be portrait ONLY.  The screen after that will be in landscape ONLY.  For this reason, I have created two subclasses of UINavigationController, one to restrict the first three in portrait mode, and the last one in landscape mode.  p  pAt the moment, I am able to display the first view controller, and lock it in portrait mode.  Here is my codep  precode BOOLapplicationUIApplication application didFinishLaunchingWithOptionsNSDictionary launchOptions       Override point for customization after application launch.

Normally, I would use the reference self.navigationController to push the next view controller on to the stack, but in this case, because Im using a custom navigation controller, it looks like I will have to create a new reference to the custom navigation controller in EACH view controller that Im using.  If this is the case, then that means Im creating a new rootViewController each time, which means essentially, Ill have three different stacks of one view controller each, instead of one stack of three view controllers.  How can I use the same reference to the custom UINavigationController to call pushpop each of the view controllers  Then finally, how would I then connect these view controllers to another one which is using a different navigation controller, yet keep everything on the same stack  I hope this question makes sense.p  pThanks in advance to all who reply.p

Negative 53 pI have multiple stored procedures calling multiple stored procedures in my database. To give a small example, Ive constructed a fictionalised version of a few of them below. In my example, a Java program calls codecalculatebillcode, which calls codecalculatecommissioncode, which calls codeupdaterecordcode.p  pIm hoping to get some advice on how best to propagate the error messages up the stack to the calling Java layer, so the user gets a precise error message corresponding to wherever the error has occurred.p  pIm really quite stuck on this.

Negative 53 pI have an old project, I converted to Visual Studio 2010.  Of course, it remained targeting the .NET Framework 2.0.  So, when I edit the target framework in the Compile tab, and change it to 3.5, it closes and reopens the project.  However, the References still show that System, System.Data, etc. are still .NET 2.0.  Further, I cannot access the .ToList method for an array that I need, so it must not be loading the newer framework.  Does anyone have ideas on how it can workp

Negative 53 pSo, I have a 2d hex grid, where each hex is either a wall or a path, and Id like to implement lineofsight in the sense of a hex is visible from another hex if you can draw a straight line from any part of the start hex to any part of the end hex without touching any wall hexes where the edges and vertices of a hex are considered touching that hex.p  pRaycasting from a single point in the starting hex is slow and inaccurate. I thought about raycasting from every vertex of the starting hex, but that is even slower, and there are cases where it still doesnt work mainly on larger gridsp  pThere ought to be an algorithm for doing this that is better. I mean, its essentially just a floodfill with restrictions. Any suggestionsp

Negative 53 pIt seems like this has been asked a lot of times and Ive read so many questions and their answers but none of them would fit to my problemp  pMy situationp  ul liIn my Activity, below a bunch of other stuff, you should see a chessboard. For smallshort smartphones its possible that the remaining space for the chessboard which is a square is not too much. Therefore I cannot simply say that the size of the chessboard is determined by the remaining width. If the remaining height is lower then the height determines the size.li liThe number of squares varies within the game. The chessboard will always be a square but its dimension varies from 3x3 to 8x8.li liI want my chessboard, which is implemented by using a GridView, to have a black border circa 2pd.li liIt would be nice if the squares of the chessboard could be real squares. But I want the size of the chessboard to be fix even if the number of columns varies. Therefore I cannot have a constant border thickness and squares that are real squares since the size of the chessboard minus the border thickness is not guaranteed to be divisible by the number of columns.li ul  pI see two possible solutions to handle this but I cant get them workingp  ol lipTo have a nice square chessboard, I use the follwing xmlp  pcodeltGridView     androidididchessboardgridview     androidlayoutwidthmatchparent     androidlayoutheightmatchparent     androidpadding2dp     androidlayoutmargin10dp     androidbackgroundcolorblack     androidlayoutgravitycenter     androidgravitycenter gt ltGridViewgtcodep  pand in codeonCreatecode the following code in my activityp  precodegridView.setNumColumnsboard.getColumns gridView.getViewTreeObserver.addOnGlobalLayoutListenernew OnGlobalLayoutListener      Override     public void onGlobalLayout           int size  Math.mingridView.getWidth, gridView.getHeight          ViewGroup.LayoutParams params  gridView.getLayoutParams         params.width  size         params.height  size         gridView.setLayoutParamsparams          gridView.getViewTreeObserver.removeOnGlobalLayoutListenerthis      codepre  pAnd in order to have perfect squares as squares I found the following solution for ImageViews which are used by my custom Adapterp  precodepublic class SquareView extends ImageView      public SquareViewContext context         supercontext           Override     public void onMeasureint widthMeasureSpec, int heightMeasureSpec          super.onMeasurewidthMeasureSpec, widthMeasureSpec       codepre  pBut if I have a look at the result I can see that the border line thickness varies because the chessboard with is not divisible by the number of columnsp  pimg srchttps3.postimg.org5g0y0185vborderThicknessVaries.png altborder line varies in thicknessp  pIm OK with that IF I somehow manage to have all squares centered in the GridView. Then the border is thicker than 2dp and its possible that one side is one pixel thicker than the other, but I dont care.p  pQUESTION How can I center the squares such that the border thickness does not vary to that extendpli lipAnother approach would be to have a nice border of exactly 2 dp but the squares wouldnt really be squares. The remaining space that makes the border thicker on the right and at the bottom could be more or less equally distributed over the squares. For example if there are 3 remaining pixels, make the 2., 4. and 6. column each one pixel wider and the 2., 4. and 6. row higher.p  pQUESTION How can I use all the GridView space perfectly for my squares even if that means that my squares arent real squares anymore but some are slightly wider or higherp  pI had thought that the GridView does stretch them automatically but if I use a simple ImageView and not my SquareView for the squares I have a black chessboard if I do not set the size of each square on my own. If I do set a square size for the squares manually I get different wrong results for all the stretchModes.pli ol

Negative 53 pWe are using a set of web parts weve built ourselves to aid in projects we do as consultants. As the web parts progress we build a new version with a different version number of some of the assemblies. There are dependencies between some of these assemblies. To prevent upgrading our entire set of assemblies at once, lately weve adopted bindingRedirects as a way to upgrade some of our assemblies and make bugfixes in them.p  pFor example We are running version 1.0 AssemblyB is depending on AssemblyA. AssemblyA gets upgraded to version 1.1. In order to get this to work in an ASP.NET website, we add a binding redirect voor AssemblyA specifying that anyone looking for version 1.0 should be redirected to version 1.1. At runtime all is well.p  pHowever this construct breaks IntelliSense in ASP.NET markup. How can I fix thisp

Negative 53 pIm working on a form that has a main model being passed to the view.  The model has submodels within it, with partial views to render that content.

I ended up having to base64encode the file first. I had tried that before, but have been waived off of that by a suggestion on the eBay forums. I just changed one of the last headers to codeContentTransferEncoding base64code  and I got a success response.p  pstrongEDIT3, THE REAL SOLUTIONstrong Base 64 encoding only solved my problems with the example XML file. I found that my own XML payload was NOT sending successfully same error as before, but that the script on Github could send that same file just fine. The difference was that the Github script is Python2 and able to mix string and binary data without differentiation. To send binary data in Python3 I just had to make a few simple changes to change all the strings in the requestpart and binarypart into bytes, so that the bytes from the gzip payload would concatenate with it. Looks like thisp  precodebinarypart  brn binarypart  bMIMEboundaryrn binarypart  bContentType applicationoctetstreamrn binarypart  bContentTransferEncoding binaryrn binarypart  bContentID lt  URNUUIDATTACHMENT.encodeutf8  bgtrnrn binarypart  gzipdata  brn binarypart  bMIMEboundary codepre  pSo, no base64 encoding, just needed to figure out how to make Python send real binary data. And the original github repo strongdoesstrong work as advertised, in python2. p

Ill try to recap my thoughts based on the comments with Martin R and Ken Thomases.p  pA block, by default, is created on stack if a codecopycode message is not sent to it ARC does this for us in order to move it on the heap. So, the situation in this case is the following. I create an codeautoreleasecode array and I add two blocks where coderetaincode is called in a implicit manner. When the codeapplicationDidFinishLaunchingcode method finishes is execution, the blocks, since created on the stack they are codeautomaticcode variables disappear. In a later moment, the array called codeblockscode will be released since has been marked as codeautoreleasecode. So, it will crash since it will send a codereleasecode object to blocks that do not exist anymore.p  pstrongSo, my question is the following What does it mean to send a coderetaincode message to a block that is on the stack Why the array is the source of the crash see the back tracestrong In other words, since a block is on the stack, will it bump the retain count of it And when it goes out of scope In addiction, why if I comment the code[weakSelf doSomething1]code line the code works without problems Not very clear to me this part.p

Negative 53 pI have a WCF project that has the potential to be highly automatable. By that I mean, if I identify the EntityName then all I need to do next is replace that value in a number of different places and the service is ready to go.p  pFor example, I have a Bratworst entity. The first thing I do then is create a Bratworst interface using this boilerplatep  precodeusing Blah.Blah.Blah  namespace Super.Tasty.Service      [ServiceContract]     public interface IEntityNameService  IBaseServiceltEntityNameDTOgt    codepre  pNext, the .svc file would need to be changed accordinglyp  precodelt ServiceHost LanguageC Debugtrue ServiceSuper.Tasty.Service.EntityNameService CodeBehindEntityNameService.svc.cs gt codepre  pThen, I need to update the corresponding codebehind file like thisp  precodeusing Blah.Blah.Blah  namespace Super.Tasty.Service      public class EntityNameService  BaseServiceltEntityNameDTOgt, IEntityNameService    codepre  pAnd, finally, I would need to update the web.config file in two different places. The first modification would be again to change the contract property in the endpoint of the services node to point to the IEntityNameService. And then do something similar to a node called serviceBases.p  pSo. Is there a way to automate this Is it possible, for example, to modify Visual Studio so that I just rightclick on the project, select Add SuperTastyService, enter the appropriate EntityName in a dialog and then let VS do the restp  pI believe I can do all this from a T4 template, but Im not sure if I can tell VS to add this as a context menu option. So, can that be done Or, are there other options that might allow me to do this. For example, can a T4 be modified to pop up a dialog box that will allow the user to enter the necessary information to complete this processp  pLooking for any and all suggestions here.p

Negative 53 pI am working on an project which runs a Rails backend and a Angularjs web app on the front end. Both the apps are in a main project folder as subdirectories to keep the two in check and I have been using the git subtree push to deploy the Rails app to Heroku from the root folder. p  pI am now looking to use CircleCI and am having difficulties using this project structure and getting CircleCI to run the correct tests and only deploy the Rails app to Heroku. p  pI tried the follow in the circle.yml p  precodegeneral   builddir server deployment   staging     branch staging     commands        git subtree push prefix server githeroku.comappnamestaging.git master codepre  pThis configuration allows me to run the tests that are in the Rails app but will not deploy, coming back with the error You need to run this command from the toplevel of the working tree.p  precodegeneral   builddir server deployment   staging     branch staging     commands        git push githeroku.comappnamestaging.git master codepre  pThis gave me the error Push rejected, no Cedarsupported app detected as Heroku was not detecting the buildpack for the Rails.p  pI have also tried putting a simple shell script test in the root folder and removing the the builddir from the circle.yml and it will pass the test and do the subtree push of the Rails app to Heroku, but does not run the tests in the Rails app.p  pI have two options, one runs the tests of the Rails app but wont deploy only the Rails app to Heroku and the second run tests in the root but not on the actual Rails app but will deploy correctly.

Negative 53 pthis is my first time so please bear with me. Suppose I have two PCs A and B directly connected to each other via a LAN cable. PC As IP address is 192.168.1.124. PC Bs IP address is 192.168.1.530. Now two PCs wont be able to reach each other because of different subnets or their subnet masks are not proper for direct connectivity between the two. But the question is that subnet mask information is not sent in IP header so how does PCs come to know if packet coming from another 192.168.1.X address is on different subnet.       Reading on different websites, I came to know that devices eg. PC maintain its own routing table and make decisions based on it. But still it is not that clear. Please let me know.

Negative 53 pI have a bitnami Tomcat 7 installation apache  tomcat  mysql on my Mac, with uses java 1.7 76. My Mac uses the java 1.8 runtime. When I deploy my project made in intellij on the same Mac to tomcat and try to run it I get a UnsupportedClassVersionError. It does not matter which version of the JDK I use to compile the project Ive tried the apple 1.6, oracle 1.7 and oracle 1.8 versions and it also does not seem te matter what language level I set. The only way the get the app running is using language level 1.3 using JDK 1.7 of 1.8p  pTo fix the problem I have now set tomcat to run on the 1.8 JDK installed on my Mac, I then configured intellij to use the same JDK. Now everything works fine.p  pMy question Do I always need to compile using the exact same version of the JDK as the java version that runs tomcat Or am I doing something wrong.p  pThe complete error sometimes also shows UnsupportedClassVersionError minor versionp  precodeHTTP Status 500  javax.servlet.ServletException java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError testTestClass  type Exception report  message javax.servlet.ServletException java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError testTestClass  description The server encountered an internal error that prevented it from fulfilling this request.  exception  org.apache.jasper.JasperException javax.servlet.ServletException java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError testTestClass     org.apache.jasper.servlet.JspServletWrapper.handleJspExceptionJspServletWrapper.java549     org.apache.jasper.servlet.JspServletWrapper.serviceJspServletWrapper.java455     org.apache.jasper.servlet.JspServlet.serviceJspFileJspServlet.java395     org.apache.jasper.servlet.JspServlet.serviceJspServlet.java339     javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet.serviceHttpServlet.java731     org.apache.tomcat.websocket.server.WsFilter.doFilterWsFilter.java52 root cause  javax.servlet.ServletException java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError testTestClass     org.apache.jasper.runtime.PageContextImpl.doHandlePageExceptionPageContextImpl.java916     org.apache.jasper.runtime.PageContextImpl.handlePageExceptionPageContextImpl.java845     org.apache.jsp.indexjsp.jspServiceindexjsp.java94     org.apache.jasper.runtime.HttpJspBase.serviceHttpJspBase.java70     javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet.serviceHttpServlet.java731     org.apache.jasper.servlet.JspServletWrapper.serviceJspServletWrapper.java432     org.apache.jasper.servlet.JspServlet.serviceJspFileJspServlet.java395     org.apache.jasper.servlet.JspServlet.serviceJspServlet.java339     javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet.serviceHttpServlet.java731     org.apache.tomcat.websocket.server.WsFilter.doFilterWsFilter.java52 root cause  java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError testTestClass     org.apache.jsp.indexjsp.jspServiceindexjsp.java74     org.apache.jasper.runtime.HttpJspBase.serviceHttpJspBase.java70     javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet.serviceHttpServlet.java731     org.apache.jasper.servlet.JspServletWrapper.serviceJspServletWrapper.java432     org.apache.jasper.servlet.JspServlet.serviceJspFileJspServlet.java395     org.apache.jasper.servlet.JspServlet.serviceJspServlet.java339     javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet.serviceHttpServlet.java731     org.apache.tomcat.websocket.server.WsFilter.doFilterWsFilter.java52 note The full stack trace of the root cause is available in the Apache Tomcat7.0.61 logs. codepre

Negative 53 pWe want to use HTTPS for our microservices communication based on Feign and Ribbon. The services are based on spring boot and tomcat is correctly setup.

Negative 53 pA brief intro to the problem. Ive got a Sass map and Im wanting to reference the keys amp values in that map from emwithin the map itselfem. Im not sure if this is possible, but heres my code, if anyone has any thoughts Id love to hear them.p  hr  pSo Im currently working on tidying up all our colour variables at work, wanting to bring them all into a standard Sass map. The map looks something like thisp  precodemycolors      red  standard c0ffee, dark 0ff1ce ,   green  standard c0ffee, dark mycolorgreen, standard, 10 ,    blue  standard c0ffee, dark 0ff1ce ,  codepre  pIts working as expected, except for the codemycolorcode function call in there. So the codemycolorcode function works as expected, I can parse a colour, an optional variant standarddark amp do an optional adjustment to this colour. My function looks something like thisp  precodefunction mycolor color, variant standard, adjust null      color mapgetmycolors, color    color mapgetcolor, variant    if adjust  color scalecolorcolor, lightness adjust    return color  codepre  pThis can then be called with something like codemycolorgreencode or codemycolorgreen, standard, 10code.p  pHowever as the above codemycolorscode map shows, Im trying to selfreference the map to create variants of colours and keep my code DRY. So for some colours, like coderedcode or codebluecode, I have two specific hex colours from our brand guidelines. But for codegreencode, we just have the standard green. So to make a variant I want to find our standard green, and make it a bit darker. p  pThe simplest fix is to just hard code the hex colours twice, and use Sass codescalecolorcode function. But this would mean our code is no longer DRY. Ultimately if there is no fix this isnt the biggest problem as we shouldnt be changing these variables often, but if possible it would be nice to keep it DRY so I know this will always work and doesnt need to be changed twice.p  pIf anyone has any thoughts on how this could be done better Id love to hear them.p

Negative 53 pI am very new to Tapestry. Ive been trying to create an  Editable TreeGrid essentially a grid that gives me a functionality to collapse and expand rows based on a hierarchical structure.

Negative 53 pI have a class codeBaseLoginDialogcode under a dependency which needs to be modified as it is not extendable out of the box. For this reason, I have created another file codeBaseLoginDialogcode under my projects module with the same package path as the original codeBaseLoginDialogcode. After adding some new methods in my own local codeBaseLoginDialogcode, I cannot use them anywhere in my project without IDEA complaining about the method not being declared. However, the project still compiles and the methods work fine on runtime. If I click the import to browse to the file, IntelliJ still links to the old file but it seems to correctly compile with the new one.p  pHow can I go about fixing this issue Always having error lines and red markers everywhere makes it confusing when coding.p  pSome background The project uses Gradle for the dependencies and compilation. Compiling and running works both with Gradle and with the IntelliJ run operation, it is only the errors being incorrectly displayed that is an issue.p  pThe Grade file adds the required libraries as dependencies. Even though Gradle has both the source and class files, opening a file imported through Gradle still links to the class files. To get around this I also added the required files as sources under Libraries.p  pAny help would be appreciated, thanksp  pEDIT Switched to use a Maven repo on the project, now I dont need to additionally add libraries anymore but this problem still persists.p

Negative 53 pI am going to design a spy app as a project for school to show how mobile technology is involved in our private life. But to make it fulfill its evil intentions, I need this app to grant root access on boot without asking the user for it or leaving logs at SuperSUp  pIs this possible If so, howp  pEdit I actually asked the question kind of wrong. I want to know if this app ,after granted root access once, can create a code or a method to grant itself root access next time it needs it without permission from user.p  pEdit 2 After seeing comments that are suspicious of my intention, the logic behind my project is that there are a lot of times other people have phisical access to our phones. Like when we leave it to a service for fixing, or when we buy a used phone for instance, most people dont know how to perform a full wipe, they dont know if their phone is rooted, they dont know about the risk. And most people believe Mobile Antivirus Apps are not useful and harmful as they create a false feeling of being safe. The purpose of my paper is simply making people be aware of the threat and to graduate from school of course.p

Negative 53 pDoes anyone know  I am finding that Resharper 9.2 is very buggy with testing and burping.  But the funny thing is that I use Resharper the most for a little function of CTRL  T.  It brings up a quick find where you type and it in real time searches methods, classes, test classes, etc for what you are typing.  So if I am working on an enterprise solution with 50 plus projects and each project can have dozens of classes it is easier to use this.p  pI was wondering now that Visual Studio 2015 has in essence done some of what Resharper did with mapping diagraming and removing and adding references if it could do this.  I know you can find by name above the solution explorer or hit CTRL  SHIFT  F to find in the files.  But these are kind of slow so I was wondering if there was a better way to do it.p  pI was using this reference a hrefhttpvisualstudioshortcuts.com2015 relnofollowhttpvisualstudioshortcuts.com2015a and tried some things but did not find what I thought I was looking for by searching for Find, Retrieve, Get in the shortcuts.

Negative 53 pMy question is simple, how do I draw a cylinder in modern OpenGL Im using GLFW together with OpenGL 3.x. My thought at first was to create a function that computes the vertex positions at the bottom and at the top as circles and then draw lines between these vertices. But I have no idea how to implement this.. Does anyone have a good solution p
Negative 53 pI am looking for open source shopping cart solutions which provides the following two features together  multi seller support and contact a seller.p  pAmazon, Ebay etc provides such features. Flipkart does not. This is like an internal inbox inside the shopping cart portal. The buyer can also attach documents, images with his message to the seller. The message is usually something regarding the product the buyer just purchased from the seller.p  pOpencart has something called sms to vendor, which doesnt seem to serve the purpose. Magento might have something similar, but I am unable to find much information about the same.p  pGuys, your helpful input on this issue would be valued. Thanks in advancep

What this means is that you have at all times 300 threads available for blocking database actions or 300 requests per second at max also if I had more resources to the server like more Ram,CPU or cores does that increase the amount of threads available For example if I buy a server that has 4 cores or etc.. would the available threads jump to 1,200  As stated before all my actions are blocking from user registration to user chats so trying to get my misconceptions out now before they become more costly.p
