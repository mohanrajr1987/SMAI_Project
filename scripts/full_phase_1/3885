Does something like this existpli lipRead the contents of the outline view, and maybe simulate a double click on one of the Outline views entries.

However, parsing the java source code within is a massive task, so this approach probably wont work.pli lipUse outline.getCurrentPage, which is a JavaOutlinePage, but I cant seem to import that class. Im guessing I need to pull in the entire JDT project to do that. This approach also means Im tied to a specific language, when I want my goToNthMethod to be language agnostic.pli ol  pAny ideas on how I can jump to the nth method Thanksp  pSome context Im integrating Dragon NaturallySpeaking with eclipse to be able to program with my voice. Its working well so far, but one tedious part is navigating around the file, which would be made easier if I could say go to 8th method. In fact, just go to 8th entry to just go to the 8th row in the outline view would be sufficient. Any other ideas appreciatedp
Positive 3885 pit sounds like the entire contents of the Package Explorer view is exposed via the Common Navigator Framework.p  pHow can I access this data though I want to see the names of all the projects, files, and methods within.

It then goes on to try to find other things to return, but it takes into account the object I pass in, and proceeds to not work. I havent a clue whats going on.p  pAll the documentation Ive found focuses on adding a new view using the CNF, but not looking at the workspaces existing contents. Is there any good documentation for this Thanksp

At first this seemed to work very well, but we have run into trouble when read accessing these preferences in multithreaded scenarios while at the same time changes are being made to the workspace.

In such cases we get a pretty mix of p  ul licodeorg.osgi.service.prefs.BackingStoreExceptioncodeli licodejava.io.FileNotFoundExceptioncodeli licodeorg.eclipse.core.runtime.CoreExceptioncodeli ul  pEssentially they all complain that the underlying file is no longer there.p  pInitial attempts to emfixem this using checks like codeIProject.existscode or codeisAccessiblecode and even going so far as checking the presence of the actual .prefs file were as futile as expected They only make the exceptions less likely but do not really prevent them.p  pSo my question is How are you supposed to safely access things like codeProjectScope.getNodecode Do you need to go so far to put every read into a codeWorkspaceJobcode or is there some other, clever way to prevent the above problems like putting the read access in codeDisplay.asyncExeccodep  pAlthough I tried, I did not really find answers to the above question in the Eclipse documentation.p

Still everything hangs.p  pI think that there must be something about a plugin project that puts something dangerous on the build path.  I tried putting project A at the very bottom below the JRE put it still causes this behavior.p  pIm guessing that I could work around the problem by separating the project A into two parts, but thats annoying.p
Negative 3885 pAs a petproject, Id like to attempt to implement a basic language of my own design that can be used as a webscripting language. Its trivial to run a C program as an Apache CGI, so the real work lies in how to parse an input file containing noncode HTMLCSS markup and serverside code.p  pIn my undergrad compiler course, we used a hrefhttpwww.gnu.orgsoftwareflex relnofollowFlexa and a hrefhttpwww.gnu.orgsoftwarebison relnofollowBisona to generate a scanner and a parser for a simple language. We were given a copy of the grammar and wrote a parser that translated the simple language to a simple assembly for a virtual machine. The flex scanner tokenizes the input, and passes the tokens to the Bison parser.p  pThe difference between that and what Id like to do is that like PHP, this language could have plain HTML markup and the scripting language interspersed like the followingp  precodeltpgtHello, lt echo World gt ltpgt codepre  pAm I incorrect in assuming that it would be efficient to parse the input file as followsp  ol liScan input until a script start tag is found  liSecond scanner tokenizes the serverside script section of the input file from the open tag  and passes the token to the parser, which has no need to know about the markup in the file.li liControl is returned to the first scanner that continues this general pattern.li ol  pBasically, the first scanner only differentiates between Markup which is returned directly to the browser unmodified and code, which is passed to the second scanner, which in turn tokenizes the code and passes the tokens to the parser. p  pIf this is emnotem a solid design pattern, how do languages such as PHP handle scanning input and parsing code efficientlyp

Negative 3885 pI am not an experimented user of SCM tools, even though I am convinced of their usefulness, of course. I used some obscure commercial tool in a former job, Perforce in the current one, and played a bit with TortoiseSVN for my little personal projects, but I disliked having lot of .svn folders all over the place, making searches, backups and such more difficult. Then I discovered the interest of distributed SCM and I chose to go the apparently simpler than git Mercurial way, still for my personal, individual needs. I am in the process of learning to use it properly, having read part of the wiki and being in the middle of the excellent PDF book.p  pI see often repeated, for example in a hrefhttpwww.selenic.commercurialwikiindex.cgiWorkingPracticeshighlight28practices29 relnofollow titleMercurial working practicesMercurial working practicesa, emdont hesitate to use multiple trees locally. Mercurial makes this fast and lightweight.em and emfor each feature you work on, create a new tree.em. These are interesting and sensible advices, but they hurt a bit my little habits with centralized SCM, where we have a holy central repository where branches are carefully planned and handled by administrators, changelists must be checked by senior peers and must not break the builds, etc.  Starting to work on a new branch takes quite some time...p  pSo I have two questions in the light of abovep  ul lipHow practical is it to do lot of clones, in the context of IDEs and such What if the project has configurationsettings files, makefiles or Ant scripts or shell scripts or whatever, needing path updates yes, probably a bad idea... For example, in Eclipse, if I want to compile and run a clone, I have to do yet another project, tweaking the Java build path, the RunDebug targets, and so on. Unless an Eclipse plugin ease that task. Do I miss some facility herepli lipHow do that scale I have read Hg is OK for large code bases, but I am perplex. At my job, we have a Java application well, several around a big common kernel of some 2 millions of lines, weighting some 110MB for code alone. Doing a clean compile on my old 2004 Windows workstation takes some 15 minutes to generate the 50MB of class files I dont see myself cloning the whole project to change 3 files. So what are the practices herepli ul  pI havent yet seen these questions addressed in my readings, so I hope this will make a useful thread.p

Negative 3885 pMy company has recently put up a demo database on his remote servers to allow some of our partners to test our beta version of the software.  p  pWe noticed, as expected, some bottlenecks in some parts of the program, in particular on the places in which many queries are done.  p  pFor example, I have to load emcustomerem from database, with all his emproductsem associated to him.  p  pNormally this operation would be done as  p  ul licodeselect somefields from customers where id  someIdcodeli liStore it to business classli licodeselect someotherfiels from products where customerid  previousidcodeli listore to collection and showuse them.li ul  pImagine a much more complex business logic, which would gather 8 to 12 tables in the same way. With a local database, this would be instant. But by connecting to a remotely hosted SQL Server, this is extremely slow.p  pWe found out that making a single query, like  p  precodeSELECT Customer.Field1, Customer.Field2, Product.Field1, Product.Field2,        LIST OTHER 200 FIELDS FROM 10 DIFFERENT TABLE SE SAME WAY  FROM Customer LEFT JOIN Product ON Product.IdCustomer  Customer.IdCustomer LEFT JOIN OTHER 10 TABLES THE SAME WAY WHERE Customer.IdCustomer  10 codepre  pamazingly improved the speed of the whole execution.br  The fact that this is more complex than the single selects of each of them doesnt compare to the fact that is only strongonestrong access to the server.br  I am talking about 20003000ms to 80120ms.  p  pHere comes the true problem sorry about the long preface. How can i emsaveem data to a remote SQL Server in an efficient way  p  pImagine i have a windowformdialogframewhatever where i ought to save more tables after a given operation.  p  pFor example  p  ul licodeINSERT INTO Customer Field VALUES hello worldcode  IdCustomer is an identity columnli liFetch the new Id from databaseli licodeINSERT INTO SomeLinkedTable IdCustomer, Field VALUES x, new valuecodeli liFetch new IdSomeLinkedTable, use it to link some table, ecc ecc..li ul  pThis is a common way of multiple saving in our program. Even if we dont leave the user without some message that the operation is gonna take a while, waiting 10s to do a frequent multiinsert operation is way too much.  p  pMaybe its a simple server configuration problem, but i swear all the firewalls in both sides our amp server are properly configured to allow some SQL Server access.p  pAnyone encountered the same problem p

Negative 3885 pIn my application I am executing 10 asynchronous NSURLConnections within an NSOperationQueue as NSInvocationOperations.  In order to prevent each operation from returning before the connection has had a chance to finish I call CFRunLoopRun as seen herep  precode voidconnectInBackgroundNSURLRequestURLRequest   TTURLConnection connection  [[TTURLConnection alloc] initWithRequestURLRequest delegateself]    Prevent the thread from exiting while the asynchronous connection completes the work.  Delegate methods will   continue the run loop when the connection is finished.  CFRunLoopRun   [connection release]  codepre  pOnce the connection finishes, the final connection delegate selector calls CFRunLoopStopCFRunLoopGetCurrent to resume the execution in connectInBackground, allowing it to return normallyp  precode voidconnectionDidFinishLoadingNSURLConnection connection      TTURLConnection ttConnection  TTURLConnectionconnection     ...      Resume execution where CFRunLoopRun was called.     CFRunLoopStopCFRunLoopGetCurrent    voidconnectionNSURLConnection connection didFailWithErrorNSError error        TTURLConnection ttConnection  TTURLConnectionconnection     ...      Resume execution where CFRunLoopRun was called.  CFRunLoopStopCFRunLoopGetCurrent  codepre  pThis works well and it is thread safe because I bundled each connections response and data as instance variables in the TTURLConnection subclass.p  pNSOperationQueue claims that leaving its maximum number of concurrent operations as NSOperationQueueDefaultMaxConcurrentOperationCount allows it to adjust the number of operations dynamically, however, in this case it always decides that 1 is enough.  Since that is not what I want, I have changed the maximum number to 10 and it seriously hauls now.p  pThe problem with this is that these threads with the help of SpringBoard and DTMobileIS consume all of the available CPU time and cause the main thread to become latent.  In other words, once the CPU is 100 utilized, the main thread is not processing UI events as fast as it needs to in order to maintain a smooth UI.  Specifically, table view scrolling becomes jittery.p  precodeProcess Name   CPU SpringBoard   45.1 MyApp         33.8 DTMobileIS    12.2 ... codepre  pWhile the user interacts with the screen or the table is scrolling the main threads priority becomes 1.0 the highest possible and its run loop mode becomes UIEventTrackingMode.  Each of the operations threads are 0.5 priority by default and the asynchronous connections run in the NSDefaultRunLoopMode.  Due to my limited understanding of how threads and their run loops interact based on priorities and modes, I am stumped.p  pIs there a way to safely consume all available CPU time in my apps background threads while still guaranteeing that its main thread is given as much of the CPU as it needs  Perhaps by forcing the main thread to run as often as it needs to I thought thread priorities would have taken care of that.p  pstrongUPDATE 1223strong I have finally started getting a handle on the CPU Sampler and found most of the reasons why the UI was becoming jittery.  First of all, my software was calling a library which had mutual exclusion semaphores.  These locks were blocking the main thread for short periods of time causing the scroll to skip slightly.p  pIn addition, I found some expensive NSFileManager calls and md5 hashing functions which were taking too much time to run.  Allocating big objects too frequently caused some other performance hits in the main thread.p  pI have begun to resolve these issues and the performance is already much better than before.  I have 5 simultaneous connections and the scrolling is smooth, but I still have more work to do.  I am planning to write a guide on how to use the CPU Sampler to detect and fix issues that affect the main threads performance.  Thanks for the comments so far, they were helpfulp  pstrongUPDATE 1142010strong After achieving acceptable performance I began to realize that the CFNetwork framework was leaking memory occasionally.  Exceptions were randomly however, rarely being raised inside CFNetwork too  I tried everything I could to avoid those problems but nothing worked.  I am quite sure that the issues are due to defects within NSURLConnection itself.  I wrote test programs which did nothing except exercise NSURLConnection and they were still crashing and leaking.p  pUltimately I replaced NSURLConnection with a hrefhttpallseeingi.comASIHTTPRequestASIHTTPRequesta and the crashing stopped entirely.  CFNetwork emalmostem never leaks, however, there is still one very rare leak which occurs when resolving a DNS name.  I am quite satisfied now.  Hopefully this information saves you some timep

Negative 3885 pPlease have a look at this demo page that I cooked up a while agop  pa hrefhttpwww.s3maphor3.orgdemohotbox relnofollowhttpwww.s3maphor3.orgdemohotboxap  pThis is a custom lightbox that is triggered upon holding the space key. The way it works is quite simple. There are two hidden divs on the page, one for the content of the lightbox and one that holds the darken layer opacity 70. The zindex of the darken layer is one less than that of the lightbox. Upon holding the space key, a simple jQuery script does a .show on both divs.p  pThis demo works fine, but it broke down when I used it in another project IE7 and 8 did not show a 70 dark layer, instead it shows a solid black background.  I spend many hours trying to check the differences between the original demo that works and the version I use in the other project. Eventually I nailed it the difference is in the jQuery version.p  pThe original demo uses jQuery 1.3.1 whilst in my new project Im using jQuery 1.4.2. Something must have changed in the new jQuery library, but Im having a hard time finding out what and how to work around it. I can stay on 1.3.1 but eventually I will have to fix this somehow.p

That URL does indeed redirect, but if I change it to a hrefhttpmini.milli.notonjemain relnofollowhttpmini.milli.notonjemaina which doesnt redirect, it still doesnt work.

Negative 3885 pFrom the SEO standpoint it is nice to see urls in format which explains what is located on a page Lets have a look on such situation it is just example We need to display page about some product and decided to have such url template for that page codeproductProductIdProductCategoryProductUrlNamecode.  And create for this purpose such modelp  precodepublic class ProductUrlInfo    public int ProductIdgetset    public string ProductCountrygetset    public string ProductUrlNamegetset  codepre  pI want to create controller method where I pass ProductUrlInfo object but not all required fields. Classic controller method for url template shown above is followingp  precodepublic ActionResult Indexint ProductId, string ProductCategory, string ProductUrlName     return View  codepre  pand we need to call it like that  codeHtml.ActionLinkltUserControllergtxgtIndexuser.ProductId, user.ProductCategory, user.ProductUrlName, See user pagecodep  pI want to create such controller methodp  precodepublic ActionResult IndexProductUrlInfo productInfo     return View  codepre  pand call it like that codeHtml.ActionLinkltProductControllergtxgtIndexproduct, See product pagecodep  pActually I works when we add one more route and point it to the same controller method, so routing will be code productproductInfo productProductIdProductCategoryProductUrlNamecode In this situation routing engine gets string method of our model need to override it and it works ALMOST always. But sometimes it fails and show url like pageproductInfoCarsPorsche911p  pSo my workaround does not always work properly. Does anybody know how to work with urls in such wayp  pstrongEditstrong Maybe it was unclear, sorry... ProductUrlInfo is strongNOTstrong a view model. That is an object which created just to be shown in the url ONLY. Example of all object for such productp  precodepublic class ProductList ListltProductgt  public class Product    public int ProductIdgetset    public string ProductCountrygetset    public string ProductNamegetset    public string Heightgetset    public float Pricegetset     data which must be rendered in the url string    public ProductUrlInfo Key       return new ProductUrlInfo         ProductId  this.ProductId         ,ProductCountry  MyConverter.EncodeForUrlthis.ProductCountry         ,ProductUrlName MyConverter.EncodeForUrlthis.ProductName              codepre  pSomewhere on a View control p  precodeforeach var pr in Model    Html.RenderActionLinkltProductControllergtxgtIndexpr.Key, See product page codepre  pController methods should be like thisp  precodeaccept our complex object as a key public ActionResult IndexProductUrlInfo key     retrive data from database or any other stuff     Product pr  Repository.GetProductByKeykey     return Viewpr   accept our complex object as a key public ActionResult EditProductUrlInfo key     retrive data from database or any other stuff     Product pr  Repository.GetProductByKeykey     return Viewpr   [HttpPost] public ActionResult EditProduct product     do update here  codepre  pLet me explain how it passed to  codeIndexProductUrlInfo keycode controller method. I think that Im using some side effect. But at first if you have several items you want to pass to controller and actually only single item is object primary key i.e. object ID and other elements just explain user which page he has opened some additional information i.e. object category and name. So in a future you might want to change this information add new fields remove old etc. But if you have links to that page from all over the project then it may be quite painful to completely replace links to new format. So why not pass to controller some model which then be rendered into url I investigated that if you can do following steps to pass custom object to controller 1. create class which contains all required fields to be shown in url  ProductUrlInfo class herep  ol lipregister route with your actually passed object in my particular case it is emkeyem pli liphere some magic. Register AFTER that your desired url format routes emidCategoryProductUrlNameem and for example emidProductUrlNameem You might want to  render only name if it is unknown its category for some reasonpli lipoverride codeToStringcode method in codeProductUrlInfocode class and it must render your desired url format. i.e.p  ppublic override string ToStringbr br   return String.IsNullOrEmptyCategorybr     string.Format 012, Id, Category, ProductUrlName br     string.Format 01, Id, ProductUrlName  p  pAs I do understand that effect when routing engine gets passed object it looks for appropriate route and found key string. Then it found that passed object is a complex type and calls its ToString method. But its not  blindly set result instead of key parameter but also compares it  against routes. Now if you pass ProductUrlInfo into ActionLink as a parameter you will be tranfered to  IndexProductUrlInfo key controller method.  Of course it looks for me as a hack so Id like to know is there anybody who passes objects into GET controller method but in some other better waypli ol

When building our application, were looking at link times between 40 seconds and 2 minutes, depending on machine configuration SSD vs HDD and if stuff is already in Windows disk cache.

I know the text is there, as I said, because I can mouseover the alert box and see the cursor change, and then double click and copypaste the text.p  pI have a suspicion that this is related to another problem I am having in the same project described here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3544369autocompleteinflex40notdisplayingitemsindropdownlisthttpstackoverflow.comquestions3544369autocompleteinflex40notdisplayingitemsindropdownlistap  pBoth of these controls seem to have text that is invisible, as if the text color is set the same as the background. I have tried to look for other style files, theme files or something in the project that would be responsible for setting these colors. But couldnt find any. The project is relatively simple with one mxml, 3 .as files, one of which has validation logic and the other one has a wait anmiation. The third one has business logic code, but nothing to do with colors or themes. The other controls in the project  text boxes, buttons, datagridsl, panels all work fine. Its the autocomplete box and the alert box that seem to not want to display text that is there.p  pAny ideas or hints of what might be the cause of the problemp

Negative 3885 pI am creating a new project type using MPF.p  pI want to create a type of node where the backing for that node doesnt actually exist anywhere.  To keep it simple, I just want to generate the captions on the fly.p  pI have created a new node subclass from HierarchyNode because it will eventually have children.  I have subclassed the FolderNode so I can determine which folders will have these virtual nodes as children.  I am using GetSetMetadata to do that and it works fine.  I overrode GetProperty in MyFolderNode so that if the folder type is a normal folder, it just routes to base.  Otherwise it returns a VirtualNode for FirstChild.  The VirtualNodes create their next sibling and set NextSibling to it.  TLDR Code follows.p  pMy problem is that it isnt working. Specifically, when I click on the Expand this folder icon, it turns blue so the click is registering but it stays blue and the node isnt expanded.

Negative 3885 pI am trying to develop a piece of code in Java, that will be able to process large amounts of data fetched by JDBC driver from SQL database and then persisted back to DB. p  pI thought of creating a manager containing one reader thread, one writer thread and customizable number of worker threads processing data. The reader thread would read data to DTOs and pass them to a Queue labled ready for processing. Worker threads would process DTOs and put processed objects to another queue labeld ready for persistence. The writer thread would persist data back to DB. Is such an approach optimal Or perhaps I should allow more readers for fetching data Are there any ready libraries in Java for doing this sort of thing I am not aware ofp

Negative 3885 pThe subject is distributed computing, but Im not entirely sure whether this is what Im after. p  pWe have a system that has been written in .NET 4 to run on a dedicated Windows Server. We would like to make some savings and move away from dedicated server.p  pIn brief, our system can be split into two modules    1. First module requires a variety of Windows applications to be installed on a server    2. Second module is a website written in .NET with AJAXjQuery and it doesnt require a dedicated windows server.p  pOur idea is to write some sort of service where first module will run on one of our internal servers. Once data is processed, it will be somehow moved to a second module. My immediate worries are related to security and performance. p  pFinally, another problem is that first module requires a constant access to one of the databases in the second module, so any slight connection issue is likely to cause a lot of problems.p  pI have tried searching on here for similar questions, but I dont really know what to look for.p  pIf our idea is feasible, is this really worth the effort It appears that developing and testing this will take longer i.e. cost more than paying for a dedicated server. Having said that, 100 per month dedicated server will be nowhere near powerful enough to run first module of our system. P4 with 12 GB RAM wont cut it...p  pThank youp  pstrongEditstrongp  pI guess that alternative is to do a bulk insert through WCF. Did anybody try to do something similar before Im concerned that a size of bulk insert will be between 20MB and 40MB, any slight network problem is likely to kill the insert.p

We simply add our stored procedures to the model and let them return autogenerated Complex Types. The ability to update the model from the database is also a big plus.p  pBefore we start migrating any of our many projects to Entity Framework, I was wondering if there are any other options that we should look at. My team has no strong preference between ORM libraries or Code Generators.p  pSome of the criteria that might helpp  ol liAll data access including CRUD is performed through Stored Procedures on SQL Server 2008R2. strongPlease dont answer stop using stored proceduresstrong.

Negative 3885 pIm bit of a noob in the sharepoint world, so please bear with any stupidity that might follow...p  pOur company has a bugs database that is based on Microsofts 40 Sharepoint Templates bugs database, but a few customisations have been made to the deployed template before I started here. I have been tasked with deploying a secondary bugs database for a different project that we are running, however all the customisations made to the original deployment will still apply. So rather than deploy the original MS template again and attempt to recreate all the customisations, I though it would be easier to save a template from the existing site. I did not included content when creating this template, as the existing records are irrelevant to the new database, plus there is a large amount of data and sharepoint complains about the size limit being exceeded.p  pAfter creating a new site through central admin, using the custom template I created, I have a problem with the Resolve Bug Resolve.aspx screen. It doesnt display anything but the  header, no form fields and no buttons. If I look at the site with Sharepoint designer, it indicates that I have altered this file but I havent made any changes to it. If I look at it in desgin view, it does look empty and doesnt have the default web part items that appear if I look at any of the other pages. I have tried to copy code out of the original sites aspx page into the new one, but that just causes the page to say its Unable to display this Web Part. I even tried unzipping the orignal templates wsp file and copying the entire Resolve.aspx into the new site, but to no avail. p  pHas anybody had a similar problem before or got any thoughts on how to fix it Any help would be appreciated.p

Negative 3885 pI am fairly new to asp.net webforms so I am open to suggestions of any kind.p  pI am listing products with a repeater. With every product the  looks something like thisp  precodeltItemTemplategt    ltdiv classactionbuttonnormal actionbuttoncart onmouseoveractnbuthoverthis onmouseoutactnbutoutthis onclickactnbutclickthisgt       ltaspCheckBox Checkedfalse classactnboxhidden IDchkCart runatserver AutoPostBackTrue gt    ltdivgt ltItemTemplategt codepre  pAs you can see the checkbox itself is hidden and it is used to represent the state of the icon. I modify the checkboxs Checked attribute in javascript in the actnbutclick function. The problem with this is that checking the box in javascript does not activate the autopostback, and I think it does not even make it into the viewstate, but Im not sure. I tried to post back manually but Im not able to figure out how to do it properly as the checkboxs ID is generated by the repeater.p  pAll in all I want this functionality there are a few items, under them are buttons favorite, add to cart, select for comparsion, etc with nice hover and click animations on them. If I click them I want serverside logic to be executed depending on which button I clicked under which item, for example add to cart should add the specific item to the cart panel, or clicking on fav should access the database and increment the items fav value by one, and add the item to the users favorites, but preserving the state of the objects on the page, including the buttons state clicked or not.p  pWhich would be the best way to do thisp

Negative 3885 pI would like to do a lot of inserts, but could it be possible to update mysql after a while.p  pFor example if there is a query such as p  precodeUpdate viewstable SET views  views  1 WHERE id  12 codepre  pCould it not be possible to maybe store this query until the views have gone up to 100 and then run the following instead of running the query from above 100 times.p  precodeUpdate viewstable SET views  views  100 WHERE id  12 codepre  pNow, lets say that is done, then comes the problem of data integrity. Lets say, there are 100 php files open which are all about to run the same query. Now unless there is a locking mechanism on incrementing the cached views, there is a possibility that multiple files may have a same value of the cached view, so lets say process 1 may have 25 cached views and php process 2 may have 25 views and process 3 may have 27 views from the file. Now lets say process 3 finishes and increments the counter to 28. Then lets say php process is about finish and it finished just after process 3, which means that the counter would be brought back down to 26.p  pSo do you guys have any solutions that are fast but are data secure as well.p  pThanksp

Negative 3885 pI have a jQueryUi Modal dialog up and running correctly based on an Asp.Net MVC3 partial view.  For all but one of the fields, pressing the CANCEL button does what is expected.  The button click handler function in the dialog options is called and dialog.close is called.  You can see it at a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netphototomYA87Y6 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netphototomYA87Y6a.  p  pWhen any field is for entry is clicked on, there is some JavaScript that runs that highlights the label and the input control by adding a css class tag to the table row that both are in. p  pLast Name field is different in that it is a textarea control with some events attached dynamically for displaying the number of reaming characters the user can enter.  Pressing the CANCEL button while this field has focus, initially causes the field to loose focus and the function on the CANCEL button function in the dialog options is not called.  The second time you press the CANCEL button, the dialog will close properly. p  pAny suggestions as to what the problem may be  p

Negative 3885 pIm new to MODx, but am quite impressed with its power and flexibility. Theres only one caveat, and Im hoping its just because I dont know any better.p  pIm a frontend dev, and Im used to building websites of all sizes. But I usually work with files and version control. How would I keep this paradigm with MODxp  pFrom my poking around so far, the only way I found to use an IDE, is to keep static files with my code, to later on copypaste into MODx Manager. Far from ideal.p  pIm aware that a lot of people use an include snippet, to include snippets, chunks, etc. Does this work for MODx specific tags For example, if I include a file as a snippet, and I have a template variable defined in there or a resource link, would that be properly renderedp  pAlso, is there a performance hit using a snippet by including a file, vs having the snippet code entered into MODx Managerp  pBottom line, how do you develop sites on MODx Where do you enter your code Is there a feature like the Import HTML but for snippets and chunks Is there a way to create new Templates, Documents, Chunks, TVs, etc. without going through the Managerp  pThanks in advancep

Any ideas on how to do it manually in Java such as initializing the cloudwatch, ELB, and autoscale, and set an alarm to monitor the cpu usage I know that this is possible, as amazon actually have java API for that. However I couldnt find any example code on the Amazon website that relates to Cloudwatch, ELB, and autoscale. I just wanna practice with the underlying infrastructures to have a thorough understanding on that, instead of using the Amazon Elastic beanstalk.p

Negative 3885 pI have a winsock IOCP server written in c using TCP IP connections.  I have tested this server locally, using the loopback address with a client simulator.  I have been able to get upwards of 60,000 clients no sweat.  The issue I am having, is when I run the server at my house and the client simulator at a friends house.  Everything works fine up until we hit around 3700 connections, after that every call to connect fails from the client side with a return of 10060 this is the winsock timed out error.  Last night this number was 3700, but it has been around 300 before, and we also saw it near 1000.  But whatever the number is, every time we try to simulate it, it will fail right around that number within 10 or so.p  pBoth computers are using Windows 7 Ultimate.  We have also both modified the TCPIP registry setting MaxTcpConnections to around 16 million.  We also changed the MaxUserPort setting from its 5000 default to 65k.  No useful information is showing up in the event viewer.  We also both watched our resource monitor, and we havent even gotten to 1 network utilization, the CPU is also close to 0 usage as well.p  pWe just got off the phone with our ISP, and they are saying that they are not limiting us in any way but the guy was kinda unsure and ended up hanging up on us anyway after a 30 minute hold time...p  pWe are trying everything to figure this issue out, but cannot come up with the solution.  I would be very greatful if someone out there could give us a hand with this issue.p  pP.S. Both computers are on Verizon FIOS with the same verizon router.  Another thing to note, the server is using WSAAccept and NOT AcceptEx.  The client simulator is attempting to connect over many seconds though, so I am pretty sure the connects are not getting backlogged.  We have tried to change the speed at which the client simulator connects, and no matter what speed it is set to it fails right around the same number each time.p  pUPDATE We simulated 2 separate clients on 2 separate machines on network A.  The server was running on network B.  Each client was only able to connect half about 1600 connections to the server.  We were initially using a port below 1,000, this has been changed to above 50,000.  The router log on both machines showed nothing.  We are both using the Actiontec MI424WR verizon FIOS router.  This leads me to believe the problem is not with the client code.  The server throws no errors and has no unexpected behavior.  Could this be an ISPRouter issuep  pUPDATE The solution has been found.  The verizon router we were using MI424WR revision C is unable to handle any more than 3700 connections, we tested this with a separate set of networks.  Thanks for the help guysp  pThanks  Rick  p

I have algorithms already written in Python that will what I want against a directory containing a large number of text files, but  to do that I will need to extract 10,000 text files from the database  this will have performance issues.p  pIm a rookie with MySQL, so Im not sure if it has any builtin features that do ngram analysis, or whether there are good plugins out there that would do it.  Please note that I need to go up to at least 4grams preferably 5grams in my analysis, so the simple 2gram plugins Ive seen wont work here.  I also need to have the ability to remove the stopwords from the textual documents before doing the ngram counting.p  pAny ideas from the communityp  pThanks,p  pRonp

Negative 3885 pI am trying to embed Python 2.6 into MATLAB 7.12.  I wanted to embed with a mex file written in C.  This worked fine for small simple examples using scalars.  However, if Numpy 1.6.1 is imported in anyway MATLAB crashes.  I say anyway because I have tried a number of ways to load the numpy libraries includingp  ol lipIn the python module .pyp  precodefrom numpy import  codepreli lipWith codePyRunSimpleStringcode in the mex filep  precodePyRunSimpleStringfrom numpy import  codepreli lipCalling numpy functions with codePyoBjectCallObjectcodep  precodepOut   PyObjectCallObjectpFunc, pArgs  codepreli ol  pOriginally, I thought this may be a problem with embedding Numpy in C.  However, Numpy works fine when embedded in simple C files that are compiled from the command line with MD multithread switch with the Visual Studios 2005 C compiler.   Next, I thought I will just change the make file in MATLAB to include the MD switch.  No such luck, mexopts.bat compiles with the MD switch.  I also manually commented out lines in the Numpy init module to find what was crashing MATLAB.  It seems that loading any file with the extension pyd crashes MATLAB.  The first of such files loaded in NumPy is multiarray.pyd.   The MATLAB documentation describes how to debug mex files with visual studios which I did and placed the error message below.  At this point I know the problem is a memory problem with the pyds and some conflict with MATLAB.  Interestingly, I can use a system command in MATLAB to kick off a process in python that uses numpy and no error is generated.  I will paste below the error message from MATLAB followed by the DEBUG output in visual studios of the processes that crash MATLAB.  However, I am not pasting the whole thing because the list of firstchance exceptions is very long.

Because the Andoird emulator takes no TCP Packets larger then 1500b or less, I need to be able to chunk packets on the server side.

Negative 3885 pI am trying to create a mini progress bar that will indicate how much data a user has used. It doesnt even need to animate, I just need it to change in size based on a variable I have set up. So when I load up the screen, how much of the progress bar is filled up will depend on a variable I have set up in Java.p  pI have managed to get this working horizontally by usingp  precodescale   new ScaleAnimation0.0f, 1.5f, 1.0f, 1.0f,1.0f, 1.0f codepre  pThis will start the image from nothing and stretching out to its full size, so I can use it as a horizontal progress bar which is great. p  pNow I woulda thought doing this vertically instead would be a simple matter of just changing the fromY to 0 and the toY to the new size I want. However when I do this, by changing the fromY to 0.0f and the toY to 2.0f, the image actually moves and stretches at the same time rather than stretching. Also the image moves position for some reason. It starts off higher up than where I positioned in using XML, and moves down to the original position and stretches out to the new scale I set up.p  pThe code I use to try and stretch it vertically isp  precodescale   new ScaleAnimation1.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f, 2.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f codepre  pSo can someone please explain why it stretches horizontally fine, but when I try to stretch it vertically, it suddenly moves and stretchs at the same time.p  pWould be very grateful for any help.p

Negative 3885 pWhen I moved from Visual Studio 2008 to Visual Studio 2010, there seems to only be a small section of pointing space for the mouse to click and drag and click again, to grab a few lines of code.  This is about 8 pixels wide and is referred to as the Selection Margin.  I often used this area in Visual Studio 2008 to selectcopypaste code.  Now I have to rely on using the keyboard, which is not difficult, but if Im using the mouse, Visual Studio is not very intuitive or usable.  Is there a way to prevent the highlighting of lexical groups where the expandcollapse or plusminus sections are so I can just select the lines of code instead  They seem to call this block highlighting.  Most of the surface area to the left of the text in Visual Studio 2010 seems to be dedicated to the block highlighting.  The text editor freezes when a lexical block of code is highlighted and I cannot use the right context menu.  The right context menu is also only available from inside the text editor now, so I have to select my lines in that 8 pixel region, then move my mouse over to the right to copy.  My productivity in Visual Studio 2010 has decreased substantially because of this change.p  pIm wondering if anyone has written any extensions with the Visual Studio 2010 editor to fix these issuesbr a hrefhttpwww.codeproject.comKBmacrosWriteExtensions.aspx relnofollowhttpwww.codeproject.comKBmacrosWriteExtensions.aspxap

Negative 3885 pI am working on a domain model using Hibernate for a new project.  I have an entity that is basically made up of a codelongNameStringcode, codeshortNameStringcode and codeotherNamesCollectionltStringgtcode.p  pI have been able to set this up fine, but I now want to work on some DAO features that will allow a user to find an Entity by Example, i.e. I should be able to create an Entity object and set some of the fields, then when I pass this into the search it should return a list of results that match the fields that have been set.  I know I can do this using Hibernate codeExamplecodes.p  precodepublic ListltEntitygt findByExampleEntityexampleObject      try          Criteria criteria  getSession.createCriteriatype         Example example  Example.createexampleObject.ignoreCase         criteria.addexample          SuppressWarningsunchecked         ListltEntitygt list  criteria.list         return list      catch HibernateException he          return null       codepre  pBut according to my experience and the documentation, Associations are ignored when doing this.  So my collection of Strings for otherNames is ignored because it is represented in the database as an association onetomany.p  pIdeally I would like to be able to create an Entity Object and add an codeotherNamecode to it, then I would be able to find any Entities where one of their Collection of codeotherNamecodes matches the argument.p  pI tried doingp  precodeSortedSetltStringgt names  exampleObject.getNames if names  null ampamp names.isEmpty      Criteria newCriteria  criteria.createCriteriamappedNames     newCriteria.addRestrictions.instring, exampleObject.getNames  codepre  pWhere the String literals here represent the column names used in the DB.  This works in that it does join the tables and return the results where one of the codeotherNamecodes in the DB match the criteria.  But I get duplicates because if an Entity has two other names and the search criteria is looking for both of them then they show up as two results because the join creates two rows representing the same Entity but with each of the two other names. e.g.p  precodeEntity     longNamefoo     shortNamebar     otherNames         a         b codepre  pwill result in two rows for the join ofp  precodefoo, bar, a foo, bar, b codepre  pSo when I do criteria.list it returns two Entity Objects, both of which are the same Object.p  pDoes anyone know of a better way of doing a find by example using Hibernate, where the search actually looks at the association which in this case is a simple association to a Collection of Stringsp

Negative 3885 pI have some tables that contain data about players and the games they have bowled this season in a bowling center during their leagues.

I have all of this down, but I still have a problem in some particular case when some players play in multiple leagues and have more than one of their averages in the top X.p  pObviously, I only want to list the best average for a given player, so if Player A has the best average with 200 in League ABC and also the second best average with 198 in League DEF, I only want the 200 listed.p  pHeres a simplified version of the query that I would like to change, because right now I have to remove the duplicates manually or I would have to write a sorter in another language, but Id rather do it in pure SQL. I only removed irrelevant information from the query for this examplep  precodeSELECT playerId, ROUNDAVGscore,2Average, season, leagueName, COUNTscoreNumGames FROM Scores WHERE season  20112012 AND score gt 1 GROUP BY season, playerID, leagueName ORDER BY Average DESC LIMIT 0,30 codepre  pBasically, the codeScorescode table contains each individual game, a playerId, the season in which the game was played and the leagueName and other columns that are not required in this example.p  pThe codeWHEREcode is to make sure the game was played this season and that the score is positive 1 is for when people are absent. I group everything by season, playerID and leagueName so I get an average PER LEAGUE for each player instead of an average of all the games played in different leagues.p  pI tried using the codeDISTINCTcode keyword, but that doesnt work because I cant use codeDISTINCTcode for only a single column. I also tried other things but none of them came even close to working, so Im wondering if its even possible to do this or if Ill have to resort to using another language to sort this result set and removing duplicatesp

Negative 3885 pThe HTTP protocol has supported multipart responses for a long time. Ive used them before for APIs with appropriately equipped consumers, but it doesnt appear browser support for them is very good, nor has it improved in the last halfdecade. Ive had difficulty finding much information on why this might be. Id love to be able to cut down on HTTP requests by sending all of the assets I know a webapp will need on the initial request, especially for apps that employ clientside frameworks like Backbone.js.p  pAre there any whitepapers, trade articles, failed experiments, or other evidence on why neither browsermakers or webperformance evangelists are paying this longtime HTTP construct any attentionp  pemTo be utterly clear, Im not looking for an opinion, but veritable evidence indicating why this might be. For example, if Mozilla published something about this a few years ago, or there is a closed ticket in the Firefox bug tracker where a lead developer comments about why they wont implement this.emp

Negative 3885 pI have an app built on asp.net MVC  and using twitters bootstrap. In order to get bootstrap styles to work, I have added p  precode.validator.setDefaults     highlight function element          element.closest.controlgroup.addClasserror     ,     unhighlight function element          element.closest.controlgroup.removeClasserror       codepre  pSo far so good. Today I added a cleditor to the site and lost validation on the textarea because cleditor hides it as do all wysiwyg editors. So I added the following code which fixed that.p  precode.validator.setDefaults ignore   codepre  pThen I added a function which does some work on the textarea prior to validation.  This is a required field, so I am testing to see if it only contains spaces, non breaking spaces, and breaks. If so, I clear it so my validation catches it properly.p  precodemyForm.submitfunction       var contents  editor[0].area[0].value     var patt1  new RegExpltbrgtsampnbsp     if contents.matchpatt1         editor[0].area[0].value       return true  codepre  pThis function is triggered before validation, form submission is stopped and the error messages are displayed,  which is all good. The problem, is that the validator defaults that were set above dont get triggered, so the fields arent styled appropriately.p  pStranger still is that if I submit the form a second time, the validator defaults are run and the fields are styled appropriately. p  pI can work around this by creating a custom validation attribute in MVC, but I still would like to know why this is behaving this way, and if I can fix it.p  pAs a side note, the regex I am using above to find combinations of spaces and breaks etc isnt working. I have put it in two regex testers and it works fine. In my app, it doesnt find a match. I am a regex novice, so there is probably a much better way to write that. p

Negative 3885 pEarlier today I was working on a PHP 5.3 application, which meant I was free to use PHP closures. Great I thought Then I ran into a piece of code where the use of functional PHP code would make things a lot easier, but, while I had a logical answer in mind, it made me wonder what the performance impact between directly calling a closure within codearraymapcode and passing it down as a variable. I.e. the following twop  precodetestarray  arraytest, test, test, test, test  arraymap function  item   return item , testarray  codepre  pandp  precodetestarray  arraytest, test, test, test, test  fn  function  item   return item  arraymap fn, testarray  codepre  pAs I had thought, the latter was indeed faster, but the difference wasnt that big. In fact, the difference was 0.05 secs for repeating these same tests 10000 times and taking the average. May have even been a fluke.p  pThis made me even more curious. What about codecreatefunctioncode and closures Again, experience tells me codecreatefunctioncode should be slower when it comes to something like codearraymapcode as it creates a function, evaluates it, and then stores this as well. And again, as I had thought, codecreatefunctioncode was indeed slower. This was all with codearraymapcode.p  pThen, and Im not sure why I did this, but I did, I checked what the difference was between codecreatefunctioncode and closures while saving it and just calling it once. No processing, no nothing, just simply passing a string, and returning that string.p  pThe tests becamep  precodefn  functionitem  return item  fntest codepre  pandp  precodefn  createfunction item, return item  fntest codepre  pI ran both these tests 10000 times each, and looked at the results and got the average. I was quite surprised by the results.p  pTurns out, the closure was about 4x slower this time. This couldnt be I thought. I mean, running a closure through codearraymapcode was much faster, and running the same function through a variable through codearraymapcode was even faster, which was practically the same as this test.p  pThe results werep  precodearray   0 gt      array       test gt string Closure test length12       iterations gt int 10000       time gt float 5.1327705383301E6   1 gt      array       test gt string Anonymous test length14       iterations gt int 10000       time gt float 1.6745710372925E5 codepre  pSo curious as to why it was doing this, I checked the CPU usage and other system resources and made sure nothing unnecessary was running, everything was fine now so I ran the tests again, but I got similar results.p  pSo I tried the same tests only once, and ran it multiple times timing it every time of course. It turns out the closure was indeed 4 times slower, except every now and then it would be about two or three times faster than codecreatefunctioncode, which Im guess were just flukes, but it seemed to be enough to cut the time by half for when I did the tests 1000 times.p  pBelow is the code I used to make these tests.

Negative 3885 pIm reading the textbook Computer Organization And Design by Hennessey and Patterson 4th edition. On page 225 they describe how overflow is detected in signed, 2s complement arithmetic. I just cant even understand what theyre talking about.p  blockquote   pHow do we detect [overflow] when it emdoesem occur Clearly, adding or   substracting two 32bit numbers can yield a result that needs 33 bits   to be fully expressed.p blockquote  pSure. And it wont need 34 bits because even the smallest 34 bit number is twice the smallest 33 bit number, and were adding 32 bit numbers.p  blockquote   pThe lack of a 33rd bit means that when overflow occurs, the sign bit   is set with the emvalueem of the result instead of the proper sign of   the result.p blockquote  pWhat does this mean The sign bit is set with the value of the result... meaning its set as if the result were unsigned And if so, how does that follow from the lack of a 33rd bitp  blockquote   pSince we need just one extra bit, only the sign bit can be wrong.p blockquote  pAnd thats where they lost me completely.p  pWhat Im getting from this is that, when adding signed numbers, theres an overflow if and only if the sign bit is wrong. So if you add two positives and get a negative, or if you add two negatives and get a positive. But I dont understand their explanation.p  pAlso, this only applies to unsigned numbers, right If youre adding signed numbers, surely detecting overflow is much simpler. If the last halfadder of the ALU sets its carry bit, theres an overflow.p  pnote I really dont know what tags are appropriate here, feel free to edit them.p

Negative 3885 pstrongI have a problem that is almost identical to the problem described by this person here, but it hasnt get answeredstrongp  pa hrefhttpwww.cocoabuilder.comarchivecocoa312683coredatanestedmanagedobjectcontextsandfrequentdeadlocks.html312683httpwww.cocoabuilder.comarchivecocoa312683coredatanestedmanagedobjectcontextsandfrequentdeadlocks.html312683ap  pstrongHere is the problemstrongp  pI have a parent MOC setup with NSPrivateQueueConcurrencyType and a persistent store coordinator set, it has a child MOC setup with NSMainQueueConcurrencyType. The idea being most of the long hard work and saves can be done on the private MOC freeing the main thread from blocking the UI. Unfortunately I seem to be running into a couple of situations that cause deadlocks.p  pIf the child MOC on the main thread is performing a fetch with NSFetchedResultsController the parent context is sent an executeFetchRequest it can create a deadlock. Both operations are done within the context of a performBlock for their respective MOCs although the docs seem to indicate that using a main thread concurrency type MOC on the main thread without performBlock is fine.p  pIt appears that the private queue is waiting on the PSCs lock which the child context on the main thread has already locked. It appears that the child context while holding the PSCs lock is trying to dispatchsync to the parent context and thus they are both waiting for each other.p  pIs PriveQueue  MainQueue a supported configuration It seems most people still have the parent context on the main thread.p  pThe main thread looks like thisp  blockquote precodegt 0    0x960f6c5e in semaphorewaittrap  gt 1    0x04956bb5 in dispatchthreadsemaphorewait  gt 2    0x04955c8f in dispatchbarriersyncfslow  gt 3    0x04955dea in dispatchbarriersyncf  gt 4    0x01797de5 in perform  gt 5    0x01798547 in [NSManagedObjectContextNestedContextSupport newValuesForObjectWithIDwithContexterror]  gt 6    0x0176416b in PFFaultHandlerLookupRow  gt 7    0x01763f97 in [NSFaultHandler fulfillFaultwithContextforIndex]  gt 8    0x01763b75 in PFFulfillDeferredFault  gt 9    0x017639f2 in sharedIMPLpvfkcore  gt 10    0x017681a0 in pvfk11  gt 11    0x0001b322 in [FBUser sectionName] at UsersmlinkCodexxFBUser.m62 gt 12    0x011a8813 in NSGetUsingKeyValueGetter  gt 13    0x017a0652 in [NSManagedObject valueForKey]  gt 14    0x011ab8d5 in [NSObjectNSKeyValueCoding valueForKeyPath]  gt 15    0x01851f72 in [NSFetchedResultsControllerPrivateMethods sectionNameForObject]  gt 16    0x01853af6 in [NSFetchedResultsControllerPrivateMethods computeSectionInfoerror]  gt 17    0x01850ea6 in [NSFetchedResultsController performFetch]  gt 18    0x0003a4fc in 62[SYFriendsTableViewController updateFetchedResultsController]blockinvoke0  gt 19    0x01797af3 in developerSubmittedBlockToNSManagedObjectContextPerform  gt 20    0x049554f0 in dispatchmainqueuecallback4CF  gt 21    0x01b3e833 in CFRunLoopRun  gt 22    0x01b3ddb4 in CFRunLoopRunSpecific  gt 23    0x01b3dccb in CFRunLoopRunInMode  gt 24    0x023d6879 in GSEventRunModal  gt 25    0x023d693e in GSEventRun  gt 26    0x0089aa9b in UIApplicationMain  gt 27    0x00002656 in main at UsersmlinkCodexxmain.mm16 codepre blockquote  pthe private queue stack looks like thisp  precode0    0x960f8876 in psynchmutexwait  1    0x97e9e6af in pthreadmutexlock  2    0x0172ec22 in [PFLock lock]  3    0x0172ebfa in [NSPersistentStoreCoordinator lock]  4    0x01746a8c in [NSManagedObjectContextNSInternalAdditions lockObjectStore]  5    0x01745030 in [NSManagedObjectContext executeFetchRequesterror]  6    0x0009d49f in [NSManagedObjectContextAdditions executeFetchRequest] at UsersmlinkCodeobjcCCNSManagedObjectContextAdditions.m44 7    0x0002177f in [FBUser usersForFbidsinManagedObjectContext] at UsersmlinkCodexxFBUser.m435 8    0x00021fc0 in 77[FBUser updateUserFromGraphValuesinManagedObjectContextcompletionHandler]blockinvoke0 at UsersmlinkCodexxFBUser.m461 9    0x0180f9f3 in developerSubmittedBlockToNSManagedObjectContextPerformprivateasync  10    0x04954ecf in dispatchqueuedrain  11    0x04954d28 in dispatchqueueinvoke  12    0x049544af in dispatchworkerthread2  13    0x97ea1b24 in pthreadwqthread  14    0x97ea36fe in startwqthread  codepre  pstrongHe also writes thisstrongp  pIm starting to think the problem is with NSFetchedResultsController which is always stuck at performFetch when these deadlocks occur. Most of the time it will be stuck trying to fault in an object as a result of asking for its section name. As a test I tried to reproduce what the FRC does and performed the executeFetchRequest and then iterated through the results asking each object for its section name. And this doesnt cause a deadlock. If I leave the FRC to do performFetch after I do my test it will still deadlock there. Im 99 sure that the FRC has a synchronization problem with nested contexts.p  pstrongQuestion Does anybody know why this problem occurs Do you know how to solve it Is this a bugstrongp

Negative 3885 pHow does one best retain data within a Fragment as its activity goes through an onCreateDestroy cycle like from Rotationp  pIn our setup we have potentially large lists loaded from our servers into the fragments custom list adapter and we want to smooth out the UX by not making them reload on rotation. The problem we had with setting the fragment retainInstancetrue is that our adapter has a reference to the context of the original activity and would therefore leak memory. Could we just store the data in the fragment and recreate the adapter amd if so is that really proper practice p  pThe next idea is to store the data into a session singleton object and retrieve after rotation which presents a few problems with stale data but we can easily overcome.p  pThe other alternative I see, that seems like it is the best solution, is to save the data into a bundle and restore into the new fragment after rotation However, we have quite a few objects that would need to be stored throughout the app and some of our objects are complex, contain lists, multiple types, and would be a pain to make parcelable. Is there a better solution or do we have to bite the bullet and make them Parcelable p
Negative 3885 pIm trying to handle exceptions in a dialog so that if any exception occurs, the dialog will be closed and the application will not crash.

Error is successfully caught, but when I show the codeMessageBoxcode to the user, codeCanExecutecode executes again, and so the error happens again. In the end it results in application crash.p  pIve googled some info, and it were said to make sure that there is no exceptions in codeCanExecutecode event handler. But something like this can happen somewhere else, and thats why I want to simply catch ALL exceptions in the dialog entry point without working with every method.p  pSo, my question is how to destroy the dialog so that after exception catch it wont show again anymore codeClosecode didnt work, because before closing it still calls codeCanExecutecode.p

Negative 3885 pIm writing a simple Project Management System using C 3.0 and ASP.NET 3.5 with a SQL Server 2008 R2 backend.p  pAt the moment its essentially a data driven application with basic CRUD functionality, a small amount of business logic and some validation. p  pIts anticipated that the system will grow to contain more complex business functionality and I am interested in trying to remodel it using the principles of Domain Driven Design DDD.p  pI realise this is overkill for how the system stands at the moment and I anticipate creating an anemic domain for now. p  pThe system consists of Customers, Clients, Projects, Components and Activities. p  pA Customer has 0,1 or many Clients. A Client has 0,1 or many Projects A Project has 0,1 or many Components and A Component has 0,1 or many Activities.p  pHow would I go about modelling this using DDD Would I have Customer, Client, Project, Component and Activity as Aggregate Roots or would I have one Aggregate Root the Customer and have Client, Project, Component and Activity as entities accessible through Customer Is there a recommended way of modelling many to one relationships between entitiesaggregate rootsp  pI realise this hasnt touched on value objects obviously Customer, Client etc contain several attributes etc. but I am a complete beginner here and would love some pointers as much as a near complete answer.p  pApologies for the open ended nature of the question, I already have a working system but am looking to the future.p  pThanks, Rich.p
Negative 3885 pI use NSMutableData objects to store lists of 32 byte structs that represent series data.  These series are potentially extended, added, aligned, etc.  To save allocation of unnecessary objects I try to extend and append bytes to existing objects rather than allocate new ones.  p  pI noticed some strange behavior in the simulator today 1 using setLength and increaseByLength didnt always zero all new bytes and 2 use of these objects after modification resulted in crashes.  The crashes were all in very different areas but always EXCBADACCESS.  After quite a bit of debugging I ended up allocating new objects for working with via mutableCopy and assigning them to my object attributes when done.  That solved all of the issues I was having.  p  pemem I am working with these objects in background threads but have wrapped all operations in a synchronized block and have not been able to observe any race conditions on the objects in question.p  pHas anyone noticed similar odditiesp  pThanks.p

Negative 3885 pIm working in WinRt calling a WinRt Class Library from a Windows Store App using C and SQLite... objects are returning null reference errors at unexpected times...p  pIm trying to implement a logon service that checks to see if the current user is already logged in by checking if the data file exists, then checking if the user is the current user logged in...p  pThe user can simply enter their ID and click a logon button. It creates a DataService object that wraps a SQLite database and is then injected into the UserStartupService. p  pThe UserStartupService uses Dependency Injection, singleton and implements IDisposable.p  pIssue 1 if the user clicks the logon button a second time, the UserStartupService object constructor does not run and when internal objects are used they throw null reference errors even though it runs through the dispose method after it exits the using block, which forces me to deactivate the logon button, which is a kluge fix at best. A new user has to exit the program to log in as a new user.

Negative 3885 pA pretty simple question which version of CityHash is hidden behind the codeHASHcode function of BigQuery Is it always the latest today v1.1, or rather a fixed versionp  pNow, a little bit of backgroud. I plan on relying heavily upon BigQuery to store large sets of data. From those data, in a first time, I would like to compute some hash value and store it something like codehashedvalue  HASHCONCATcolumn0, column1code. So far so good. In a second time, I would like to retrieve rows with a given hash value with a request such as codeSELECT something FROM [mytable] WHERE hashedvalue  HASHCONCAT12345, foobarcode. My concern here is that it is specified on the CityHash webpage that those functions are not supposed to be backward compatible. So that if BigQuery relies always on the stronglateststrong version of CityHash, I will not be able to retrieve my data based on the hash value of some computed columns after the next CityHash update. And for my application my large database will essentially become useless.p  pIf so, would it be possible to give access to a fixed or backwardcompatible hash function, in addition to codeHASHcode  One on the codeSHAcode, codeMDcode and so on for exemple, or even a fixed version of CityHash.p  pThank you.p

Negative 3885 pIm working on an app where most of the touch gestures will be pan gestures but Im not using a pan gesture recognizer. Im using codeUIGestureRecognizerDelegatecode and using codetouchesBegancode, codetouchesMovedcode, codetouchesEndedcode, and codetouchesCancelledcode. However, there are a couple of spots on the screen where if a pan starts there I want to recognize it as a tap event instead. I can do this by simply recognize the location in touchesBegan. My question is, can I dealloc the touch at that point to prevent the continuation of the pan If a pan starts from this location in the screen, its guaranteed not to really be intended as a pan by the user. I hope this makes sense.p  pEDIT Ive realized the extra overhead of managing a tap even for a point that should be ignored is insignificant, so I think Ill just do that. Ill keep the question here, though, in case there is a way to stop the gesture from continuing to be tracked.p  pI also need a suggestion for how to handle the following situation.p  pSuppose the user starts a pan not in the area just described, but elsewhere where it really is intended to be a pan, and while the pan is proceeding, another pan is started elsewhere on the screen. How do I recognize this situationp  pEDIT I am now testing whether this code will solve this issuep  precode BOOLgestureRecognizerUIGestureRecognizer gestureRecognizer shouldRecognizeSimultaneouslyWithGestureRecognizerUIGestureRecognizer otherGestureRecognizer     return YES  codepre  pEdit ARC forbids explicit dealloc, so now I revise my question to a more general one of what, if anything, I can do to suppress further action. Or do I just have to deal with itp

Negative 3885 pOn a Windows 32bit and 64bit machine, I have to allocate memory to store large amounts of data that are streaming live, a total of around 1GB. If I use malloc, I am going to obtain a virtual memory address, and this address could be actually causing some paging to the hard drive depending on the amount of memory I have. Unfortunately Im afraid that the HD will impact performance and cause data to be missing.p  pIs there a way to force memory to allocate only in RAM, even if it means that I get an error when not enough memory is available so the user needs to close other things or use another machine I want to guarantee that all operations will be done in memory. If this fails, forcing the application to exit is acceptable.p  pI know that another process may come in and itself take some memory, but I am not worried because in this machine that is not happening itll be the only application on the machine to be doing this large allocation.p  p[Edit] My attempt so far has been to try use VirtualLock as followsp  precodeifSetProcessWorkingSetSizethis, 300000, 300008     printfError Changing Working Set Sizen   Allocate 1GB space unsigned long sz  sizeofunsigned char1000000000 unsigned char  mbuffer  unsigned char  mallocsz  ifmbuffer  NULL      printfMemory Allocation failedn  else       Protect memory from being swapped     ifVirtualLockmbuffer , sz                 printfMemory swap protection failedn                  codepre  pBut the change in Working set fails, and so does the VirtualLock.

Negative 3885 pFrom what I understand, it is common practice to run multiple processes via thinphusion to support concurrency with Rails.  Meaning that if you want to to mimick 30 threads, you would have to spawn 30 seperate rails processes running your app.p  pIf the above is correct, does ActiveRecord then support connection pooling or is there only a single connection to mysql  It doesnt make sense to even require more than one connection since each rails process is never serving more than a single request rightp

When I encountered something new, I just asked my good friend strongGooglestrong and most of the times, got a satisfactory answer. Honestly though, I never made much effort. All I know is that codecode is probably a shorthand jQuery object constructor and that codecode and codejQuerycode are the same thing provided jQuery is included.p  pRecently, though, I tried to understand the science behind jQuery and how to write a stronggoodstrong jQuery plugin. I came across a very good a hrefhttpcoding.smashingmagazine.com20111011essentialjquerypluginpatternsarticlea in which the author listed several emtemplatesem for creating a jQuery plugin.

In ES5, undefined can no longer be       modified.       window and document are passed through as local       variables rather than as globals, because this slightly       quickens the resolution process and can be more       efficiently minified especially when both are       regularly referenced in your plugin.

Each bill has around 5 bill items. and when I expand an element at the bottom of the bill panel, bills should auto scroll to show the expanded bill. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comXUXOr.png altenter image description herep

Negative 3885 pMy page consists of an Accordion from Primefaces with 9 categories. In one category I have a table with a width bigger than my screen width.

The problem is that when I leave the specific tab expanded, strongmy whole body cannot scroll down to bottomstrong, but instead it automatically scrolls some pixels above the bottom I lose about one accordion tab header, either when I scroll using mouse wheel or when I scroll using the scrollbar of my whole body I want to point out here that the scrollbar of the whole body is not a custom scrollbar but a common one. If the tab with the custom scrollbar is not expanded, my page works great.p  pThis is my accordion scrolled to the bottom img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comeNHU6.jpg altAccordion scrolled to the bottomp  pAnd this is the most I can scroll my page down, when the accordion tab with the custom scrollbar is expanded img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comShd6z.jpg altAccordion with autoscroll problemp  pAs you can see the body is not fully scrolled to the bottom. strongIf I try to scroll it to the bottom it goes right up to this positionstrong until I collapse the tab which is open.p

Negative 3885 pI have created a visualforce that allows a user to dynamically add rows to insert many child records related to a master record.p  pEach new rows contains 3 lookup fields Account, Contact and User.  The record is a custom object called Participant.  A participant can either be an Account, Contact or User.  p  pIm trying to create some validation that would prevent the user from choosing more than one lookup selection.  For example, if the user select an account, then I dont want them to select a contact or user.  If they select a contact, I dont want them to be able to select an account or user.  If they select user, then I dont want them to be able to select an account or contact.  I thought about a validation rule, but preferably, Id like to validate the form before the records are saved.  Also, there is a use case where the user selects a contact and when they save, I have a trigger that fires and looks up the related account and populates the account lookup field automatically for them for that record row.p  pIve been struggling with how to provide a good user experience to validate this use case.p  pWhat would be the best approach to provide the validationp  pAny design approaches would be appreciated.

Negative 3885 pFirst up, heres the backgroundp  pWe have a Windows Forms application written in C, .NET Framework 3.5 currently running on full Windows 7 tablets, which have a 3G module built in that is used for data connectivity. The data connection is configured as a normal mobile broadband connection in Windows so Windows manages the connectivity itself, and the connection shows up in Control Panel  Network and Internet  Network Connections and it works fine  the application is able to communicate over the internet with our web service. We will be moving onto a different device likely a full Windows 8based tablet at some point in the future.p  pNow, what I need to do is read the connection status of this Mobile Broadband connection i.e. get the signal strength, and the carrier name e.g. Vodafone UK. Ive found a way to do this using the Mobile Broadband API part of the Windows 7 SDK see a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarydd32327128vvs.8529.aspx relnofollowherea and a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuswindowshardwaregg487392.aspx relnofollowherea, however this appears to be OS specific as it doesnt work on Windows 8  or at least not with the device I have here.p  pIs there a generic way to read the mobile broadband connection properties using the .NET frameworkp  pAlternatively, does anyone know of a Windows 8 SDK which contains a Mobile Broadband API like the Windows 7 one Im currently usingp  pThanks in advance.p  pUpdate  Ive got this working on a range of different Win 7  Win 8 devices now. Even the Lenovo device is working OK. Ill post up example code for the main bits Reading connection status, configuring the connection, checking the SIM status as answers the code is a little too long to go into the question, annoyingly.p

Negative 3885 pI recently inherited some IOS app code containing a singleton static objective C class that contains the data shared between various classes in the app. It is very nifty design pattern and I have already taken advantage of it for my additions to the code. The structure of the singleton is very similar to this a hrefhttpgetsetgames.com20090830theobjectivecsingleton relnofollowpostap  pThere is just one thing about it that sortof freaks me out. None of the Objective C Objects that use this singleton import its header file but they all have access to its implementation declared interface. This looks a little like spooky interactions from a distance to me. Type the name of the singleton and xcode helpfully suggests completions for your code statement. When compiled the compiler, smiles on and never complains about a missing declaration. p  pYes, I have checked for imports that import the header, none of them do. I made a simple test class that only included its own header yet there in the methods I can place the singletons name and access anything in it.p  pSo my question is who or what is doing this automatic import Xcode Objective C Little green aliensp

Negative 3885 pI would like to ask for an starting point of what technology or framework to research. p  pWhat I need to accomplish is the followingp  pWe have a Java EE 6 application using JPA for persistance we would like to use a primary database as some sort of scratchpad, where users can insertdelete records according to the tasks they are are given. Then, at the end of the day an administrator will do some kind of check on their work approving or disapproving it. If he approves the work, all changes will be done permanent and the primary database will be synced  replicated to another one for security reasons. Otherwise, if administrator do not approve changes they will be rolled back.p  pNow here I got two problems to figure outp  pFirst. Is it possible to rollback a bunch of JPA operations done through a certain amount of timep  pSecond. Trigger the replication This can be done by RDBMS engines process by code. Now, if RDBMS replication is not possible maybe because of client requirement we would need a sync framework for JPA as a backup. I was looking at some JMS solutions, however not clear about the exact process or how to make them work on JPA.p  pAny help would be greatly appreciated, Thanks.p
Negative 3885 pI have written a C application that reads DataTables from a database SQL Server and exports them to Excel files. Unfortunately, in this database, the columns representing dates are sometimes represented as VARCHAR as opposed to DATETIME.p  pWhen the column data type is DATETIME, the Excel file is generated with the value in my desired format, which is ddmmyyyy. On the other hand, when the data type is VARCHAR, the result is mmddyyyy. I need to fix this.p  pThe problem is that I do now know a priory if a VARCHAR column represents a date, so I should I believe instruct the application to export VARCHAR literally, without doing any conversion the verbatim value on the database is correct.p  pHow can I do this If necessary, I can post the code that writes the Excel starting from the DataTable.p  pThanksp  pGiuseppep

Negative 3885 pI was wondering if there is a way to programmatically create diagrams. For example  I want to create an image of a clock and be able to indicate to the computer what time I want to display on that. It could be that I want to illustrate 20 mins on it. It should be able to portray that information on the clock.p  pIs there a way to do this I think it would be a brilliant if something like this exists already. Or if someone could guide me towards making such a thing, that would be awesome too.p  pThe diagrams eg. clocks, graphs, world maps should be able to portray information and change accordingly to adapt to the information that is entered.p  pI have browsed the web, but have only stumbled upon sites like RaphaelJS. But I dont think that solves my query. Ideally, Id also want to have the diagrams to be in my Android application. Is it possiblep

Negative 3885 pWe are maintaining a website that uses the letters , , and  in some of the page addresses. And this has worked just fine, except for some IEissues early on, up until now. The problem we have gotten this last couple of weeks, is that search engine crawlers, especially Bing, seem to be encoding the letters over and over. p  pSo we get 404errors as the crawler is trying to access the address butikkmC383C692C386E28099C383E280A0C3A2E282ACE284A2C383C692C3A2E282ACC5A1C383E2809AC382C2A3C383C692C386E28099C383C2A2C3A2E2809AC2ACC382C2A0C383C692C382C2A2C383C2A2C3A2E282ACC5A1C382C2ACC383C2A2C3A2E282ACC5BEC382C2A2C383C692C386E28099C383E280A0C3A2E282ACE284A2C383C692C3A2E282ACC5A1C383E2809AC382C2A2C383C692C386E28099C383C2A2C3A2E2809AC2ACC385C2A1C383C692C3A2E282ACC5A1C383E2809AC382C2B8bler, instead of butikkmbler. Using butikkmc3b8bler would also have gotten you to the right page. And as we are using Play Framework, we also get a site error as our controllers can be no longer than 250 characters, but that is not the real issue here.p  pInitially there was no sitemap on the site. We added one, with UTF8 encoded addresses, hoping this would lead the bots the right way, but so far nothing.p  pSo has anybody had some similar issue and solved it, or have some suggestions in what we can do to make Bing Bot use the right addresses Any help would be appreciated.p  pstrongAdded infostrong Having a look at Bing Webmaster Tools, I can see that Bing have both indexed the right address, and a version with  instead of . So my issue can hopefully be solved by removing the faulty address from the index.p

Negative 3885 pI have a menu ListView that has a dynamic SignOut row that should only show when the user is logged in.  The ListView has a drop shadow after it not set as a Footer, but rather as a View following the ListView.  When I remove the SignOut row it disappears, but the size of the ListView does not change, so there is a transparent gap and then the dropshadow.  I am hiding the SignOut row using codesignOutBtn.setVisibilityView.GONEcode I have a reference to the signOutBtn View, which is a RelativeLayout.  Also, I have verified I am not using View.INVISIBLE anywhere since I would expect this behavior using that.p  pThe ListView is using codewrapcontentcode for the height, and I believe this is where the problem lies  the height is being calculated including the SignOut button.  p  pSo, the question is, how can I make the ListView dynamically resize when a row is shown or hidden  I would prefer not to destroy and recreate the View, although that is what I will probably try next, since it is a relatively simple view.p  pPS. I can add code samples if needed.p

Negative 3885 pIm code reviewing a WCF service. In the header of each message we inject data that the service is going to use later to build a connection string to a DB. Thats because the service is going to be used by a number of different sites, each with its own DB that the service has to query.  We use wcf extensibility. We have a custom MessageInspector that, after receiving the request, extracts the data from the message header, creates a context that implements IExtension and adds it to OperationContext.Current.Extensions. Before sending the reply the custom context is removed from the Extencions collection.p  pThis is a fairly common pattern, as discussed herep  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1895732wheretostoredataforcurrentwcfcallisthreadstaticsafeWhere to store data for current WCF call Is ThreadStatic safeap  pand herep  pa hrefhttpsocial.msdn.microsoft.comForumsvstudioenUS319cac6666e84dfe9a82dfd289c9df1fwcfdoesnthavesessionstoragesowhereshouldonestorecallspecificdataforumwcfhttpsocial.msdn.microsoft.comForumsvstudioenUS319cac6666e84dfe9a82dfd289c9df1fwcfdoesnthavesessionstoragesowhereshouldonestorecallspecificdataforumwcfap  pThis all works fine as long as the service receives a request, processes it, sends the reply and receives the next request. But what if the service receives a request and before being able to reply it gets a second request I built a small console application to test it.

Negative 3885 pI am in the planning stage of creating an Android application. There will be 2 different applications for the buyer and seller. Im unsure as to how I will handle notifications. The seller will place a ticket up for sale which will then be sent to the server. The server will then send a notification to the respective buyer apps that they can buy this ticket. Once the buyer has said they will buy the ticket I want the server to then send a notification to the seller app saying that it was bought.p  pThe issue is Im not sure how the server is going to push these notifications to the devices. Should I just have the devices constantly sending requests to query the database to see if anything has changed If it is possible to use a server side application for this what are some options for programming language and ways to go about accomplishing the tasks I need to be done. p  pSo in short I need a server side application that handles sending notifications to devices.

Negative 3885 pI am making a simple map app  I am sending and receiving locations and text on a pubnub channel. When a chat message comes in, I want to use a simple MKAnnotation to draw the chat Im aware this is a horrifying act of UX and I dont care. p  pWhen my app delegate receives a message on the pubnub channel, it calls a method in the main view controller to draw the text message on the map.

Negative 3885 pI have a background function that currently has something like followsp  precodevoid SomeClasssomeFunction      if mutex.tryLock               i want to know the mutex is locked, and then exit the function         return          else              mutex.unlock           QMutexLocker lockermutext       do some stuff that could throw an exception  codepre  pMy dilemma concerns the codemutex.unlockcode and codeQMutextLockercode statement. p  pIf the codemutexcode is locked, then I want to know about it. If its not, then I want lock it. The problem is that I want to use codeQMutexLockercode to lock codemutexcode for the bulk of the function. Its possible that the function could throw an exception, so manually unlocking codemutexcode could be difficult and error prone. p  pThe above solution works but what concerns me is that sometime between the codemutex.unlockcode and the deceleration of codeQMutexLockercode something else could come along and lock the mutex.p  pDoes anyone have any suggestions of a better way to do thisp  pThank you.p

Negative 3885 pI have created a setup project in visual studio 2008. The MSI installer is working perfectly fine. Now, I wan to show a dialog box after the uninstallation process showing the success of the process.

I understand that I can use onpageshow event in the browser to do something with this client side, but I would rather sort this server side if possible.p  pI have all the neccesary controls for direction on the server calls, so if you refresh any of these pages they will redirect you to the logged out home page, but I just cant seem to manage to force these pages to refresh.p  pAny help appreciated as I am just about to stick an icepick in my ear. p  pCheersp
Negative 3885 pIm new here and my questions is of mathematical rather than programming nature where I would like to get a second opinion on whether my approach makes sense.p  pI was trying to find associations between words in my corpus using the function codefindAssocscode, from the codetmcode package. Even though it appears to perform reasonably well on the data available through the package, such as New York Times and US Congress, I was disappointed with its performance on my own, less tidy dataset. It appears to be prone being distorted by rare document that contain several repetitions of the same words which seems to create a strong association between them. Ive found that the cosine measure gives a better picture of how related the terms are, even though based on literature, it only tends to be used to measure the similarity of documents rather than terms.

This measure tend to be used to find similarity between documents rather than terms, but I see no reason why it cant be used to find similarity between words. In a conventional sense, documents are the vectors while terms are the axes and we can detect their similarity based on the angle between these documents. But a Term Document Matrix is a transpose of a Document Term Matrix, and similarly, we can project terms in the document space, i.e. let your documents be the axes and your terms the vectors between which you can measure the angle.

Negative 3885 pHow is this usually done p  pFor example you might have a texture class. This would of course hold the GLuint id, and maybe other fields such as width and height. When the object needs to be copied for whatever reason, a userdefined copy constructor is needed. p  pNow, in the case of an opengl texture, it is possible to copy it to another texture object. But what about shader programs, or FBOs These cant be copied so easily. How do people usually go about doing this Should they be reference counted Should copying be disabled on all objects Should copying be disabled on all objects that cant be copiedp  pWhat is the best way to go about this Thanks in advance for any answers.p

Negative 3885 pYou are given an unsorted array of n integers, and you would like to find if there are any duplicates in the array i.e. any integer appearing more than once. The complexity that ive found O N2  N  N  12p  pIf we limit the input data in order to achieve some best case scenario , how can you limit the input data to achieve a better Big O complexity Describe an algorithm for handling this limited data to find if there are any duplicates. What is the Big O complexityp  pLet says we have an already sorted array of size 2 2 values in the array.  Therefore we wouldnt need to implement any loops for sorting. If both of the numbers in the array are duplicate, we therefore have an O1 complexity which would be better than any other complexity. Remember We are looking for the best casecomplexity, not worse So we have in this case achieved the best case complexity remembering that in the best case the algorithm does not have to work on all data as in the case of bestcase, we can pretty much present the cheat version of an algorithm which may would world extremely fast on some data and may work slower or not work at all, on some data. Our algorithm has 2 elements and we are looking for the duplicate which simple means that the duplicate area would be presented in a single search as we are only comparing 2 elements and as we know, whether the elements match or dont, it will be determined via the use of a single comparison which is constant and therefore the best case complexity is O1. Ive implemented a variety of algorithms, some of which makes sense and others which dont. I would be grateful for possible solutions, answers etc. as I know there are many possibilities but I am struggling at the moment.  Thank you for your timep

Our JavaScript team has loved a similar tool, quoting speedup of 3x for iterating on unit test development.li ul

I would use a codeUITabBarControllercode but I dont want a text label underneath nor an image for the icon  the buttons will be a unicode character.

I was thinking the way to do this would be to apply a tint when the button is tapped, but since there is no sticky selected state for a bar button Im not sure how to do that. p  pIm also not sure how to replace the content in the middle. I was thinking I should create a container, then just make an action method from each button that will codeperformSegueWithIdentifiercode to a different container that will contain the different content. But only one view controller can be embedded  I cant create multiple segues from the container. Im basically trying to simulate a tab bar controller with smaller buttons, no label, and not the entire content on screen gets replaced upon tapping a button.p  pHow would I go about doing this Id like to get the basic layout done in Interface Builder but of course will need some code.

Negative 3885 pIm writing a web service client in PHP. I think that the question below is applicable to APIs in general, but perhaps PHP has specific conventions for this.p  pIm looking for a consistent naming convention to distinguish between functions that return the value of a member variable, and functions that perform web service requests to retrieve the remote record which corresponds to that member variable.p  pre classlangphp prettyprintoverridecodeclass User     private address    public function getAddress        return thisgtaddress        public function pullAddress        address  ...  Perform web service request to retrieve address       return address      codepre  pNote that I changed the example code to reference a member variable called address. The original code referenced a member variable called id. ID is a loaded term and distracting, so I changed it to a more neutral example.p  pPerhaps some clarification on the nature of this web service client would help the discussion. This class is a client of a web service. I dont need to expose this class as a web service. When Im using this class, I just want a convenient naming convention to distinguish between a function that performs a web service request, and a function that retrieves the value that was stored inside of the object. p  pThe member would initially be populated via something like usetAddresspullAddress. Sometimes I just need to retrieve the current value stored in the object, which is when getAddress comes into play.p  pgetAddress seems intuitive, but let me know if my usage above is not correct. pullAddress seems a little clumsy. Perhaps requestAddress would be betterp  pStack Overflow will probably deem this question as not constructive, but any suggestions or examples would be appreciated.p

Negative 3885 pVery often, I draw graphs in R and export them in pdf or svg. Then I import them in Inkskape or Illustrator. Sometimes this generates weird results. For instance, when I generate a simple scatterplot with shapes 1 and 16, Inkscape in unable to read it and generate the following a hrefhttpsgist.githubusercontent.comblaquans6f9ea02430609536da5erawtest.svg relnofollowfilea. See my a hrefhttpsgist.github.comblaquans6f9ea02430609536da5efilesampler relnofollowgist filea.

Negative 3885 pWhat is the best way to call virtual functions in a derived class so that the compiler can inline or otherwise optimize the callp  pExamplep  precodeclass Base    virtual void foo  0   class Derived public Base    virtual void foo ...   void bar      foo     codepre  pI want the call to codefoocode in codebarcode to always call codeDerivedfoocode. It is my understanding that the call will result in a vtable lookup and the compiler cannot optimize it out since there may be another class inheriting from Derived.p  pI could explicitly call codeDerivedfoocode but that gets verbose if there are many virtual function calls in Derived. I also find it surprising that I could not find much material online addressing what seems to me to be a common case a final derived class calling virtual methods so I wonder if I am misusing virtual functions here or excessively optimizing. p  pHow should this be done Stop prematurely optimizing and stick with codefoocode, suck it up and use codeDerivedfoocode, or is there a better wayp

Negative 3885 pIm working on a Qt 5.3 desktop application C core with a QML ui whose main window is an codeApplicationWindowcode and that at some point launches codeDialogcodes. Since there are differences in the use of dialog modality between Windows and Mac OS X e. g. An about dialog is rarely modal on Mac OS X but is almost always modal on Windows and also in the way of presenting some dialogs content, Ive changed the design to allow the implementation of platform specific versions of the dialogs.p  pFor so I created the following strongDialogLoaderstrongp  precodeLoader      id dialogFactory     property string dialogName     function platformFolder          if Qt.platform.os  osx             return osx         return win          onDialogNameChanged  source  platformFolder    dialogName  .qml      onStatusChanged          if dialogFactory.status  Loader.Error             console.logDialogFactory failed to load file   source         else if dialogFactory.status  Loader.Ready             console.logDialogFactory file   source   loaded       codepre  pWhich I use as followsp  precodeApplicationWindow            property alias aboutDialog aboutDialogLoader.item           DialogLoader  id aboutDialogLoader dialogName AboutDialog            Action  text qsTrAbout... onTriggered aboutDialog.show         codepre  pThat approach is working fine and it suits my needs except for one thing Modal dialogs on Windows dont behave as they do when I declare them in the codeApplicationWindowcode directly. If the app looses focus when a modal windows is opened and the focus is granted again, the modal window appears behind the main window which causes the app to be inoperative.p  pAfter some research Ive realized that the cause of the problem is that with the loader approach the codeApplicationWindowcode is not acting as the transient parent of the codeDialogcode.p  pIve found a workaround for this by manually bringing the Dialog to front when that happensp  precodeMainWindow       ...     onActiveChanged          if Qt.platform.os  windows              if active                   ...                 if aboutDialog.visible                      aboutDialog.requestActivate                                   ...                                 ...  codepre  pbut I think it would be better to avoid such workarounds, if possible. After digging into the Qt documentation without any luck, I decided to post this question, which can be resumed as follows Is it possible to change the transient parent of a QML Window If so, please would you point out howp  pSuggestions about a different approach that could avoid the reparent stuff are welcome.p

Negative 3885 pI am trying to implement a profile page in my app which is similar to Instagram profile page img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comwnmMu.png altinstagram img srchttpi.imgur.comQreeW9g.png altwireframep  pBut the problem I have is the Cell from UICollectionView below get loaded by collectionViewcellForItemAtIndexPath But it load every cells at once ,it does not just load the visible cell as it should. And this is because it is inside scroll view ,the make every cell loads immediately. p  pThe image for cell will be sent from server via API and I want to do a loading when user scroll to 23 of page.  And this can be done easily in UICollectionViewController.But I want to know how to do that in ViewController that contain collectionView in lower path.p  pPlease help. I think using Header of CollectionView as an upper part of page might solve the problem.  But I also want to implement that when user tap the button and then the display below change  just like instagram page.  So I am not sure what direction should I go . Should it be a custom container VC or something else  p  pTIAp

Negative 3885 pIm sure we have all heard of apples iBeacon by now... Weve been working on a few projects using the technology and have been wondering about one usage that I have seen others promoting.. that is using the LE Bluetooth radios to create a dwell time heat map in a space...p  pThe concept sounds simple enough place a LE Beacon in an area and as people pass by it counts that person which is then overlaid over a store map to create traffic patterns.. thats the claim.  Im trying to figure out how that can be possible  p  pThe concept uses the mobile device on the passerby as the trigger for the count.  There is no way at all to achieve this with out the user having a certain app downloaded on their device correct  The only feasible way I can see it working is if the user has an app downloaded on their device and that app pings a web server every time it sees a beacon.. that is then mapped.. but that also will use data and battery resources on the mobile device which most likely will result in the user deleting the app before long...p  pThis also leaves a large number of passers by who will not be accounted for... making the results very difficult to quantify.p  pAm I wrong in this assumption  Is there something that Im missingp

But suppose I want to reverse the pack followed by rotating to the left by 3.

Another idea Im working on  define a helper function to extract the indices from rotatedindiceslt10,3type, turn that into a parameter pack and then apply makerotatedindiceslt10,3 on that parameter pack.p  pHere is the code I already have, in case anyone needs it for testing the structs themselves have already been tested thoroughlyp  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt include ltstringgt include lttuplegt  templateltstdsizet...gt struct packindices      using type  packindices   constexpr int positiveModuloint i, int n      return i  n  n  n   templateltstdsizet START, stdsizet END, stdsizet...

Negative 3885 pI have several large stdvectors of chars bytes loaded from binary files. p  pWhen my program runs out of memory, I need to be able to cull some of the memory used by these vectors. These vectors are almost the entirety of my memory usage, and theyre just caches for local and network files, so its safe to just grab the largest one and chop it in half or so.p  pOnly thing is, Im currently using vectorresize and vectorshrinktofit, but this seems to require more memory I imagine for a reallocation of the new size and then a bunch of time for destruction of the now destroyed pointers, which I thought would be free and then copying the remaining to the new vector. Note, this is on Windows platform, in debug, so the pointers might not be destroyed in the Release build or on other platforms.p  pIs there something I can do to just say C, please tell the OS that I no longer need the memory located past location N in this vector p  pAlternatively, is there another container Id be better off using I do need to have random access though, or put effort into designing a way to easily keep iterators pointing at the place Ill want to read next, which would be possible, just not easy, so Id prefer not using a stdlist.p

Negative 3885 pA little introduction on what Im doing ... For academic purposes I am creating an application in c using opencv for the detection of static objects in a scene. The application is based on a combined approach of background subtraction and tracking, and the detection of events related to the abandonment of the objects works fine. But at the moment I have a problem that I cant solve I have to implement a finite state machine for detect the event of object removal, both before and after the entry of the object in the background. To do this I was ordered by my superiors to use the edges of objects.p  pAnd now the problem. After detecting a vehicle illegally parked along a road, I need to compare the edges of various images the background captured at the time of the alarm, the current background, the current frame to understand what the vehicle do picks up the movement, remains parked or picks up the movement after being in the background. I run these comparisons on the region of the scene in which there is the vehicle vehicles typically have different size, I pull the edges using canny algorithm by obtaining a binarized CV8UC1 cvMat. At this point I have to compare them. I tried to detect the contours with findContours and compare them with matchShapes, but it does not seem the right way, Id compare each contour of the first image with every contour of the second, in addition typically the two images to campare have different number of contour for example original background and current background, because the edges of the current background increased with the entry of the vehicle in the background.p  pI also tried to create a new image in which each pixel corresponds to the absolute difference of the other two, then I counted the white pixels of the difference image wPx, and I used this number for comparison in this way I set two thresholds thr1 and thr2, and counted the pixels of the bounding rect of the vehicle perim, if wPxthr2perim images are different. I set percentages thresholds and I moltipy them with the perimeter of the bounding box to adapt the thresholds to the vehicle dimensions. This solution, however, seems to be very little robust.p  pDo you have something simple to suggest me Thank you very much in any case, more than once you StackOverflow users have helped mep  pPS a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comD68Mq.jpg relnofollowTHISa is an example of the images that I have to comparep  ul lipThe first is the background without the vehicle stationary, contains the edges of the streetpli lipthe second is the original background, the one captured when the stationary vehicle is detectedpli lipthe third is the current background which in this case is equal to the original being the same frame, but then changepli lipthe fourth is the current frame of the videopli ul

Negative 3885 pI believe Im way off base here but Im not sure the best approach to take. I have a products table and a reservation table. I need to evaluate on the fly the availability of products based on their reservations for a certain time frame. There could be multiple reservations for each product but my results should just be the product table with a computed column for its availability.

Negative 3885 pI am working with a UIScrollView and am unable to autoshift the content when I change the views contentInset property.

Negative 3885 pI have some code for calculating missing values in an image, based on neighbouring values in a 2D circular window. It also uses the values from one or more temporallyadjacent images at the same locations i.e. the same 2D window shifted in the 3rd dimension. p  pFor each position that is missing, I need to calculate the value based not necessarily on all the values available in the whole window, but only on the spatiallynearest n cells that do have values in both images  Zaxis positions, where n is some value less than the total number of cells in the 2D window. p  pAt the minute, its much quicker to calculate for everything in the window, because my means  of sorting to get the nearest n cells with data is the slowest part of the function as it has to be repeated each time even though the distances in terms of window coordinates do not change. Im not sure this is necessary and feel I must be able to get the sorted distances once, and then mask those in the process of only selecting available cells.p  pHeres my code for selecting the data to use within a window of the gap cell locationp  precode radius will in reality be 100 radius  2 y,x  np.ogrid[radiusradius1, radiusradius1] dist  np.sqrtx2  y2 circletemplate  dist gt radius   this will in reality be a very large 3 dimensional array  representing daily images with some gaps, indicated by 0s dataStack  np.zeros2,5,5 dataStack[1]  np.random.random25  100.reshapedist.shape dataStack[0]  np.random.random25  100.reshapedist.shape  testdata  dataStack[1] alternatedata  dataStack[0] randomgaplocations  np.random.random25  30.reshapedist.shape gt testdata testdata[randomgaplocations]  0 testdata[radius, radius]  0   in reality we will go through every gap zero location in the data   for each image and for each gap use slicing to get a window of   size radius21, radius21 around it from each image, with the   gap being at the centre i.e.   testgaplocation  [radius, radius]  and the variables testdata, alternatedata below will refer to these   slices  locationstoexclude  np.logicalorcircletemplate, np.logicalor                                      testdata0, alternatedata0  the places that are inside the circular mask and where both images   have data  locationstoinclude  locationstoexclude numberavailable  np.countnonzerolocationstoinclude   we only want to do the interpolation calculations from the nearest n   locations that have data available, n will be 100 in reality numberrequired  3  availabledistances  dist[locationstoinclude] availabledata  testdata[locationstoinclude] availablealternates  alternatedata[locationstoinclude]  if numberavailable gt numberrequired      In this case we need to find the closest numberrequired of elements, based      on distances recorded in dist, from availabledata and availablealternates      Having to repeat this argsort for each gap cell calculation is slow and feels       like it should be avoidable     sortedDistanceIndices  availabledistances.argsortkind  mergesort,axisNone     requiredIndices  sortedDistanceIndices[0numberrequired]     selecteddata  np.takeavailabledata, requiredIndices     selectedalternates  np.takeavailablealternates , requiredIndices else      we just use availabledata and availablealternates as they are...   now do stuff with the selected data to calculate a value for the gap cell codepre  pThis works, but over half of the total time of the function is taken in the argsort of the masked spatial distance data. 900uS of a total 1.4mS  and this function will be running tens of billions of times, so this is an important difference p  pI am sure that I must be able to just do this argsort once outside of the function, when the spatial distance window is originally set up, and then include those sort indices in the masking, to get the first howManyToCalculate indices without having to redo the sort. The answer might involve putting the various bits that we are extracting from, into a record array  but I cant figure out how, if so.

Negative 3885 pQuestion  Given an action TL1,L2L1L2UL2L1, where L1,L2 are languages, decide if P, NP, NPintersectioncoNP are closed under the action i.e. given L1 in emclassem, L2 in emclassem, TL1,L2 is in emclassem also.p  pMy answers  P is pretty easy given M1 and M2 deterministic deciders for L1, L2 we build Rx that accepts iff M1x accepted and M2x rejected OR M1x rejected and M2x accepted. R is deterministic, polytime TM, thus TL1,L2 is in P.p  pNP here comes my question. From the first look, the same exact TM R from previous question decides TL1,L2. And it is polytime nondeterministic TM, thus TL1,L2 is in NP. On the other hand, TL1,L2L1 U L2emintersectem[L1intersectL2]complement. In other words, it is a XOR of L1,L2. Since NP is closed under union and intersection, L1 U L2 is in NP, L1intersectL2 is also in NP, but its complement is not necessarily in NP. Thus, L1 U L2emintersectem[L1intersectL2]complement is not necessarily in NP, meaning NP is not closed under TL1,L2.p  pCould you please point me at the mistakep
Negative 3885 pIn slick we can use p  precodequery.filter m gt m.state  state1 ampamp m.status  status1  m.state  state2 ampamp m.status  status2  codepre  pfor an OR condition in where clause. However my requirement is I have OR conditions in a list passed by user as part of URL. Conditions list includes tuples of state and status like p  precodeList[state1, status1,state2, status2,state3, status3] codepre  pSo what I wanted was to either be able to build the  statement inside of filter so that I can use each of the conditions from the list to generate the query but I am not sure how to achieve that. Or if there is something like      p  precodequery.applyOrFilters.orFiltercondition1.orFiltercondition2  codepre  pwhich will actually do condition1 OR condition2 on query object. Is it possible with Slick or with for comprehensions as of now p
Negative 3885 pPremise Im building a cropping tool that handles twofinger arbitrary rotation of an image as well as arbitrary cropping.p  pSometimes the image ends up rotated in a way that empty space is inserted to fill a gap between the rotated image and the crop rect see the examples below.p  pI need to ensure that the image view, when rotated, fits entirely into the cropping rectangle. If it doesnt, I then need to retransform the image zoom it so that it fits into the crop bounds.p  pUsing a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions15710853objectiveccheckifsubviewsofrotateduiviewsintersectthis answera, Ive implemented the ability to check whether a rotated UIImageView intersects with the cropping CGRect, but unfortunately that doesnt tell me if the crop rect is strongentirelystrong contained in the rotated imageview.

Negative 3885 pI started looking into create threads in Python. I did some theory search first to understand how Threads work in Python. I also went ahead to read about the use of Queue in Python and how it can help solving trivial Threading problems. I was able to understand separate codes for each. Then I came across the following tutorial  p  pa hrefhttpwww.ibm.comdeveloperworksaixlibraryauthreadingpython relnofollowhttpwww.ibm.comdeveloperworksaixlibraryauthreadingpythonap  pIt shows the relevance of Thread and Queue in Python and how it can speed up the execution process under certain circumstances. p  pI am having difficulty in understanding some areas of the code  p  precodedef main          spawn a pool of threads, and pass them queue instance          for i in range5           t  ThreadUrlqueue           t.setDaemonTrue           t.start         populate queue with data              for host in hosts             queue.puthost         wait on the queue until everything has been processed             queue.join        main       print Elapsed Time s  time.time  start codepre  pIn the first for loop the multiple threads are created and a queue instance is passed to it.

Negative 3885 pI am having trouble with the Zordering in OpenGL only 2D.br I wrote a class which renders a list of sprite objects to the screen. The sprite objects have a distance property, which tells how far away from the camera they are.br As I read that binding a texture in openGL is slow, I tried to reduce the binding of textures to a minimum.br This is done by Having a map of . So all sprite objects which use the same texture are saved in a list. When it comes to rendering, first the texture is binded and then all the objects with this texture are rendered. Then it binds the next texture and renders all objects for this etc.br Now the problem was Although I use vertex3F to render the objects, they are not sorted correctly.

Negative 3885 pFolks, I have yet to see a build method to war up a javascript project.p  pCurrently the defacto method is to just shove it out to the docroot of your appserver which I find atrocious.p  pGiven that my hello world node.js javascript project has at least 27,000 modules beneath the project root dir has made any attempt to operate the root dir impossible even inside eclipse due to the parsing and processing and preprocessing that managing and handling the project has to go thru.p  pI also find atrocious that GOOGLE is the goto corp which humanity has bought into and sold out for for all corps just because they are politically designed for totalitarianism and they got no chance of operating neuro or nano processing integrated to any internet unless they got super high speed abilities to process. Personally they need to change their platform to something faster than speed of light.p  pAnd the coding is outrageous..stuffing every concept into a dom node. Corporations are in for a big bottleneck surprise.p  pRegardless, I cannot create a maven project to traverse and bundle up my javascript node.js helloworld project due to the incompetent slowness of even attempting to manage this amount of dependencies required to operate such a project.p  pIs there a maven script available to leapfrog me to a packaged up ward up helloworld project that I can copy to tomcat docroot p  pHow do I build a node.js project for production packaging and deployment.p

Negative 3885 pIm making a Unity game on iOS. Im aware of the AOT limitations. When I added a Dictionary which happened to have a struct Key type, I got a flurry of ExecutionEngineExceptions.

Negative 3885 pExcuse my noobidity, but I do not really understand the followingp  precodeFunction instanceof Object codepre  pIt returns codetruecode. OK. I understand that... so codeFunctioncode is in fact an object. Rather it is the constructor for any function. So when you create a function you create an object which has a codeprototypecode that is itself an object and that codeprototypecode holds the constructor of the function.

Negative 3885 h1Using several modules with independent Hibernate Instancesh1  pI am creating a multimodule maven project with modules ModuleA and ModuleB below the parent.p  h1Hibernate throws a MappingExceptionh1  pThe modules use their own Hibernate mapping with a own resource folder.  Each module persists its objects independently from the other modules. Now when I try to instantiate a Class from Module B within Module A, I can access all the required Methods, but when I execute the Application, Hibernate throws this error p  precodeException in thread main org.hibernate.MappingException Unknown entity org.example.ModuleB.Person     at org.hibernate.internal.SessionFactoryImpl.getEntityPersisterSessionFactoryImpl.java1096     at org.hibernate.internal.SessionImpl.getEntityPersisterSessionImpl.java1443     at org.hibernate.event.internal.AbstractSaveEventListener.saveWithGeneratedIdAbstractSaveEventListener.java116     at org.hibernate.event.internal.DefaultSaveOrUpdateEventListener.saveWithGeneratedOrRequestedIdDefaultSaveOrUpdateEventListener.java209     at org.hibernate.event.internal.DefaultSaveEventListener.saveWithGeneratedOrRequestedIdDefaultSaveEventListener.java55     at org.hibernate.event.internal.DefaultSaveOrUpdateEventListener.entityIsTransientDefaultSaveOrUpdateEventListener.java194     at org.hibernate.event.internal.DefaultSaveEventListener.performSaveOrUpdateDefaultSaveEventListener.java49     at org.hibernate.event.internal.DefaultSaveOrUpdateEventListener.onSaveOrUpdateDefaultSaveOrUpdateEventListener.java90     at org.hibernate.internal.SessionImpl.fireSaveSessionImpl.java715     at org.hibernate.internal.SessionImpl.saveSessionImpl.java707     at org.hibernate.internal.SessionImpl.saveSessionImpl.java702 codepre  pI can add the mapping for the class from ModuleB additionally into the Hibernate config file of Module A. Then it works. But this is not how it should work as each module should be independent. It could be theoretically be stored within a completely different RDBMS. p  h1More backgroundh1  pOriginally I only used only one module, it split it and want to have it more distangled. I executed mvn clean and compiled everything from scratch.p  pAdditionally the pom.xml from Modue A has a dependency on Module B. p  precode    ltdependencygt         ltgroupIdgtorg.exampleltgroupIdgt         ltartifactIdgtModuleBltartifactIdgt         ltversiongt1.0SNAPSHOTltversiongt     ltdependencygt codepre  h1Solutionh1  pAs proposed by Skizzo, I just renamed the configuration files for each module. Originally, each module contained a Hibernate configuration file called codehibernate.cfg.xmlcode. I renamed these config files in both modules. The config file of ModuleA is now called codehibernate.moduleA.cfg.xmlcode and the config file of ModuleB is now called codehibernate.moduleB.cfg.xmlcodep  pEach module also contained a HibernateUtil.java class used for initializing the Session Factory. I also renamed the HibernateUtil classes for each module. ModuleAs Util class is now called codeHibernateUtilModuleAcode whereas the Util class of ModuleB is called codeHibernateUtilModuleBcode. Now there is no confusion between the two configurations possible ans Hibernate now knows which configuration to pick for each module. p  pThen I adapted the two HibernateUtil classes to load the individual config file like this p  pHibernateUtilModuleAp  precodeconfiguration.configurehibernate.moduleA.cfg.xml codepre  pHibernateUtilModuleBp  precodeconfiguration.configurehibernate.moduleB.cfg.xml codepre  pThe HibernateUtil class for ModuleA now looks roughly like thisp  precode    Hibernate session management   public class HibernateUtilModuleA      private static SessionFactory sessionFactory     private static ServiceRegistry serviceRegistry      static      try           Configuration configuration  new Configuration          configuration.configurehibernate.ModuleA.cfg.xml          serviceRegistry  new StandardServiceRegistryBuilder.applySettingsconfiguration.getProperties.build         sessionFactory  configuration.buildSessionFactoryserviceRegistry        catch HibernateException he          System.err.printlnError creating Session   he         throw new ExceptionInInitializerErrorhe                 public static SessionFactory getSessionFactory      return sessionFactory       codepre

Negative 3885 pI wrote this Python code to do a particular computation in a bigger project and it works fine for smaller values of codeNcode but it doesnt scale up very well for large values and even though I ran it for a number of hours to collect the data, I was wondering if there was a way to speed this upp  precodeimport numpy as np  def FillArrayarr while0 in arr     ind1  np.random.randint0,N     ifarr[ind1]0         ifind10             arr[ind1]  1             arr[ind11]  2         elifind1lenarr1             arr[ind1]  1             arr[ind11]  2         else             arr[ind1]  1             arr[ind11]  2             arr[ind11]  2     else         continue return arr  N50000  dist  [] for i in range1000     arr  [0 for x in rangeN]     dist.appendFillarrarr.count2 codepre  pFor codeN  50,000code, it currently takes slightly over a minute on my computer for one iteration to fill the array. So if I want to simulate this, lets say, a 1000 times, it takes many hours. Is there something I can do to speed this up p  pEdit 1 I forgot to mention what it actually does. I have a list of length codeNcode and I initialize it by having zeros in each entry. Then I pick a random number between code0code and codeNcode and if that index of the list has a zero, I replace it by code1code and its neighboring indices by code2code to indicate they are not filled by code1code but they cant be filled again. I keep doing this till I populate the whole list by code1code and code2code and then I count how many of the entries contain code2code which is the result of this computation. Thus I want to find out if I fill an array randomly with this constraint, how many entries will not be filled.p  pObviously I do not claim that this is the most efficient way find this number so I am hoping that perhaps there is a better alternative way if this code cant be speeded up.p

Negative 3885 pI am working in a page which contains two diffirent plugins which conflict with eachother  on html. One plugin arange divs absolute. The other plugin makes a custom made dropdown list. The problem is.. that if i put the select box, in one aranged div. and there is another aranged div under it. The selectbox inside the top div will go behind the bottom div.. I want this div to go on top over the other block instead. I dont want to rearange all z indexes from bottom to top in opposite order. p  pI have been searching for a css solution to this problem. because the system is heavily depending on both plugins  implemented on every page. So i cant just take away one of those 2 plugins..

I am raising a new question here because I am trying a different approach to the problem. I have gone through simlar questions p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4776456javacustomclassloadersomeclassesarenotloadedbymyclassloaderrq1java custom classloader some classes are not loaded by my classloaderap  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10197080howtosetmyclassloaderasthejvmsclassloaderforloadingallclassesjarrq1How to set my ClassLoader as the JVM39s ClassLoader for loading ALL classes jar classes includedap  pbut no luck. so here is the problem. p  pI am trying to intercept loading of all classes including standard JDK classes in my custom class loader. The idea is to load an extended class whenever there is a request for DatagramSocket class. I dont have a handle to when and how DatagramSocket would be instantiated in the application and hence I thought this is the best way to intercept loading of this particular class before I start the app from my main method. For this purpose I wrote TestClassLoader,p  precodepublic class MyClassLoader extends ClassLoader       public MyClassLoaderClassLoader parent              superparent           public Class loadClassString name throws ClassNotFoundException              System.out.printlnloading   name         if name.equalsjava.net.DatagramSocket                  name.equalsMyDatagramSocket                      System.out.printlnLoading DatagramSocket class....   name             return super.loadClassMyDatagramSocket                  else                      return super.loadClassname                codepre  pand a test program,p  precodepublic class TestClassLoader      public static void mainString[] args throws Exception           See if this invokes myClassLoader         DatagramSocket dSocketnew DatagramSocket         System.out.printlnDatagramSocket.classloader  DatagramSocket.class.getClassLoader         check the Class loader for the main class         System.out.printlnTestClassLoader.classloader    TestClassLoader.class.getClassLoader         codepre  pand invoked the test program using Djava.system.class.loaderMyClassLoader option.

Am I doing this right p
Negative 3885 pI have a database design like this. I am using MYSQL. Have a vehicle table to store information about a vehiclep  precodeCREATE TABLE test.vehicle  vehicleid BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL, fueltypeidref TINYINT UNSIGNED NULL DEFAULT NULL, drivetypeidref TINYINT UNSIGNED NULL DEFAULT NULL, conditionidref TINYINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL, transmissiontypeidref TINYINT UNSIGNED NULL DEFAULT NULL, PRIMARY KEY vehicleid  ENGINE  INNODB CHARSET  latin1 COLLATE  latin1swedishci  codepre  pI used separate tables to store records for each reference id. for eg I have a fuel type table to store fuels, transmission type table and so on.p  pBut now I figured that the schema of those tables are pretty much equivalent.  So created a table like this.p  precodeCREATE TABLE test.vehiclefeature    vehfeatureid TINYINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTOINCREMENT,   featuretypeidref TINYINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,   name VARCHAR 50 NOT NULL,   isactive TINYINT 1 NOT NULL DEFAULT TRUE,   PRIMARY KEY vehfeatureid  ENGINE  INNODB CHARSET  latin1 COLLATE  latin1swedishci  codepre  pand I put all those fuels and transmisiion types into this table with a feature type Id to identify the group. Now I have to join same table again and again to retrieve the values from my vehicle table.p  pSo my question is. p  pShall I maintain my separate tables or Shall I go with this new approach Since I have to write same joins again and again there is no reduce in my code. I can easily join my small tables rather than this one table. Also if I use small tables I can go for inner join to join those tables but in here I have to use left joins to join the tables.Also separate tables have less records comparing to one table. All what this approach doing is reduce the tables of my DB only  4 tables which I dont care . Sum of all records in these 4 tables will be 100 records.p  pSo what is performance wise goodp

Negative 3885 pI have the following problemp  pWe have a lot of different, yet similar types of data items that we want to record in a MariaDB database. All data items have some common parameters such as id, username, status, file glob, type, comments, start amp end time stamps. In addition there are many lets say between 40 and 100 parameters that are specific to each type of data item.p  pWe would prefer to have the different data item types in the same table because they will be displayed along with several other data, as they happen, in one single list in the web application. This will appear like an activity stream or Facebook wall. p  pIt seems that the normalised approach with a toplevel generic table joined with specific tables underneath will lead to bad performance. We will have to do both a lot of joins and unions in order to display the activity stream, and the application will frequently poll with this query, so its important that the query runs fast. p  pSo, which is the better solutions in terms of performance and storage optimizationp  ol lito utilize MariaDBs dynamic columnsli lito just add in all the different kinds of columns we need in one table, and just accept that each data item type will only use a few of the columns, i.e. the rest will be null.li lisomething elseli ol  pDoes it matter if we use regular columns when a lot of the data in them will be nullp  pWhen should we use dynamic columns and when is it better to use regular columns p

Negative 3885 pI have a codeCompanycode entity that I fetch with a JPQL query with Hibernate. The entity has a manytomany association with a codeKeywordcode entity. Since the join table has an additional column codeisactivecode, this table has been mapped to a codeCompanyKeywordcode entity. So the association is like thisp  blockquote   pCompany lt CompanyKeyword  Keywordp blockquote  pNow, the association from the codeCompanycode entity is lazy, and it is emnotem initialized by my JPQL query, as I want to avoid creating a cartesian product performance problem. That is why I want to initialize the association emafterem running the JPQL query, e.g. like thisp  precodeService class CompanyServiceImpl implements CompanyService      Autowired     private CompanyRepository companyRepository      Transactional     public Company findOneint companyId          Company company  this.companyRepository.findOneWithSomeCustomQuerycompanyId         Hibernate.initializecompany.companyKeywords         return company       codepre  pFor a normal manytomany association, this would work great, as all of the associated entities would be fetched in a single query. However, since I have an entity between codeCompanycode and codeKeywordcode, Hibernate will only initialize the emfirst part of the associationem, i.e. from codeCompanycode to codeCompanyKeywordcode, and not from codeCompanyKeywordcode to codeKeywordcode. I hope that makes sense. I am looking for a way to initialize this association all the way without having to do something like thisp  precodeCompany company  this.companyRepository.findOneWithSomeCustomQuerycompanyId Hibernate.initializecompany.getCompanyKeywords  for CompanyKeyword ck  company.getCompanyKeywords      Hibernate.initializeck.getKeyword  codepre  pThe above code is neither clean, nor good in terms of performance. If possible, I would like to stick to my current approach of using a JPQL query to fetch my codeCompanycode entity and then initializing certain associations afterwards it would take quite a bit of refactoring to change this in my project. Should I just manually fetch the association with a second JPQL query, or is there a better way of doing it that I havent thought ofp  pBelow are my mappings.

Negative 3885 pIm writing some software that has to speak to an older piece of industrial machinery via RS232. Im using the SerialPort gem in conjunction with a USBSerial converter StarTech ICUSB2321FIS w FTDI chipset to talk to the machine.p  pIm running Ruby 1.9.3p547 on OSX v10.9.5p  pIm writing USASCII data to the serial port, but the last part of the data is always cut off. It seems that the data is being buffered either by Ruby or by the OS, and when the write call returns there is still data in the buffer. When the program exits the data in this buffer is abandoned rather than sent.p  pUnfortunately the issue doesnt seem to be reproducible when using a virtual COM port, only with actual hardware. I assume this is because the virtual COM port does not accurately reproduce the transmission speed limitation of actual hardware. For testing Im using a second serialusb converter with a null modem and gender changer between the two. The behaviour this setup exhibits is identical to how the real machinery behaves.p  pHeres the smallest code example that will reproduce the issuep  precoderequire serialport  mockdata  100.times.toa.joinrn.encodeUSASCII  serialport  SerialPort.newdevcu.usbserialA100etCX, 9600, 7, 1, SerialPortEVEN  serialport.writemockdata  seialport.close codepre  pThe output from this would be a list of numbers up until about 80, the remaining 20 lines are never sent because the port is closed. This seems to be related to the number of characters buffered as opposed to number of lines.p  pI would expect codewritecode to block until the write is finalized, however it only seems to block until everything is written to a buffer in either ruby or the OS.p  pI have tried using various method to ensure the data gets flushed all the way to the OS before the script exits, such asp  precodeserialport.fsync serialport.sync  true serialport.flush serialport.ioflush serialport.syswritemockdata codepre  pThe only thing Ive found so far that works is to add a codesleepcode after the last write. However this is unreliable because the size of the buffered data determines how long youd have to sleep for.p  pIdeally Id like to be able to find out how much unwritten data remains in the buffer and pause or loop until the output buffer is empty. As yet I havent been able to find out how to do this so any help is appreciated.p  pThanks,br Aaronp

Negative 3885 pPrepending that a solution only needs to work in the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, and Safari as a bonus.p  pp  pI am trying to use an associative array for a large data set with knockout.  My first try made it a true associative arrayp  precode[1 Object, 3 Object,...,nObject] codepre  pbut knockout was not happy with looping over that.  So I tried a cheating way, hoping thatp  precode[undefined, Object, undefined, Object,...,Object] codepre  pwhere the location in the array is the PK ID from the database table.  This array is about 3.2k items large, and would be iterated over around every 10 seconds, hence the need for speed.  I tried doing this with a splice, e.g.p  precode.eachdata, function index, item      self.myArray.spliceitem.PKID, 0, new Objectitem  codepre  pbut splice does not create indices, so since my first PKID is 1, it is still inserted at codemyArray[0]code regardless.  If my first PK was 500, it would start at 0 still.p  pMy second thought is to initialize the array with codevar myArray  new ArraymaxSizecode but that seems heavy handed.  I would love to be able to use some sort of map function to do this, but Im not really sure how to make the key value translate into an index value in javascript.p  pMy third thought was to keep two arrays, one for easy look up and the other to store the actual values.  So it combines the first two solutions, almost, by finding the index of the object in the first example and doing a lookup with that in the second example.  This emseemsem to be how many people manage associative arrays in knockout, but with the array size and the fact that its a live updating app with a growing data set seems memory intensive and not easily manageable when new information is added.p  pAlso, maybe Im hitting the mark wrong here  Were putting these into the DOM via knockout and managing with a library called isotope, and as I mentioned it updates about every 10 seconds.

Negative 3885 pWhen developing TDD your objects grow as code evolves . First they include only some funcionalities, and later you add new ones. You can basically do it with composition andor inheritance.p  pAt the same time, you almost allways use interfaces for test, and for production code to ensure low coupling, dependency inversion, dependency injection and mocking.p  pHow do you MANAGE thisp  pI mean, for example you have created a class, and now it must include a new attribute for example, a Person now can have an email. What to dop  ul liemModify the class, adding the new attributeem Then you must ADD new constructors. But if you modify existing constructors then you must refactor all TEST involved, not only production code. You could try to keep all constructors as you add new attributes, but at the end mostly become unusefull, obsolete only exist becouse of TESTS, with a complex logic of constructor calling another constructors or use some kind of factory li liemDerive the classem This is more compilant to OCP. But if you make a real TDD, with small steps, if you always derive, starting from a very simple class, you would end with a terribly complex and somehow unneccesary inheritance. And besides, its supposed you allways must test only PUBLIC exposed members. So, again, as base classes become protected, must refactor tests to access the public ones.li liemComposeem Copmposing has no problem with constructors, but is not allways a good solution. As for our current example.li ul  pAnd a similar thing happens, in some way, with interfaces.p  pSo, as code grows, constructors an interfaces must evolve. And I have three precepts in mindp  ul liYou should avoid refactor tests.li liThe producion code must not keep code only intended for testing i.e. constructorsli liISP states to use specific interfaces. As code grows many of them become unnecesary, as they are only used for testing i.e. mocking classes that, in many cases, should be protected or private.li ul  pSo, as I said... how can i manage all this while developing TDD I know its a question for a long answer, so, if you could refer to some good article, or resourcep  pThanks for your patience, as always.p

After initial deployment the app worked perfectly, information was persisted in the database, routing was working, all the tests were passing  everything was good.p  pThen I deployed some new changes with codegit push openshift mastercode. When I went back to the app it was still running, but all the database content including table structure was gone. p  pThe output from the codepushcode was clean. I didnt write any hooks, or have any funky cron jobs running. I could repeat the process, rebuilding the database, and watch it get blown away on every deployment. This problem was not occurring in my local instance.p
Negative 3885 pI have a problem with Tooltips in JavaFX. For illustration the core of this problem I created new JavaFX project through IntelliJ Idea.

Negative 3885 pIm working on performance tuning some aggregateheavy queries, and Im wondering whether repeating the same aggregate function over and over has a significant performance penalty.p  pIm assuming MS SQL Server is intelligent enough to calculate each repeated aggregate only once, and then reuse the resultant value each time that exact aggregate is encountered within the same query  Is my assumption correct herep  pThe alternative to this is, we can add a bunch more joins to this view joining the same tables over and over again, with varying codejoin oncode clauses, to group rows together in a bunch of different ways to produce the various totals without reusing any aggregate functions more than once  but looking at the execution plans we can see that adding more joins definitely emdoesem make the query take longer, and we technically already have all the information we need with the current number of joins anyway we just have to perform the addition to produce the compound totals.p  pHeres some example code, from one of the views in questionp  precodeCOUNTBIG  [UVCE].

Negative 3885 pIve done a few simple apps, but still new to Android development. Ive been trying to make fragments work but my app just seems to crash every time I try to load a fragment. Im trying to make a game. The way I had structured it was that every menu screen would be a fragmentmain menu, options, ingame. I went on and made my research about how to program a fragment. Found a few good articles and videos. Pretty much they all do kinda the same thing, but for them it seems to work. It really didnt work for me. They way I wanted this to work was, load one activity and on that activity change or replace fragments according to the menu.p  pOn crash, logcat, sometimes displays the error and sometimes it doesnt. p  pLet me know if you need the XML filehighly doubt it.

Negative 3885 pI have a java application, which can send and receive messages tofrom queues, and Im trying to set it up to use codeMQ AMScode on codeLinuxcode.p  pIt is first time Im setting codeMQ AMScode up at all, so Im trying the examples provided in the codeMQ distributioncode codeJmsProviderJmsConsumercode.p  pInitially, I tried codeWebSphere MQ 7.5code, which comes with codejava 6code prepacked, and I could set it up, created a queue, used the attached samples to send and receive encoded messages.p  pHowever, my application is not compatible with codejava 6code. p  pI downloaded codeibm jdk 8code, and tried to set that up. p  pIt works if the messages are not encoded however if security policy is enabled, I can send messages to the queue using WebSpheres own codeJmsProducercode, but cant get messages using their own codeJmsConsumercode  getting a generic codeMQRCNOTAUTHORISEDcode error same as the one below, except for java version. Ive turned off codechannel authorisationcode, and made sure the user Im using to create messages is specified as codeMCAUSERcode on the queue manager. My user is not in the codemqm groupcode, however, because the group doesnt exist and my Linux distribution doesnt react to codeaddgroupcode with anything other than codeunknown commandcode.p  pI then thought that may be the codejava 8code distribution I have is missing something vital to codeMQcode, so I downloaded codeWebSphere MQ 8code, which contains codejava 7code, and tried running codeJmsProducerJmsConsumercode again using this new codejava 7code, against my old codeMQ 7.5code queue. The results are the same  the producer successfully produces and places the message on the queue, but the consumer falls over with codenot authorisedcode. p  precode[userNamemachineName ] optmqmjavajre64jrebinjava showversion classpath CLASSPATH JmsConsumer m QMTESTAMS d TEST.Q h hostName p 1616 l CHANNEL gt JmsConsumer.output java version 1.7.0 JavaTM SE Runtime Environment build pxa647027sr22014102601SR2 IBM J9 VM build 2.7, JRE 1.7.0 Linux amd6464 Compressed References 20141017217728 JIT enabled, AOT enabled J9VM  R27Java727SR2201410171632B217728 JIT   tr.r13.java2014100374587.01 GC    R27Java727SR2201410171632B217728CMPRSS J9CL  20141017217728 JCL  2014100401 based on Oracle 7u71b13  com.ibm.msg.client.jms.DetailedJMSSecurityException JMSWMQ2008 Failed to open MQ queue TEST.Q.

Negative 3885 pSo, quick explanation of the problemp  pWhen Im changing the name of my code.resxcode file from codeFoo1code to codeFoo2code OR change the namespace which the form is in from codeFooSpace1code to codeFooSpace2code, Ill get a p  precodeSystem.Resources.MissingManifestResourceException occurred in mscorlib.dll error at runtime at the line  thisgtBackgroundImage  clisafecastltSystemDrawingImagegtresourcesgtGetObjectLthis.BackgroundImage codepre  pwhich seems to be related top  precodeSystemComponentModelComponentResourceManager  resources  gcnew SystemComponentModelComponentResourceManagerFoo2typeid codepre  pI literally tried every suggestion google yielded regarding this issue, but nothing seems to have applied. The Form is the first class defined in the file and the fix of changing the Resource File Name property to match the new namespacename, doesnt apply as that property got removed after VS 2005 . This happens with every resource in the code.resxcode file, by the way.p  pThe full description of the exception isp  precodeAn unhandled exception of type System.Resources.MissingManifestResourceException occurred in mscorlib.dll  Additional information Could not find any resources appropriate for the specified culture or the neutral culture in the given assembly. Make sure ltFooSpace1gt.ltFoo2gt.resources was correctly embedded or linked into assembly ltProjectNamegt. codepre  pWhen renaming codeFoo2code back to codeFoo1code or codeFooSpace2code back to codeFooSpace1code and change the name of the resource file back too, it all works, by the way. I just cant seem to figure out why this is, thankful for any helpp

Ive implemented a help class as suggested for JsonObjectRequest, as, as I understood, you cant override the getparams method when defining a request locally. the executeJson method is the interesting one I get the user access token from my SharedPreferences Where its correctly stored, put that in a String Map and give that to the CustomRequest, where, inside the help class, it gets thrown into a getparams method that simply returns the params. The responselistener sadly never gets called, as the errorlistener reports the following p  precodecom.android.volley.NoConnectionError java.io.IOException No authentication challenges found codepre  pAccording to the API reference of Misfit, that should work. Now, I know that a GET request requires headers and not params but does that make any differencep

Negative 3885 pWithin our company weve got a rather large serviceapplication running as a azure cloudservice. The service contains a webrole and a workerrole. The webrole contains an MVCapplication and the workerrole is running in the background. The workerrole is used to handle several large processes and a bunch smaller processes 247, this is checked every 5 minutes.p  pIve created an azure website for this application and wrote a small wrapper class which checks if configuration values needs to be taken from either the web.config file or cloud configuration files .cscfg files. Ive added the appropiate transformations to transform some extra settings and published the application to the azure website.p  pSo far everything works good, but what ive expected a bit already indeed happened.. The workerrole isnt working anymore and is throwing errors.

Since its a heavy process were running quite expensive machines in azure, but that mostly only needed for the workerrole. The webpart is lightweight. So its mainly an idea trying to reduce costs. So the idea is to convert the webrole to an azure website this part is working already with just a small modification to read information from the web.config instead of the cloudconfiguration. But the workerrole currently isnt working because we havent changed anything for that yet. An colleague of mine basically said write a wrapper for the configpart, publish the azurewebsite to 1 or more testenvironments and point them to the same workerrole. But im having my doubts wether this is even possible..p  pDid anyone else ever ran into this sort of situation and found a solution for this Any help finding a solution is greatly appreciatedp

Negative 3885 pSo I am following this book, machine learning hands on for developers written by Jason Bell. I got very far in this book until I had to connect my springxd streams to hadoop.  I am running springxd 1.2.1, and I am running hadoop 1.2.1, and 2.6.0, I have tried both which is on port 9000.  In this tutorial we are supposed to take a twitter stream and pipe it to a file in hadoop, but when I created and deployed this stream the file it created was not getting populated with tweets. So now, to make things simplier I am now just trying to get the stream connected to hdfs by creating this stream,p  pstream create name ticktock definition time  hdfs deployp  pwhich should be piping the date to a file in xdticktockticktock0.txt.tmp, however, when I try to use the command p  phadoop fs cat xdticktockticktock0.txt.tmp p  pit produces nothing leaving me to assume that there is no data reaching it.  I did place a tap on this stream, and ran it to a local file.  In that file it was recording the times correctly, so I know that my stream is doing the correct function and producing an output, its just not reaching hadoop for some reason.  p  pIt will create the file in hadoop, so its not like hadoop is completely ignoring the stream, theres just nothing inside the file that it creates for it.  p  pI did find someone who was having the same problem as me and they their vm networking to NET or something, but I am not using a vmbox.p  pI have tried chmoding the folder xd to 777,  I have made sure that I can ssh to my local machine without a password, I have made sure that there is a data node running in my hadoop cluster, and I have made sure that the function cat works by placing a file that I created into my hdfs then running the cat command on it from both within springxd shell and from a regular terminal.  p  pI unfortunately am at a loss, could someone help me out in this scenariop  pIf you need any information about my hadoop cluster or springxd setup let me know what, I am still a newby with these technologies.p

Negative 3885 pBelow is my implementation of a hash table using buckets for collision detection. Im trying to make sure I can fully understand the logic behind hash tables and visualize it. This is what a hash table looks like in my casep  p[[[]lttuple]ltbucket, []ltbucket]ltstoragep  pThe key value pairs in the tuples are placed in the bucket based upon the hashing functions output, emi.e.em, the bucket index. Once you are at the hashed bucket index, you place the key value pair there, inside the bucket. if anything matches that exact key once inside the bucket it gets overwritten in my implementation. The collision detection takes place when you find the same key as before, you overwrite its value.p  pCould I have done something differentmdashperhaps added the key with a different value to the end of the tuple instead of overwriting the value or must the keys always be unique Is there ever a case when only the values need to be uniquep  precode    var makeHashTable  function          var max  4        return          storage [],     retrieve functionkey        when we retrieve, we want to access the bucket in the same way as insert, but we dont need to set it to storage since that is already taken       care of in the insert function.  if theres nothing in the bucket, the loop wont run.       this function will return null by default.       var bucketIndex  hashFnkey, max       var bucket  this.storage[bucketIndex]        for var i  0 i lt bucket.length i          var tuple  bucket[i]         if tuple[0]  key            return tuple[1]                       return null     ,      insert functionkey, value        hash function gives you the right index       var bucketIndex  hashFnkey, max         where you need to put the bucket. if theres no bucket, initialize it.       var bucket  this.storage[bucketIndex]  []       now you need to actually store the bucket there.        this.storage[bucketIndex]  bucket       implement a collission detection scheme whereby you overwrite the respective value if the key matches, otherwise, add it to the end.         the for loop wont execute if there is nothing in the bucket if so, jump to line 45 instead        here is whats happening. If the key doesnt already exist, the key value pair gets added to the end of the bucket.        if the key matches, IT MUST BE THE SAME VALUE that the hashed key associated with that value previously, so, overwrite it.        for var i  0 i lt bucket.length i          var tuple  bucket[i]         if tuple[0]  key            tuple[1]  value           return                          bucket.push[key, value]             HashTable.prototype.remove  functionkey    var bucketIndex  hashFnkey, max   var bucket  this.storage[bucketIndex]    for var i  0 i lt bucket.length i      var tuple  bucket[i]     if tuple[0]  k        bucket.splicei, 1            dont worry about this generic hashing function please, not the point of my question var hashFn  functionstr, max    var hash  0   for var i  0 i lt str.length i      var letter  str[i]     hash  hash ltlt 5  letter.charCodeAt0     hash  hash amp hash  max      return hash  codepre

However, theres a convert on the left side of the codeWHEREcode statement and this causes my query to be very, very slow.p  pHowever, when I remove the convert, I do not get the expected results. When adding days, whenever I am in summer time I have to do 26, whenever I am in winter time its 25. This is because in the above example, in hours, code8  2code base is 8 and do  2 to get to my time now, which is 10 is compared to code10  2code base is 10, but its local, so to get to UTC0 Ill have to do  2. So code10 lt 12code, and Ill receive heartbeats from the last 22 hours instead of the last 24. In winter time, the problem is sort of the same, where Ill receive 23 hours instead of 24.p  pORIGINAL POST p  pI want to select heartbeats one every minute of the last 24 hours. My heartbeats are stored in a codedatetimeoffset7code field. Because I have a lot of heartbeats from different sources, my current codeSELECTcode is very heavyp  pcodeWHERE CONVERTDATETIME2, measurementdatetime gt CONVERTDATETIME2, DATEADDhh,  24, getutcdatecodep  pI found out that the reason of this being heavy is that a codeCONVERTcode is used on the codemeasurementdatetimecode column. So basically, Id like to skip that.p  pNow if I use the following linep  pcodeWHERE measurementdatetime gt CONVERTDATETIME2, DATEADDhh,  24, getutcdatecodep  pThe problem here is that not all 1440 heartbeats are selected, because the dates arent in the same timezone.p  pTo explain a bit more, consider the following codeSELECTcodep  precodeSELECT measurementdatetime AS Db value,        GETDATE AS GETDATE,        GETUTCDATE AS GETUTCDATE,        SYSDATETIME AS SYSDATETIME,         SYSDATETIMEOFFSET AS SYSDATETIMEOFFSET FROM Heartbeats WHERE measurementdatetime gt DATEADDhh, 26, GETUTCDATE codepre  pWhich results in 1440 rows, of which the first isp  precodeDb value            20150908 152206.0820000 0200 GETDATE             20150909 152137.003 GETUTCDATE          20150909 132137.003 SYSDATETIME         20150909 152137.0049636 SYSDATETIMEOFFSET 20150909 152137.0049636 0200 codepre  pNotice that the codeWHEREcode statement uses an offset of code26code. As you can see, looking at the time only I do not codeDATEADDhh, 24code before the codeGETDATEcode etc., the comparison isnt right. Somehow, if I compare my codemeasurementdatetimecode with codeDATEADDhh, 24, GETDATEcode the oldest datetime selected is code20150908 152206.0820000 0200code because its the first newer than code20150908 152137.003code. However, and heres the problem, you would expect to get 1320 results with code24code and codeGETDATEcode 13206022 and 1440 when using code24code and codeSYSDATETIMEOFFSETcode. However, both queries result in 1320 results with the oldest being code152206.0820000 0200code. Its like the offset gets ignored, which is going to be a problem when wintertime sets in I can hardcode code26code now, but then Ill have to change it to code25code in the winter.p  pI tried to declare the offset with tricksp  precodeDECLARE dtoffsetchar nvarchar50  CASTSYSDATETIMEOFFSET as nvarchar50 DECLARE dtoffsetint int  24  LEFTRIGHTdtoffsetchar, 4, 1 codepre  pBut this causes the query to be even more slow. I also tried to create a function of this int, which was a way to create a constant in SQL, but this didnt work query still very slow, 6 minutes, where if I simply write code26code its 3 seconds.p  pIm at a complete loss... p  pEDITp  precodeSELECT  measurementdatetime, CONVERTDATETIME2, 20150909 075112.3760000 0200, CONVERTDATETIME2, DATEADDhh,  24, getutcdate FROM    Heartbeats WHERE   CONVERTDATETIME2, measurementdatetime gt CONVERTDATETIME2, DATEADDhh,  24, getutcdate ORDER BY measurementdatetime codepre  pGives as first resultp  precode20150909 075112.3760000 0200  20150909 075112.3760000 20150909 075105.4130000 codepre  pAnd a total of 1440 records.

Negative 3885 pI would like to make use of the ij component of the XYZij point cloud, but according to the latest known issues document this feature is still in development.  is there anyway I could acquire early access to a beta version of this feature or implement my own comparable version  p  pwhat Im really going for is the point cloud as a zbuffer to mask off ocluded objects in an AR game i am working on.  if there is another way to achieve that, that would work too.  Im using Unity 5.1.3f personal and Im following the Augmented Reality sample.  p  pcurrently I get the depth at a given screen point and it checks every point in the point cloud and this is inefficient for checking more than one point per frame.  but if the depth at that point is less than the depth of the virtual element I can know that its not visible.  however the effect is not smooth around corners and naturally would be nice to be able to check more than one point per frame.p  pThanksp
