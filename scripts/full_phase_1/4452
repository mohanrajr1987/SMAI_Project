Positive 4452 pI have a table of values, something like thisp  precode     A   ...

I believe that may because the values in column A are not unique  they are categorical ordinal. So a particular codexicode can show up multiple times. Column F is either 1 or 0.p  pSo what Im trying to get is the subset of A in one column next to the corresponding rows of F.p  pAnother issue I think though not sure at all may be problematic is that when I print out codeAsubsetcode, its reindexed. In other words, the first row of codeAsubsetcode may in fact have been the 20th row in codeAcode, and the second entry in codeAsubsetcode could be from any row after the 20th row in codeAcode, and so on. p  pcodeAsubsetcode has no particular pattern, e.g.  every other row, values greather than codexicode, etc. The subset was determined based on some other column neither A nor F. So codeAsubsetcode is essentially obtained from codeAcode, but reindexed as stated above, relative order is maintained, so codeAsubsetcode could be something likep  precode   Asubset 1   x7 2   x4 3   x3 4   x2 5   x4 codepre  pWhen instead, it might be more helpful to havep  precode    Asubset 2   x7 4   x4 5   x3 7   x2 8   x4 codepre  pNotice the index didnt include row 6 from codeAcode, because, as an example, that row may not have met the criteria that I used to filter codeAcode. p  pBut the indexing is not whats important Im just trying to clarify what codeAsubsetcode is. What I care about is getting the subset of codeAcode and the corresponding rows in codeFcode.p

Negative 4452 pHow can I check programmatically, how much memory my program currently has allocated p  pI need it for an ASP .NET app, but i suspect the solution is general for all types of .NET applications. Ideally, the operation to get the currently allocated amount of memory, should be fast, since I will need to query it often.p  pEDIT Thanks for your answers. I will be using GC.GetTotalMemory for this task, since I need to use it for an ASP .NET application. After some experimenting, I have determined that it is fast and accurate enough for my needs. The suggestion to use Process PrivateMemorySize64 property will also work in general but as pointed out in the answers, for an ASP.NET application there will often be multiple AppDomains running in one process. I need the memory total perAppDomain.p

Negative 4452 pIn Stroustrups emThe C Programming Language Special Edition 3rd Edem, Stroustrup writes that the declaration and initialization of variables in the conditionals of control statements is not only allowed, but encouraged.  He writes that he encourages it because it reduces the scope of the variables to only the scope that they are required for.  So something like this...p  precodeif int i  readsocket lt 0       handle error  else if i gt 0       handle input  else      return true  codepre  p...is good programming style and practice.  The variable codeicode only exists for the block of codeifcode statements for which it is needed and then goes out of scope.p  pHowever, this feature of the programming language doesnt seem to be supported by g version 4.3.3 Ubuntu specific compile, which is surprising to me.  Perhaps Im just calling g with a flag that turns it off the flags Ive called are codegcode and codeWallcode.  My version of g returns the following compile error when compiling with those flagsp  precodesocket.cpp130 error expected primaryexpression before int socket.cpp130 error expected  before int codepre  pOn further research I discovered that I didnt seem to be the only one with a compiler that doesnt support this.  And there seemed to be some confusion in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions136548proconinitializingavariableinaconditionalstatementcthis questiona as to exactly what syntax was supposedly standard in the language and what compilers compile with it. p  pSo the question is, what compilers support this feature and what flags need to be set for it to compile  Is it an issue of being in certain standards and not in othersp  pAlso, just out of curiosity, do people generally agree with Stroustrup that this is good style  Or is this a situation where the creator of a language gets an idea in his head which is not necessarily supported by the languages communityp

Negative 4452 pI have some questions about session management. p  pI have decided to use a custom session manager class to have more control  over session state in my web site. I have started out by using Stephan Prodans Session Class a hrefhttpstefanprodan.spaces.live.comc11BlogPartBlogPartblogviewampcBlogPartamppartqscat3DC2523 relnofollowherea. Youll need to take a look to get a sense of what I  am talking about. p  p1 My first question pertains to how I persist and access my session information after a user authenticates or doesnt. In his example, sessions are created upon login  authentication as suchp  precode     Create new instance of session manager     SessionManagerltWorkbookProfilegt sessionManager           new SessionManagerltWorkbookProfilegt10      Register timeout event     sessionManager.OnEntryTimeout           new SessionEntryTimeoutDelegateltWorkbookProfilegtsessionManagerOnEntryTimeout       Get the users profile     UserProfile profile  UserProfile.GetUserProfilemembership.GetUserNameByEmailLogin1.UserName      Log profile amp start session     sessionManager.startSessionref profile      Store on the session a users object     sessionManager.SetDataMyData, UserObject, user.SessionId codepre  pOK, I understand the above code. What I dont completely understand is how I can  access session information as users interact with the system. For example, take the below code p  precodepublic partial class MyClass  System.Web.UI.Page      private UserProfile profile     private SessionManagerltUserProfilegt session      protected void PagePreInitobject sender, EventArgs e              session  new SessionManagerltUserProfilegt10           protected void PageLoadobject sender, EventArgs e               string UserName  sessionManager[profile.SessionId].UserName          profile  UserProfile.GetUserProfileUserName        codepre  pIn the above code I need to pass the users UserName to  to the GetUserProfile method in order to create an instance  of the authenticated users profile. But, I need to have the profile object to access the SessionId. Sort of  a Catch 22. What am I doing wrong here How should I be accessing session and profile information for each new page the user  visitsp  p2 the importance of the database when using sessions p  pMy second question relates to the use of the DB with sessions.  In Stefans class, all session information is stored in a session  object that persists as long as the user is authenticated. But,  in other online reading, I have seen examples where programmers  store session keys in a table in association with fkprofileid.  What is the purpose of this What is the best practice  p  pThanks for your time.p

All views render fine, but heres the catch I cannot build a User, it tells me codepasswordcode is a wrong method, so I guess the authentication logic has been bypassed. What should I do Am I doing it wrong altogether Should I drop polymorphic associations in favor of Single Table Inheritance Whatever I do, I have to make sure it plays nicely with Authlogic.p
Negative 4452 pOriginal problem What is the right column format for a unix timestampp  pThe net is full of confusion some posts claim SQLite has no unsigned types  either whatsoever, or with exception of the 64bit int type but there are counterexamples that invoke UNSIGNED INTEGER. The data types page mentions it only in a bigint example. It also claims there is a 6byte integer but doesnt give a name for it. It seems my tries with INTEGER being 4byte signed signed store unix timestamps as negative numbers. Ive heard that some systems return 64bit timestamps too. OTOH Im not too fond of wasting 4 bytes to store 1 extra bit top bit of timestamp, and even if I have to pick a bigger data format, Id rather go for the 6byte one. Ive even seen a post that claims SQLite unix timestamp is of type REAL...p  pComplete problem Could someone please clarify that messp

So i assume application for OS4 are not working on old ipodtouches  but there was no warring from the app store and it is even listed for download for ipod touch too. any ideas   p  pbase SDK is iphone device 4 and development target is iphone os 3. i works on iphones with os 3 but when i try it on my ipod touch with os 3.1.3 it crashed. and i am getting this error micmdstacklistframes Not enough frames in stack. I added a break on main.m and the app crashes even before getting to first line in main.m .. the debug is ok it crashes when i try to run it on the device. it works fine in simulator.p  pOne more thing, this is a universal app, and i am using uisplitview controller.. so i think when it runs on os 3 it breaks.. is there anyway to fix this  p

Negative 4452 pSo, I currently have a codeBoardcode class that is composed of codePiececodes. Each codePiececode has a color and a string that describes the kind of piece. It also has a 2d matrix with bits either set on or off, that allows me to know which pixels to paint with the desired color or not.p  pMy question is, which class should have the responsability to draw the pieces on the board On one hand, Id say the codePiececode class should do it. But to do it, Id have to pass a codeBoardcode as reference to codePiececodes codeDrawcode method and although its not terrible I find it kinda awkward. This raises the problem that Piece would have to know the Board class.p  pOn the other hand, I could just have the codePiececode have ap  precodeBoolean[,] IsPixelSetint x, int y codepre  pand Board would then have a method of the formp  precodevoid DrawPieceOnBoard      for int y  0 y lt height y          for int x  0 x lt width x              if piece.IsPixelSetx, y                  board.DrawPixelAtx, y, piece.GetColor                             codepre  pHow would you do it And why I cant see a clear winner in any of these approaches.p  pThanksp  h2edith2  pIm not talking about actually drawing things on screen. What happens is that Im implementing a Tetris game currently, no GUI and I need at every moment to set the Pixels of a Square on different positions on the board as it falls to the ground. The board basically only has an accessor and a mutator for each one of the x, y points. Lets now say I want to draw a Squarea type of Piece on the Board. Should the Piece know of the board and its Draw method make the changes to the Board, or should the Board access Pieces getter method and do it itselfp

Negative 4452 pI run a small blog network and on this I have a page where I show the latest blog posts from different blogs on my server. I would like to extend this page, to also include new posts from external blogs using rss feeds.p  pCurrently its easy to get the content, since its just a simple query selecting posts by date, but it troubles me to see how to make the most effective design when extending it.p  pThe easiest solution would be to periodic run a cronjob that import posts from the external sites, and then save them in the database. Though this creates the possibility that the posts could be altered in content or removed by the author, leaving me to display invalid content.p  pThe best solution would be if I dont have to save the posts, and instead just import them directly on the page.

Negative 4452 pWe have a quite common object in our application. In this case, well call it a Ball. Balls work fine, but in some configurations they act differently. It is currently set up like thisp  precodeclass Ball      private static readonly bool BallsCanExplode     static Ball              bool.TryParseConfigurationManager.AppSettings[ballsCanExplode],              out BallsCanExplode          public Ball  codepre  pThis works completely fine in practice. If the configuration is that balls can explode, they explode, and if not, not. The problem is that it is completely nontestable. I havent been able to figure out a good way to keep it testable, and still easy to instantiate. p  pThe simplest solution is to just decouple the ball and the configurationp  precodeclass Ball      private readonly bool CanExplode     public Ballbool canExplode  codepre  pThe problem with this is that what was once an isolated dependency in the Ball class has now spread to every single class that makes a Ball. If this gets dependency injected in, then the knowledge of exploding balls has to get injected everywhere. p  pThe same problem exists with a BallFactory. While every class could just go codenew Ballcode, it now has to know about a BallFactory that has to be injected everywhere. The other option is to use the Service Locator which is already baked in to the applicationp  precodeclass Ball      private readonly bool CanExplode     public Ball              CanExplode  ServiceLocator.GetltIConfigurationgt.GetballsCanExplode       codepre  pThis still keeps the configuration dependency in the ball, but allows a test configuration to be injected in. Balls are used so much though, that it seems like overkill to locate the service on every codenew Ballcode call.p  pWhat would be the best way to keep this testable, as well as easy to instantiatep  pNote There is both a dependency injection framework and service locator in the application, which are both used frequently.p

Negative 4452 pPardon the cast pun but I am a long long time Delphi developer.  I have stayed at version 6 for an eternity now because it was everything I needed for development.  However, lately Ive been thinking of getting into .NET because that seems to be the dominant direction for Win3264 EXE development.  My biggest concern is having something in .NET that serves as an equivalent to the VCL component model in Delphi.p  pLet me explain my biggest concern this way.  In Delphi, I can create a custom component that once completed, will become a full fledged member of the Delphi component palette widget panel, that I can drag and drop on to a form at design time, and use the IDEs property inspectoreditor to fill in properties pertinent to the component and even better, fill out code stubs for various programmer defined event handlers the latter is like VB and many other IDEs, I know.  But most importantly, I can create components that act as containers for other components.  At design time, I can add child components of a different type than the parent and conveniently fill out the properties and event handlers for the child instances using the same property editor paradigm as for top level components.  I have come to adore this capability and I would like to know if .NET has something equally facile at managingediting components that contain other components at design time.p

Negative 4452 pI have a WCF web service thats being consumed by both Silverlight and .NET clients.  In order to share the data contract types with both clients, the contracts are defined in two class libraries one Silverlight and one .NET. The files defining the data contract types are shared between the two library projects via links.p  pGeneration of a proxy to consume the service works nicely for .NET.  Specifically, data contract types from my .NET class library are reused as expected.p  pHowever, generation of a Silverlight proxy via SlSvcUtil.exe does not reuse the data contract types.  This is true whether I invoke SlSvcUtil.exe from the command line with the r switch or use the Add Service Reference dialog from Visual Studio.p  pThrough trial and error, Ive determined that a single type utilized in a single service method is the source of this problem.   If the service ceases to use this type, SlSvcUtil.exe generates the proxy as expected with types reused from the data contracts assembly.p  pNow that Ive narrowed the issue down to this type, Im not sure what to look for next.   The type does contain a member that implements IXmlSerializalble.  Could that cause this behavior What are some common causes for this  What are some good approaches for further troubleshootingp

Negative 4452 pI am creating a Java EE application that allows users to addremove socketinfo tables stored in a database from a web interface.  If the user enables a socketinfo from the web interface, the application server must create a socket listener for the incoming packets and process the data.  If the user disables or deletes the socketinfo the socket listener must be removed.  The entire product must be contained in a single ear, and preferrably compliant.  Some approaches I have considered but ran into problems with arep  ol lipCreate a JCA resource adaptor for sockets and use MDBs as the listeners.  The problem I ran into here was that I cannot figure out how to programmatically deploy MDBs for different sockets when the user adds them.pli lipCreate a SingletonService ejb that manages the daemon threads with careful synchronization.  The singleton ejb can be injected into the business layer so that CRUD operations and socket manipulation happen in the right workflow.  The problem here was that supposedly creating threads from EJBs is considered a bad practice and is not spec compliant even if the singleton life cycle is correctly handled and proper synchronization mechanisms are in place.pli lipPut the threads in the domain model another singleton and have the EJBs use the model.  This was the worst of all of them since application servers tend to have multiple classloaders, less container support in general, plus this suffers from everything 2. suffers from.pli ol  pAny idea how to correctly handle this situation in Java EEp  pEDIT An extension to this question  Assuming I decide to approach this problem like ewernli suggests in his solution 3, what do I gain by doing this in JCA with a custom interface to add internal threads that I would not get from a welldesigned singleton  While creating a resource adapter does not look like a monstrous task, it does not seem entirely trivial and could be a little time consuming and maybe even harder to follow for other developers.p

My app has a main context that lives for the lifetime of the app, with other smaller contexts being spawned occasionally for background tasks.p  pOne thing I have noticed is that NSManagedObjects appear to remain registered in the main context longterm and the only way to truly reclaim all the memory associated with pulling the objects from the DB is to call code[NSManagedObjectContext reset]code.p  pThis of course results in a nice drop in memory usage as all the registered objects from recently closed list views are properly ejected from memory, however it is annoying because you have just invalidated every object that was registered in that context that you still have a reference to i.e. objects that are refered to by views that are still open, and you now need to refetch all the these objects from the database to avoid exceptions for accessing an invalidated object.p  pIs this the only way of flushing out the registered object set from an NSManagedObjectContext, or is there a better way that successfully ejects all the registered objects you no longer have references to, but doesnt invalidate all the NSManagedObjects that are still alivep

Negative 4452 pNot sure if I should raise an issue regarding this, so thought I would ask if anybody knew a simple workaround for this first.

I understand this is not because of Dapper, but what could be considered a strange way of linking internally in the OleDbParameter classp  pWhen dealing with this either using other ORMs, raw ADO or my own factory objects, I would clean up the command object just prior to running the command and change the OleDbType to Date.p  pThis is not possible with Dapper as far as I can see as the command object appears to be internal. Unfortunately I have not had time to learn the dynamic generation stuff, so I could be missing something simple or I might suggest a fix and contribute rather than simply raise an issue.p  pAny thoughtsp  pLeep

Negative 4452 pInstead of retrieving the entire table of records for a Backbone collection Ive defined, I reckon its much more efficient to make use of the tastypie filters Ive created.

Negative 4452 pI am working on a PHPbased project management system that allows users to upload a variety of media files. To prevent users from uploading malicious files, the system verifies both the MIME type using finfofile and the extension using pathinfo against a whitelist.p  pThis has worked well, with one exception .FLA Flash movie authoring files. Unfortunately, finfofile cant parse a MIME type for these files. Instead it returns this somewhat misleading error messagep  pCDF V2 Document, corrupt Cannot read summary infop  pI verified the test .FLAs Im using arent actually corrupt.p  pObviously checking the extension only is insufficient, since all someone would have to do is give a malicious script an .FLA extension to bypass my safeguards.

Negative 4452 pI have 2 codeUIImageViewscode whose sizes are 50x50 and 60x60 pixel.p  pI use codeCGRectIntersectRectcode method to determine when one image touches the other. But these 2 images are 2 balls and sometimes code determines that these images are touching themselves when with your eyes you can see they dont touch. This happens because balls dont cover all spaces of image. So the corners of images are clear, but of course code doesnt care about this.p  pThe question is how can I solve how can I determine the frame of images that follow perfectly the circumference of ballsp

Negative 4452 pIm trying to implement a nice accordion effect on my app. My goal is to open up a cell when the user tap on it, diplaying additionnal content such as text as the cell height increase.

However I am experiencing a strange behavior, that ruins the whole effect.p  pIt appears that depending on the order in which the tableview will display its cells top  Bottom or Bottomup the cells textviews will overlap each other or not. As its a bit difficult to explain with word so here is it with images.p  pThose screenshots were taken from the TVAnimationsGestures Sample Code, without any changes made to it. It comes from the first version of the sample code without storyboardp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comT32Xm.png altNormal Behaviorp  pNow the version with the storyboard, first behaved well, but after a while, and without me touching the code it started drawing this p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com2Ysbu.png altOverlapping cellsp  pAnd I have the exact problem on my custom with my custom cells. p  pIt took me a while to understand what I think the problem comes from. If cells are drawn from the Top cell to the bottom, there is no such problem. However if cells are drawn bottom to the top, they will stack in reverse and therefore overlap each other. I dont think it is possible to control this behavior.  What gave me the hint, is that when I scroll down, forcing the top cell to redraw, they actually redraw nicely, and the screen looks like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com44LTG.png altMixturep  pA Mixture of overlapping cells and good cells.p  pAgain, this all comes directly from Apple sample code, without any changes.

Negative 4452 pI managed to implement a lookAt matrix for a camera successfully, since there are many sources describing it.p  pIve been trying to translate this from camera lookAt to model lookAt. I cannot seem to get it to work, and I assume I have a slight misunderstanding as to how a matrix is constructed. I am under the assumption that I dont need to change the translation for a model to look at a point, since its position should remain unchanged.p  pFirst of all, here is the relevant code. The lookAtRadians function should look at the point specified in the same frame of referance as its translation i.e. at  position  direction. However, there are some issues, which Ill show with screenshots. It does not check for direction.y being 1.0f or 1.0f, but that is trivial.p  precodevoid TransformMatrix3DlookAtRadiansfloat atX, float atY, float atZ, float toZRadians      Vector3D directionatX  x, atY  y, atZ  z     direction.normalize      Vector3D up0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f      Vector3D rightdirection.crossProductup     right.normalize     up  direction.crossProductright      mMatrix[0]  right.x     mMatrix[4]  right.y     mMatrix[8]  right.z     mMatrix[1]  up.x     mMatrix[5]  up.y     mMatrix[9]  up.z     mMatrix[2]  direction.x     mMatrix[6]  direction.y     mMatrix[10]  direction.z  codepre  pHere are the cross product and normalize functions, in case they are incorrect.p  precodeVector3D Vector3DcrossProductconst Vector3Damp rightVector const      const float NEWXy  rightVector.z  z  rightVector.y     const float NEWYz  rightVector.x  x  rightVector.z     const float NEWZx  rightVector.y  y  rightVector.x      return Vector3DNEWX, NEWY, NEWZ    void Vector3Dnormalize      float lengthx  x  y  y  z  z      iffabslength  1.0f         return      length  1.0f  sqrtlength     moveTox  length, y  length, z  length  codepre  pHere are some screenshots to describe my issue.

The rest of the matrix is identity. I have checked that this is the case which I will use for demonstrating the problems.p  pScreenshot a hrefhttpi.imgur.compSaNr.jpg relnofollowNo rotationap  pIf I move the lookAt point along just the X and Y axes, the lookAt seems to work correctly.p  pScreenshot a hrefhttpi.imgur.comXOd2B.jpg relnofollowX axis Y rotationap  pScreenshot a hrefhttpi.imgur.comdwKaV.jpg relnofollowY axis X rotationap  pHowever, when I combine the two i.e. move the lookAt point so both X and Y arent 0.0f, some Z rotation is applied, which shouldnt happen since UP x DIRECTION should always result in the RIGHT.y being 0.0f. The Z rotation will be applied using codetoZRadianscode which is not yet implemented.p  pScreenshot a hrefhttpi.imgur.comRIlTP.jpg relnofollowAdded Z rotationap  pAlso Ive found that if I then move the lookAt point down the Y axis, the model still follows the lookAt point, but it actually rotates around the global X axis or equivilant to that, at least.p  pScreenshot a hrefhttpi.imgur.comcGSRh.jpg relnofollowGlobal X rotationap  pNow, when the lookAt point moves to Z, the model has the correct Y rotation, but its X rotation is inverted. I checked my vectors at this point and I found that UP.y is negative, which shouldnt be possible it can be 0.0f, but not negative since DIRECTION and RIGHT should always wind the same way i.e. clockwise from DIRECTION to RIGHT. The only way UP.y could possibly be negative is if RIGHT is actually LEFT.p  pScreenshot a hrefhttpi.imgur.comZYLLc.jpg relnofollowInverted X rotationap  pThe model still rotates around the global X axis as it did when the lookAt point was Z.p  pScreenshot a hrefhttpi.imgur.comfpNWS.jpg relnofollowGlobal X rotation lookAt Zap  pAs I mentioned, this is likely a misunderstanding on the way matrices work, but it could be something else. Ive looked around for several days and I can only seem to find camera based lookAt functions. Any sources explaining the axes contained in the matrix have lead to the code presented in this post.p

Note that these child processes inherit fds from parent and hence end up listening on port X.p  pThe parent program has a handler for requests coming in on port X but the child process has no such handler it is a os.execved C programp  pI know that child process could close all fds, in which case the above situation will not arise. What happens to a incoming request on port X How is it processedp  pHeres what i have observed so far...

For .NET 4, it will automatically install it for the user if it is missing. However, the other requirements are not installed automaically. The best I have managed is for the installer to prompt the user asking if they want to download the prereq now, yes or no I have used the Install Url property of the launch condition to take them to the correct location. After the user has manually installed them they need to run our addin installer again.p  pWhat I am looking for is a way for my installer to automatically install the missing prereqs without pausing the installation, and without the user having to take uneccessary steps. Whether this means including the prereqs in the installer file somehow or getting the installer to do the download work.p  pThere is also a concern that because I have manually entered the Install url, it may become invalid at some point. Is there a more standardised way of doing this sort of thing that I am missingp  pThe app is not for internal use and we dont run IIS for deployemnet etc, out systems are mostly linux based. So we ideally want a single installer wuch as an MSI.p  pAny suggestions most welcomed.p  pRichardp

Negative 4452 pIm confronted by a strange jQuery problem. p  pI was asked to help figure out why a site broke recently. They are loading the latest version of jQuery from a CDN, and making liberal use of it, including features like codeattrcode. I have very little experience with jQuery Ive heard codeattrcode is broken, and Ive seen that it performs poorly, so I never use it. p  pAnyway, this code has things like codefoo  this.attrclass.split [0]code all over the place, and all of that broke recently. Apparently, codeattrcode used to return a String, and now it returns a jQuery object. Its simple enough to go through and change code like this to a somewhat more sensible codefoo  this.className.split [0]code, but I wonder if Im going about this the wrong way.p  pSo, my question is Is there a jQuery configuration setting to get codeattrcode to act like it did in the previous version, and return a String If not, has anyone else run into this problem How did you handle itp

Negative 4452 pI am trying to write OpenCV FFI in Racket and arrived at a point where arrays need to be manipulated efficiently. However, all my attempts to access arrays by using Racket FFI resulted in very inefficient code. Is there a way for fast access of C arrays using FFIp  pIn Racket, this type of manipulation is reasonably fast, i.e.p  precodedefine avector makevector  640 480 3 time let loop [i   640 480 3 1]     when gt i 0        invert each pixel channelwise       vectorset avector i  255 vectorref avector i       loop  i 1 gt  cpu time 14 real time 14 gc time 0 codepre  pNow, in OpenCV, there is a struct called codeIplImagecode that looks like thisp  precodetypedef struct IplImage      int  imageSize              sizeofIplImage      ...     char imageData         Pointer to aligned image data. IplImage codepre  pThe struct is defined in Racket as followsp  precodedefinecstruct IplImage     [imageSize int]      ...      [imageData pointer] codepre  pNow we load an image using codecvLoadImagecode function as followsp  precodedefine img   ptrref    cvLoadImage imagestestimage.png CVLOADIMAGECOLOR    IplImage codepre  pThe pointer codeimageDatacode can be accessed by codedefine data IplImageimageData imgcodep  pNow, we want to manipulate codedatacode, and the most efficient way I could come up with was by using pointersp  precodetime let loop [i   width height channels 1]  same 640 480 3     when gt i 0        invert each pixel channelwise       ptrset data ubyte i  255 ptrref data ubyte i       loop  i 1 gt cpu time 114 real time 113 gc time 0 codepre  pThis is very slow, compared to the speed of native Racket vectors. I also tried other ways, such as codearraycode, codecvectorcode that dont even come close to the speed of using pointers, except for writing a firstclass function in C that gets a function for running over the whole array. This C function is compiled to a library and bound in Racket using FFI. Then, Racket procedures can be passed to it and applied to all elements of the array. The speed was the same as with pointers, but still not sufficient to continue porting OpenCV library to Racket.p  pIs there a better way to do thisp

Negative 4452 pI am developing a game on Android, and it requires an Internet connection to be played. I know how to check whether a connection is available or not, but I am not sure what to do in case the connection is not available. p  pMy idea is to display a No Connection Available dialog to the user, with an Exit button right below it, so that he can close the app from the dialog and fix his connection. I would be doing this with the System.exit0 command.p  pHowever Ive read in many places that I shouldnt use that command or close my app, and instead let the OS handle this. p  pBut how can I solve this situation without using System.exit0p  pI believe the DrawSomething game also checks for an Internet connection and presents you with an Exit button in case you dont have one. Not sure what method they are using to close the app though.p

Negative 4452 pI currently have an application Im writing in c using .NET that requires me to start a timer as soon as a user sees an image on screen up until they respond with a key press.p  pNow I realise that practically this is very difficult given the monitor input lag and response time, the time the keyboard takes to physically send the message, the OS to process it, etc.p  pBut Im trying my best to reduce it down to mostly a constant error the response time results will be used to compare one user to the next so a constant error isnt really an issue. However annoying hurdle is the variable caused by the monitor refresh rate, as I gather when my onPaint message is called and done with, it doesnt mean the image has emactuallyem been processed and sent from the graphics bufferp  pUnfortunately time restrictions and other commitments would realistically restrict me to continuing this task in c for windows.p  pSo what I was wondering was if either handling all the drawing in OpenGL or DirectX or better still for me if it is possible to just using either OpenGL or DirectX to create an event when the screen is updatedp  pAnother suggestion given to me previously was regarding VSync, if I switch this off is the image sent as soon as it is drawn as opposed to sending images at a set rate synchronised to the monitor refresh ratep

This is apparently harder than one thinks, since the loginpage is handled semiautomatically by the Secure module.p  pWhen handling a normal HTTP form, the PlayFramework passes the form variables to the controller method as parameters. Using the standard Secure module, the login form contains only the username and the password, and these are passed to the authenticate method.p  pNow, I can create a custom loginform that includes a captcha, and I am also allowed to override the authenticate method in the Secure module. The problem is this I cannot change the parameters of the authenticate method to include the captchacode, or else it is no longer overriding the method in the superclass and the method is then never called.p  pHere is a simple login form, with the Captcha adapted from the yabe examplep  precodeextends main.html  set titleLogin   form authenticate  ltpgt     ltlabel forusernamegtUser name ltlabelgt ltinput typetext         nameusername idusername maxlength30         valueparams.username gt ltpgt ltpgt     ltlabel forpasswordgtPassword ltlabelgt ltinput typepassword         namepassword idpassword maxlength30  gt ltpgt ltpgt     ltlabel forcodegtPlease type the code below ltlabelgt ltimg         srcCaptcha.captcharandomID gt ltbr gt ltinput typetext         namecode idcode size18 value gt ltinput typehidden         namerandomID valuerandomID gt ltpgt ltpgt     ltinput typesubmit idsignin valueLog in gt ltpgt  form codepre  pHere is a simple authenticate method that emdoes not workem, because code and randomID are undefined.

Negative 4452 pASP.NET MVC 3 application.p  pI am trying to post form that has some dynamic fields which appear and disappear using JavaScript.  I am using IValidatableObject for doing server side validation on some of these dynamic fields. p  pWhen these fields are visible and I post the form, validation works fine and it gives appropriate error message in  the ValidationSummary and posts back. Now while these error messages are there and I hide these fields using p  pdocument.getElementByIdschoolNotListed.style.display  nonep  pand I try to post the form again, it pops up the ValidationSummary error each time. The control doesnt reach the controller neither does it reach the Validate function in the viewmodel.

Or can I clear the ModelState through javaScript p  pIf you have some suggestions as to how to approach it differently  p  pThanks  p
Negative 4452 pI found an unexpected issue while attempting to load a block within a magento module. The block name was MycompanyCustomerModuleBlockCustomerModuleDashboardDataBlock yes, the name is very long, but I added the module name all blocks related to the module to avoid confusing a dashboard.html with the one used by Magento Core. The issue is that, if I try to load such block, with the following commandp  precodethisgtgetLayoutgtcreateBlockcustomermodulecustomermoduledashboarddatablock codepre  pMagento raises the exception Invalid block type. I couldnt figure out what was wrong, since I copied the whole file from a block that works perfectly, and then I tried renaming the block to something shorter, such as simply emDashboardDataBlockem. With the shorter name, block is loaded correctly.p  pMy question is, therefore, are there any limitations in the length of Classes names I can always shorten the class name, but Id like to know if there are limits so that I can avoid having similar issues in the future. Thanks.p

Negative 4452 pIm trying to create a list of videos that a user may view. This needs to be dynamic because the list is going to update based on new entries being added to the database Im drawing the videos from.p  pFor my project, I access a list of videos from vimeo through its simple API. The current approach Im using to display all the info is through a webview object that gets its info from a StringBuilder object, htmlString.p  pMy XML for the view is the followingp  precodeltRelativeLayout xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid xmlnstoolshttpschemas.android.comtools androidlayoutwidthmatchparent androidlayoutheightmatchparent gt  ltWebView     androidididvideoMenu     androidlayoutwidthmatchparent     androidlayoutheightmatchparent     androidlayoutcenterHorizontaltrue     androidlayoutcenterVerticaltrue gt  ltRelativeLayoutgt codepre  pThe snippet of code that I use to build my list dynamically is the following. It returns to a function onPostExecuteString result which displays the webview with the html created from the for loop. p  precode    for VideoDataParser.Entry video  videos              htmlString.appendltpgt         htmlString.appendlta href  video.url  gt         htmlString.appendltimg alignleft src  video.thumbnailurl  gt         htmlString.appendvideo.title  ltbrgt         htmlString.appendvideo.description         htmlString.appendltpgt           return htmlString.toString codepre  pThe main problem I have now is that the images arent loading. I suppose thats because it requires another HTTP request to get the image. Is there another way to fix thatp  pAlso, I feel like this method of creating a menu might not be the best. When the user clicks the link, the flow of control goes outside of my activities and goes to a web browser where it will play the video. I want the activity to go to my own video player instead of using the internet upon clicking one of my options. There is most likely a better way of doing this, but Im unsure.p  pAny input would be awesome.p

And I am thinking to manage authorizations with roles using CanCan. p  pThe landscope I am thinking will be there will be a central rails app as the User management, administrator will CRUD users and manage authorizations there.

Negative 4452 pWe have a very basic application iOSAndroid done in Appcelerator that will receive a single update every week.

Weve been evaluating two services for all the push notificationsp  ul liStackMobli liParseli ul  pAppcelerator Cloud services is fine, but were not willing to pay that much. Parse and StackMob prices are lower than Appcelerator Cloud services and by our analysis, we could even use the free service on both services StackMob  60k push notifications  60k api calls, and Parse 1M api calls  1M pushes.p  pIf were going to use Parse, well need to buy the Android and iOS module from the Marketplace 30year each.

Negative 4452 pLong day and Im still beating my head against the desk over this one.  I think Ive read every jQuery ui autocomplete post here on stack overflow as well as most of the jQuery ui documentation.p  pThe Problemp  pI have a form in an asp.net mvc 4 application.  The form is for submitting a timesheetwork ticket.  The user selects a project and based upon that project an autocomplete field for work order number is enabled.  If the user chooses and existing work order number for the project, I populate two additional inputs with information about the work order.  I need to allow the user to type in a completely new work order with out selecting an autocomplete suggested work order and still have the form validate.  The problem is that validation fails if I do not select a suggestion from the autocomplete.  p  pThe jQueryui documentation does show that the methods close, disable, and destroy available to be used but Im not finding a good example of how to use them and which would actually be best to use in my situation.  Also it might be worth noting that I am using jQueryui 1.9p  pThe error I getp  pemSystem.Data.Entity.Validation.DbEntityValidationException Validation failed for one or     more entities. See EntityValidationErrors property for more details.emp  pThe error points to the line of code on my controller where I call db.SaveChangesp  precode        if  ModelState.IsValid                       db.WorkTickets.Addworkticket             db.SaveChanges          codepre  pThe model state is valid and I have no nulls trying to be saved.  My model does allow nulls on a few fields but in this case all fields are complete.p  pThe form works great if I choose an existing work order from the autocomplete widget or if I leave it blank.  It only fails if I type in a new work order.  I have set a break point and verified that the model does have the value I typed in for work ticket.WONumber before calling save changes.p  pHere is my jQuery.p  precodedocument.readyfunction

Negative 4452 pThanks for your timep  pI get some reports data on my hand and I want to present these data on the web.

Negative 4452 pI have looked around some now to find a solution to this problem. I found several ways that could solve it but to be honest I didnt realize which of the ways that would be considered the right C or OOP way of solving it. My goal is not only to solve the problems but also to develop a good set of code standards and Im fairly sure theres a standard way to handle this problem.p  pLets say I have 2 types of printer hardwares with their respective classes and ways of communicating PrinterType1, PrinterType2.p  pI would also like to be able to later on add another type if neccessary. One step up in abstraction those have much in common. It should be possible to send a string to each one of them as an example. They both have variables in common and variables unique to each class. One for instance communicates via COMport and has such an object, while the other one communicates via TCP and has such an object.p  pI would however like to just implement a List of all those printers and be able to go through the list and perform things as Sendstring message on all Printers regardless of type. I would also like to access variables like PrinterList[0].Name that are the same for both objects, however I would also at some places like to access data that is specific to the object itself For instance in the settings window of the application where the COMport name is set for one object and the IPport number for another.p  pSo, in short something likep  pIn commonp  ul liNameli liSendli ul  pSpecific to PrinterType1p  ul liPortli ul  pSpecific to PrinterType2p  ul liIPli ul  pAnd I wish to, for instance, do Send on all objects regardless of type and the number of objects present.p  pIve read about polymorphism, Generics, interfaces and such, but I would like to know how this, in my eyes basic, problem typically would be dealt with in C andor OOP in general.p  pI actually did try to make a base class, but it didnt quite seem right to me. For instance I have no use of a string Sendstring Message function in the base class itself. So why would I define one there that needs to be overridden in the derived classes when I would never use the function in the base class ever in the first placep  pIm really thankful for any answers. People around here seem very knowledgeable and this place has provided me with many solutions earlier. Now I finally have an account to answer and vote with too.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pTo additionally explain, I would also like to be able to access the objects of the actual printertype. For instance the Port variable in PrinterType1 which is a SerialPort object. I would like to access it like codePrinterList[0].Port.Opencodep  pand have access to the full range of functionality of the underlaying port. At the same time I would like to call generic functions that work in the same way for the different objects but with different implementationsp  precodeforeach printer in Printers     printer.Sendmessage codepre

Negative 4452 pI am writing some overview documentation of modules in my application.  I mainly use the codepagecode, codesubpagecode, codesectioncode and codesubsectioncode tags.p  pThe codepagecode and codesubpagecode tags allow me to give a nice hierarchical structure to the documentation, which is clearly visualized in the header of the web pages, or is used to build the table of contents when converted to Qt Help using QHelpGenerator.  Therefore, I understand that the pages should have unique names.p  pWhen I give my sections in my pages names like overview, introduction, section1, section2 and so on, it seems to work correctly when I build a subset of my documentation.  It seems that the section names dont have to be unique.p  pBut, when I build a larger set of documentation files, some pages are not correctly created anymore.  Could this be caused by the section names that are not globally uniquep  pI tried to find information regarding the globaluniqueness of section names but I cant find any statement regarding uniqueness of section names.  Do they have to be globally uniquep  pstrongEDITstrong I now notice that if one file has a section with id X and title A, and another file has section with id X and title B, that both get the same title in the generated documentation A or B.  So this seems to indicate that the ids should be globally unique.  Is there a way to circumvent thisp

Negative 4452 pIm in the midst of setting up a shopping cart that communicates with PayPal via IPN. Im using Miccah Carricks IPN with PHP and the WordPress Simple Paypal Shopping Cart.  After several weeks I have modified the cart to address my needs, but Im having an issue implementing the last of the fraud checks.  The third fraud check is to ensure that the amount paid is equal to the amount of the purchase.  My store contains numerous items so it is not possible to use a set number as Miccah Carrick does in his example.  I thought the answer would be to use PHP session variables, but havent had any luck.  Within the shopping cartp  precode  SESSION[carttotal]  totalpostagecost codepre  pSubsequently I tried to compare the mcgross variable, which is the amount paid returned by PayPal, to the the SESSION[carttotal] variable within the ipn file. Unfortunately this has not been successful.  To error check, I outputted the value of the session variable to the ipn error log, and it appears that the session variable is not being set or at least not being transferred as a result of leaving the page to complete the PayPal checkout.  I attempted to output a second session variable, which I know is set correctly and utilized in my various menus, and it also does not have a value in the ipn file. p  pDoes anyone have any suggestions on how to complete this fraud check         p

Negative 4452 pIm developing a local project with Tomcat, Servlets and JSP. This project is going to be a simple, singlelogin blog with a backend where the admin can login and create posts and pages. Im getting stuck in a situation where I need to enforce a session check for every servlet that is going to be present in the admin section. Upon successful admin login, I create a session flag that is going to be checked on every admin page as a security measure. p  pNow, since the only two methods that are going to be used for a servlet in this case are either doGet or doPost, should I create a method to check the admin session in each servlet and then call that method before each doGetdoPost, or is there a better implementation possiblep  pThanks.p

Negative 4452 pFor my final year project at university, I am extending an application called Rviz for Android. This is an application for Android tablets that uses ROS robot operating system to display information coming from robots. The main intent of the project is essentially the opposite of traditional augmented reality  instead of projecting something digital onto a view of the real world, I am projecting a view of the real world, coming from the tablets camera, onto a digital view of the world an abstract map. The intended purpose of the application is that the view of the real world should move on the map as the tablet moves around.p  pTo move the view of the camera feed on screen, I am using the tablets accelerometer and calculating distance travelled. This is inherently flawed, and as such, the movement is far from accurate this itself doesnt matter that much  its great material for my report. To improve the movement of the camera feed, I wish to use markers placed at predefined positions in the real world, with the intent that, if a marker is detected, the view jumps to the position of the marker. Unfortunately, while there are many SDKs out there that deal with marker detection such as the Qualcomm SDK, they are all geared towards proper augmented reality that is to say, overlaying something on top of a marker.p  pSo far, the only two frameworks I have identified that could be somewhat useful are OpenCV which looks very promising indeed, though Im not very experienced with C and AndAR, which again seems very focused on traditional AR uses, but I might be able to modify. Would either of these frameworks be appropriate here Is there any other way I could implement a solutionp  pIf it helps at all, a hrefhttpsbitbucket.orgzimmrmn3rvizforandroidsrc75d912943a6datdefault relnofollowthis is the source code of the application I am extendinga, and a hrefhttpscode.google.comprosjavasourcebrowserepoandroid relnofollowthis is the source code for ROS on Androida the code which uses the camera is in the androidgingerbreadmr1 folder. I can also provide a link to my extensions to Rviz, if that would also help. Thank you very muchp  pEdit the main issue Im having at the moment is trying to integrate the two separate classes which access the camera JavaCameraView in OpenCV, and CameraPreviewView in ROS. They both need to be active at the same time, but they do different things. Im sure I can combine them. As previously mentioned, Ill link toupload the classes in question if needed.p

Negative 4452 pIm using a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiEclipse28software29 relnofollowEclipsea to communicate with Arduino, through the Arduino platform. I can open a port using Eclipse or Arduino, but I cant connect to an opened port using Eclipse.

Not only are the different sandwiches uniquely named,         theyre also uniquely flavor profiled. A wonderful experience         indeedSandwiches Ive personally ordered are the Love Triangle,         Nacho girl, and the Al Bundy. For all you people out there who loved         the tv show, Married with Children, I think you could appreciate the         sentiment of having a sammie named after the No Maam enthusiast. I         know I did. Ahhh... tucks hand under pant waistbandAll kidding         aside, these sandwiches are pretty legit. You go to the counter and         order whichever sandwich sounds appealing and they can either add         chips or a drink to your meal. Simple. They have a wide range of         sandwiches that are made to please any meat lover, vegetarian, or         vegan palate alike. The huge variety is an A in my book. They can         even individualize and customize your sandwich to your liking. This         means that even the pickiest of eaters are welcomeSo if youre         interested in a fun place to enjoy a good sandwich, most definitely         give em a tryltschemadescriptiongt     ltschemadatePublishedgt20130430ltschemadatePublishedgt     ltschemaauthorgtAnn S.ltschemaauthorgt     ltrdftype rdfresourcehttpschema.orgReview gt ltrdfDescriptiongt codepre

Negative 4452 pFirst of all thank you for spending your time reading this.p  pI am currently stuck with a quite weird bug. I am a bit familiar with java but new to Netty. I am writing a Chat Program similar to the SecureChat in the examples. p  pMy problem is I am able to start the Server. The server binds to the correct address with no errors. But when I start the client, it connects to the server waits a couple of seconds and terminates, with no console output directing the type of the error.  The channels seem to be established and active, at least the corresponding methods are called.  The server should be sending a greetings packet when the ChannelConnection is active.  This greetings packet is not being received by the client. Or at least it seems like its not. brChatServer.javap  precodepackage main  import io.netty.bootstrap.ServerBootstrap import io.netty.channel.ChannelInitializer import io.netty.channel.EventLoopGroup import io.netty.channel.nio.NioEventLoopGroup import io.netty.channel.socket.SocketChannel import io.netty.channel.socket.nio.NioServerSocketChannel import io.netty.handler.codec.serialization.ClassResolvers import io.netty.handler.codec.serialization.ObjectDecoder import io.netty.handler.codec.serialization.ObjectEncoder  public class ChatServer   private final int port  public ChatServerint port     this.port  port   public void run throws Exception      EventLoopGroup bossGroup  new NioEventLoopGroup     EventLoopGroup workerGroup  new NioEventLoopGroup     try         ServerBootstrap b  new ServerBootstrap         b.groupbossGroup, workerGroup          .channelNioServerSocketChannel.class          .childHandlernew ChannelInitializerltSocketChannelgt              Override             public void initChannelSocketChannel ch throws Exception                      ch.pipeline.addLast                     new ObjectEncoder,                     new     ObjectDecoderClassResolvers.cacheDisablednull,                     new ChatServerHandler                                  b.bindport.sync.channel.closeFuture.sync      finally          bossGroup.shutdownGracefully         workerGroup.shutdownGracefully         public static void mainString[] args throws Exception      int port     if args.length gt 0         port  Integer.parseIntargs[0]      else          port  3000          new ChatServerport.run    codepre  pbr ChatServerHandler.javap  precodepackage main  import java.util.logging.Level import java.util.logging.Logger  import io.netty.channel.ChannelHandlerContext import io.netty.channel.ChannelInboundMessageHandlerAdapter import net.Packet import net.server.ChannelIntercommunicationHandler import net.server.PacketGreetings  public class ChatServerHandler extends ChannelInboundMessageHandlerAdapterltPacketgt  private static final Logger logger  Logger.getLoggerChatServerHandler.class.getName  Override public void channelActivefinal ChannelHandlerContext ctx throws Exception     ctx.writenew PacketGreetingsHello Welcome in Chat.

Negative 4452 pI wrote a program to generate all possible matrices with some conditions.p  pIt takes argument r and n, where r is the number of rows or columns in a matrix, and n is the maximum number that the sum in each row or column could bep  pThe conditions arep  ol liAll of the entries in each row and each column are in nonasccending orderli liThe sum in each row and each column should be smaller than or equal to nli liThe entries in the main diagonal are in nonascending order m[i][i]  m[j][j] for all ijli ol  pIt also has to generate all possibilities that satisfies the conditions.p  pSo, my approach was generating 0th row and column first, and then 1st row and column, and so on, until I reach rth row and column.p  pI did this by setting left top entry iteratively using for loops, and the calling genWat function with that left top entry, to generate all possible row entries and column entries using Boost library for combination with replacement.a hrefhttpphoton.poly.eduhbrboostcombination.hpp relnofollowhttpphoton.poly.eduhbrboostcombination.hppap  pThen it checks the conditions, and if the generated entries fits the conditionpass the test, they are stored in the matrixm in class Wat, and again, for the next row and columnI called it target. For example, if its dealing with the 2nd row and column, target is 2 iteratively setting left top entry and recursively calling genWat function with those left top entries.p  pIt continues until it generate rth row and columntarget  r, and if rth row and column satisfies the condition, it stores that Wat into the vector of Wat.p  pIt was probably the most complicated program I have written ever, largely because it uses both recursion and iteration, and I found this problem really interesting, but I could not make it work, and had to ask for help.p  pIt compiles, but when I ran the program with some small values of r and n, like 2 and 4, it keeps running forever. For r1, it throws outofbounds exception.p  pI think recursion is not quitting because the base case for the recursion is not defined well, but I have no idea why the program is not working.p  pThe code is admittedly messy and long and complicated, but please help me figure out how to do this problem.p  pThank you.p  precode    includeltiostreamgt     includeltvectorgt     includeltstringgt

Negative 4452 pI found multiple answers how to use sum with update but didnt get this right.p  pI want to update storage qty with invoice rows when creating new invoice. I need sum to handle same product in multiple rows.  Edit Sometimes I need to add new invoice rows after storage already updated with current ones so I need to mark the rows which are ok and sum new lines and reduce storage again.p  pWith couple of hours googling and a lot of testing I got it somehow workingp  precode UPDATE Storage  SET StorageQty  StorageQtySELECT SUM InvoiceQty            FROM InvoiceRows AS Inv            WHERE Inv.ProductId  Sto.ItemID            AND Inv.InvoiceId  InvoiceId  FROM InvoiceRows, Storage AS Sto  WHERE InvoiceRows.ProductID  Sto.ItemID  AND InvoiceRows.InvoiceId  InvoiceId codepre  pThe problem is I dont understand anymore how its actually working and I would need to add Invoicerows.StorageOk IS NULL to where clauses so that it would calculate the sum and update just the rows which are not updated yet. StorageOk is set to 1 with next clause to mark the lines to prevent multiple actions.p
Negative 4452 pLets say I want to assign IPv6 addresses to people from the 20010DB832 range.  Most are given out sequentially, but some are nonsequential.

In this case it would be easy enough to start at the beginning, discover that theres no record for 20010DB84 yet, and use that one.  But eventually the next available address may be thousands or millions of steps away from the start of the subnet.  Walking through the database one address at a time would be a bad idea.p  pI thought of adding another field to the table so that each address indicates how many available addresses there are between itself and the next one in the listp  precode                  Address                  Steps to next addr    20010DB8000000000000000000000001                   1   20010DB8000000000000000000000002                   1   20010DB8000000000000000000000003                   6   20010DB8000000000000000000000009            15728632   20010DB800000000000000000F000001                   2   20010DB800000000000000000F000003                       codepre  pbut Im not sure that helps me.  If an IP address is assigned somewhere in the middle of a sparse section, Ill still have to calculate how many steps there are from that address to the next one in sequence, and then go back to the closet assigned address before the new one and correct its steps to next addr as well.  Still seems like a slow process.p  pIs there a better way to do thisp

Negative 4452 pIm developing a emclientserver desktop application systemem in emCem. The client is merely a thin client that displays whatever the server tells it to. The server communicates directly with a local database which is used for storing metadata for a variety of systems. Each system will have its own table, whose structure is unique for that system.p  pIm trying to understand how I can tell the desktop application about the structure of the database without hardcoding anything, if that makes sense. I believe I need to look into a hrefhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiObjectrelationalmapping relnofollowObjectrelational mappinga but Im not quite sure where to start, as Ive never taken on a project of this complexity before. The idea would be that my server configuration somehow defines this mapping, and it would possibly be extensible so I can add more mappings for more systems in the future, or possible change the mapping. p  pemHow I see this system working is like thisemp  blockquote   pA user on the client uploads a file containing the metadata to the   server. The server would determine for which system type this file is   for, then parse the file to extract the metadata, and enter it into   the database. The way I had initially envisioned this happening is   that I would have a generic abstract classinterface which would need   to be derived for each system type. The derived class would then   implement a parsing function specific to that system type so it can   extract the metadata from the file. But the problem here is that I   have no way of entering the extracted data into the database, since   the server doesnt know the underlying structure of the derived class.p blockquote  pCan anyone point me in the right direction Ive found a hrefhttpnhforge.org relnofollowNHibernatea, which kind of sounds like what I might need, but Im not 100 sure. emPart of the problem is, as I stated earlier, I dont have a full understanding of some of these concepts.em Can anyone recommend some online resources that might help me to understand emObject Relational MapperORMem in general, and specifically how it pertains to em.Net Frameworkemp

Negative 4452 pIve been working on this problem for a week now and Im getting so frustrated with EF.  First off I have a super table  sub table pattern going on in the database.  It was designed with a codefirst approach.  The super type is called the WorkflowTask and is defined as followsbrbrp  precodelt language c gt public abstract class WorkflowTask       public int WorkflowTaskId  get set      public int Order  get set              public WorkflowTaskType WorkflowTaskType  get set      public WorkFlowTaskState State  get set      public ParentTask ParentTask  get set              public WorkflowDefinition WorkflowDefinition  get set   codepre  pAn example sub task would inherit from this task and provide additional propertiesbrbrp  precodelt language c gt public class DelayTask  WorkflowTask      public int Duration  get set   codepre  pThis is mapped to the database as followsp  precodelt language c gt public class WorkflowTaskEntityConfiguration  EntityTypeConfigurationltWorkflowTaskgt      public WorkflowTaskEntityConfiguration               HasKeyw gt w.WorkflowTaskId         Propertyw gt w.WorkflowTaskId.HasColumnNameId         Propertyw gt w.Order.HasColumnNameOrder         Propertyw gt w.WorkflowTaskType.HasColumnNameTaskTypeId         Propertyw gt w.State.HasColumnNameTaskStateId         HasOptionalc gt c.ParentTask.WithMany                 .Mapc gt c.MapKeyParentTaskId       codepre  pThe delay task is mapped as followsp  precodelt language c gt public class DelayTaskEntityConfiguration  EntityTypeConfigurationltDelayTaskgt      public DelayTaskEntityConfiguration              Propertyd gt d.WorkflowTaskId.HasColumnNameDelayTaskId         Propertyd gt d.Duration.HasColumnNameDuration            codepre  pHopefully you get the idea.  Now I have another sub type called a container task.  This task will hold other tasks and can potentially hold other container tasks.  Here is what it looks like as well as the mappingp  precodelt language c gt public class ContainerTask  ParentTask      public ContainerTask              base.WorkflowTaskType  WorkflowTaskType.Container         base.ParentTaskType  ParentTaskType.ContainerTask                  public ListltWorkflowTaskgt ChildTasks  get set    public class ContainerTaskEntityConfiguration  EntityTypeConfigurationltContainerTaskgt      public ContainerTaskEntityConfiguration                           Propertyx gt x.WorkflowTaskId.HasColumnNameContainerTaskId                    HasManyc gt c.ChildTasks.WithMany             .Mapc gt c.ToTableContainerTaskChildren, WorkflowContext.SCHEMANAME                        .MapLeftKeyContainerTaskId                        .MapRightKeyChildTaskId                         codepre  pAnd to make sure I include everything here is the ParentTask object as well as its mappingp  precodelt language c gt public abstract class ParentTask  WorkflowTask      public ParentTaskType ParentTaskType get set   public class ParentTaskEntityConfiguration  EntityTypeConfigurationltParentTaskgt      public ParentTaskEntityConfiguration              Propertyw gt w.WorkflowTaskId.HasColumnNameParentTaskId         Propertyw gt w.ParentTaskType.HasColumnNameParentTaskTypeId       codepre  pNow the item Im trying to save is the WorkflowDefinition object.  It will execute a bunch of tasks in order.  It is defined as followsp  precodelt language c gt public class WorkflowDefinition       public int WorkflowDefinitionId  get set      public string WorkflowName  get set      public bool Enabled  get set       public ListltWorkflowTaskgt WorkflowTasks  get set    public class WorkflowDefinitionEntityConfiguration                                     EntityTypeConfigurationltWorkflowDefinitiongt      public WorkflowDefinitionEntityConfiguration              Propertyw gt w.WorkflowDefinitionId.HasColumnNameId         HasManyw gt w.WorkflowTasks             .WithRequiredtgt t.WorkflowDefinition                            .Mapc gt c.MapKeyWorkflowDefinitionId          Propertyw gt w.Enabled.HasColumnNameEnabled         Propertyw gt w.WorkflowName.HasColumnNameWorkflowName       codepre  pSo with all that defined I am passing a WorkflowDefinition object into my data repository layer and want to save it using EF.  Since the object has lost its context while working on it in the UI I have to reassociate it so that it knows what to save.  Within the UI I can add new tasks to the workflow, edit existing tasks as well as delete tasks.  If there was only one level of tasks definition  tasks this would be cake.  My problem lies with there being the possibility of infinite levels definition  tasks  childtasks  childtasks, etc....p  pCurrently I retrieve the existing workflow from the database and assign the values over workflow is the value being passed in and is of type WorkflowDefinitionp  precodelt language c gt  retrieve the workflow definition from the database so that its within our context var dbWorkflow  context.WorkflowDefinitions                     .Wherew gt w.WorkflowDefinitionId workflow.WorkflowDefinitionId                     .Includec gt c.WorkflowTasks.Single   transfer the values of the definition to the one we retrieved. context.EntrydbWorkflow.CurrentValues.SetValuesworkflow codepre  pI then loop through the list of tasks and either add them to the definition or find them and set their values.  I added a function to the WorkflowTask object called SetDefinition which sets the WorkflowDefinition to the workflow within the context previously I would get a key error because it thought the parent workflow was a different one even though the Ids matched.  If its a container I run a recursive function to try and add all the children to the context.p  precodelt language c gt foreach var task in workflow.WorkflowTasks      task.SetDefinitiondbWorkflow      if task.WorkflowTaskId  0              dbWorkflow.WorkflowTasks.Addtask          else              WorkflowTask original  null         if task is ContainerTask                      original  context.ContainerTasks.IncludeChildTasks                                 .Wherew gt w.WorkflowTaskId  task.WorkflowTaskId                                 .FirstOrDefault             var container  task as ContainerTask             var originalContainer  original as ContainerTask             AddChildTaskscontainer, dbWorkflow, context, originalContainer                  else                      original  dbWorkflow.WorkflowTasks.Findt gt t.WorkflowTaskId                                                                task.WorkflowTaskId                  context.Entryoriginal.CurrentValues.SetValuestask       codepre  pThe AddChildTasks function looks like thisp  precodelt language c gt private void AddChildTasksContainerTask container, WorkflowDefinition workflow,                             WorkflowContext context, ContainerTask original              if container.ChildTasks  null return          foreach var task in container.ChildTasks                      if task is ContainerTask                              var subContainer  task as ContainerTask                 AddChildTaskssubContainer, workflow, context, container                           if task.WorkflowTaskId  0                              if container.ChildTasks  null                      container.ChildTasks  new ListltWorkflowTaskgt                 original.ChildTasks.Addtask                          else                              var originalChild  original.ChildTasks                        .Findt gt t.WorkflowTaskId  task.WorkflowTaskId                 context.EntryoriginalChild.CurrentValues.SetValuestask                            codepre  pTo delete tasks Icodeve found Icodeve had to do a two step process.  Step 1 involves going through the original definition and marking tasks that are no longer in the passed in definition for deletion.  Step 2 is simply setting the state for those tasks as deleted.p  precodelt language c gt var deletedTasks  new ListltWorkflowTaskgt foreach var task in dbWorkflow.WorkflowTasks      if workflow.WorkflowTasks.Wheret gt t.WorkflowTaskId                     task.WorkflowTaskId.FirstOrDefault  null         deletedTasks.Addtask   foreach var task in deletedTasks     context.Entrytask.State  EntityState.Deleted codepre  pHere is where I run into problems.  If I delete a container I get a constraint error because the container contains children.  The UI holds all changes in memory until I hit save so even if I deleted the children first it still throws the constraint error.  Im thinking I need to map the children differently, maybe with a cascade delete or something.  Also, when I loop through the tasks in the delete loop, both the container and child get flagged for deletion when I only expect the container to be flagged and the child to be deleted as a result.p  pFinally, the save portion above took me a good week to figure out and it looks complicated as hell.  Is there an easier way to do this  Im pretty new to EF and Im starting to think it would be easier to have the code generate SQL statements and run those in the order I want.p  pThis is my first question here so I apologize for the length as well as the formatting... hopefully its legible p

Negative 4452 pBasically, we have a certain area of the site we want only logged in members to see. If a nonmember clicks a link to this area, it should challenge them for a login that part I have down. If the person is already logged in, then the page would normally challenge for a login, it would instead redirect to the destination page. p  pThe Problem I have with this is knowing wherehow to grab the appropriate information to issue a redirect to forward already loggedin members.

Negative 4452 pHow can I train my own detector under Windows 7 in C or Matlab2012b I do not have Linux or I do not have Mac OSX. p  pI actually searched for it a lot before writing here. What I got isp  pI would like to train my own latent SVM model and use it in C. I checked out the OpenCV sample, cpplatentsvmmultidetect.cpp. It works with the existing models.  p  pAuthors website  a hrefhttpwww.cs.berkeley.edurbglatentindex.html relnofollowhttpwww.cs.berkeley.edurbglatentindex.htmla . It is mentioned that the software is tested using matlab2011a under linux and mac osx. However, I run matlab2012b under Windows7 64 bit. The code crashes very often, and I tried to fix the bugs, but I cannot cope anymore. p  pIs there any other source code which I can use under Windows 7 64bit  p  pOpenCV  a hrefhttpdocs.opencv.orgmodulesobjdetectdoclatentsvm.html relnofollowhttpdocs.opencv.orgmodulesobjdetectdoclatentsvm.htmla . There is no code implementation for training. Only detector can be used to detect the objects with existing models. p  pOn the other hand, somebody else asked the same question. a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11512637opencvlatentsvmopencv latent svma . However, The question was closed without being answered. Sad p  pAlso, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11832447opencvandlatentsvmdetectorOpenCV and Latent SVM Detectora is similar to my question. I am not satisfied with the answer, I read the same in the README file in the source code in Matlab. It does not help me to overcome the bugs in the source code, if I run under Windows 7. For this question, I wanted to add a comment to ask further, I cannot add because of my reputation I am new here.p  pI think, Latent SVM is fascinating and something new to detect the objects. Also, I think this should be a general issue to train our own model easily. It would be nice if anyone can guide. p  pAnyway, I do not understand why the training part is not implemented in OpenCV with the detector part  p

Negative 4452 pIm a beginner in Android programming, and Im working on a small bubble shooter game. However, I face a weird problem which I cannot figure out. I have a piece of code which handles the launcher of the app, if I program the whole code in class, the app runs smooth. However, if I cut the code into different classes there a noticeable lag in the movement of the launcher.p  pMy main question is what can cause this lag, and what is the best approach to avoid this now and in the future.p  pThanks in advance,p  pKind regards,p  pThis is my code when I program everything in one class.p  precodepackage com.example.bubbleshootergame  imports are delete to shorten

Negative 4452 pI know this is something very simple, but I cant remember how I completed this the last time. I have a pivot table and an associated pivot chart. The tablechart has an axis field that counts the number of entries from a certain column. Id like to filter out single entries so theyre not displayed in my pivot chart. Im able to add a filter to the pivot table and only have it show values that are greater than 1, but these changes arent reflected in the chart. Can anyone help me out I know this is a quick fix, but for some reason cant figure it out. Thanks.p
Negative 4452 pI have a simply orphan branch setup for a Git repository where I have three orphan branches with completely different folder structures. We have a .gitignore file in one of our branches to ignore some runtime created log files when the program in that branch is run. This works well until we try and change branches. Because the files are .gitignored, when the branch is switched, Git doesnt remove the ignored files and leaves them there when the branch is switched. Git then proceeds to see them as new files in the branch and wants to stage them for commit.p  pWhat is a work around for this other than adding folders left right and center to a .gitignore file in each branchp

Negative 4452 pI have a 4D array, a series of cubes essentially. These cubes are mostly filled with zeroes apart from subcubes of values of which I know the locations. I need to sum all these cubes together into one cube. I can do this simply with np.sum along axis3 but this is part of a monte carlo process and is done a huge number of times. I was wondering since I know where the subcubes are in the cubes can I sum them more efficiently since the majority of the summing operation would be adding zeros these cube are of significant size 1003 so if I can it will be a huge saving.

One of these determines distance on the fly, two use precalculated arrays with the information in but it must be aligned and summed  again probably wont make sense out of context but this is what I have so far p  precodedef coloumbicForces3carrierArray, cubeEnergeticDisorderArray, array cubeLen100  offsetArraynp.array[[0,0,0],[0,0,1],[0,0,1],[0,1,0],[0,1,0],[1,0,0],[1,0,0]] indicesnp.zeros7,3,lencarrierArray, dtypenp.int32 indices1aindices.reshape7lencarrierArray,3 tIndicescubeLenindices superimposedArraynp.zeroscubeLen,cubeLen,cubeLen,22, dtypemyFloat sumArraynp.zeroscubeLen,cubeLen,cubeLen for i in rangelencarrierArray     indices[,,i]offsetArraycarrierArray[i,14]  for c, carrierC in enumeratecarrierArray[,0]     for k, carrierK in enumeratecarrierArray[,0]         if ck             continue         for x,y,z in indices[,,k]         print c, indices[,,c]             ifcarrierC1                 superimposedArray[x,y,z,c]cubeEnergeticDisorderArray[x,y,z,c]1array[cubeLenx,cubeLeny, cubeLenz]             else                 superimposedArray[x,y,z,c]cubeEnergeticDisorderArray[x,y,z,c]array[cubeLenx,cubeLeny, cubeLenz]    b  np.ascontiguousarraya.viewnp.dtypenp.void, a.dtype.itemsize  a.shape[1] ,idx  np.uniqueb, returnindexTrue aUniquea[idx]  for i,j,k in aUnique     sumArray[i,j,k]np.sumsuperimposedArray[i,j,k]  for c, carrierC in enumeratecarrierArray[,0]     for i,j,k in aUnique         cubeEnergeticDisorderArray[i,j,k,c]cubeEnergeticDisorderArray[i,j,k,2]sumArray[i,j,k]  return cubeEnergeticDisorderArray   def coloumbicForcescarrierArray, cubeEnergeticDisorderArray, array cubeLen lencubeEnergeticDisorderArray[0,,,0] superimposedArraynp.zeroscubeLen,cubeLen,cubeLen,22, dtypemyFloat  for k, carrier in enumeratecarrierArray[,0]     superimposedArray[,,,k]cubeEnergeticDisorderArray[,,,k]array[cubeLencarrierArray[k,1]2cubeLencarrierArray[k,1],cubeLencarrierArray[k,2]2cubeLencarrierArray[k,2],cubeLencarrierArray[k,3]2cubeLencarrierArray[k,3]]      if carrier1         asuperimposedArray[,,,k]         bcubeEnergeticDisorderArray[,,,k]         superimposedArray[,,,k]ne.evaluatea1         cubeEnergeticDisorderArray[,,,k]ne.evaluateb1  sumArrayne.evaluatesumsuperimposedArray, axis3  for k, carrier in enumeratecarrierArray[,0]     acubeEnergeticDisorderArray[,,,k]     bcubeEnergeticDisorderArray[,,,2]     cubeEnergeticDisorderArray[,,,k]ne.evaluatesumArrayab  return cubeEnergeticDisorderArray  def coloumbicForces2carrierArray, cubeEnergeticDisorderArray, array x0carrierArray[0,1] y0carrierArray[0,2] z0carrierArray[0,3] x1carrierArray[1,1] y1carrierArray[1,2] z1carrierArray[1,3]  cubeEnergeticDisorderArray[x0,y0,z0,0]cubeEnergeticDisorderArray[x0,y0,z0,2]1.60217657e192995850595.79distance[x0,y0,z0], carrierArray[1,14]1e9 cubeEnergeticDisorderArray[x01,y0,z0,0]cubeEnergeticDisorderArray[x01,y0,z0,2]1.60217657e192995850595.79distance[x01,y0,z0], carrierArray[1,14]1e9 cubeEnergeticDisorderArray[x01,y0,z0,0]cubeEnergeticDisorderArray[x01,y0,z0,2]1.60217657e192995850595.79distance[x01,y0,z0], carrierArray[1,14]1e9 cubeEnergeticDisorderArray[x0,y01,z0,0]cubeEnergeticDisorderArray[x0,y01,z0,2]1.60217657e192995850595.79distance[x0,y01,z0], carrierArray[1,14]1e9 cubeEnergeticDisorderArray[x0,y01,z0,0]cubeEnergeticDisorderArray[x0,y01,z0,2]1.60217657e192995850595.79distance[x0,y01,z0], carrierArray[1,14]1e9 cubeEnergeticDisorderArray[x0,y0,z01,0]cubeEnergeticDisorderArray[x0,y0,z01,2]1.60217657e192995850595.79distance[x0,y0,z01], carrierArray[1,14]1e9 cubeEnergeticDisorderArray[x0,y0,z01,0]cubeEnergeticDisorderArray[x0,y0,z01,2]1.60217657e192995850595.79distance[x0,y0,z01], carrierArray[1,14]1e9  cubeEnergeticDisorderArray[x1,y1,z1,1]cubeEnergeticDisorderArray[x1,y1,z1,2]1.60217657e192995850595.79distance[x1,y1,z1], carrierArray[0,14]1e9 cubeEnergeticDisorderArray[x11,y1,z1,1]cubeEnergeticDisorderArray[x11,y1,z1,2]1.60217657e192995850595.79distance[x11,y1,z1], carrierArray[0,14]1e9 cubeEnergeticDisorderArray[x11,y1,z1,1]cubeEnergeticDisorderArray[x11,y1,z1,2]1.60217657e192995850595.79distance[x11,y1,z1], carrierArray[0,14]1e9 cubeEnergeticDisorderArray[x1,y11,z1,1]cubeEnergeticDisorderArray[x1,y11,z1,2]1.60217657e192995850595.79distance[x1,y11,z1], carrierArray[0,14]1e9 cubeEnergeticDisorderArray[x1,y11,z1,1]cubeEnergeticDisorderArray[x1,y11,z1,2]1.60217657e192995850595.79distance[x1,y11,z1], carrierArray[0,14]1e9 cubeEnergeticDisorderArray[x1,y1,z11,1]cubeEnergeticDisorderArray[x1,y1,z11,2]1.60217657e192995850595.79distance[x1,y1,z11], carrierArray[0,14]1e9 cubeEnergeticDisorderArray[x1,y1,z11,1]cubeEnergeticDisorderArray[x1,y1,z11,2]1.60217657e192995850595.79distance[x1,y1,z11], carrierArray[0,14]1e9 return cubeEnergeticDisorderArray codepre

It makes no guarantees as to the   iteration order of the set in particular, it does not guarantee that the   order will remain constant over time.  This class permits the ltttgtnullltttgt   element.     ltpgtThis class offers constant time performance for the basic operations   ltttgtaddltttgt, ltttgtremoveltttgt, ltttgtcontainsltttgt and ltttgtsizeltttgt,   assuming the hash function disperses the elements properly among the   buckets.  Iterating over this set requires time proportional to the sum of   the ltttgtHashSetltttgt instances size the number of elements plus the   capacity of the backing ltttgtHashMapltttgt instance the number of   buckets.  Thus, its very important not to set the initial capacity too   high or the load factor too low if iteration performance is important.     ltpgtltstronggtNote that this implementation is not synchronized.ltstronggt   If multiple threads access a hash set concurrently, and at least one of   the threads modifies the set, it ltigtmustltigt be synchronized externally.   This is typically accomplished by synchronizing on some object that   naturally encapsulates the set.     If no such object exists, the set should be wrapped using the   link CollectionssynchronizedSet Collections.synchronizedSet   method.  This is best done at creation time, to prevent accidental   unsynchronized access to the setltpregt     Set s  Collections.synchronizedSetnew HashSet...ltpregt     ltpgtThe iterators returned by this classs ltttgtiteratorltttgt method are   ltigtfailfastltigt if the set is modified at any time after the iterator is   created, in any way except through the iterators own ltttgtremoveltttgt   method, the Iterator throws a link ConcurrentModificationException.   Thus, in the face of concurrent modification, the iterator fails quickly   and cleanly, rather than risking arbitrary, nondeterministic behavior at   an undetermined time in the future.     ltpgtNote that the failfast behavior of an iterator cannot be guaranteed   as it is, generally speaking, impossible to make any hard guarantees in the   presence of unsynchronized concurrent modification.  Failfast iterators   throw ltttgtConcurrentModificationExceptionltttgt on a besteffort basis.   Therefore, it would be wrong to write a program that depended on this   exception for its correctness ltigtthe failfast behavior of iterators   should be used only to detect bugs.ltigt     ltpgtThis class is a member of the   lta hrefdocRoot..technotesguidescollectionsindex.htmlgt   Java Collections Frameworkltagt.     param ltEgt the type of elements maintained by this set     author  Josh Bloch   author  Neal Gafter   see     Collection   see     Set   see     TreeSet   see     HashMap   since   1.2    public class HashSetltEgt     extends AbstractSetltEgt     implements SetltEgt, Cloneable, java.io.Serializable      static final long serialVersionUID  5024744406713321676L      private transient HashMapltE,Objectgt map       Dummy value to associate with an Object in the backing Map     private static final Object PRESENT  new Object             Constructs a new, empty set the backing ltttgtHashMapltttgt instance has       default initial capacity 16 and load factor 0.75.           public HashSet          map  new HashMapltgt                  Constructs a new set containing the elements in the specified       collection.

Negative 4452 pThis is frustrating, I have spent a week trying to find out how to increase the performance of a custom autocompleteTextView in Android and come out with nothing. I have even implemented a Trie to keep some indexes of the list items in order to recover them when filtering, but in vain I guess I am using it improperly or the problem is somewhere else. I have implemented a FilterSearchTaskFragment in order to keep a reference to the last started task and to stop it when the user types fastly many characters in the autocompleteTextView.p  pInside the performFiltering method and the publishResults I have put some controls to recover the state of the actual running task with a call to the isCancelled method in order to make it finish as soon as possible but nothing, or better I have increased the performance a little bit when I test the app in the ADT simulator, but on a real device my tablet it seems like things remained the same... Why What am I messingp  pI have googled in order to find some useful answers but I didnt find anyone with the same problem. I have even asked around here on SO and someone told me to use a Loader, someone told me to use a Handler, but when the situation came to facts, no one replied to me and I have no idea on how I can use them in my situation.

Negative 4452 pI am a beginner.  This question is regarding what is construed from the following link regarding local value resolution of dependency property p  pa hrefhttpwpftutorial.netDependencyProperties.html relnofollowhttpwpftutorial.netDependencyProperties.htmlap  pIt is explained in the The magic behind it section within the webpage pointed to by this link that local value, if exists, is resolved by using a key against a dictionary which lives as a static dictionary within the control.  A key in the dictionary is unique per type e.g., button.  Please correct me if I am wrong, but to my understanding, there are two dictionaries, one with the key and the metadata that contain callbacks and a default value and another with the key and the value of the property.p  pFor the sake of better explaining my question, lets assume then that we have WPF application with two buttons and the Dependency Property in question is Background. In that case, if both of those buttons have two different backgrounds which are set as local value, we should end up with one Keyvalue in the first dictionary key and metadata, and two keyvalue in the second dictionary where the background values are stored.  And here comes my question, if the key must be unique per type, then how could we get in the second dictionary two different keys, each of which with distinct background value, corresponding to the two buttons   That is, dont both buttons have the same key as the key is unique per type i.e., both buttons have the same typep  pCan someone tell me where is the confusion p

Negative 4452 pIm a first time user on this forum.  Heres my scenario  On a userform, I have a combobox, two textboxes and an OK button.  When the user makes a makes a selection from the comboboxs dropdown list, the comboboxs change event is triggered and the event handling code fills in the textboxes with info from a worksheet based on the user selection.  The user can then edit the information in one or both of the textboxes.  The user then hits OK.  The OK buttons click event then writes the modified info from the textboxes back to the cells in the worksheet.  Appears to be fairly straight forward.  Heres my problem  the comboboxs change event appears to trigger every time its properties are referenced.  Specifically, the three instances in the cbCustomersUpdateOKClick subroutine below where the ListIndex property of the combobox is referenced.  I placed a Msgbox in the Change event code to indicate when the event triggered.  Using breakpoints at each of the three assign statements in the OK click event code, the combobox triggered Msgbox displayed at each of the three statements.  When the trigger occurs, it overwrites the edited info in the textboxes with the initial data from the combobox selection.  1 Why is the combobox change event triggering the way it is  2 What should I be doing to prevent this from happeningp  pI have been researching this for the past several hours and I havent found anything terribly useful.

Negative 4452 pImagine you have a factory where products are carried through the manufacturing process by belts.  Somewhere in the midst of this, it is necessary to split a stream of products from a single belt input out onto multiple belts based on some business logic.  Perhaps they need to be split out by color with output belts for red, green and blue products.  Perhaps its some sort of simple load balancing so products need to be split out based on percentages to each output belt.p  precode                                     ColorRed...        ...Products  ColorGreen...

The routing methodology should be able to be changed at runtime, as should the routing properties of  the individual output belts say changing the color criteria. If the routing methodology is switched back to one that was previously defined, it remembers the settings that were used.p  pTo keep my code generalized, the products are Entity objects, the split off belts are Route objects, the internal routing logic is a RoutingRule and the whole input beltinternal logicoutput belts thing is a Router.  Based on ProModels usage, the RoutingRule applies to the Router and not the individual Routes  if the rule is emRouteByPercentem then every outgoing Route should have a percent, whereas if it is emRouteByAttributeem, each Route would have an AttributeComparatorCriteria e.g. Color, , Blue set to test against incoming Entities.p  pemI can see that using the Strategy Pattern would allow flexibility to support and swap out RoutingRule objects for example the list of possible rules in the ProModel link however, I dont quite see how I can have the state information for each rule stored without tightly coupling the RoutingRule and the Route objects.emp  pstrongWhen applying the Strategy Pattern to this case, how should I store RoutingRulespecific attributes that apply per Routestrong  Im trying to think through my options and I dont like any of themp  ol liThe naive way would be to have member variables in the Route class for all possible RoutingRules codemPercentcode, codemEntityAttributecodecodemEntityComparatorcodecodemEntityCriteriacode ... but that would be horrible for obvious reasons.  Any time I added a new kind of RoutingRule, Id have to add member variables to the Route class.li liThe way I had been planning on doing it was with an associative array Dictionary or custom HashTable so attributes could be added or removed on the fly.  This is generally fine, but there has to be some code to a initialize the Rulespecific attributes b tell me which attributes need to be set for the current rule I cant just prompt the user for all the Route attributes because they may not all be used by the currently selected rule c validate that the Route attributes are in a consistent state.  li liThe only other way I can think of is to have the Route attributes stored inside the RoutingRule itself, an associative array inside an associative array so I can look up the Route by name and get a list of the exact attributes which apply per Route for the current rule. This way decouples the most, but then Im not sure how to structure it so that asking a Route about its properties is a transparent process.  Instead of codeRoute.AttributesstrAttrNamecode like 1 and 2, it would be more like codeRoutingRule.RouteAttributesRoute.Name.AttributesstrAttrNamecode. li liMaybe Im overthinking thisli ol  pIncidentally, Im doing this in VBA with all the limits that implies.p

Negative 4452 pSo I have a web app that looks perfectly fine at 1024x768 pixels on a laptop I really dont care about phone at the moment.  However, when I take the same app onto a tablet it doesnt fit even though the pixel availability is way higher than 1024x768.  It turns out that the tablets are scaling my app so it uses a 1.5 x css pixel multiplier causing it to be much larger on the tablets.p  pI have the following in my html headp  precodeltmeta nameviewport contentwidthdevicewidth, initialscale1.0gt codepre  pBut it still scales the web page.  This code seems to me that it would set the initial scale to 1.0 so that css pixels  hardware pixels, but it doesnt.  Im not really in a place to use full responsive design for this.  I just need to have tablets stop scaling my values for me.  How can I get this fixedp

Negative 4452 pI am pushing several transformation matrices and clipping regions onto WPFs drawingContext object.

But I have to retain all my matrices which I have pushed so far and also this a bit heavier process. And also I dont have separate Pop methods for each of the push operations like PopClip or PopTransformationMatrix etc.p  pI would like to know what is the best way to achieve this. Is the Pop is the only option to achieve this or is it possible mathematically to invert a Clip region p

Negative 4452 pIve been reading up on Component Object Model and, while Im confused why its needed, I have a question regarding it.  From my undertanding, its used to create interoperability between different languages, so my VB.NET program can communicate with my VC program.  Is there any other benefit to this  If my application is only vb.net communicating with a vb.net architecture, is there a need to include COM in my application  Do I have the option to not use COMp  pAwhile back I read something on a websitei will search for the source saying COM should only be used with vb6 and should not be included with your .NET applications, is this true  Since COM is clearly made compatible with .NET technoligies, would including it my project dull it down if theres better substitutes out therep
Negative 4452 pI do not have a security background and the most Ive dealt with cryptography is using snippets picked up from the net.

Negative 4452 pIve currently run in such a problem, in fact caused by the package maintainers, who simply did not consider that a certain preprocessor definition was not available until version X of a certain toolkit package required in the dependencies which is currently in testing stage. It was fixable by simply adding an additional codedefinecode to a header file in the base system, making the project compile fine again.br However, what if I had no root access to the system Could I also add a codedefine newmacro i am from the futurecode at compile time, e. g. to codeconfigurecodebr When reading myself through the matter, I thought that it might maybe work with the codeDEFScode environment variable, but apparently this is not meant to be used for C preprocessor directives.br So can this be accomplished at allp

Negative 4452 pI have a solution which contains a few WCF services and one web project which consumes the services as Service References.p  pNow when I am in one of the services and I want to get all usages of a method then I click on the method name and perform Find usages or Find references, but they do not point me to the usages in my web project. It will, however, point me to the generated Reference.cs.p  pI know that this is, in a way, correct behavior. But what I want is that Visual Studio or Resharper show me all the usages, even if it is the usage of the generated stubs.p  pIs this somehow possible with Visual Studio with Resharper or CodeRush Is there another plugin that can provide this functionalityp

Negative 4452 pIm currently working on a C WPF project using some of the Controls provided by Telerik and Im respecting the MVVM pattern withp  ul lipa Model containing the datapli lipa ViewModel presenting the data to the Viewpli lipa View displaying the datapli ul  pOf course, some of the Models can be reused and displayed in several Views in my case, the data can be the content of shapes displayed on different diagrams.p  pNow Im starting to design how to save the data. My goal is very simple when the user leaves the application and comes back, all Views must be identical in terms of content, color, fonts, size, position in space...p  pSaving a Model covers only the content part. How would you save the display properties like color, fonts, position in space, especially when several Views will rely on the same Model  Should I use Bindings and move all properties from the View to the Model  With the risk that the Model complexity will greatly increase p  pDo you have any solution where you keep the UI properties separated from the Model p  pAlso is there any best practice on how to save and load data the MVVM way p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 4452 pSo, Im reading Ian Abramsons Beginners guide to Oracle Database 10g coming from using mysql, and it mentions PLSQL and gives all these great reasons to use it, however Im doing this in preparation for a rewrite of several applications my company uses.p  pMy head programmer argues that if PLSQL is no more efficient at database access, all parsing and queries should be done on client side programs to spread the load out from the Oracle server. I argue that we should compartmentalize our code and attempt to avoid code duplication, and PLSQL may help us do that.p  pThe problem is, we dont actually know And this book doesnt tell us, how efficient database access is in PLSQL over an application running on a different machine that makes 35 largish queries per operation. I would think its more likely to run faster because to my knowlege plsql functions store and save their execution plans, and the traditional network overhead would be cut by a factor of 35 depending on the number of queriesp

The a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comtrainingkeyboardinputvisibility.htmlAndroid input method docsa state the followingp  blockquote   pWhen input focus moves into or out of an editable text field, Android shows or hides the input method such as the onscreen keyboard as appropriate.

This is happening for every soft keyboard weve tried as the input method.p  pI want to emphasize that when space is constrained, this view above the keyboard is generated internally by the system, not by any of our code.p  pThe main question is Is there a way and, if so, what is it to control the appearance of this for lack of better terminology proxy viewmdashat a minimum to get it to use our custom fontp  pIt would be an added bonus if we could also control the layout and appearance of the entire proxy area above the keyboard including the Done button. We are using a variation of the technique described in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma4986481535871this threada to have our activity use a locale different from the one set in the system, but the activitys locale clearly isnt being applied here. If it were, the button would be on the left and would read , as does happen if I change the devices locale to Hebrew.

Negative 4452 pWe have several Play 2 applications and modules and Im having trouble integrating IntelliJ IDEA 13 into my development process. I have an empty project based on the common parent of the apps and I have imported each app as a module using the import existing SBT project option.p  pMy problem is that every time I launch the project, IntelliJ causes SBT to completely rebuild all 9 modules at the same time. Since they all depend on one codesbt.lockcode file being available, its usually the case that 8 of the apps are waiting at any one time, and it takes 15 minutes for the refreshing to finish. As it spawns an sbt process for each module, my VMs 5GB of RAM and 5GB of swap space are entirely filled, causing further slowdown.p  pThis is completely unacceptable. Im going back to Eclipse if I cant solve this problem, event if IntelliJ IDEA is better suited to my development otherwise.

Negative 4452 pI want to create a new array for each category each time I iterate through my codeCategoriescode array. My data comes from a larger array. I want to create a unique array with the name of the appropriate codeCategoriescode array value each time I cycle through the outermost foreach. I may not have explained it very well so let me know if there is something I need to elaborate on. Here is a sample of the code I have simplified it to save space but only omitted keyvalue pairs where not needed for this example. This is probably not the most efficient way of doing it as I force it to cycle through all the menu items each time it runs for each category, but I will focus on that issue later.p  pemcodemenuItems[menuitems]code is the name of the master array from which I am getting all my informationem p  pcodemyvariablearraynamecode is the array that I wanted to create with a variable so that I can create a new one with a different name each time it runs through the codeCategories as Categorycode foreach loop.p  precodeCategories  array0Cat, 1Cat, 2Cat, 3Cat, 4Cat, 5Cat foreach Categories as Category    foreachmenuItems[menuitems] as CurrItem        ifCurrItem[category]Category                myvariablearrayname[Category.Entry][CurrItem[name]]          arraynamegtCurrItem[name],               idgtCurrItem[id],               amountgtCurrItem[amount],               onholdgtCurrItem[onhold],               categorygtCurrItem[category],               MeasurementgtCurrItem[Measurement],          codepre  pSo to sum up and explain it differently, I want to only have to write this chuck one time and each time it runs for each category entry it will make an new different array with a unique name a derivative of the category value ie code1Catcode etc. So I will end up with 6 different arrays holding the appropriate information.p  pI tried to use the codeCategorycode as the name of the array but it erred out.

Negative 4452 pI am still a little confused on how to implement a doubly linked list. After researching and finding some information about them, Ive got a good visual of how some of the basic functions work, such as add, remove etc. However, If I wanted to write a method for a DLList called countEquals E check that walks the entire list and counts the number of items in the list that are equal to the Check data item passed to the method, how would I write this. The instructions say I cannot use a foreach loop or an iterator, but a loop of some sort must be used. After the list is fully traversed, return the number of items that are equal to check. Here is some code that I have tried to write for this p  pinternal references of DLList Fields next, data, prev Members size, head and tail.p  precode public int countEqualsE Check       currentNode  head        int count  0       while currentNode  null              if currentNode.data  check                  count              else                  currentNode.next  currentNode                    return count    codepre  pIm not too sure if this will correctly walk a doubly linked list, if I have to write more pointer assignments I was thinking that because Im not adding any nodes, but just walking a list, I wouldnt need to do the pointers.                      p

Negative 4452 pI have to implement a fisheye transfromation with bilinear interpolation. After the transformation of one pixel i dont have integer coordinates anymore and I would like to map this pixel on integer coordinates using bilinear interpolation. The problem is that everithing I found on bilinear interpolation on the inetrnete see for example Wikipedia does the opposite thing it gives the value of one noninteger pixel by using the coordinates of four neighbors that have integer coordinates.  I would like to do the opposite, i.e. map the one pixel with noninteger coordinates to the four neighbors with integer coordinates. Surely there is something that I am missing and would be helpful to understand where I am wrong.p  pEDIT TO be more clear Let say that I have the pixel i,j2,2 of the starting image. After the fisheye transformation I obtain noninteger coordinates, for example 2.1,2.2. I want to save this new pixel to a new image but obviously I dont know in which pixel to save it because of noninteger coordinates. The easiest way is to truncate the coordinates, but the image quality is not very good I have to use bilinear interpolation. Despite this I dont understand how it works because I want to split my non integer pixel to neighboring pixels with integer coordinates of the new transformed image, but I found description only of the opposite operation, i.e. finding noninteger coordinates starting from four integer pixels a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiBilinearinterpolation relnofollowhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiBilinearinterpolationap

Negative 4452 pI just recently came upon web components and I find it awesome. Nevertheless, it is still not implemented in all browsers. For that reason im using webcomponents.js in Safari to be able to use HTML imports. There are several articles and tutorials on how to use the polyfills, but I still find the available documentation lacking. In my case, Im creating a visual style guide and need to be able to reuse certain bits of code many times all over the guide. I believe that HTML imports could help me in achieving my goal, but once I load webcomponents.js I dont know how to proceed. Notice that at this point Im not trying to create my own web components, just use imports to load certain HTML bits into certain locations in my visual guide.p  pThis is an example code Im usingp  precodewindow.addEventListenerHTMLImportsLoaded, function e      use strict      var links,         i,         content      links  document.querySelectorAlllink[relimport]  I have more than one link tag      for i  0 i lt links.length i  1          content  links[i].import         alertcontent This shows null       codepre  pNotice that when debugging I can see that codelinkscode is a list of links and that it has all the expected properties including import, but they are null.p  pThis is how my HTML source looks likep  precodeltdiv idouterdivgt     ltdiv idinnerdivgt         ltheadergt             ltinput idinputfield classtextinput typetextgt             ltspan idmessagespangtYou have notificationsltspangt             ltlabel idsnolabelgtltinput idsnocheck typecheckboxgt New onlyltlabelgt             ltlink relimport hrefmainmenu.htmlgt             ltul idmenugt                 ltli idreloadbuttongtReload Allltligt                 ltli idsettingsbuttongtSettingsltligt             ltulgt         ltheadergt         ltsection idsectionreposgt             lth4gtRepositorieslth4gt             ltlink relimport hrefrepolisting.htmlgt         ltsectiongt     ltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pNotice that there are two codeltlink relimportgtcode tags in use here.

Negative 4452 pI have a project that Ive built over the last several years, and it was started in Django 1.4. The server that runs this project is due for replacement, so Im in the process of migrating to the new server. p  pIm considering taking this opportunity to upgrade the project to Django 1.7. Ive been looking over the notes, and I know I will have some work to do regarding codeurlcode tags, and some other things. But, it looks like the main structure of projects has changed. In my project, the codesettings.pycode, codestaticcode folder, and the project wide codeurls.pycode filesfolder were all within the projects root directory. However, in 1.7 and probably a few version earlier it seems these filesfolders are moved to an app folder within the main project.p  pFor example, my 1.4 project has a project structure ofp  precodeproject folder      urls.py  all other app urls.py files are included in this main urls file      static  all static files for the whole project reside here      settings.py  project settings     .app          urls.py app specific urls codepre  pBut now, it seems the default project structure has changed to thisp  precodeproject folder       theres nothing here other than the manage script     .project           an app with the same name as the project now holds project wide files          urls.py  project wide urls file          settings.py  project wide settings within this app folder          static  project wide static files to be held here  codepre  pSo, will I even be able to run my project in 1.7 given the new project structure p

Negative 4452 pIm looking into building a web app in golang to deploy to google app engine, but Im not sure whether to use the memcache store or the datastore from this a hrefhttpsgodoc.orgcode.google.compsadboxappenginesessions relnofollowsessionsa package. Is there a rule of thumb as to when to use each type of store I understand the main pros and cons, the datastore data will always be there but is much slower to access and the memcache data is much faster to access but may not always be there. So are there any situations or types of application that would use one type of session store from the otherp

Negative 4452 pI need some help accurately trimming video using the FFmpeg C api. What Im seeing is when the input video stream has a timebase of 148000 it correctly selects the trimmed start and end times. However when the input video stream has a timebase other than 148000 the trim is incorrect. p  pTime bases of 130000 and 124000 trim half the expected video stream length  10s instead of 20s. 125 trims almost nothing at all  the output file size is only a few kb.p  pThe audio stream appears to always be trimmed correctly. p  pFor example if I try to trim the first 20s of a video whose video stream time base is 130000, the output mp4s length is 20s. It has first 10s of video and first 20s of audio.p  pI emthinkem Im incorrectly calculating the endtime but Im not sure why its correct for 148000 timebase streams.p  precoderecord[i].starttime  avrescaleqint64t starttime  AVTIMEBASE , defaulttimebase, instreamgttimebase record[i].endtime  avrescaleqint64t endtime    AVTIMEBASE , defaulttimebase, instreamgttimebase codepre  pHere is a more complete sample of codep  precodeint numofstreams  ifmtctxgtnbstreams ifnumofstreams gt 0       keeps track of each streams trimmed start and end times     struct streampts record[numofstreams]      for i  0 i lt numofstreams i          AVStream instream  ifmtctxgtstreams[i]         AVStream outstream  avformatnewstreamofmtctx, instreamgtcodecgtcodec         if outstream              LOGEgt Failed allocating output stream             ret  AVERRORUNKNOWN             return closeconnectionret                   ret  avcodeccopycontextoutstreamgtcodec, instreamgtcodec         if ret lt 0              LOGEgt Failed to copy context from input to output stream codec context             return closeconnectionret                  outstreamgtcodecgtcodectag  0         if ofmtctxgtoformatgtflags amp AVFMTGLOBALHEADER             outstreamgtcodecgtflags  CODECFLAGGLOBALHEADER          AVRational defaulttimebase         defaulttimebase.num  1         defaulttimebase.den  AVTIMEBASE           determine startend times for each stream         record[i].index  i         record[i].starttime  avrescaleqint64t starttime  AVTIMEBASE , defaulttimebase, instreamgttimebase         record[i].endtime  avrescaleqint64t endtime    AVTIMEBASE , defaulttimebase, instreamgttimebase           avdumpformatofmtctx, 0, outputfile, 1      if ofmtgtflags amp AVFMTNOFILE          ret  avioopenampofmtctxgtpb, outputfile, AVIOFLAGWRITE         if ret lt 0              LOGEgt Could not open output file s, outputfile             return closeconnectionret                    ret  avformatwriteheaderofmtctx, NULL     if ret lt 0          LOGEgt Error occurred when opening output file         return closeconnectionret           while 1          AVStream instream, outstream          ret  avreadframeifmtctx, amppkt         if ret lt 0             break          instream   ifmtctxgtstreams[pkt.streamindex]         outstream  ofmtctxgtstreams[pkt.streamindex]           copy packet         pkt.pts  avrescaleqrndpkt.pts, instreamgttimebase, outstreamgttimebase, AVROUNDNEARINFAVROUNDPASSMINMAX         pkt.dts  avrescaleqrndpkt.dts, instreamgttimebase, outstreamgttimebase, AVROUNDNEARINFAVROUNDPASSMINMAX         pkt.duration  avrescaleqpkt.duration, instreamgttimebase, outstreamgttimebase         pkt.pos  1           write the frames were looking for         ifpkt.pts gt record[pkt.streamindex].starttime ampamp pkt.pts lt record[pkt.streamindex].endtime              ret  avinterleavedwriteframeofmtctx, amppkt             if ret lt 0                  LOGEgt Error muxing packet                 break                                avfreepacketamppkt       codepre

Negative 4452 pImagine you have a MDI window QMainWindow  QWorkspace. You open the first QWidget maximized as a subwindow, and you will leave it open. Everything great. Next, you open a second QWidget also as a subwindow, but in this time normal  not maximized. What happens The second subwindow adapts to the first subwindow and maximizes itself. When I applying the method emresize 0, 0em in the second subwindow,  and then open the second subwindow, during the first subwindow is already running, then the following happens The first subwindow adapts to the second subwindow. This is the behavior of a MDIform.p  pWhat I want None of subwindows should influence each other. When I open maximized the first subwindow, should open the second subwindow normally. Is this possiblep

Negative 4452 pIm trying to use Angularstraps affix service to programmatically attach affix behavior to 3 different elements two of these must respond to whether the target browser is roughly desktopwidth or greater in which case they MUST NOT affix, and the third must always affix.  A complicating factor is whether or not the receiving device is either a desktop browser or a mobile device amp further whether said mobile device is either in landscape or portrait mode, because there are stylistic adjustments required for various device breakpoints, and this drives changes to the affix offsets for these three elements.p  pTo this end Ive managed to put together some logic for handling these different cases, and to keep sane Ive located the logic for my use of affix within its own directive attached to my Angular app.  Ive also isolated logic for detecting orientationchange events in its own directive, and within my affix directive Ive got a callback setup to trip on orientchange, which calls my handleFixes function, which in turn calls my helper functions to recalculate the proper offsets and then calls affix on each affixed element to update its behavior.p  pIn theory this should work fine.  In practice it looks like the affix service is unable to attach callbacks to scroll, click or resize events, because its expecting targetEl to be an element but instead its undefined.  As a result, affix isnt working at all.p  pI emthinkem whats happening is my directive definition isnt properly communicating the intended target element the BODY tag into affix, but that may not be the end of it.p  pHeres my directive definition strongEDITEDstrongp  precode N.B.

Negative 4452 pI have been working on making a neural network that has a goal, of hitting a moving target, it has inputs based on the distance from the shooter to the target from both axis, the rotation of the shooter, and the wind speed. p  pEvery 5 seconds the shooter resets to a different position on the screen.p  pI have attempted to use a back prop algorithm, by giving calculating the error based on the distance the bullet hits from the target, and if the shooter doesnt fire a shot in the 5 second window there is also an error propagated.p  pMy network however does not seem to be

Negative 4452 pI am trying to understand how I should treat data in a blade template for a form. Lets say I have a view to which I send data from an agestable from the db. For example I will get these data from 2 columns in the agestable id, age 1, 40  2 ,41 and so on. Then my form displays a selector where you can chose your age, example 40. Now.. when I perform the post I need to send the id of that age, in this case 1 and not the number 40 so that I can store it in a userdetails table that references the Agestable example in column ageid of userdetails table, in this case 1. What I am thinking is I need the id in the selector but it needs to be hidden so that when I post the data I only get the id and not the 40.. but maybe thats not how you do it in laravel and eloquent. Any hintp

Where the value comes from another function we can also assume that the value goes up by something constant, but is calculated by another function.p  pAnd to continue printing this on new lines for each whole second. I have come across two problems so far.p  p1 I am unable to write a function that prints a value every second. Ive tried using emthreadingem and emtimeem, but I havent been able to get it work.p  p2 If I set a sleep timer for 1 second, it must take several milliseconds or way smaller time measurements to then calculate the function before it prints the above line. I figured that after several hundredthousand calculations, my time and values would no longer be accurate.p  pSo far, I have borrowed this from another threadp  precode def updatei   threading.Timer1, update, [i].start   sys.stdout.writestrir   sys.stdout.flush   printi   i  1 codepre  pThis function doesnt work how I imagined. I thought that it would up the value of emiem by one each time, and put that value back in the update function. It just keeps printing out the same value each time. Honestly, Im not sure why, and I tried going line by line to figure it out, but alas I cannot.p  pThanksp  p2.0p
Negative 4452 pI have written a simple python script that fetches my ip.p  precodeimport urllib import socks import socket  set the proxy and port socks.setdefaultproxysocks.SOCKS5, 127.0.0.1, 9150  initialize the socket socket.socket  socks.socksocket  store the URL that we want url  httpscheck.torproject.org  open the URL and store it into response response  urllib.urlopenurl  parse the response html  response.read  print to console print html codepre  pNothing too complex, however the problem starts when analyzing the response from check.torbrowser. The site will always give me an address that is different from my currently running Tor browser that is on the same page. However, the html response will say that I am being routed through the Tor network but it doesnt look to be coming from the standard tor browser. The latter part I understand, though I did not include it in the code above, I was playing with UserAgent strings and other headers, so I will chalk it up to that being the primary cause. What I do not understand is where in the hedouble hockey sticks did the IP come from that was served as a response from the py scriptp  pMy next question, which builds on top of all this, is how do I connect my python script to the tor network correctly After a little googling, I found that tor will block traffic for everything other than the socks protocol and that an alternative is to use privoxy in conjunction with tor. My initial thought is to do some kind of routing that would result in the layering of software. In my mind, it would look likep  pPython  Privoxy  Tor  Destination p  pMy end goal in all of this is to grab a .onion based address and saveread it. However, I have put that to the side after all of these problems started occurring. A little info to help get better answers I am using a Windows machine, though I have a Linux one if there is some functionality that may be present there that would help this process, and I am using Python 2.7 though, again, this can be easily changed. p  pI would like to ask that the steps to make all this happen be laid out  or at least some linksdirection, I am by no means afraid to read a few good blogstutorials about the subject. However, I feel like this is really a couple of seperate questions, and would require quiet a lengthy answer so I would be more than happy to just know that I am on the right path before I rip more of my hair out p

Negative 4452 pIm trying to determine which style applies to an element by taking into account both inline and class styles. Javascript parses both of these into objects, but styles that are not set are empty strings, not codeundefinedcode. If styles that are empty e.g. codewidthcode have no effect, regardless of how specific the rule, then my goal is trivial.p  pHowever, in order to override codedisplaynonecode with the default rule dynamically, I know that codedocument.getElementByIdele.style.display  code works and, while I know it doesnt actually add a codedisplaycode inline style, are there any styles that do have an effect when set empty in CSS If this is the case, I would have to parse the style and stylesheet strings manually to see if the property was defined.p

Negative 4452 pThe CSV file is comma delimited, contains embedded delimiters and quotes.

As you can see the field appears to have a leading quote, but it is actually embedded. The field5 does not have a trailing quote. The result of the import puts blanks in fields 5 and 6 and pushes the field5 data in bold into field7 which, later on in the process, causes a Max Field Length violation.p  pIs there an attribute

Negative 4452 pIm trying to set up animating in a list of items in React. Im using Velocity for the animations, and using codereactaddonscodes codeTransitionGroupcode. The easy part is using the index of the item in the list to stagger them in, but theres a problem when I load additional data from the server, and add them to the list the index of the new items are from 20 to [x], so they wait 20  300ms before the first one animates in. Given a number, say 23, is there an easy way to boil this down to 3 remove 20 in this case, if the number were 55, boil it down to 5. This should be really basic, but I cant get my head around an elegant solution. Any help would be greatly appreciatedp

Negative 4452 pBasically I am trying to create an app that passes data filled in an EditText on on one fragment, into a TextView on another fragment on a button clickThe buttons is in the first fragment with the EditText. I use the SlidingTabLayout. I have 2 java classes that both extend Fragment and both inflate separate xml layoutsin the onCreateView. I have a java MainActivty with a public classSectionsPagerAdapter that extends FragmentPagerAdapter, which depending on the swipe of the user displays 1 of the 2 Fragment classes. I am really confused on how I can send data between the 2 fragment sot that from the EditText in 1 fragment can get sent to the TextView in the other fragment on a button click. Could the suggested solutions be explained as simple as possible because I am relatively new to Android Studio. Many thanks in advance.p

Negative 4452 pThe questions is fairly simple.p  pDoes Google Datastore Transactions Optimistic Concurrency Control or notp  pOne part of the documentations says that it doesp  blockquote   pWhen a transaction starts, App Engine uses optimistic concurrency control by checking the last update time for the entity groups used in the transaction. Upon commiting a transaction for the entity groups, App Engine again checks the last update time for the entity groups used in the transaction. If it has changed since our initial check, an exception is thrown. a hrefhttpscloud.google.comappenginedocsjavadatastoretransactions relnofollowSourceap blockquote  pAnother part of the documentation indicates that it doesntp  blockquote   pWhen a transaction is started, the datastore rejects any other attempts to write to that entity group before the transaction is complete. To illustrate this, say you have an entity group consisting of two entities, one at the root of the hierarchy and the other directly below it. If these entities belonged to separate entity groups, they could be updated in parallel. But because they are part of the same entity group, any request attempting to update one of the entities will necessarily prevent a simultaneous request from updating any other entity in the same group until the original request is finished. a hrefhttpscloud.google.comappenginearticlesscalingcontention relnofollowSourceap blockquote  pAs I understand it, the first quote tells me that it is fine to start a transaction, read an entity and ignore closing the transaction, if I saw no reason for updating the entity.p  pThe second quote tells me that, if I start a transaction and read an entity, then I should always remember to close it again, otherwise I cannot start a new on the same entity.p  pWhich part of the documentation is correctp  pBTW. In case the correct quote is the second one, I am using a hrefhttpsgithub.comobjectifyobjectify relnofollowObjectifya to handle all my transactions.

Negative 4452 pMy company and i is developing an angular application that gets its data from our own build API.p  pThe API is build in codenode.jscode using codeexpresscode and runs on port code8080code.p  pWe sell licences to medium sized  huge companies.p  pA common problem we have with our clients is that once they try to log in to the system they get rejected by their own firewall because it does not allow traffic on port code8080code. Which means that each of our clients will have to run by their own IT department to get our system to work.p  pThis is ofcourse  always a bad start with new clients. p  pSo my question is is there a way to avoid this either by choosing a safer more common port or am i doomed to have this embarrassing remark on my systemp

Negative 4452 pThis question is for Continuous Web Jobs. p  pstrongMain Questionsstrongp  pHow can we VIEW or programmatically LOG the current memory amp network status of a VM running a Continuous Web Jobp  pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pOur web job is scraping some API and we keep getting 500 errors. We believe that the VM is firing too many threads for API requests  and then because of network limitations  when the responses come back, too many responses come back at the same time, overloading the VMs network limitations.p  pstrongSide Questionsstrongp  pHow would you use MS Azure to Web scrape  and make sure you dont overload in terms of memory  network the VM its running on p  pIt seems that for background processing, these VMs are built for CPU calculation  not for WebAPI scrapingp

Negative 4452 pmay be somebody can help me I am using log4net for logging and I configured an appender to log to a SQLServer database. When logging I create my own LoggingEvent object that contains a set of properties I want to log. This LoggingEvent is then given to the logger.p  pProblem One of the properties is an object of class CobDate it encapsulates a certain close of business date  for those that might be interested. The only attribute here is a DateTime value.p  pNow, I know how to retrieve a property from the logging event and pass it as parameter to the INSERT commandTextp  precode  ltparametergt             ltparameterName valuecobgt       ltdbType valueDategt       ltlayout typelog4net.Layout.RawPropertyLayoutgt         ltkey valueCOBDATE gt       ltlayoutgt             ltparametergt codepre  pBut this fails with error Parametervalue could not be converted from CobDate into DateTime.. So I assume some conversion method is missing in my own created CobDate class Which onep  pOn the other hand I know how to pass a date into the insert commandp  precode  ltparametergt     ltparameterName valuetimestampgt     ltdbType valueDateTimegt     ltlayout typelog4net.Layout.RawTimeStampLayoutgt   ltparametergt codepre  pbut this is only the current datetime as a timestamp  not the CobDate property I want to use...p  p What can I do Is there i certain method I must override in my new CobDate classp

Negative 4452 pI have the need to show a different view controller for compact vs regular size classes. The difference in views is too great for the regular use case. My app used to just work based off of iPad Storyboard vs iPhone Storyboard. On an iPhone it shows some text, and on an iPad it shows a PDF. Would I have to do this in code, by creating a different container view controller, or are Size Classes not the tool for thisp
