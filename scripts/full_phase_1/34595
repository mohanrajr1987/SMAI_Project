Positive 34595 pI am creating an application meant to run on windows 7. I have researched on the internet and it says that Windows 7 comes with the .net framework 3.5. As a result I have set the target framework for my wpf application to use the .net framework 3.5p  pIs it safe to distribute this application without publishing it knowing that the users will have windows 7 or latter Or should I create an installer p  pThe application works on most computers but it crashes on some. Could this crash be related because of not creating an installer and running the application directlyp
Positive 34595 pThis is a bit of a potentially multipart part question. My goal is to either be able to reset UI changes that users make, limit changes that users can make, in order to have a consistent environment in a multisession lab situation.p  pI have played with some registry settings that allow me to set background which I want to be a solid color and such, but the changes dont get applied till after a restart. Thus far I have found do way to Refresh the UI. And, ideally I could do this without a restart. In addition, if someone where to set a Theme, then my simple registry hacks are overridden and even after a restart they dont make a difference, so I would like to just disable the ability to set Themes. Now, I found a hrefhttpwww.askvg.comallkindsofrestrictionsforwindows2000xp2003andvista relnofollowthisa, but its all pre Vista references, and I am unable to make changes to the Policy key in HKCU. So, my questions are 1 Is there a way to limit certain changes to the UI programmatically And... 2 Is there a way to Refresh programmatically after resetting those changes I do allowp  pFor what it is worth, I am testing this with Windows 7 Home, but I would like to find a solution that would work in Windows 7 Pro up to various versions of Windows 10.p  pAny help is greatly appreciated.p

Positive 34595 pThis is what Im trying to figure out. p  pIm familiar with having a Development and separate Production working folders for a code base.p  pWith Git however you can just have a Production environment and create a branch of it to work on. The problem I have is that I need the contents of the Production folder to be access while working on it.p  pWhat Im looking for is to have a Development and Production folder on Windows network. All work is done on the Development folder then pushed to the Production folder. However right now when I have this setup and view the contents of the Production folder the files dont appear in there just the standard gitinit filesp  pFor example Test.txt existing in Development and Production folders. I want to keep the Production version live. I edit the Development version of text.txt and then push the changes to Production which over writes the change in Production, when I go to the Production folder I then can open text.txt and see all changes.p  pRight now however when I push changes the file does not appear in Production just the standard GITinit files that are created. How do I resolve this where files exist it both location and can push changes from one location to another all on a windows networkp
Positive 34595 pI have an application that is communicating to a device over serial port, i would really like to inspect the protocol for what it is sending to initiate the link, and make an application that runs across TCPIP instead.p  pThe thing is, i dont have a serial port on my machine ofcourse as no machines has that today.p  pWhat i thought i could do was to install a Virtual Serial Port on my windows 7  p  pa hrefhttpwww.ftdichip.comDriversVCP.htm relnofollowhttpwww.ftdichip.comDriversVCP.htma  and make that appear as a COM port, installing it doesnt give me any new ports though so no clue how that is supposed to work.p  pMy thinking was i could in this driver set it up to communicate to a IP address instead of a physical device, but seems windows want a device connected physically to show a new port p  pAm i doing something totally wrong here  anyone knows how it can be done  p  pI saw other products online and tried also to install the com0com it does give some drivers but not sure exactly how they can be setup or if that is something that can achieve what im trying to do. p  pIts a hobby project so dont really have the money to try to purchase some of the nonfree applications that appears to say they can do it  so wonder if theres a standard or free package that can do it.p
Positive 34595 pI am using ConEmu as a dropdown terminal for windows 7.  Rather than cmd, Im using the cygwin shell.  To have ConEmu recognize cygwin, in strongConEmu  Settings  Startupstrong, I specified my named task to call my Cygwin.bat file.  IE, when ConEmu is launched, it calls my cygwin.bat file under CProgram FilesCygwinCygwin.bat.  This is great because I have many custom aliases in my cygwinhome.bashprofile file that also work in ConEmu.p  pThe problem is when I open a newtab in ConEmu I like to work with several tabs in a single window.  This is the Create new console or new window hotkey, which Ive mapped to ctrlT.  The new terminal loads up, but all of my custom commands in .bashprofile are lost.  In fact, it saysp  precodesh cd yourpath No such file or directory sh cd yourpath No such file or directory  XBBL2Q8D151TEC004043 cygdrivecUsersXBBL2Q8  codepre  pThis doesnt occur when I load ConEmu initially, only when I load a new tab.p  pAny ideas of why the new tab is not reading the .bashprofilep  pThanksp
Positive 34595 pI would like to copy the Robocopy.exe file from a Windows 8.1 system and run it on a Windows 7 PC. Both PCs are running the 64bit variant of their respective OS. Is this possible in any way At present I just get the error that it is not a valid Win32 application.p  pThe reason I wish to run it is because the newer version has the J switch.p

Positive 34595 pI have a script on a Server 2008 R2 VM which calls to the shell to coderobocopycode a bunch of files into a local directory and then, several seconds later, checks if a certain 2.5 MB .msi exists. It kept returning false even though coderobocopycode successfully completed and visible inspection reveals the file is there on time. I reproduced this bug on my local Windows 7 with a scriptp  precodeSet objFSO  CreateObjectScripting.FileSystemObject Set objWshShell  CreateObjectWScript.Shell Dim file  file  LargeFile.exe  objWshShell.Run xcopy .. amp file amp  ., 1, True WScript.Echo EXISTS  amp objFSO.FileExistsfile codepre  pcodeLargeFile.execode is an executable around 7MB. I place it one directory above my script, execute the script, and it prints codeEXISTS Falsecode. I ran the script several times with this result before some switch flipped and it started reporting codeTruecode consistently.p  pIt still happens intermittently on my VM. It will work correctly several times, Ill do something else for a few minutes, and when I come back it stops working again.p  pWhats going on here I need to use the shell for copying because the network is iffy and causes codeobjFSO.CopyFoldercode to crash.p

Positive 34595 pIve been given the task of changing all our legacy software installation packages to conform to Win 7 and 8. Previously our software would run on XP and Win Server 2003 and would simply be installed into the program files folder and run without any worry.  Nowadays, or since the introduction of UAC, installing into the program files opens up some issues regarding privileges when it comes to file creation, changing and deletion. Furthermore the whole wow64 redirection thing, where our legacy applications would be run from a different folder than the actual installation folder Program files x86.p  pstrongCut to the chasestrong Our legacy software is running on dedicated computers, only used for running our SW. Ive previously bypassed the whole problem with UAC and WOW64 redirection as a hotfixhack by simply installing the software outside the program files folders.  Now we are looking for a permanent solution, and I was actually thinking of making my previous hotfix the solution. So simply install our software on for example csoftware and by doing so bypass the whole issue with UAC and WOW64.p  pstrongQuestionstrong What are if any the pitfalls when installing legacy x86 software outside the program files folderp

Negative 34595 pI had this idea of registering an event in a base custom page on every button.  I can check  if it was a save or edit and then do an authorization and validation.

Negative 34595 pI know that in MySQL, UNIQUE constraits dont treat NULL values as equal.  So if I have a unique constraint on ColumnX, then two separate rows can have values of NULL for ColumnX and this wouldnt violate the constraint. How can I work around this  I cant just set the value to an arbitrary constant that I can flag, because ColumnX in my case is actually a foreign key to another table.  What are my options herep  pPlease note that this table also has an id column that is its primary key.  Since Im using Ruby on Rails, its important to keep this id column as the primary key.p  pNote 2 In reality, my unique key encompasses many columns, and some of them have to be null, because they are foreign keys, and only one of them should be nonnull.

Negative 34595 pLets say that I have a simple Ruby app where I want the first argument if any to specify the environment codeTESTcode, codeDEVELOPMENTcode or codePRODUCTIONcode with codeDEVELOPMENTcode being the default if no argument is given.

Negative 34595 pI have a thought provoking question, in relation to the use Entity Framework EF to persist data. My intended application is not a typical LOB scenario where the standard CRUD operations are done on individual records.p  pInstead, what I would like to use the data stored within my entities, create some Matrices by combining the data on several Entities and do some intensive numerical math. Throughout this intensive process, properties upon the Entities will be continually accessed and updated.p  pMy concern is that the act of accessingupdating the properties on EF Entities will severely reduce the speed of the entire operation, due to all the Lazy Loading, the NotifyPropertyChanged and PropertyChanged, PropertyChanging function calls and the calls to the SaveChanges function on the EF context object... with respect to standard C objects.p  pAny thoughts on how to mitigate the speed issues, at the expense of some of the niceties that EF offersp  pRegards, LiamVp

Negative 34595 pI thought this should be easy, but... geesh A vendor gave me a fairly simple demo program meant to showcase some trivial icon animations.  The target platform is an embedded system MX51 with accelerated OpenGL ES 2.0OpenVG and EGL support.p  pUnfortunately, the demo also has an annoying dependency on a few Qt utility classes e.g., QImage.

Negative 34595 pJust when I get quite familiar with SQL statements once again, when pulling data from Google Analytics, I found that they dont use SQL, but rather, use Dimensions and Metrics and the combinations of them.p  pWhy is a reason for that  I think it doesnt have a SQL interface or a plain web server log download  If so, how do SQL statements translate to Dimension, Metrics and Segment and Filtersp  pIt seems that Metrics tend to be the aggregates such as countem or averageem, and Dimension tends to be the logged values themselves such as Browser  IE or Country  Australia, which is the same as the codegroup bycode values.  Filters is like conditionals, and what about Segmentp  pIt seems that if we specify Dimensions, then it automatically does a codegroup bycode and display that field as well.  It does countem or sumem usually.

Negative 34595 pI am learning about NServiceBus and MSMQ.  I was told that transactional queues in MSMQ are BAD and using them is really bad for performance.  Does anyone know why  I am guessing this comes from the notion that it uses DTC and everyone knows that the DTC is not really a scalable solution.  It seems to me that there are a couple of reasons that MSMQ with NServiceBus is not all that bad, but I dont know if I understand how it works completely.  Looking at this logically, I can think of 3 places where NServiceBus might use transactions in order to get guaranteed deliveryp  ol liWhen sending a message across the network, you might want to use a transaction to ensure that the message has gotten to the remote queue before you discard it.li liWhen reading a message from a local queue, you might want to make sure that it is handled successfully before discarding it.li liWhen publishing a message to multiple subscribers, you might want to make sure that it reaches ALL of them before discarding it. I really hope this is NOT what NServiceBus doesli ol  pCan anyone set me straight as to how NServiceBus does thisp

Negative 34595 pAs part of a larger project, I want the ability to take two bodies of text and hand them to a merge algorithm which returns either an automerged result in cases where the changes are not conflicting or throws an error and potentially produces a single text document with the conflicting changes highlighted.p  pBasically, I just want a programmatic way to do what every source control system on the planet does internally, but Im having a hard time finding it. There are tons of visual GUIs for doing this sort of thing that dominate my search results, but none of them seem to make easily accessible the core merging algorithm. Does everyone rely on some common and well understood algorithmlibrary and I just dont know the name so Im having a hard time searching for it Is this some just minor tweak on diff and I should be looking for diff libraries instead of merge libraries p  pPython libraries would be most helpful, but I can live with the overhead of interfacing with some other library or command line solution if I have to this operation should be relatively infrequent. p
Negative 34595 pIm inexperienced when it comes to WCF and I cant really figure out a painfree way to mock WCF services. p  pThe situation A client and a server that both have access to an interface defining the service, like suchp  precodepublic interface ICustomerService    [OperationContract]   Customer GetCustomerint id  codepre  pNow, my first question if theres a reason why you wouldnt wanna make the client and server share the same interface type that defines the service in a shared library. Of course, it simply isnt a possibility if the consumers of the service arent .NET or if you expose it to third parties that dont have the library, but me sharing it when it emisem a possibility does not hurt those other scenarios, right  p  pSecondly, if its not a bad idea, how do I actually get Visual Studio to reuse the service interface I manage to get it to share the codeCustomercode type by checking codeReuse typescode, that is also defined in the shared assembly, but it still regenerates the interface. p  pBut regardless of those issues, though, how do I make the client mockable If I go through the VS generated Service References, I get a concrete type to work with, but I dont want my code to ever refer to that type directly, I would like to talk to an interface. If I expose the generated client as codeICustomerServicecode, which works, I dont have a codeClosecode method, as the interface does not define it. p  pI also thought of the following approach and abandon the autogenerate client entirely and just write the client myself as its trivialp  precodepublic interface IServiceClientltTgt      void Close     T Services  get    public class CustomerServiceClient  ClientBaseltICustomerServicegt, ICustomerService, IServiceClientltICustomerServicegt      public Customer GetCustomerint id              return base.Channel.GetCustomerid           public ICustomerService Services              get  return this        codepre  pThat works and I can expose it as codeIServiceClientltICustomerServicegtcode to my IoC container, but with the caveat that its now codeclient.Services.GetCustomer1code and that Ive lost the benefit of regenerating my client easily when the codeICustomerServicecode interface changes. Its trivial code to add, but might still be annoying to maintain this.  p  pAnother possibility is taking advantage of the fact that the generated class is codepartialcode. It also works when I do thisp  precodeinterface ICloseable    void Close   interface ClientInterface  ICustomerService, ICloseable    partial class CustomerServiceClient  IClientInterface    codepre  pBut that created a bogus class and interface, which isnt a disaster but not very pretty. p  pBefore I go down either route, is there anything obvious Ive overlooked p
Negative 34595 pIs there a way to display song title on the multitasking bar, and multimedia section of the lock screen in a background audio app, like the iPodMusicVideo apps  So far my app works in background, responds to media playback controls on the multitasking bar, lock screen, headphones, external accessory, etc. and handles interruptions, but this is the one thing missing. p  pOr is this not possible with the current API which of so far I have not been able to find any information.p  pOne thing I wanted to check was if Pandora did this, but as I cannot use the app from Australia, I cant verify this.

Where do the values for usernamepassword come when I start FB again in the first placestrongp  pI assume that the login activity still retrieves the codesavedInstanceStatecode, but how could that be avoided  or else, where are those UI states actually stored, in order to delete them But also, shouldnt the restarted app, after all its processes are killed,  already be in a new lifecyclep  pSame problem is with the stock browser if i leave the browser and Im on the login page of for example gmail.com where the usernamepassword is entered but form not submitted yet, then killing the browser process, the values username entered into the form will still be there after restarting the app again after its been killed.p

There are a few cases where some of the properties in the code are reserved words in MySQL, such as release.p  pThere are a few solutions, 1 rename properties in the code and subsequent gettersetter methods, also update code that invokes those methods 2 annotate the property in the code with Columnnamerelease. This tells hibernate to quote the name when talking to the database.p  pId prefer to stay away from the first approach to reduce the chance of breaking more stuff. The second approach is ok, except it becomes MySQL specific. In our dev. setup we use HSQL which doesnt like the backticks around those column names.p  pI looked at the org.hibernate.mapping.Column class and I see it has getQuotedName methods that I could potentially override if I could subclass Column and tell Hibernate to use my own Column class. p  pWhats the best way to resolve this issue based on the preferred approach of a not having to refactor the codebase bc of changing property names, gettersetter methods, etc and b wanting the app to still work in HSQL and MySQL.p  pIt would be reasonable to have a property in properties file that could be toggled to switch onoff some Column naming fix. Which reminds me, I tried using a custom naming strategy and overriding the columnName method to surround the column name in backticks...this doesnt work, even on MySQL.p

Negative 34595 pSo, I love my Macbook, and she loves me.  We have our ups and downs, but for the most part our relationship has been strong.  Recently though we had a fight.  it started out simply enough.  I was asking her to do more, trying to be more experimental.  We brought things like sse, fast math, and unrolling into the bedroom and compiled new versions of our libraries. p  pIt started out well enough.  Wed compile some code using the new libraries, test out the new waters.  Over time our performance as a couple soared.  She was working faster and I thought all was well and good.  Then things took a turn for the worse.  We brought another player into the mix.  Her name is Matlab.p  pWe started compiling for Matlab,p  precodemex CCgcc CFLAGSCFLAGS msse msse2 msse3 ffastmath ftreevectorize LDFLAGSLDFLAGS msse2 msse3 ffastmath ftreevectorize Iusrlocalinclude Lusrlocallib lsundialscvode lsundialsnvecserial v o krynew.mexmaci64 mexmain.c codepre  pcompiling and linking worked great.   But then the trouble startedp  precodekrynewparam,init,060240,abstol,rtol,1  Invalid MEXfile UsersAndrewDocumentsMATLABhetoptimkrynew.mexmaci64 dlopenUsersAndrewDocumentsMATLABhetoptimkrynew.mexmaci64, 1 Library not loaded usrlocalliblibsundialscvode.1.dylib   Referenced from UsersAndrewDocumentsMATLABhetoptimkrynew.mexmaci64   Reason Incompatible library version krynew.mexmaci64 requires version   2.0.0 or later, but libsundialscvode.1.dylib provides version 1.0.0. codepre  pMatlab felt that our experiments had gone to far.  That they were totally different versions of the libraries.  I dont know where she got this idea.  I did some investigatingp  precode otool L krynew.mexmaci64  krynew.mexmaci64     usrlocalliblibsundialscvode.1.dylib compatibility version 2.0.0, current version 2.0.0     loaderpathlibsundialsnvecserial.0.0.2.dylib compatibility version 0.0.0, current version 0.0.2     loaderpathlibmx.dylib compatibility version 0.0.0, current version 0.0.0     loaderpathlibmex.dylib compatibility version 0.0.0, current version 0.0.0     loaderpathlibmat.dylib compatibility version 0.0.0, current version 0.0.0     usrliblibstdc.6.dylib compatibility version 7.0.0, current version 7.4.0     usrliblibgccs.1.dylib compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1.0.0     usrliblibSystem.B.dylib compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 111.1.4 codepre  pThe problem was in libsundialscvode.  There was no version 2, there never was.  To make matters worse, my Macbook took Matlabs side.  I tried uninstalling, striping out all references to the new things, even deleted our make files and tried to start again.  I tried to rebuild our libraries the old way.  But they wouldnt let go of the elusive version 2.  I didnt know how to give them what they wanted.  I just wasnt man enough to meet their expectations of me.p  pThe only thing I could guess was that at some point, version 2 made sense, but that I backed away from it somehow.  I guess the link I had presented stayed in their minds even when I went back to the way it was.   I guess I forgot the first rule of that birds and the bees talk given by my sys admin, Every time you symbolink a dynamic library you give part of yourself away that you never get back.p  pIn desperation to keep both my Macbook and Matlab in my life, I told a lie that Im not proud ofp  precodesudo mv libsundialscvode.1.0.0.dylib libsundialscvode.2.0.0.dylib  codepre  pI didnt think it would work, but it did.  They compile my code now and they appear happy enough.  But I have the lingering feeling that Im just faking it, and that my lie will come back to bite me.p  pSo, since Dan Savage just ignores me, I turn to you stackoverflow for relationship advice. I need to somehow tell my Macbook that, no, version 1.0.0 is enough for us.  How can I get her to listen to me and fix the compatibility issues in my relationship without my horrible liep

Negative 34595 pImagine a gravityrotation sensor of iPhone that for each attitude of the device provides a gravity vector Vg and a current 3x3 rotation matrix M0. Such asp  precodeVg  M0  Vz Vz  Mt  Vg  where   Vg  current gravity vector   M0  current rotation matrix   Mt  inverse or actually transpose matrix of M0   Vz  negative Zaxis vector   0, 0, 1  codepre  pThere is a need to have an option to calibrate the accelometer and gyroscope by all axis that means we would like to store the reference matrix C0 for the reference gravity vector Vc at some moment of time. Sop  precodeVc  C0  Vz Vz  Ct  Vc  where   Vc  reference gravity vector   C0  reference rotation matrix   Ct  inverse or actually transpose matrix of C0   Vz  negative Zaxis vector   0, 0, 1  codepre  pNow if we will use the reference matrix as a zeroreference one then the calibrated gravity Vx or a gravity in relation to the reference one Vc is possible to be computed with the composite rotation matrix X0.

Negative 34595 pIm currently working on my Computer Engineering final year project.p  pI have to implement a VoIP and text messaging system  similar functionality to Whatsapp, with the addition of voice services consisting of clients and a server i.e. I have to develop the client software as well as the server software.p  pThe client software has to be implemented on Android and the server software has to be implemented on .NET using C and the clientserver connection will be done over WiFi. So ,basically, the setup will consist of a server app running on a PC and a wireless access point allowing the clients Android phones to connect to the server, no PSTN stuff or anything like that. Just the Android phones, a PC hosting the server and a wireless router.p  pFor now Im looking at the server development, specifically the messaging functionality. Some of the functions I will need for the messaging part server sidep  pRegister clients on the server.p  pKeep contact lists for clients.p  pkeep presence information for clients.p  pRoute messages between clients.p  pUpdate clients with presence information of other clients.p  pWhat protocols should I consider for the messaging part My research so far points to XMPP but there doesnt seem to be much out there for C specifically. Most of the stuff I saw was for Java or C, and it was mainly for client development.  The C libraries that I had a look at gloox, txmpp dont seem to be widely used. Would it be a good idea to implement my own mechanisms for the five functions listed above or should I use a standard protocol and standard libraries and if so, which ones I plan to use Visual Studio to develop the server. Thanksp

This worked until I implemented the IIS7 integrated pipeline authentication, restricting access to any static files hosted in my app.p  pI have since found out that adding this change, that the process tries to execute through the NETWORK SERVICE account instead of my impersonation token in my web.config. p  pIs there any reason for this or a way for me to force the method to use the impersonated userp  pemstrongEDITemstrongp  pOf course now Ive implemenet the integrated pipeline, the application sees the batch file as a static file and was trying to access it via the annoymous user account, which was set to application pool identity, which in turn is using NETWORK SERVICE account.p  pthe files were situated in a separate class library directory on the hard drive and not hosted through the application. I have tried to rectify this by adding them to a folder in my application, hoping that now integrated pipeline would see that the user is authenticated and allow access.

Negative 34595 pOne of the barriers that as far as I know was never removed, but perhaps Im mistaken and this was resolved a while ago to being able to have truly cross browser compatible tests  with Watir and Firewatir is that Watir was originally designed to use One based indexing, while whoever created firewatir broke with that and made it Zero based.   p  pWhile Im sure there are good historical reasons for each decision, and I dont want to debate which is right, its been a pain for testers trying to create scripts that run under each without any alteration since at the very least this affects identifying elements by index, which is sometimes something youve no choice but to do.p  pIm wondering if moving to WatirWebdriver could create a more uniform platform p  pAlso do we have any reference to the differences between the latest Watir, and WatirWebdriver   For example in a recent question here it came up that .value  is not implemented as a direct set without events alternative to .set, and basically acts just the same as .set does. p

Negative 34595 pThanks in advance for your help guys. I consider myself pretty wellversed in jQuery but as I was helping my sister with her Prototype homework, this frustrated the crap out of me. She couldnt solve it in time so thats moot but for my sanitys sake, I hope you can tell me whats going on.p  pWe were simply creating a netflixstyle queue with add, reorder and delete through AJAX.

Negative 34595 pI use codeApplicationErrorcode to handle errors in an ASP.NET MVC 3 application. Today I noticed that for one particular error case, this method is called twice When requesting a resouce with a leading underscore, as e.g. codeViewStart.cshtmlcode.p  pThe implementation of codeApplicationErrorcode consumes the last server errorp  precodevar exception  server.GetLastError server.ClearError ... codepre  pTherefore, when its called for the second time, codeGetLastErrorcode returns codenullcode. When its called for the first time, it sets a corresponding status code and content on the response object. The second invocation then caused all these settings to be overwritten. To work around this issue, I now check for a null pointerp  precodeif exception  null return codepre  pThis way, it works perfectly fine The first run of the method replaces the response by an error page and sets the status code. The second run does nothing. Then the response is sent to the client who gets the correct status code and error page.p  pBut this line of code looks like dirty to me. I would prefer to understand what is going on rather than having the error handler quit silently when in fact something must have gone wrong.p  pPlease note It seems like no exception is thrown anywhere during the first run of the error handling. Otherwise I could understand it. But when debugging it line by line, the whole codeApplicationErrorcode method is processed, including an MVC call to a controller and the rendering of the views. In fact, after following gordonmls comment and checking the Break when CLR exception is thrown flag, Visual Studio did never break, not even before the first invocation of ApplicationError.p
Negative 34595 pI have a unit test using typemock 5.4.5.0 that is testing a creation service.  The creation service is passed in a validation service in its constructor.  The validation service returns an object that has a boolean property IsValid.  In my unit test I am mocking the validation service call to return an instance that has IsValid set to true.  The creation service has an if statement that checks the value of that property.  When I run the unit test, the object returned from the validation service has its property set to true, but when the if statement is executed, it treats it as though it was false.p  pI can verify this by debugging the unit test.  The object returned by the validation service does indeed have its IsValid property set to true, but it skips the body of my if statement entirely and goes to the End If.p  pHere is a link to the unit test itself  a hrefhttpsgist.github.com1076372 relnofollowhttpsgist.github.com1076372ap  pHere is a link to the creation service function I am testing  a hrefhttpsgist.github.com1076376 relnofollowhttpsgist.github.com1076376ap  pDoes anyone know why the hell the IsValid property is true but is treated like it is falsep  pP.S. I have also entered this issue in TypeMocks support system, but I think I will probably get a quicker response herep

Suppose I have codegetimage.phpcode that returns codeimagejpegcode or codeimagepngcode as the response.p  pThe initial condition is also that I have Windows Server 2003 to test my script on and preinstalled Apache 2.2.16 with a thread model.

The maximum performance I get is 16001700 successful responses per a minute requests are produced by eight virtual users.p  pI am not a system administrator and not experienced dealing with heavy performances, so my question is can this be a problem of PHP thread safety discussed a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions681081isphpthreadsafeherea  How can I determine the problem I face Would it be better to try my script as CGI with IIS  FastCGI or we have to look at Linuxbased web serverp  pP.S.

Negative 34595 pI have a growing number of scripts that make up a program I am writing and decided it was time to clean up my source tree and package them up correctly. Im sure this is a simple question but I cant find out how to do it.p  pIf I have a group of modules, that fit together, but one should be a toplevel module and the others should be prefixed by the module name but actually go into lower level packages, how can I do it.p  pFor example say I wanted to be able to codeimport mystuffcode, and get all mystuff. but I also should be able to codeimport mystuff.test.test1code. I thought I would create a source tree like this,p  precodemyprogram     mystuff.py     mystuff         init.py         tests             init.py             test1.py             test2.py             ... codepre  pBut in this case, it seems codemystuffcode always takes precedence over codemystuff.pycode, so codeimport mystuffcode does nothing as long as codemystuffcodes codeinit.pycode is empty.p  pWhat would be the correct approach to get the desired behaviour Or is this not possible and must I move codemystuff.pycode into codemystuffcode and have to access it as codemystuff.mystuffcode  seems like unnecessary repetion.p  pSorry, if Ive just missed something obvious. I assume this must be documented somewhere, but I cant seem to find where somewhere is.p  pstrongUpdate.strong While I believe Ignacios method is the correct one, I dont really like it If I have multiple files open in my editor and theyre all called codeinit.pycode things could get messy. So, I have decided to leave my structure as it is, and link codemystuff.pycode to codemystuffinit.pycode. If anyone has any opinions on why I shouldnt be doing this, Id like to hear them. p  pemActually in the end, I am linking the other way around, since I couldnt find a way to make distutils dereference symlinks when creating a codetar.gzcode, and I ended up with broken links in my output. This way has the same effect and keeps it happy.emp

Negative 34595 pI decided to have a play with XNA for Windows Phone 7, and for my first game, I need to take an image and split it up into square sprites, so the image essentially becomes a sprite sheet. The original image will likely be too large or small for the screen, so Ive done the following to work out how to apply a scale such that it fits on the screen, but without any gaps showing so one dimension may go beyond the screen.p  precodeTexture  content.LoadltTexture2DgtassetName  var width  Texture.Bounds.Width var height  Texture.Bounds.Height  var widthDifference  width  screenWidth var heightDifference  height  screenHeight  if widthDifference lt 0  heightDifference lt 0     if widthDifference lt heightDifference       Scale  float screenWidthwidth    else       Scale  float screenHeightheight  else     if widthDifference gt heightDifference       Scale  float screenWidthwidth    else       Scale  float screenHeightheight   if Scale lt 0    Scale  Scale1 codepre  pBut next I need to generate sprites from this image that fill the screen neatly in a grid. I guess my main question is that when I call my draw method on each sprite, does the scaling apply to the original sprite sheet, or just to the sprite itself after taking its texture from the sprite sheetp  pIf its the latter, Im a little confused about how best to scale the sprite sheet before building my individual sprites. I may end up actually first resizing the image to exactly match the screen dimensions to make life easier, but this seems a little heavy handed.p  pAny suggestions would be most welcomep

Negative 34595 pI am a total php beginner. I actually want to customize a survey platform for visual stimuli for my needs as I need this for my thesis. The original version of this survey platform asks participants for their mail address to login then they see the available tests. As far as I understand it the code checks if the mail address is already saved in the database and if not reserves a certain number of the stimuli for the respective participant with the use of their mail address as identifier. This number of stimuli will then be blocked from further tests.

Negative 34595 pAt school I was often taught that preprocessor statements can easily go haywire, since the strings you define, egp  precodedefine PI 3.1415926 codepre  pare substituted every where in your code, leading to weird substitutions when a variable name contains the string codePIcode. p  pTherefore, when debugging, I steer away from the following approachp  precodedefine DEBUG ... ifdef DEBUG      debug code endif ... codepre  pbut tought it would be safer to usep  precodeconst static bool DEBUG  true int main      ...     ifDEBUG  debug code      ...  codepre  pThis works well but I was wondering what, in comparison to the preprocessor statement approach, the overhead is at runtime for this approach With the preprocessor approach everything happens embeforeem compilation,so no runtime overhead is to be expected. p  pI know that the overhead for a simple codeifcodestatement is pretty much neglectabe, yet this doesnt hold when it is put deep in to some nested loops that run for a large number of times small things add up to big things.p  pDoes the compiler recognize the fact that codeDEBUGcode is codeconst staticcode and emhardcodeem this into the executable, already enabling or disabling the debug code at compiletime What makes me suspect this is that the other day, when working in some unrelated code, the compiler warned me about some part of the code being obsolete because the codeifcodestatement surrounding it would never become true if I remember correctly.p

Negative 34595 pIve been trying to find a source code or tutorial or anything that I can work with, but so far I havent had any luck. The closest Ive come was using a hrefhttphaxic.com relnofollowhaXica, but without a way to change how the input box looks I was able to fix this in the open source files, but without being able to change the compiler, the fix wont stick in the resulting .swf, I cant achieve the desired font and color.p  pSo Im turning to Actionscript 3  Flash, as I have some knowledge of it, although mostly used for constructing websites. The goal is to create a very, very, very simple game based on traditional text adventure structure. When I say simple, I mean really simple. I dont need maps, I dont need NPCs, I dont need items, I dont even need to have a list of commands that can be accessed at any time. All I need is to display some text, accept a specific input, and then display some more text based on what that input is.p  pHeres an example of what Im trying to achieve The .swf loads up, the user sees some text imitating a POST. This isnt an actual preloader, just some fancy everything is starting up text. At the end of the animation, the user is instructed to press any key to continue, and doing so removes the existing text and loads in the next set. From there Id like to have various steps requiring certain input i.e. asking users for a username, requiring the input of username , but this doesnt actually have to store the username, just have the valid format of username name detected before continuing to the next step and either outputting additional text or wiping the existing text and simulating the start of a new program.p  pIm guessing that this mostly involves calling various functions based on input, and then changing what the expected inputs are within those functions, but I really dont have any idea where to get started. Ive also noticed in what few examples Ive seen, that input text is submitted through the use of a button. Is there any way to get this to work with just the enter key, to simulate a command consolep  pIm certainly not expecting a complete source code, just a few pointers. Any help is appreciated, thanks Im also open to suggestions other than Actionscript, however the resulting game needs to be able to run in a web browser, and some form of animation for the text is preferred.p

Negative 34595 pIf my understanding is correct, the following semantics apply to structs and classes in C, C and Dp  precode        struct          class  C     stackheap      stackheap         valuereference valuereference  C  D  stack           heap         value           reference codepre  pI.e., in C there is no semantic difference between structs and classes apart from the default public  private access. In contrast, C and D structs have value semantics and stack allocation at least by default, whereas C and D classes have reference semantics and heap allocation. p  pstrongMy question is would it be good C style to mimic this difference by using the struct keyword exclusively for all entities with value semantics, and the class keyword exclusively for all entities with reference semanticsstrong p  pIt would of course be a selfdiscipline tool not enforced by the compiler, but it could improve code readibility, especially for reviewers with C  D backgrounds. OTOH, the current idiom in C seems to be to only use the struct keyword for simple entities such as pure POD aggregates and template metafunctions only, so it could be confusing for C programmers.p

Negative 34595 pWhile working on a large list of tabular data that needs an easy sortingfiltering system, I discovered the Isotope library, which seems to do exactly what I want, and provides a lot of nice visuals and functionality. Id like to be able to sort and filter table rows using Isotope, and Ive come up with a basic demo that seems to work. However, a few bugs are presentp  ul liIm using the lttheadgt section for filters and row headers, so Im applying the Isotope selector to the lttbodygt. However, when Isotope is initialized with the tbody as a container, the table cells in each row lose the width assigned by the table formatting. This isnt a huge deal, as I can set column widths manually if I need to, but it is rather annoying in the current context.li liThe rows are placed outside the table, in the top left of the tables container element. The relative positioning on the tbody element seems to not affect the rows absolute position style rules applied automatically by Isotope as it would with a normal div. Normally, the absolute positioning would be relative to its container element if the container was positioned using either absolute or relative positioning, but this doesnt seem to be the case here.li ul  pThe table rows are being filtered properly, and the Isotope library is properly applying animations and styling with those exceptions. If at all possible, Id like to keep the use of tables, as the people maintaining this page will be doing so through a CMS, and dont know enough about HTML or the WYSIWYG editor the CMS uses to consistently produce any HTML structures beyond a fairly basic table. Does anyone have any advice on fixing these two issues Thanksp  pstrongEditstrong As an addendum, Ive solved the initial problems I was having. Turns out, the tbody element does not accept a position relative or position absolute attribute, so the table rows were not being placed properly. Setting the whole table to position relative solved the main placement issue, though the rows were then moved to the top left of the table. I solved this issue by offsetting the table row top attribute by the height of the thead element in Javascript, since without Javascript the display is normal.p  pThis works beautifully in Firefox, Chrome, Opera, and Safari. However, IE 7, 8, and 9 all have rendering issuesand worse, theyre all different rendering issues. IE9 refuses to place the table cells with the correct offset, IE8 doesnt show the rows at all, and IE7 seems to interpret the whole situation to mean EXPLODE. At least the main problem I encountered was solvedp

Negative 34595 pI was reading about private constructor and found a few points that I couldnt understand. It said, if you declare a constructor as privatep  ol liThat class cannot be explicitly instantiated from another classli liThat class cannot be inheritedli liShould be used in classes containing only static utility methods  li ol  pstrongMy first questionstrong Point code2code says the class cannot be inherited. Well, if you declare a class private then it would still satisfy this property. Is it because,  if a class is private, it can still be explicitly instantiated from outside by another classp  pstrongMy second questionstrong I dont understand point code3code. If I have a helper class which is full of static methods, I would never have to instantiate that class to use the methods. So, what is the purpose of a constructor in that class which you are never going to instantiatep

Negative 34595 pIn several places Ive seen the recommended signatures of copy and move constructors given asp  precodestruct T      T     Tconst Tamp other     TTampamp other  codepre  pWhere the copy constructor takes a const reference, and the move constructor takes a nonconst rvalue reference.p  pAs far as I can see though, this prevents me taking advantage of move semantics when returning const objects from a function, such as in the case belowp  precodeT generatet      const T t     return t  codepre  pTesting this with VC11 Beta, codeTcodes copy constructor is called, and not the move constructor. Even using codereturn stdmovetcode the copy constructor is still called.p  pI can see how this makes sense, since codetcode is const so shouldnt bind to codeTampampcode. Using codeconst Tampampcode in the move constructor signature works fine, and makes sense, but then you have the problem that because codeothercode is const, you cant null its members out if they need to be nulled out  itll only work when all members are scalars or have move constructors with the right signature.p  pIt looks like the only way to make sure the move constructor is called in the general case to have made codetcode nonconst in the first place, but I dont like doing that  consting things is good form and I wouldnt expect the client of codeTcode to know that they had to go against that form in order to increase performance.p  pSo, I guess my question is twofold first, should a move constructor take a const or nonconst rvalue reference And second am I right in this line of reasoning That I should stop returning things that are constp

Negative 34595 pI am looking to create a 6 or more band equalizer for a open source project I am working on a hrefhttpistudio.codeplex.com relnofollowiStudioa. I already implemented the SkypeFx equalizer, but it only has 3 band equalizer, but I want a more professional one. So I went onto designing few filters myself using Matlab and I designed 6 ARMA filters for a sample equalizer. I need to filter output in real time of course. So I went on with implementing a differential equation for this purpoise.p  precode    private double[] Filterfloat[] buffer, SignalFilter filter, float filterWeight, int count              double[] y  new double[buffer.Length]         for int n  0 n lt count n                      y[n]  0.0f             for int k  0 k lt filter.B.Count k                              if n  k gt 0                                      y[n]  y[n]  filter.B[k]  doublebuffer[n  k]                                            for int k  1 k lt filter.A.Count k                              if n  k gt 0                                      y[n]  y[n]  filter.A[k]  y[n  k]                                                 return y      codepre  pThis function is pretty straightforward. In buffer I am storing the real time samples, filter is a class with 2 arrays with AR and MA coefficients. The function is called by a process function, which only pass the buffer through all available filters and sum the result togetherp  precode    public void Processfloat[] buffer, int offset, int count              Listltdouble[]gt filtered  new Listltdouble[]gt          for int i  0 i lt filters.Count  5 i                      filtered.AddFilterbuffer, filters[i], Values[i], count                  for int i  0 i lt count i                      buffer[i]  0.0f             for int x  0 x lt filtered.Count x                              buffer[i]  floatfiltered[x][i]  Values[x]  1  2                            codepre  pThe code was a little shortened, but it should be enough. The equalizer somewhat works, but it has two problems, first one being the lag it creates probably needs optimization and strongthe sound distortionstrong. There are little bangs between each filtered buffer.p  pSo my question is this strongWhy is the sound distorted and how to fix itstrongp  pThanks.p
Negative 34595 pOkay so heres, the scenario I have a thumbnail that contains an artists profile picture, name and genre. The name is at the top and genre at the bottom. The size of the thumbnail needs to be limited by height as well as width. Width causes the problem as when the name is longer another line is created. This pushes down the other elements making the whole thumbnail longer. I do not want to limit the length that the artist can enter in the name so need a solution in css hopefully.p  pI need the whole thumbnail to be set at a fixed height but the image needs to be shortened to compensate for the extra lines in the name. At the moment if there is an extra line the whole thumbnail is made that extra line longer. I need the image to shorten if there is another line in the name or in other words if the content exceeds the containers width.p  pI hope there is a way to do this and I will provide css and markup if asked for but I dont see how it could help in this scenario. I have included this in the jquery topic as well as im not sure if this can just be done with css.p  pThe thumbnail I have included is the one that is causing problems.

Negative 34595 pI recently came onto a project in which we have two applications that are virtually identical. We are using Django 1.4 and Postgresql 8.4.

My only issue is that there is a lot of foreign key references.

Negative 34595 pI am having a problem, or perhaps a lack of understanding, with the jQuery execution order of code.getcode function. I want to retrieve some information from a database server to use in the code.readycode function. As you all know, when the get returns, it passes the data to a return handler that does something with the data. In my case I want to assign some values to variables declared inside the ready handler function. But the problem is, the return handler of code.getcode does not execute until after ready has exited. I was wondering if a am I doing this rightis there a better way or if b there was a way around this that is, force the get return handler to execute immediately or some other fix Im not aware of. I have a feeling this is some closure thing that Im not getting about JavaScript.p  pAs per request, Ill post an example of what I meanp  precodefunction      var userID      .geturi, functionreturnData                     var parsedData  JSON.parsereturnData                    userID  parsedData.userID                    codepre  pSo as you can see, Im declaring a variable in ready. Then using a get call to the database to retrieve the data needed. Then I parse the JSON that is returned and assign the userID to the variable declared before. Ive tested it with a couple alerts. An alert after the get shows userID as undefined but then an alert in gets return handler shows it to be assigned.p

Negative 34595 pSince it is recommended not to use codetablecode elements for layout purposes nontabular data, because the special formatting applied to those elements a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions83073whynotusetablesforlayoutinhtmlanswer84986may change in the futurea, is it also not recommended to use CSS properties such as codetextaligncode, which was designed to be used on text, for codeimgcode elements for the same semantic reasonp  pI have been looking through the w3c specifications and for instance, codelineheightcode seems to be designed for text purposes and has plenty of references in the documentation to font size, so would it be appropriate or abusive to use this property on codeimgcode elements, simply because they are displayed as codeinlinecodep  pI can understand how the W3C idea of a a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiSemanticWeb relnofollowSemantic Weba would use CSS to remove styling information from a page, leaving data exclusively in the HTML for content accessibility. But emwhere is the original rationale documentation for CSSem, and why wouldnt they use extremely abstract properties like codehorizontalaligncode from the get go, instead of unique alignments for each display type e.g. codetextalign centercode can be used on all codedisplay inlinecode elements such as codeimgcode elements p

Negative 34595 pSo I have a table that is currently in mysql, but will be transferred to a nosql system soon.  So I took out the normalization of the tables, and now there are duplicates of the data, but one of the ids changes in each row, while the rest of the data is constant.  All rows are connected through ID A.  ID B changes for each row, and the user ID is the same for all of the rows in ID A.p  pNow I need to grab 2 groups of rows using the user ID.  The number of ID Bs is variable for every group of A though, so it could have variables number of rows all grouped together by each ID A.  So far I have just been displaying one group at a time so I have been selecting based on ID A, now I need to try and grab 2 sets by the user ID...p  pI cant seem to find a way to do this...although I dont know everything about sql.  How can I do this now on mysql  and then on nosql when i move to the system in a bit  Will be happy to answer any further questions.p

Negative 34595 pI just downloaded a Spring tutorial off the internet and am trying to run it in my local workspace. To do it, I first tried to get all the dependant jars needed by the project. I tried maven build and it failed because dependant jars were missing from my local repository and those jars were also missing from the remote repositorythe one which my project usesp  pInitially, my settings.xml only has a reference to the remote repository url which is used across the organization by various projects. I cannot expect it to be uptodate with latest jars. Can I get the remote repository names of the various utility projects fore.g for Log4j, commons logging, spring jars etc. I can then put these repository urls in my setting.xml to solve my issue.p

Im trying to move such validation logic from the constructor to my methods.p  pI tried things like p  precodepublic void DoSomething      Close  codepre  por p  precodepublic void DoSomething      Application.Current.Shutdown  codepre  pBut it doesnt seem to work. Yes, both codes do close the application, but only after a fully finished constructor code.p  pcodeWhycode would I need such a thing Well, because at startup I need to check for various things, like availability of the connection and hardware, validate the user etc, and if anything fails, theres no point of executing more code.p  pTried the same principle with Winforms and WPF hence the tags, works the same.p  pstrongCan anybody provide an explanation or maybe a solutionstrong I know this is probably very basic to some of you, but please, bare with me, Im not primarily a Windows programmer, so this is kinda new for me. Websites work a bit differently... p

Negative 34595 pIm feeding in a Bitmap image to my C program to be able to perform OCR to identify the characters in the image. I can do this fairly well if the image is not rotated. One of the program requirements, however, is that the program automatically determines if the image has been rotated, and that it automatically corrects these rotations.p  pIve tried implementing a simple method where lines are traced across the image and points which contact a character are recorded, and then performing a simple linear regression on the line points. This works to an extent, although it has not proven very accurate due to curvature of characters, etc.p  pI was wondering if there was a better method to solve this problem Many thanks in advance p

Negative 34595 pIm trying to select some data from a task table, but not any subtasks which a user may have created for themselves.

These are the ones I foundp  ul liin RX there is virtual time so the scheduler effectively controls the entire network but this is not possible in TDF because every block uses different tasks and they run independentlyli liin TDF a block can retry receiving a messageresend and stuff like that but in RX its not possible.li liin rx the dataflow is serialized but in TDF this is optionalli ul  pIt would be nice to have some comprehension that is not listlike rather something that tries to derive both from a common abstract classcategory talking only about the structural differences.p

Negative 34595 pMy project is heavily using dependency injection, and Im being very careful to avoid service locator antipattern. All objects are structured using constructor injection that allow easily identifiable list of dependencies. Now Im building an object, and it has a special constant instance, which is basically staticsingleton consider example of something like Integer.MinValue. So my initial reflex was to create a static field with a static getter method, which would create the instance of the object if it wasnt previously created. The object itself has dependencies however, so Im confused on whats the best practice for instantiating this special instance.

Negative 34595 pOk so lets say I have a structure A like thatp  precodeStruct A     private String SomeText     private int SomeValue      public AString someText, int SomeValue  .. set the initial values..       public String SomeText get  return SomeText       public int SomeValue get  return SomeValue    codepre  pNow what I want to be able to do is to return that Structure A as a result of a method in a Class ABC, like thatp  precodeClass ABC     public A getStructA         creation of Struct A         return a       codepre  pI dont want any programmer using my library which will have Struct A and Class ABC and some more stuff to ever be able to create an instance of Struct A.br I want the only way for it to be created is as a return from the getStructA method. Then the values can be accessed through the appropriate getters.  p  pSo is there any way to set a restrictions like that So a Structure cant be instantiated outside of a certain class Using C, .Net4.0.  p  pThanks for your help.  p  pEDITbr To add some details on why am I trying to achieve this  p  ul liMy class ABC has some status a person can query. This status has 2 string values and then a long list of integers.li liThere never will be a need to create an objectinstance of Status by the programmer, the status can only be returned by getStatus function of the class.li liI do not want to split these 3 fields to different methods, as to obtain them I am calling Windows API pinvoke which returns similar struct with all 3 fields.li liIf I was indeed going to split it to 3 methods and not use the struct, I would have to either cache results or call the method from Windows API every time one of these 3 methods is called...li ul  pSo I can either make a public struct and programmers can instantiate it if they want, which will be useless for them as there will be no methods which can accept it as a parameter. Or I can construct the library in such a way that this struct or change it to a class if it makes things easier  can be obtained only as a return from the method.p
Negative 34595 pIm writing a almost wizard webbased project. The base architecture is an Restful service consumed by a webclient that aim to follow the HATOAS approach. Since is a not so lightweight project Im was thinking of splitting the project in three different SinglePageApplications. For you guys its a good idea If so which is the best approach for passing the parameters among the pages Eg. One page manage a resource A, you do some basic CRUD operation, then select one of them for the next step eg. analisys based on object related to resource A, so you should to pass at least the resource A id and maybe some other parameters.

Negative 34595 pI hear so much about how well an app scales but there is so much conflicting information. On the one hand every web host claims to make scaling a breeze by adding more servers when the load increases, which seems so simple. But then other services come out which claim to do the scaling of your app for you on an already autoscaled web host like heroscale on heroku. If there is a need for these services then the web hosts themselves cant have been 100 scalable. And you still hear in the news about apps that blow up overnight and end up crashing or nearly crashing and ruining all of their traffic because they didnt scale well enough. Clearly the developers of these big time apps have heard about popular scalable web hosts like heroku, so if using them was all they needed to do, then there wouldnt be a problem. But there still is one. p  pAre there any summaries, guides, ect. out there which explain why all of this happens, the current solutions, and how scalable you will really be with those solutions Where should I start lookingp

Its a long shot and Ill update again with what I find.p  pEdit2 Changing the field in the table to nvarcharmax had no effect. I also tried using output  cmd.ExecuteScalar.ToString as well, with no impact. Im trying to see if there is a max size for SqlDataReader. When I copied the value of the text from SQL Mgmt Studio, it was only 43Kb when saved in notepad. To verify this, I pulled a report with a known working ID a smaller report, and when I copied the value straight out of Visual Studio and dumped it in notepad it was around 5MB That means these big reports are probably in the 20MB range sitting in a nvarcharmax field.p  pEdit3 I rebooted everything, to include my dev IIS server, the SQL server, and my dev laptop. Now it seems to be working. This isnt the answer as to why this happened though. Im leaving this question open for explanations as to what happened, and Ill mark one of those as an answer.p  pEdit4 Having said that, I ran another test without changing a thing and the same exception has returned. Im really starting to think that this is a SQL issue. Im updating the tags on this question. I made a separate app that runs the exact same query and it runs fine. p  pEdit5 I have implemented sequential access as per one of the answers below. Everything gets read into a stream properly, but when I try to write it out to a string Im still getting the out of memory exception. Would this indicate the issue of getting a contiguous block of memory Here is how I implemented the bufferingp  precode                reader  cmd.ExecuteReaderCommandBehavior.SequentialAccess             long startIndex  0             long retval  0             int bufferSize  100             byte[] buffer  new byte[bufferSize]             MemoryStream stream  new MemoryStream             BinaryWriter writer  new BinaryWriterstream             while reader.Read                               Reset the starting byte for the new CLOB.                 startIndex  0                   Read bytes into buffer[] and retain the number of bytes returned.                 retval  reader.GetBytes0, startIndex, buffer, 0, bufferSize                   Continue while there are bytes beyond the size of the buffer.                 while retval  bufferSize                                      writer.Writebuffer                     writer.Flush                       Reposition start index to end of last buffer and fill buffer.                     startIndex  bufferSize                     retval  reader.GetBytes0, startIndex, buffer, 0, bufferSize                                   output  reader.GetString0                          reader.Close             stream.Position  0L             StreamReader sr  new StreamReaderstream             output  sr.ReadToEnd lt Exception happens here             output  new stringbuffer codepre  pEdit6 To add to this, when OOM exception happens I see the IIS worker process which holds the method that is running hit almost 700MB. This is running on IIS Express and not the full IIS on the production server. Would this have anything to do with it Also when I call Byte[] data  stream.ToArray I intermittently get the OOM as well. I think what I really need is a way to give more memory to this process, but I dont know where to configure this.p  pEdit7 I just changed my dev server from using IIS Express on my local machine to the builtin Visual Studio web server. The OOM exception is now gone. I really think it was the allocating a contiguous block of memory issue, and for whatever reason IIS Express wouldnt fork it over. Now that it is running fine, I will publish to my full blown server on 2008R2 running the regular IIS7 to see how it goes.p

I have Word2007 on my machine and it is working fine with em.docxem extension hardcoded.

Negative 34595 pI have a modal view controller lets call it the popup view controller presented over my main view controller. At some point, I need so see the main view controller behind the popup. Therefore, I set the  codemodalPresentationStylecode property to codeUIModalPresentationCurrentContextcode before presenting the popup view controller.p  pSo what happens is that when the device orientation changes while the popup view controller is modally presented, the codewillRotateToInterfaceOrientationcode and codedidRotateFromInterfaceOrientationcode methods are not called. codesupportedInterfaceOrientationscode is called amd returns the good value. The rotation is enabled, the supported orientations are correctly set. The popup conIt actually works if I change modalPresentationStyle to the default value, everything works fine, except that obviously I do not see the main view controller behind.p  pI should add that the main view controller only supports portait, while the popup above it supports all orientations.p  pOn an iOS 5.1 device, the codewillRotatecode and codedidRotatecode methods are correctly called. It is only on the iOS 6 device that they are not.p  pDid anybody encountered a similar issue or already needed to display a transparent multiorientation view controller modally above a single orientation view controllerp

Negative 34595 pwell  my goal is to write a simple console program like this p  p1. get MIDI message from MIDI Inputp  p2. modifiy message or add messagesp  p3. write message to MIDI outputp  pSince I am completely new to C and its been 15 years since I last wrote some C code, I searched a while and came across RtMidi a hrefhttpwww.music.mcgill.cagaryrtmidi relnofollowhttpwww.music.mcgill.cagaryrtmidia which I thought could help me to reach my goal.p  pI am using Xcode to do the compiling and stuff.p  pI also figured it makes sense to use a callback function.p  pThe code from RtMidi works right out of the box. I can open virtual MIDIports, and I get my MIDI messages into the callback function where it is output to the console.p  pBut now I am stuck since I havent understood the working of the callback implementation I think.p  pMy questions are p  ul lido I have to do the modifications of the MIDI message within the callback function li liif yes, how can I write to the MIDI out from the callback function li liif no  how do I get the MIDI message into my cppcode probably by passing a pointer to a userdata field li liBut then  how is my main code triggered to process the message when it arrives in the callback function li ul  pWould be great if someone could help me out here  I tried for days to get behind this for me still magic.p  pThanks a lot in advance  Mattp

Negative 34595 pI am new to stack overflow and new to 3D graphics programming.  I have been given the task of creating an app that will read in data currently I am reading from a delimited text file, but eventually will read from data arrays and to graphically display the data in 3D.  The data is x,y,z coordinates read from a 3D scanner which is scanning logs.  I need to show the 3D representation of these logs on screen, from 4 different angles.  I am reading the data into a 2dimensional Point3D array and then using it to create 3D models in a HelixViewport3D.  I use a nested for loop to check that the data points in the array are within certain x,Z bounds and if they are I need to create a triangle out of that data.  Once the entire array is passed through, I add the Model3DGroup to the children of my viewportp  precodetopModel.Content  topGroup this.mainViewport.Children.AddtopModel codepre  pIt takes about 8 seconds for this to take place and zooming,panning, rotating are very very slow with all this data on the screen around 500,000 triangles.  Are there any ways to improve performance of WPF 3D graphics  I actually dont need to be able to zoompanrotate in the finished app but it is helpful for debugging.  The final app will simply be the same model shown statically 4 different ways, from different sides.  However, I need to be able to read in the data and get the graphics to display in 15 seconds.  Any help is greatly appreciated, and I hope my question is fairly clearp  pEDIT  After doing some more digging into vertex buffering, this is what I need to do.  I am using way too many points.  If anyone can point me to some literature on doing vertexindex buffering in c, it would be greatly appreciatedp

Negative 34595 pIm building the iOS app that is to act as a client for a REST server. So far Ive been handling my all my requests in a very simple manner. Whenever I needed to make a call, Id do something likep  precode[ApiRequestManager sendApiCalldogsgetSomeDog                     withParams dogname freddo                        callbackNSDictionary result                             do something with the response data already unserialized                            comes as JSON by the ApiRequestManager static method.                       ] codepre  pAs the app grows in complexity I realize it would be much cleaner and less of an effort to test if I actually subclassed codeNSMutableURLRequestcode and made my own protocol for responses, like thisp  precodeprotocol ApiRequestDelegate ltNSObjectgt   voidapiRequestApiRequest request didSucceedWithResultNSDictionary result  optional  voidapiRequestApiRequest request didFailWithErrorNSError error  end codepre  pThis allows me to separate the code for building requests and handling their responses, among other things. It was all fine and dandy when I started to replace my old calls using the delegation pattern, but I then realized that here and there, I was doing things like thesep  precode in class Dog  voidputLeashOnDogsNSArray dogs      NSString ids   collect IDs from dogs      [ApiRequestManager sendApiCalldogsputLeash                         withParams dogids ids                            callbackNSDictionary result                                 something                           ]  codepre  pMy question is, can I somehow say this class is to have a static version of the X protocol methods and then, in the static method in which I create the delegating object that would be the ApiRequest instance just say codemyRequest.delegate  selfcode  If I cant or theres a bettercleanermore correct way to solve this, what options do I havep

Negative 34595 pI have a codeUIBarButtonItemcode. When it receives a message it cannot handle, I want it to forward that message to a particular view controller.p  pI thought I might be able to accomplish this using the bar button items codeforwardingTargetForSelectorcode method, but apparently no such property is found on objects of type codeUIBarButtonItemcode. Point of terminology Does that mean codeforwardingTargetForSelectorcode is a private property edit Wait, I think Im confused... methods with a colon at the end arent properties... so can you ever make public a method like a gettersetter to which parameters are passedp  pAnd does that mean that in order to set the value of codeforwardingTargetForSelectorcode I must do it from within the .m file of the object for which I want to set it Which would mean that I would have to subclass my UIBarButtonItemp  pAnd if so, why is this not a public property of NSObjectsp  pAnd moreover, whats the best way to achieve my forwarding goal, preferably avoiding subclassingp  padditional informationp  pIt all stems from my inclination to reuse a single action in response to various instances of an identical button being pressed. The action is currently contained in my delegate see a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions16557502howshouldiimplementidenticalrepeatedlyusedactionsHow should I implement identical, repeatedly used actionsa and varies only in that it should send a presentViewController message to the view controller that instantiated the button that sent the action. Thus, in the action, I can send a presentViewController message to codesendercode, which is an instance of the button, and I want to be able to forward that message to the view controller that created that instance of the button, which I can do if I set each buttons forwarding property immediately after it is instantiated in its respective view controller.p  pI hoped to avoid the why just to make the question shorter, but there ya go.p

Is this possible  p  pHeres how Im doing it currentlyp  precodeglobal constantValues  config  ConfigParser.ConfigParser   use ConfigParser to get values config.readfilename  for section in config.sections     if section  INT         for option in config.optionssection             constantValues[option]  config.getintsection, option     elif section  BOOL         for option in config.optionssection             constantValues[option]  config.getbooleansection, option     elif section  FLOAT         for option in config.optionssection             constantValues[option]  config.getfloatsection, option     else         for option in config.optionssection             constantValues[option]  config.getsection, option  constantValues[sampperclk]  int constantValues[fs]  constantValues[sysclk] constantValues[samppertrig]  floatconstantValues[fs]  constantValues[sysclk]  constantValues[clksperenc] codepre  pId like to calculate sampperclk and samppertrig in the config file and then use the configparser to read it in.  Something like thisp  precodesampperclk fs  sysclk codepre  pBut everything Ive read seems to say you can only interpolate with strings.  Am I missing anything p  pEDIT  Based on Paul Woolcocks answer below, and the answer to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1382871dynamicallyattachingamethodtoanexistingpythonobjectgeneratedwithswigthis questiona, I added the following wrapper classp  precodeclass myConfigParserobject     def initself, origobj         self.myobj  origobj     def getFormulaself, section, option         retString  self.getsection, option         return evalretString     def getattrself, attr         return getattrself.myobj, attr codepre  pThat did the trickp
Negative 34595 pMy problem is a little bit complicated, so please bear with me when I try to explain it .p  pI work on automatically generating several a big number DW snowFlake schemas, from a star schema input. In the other hand, i have a set of queries, that change according to the schema of course.p  pMy purpose is to calculate the cost model of each quey on each schema, knowing that i have only statistics about table sizes, row sizes, page sytem sizes, etc all the parameters needed to calculate the cost model. if there would be data, i could use the explan plan of the dbms to generate  the best plan of each query in order to calculate the cost model, and this will save me a lot of time  p  pBut unfortunately, i have no data, and i wonder if i could use the explain plan, just by setting the parameters without data, in other words, defining size of tables without data. Is it possible on Oracle, or any other DBMSp  pThanks in advance.p  pP.S  i could just ask the question  Can i set the size of tables in oracle or any other DBMS without having data, but i prefered to explain the whole problem, hoping that ill have alternative proposals.p
Negative 34595 pI know that this while loop issue is very common, and it is usually caused by a newline in a input stream. However, I wasnt able to fix my while loop, and I dont really understand why its happening in my case.p  pConsider the following examplep  precode int main      int option  1    char buffer[100]    while option  10           whileprintfEnter menu choice n, getsbuffer, option lt 0                          some code here dealing with buffer and assigning input to option...                  printfsomethingn           return 0    codepre  pIgnore the implementation of this code e.g store the input in integer instead of string, etc. as its just a simplified version of my case for while loop. What concerns me is then I have to enter the number twice before it actually goes through the loop.p  pOutputp  pEnter menu choice 1p  pEnter menu choice 1p  pAll lights are turned on Light settings 1111 1111 1111 1111p  pI am not sure why its happening in this case...Thanksp  pUPDATE Thank you for your answers.

Should I invent an HTTP status 4XX to distinguish them, or send 409 with a JSON with info other solutionsp  pThxp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pI have found this response  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma32903691171280httpstackoverflow.coma32903691171280a where Piskvor suggest to use 409 status and request header to explain the reason why it failed andor body. Which one header body both p  pWhat do you thinkp  pstrongEDIT 2strongp  pHTTP status  body with detailed error with machineparseable codes even is OK, Twitter does that a hrefhttpsdev.twitter.comdocserrorcodesresponses relnofollowhttpsdev.twitter.comdocserrorcodesresponsesa and RESPECT  .

Negative 34595 pI have been using webView delegate successfully from long time. But recently I faced strange issue with this delegate. In my current project I am trying to access my router from webview.  I am passing username and password inside URL only. Below is load request code.p  precode[self.webView loadRequest[NSURLRequest requestWithURL[NSURL URLWithStringhttpunamepassword192.168.1.1]]] codepre  pThis calls webView delegate method webViewDidFinishLoad and webViewDidStartLoad 5 times. Is it expected When I pass simple URL like google.com it works as expected. But with username and password why these delegate methods are called 5 timesp  pIf this behaviour is correct then I need to know why it calls 5 times only. The reason is, in my program  I am calling performSegueWithIdentifier in webViewDidFinishLoad method and in present form it calls segue 5 times. For workaround I can maintain count and will call performSegueWithIdentifier on 5th count only.p  pThanksp

Especially the way arguments are described and its syntax varies. p  pe.g. usage for parameters requiring flag with filenamep  precode0 f ltfilenamegt 0 [f filename] 0 [f] ltfilenamegt 0 [f] [filename] 0 [f ltfilenamegt] 0 [f] [ltfilenamegt] codepre  pe.g. usage for parameters which are optional f, g, hp  precode0 [fgh] 0 [ltoptionalgt] 0 [[fgh]] 0 [ltfghgt] 0 fgh 0 [fgh] codepre  petc.p  pThis might be a minor issue, but annoying, as the syntax is always different and sometimes it actually means something different, but you cant see it, because it doesnt follow any conventions. Whats your opinion about it, and what is the best practise to write a usage text with appropriate syntaxp

Negative 34595 pIm using SSRS 2008 R2 and building a report with Report Builder 3.0. I have 3 parameters that are all used to restrict my data from the same column, the diagnosis code. What my user needs is the ability to restrict up to three levels of potential matches. p  pFor example, they want to be able to select all diagnosis LIKE Z and have those displayed. They want to be able to select all diagnosis LIKE Z and LIKE W and have those displayed but NOT any of those that are ONLY LIKE Z. They also want to be able to select all diagnosis that are LIKE Z and LIKE W and LIKE U but NOT those that are ONLY LIKE Z or ONLY LIKE Z and LIKE W.p  pThis has proven to be extremely difficult, basically impossible in one SQL query. I tried using UNION but it was still limiting me. Currently, I have created 3 seperate datasets, DXCode1, DXCode 2 and DXCode3, each one connected to a different parameter, allowing the 2nd and 3rd parameters to be NULL. Ive got 3 rows in a table on my report to display my diagnosis information. Diagnosis Code DXCode1 row 1 shows anything LIKE Z. Diagnosis Code DXCode2 row 2 shows anything LIKE W via LOOKUP to my second dataset. Diagnosis Code DXCode3 row 3 shows anything LIKE U via LOOKUP to my third dataset. p  pI have a hidden column in each row that checks the length of my possible matches.p  precodeLENLookupFieldsChartNumber.Value, FieldsChartNumber.Value, FieldsDiagnosisCode.Value,DXCode2 codepre  pChartNumber is my unique identifier. If there a match on those in DXCode1 and DXCode2, it means theres something I want to show. I use Row Visibility to hide any rows that have a value of 0. I repeat this logic on the next row down as well.p  pThis works to do anything when they are looking for more than one type of diagnosis code. When they ONLY want diagnosis that are LIKE Z, I cant use the same logic or else it hides everything. I need something that will hide DXCode2 and DXCode3 if are NULL but will still allow me to hide DXCode1 only if it standing alone and still show my DXCode1, DXCode2 and DXCode3 if they match.p  pI hope that I have explained myself correctly and that someone can help with a solution.p

Negative 34595 pI am currently building a Windows Store App that uses cryptography. This means extensive use of the codeCryptographicBuffercode class. The app is very securitysensitive, so I would like to make sure to Zeroize any codeBuffercodes immediately after use. I am doing the same thing with codebyte[]codes when I use them.p  pTo Zeroize them, currently wed like top  ul liWrite all 1s.li liWrite a pattern. Currently using 0,1,2,...254,255,0,1...li liWrite all 0s.li ul  pThe solution I have come up with is to create an extension method for each of codeIBuffercode and codebyte[]code which will do this for me. For codebyte[]code I believe its pretty straightforwardp  precodepublic static void Zeroizethis byte[] bytes      for int i  0 i lt bytes.Length i               bytes[i]  255          for int i  0 i lt bytes.Length i              bytes[i]  bytei  255           for int i  0 i lt bytes.Length i              bytes[i]  0       codepre  pFor codeIBuffercode, its a little bit more difficult, in that you dont seem to get direct access to the codeBuffercode. Through codeSystem.Runtime.InteropServices.WindowsRuntimecode you do seem to get a few useful methods, such as codeIBuffer.CopyTocode and codeIBuffer.AsStreamcode, which give you direct access to the codeBuffercode or underlying codeStreamcode. The solution I have come up with is thisp  precodepublic static void Zeroizethis IBuffer buffer      var capacity  buffer.Capacity     byte[] toWrite  new byte[capacity]     for int i  0 i lt capacity i              toWrite[i]  255           toWrite.AsBuffer.CopyTobuffer      for int i  0 i lt capacity i              toWrite[i]  bytei  255           toWrite.AsBuffer.CopyTobuffer      for int i  0 i lt capacity i                  toWrite[i]  0           toWrite.AsBuffer.CopyTobuffer  codepre  pMy questions are thus Is there a better way to be doing this Is there any other hidden methods codeInteropServicescode isnt really advertised all that well that would make this a bit easiermore efficientmore securep  pNote I realize the Zeroization process may be overkill, but it is requested by the Owner.p
Negative 34595 pIm trying to separate a string into three variables where codeCExamplereadme.txtcode could be read as codeCExamplecode, codereadmecode, and code.txtcode for the sake of a script Im writing. It may be deployed in both Windows and Unix environments and may deal with both Windows or Unix paths, so I need to find a way that complies to both standards Ive read about several functions that achieve similar to this, but Im looking for some input on how to best handle the single string inside a function.p  pNote, Im running IronPython 2.6 in this environment, and Im not sure if that varies so greatly with standard Python 2.7 that I would need to adapt my usage.p  pEDIT Im aware of using codeos.path.splitextcode to get the extension from the filename, but finding a platformindependent way to get both the path and the filename which I later use codesplitextcode on is what boggles me.p

Negative 34595 pIm writing a webpage that uses an image map. The image and map are loaded dynamically. If I click on the area element new content is loaded.

Negative 34595 pI cannot seem to draw a smooth curve over a bar chart in the same chart.

Issues seem to bep  p1 Points that are in the LineSeries but not in the ColumnSeries always appear at the end in the chart even if the X values are in between those that exist in the ColumnSeries. I was thinking these in between values could be used to make the LineSeries curve smooth.p  p2 The LineSeries also controls the spacing between X values. All I want is the LineSeries to be used to draw the smooth curve between the bars. As it is, having many points in the LineSeries makes the bars very thin where they should be thick.

Negative 34595 pI have a problem with Jenkins, I have a Job with around 30 steps calling maven. I have a slave machine running this job and the problem is that sometimes that slave machine disconnects and Jenkins stop working. My question is, is any way to say Jenkins to continue with the next step in list in case of any connection error By the way I have think about to place each maven call in a separate job, but I would like to know if is possible what I am asking. Thank you very much in advance.p

Negative 34595 pI am working with a blind student. She can run gdb from the command line to debug a windowbased program, but the program takes the focus from gdb, so if a breakpoint is hit or the program crashes, the screen reader does not read the gdb result. Ideally, it would like if the focus would go to the terminal when it gets gdb output, but otherwise, is there a way to run a linux command when gdb hits a breakpoint or when the program crashes Then I could run espeak gdb and she would know that gdb needs to get focus. p  pSeems there should be an easy way to do this using scripting in .gdbinit.p  pEdited laterp  pI figure out that you can put this code into .gdbinitp  precodepython import os def stophandler event os.systemespeak gdb  gdb.events.stop.connect stophandler codepre

One solution is to do the followingp  precodedivcontentRight  height 900px float left margin 0 0  15px  0 15px border 1px solid black padding 15px width 268px background ccc  codepre  pso that now the right column has no right margin, but the visual result is the same. Now, when I zoom out, the rightmost column does not fall down, but its right margin is so small compared to the others, so really, there is still a small problem.p  h2strongEdit 2strongh2  pOK, Ive done some more searching and found an even better solution. The solution consists in having the margins in between the div column elements the same and having the left and right margin adjust automatically. In order to achieve this, I had to do away with floats, and use display inlineblock which IMHO is much more suitable than floats and was designed for the purpose at handp  precodedivmainContent  padding 15px 0 width 960px textalign center   divcontentLeft  display inlineblock verticalalign top height 900px margin 0 0 0 015px border 1px solid black padding 15px width 268px background ccc   divcontentCenter  display inlineblock verticalalign top height 900px margin 0 0 0 15px border 1px solid transparent padding 15px width 268px background E00   divcontentRight  display inlineblock verticalalign top height 900px margin 0 0 15px  0 15px border 1px solid black padding 15px width 268px background ccc  codepre  pdivmainContent section  textalign justify p  pNow, at a normal zoom level all left margins will be 15px plus the last elements right margin which will also be 15px. On the other hand, if I zoom out, there is some pixel rounding going on, but the rounding is applied more or less equally on both sides, which is somewhat better. This works in Firefox.p  h2strongEdit 3strongh2  pAlas, Ive tried reducing the inbetween margins a bit, which makes the problem go away with Chrome, but one of the div elements still drops down in IE10.p  precodedivmainContent  padding 15px 0 textalign center   divcontentLeft  display inlineblock verticalalign top height 900px margin 0 0 0 0 20px increased from 15px  border 1px solid black padding 15px width 268px background ccc overflow hidden   divcontentCenter  display inlineblock verticalalign top height 900px margin 0 0 0 10px reduced from 15px  border 1px solid transparent padding 15px width 268px background E00 overflow hidden   divcontentRight  display inlineblock verticalalign top height 900px margin 0 0 20px increased from 15px  0 10px reduced from 15px  border 1px solid black padding 15px width 268px background ccc overflow hidden   divmainContent section  textalign justify  codepre  h2strongEdit 4strongh2  pIve come up with a solution which works in Firefox, Chrome, and IE10. Basically, Ive created three div wrappers around the three columns and taken measurements again ensuring all measurements are symmetric.

Negative 34595 pI have a class named bankaccount. I have an array of Bankaccount objects 02 so 3 to be exact. Bankaccount is a super class. I have two other class Checking and Savings that extend from Bankaccount. I have two fields in Checking and savings. One is an ID and the other is the balance of that account thats supposed to correspond to that ID. I also have a main class called assignment 1. Heres my question. I was told yesterday that I could get the id of an account by checking the arrays like so arBankaccount[i].getId This doesnt work because the getter setter method of checking and savings are located in the checking and savings class not the superclass bankaccount. Im confused on how to get around this. I need to check through the arrays and find out which ID is located at what reference in the array. Inheritance is new to me so sorry if this question was very dumb.p

Negative 34595 pI inherited an android app that has some securityrelated code that emseemsem to basically be a noop and that Id like to remove.  However, Im concerned that my assessment of it as a noop may be incorrect.  The app subclasses Application and, in its onCreate method, gets the serial number of the certificate that the app was signed withp  precodeByteArrayInputStream bais  new ByteArrayInputStreamcontext.getPackageManager.getPackageInfocontext.getPackageName, PackageManager.GETSIGNATURES.signatures[0].toByteArray  X509Certificate cert  CertificateFactory.getInstanceX509.generateCertificatebais  BigInteger sn  cert.getSerialNumber codepre  pIt then computes a hash of this value and compares it to an expected value thats embedded in a Java class as a byte[].  If the hashes dont match it throws an exception, crashing the app.p  pWhat this seems to prevent is someone stealing our source code, building the app and signing it themselves, then trying to install and run it.  However, if someone has the source, they can simply remove the check at app launch.  Or change the embedded hash value to match the serial number of their certificate.p  pIs that accurate  Or is there some reason Im missing that this code is usefulp

Negative 34595 pThis was my first crack at making a PUT request, after making a successful GET I was excited then following a tutorial I get an error that I dont quite understand.p  pHere is the errorp  pcodeerrortypeErrorException,messageUndefined property SymfonyComponentHttpFoundationParameterBagname,fileCwampwwwbasketballappframeworkappcontrollersPlayersController.php,line67codep  pI get that its on line code67code and the property is obviously undefined, but I followed the tutorial and I am not sure how else to write this, or why its not working like the tutorial. I feel it could be because of modrewrite, I had an issue with that, and had to set some things in the apache config file just to make the GET request, so possibly I need to change some things to make the PUT.p  pHere is the code to PUT data.p  precodepublic function updateid      input  Inputjson     player  Playerfindid     playergtname  inputgtname  this is line 67     playergtsave  codepre  pagain the error occours with codeplayergtname  inputgtnamecodep  pIn my show method when I send a GETp  precodepublic function showid      return Playerfindid  codepre  pcodePlayerfindidcode obviously worksp  pso the codeplayercode variable inside my update shouldnt be causing an issue in accessing the codenamecode attribute, so I am at a loss and hoping someone can help this noob out.p  pThanks.p
Negative 34595 pI thought I reasonably understood the use of packages but am experiencing an ostensibly trivial issue when attempting to use a method from an imported package. p  pI have three files in the following directory structurep  ul liTester.javali liapproach1Approach.javali liapproach2Approach.javali ul  pTheir code is as followsp  pstrongTester.javastrongp  precodeimport approach1.Approach  public class Tester       public static void mainString[] args              approach1.Approach.sharedMethodTEXT          sharedMethodTEXT       codepre  pstrongapproach1Approach.javastrongp  precodepackage approach1   public class Approach       public static void sharedMethodString approachText              System.out.printlnApproach Text   approachText       codepre  pstrongapproach2Approach.javastrongp  precodepackage approach2  public class Approach       public static void sharedMethodString approachText     codepre  pAs you can likely guess, Im trying to elicit different responses from the different approaches based on what packageclass is imported. The problem I encounter is within strongTester.javastrong. The first, explicit line works fine whereas the second, imported line sharedMethodTEXT throws an error of emThe method sharedMethodString is undefined for the type Testerem. I dont understand as I have imported one of the packages, so the method should be visible.p  pAny clarification would be appreicated as Im a Java newb. Thanksp
Negative 34595 pI am interested in copying the content of a file to a multidimensional List in Python. p  pThe file goes like p  precodeb,30.83,0,u,g,w,v,1.25,t,t,01,f,g,00202,0, a,58.67,4.46,u,g,q,h,3.04,t,t,06,f,g,00043,560, a,24.50,0.5,u,g,q,h,1.5,t,f,0,f,g,00280,824, b,27.83,1.54,u,g,w,v,3.75,t,t,05,t,g,00100,3, b,20.17,5.625,u,g,w,v,1.71,t,f,0,f,s,00120,0, b,32.08,4,u,g,m,v,2.5,t,f,0,t,g,00360,0, codepre  pWhat I want here is to separate the values with commas code,code and newline codencode, for jumping to the next dimension ... for example p  precodex[0][0]b, x[0][1]30.83, x[1][0]a ....  codepre  pIs there some suggestions I tried to use codecsvcode, but its too complicated for me to access the values later.

Negative 34595 pI have a Rails app that searches a static set of documents, and I need to figure out the best way to cache result sets.  I cant just use the native ActiveRecord caching.p  pstrongMy situationstrongp  pIm using the willpaginate gem, and at the moment, the query is running every time the user changes pages.  Some queries are too complex for this to be responsive, so I need to cache the results, at least during an individual session.  Also, the user may have multiple tabs open, running separate queries simultaneously.  The document set is static the size of the set is on the order of tens of thousands of documents.p  pstrongWhy straightforward ActiveRecord caching wont workstrongp  pThe user can search the contents of the documents, or search based on metadata restrictions like a date range, or both.  The metadata for each document is stored in an ActiveRecord, so those criteria are applied with an ActiveRecord query.p  pBut if they add a search term for the document content, I run that search using a separate FastCGI application, because Im doing some specialized search logic.  So, I pass the term amp the winnoweddown document list to the FastCGI application, which responds with the final result list.  Then I do another ActiveRecord query whereid IN ,returnedIdsp  pBy the way, its these FastCGI searches that are sometimes complex enough to be unresponsive.p  pstrongMy thoughtsstrongp  pTheres the obvioustoanewbie approach I can use the metadata restrictions plus the search term as a key theyre already stored in a hash.  Theyd be paired up with the returnedIds array.  And a hrefhttpguides.rubyonrails.orgcachingwithrails.htmlcachestores relnofollowthis guide at RubyOnRails.orga mentions the cache stores that are available.  But its not clear to me which store is best, and Im also assuming theres a gem thats better for this.p  pI found the gem memcached, but its not clear to me whether it would work for caching the results of my FastCGI request.p

Negative 34595 pIm working in Unity3D, C specifically, and Im trying to write a For loop that instantiates multiple game objects in 1 loop, but I want to stagger their instantiate just slightly, say 0.5 seconds, before the next game object is instantiated.p  pI figured it would be as simple as doing a normal loopp  precodefor int i  0 i lt 3 i                              InstantiategameObject, objectSpawn[i].transform.position, Quaternion.identity                 StartCoroutineWeaponsCooldown6                          StartCoroutineWeaponsCooldown2 codepre  pand in my couroutine i have a switch case so i can reuse it multiple times think multiple hard points on a ship or somethingp  precodeIEnumerator WeaponsCooldownint coolTrigger      switch coolTrigger          case 1         mainFire  true         yield return new WaitForSeconds5         mainFire  false         break      case 2         leftFire  true         yield return new WaitForSeconds3         leftFire  false         break ...down to case 6 for this project codepre  pThe results that Im getting are thus The StartCoroutine that is outside the for loop fires just fine  this is the master cooldown for that weapon and keeps the player from spam firing it. However, the startcoroutine inside the for loop does not seem to slow the for loop down any and Im so new to Unity3D scripting and C Im not entirely sure how to troubelshoot this.p  pIm assuming that StartCoroutine is a seperate thread that runs aside from the Update thread and thats why the For loop is continuing, because it isnt waiting for the coroutine to finish.p  pIf that is the case, would anyone have any ideas other than putting individual scripts on each hard point of the player and setting staggering start times or game object instantiate delays on each onep  pThe main reason I wanted to do it all in 1 script is that the player could have upwards of 25 hard points and this would make it a lot easier to reuse on multiple ships with fewer hard points and easier to manage for me personally later on.p  pThank you all for any insight offered in advance, Nick Willcoxp

Negative 34595 pI was under the impression that in MySQL, GROUP BY supported the use of column names or column alias.p  pI have some fairly simple SQL which is doing a cross join between 2 tables and then a left join to get some matching data if it exists, and concatenating up matching data. This was giving strange results. Finally realised that the problem appears to be my use of alias names rather than the actual column names.p  pWith alias names it seems to have treated those lines rows with a non matched row on the left join differently.

Negative 34595 pIm developing an application which requires heavy image processing using camera input and realtime results display. Ive decided to use OpenGL and OpenCV along with Androids normal camera API. So far it has become a bit of a multithreading nightmare, and unfortunately I feel very restricted by the lack of documentation on the onPreviewFrame callback.p  pI am aware from the documentation that onPreviewFrame is called on the thread which acquires the camera using Camera.open. What confuses me is how this callback is scheduled  it seems to be at a fixed framerate. My current architecture relies on the onPreviewFrame callback to initiate the image processingdisplay cycle, and it seems to go into deadlock when I block the camera callback thread for too long, so I suspect that the callback is inflexible when it comes to scheduling. Id like to slow down the framerate to test this, but my device doesnt support this.p  pI started with the code over at a hrefhttpmaninara.blogspot.ca201209rendercamerapreviewusingopengles.html relnofollowhttpmaninara.blogspot.ca201209rendercamerapreviewusingopengles.htmla. This code is not very parallel, and it is only meant to display exactly the data which the camera returns. For my needs, I adapted the code to draw bitmaps, and I use a dedicated thread to buffer the camera data to another dedicated heavylifting image processing thread all outside of the OpenGL thread.p  pHere is my code simplifiedp  pstrongCameraSurfaceRenderer.javastrongp  precodeclass CameraSurfaceRenderer implements GLSurfaceView.Renderer, SurfaceTexture.OnFrameAvailableListener,     Camera.PreviewCallback   static int[]                surfaceTexPtr  static CameraSurfaceView    cameraSurfaceView static FloatBuffer          pVertex static FloatBuffer          pTexCoord static int                  hProgramPointer  static Camera               camera static SurfaceTexture       surfaceTexture  static Bitmap               procBitmap static int[]                procBitmapPtr  static boolean              updateSurfaceTex  false  static ConditionVariable    previewFrameLock static ConditionVariable    bitmapDrawLock   MarkerFinder extends CameraImgProc static MarkerFinder         markerFinder  new MarkerFinder static Thread               previewCallbackThread  static      previewFrameLock  new ConditionVariable     previewFrameLock.open      bitmapDrawLock  new ConditionVariable     bitmapDrawLock.open   CameraSurfaceRendererContext context, CameraSurfaceView view      rendererContext  context     cameraSurfaceView  view         Load pVertex and pTexCoord vertex buffers   public void close         This code usually doesnt have the chance to get called   Override public void onSurfaceCreatedGL10 unused, EGLConfig config   ..

The original version is here a hrefhttpwww.gmarwaha.comjqueryjcarousellite relnofollowhttpwww.gmarwaha.comjqueryjcarouselliteap  pThere is another version of jCarouselLite that has touch swipe enabled by default, but I cant use it because of the magento customisation of the script is very extensive.p  pHere is the script I am using to integrate touchSwipe and jCarouselLitep  precodejQuery.noConflict function        jQuerywindow.bindload,function             jQueryjmcontain15540477707383105391393986408.jCarouselLite             auto 0,             speed          500,             visible        4,             btnNext jmmainwrapjmcontain15540477707383105391393986408 .jmnext,             btnPrev jmmainwrapjmcontain15540477707383105391393986408 .jmprev,             width 740,             widthimg 175,             scroll 1                        jQueryul.jmsliderul.jmquickview          var carousel  jQueryjmcontain15540477707383105391393986408          carousel.swipe             swipeLeft functionevent, direction                     carousel.jCarouselLitego, 1             ,             swipeRight functionevent, direction                  carousel.jCarouselLitego, 1                                 jQuery codepre  pI got the code for integration here a hrefhttpwww.tommaton.co.ukblog2013februaryjcarouselwithswipegesturesusingtouchswipe relnofollowhttpwww.tommaton.co.ukblog2013februaryjcarouselwithswipegesturesusingtouchswipeap  pAll I really want to do is activate prev and next with left and right swipe.p  pI also used this variation of the codep  precodecarousel.swipe     swipeLeft functionevent, direction             carousel.jCarouselLite.next     ,     swipeRight functionevent, direction          carousel.jCarouselLite.prev           codepre  pAnd this variationp  precodecarousel.swipe     swipeLeft functionevent, direction             carousel.jCarouselLitenext     ,     swipeRight functionevent, direction          carousel.jCarouselLiteprev           codepre  pBut I am still getting the same behaviour as the previous code. It is swapping between the first two items. If I use navigation to go to a 3rd item and then swipe, it goes back to one of the first two items.p  pThe next issue I am having is that the area that is swippable is small. It seems like other elements, images and links, are stopping touchSwipe from registering a swipe.p  pDoes anyone have any ideasp

Negative 34595 pI have a value stored in a codeshort intcode that only makes sense when represented as hexadecimal digits with a decimal point. To exemplify if the codeshort intcode contains 1132 decimal 534h, then I need to output 5.34. The value comes from a function hidden in a shared library from a company, so I have to accept what Im given. The result emdoes not need to be a number typeem int or float rather, it can be of any type e.g. string that I can feed into the standard output stream.p  pThe given value in the codeshort intcode will always be such that when represented as hexadecimal digits, all digits will be in the range 09 never AF. There should always be two decimal places.p  pI know I can represent the decimal digits as hex digits with codestdhexcode and output 534 with codestdoutcode, but I dont know how to store those individual digits 5, 3, 4 in memory so I can insert a code.code in them.p  pOnce I emdoem get the hex digits, should I convert the set of hex digits to a string and place the decimal point three characters from the right Or would it be easier to somehow convert to a floating point format and divide by 100 64hp

Negative 34595 pstrongQuestionstrongp  pIs there any way that I could set IBOutlet properties programmatically and in an automated way i.e. without hardcoding the properties to be set Maybe there is some IBOutlet setting routine that I could intercept with my own specialized codep  pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pThe problem leading to the question above originates from the fact that IBOutleted size constraints width and height are not being set when running the following method its a method for replacing a placeholder view from IB with the real viewp  precode UIView replaceWithNibViewIfPlaceholderUIViewview       BOOL isPlaceholder  [[view subviews] count]  0       Special treatment for buttons which contain their title label, and thus      always have one subview     if [view isKindOfClass[UIButton class]] ampamp [[view subviews] count]  1           isPlaceholder  [[[view subviews] firstObject] isKindOfClass[UILabel class]]           if isPlaceholder            Were assuming that there only is one root view, and that it is of the correct type         UIView replacer  [[view class] loadFromNib]           We dont need to set the frame nor autoresizingMask as were utilizing auto layout.          replacer.tag  view.tag         replacer.alpha  view.alpha         replacer.hidden  view.hidden           Copy intrinsic constraints i.e. size constraints, which are only associated with the view itself         [[view constraints] enumerateObjectsUsingBlockNSLayoutConstraint constraint, NSUInteger idx, BOOL stop                If the constraint is not a size constraint, continue loop             if constraint.firstAttribute  NSLayoutAttributeWidth ampamp                  constraint.firstAttribute  NSLayoutAttributeHeight ampamp                  constraint.firstAttribute  NSLayoutAttributeNotAnAttribute                  constraint.secondAttribute  NSLayoutAttributeWidth ampamp                  constraint.secondAttribute  NSLayoutAttributeHeight ampamp                  constraint.secondAttribute  NSLayoutAttributeNotAnAttribute                 return              NSLayoutConstraint constraintClone  [NSLayoutConstraint constraintWithItemreplacer attributeconstraint.firstAttribute relatedByconstraint.relation toItemnil attributeconstraint.secondAttribute multiplierconstraint.multiplier constantconstraint.constant]               Now add the width or height constraint             [replacer addConstraintconstraintClone]         ]          return replacer           return view  codepre  pThis method is called from UIViewawakeAfterUsingCoderNSCodercoder. It has been tested with a lot of different Nibs and has so far worked perfectly well. The problem now, though, is that I have to recreate those constraints that are strictly related to the view being replaced, i.e. width and height constraints that are related to superview are seamlessly transferred. I have an IBOutlet for one such constraint, and it remains nil when going through this method.p  pTo clarify, the codep  precode[replacer addConstraintconstraintClone] codepre  pworks fine, the constraint is added and applied. However, the corresponding IBOutlet is not set remains nil.p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pSashas answer was correct, but the approach of intercepting IBOutlet assignments didnt solve the issue for me.p  pAs Sasha pointed out, my background section is quite unclear. Thus I will make a quick attempt explain it in a different way.p  pI use to store more or less complex views in Nib files. In order to seamlessly insert those in storyboard or other nib files, I have implemented a NibLoadedView class, which basically replaces whatever instance comes from initWithCoder by the complex view. In other words, I can set the custom type of a simple placeholder UIView in storyboardIB, and that will load the realcomplex view in its place when the app runs. All constraints applied to that placeholder view are supposed to move to the real view. And they did, at least all constraints that expressed a relation between the placeholder and its surroundings other views. Size constraints, on the other hand, are stored in the placeholder view, and will get lost if not transferred to the real view. And it was this transfer that I had problems with, because once I copied the constraints, they were applied as expected, but if I referenced one of them as an IBOutlet, that IBOutlet would turn nil it was pointing to the constraint related to the placeholder view, and once that view with all of its constraints was removed, the weak IBOutlet turned nil a strong IBOutlet would not change anything either, it would just hold the wrong constraint instead of being nil.p  pThe solution was to replacep  precode[replacer addConstraintconstraintClone] codepre  pwithp  precodememcpybridge voidconstraint, bridge const voidconstraintClone, mallocsizebridge const void constraint  [replacer addConstraintconstraint] codepre  pThis overwrites the constraint at its place in memory with the constraintClone, that way implicitly updating the IBOutlet, wherever and however it is set.p

Negative 34595 pIn my email I have a html table. Table width is set to 900px.  I need to support initial text format set by user only line breaks.

But the problem is that some lines are very long and dont have breaks. In this case all email clients automatically breaks lines so table width is not changed.

Negative 34595 pSo I would like to say I understand JavaScript fairly well, but it seems that the language always likes to throw a wrench at me.  I have a problem well maybe not problem, but for sure confusion on the behavior of instance variables for JS objects.  Lets take a look at the following codep  precodefunction Aa      this.a  a       this.b  []  function Ba     A.applythis, arguments     this.a  a  B.prototype  new A B.prototype.constructor  B B.prototype.append  functionb      this.b.pushb     var one  new Bone var two  new Btwo console.logone.a console.logtwo.a one.append10 console.logone.b console.logtwo.b codepre  pIf you run this code, you will see that codeone.bcode and codetwo.bcode have shared the same codebcode instance variable array.  I have only noticed this happening on arrays.  I understand that if this was codeA.prototype.b  []code, that it would definitely be shared across all instances of codeAcode or its children.  What I dont understand is that it is defined with this command, which means it should be per instance.  The interesting thing is that if you uncomment the codeA.applythis, argumentscode effectively calling super on the parent and remove codethis.a  acode inside the codeBcode constructor, it works as you think it would.  Would anyone know the reason why this is happeningp

Naturally I am using the following to select the file to be uploadedp  precode   ltinput typefile idfileToUpload namefile gt codepre  pUsing this current method I have to submit the file twice before the correct file path is stored, and has the side effect of showing the file path that I am storing in the database.p  pIm sure there must be a simpler way of accomplishing this using an htlm helper that I am not aware of.p

Negative 34595 pIve been messing around with this problem for about an hour now.p  pI have a viewport which supports panning and zooming, the panning is handled by storing an offset for the X and Y axis. The zoom is just a float going from 0.2 to 14.p  pMy problem is that I need to be able to place stuff where the user clicks in the viewport but when I zoom and pan the mouse coordinates are not correct.

Negative 34595 pI have 2 combo boxes on a winform, both dragged onto the surface via the designer, both get their items from a database both connect to the dbase fine and are populated properly. But one of them, when it has focus, the selected item is not visible all that can be seen is the blue background highlight. I have compared the properties of both and cannot discern any setting that is different and that might cause this. When the combobox loses focus the selected item is show, black foreground on a white background as would be expected. p

I came across a hrefhttpjavatroops.blogspot.ca201212sortverylargetextfileonlimited.html relnofollowhttpjavatroops.blogspot.ca201212sortverylargetextfileonlimited.htmla and I had some questions about it. Sorry I am unsure on the exact rules on linking blogs and what not.p  pI understand the basis of external sorting where I am breaking down the file into temporary files and then performing a merge sort on the number of temporary files. However, this method would stress the IO wouldnt it because of all the files I could limit the number of files opened at one time by doing multiple passes of nway merge, but I wished to find improvements.p  pSo reading that blog post above, I understand the idea behind the Solution 2, less so Solution 3 but I do not understand its implementation in Java. In the middle of both solutions, after the file has been split into temporary files, all the files are read into BufferedReaders mini question about bufferedreaders and filereaders is it just that it adds buffering and makes IO faster but doesnt change usability from a programmers perspective and then mapped. Does this process of mapping not take up memory I am confused on how inserting into a TreeSet would take up memory but putting into a TreeMap wouldnt. How does Solution 3 work exactlyp

Negative 34595 pAccording to Bouncy Castle documentation, there are three implementations of codeKeyStorecodep  blockquote   pThe Bouncy Castle package has three implementation of a keystore.p      pThe first BKS is a keystore that will work with the keytool in the   same fashion as the Sun JKS keystore. The keystore is resistent to   tampering but not inspection.p      pstrong The second, Keystore.BouncyCastle, or Keystore.UBER will only work   with the keytool if the password is provided on the command line, as   the entire keystore is encrypted with a PBE based on SHA1 and Twofish.   PBEWithSHAAndTwofishCBC. This makes the entire keystore resistant to   tampering and inspection, and forces verification. The Sun JDK   provided keytool will attempt to load a keystore even if no password   is given, this is impossible for this version. One might wonder about   going to all this trouble and then having the password on the command   line New keytool anyone.strongp      pIn the first case, the keys are encrypted with 3KeyTripleDES.p      pThe third is a PKCS12 compatible keystore. PKCS12 provides a slightly   different situation from the regular key store, the keystore password   is currently the only password used for storing keys. Otherwise it   supports all the functionality required for it to be used with the   keytool. In some situations other libraries always expect to be   dealing with Sun certificates, if this is the case use PKCS12DEF, and   the certificates produced by the key store will be made using the   default provider. In the default case PKCS12 uses 3DES for key   protection and 40 bit RC2 for protecting the certificates. It is also   possible to use 3DES for both by using PKCS123DES3DES or   PKCS12DEF3DES3DES as the KeyStore type.p blockquote  pI cant find any interesting information about this on Internet, it seems like nobody uses it. p  pIs is possible to use Keystore.BouncyCastle or Keystore.UBER on Android How to get instance codeKeyStore.getInstanceUBER,BCcode  Does it work well with all android versions p

Negative 34595 pIm working through possible architectures for a problem. In as few words as possible, the problem is I need to design a system that allows clients to connect using HTTPREST to kick off long running processes. Each process will create a persistent connection to a third party server and write the received data to a queue. Each process will terminate only if the third party server closes the connection or another HTTPREST request is received indicating it should be terminated.p  pstrongConstraints and backgroundstrongp  ul liClients must be able to connect using HTTPRESTli liSystem must be written in Pythonli ul  pIm a lower level C guy with enough Python experience to feel competent but trying to wrap my head around the Python frameworks available for making this easier.

I want to leverage as many frameworks and libraries for Python as possible. Performance is not a top priority.p  pstrongApproaches Ive consideredstrongp  ul lipIn doing research, I came across strongTwistedstrong which might be a fit and seems to make sense to me thinking about this as a daemon.

Im familiar with threading, though admittedly havent done anything in Python with them yet. In a nutshell, strongTwistedstrong a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5458631whatssocoolabouttwistedlooks very coola, though in the end, Im left wondering if Im overcomplicating this.pli lipThe second approach I considered is using strongCelery and Flaskstrong and simply let Celery handle all the dispatching, thread management, etc. I found this article showing a hrefhttpflask.pocoo.orgdocs0.10patternscelery relnofollowCelery and Flaska playing nicely together.

Negative 34595 pI have kind of fundamental question about scalars in Perl. Everything I read says scalars hold one valuep  blockquote   pA scalar may contain one single value in any of three different   flavors a number, a string, or a reference.

Negative 34595 pI have a map which pulls in GeoJSON polygons and points. p  pI represent these using the standard Leaflet methods to create SVG and html markers respectively. p  pTo get an idea a hrefhttpi.imgur.comGSJSZIc.jpg relnofollowhttpi.imgur.comGSJSZIc.jpgap  pSVG  blue, markers  green. p  pLeaflet creates panes, div.leafletoverlaypane for the SVG, and div.leafletmarkerpane for markers. The leafletmarkerpane bordered in red covers half the viewport and has a higher zindex then the leafletoverlaypane, thereby making the SVG polys under it unclickable. p  pIf I set the zindex of the overlay pane to be less than the marker pane, all the markers are unclickable as the overlay pane covers the whole view port.p  pIve read some things in the Leaflet Github issues about createPane, but so far havent seen it working. Shouldwill this be something which fixes this problem ie, puy all markers and SVG polys in the same panediv.p  pFor the time being Ive set the marker pane to be 1px x 1px. This seems to work fine, leading me to ask, why would the marker pane ever be set to half the viewport sizep

Negative 34595 pI am using Auto Layout. I have a UIButton with a fixed height and width and a background image a rounded square. It displays text strings of variable length between 1 and 30 words, lets say.p  pI wanted to make the text autoshrink depending on string length, and to have up to 3 lines of text in my button. So I did thisp  precode [button.titleLabel setMinimumScaleFactor0.01]     [button.titleLabel setAdjustsFontSizeToFitWidth YES]     [button.titleLabel setNumberOfLines3]     [button.titleLabel setTextAlignmentNSTextAlignmentCenter] codepre  pI also set the font size to a high value like 50 in the Interface Builder.

It does that for midlength strings but not for huge strings and I have no idea why. I have tried to add insets to my button but it doesnt do much, only moves the overlybig text around, so I assume the font adjustment is calculated prior to the incorporation of insets. p  pBelow a screenshot.

Negative 34595 pI want to reuse an existing, transactional,paginated service class, which retrieves the items using JPA from a database, inside a Spring batch job, as a reader. I want to do that instead of using directly the JpaPagingItemReader basically because the JPA query is more complex to build and the service already provides this functionality. p  pMy question would be what are the things I should take into account when developing the Spring batch adapter over this service. Although the reference documentation a hrefhttpdocs.spring.iospringbatchtrunkreferencehtmlreadersAndWriters.htmlpagingItemReaders relnofollowhttpdocs.spring.iospringbatchtrunkreferencehtmlreadersAndWriters.htmlpagingItemReadersa has a section on reusing existing services, it doesnt say anything regarding the constraints, if there are any, of using such a transactional service.p  pNow, I looked at the JpaPagingItemReader as an example for building the reader, and I came up with a couple of questions I couldnt find answers for netiher in the documentation or on stackoverflow, although this post a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma265498314473261httpstackoverflow.coma265498314473261a helped. p  pThe first thing I noticed is that a new transaction is used by the JpaPagingItemReader for reading a page of data. The above post says that this new transaction is needed so that features like retry and skip can be correctly performed.. I have also found this article related to the matter a hrefhttpsblog.codecentric.deen201203transactionsinspringbatchpart3skipandretry relnofollowhttpsblog.codecentric.deen201203transactionsinspringbatchpart3skipandretrya that says that when a skippable exception occurs during reading, we just increase the skip count and keep the exception for a later call on the onSkipInRead method of the SkipListener, if configured. Theres no rollback. So I assume that the reader has to do any reading of the records in a new transaction so that if a rollback of the transaction started when the processing of the chunk began happened, then the reader is not affected. I am wondering if this is true and if in this case my adapter should create a new transaction, invoke the service inside that transaction and then commit the transaction, similarly to how the JpaPagingItemReader does it. If thats true though, I wonder why there isnt any template provided by the framework which creates the transaction, delegates to the service the actual call to retrieve the data and then commits the transaction.p  pGreetings, Cristip

Negative 34595 pI have 8 main views and in each main view i am creating 2, 3 subview also every main view has a method deleteChildViews for deleting its child views which is called before the main view is removed.p  pNow if user frequently switches from one main view to another then for each main view its deleteChildViews method is called.p  pPROBLEMp  psince each child subview has require in it for AMD, it takes some time to initialize and return its object. for this mean time the variable in which view is assigned will be undefined.p  pEvery time we shift from one main view to another, deleteChildViews of the loaded view is called for child view cleanup and after which new view is initiated. Due to frequent shift from one main view to another, when the deleteChildViews method is called from parentmain view, its child views are found to be undefined so the function terminates without child cleanup. After some time those child view come into existence, resulting into zombie view leaving no any reference behind to remove those.p  pWhich approach should i use to remove these zombie view Sometimes they result in waking up of the dead main views as well.p  pCode in router, the function called before a particular view is initialize for a given route.p  precoderoutes      main mainHandler , initialize function       window.off.onhashchange, that.removepreviousview , mainHandler function        initializing mianView     that.view  new mainView , removepreviousview  function       if that.view           method called to delete subviews         that.view.deleteChildViews         removing child view itself         that.view.remove       codepre  pCode in mainViewp  precodeinitialize function       this.render , render function       this.el.html.templatemainTemplate     this.initiateChildView , initiateChildView function       this.childView  new ChildView , deleteChildViews function       if this.childView          used to remove childViews inside the child views.         this.childView.deleteChildViews         this.childView.remove       codepre

Negative 34595 pIve been setting up Orchard 1.8 in an Azure Cloud Service. Ive got it working, but Im now confused as to how to use it.p  pInstalling themes via the gallery fails silently. The devs say this is because Orchard on Azure doesnt support the theme gallery, and suggest adding new themes to the project and uploading a new package a hrefhttpsorchard.codeplex.comdiscussions453688 relnofollowhttpsorchard.codeplex.comdiscussions453688a. Ignoring that this requires any designers that want to make minor CSS changes now need Visual Studio, access to the entire source code, and then wait through a 20 minute deploy, this just doesnt seem possible.p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions19443077unabletorunlocallyorchardazureprojectysodfreshoffsourcesThis posta explains how the Azure emulator doesnt work with Orchard. So now Im confused what is the expected workflow for a brand new Orchard site hosted on Azure if I cant make changes to the site in production or staging but cannot run it locally either. Im aware I could run it without the Azure emulator on regular IIS but that seems to be too far removed from the production environment to be a good test.p  pI was drawn to Orchard originally because it had great documentation and supports MVC Web API, but this seems so fundamental that now Im not so sure. I feel like every time something goes wrong theyll always be doubt whether its working as designed or if there is an Azure idiosyncrasy going on.p  pId love to hear from anyone whos had an Orchard site from scratch in Azure, Im hoping Ive just missed something simple with this.p  pThanks, Tom p

This can happen when using the Attach method or setting the state of an entity to Unchanged or Modified if any entities in the graph have conflicting key values. This may be because some entities are new and have not yet received databasegenerated key values. In this case use the Add method or the Added entity state to track the graph and then set the state of nonnew entities to Unchanged or Modified as appropriate.p blockquote  pI guess, that the line where the existing image is loaded from the database is responsible for the exception, but I really dont know what to do.p

Once the same sounds start to play for the second time before the audio file ends, it creates this weird effect where it sounds like its skipping every other note or so. Im imagining this is because the AVAudioPlayer class is setup to be monovoiced.p  pAnother solution I tried was using an exs instrument instead of creating my own sample engine. I got it to load and play the instrument, but for some reason my exs file wasnt finding the sample files. It would load the sampler and say, unable to load kick1.wav, or snare1.wav. Not sure if maybe I exported my exs wrong.p

Negative 34595 pIm trying to make a little graphics program that has a circle of diameter 100 on the screen and from the center of it, a line is coming out of it that is always attached to the mouse pointer until such time that the user does a click, and then the line is permanently drawn.  Its exactly like MSPaints line, except that starting point is always the center of the circle.p  pI tried a few things that DONT work.p  ol lipI can get the line to appear only after a mouseclick.  Thats not what I want.  I want the line to always be present and pivoting from the circlecenter until the mouse is clicked and then its then permanently on the screen.pli lipI can get a smeary thing where the line is always being drawn.  It makes a sort of star shape, but thats not what I want either.pli ol  pBasically, I want the same functionality that you have in MSPaint when you draw a line.  What am I supposed to do  Draw the line and then erase it a second later, and then draw it again when the mouse is in a new position  I tried something like that, but it does a thing where it erases the background a little bit, and then the line is only drawn when the mouse is in motion, but not when the mouse is stationary.p  pIf anyone can provide a code snippet, thatd be great.  Or just some pseudocode.  p  pIs this the right pseudo code Start Left click and a line appears from center of circle to mouse tip Line stays there until a new mouse coordinate is made how do I keep track Line from center of circle to original location gets erased New line is made to new location of mouse coordinates.p  pI think this something of a statemachine to use what I learned in digital class.  How are states implemented in Cp  pAny help would be appreciated, and thanks to everyone that can understand my question even though Im probably not using the proper terminology.p

Ive tried a few different things that have gotten me close, but I was wondering if someone had a better or more complete solutions.p  pThings Ive triedp  precodelink.attr.connection opacity 0.0 codepre  pThis does indeed make the link invisible to the user, but still shows up and is editable when the users mouse moves over it.p  precodelink.attr.connection display non codepre  pThis doesnt even place the link on the palette, which does succeed in hiding it from the user, but is problematic because it is no longer tracked by the model.p  pFor a little more background information, these links can exist but cannot be created or utilized by the user, so I dont want them to be presented to the user.  However, when I query the palette for all of the links, I still want these to be present.p  pThanks for any help or ideas you can provide.p
Negative 34595 pI have the following trigger setup on my database.

Negative 34595 pI am struggling with sqlite crud actions in a class other than the database class. It just occurred to me that any CRUD actions need to happen in the database class and I call those parameterized functions from the calling class. I have tried to use the sqlite functionality from another class but cannot seem to get the environment set up correctly. This other class cannot seem to connect to the database. In this other class I have a list that I want to fill with records that I read. I can not get the crud actions to compile. Should I fill the list in a public method in the database class and pass the list back to the calling class And how would I do crud actions from a non database class using a database set up in a database class I thought this was a passig context action but that attempt appears that I am incorrect in my approach. Any help would keep me from any more angst over this mindset issue. I know it is nothing more than I am missing something.p

Negative 34595 pI have a problem with Unity3D. I created a game with Unity 4.6.2f1. My problem is, game crashes after splash screenLike trying to open itself constantly. The weird part is, game works on my phones and my tablets perfectly. I have Nexus 5With Android 5.1.1 , Iocean X7SWith Android 4.2.2 , PolyPad tabletAndroid 4.2.2 , Teclast X98Android 4.4.4. I had some beta testers which have LG G2 , Samsung S5660 , Sony Xperia Z3 , HTC M8. From these 4 phones only Samsung make it run while others failed. I first though that this is because display bits. So I unchecked 32 and 24 bits Display buffer. Same result. Then I triend to change forcing Open GL ES version. I tried to build it with Automatic section  I dont know if its failed or not but It started to fade to black after a time even in my devices so I guess Its not an option for fixing. Then I tried to force it to use Open GL ES 3.0 , failed again. Then I read in somewhere that my AdMob plugin might be the reason , so I removed the components of AdMob from scenes and deleted all AdMob Plugin files. Same result. Since the crashed phones are not under my control , Its really hard to detect real problem easily because I really need to beg to my friends for every test since my testers are my friends and they have their own personal life, according to them its more important than testing my game whole day. By the way , I would like to add this too , like a month ago , everything were alright. It was running normal on my friends phoneThe one who has G2. Im getting suspicious from signing the apk. Because before signing it , while I was sending it without sign , It was working. That might be wrong idea of course. Im not an expert so Im here for your helps. I really would like to know why this is happening and I want to fix this. Thanksp

Negative 34595 pWe have a DataFlow job that is subscribed to a PubSub stream of events. We have applied sliding windows of 1 hour with a 10 minute period. In our code, we perform a Count.perElement to get the counts for each element and we then want to run this through a Top.of to get the top N elements. p  pAt a high level 1 Read from pubSub IO 2 Window.intoSlidingWindows.ofwindowSize.everyperiod  windowSize  1 hour, period  10 mins 3 Count.perElement  4 Top.ofn, comparisonFunctionp  pWhat were seeing is that the window is being applied twice so data seems to be watermarked 1 hour 40 mins instead of 50 mins behind current time. When we dig into the job graph on the Dataflow console, we see that there are two groupByKey operations being performed on the data 1 As part of Count.perElement. Watermark on the data from this step onwards is 50 minutes behind current time which is expected. 2 As part of the Top.of in the Combine.PerKey. Watermark on this seems to be another 50 minutes behind the current time.

Negative 34595 pIm using MVC and Razor to develop an application for administrative purposes. Using the model shown below, im trying to display a matrix that the user can edit.

Negative 34595 pI have been working on a a hrefhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiNonogram relnofollownonograma solver in Java, and all of my algorithm works fine, but I have been struggling with the visualization a little bit.p  pDuring the execution of the algorithm, I have access to two solutionarrays.

Another array is of type codefloat[][]code which contains values between code0code and code1code, here code0code is for certainly white, code1code is for certainly black and a value of code.2code indicates it is more likely for the cell to be white than it to be black.p  pSince Ive recently switched from PHP to Java programming without proper introduction, I dont know much about visualizing this array properly.

Negative 34595 pAs the title already might suggest I am having a hard time describing my architectural problem and for the same reason searching has been without result. I am writing a command line application which aims to take in twodimensional data to which a physics model can be fitted by means of least squares fitting. I already have implemented a NelderMead and LevenbergMarquardt routine that work properly, i.e. given a set of data, a model and cost function, they will optimize an array of fitting parameters.p  pFor this purpose I want to write a class that facilitates the abstract functionality of optimization, independent of the actual model and cost function that will be used.p  precodeclass Fit  public     Fit     Fit      run  private     stdvectorltstdvectorltdoublegtgt mdata     stdvectorltdoublegt mparameters     stdvectorltdoublegt mevaluated  codepre  pThe actual optimization method coderuncode will look roughly like the followingp  precodevoid run       Set initial guess for parameters     mparameters  ...      whilecondition          double costvalue          Evaluate model function for current parameters         modelampmevaluated, mdata, mparameters         costampcostvalue, mdata, mevaluated          if costvalue lt thresholdvalue             break         else             updateparametersampmparameters       codepre  pThis is where my questions comes in. The codeFitruncode method needs to call a codemodelcode and codecostcode function but there is no knowing up front what these will look like or what function arguments they require. The arguments that they take in my example are the bare minimum required arguments as seen from the fitting procedure but there might be additional required arguments.p  pSpecific cost functions and model will be defined elsewhere but I have no clue how to let the codeFitcode class know which functions it needs to call. Coming from codeccode I was thinking function pointers but I have no clue how this is most preferably done in codeccode. Should codeFitcode have a function pointer member codemmodelcode that has to be set after it is instantiated I am just spitballing here. How would I best approach this and what is this problem called so I could maybe look for additional approachesp  pEdit to give a better idea of what I am trying to accomplish some pseudo code.p  precode Imagine multiple available functions that all work differently but take some array of parameters   which is then used to evaluate some function for a set of data values void modelastdvectorltdoublegt y, stdvectorltstdvectorltdoublegtgt data, stdvectorltdoublegt p      for int i i lt data[0].size i         y[i]  parameters[0]  parameters[1]data[0][i]   void modelbstdvectorltdoublegt y, stdvectorltstdvectorltdoublegtgt data, stdvectorltdoublegt p      for int i i lt data[0].size i         y[i]  parameters[0]  powdata[0][i], parameters[1]    Assume we have some data stdvectorltstdvectorltdoublegtgt data    Fit fit  Fit fitgtsetdatadata fitgtsetmodelmodela  This is what the question is about fitgtrun   Now we can extract and display the optimized parameter array stdvectorltdoublegt p  fit.parameters for int i i lt p.size i     stdcout ltlt p[i] ltlt stdendl codepre
