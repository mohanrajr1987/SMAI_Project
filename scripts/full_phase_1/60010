Positive 60010 pI have a program that uses Python tkinter to make radio buttons. I have 3 different variables , and each variable can be selected by selecting one out of many inputs which are specific to each variable meaning there are like 5 inputs per variable, for examplep  pfor examplep  precoderadio1  Radiobuttonsomeframe, textsomevalue, value1, variablethismyvar radio2  Radiobuttonsomeframe, textsomevalue2, value2, variablethismyvar radio3  Radiobuttonsomeframe, textsomevalue3, value3, variablethismyvar codepre  pThen repeat this 2 more times for variablethismyvar2 and variablethismyvar3. p  pI then have a function that will submit the variable values into a form. I was wondering how to pass it to that function p
Positive 60010 pI have a list of objects called codedeckListcode in my constructor. The list will hold objects of the type codeDeckcode.p  precodeself.deckList  [Deck] codepre  pIf I get the last element in the list by,p  precodedeck  self.deckList[lenself.deckList  1] codepre  pWhy is it that if I do, codedeck.code I will still get methods for a List object  Would I not get methods for the object type codeDeckcodep  pAny tipsp
Positive 60010 pso this is my code, the purpose of this code is to ask the user to input an value 1,2 or 3, if the user enter something else, it will shows invalid input when the user put 1,2 or 3, it will counts from 0 to the value that the user puts.     p  precodedef c     while True         i  inputGive me one of 1,2 or 3          if leni1 and igt1and ilt3            return inti         else            printinvalid input         for i in rangei1            printi c codepre  peverything works fine until the for loop, i am new learner in python and i have no idea on how to fix it.p

The problem is that reading a symbolic link makes python read the content where it is pointing to instead of its real content. In a few words, the user downloads the real file instead of the symbolic linkp  hr  pA possible solution to this would be to get the path where the symlink points to, and then generate the link in the buffer. Is this possiblep
Positive 60010 pIm currently learning Python from a book by Michael Dawson. Everything was clear and concise except when i got to an exercise called the Word Jumble Game. This is the code that is confusing me.p  precodeimport random       create a sequence of words to choose from     WORDS  python, jumble, easy, difficult, answer, xylophone       pick one word randomly from the sequence     word  random.choiceWORDS       create a variable to use later to see if the guess is correct     correct  word       create a jumbled version of the word     jumble      while word         position  random.randrangelenword         jumble  word[position]         word  word[position]  word[position  1] codepre  pWhat i dont understand is how the whileword works. This is the explanation givenp  blockquote   pI set the loop up this way so that it will continue until word is   equal to the empty string. This is perfect, because each time the loop   executes, the computer creates a new version of word with one letter   extracted and assigns it back to word. Eventually, word will become   the empty string and the jumbling will be done.p blockquote  pI tried tracing the program maybe its an obvious oversight on my behalf but i cannot see how the word eventually breaks out of the loop because as long as it has characters in it surely it would evaluate to True and be an infinite loop.p  pAny help is hugely appreciated guys as i have looked for answers everywhere and its been fruitless. Thanks in advance.p

Positive 60010 pI am trying to make a functional scaleslider on a tkinter canvas. I need the button on the slider to be clickdraggable along the slider length and also an increment and decrement button on either side to change the value by  1. The key factor is that, although the slider might be the same size graphically, I want to be able to change the maximum value it can go to with every instance of the class I have created for it. Obviously, I dont want the sliding button to go over the edges of the slider so the graphical range would actually be the maximum x position on canvas  offset  the width of the button. Lastly, I need the leftmost position to have a value of 0 and the rightmost position to have a value equal to that of the maximum value with roughly equal portions in between. So if the scale went from values 0 to 24, I could drag the button to a point where I can obtain any number from 123 aswell.p  pI worked out that the relationship between the value and the graphical size which may also be changed in an instance if desired is brx position on canvas  offset  maximum x position on canvas  offset  current value  maximum value bri.e. xxMax  nnMax brTherefore if we know n then x  n  xMax  nMax brand if we know x then n  x  nMax  xMaxp  pEDIT as Ive fixed the bugs regarding the incrementdecrement buttons My problem is that the scale button is not representing the values that it should e.g. it can go from 33168 when it should only go from 0150.p  pI would greatly appreciate some help as I think Ive been staring at the same code for too long and lost my way. Ive played around with it a lot so i think there might be an offset error but it may also has something to do with the graphical representation of pixels wherein a single difference of 1 value might have a difference of 1.7385 example pixels, and so the decimals add up or it rounds it to 2 pixels to draw it and then when the position is taken to find the value it finds a different value than that which was initially drawn...p  precodefrom tkinter import   class Slider     def initself, parent, x, y, settingPaneOffset0, w140, h15, default4, numRange150         self.parent  parent         self.settingPaneOffset  settingPaneOffset         self.offsetX  settingPaneOffset  x  10  Only going to be used in relation to the scale which has an addition offset of 10px because of the decrement button and spacing         self.offsetY  y         self.w  w         self.h  h  Height of all elements inline with scale         self.btnW  w20         self.defaultValue  default         self.xMax  w  2self.btnW         self.nMax  numRange          u  xw  Width of scale  the x offset coordinate         v  yh  Height  the y offset coordinate         self.decrementBtn  self.parent.createrectanglex, y, x8, v, filla3a3a3, width1, outline606060         self.scaleBack  self.parent.createrectanglex10, y, u10, v, fill8f8f8f, width1, outline606060         self.incrementBtn  self.parent.createrectangleu12, y, u20, v, filla3a3a3, width1, outline606060          self.scaleBtn  self.parent.createrectangle0, 0, 0, 0, filla3a3a3, width1, outline606060         self.num  self.parent.createtext0, 0, text, fill333333, fontTimes New Roman, 10         self.draw      def drawself         self.resetScale         bindList  self.scaleBack, self.scaleBtnClick, 0,                     self.scaleBtn, self.scaleBtnClick, 0,                     self.scaleBtn, self.scaleBtnClick, ltB1Motiongt,                     self.incrementBtn, self.incrementBtnClick, 0,                     self.decrementBtn, self.decrementBtnClick, 0,                     self.scaleBack, lambda e self.colourButtonself.scaleBtn, a3a3a3, 1,                     self.scaleBtn, lambda e self.colourButtonself.scaleBtn, a3a3a3, 1,                     self.incrementBtn, lambda e self.colourButtonself.incrementBtn, a3a3a3, 1,                     self.decrementBtn, lambda e self.colourButtonself.decrementBtn, a3a3a3, 1         self.bindTagsbindList      def bindTagsself, bindList         for i in bindList             e  0ltButtonPress1gt, 1ltButtonRelease1gt.geti[2], i[2]             self.parent.tagbindi[0], e, i[1]      def colourButtonself, obj, c self.parent.itemconfigobj, fillc     def getNumself, x return x  self.nMax  self.xMax     def getScalePosself, n return n  self.xMax  self.nMax     def getScaleBtnself, centre return [self.offsetXcentreself.btnW, self.offsetXcentreself.btnW]      def showNumberOfSeatsself, x, n         self.parent.coordsself.num, xself.btnW, self.offsetY8         self.parent.itemconfigself.num, textn      def redrawScaleself, btnCoords, nNone         self.n  roundself.getNumbtnCoords[0]self.btnW ifn is None else n         self.parent.coordsself.scaleBtn, btnCoords[0], self.offsetY, btnCoords[1], self.offsetY  self.h         self.showNumberOfSeatsbtnCoords[0], self.n      def scaleBtnClickself, event         self.colourButtonself.scaleBtn, c3c3c3         btnCoordsEvt  self.getScaleBtnevent.xself.offsetX         btnCoordsMin  self.getScaleBtnself.btnW         btnCoordsMax  self.getScaleBtnself.xMax  self.btnW         ifevent.xltbtnCoordsMin[0]self.btnW self.redrawScalebtnCoordsMin         elifevent.xgtbtnCoordsMax[1]self.btnW self.redrawScalebtnCoordsMax         else self.redrawScalebtnCoordsEvt      def incrementBtnClickself, event         self.colourButtonself.incrementBtn, c3c3c3         ifself.n lt self.nMax             self.n  1             self.redrawScaleself.getScaleBtnself.getScalePosself.n  self.btnW, self.n      def decrementBtnClickself, event         self.colourButtonself.decrementBtn, c3c3c3         ifself.n gt 0             self.n  1             self.redrawScaleself.getScaleBtnself.getScalePosself.n  self.btnW, self.n      def resetScaleself         self.n  self.defaultValue         btnCoords  self.getScaleBtnself.getScalePosself.n         self.parent.coordsself.scaleBtn, btnCoords[0]self.settingPaneOffset, self.offsetY, btnCoords[1]self.settingPaneOffset, self.offsetYself.h         self.showNumberOfSeatsbtnCoords[0]self.settingPaneOffset, self.n   def callbackevent     printclicked at, event.x, event.y  ifnamemain     root  Tk     root.titleSlider on a canvas     canvas  Canvasroot, bgFFFFFF, width600, height400, borderwidth0, highlightthickness0     canvas.pack     s0  Slidercanvas, 100, 50     s1  Slidercanvas, 100, 100, default5, numRange10     s2  Slidercanvas, 100, 150, default8, numRange20     s3  Slidercanvas, 100, 200, default10, numRange15     root.bindltButton1gt, callback     root.mainloop codepre

Negative 60010 pHow to fire up event from a separate C programp  pThe C program I am working on has two separate components Task Creator TC and Task Processor TP. TC is attached to a web service that constantly inserts new tasks into a database table. On the other hand TP reads from the same table and processes each tasks then updates the status back to the same table. Its almost like a queue but done using database rather than e.g. MSMQ. Every 5 seconds TP wakes up and reads from the table to check for unprocessed tasks however this has some performance impacts. When theres no new tasks its a bit of waste to fire up a select from where SQL statement. The ideal way is to have some kind of notification method that when new tasks are inserted TP will get notified and then wakes up from its dream to check for new tasks. p  pstrongCurrent solutionstrongp  pimg srchttpyuml.me3b49bcfd altdiagram of current solution p  pstrongIdeal solutionstrongp  pimg srchttpyuml.me5cf843a5 altdiagram of idealsolution p

I want to keep the warnings for the implicit cast, but not the explicit casts.p  pI know I could hack around this be creating a special T vectorcastT2 type method that uses explicit casts for each element internally, but Id rather be able to use the CStyle and staticcastsp

Negative 60010 pI need to know via javascript whether a page has focus or not.p  pWhen the user switches to another tab, minimizes the browser, or clicks outside the browser, the page shouldnt have focus.p  pWhen the user returns to the window, by opening it, returning to the tab, clicking on the page, the page needs to have focus.p  pThe problem is the method must correctly report whether the page has focus or not when there is a flash swf on the page that may or may not have focus and I dont have control of the swf content.p  pThe windows focus needs to be independent of the flash swfs focus. So when the swf has focus, the user leaves the browser whilst the flash swf has focus, or when the user returns directly to the swf, the windows focus must be reported correctly.p  pI have methods of doing this in FireFox 3.0, 3.5, IE 6, 7, 8, Safari 4.0.3, 4.0.4, Opera 9.0.p  pThe standard focusblur window events do not work properly in Google Chrome.

Negative 60010 pWe have a program written in c that goes through emails in outlook 2007 and parses out contact information that may be contained in the body of the email or any attachments.  What weve found is that any email we get from apple mail, while having legitimate attachments, may also have other attachments that are not the types of files we want to parse.  Some of them contain a previous email conversation while others have the signature of the sender.

I am interested in subdividing those regions. p  pI got started thinking about this after reading this paragraph from this paper  a hrefhttpwww.cs.utah.edushirleypapersraynurbs.pdf relnofollowhttpwww.cs.utah.edushirleypapersraynurbs.pdfa , which explains how to create a tree of bounding volumes with a depth relative to the degree of the surfacep  precodeThe convex hull property of Bspline surfaces guarantees that the surface is contained in the convex hull of its control mesh. As a result, any convex objects which bound the mesh will bound the underlying surface. We can actually make a stronger claim because we closed the knot intervals in the last section [made the multiplicity of the internal knots k  1], each nonempty interval [ui ui1  [vj vj1 corresponds to a surface patch which is completely contained in the convex hull of its corresponding mesh points. Thus, if we produce bounding volumes for each of these intervals, we will have completely enclosed the surface. We form the tree by sorting the volumes according tothe axis direction which has greatest extent across the bounding volumes, splitting the data in half, and repeating the process. codepre  pThanks Seanp

Negative 60010 pI have a web application running in a jboss application server But it is not jboss specific so we could also assume it is a tomcat or any other server. Now I have the problem that one thread seems to be in deadlock situation. It uses 100 CPU all the time. I have started the server with enabled debug port and I can connect Eclipse to it. But the problem is There are a lot of threads running. How can I find the right thread I know the process id from Linux top command but I think this will not help.

Negative 60010 pIm beginning to work with Eclipse for some Java development. Im quite new to Eclipse, as I am a Visual Studio developer normally.p  pI tried to install the CheckStyle Eclipse PlugIn and Subversive, using the Eclipse Install new Software feature.

The code is posted below, and the issues beneath it.p  precodevoid GetListItemData HWND hListWnd, long index, char outputResult       int result     DWORD processID     HANDLE hProcess     char itemData     char sDataRead[5]     DWORD bytes     DWORD lListItemHold, lListItemDataHold     outputResult0      if hListWnd               GetWindowThreadProcessId hListWnd, ampprocessID           hProcessOpenProcess 0x100xf0000PROCESSVMREAD, 0, processID           if hProcess                       lListItemHoldDWORDSendMessage hListWnd, LBGETITEMDATA, index1, 0              lListItemHoldlListItemHold24              resultReadProcessMemory hProcess, void lListItemHold, ampsDataRead, 4, ampbytes              if result                               RaiseWinErr                           memcpy amplListItemDataHold, ampsDataRead, 4              lListItemDataHoldlListItemDataHold6              ReadProcessMemory hProcess, void lListItemDataHold, outputResult, 16, ampbytes               CloseHandle hProcess                 codepre  pMy understanding, limited as it is, is that codelListItemHoldlListItemHold24code tries to account for whatever structure is in the ListBox and pass through the first 24 bytes of it, and return what remains. However this does not seem to be working for me. p  pCan anyone shed some light on things I could try I know I am grasping at straws as it is.

Negative 60010 pI have the following layers in my project WebUI, Service, Repository, Common and some other that I dont think matter for this case.p  pI have a email table that keeps all the site generated email data in it.

The EmailType table works great in the admin which generates test emails but for the actual Web layer  the call to the service needs the hard coded values in the repository.p  pMy question is, is this the best or recommended way to do this or can I make this more dynamic in some way  The part I dont like about this is my service layer needs a method for every email since the web layer should touch the repository.p  pAlso would placing the enum in the service layer be incorrect placement if seperation of code was a concern.p  pThanks,p

Negative 60010 pIn a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7314333findshortestpathfromvertexutovpassingthroughavertexwthis earlier questiona the OP asked how to find a shortest path in a graph that goes from u to v and also passes through some node w.  The accepted answer, which is quite good, was to run Dijkstras algorithm twice  once to get from u to w and once to get from w to v.  This has time complexity equal to two calls to Dijkstras algorithm, which is Om  n log n.p  pNow consider a related question  you are given a sequence of nodes usub1sub, usub2sub, ..., usubksub and want to find the shortest path from usub1sub to usubksub such that the path passes through usub1sub, usub2sub, ..., usubksub in order.  Clearly this could be done by running k1 instances of Dijkstras algorithm, one for each pair of adjacent vertices, then concatenating the shortest paths together.  This takes time Okm  k n log n.  Alternatively, you could use an allpairs shortest paths algorithm like Johnsons algorithm to compute all shortest paths, then concatenate the appropriate shortest paths together in Omn  nsup2sup log n time, which is good for k much larger than n.p  pMy question is whether there is an algorithm for solving this problem that is faster than the above approaches when k is small.  Does such an algorithm exist  Or is iterated Dijkstras as good as it getsp

Negative 60010 pI am currently implementing an EclipsePlugin which is using the standard properties view, connected to a Navigator. It also features a textual editor, which is able to connect regions within its document to certain objects that can supply properties to the PropertiesView i.e. the same objects, that are displayed in the Navigator. However, the Tuturials I found only dealt with Views that used a preimplemented Viewer, which already supported passing on the selected element to the Properties View. The TextEditor does not do that I am using jface and a subclass of the AbstractTextEditor class, because its SelectionProvider returns informations about the offset and the length of the selection only. How do I have to modify the SelectionProvider of my TextEditor, such that it provides information usable to the Properties Viewp  pThank you in advancep

Negative 60010 pWe do shortterm rentals on cell phones and tablets.  You need a tablet for a week, you can come to us and we rent it too you.  What happens, is at the end of the week or weeks you need to return it.  Often the person renting doesnt return it various reason, but now it is stolen property.  We have an application that we load and can send a command to that locks the device.  Or we can program the app to allow xdays and then lock like a parking meter.  Once locked, it requires a password to unlock.  This works, but it only works if the user hasnt already reset the device back to factory.  If we load the application and rent it to someone for 2 weeks as example, we find that often the renter will reset the device back to factory.  Various reasons they do it, mostly they are playing around with it and just want to start over.  Or if their time is up, it locks and then they pay for another rental period and we give them the password to unlock it.  In this case, they now know we have a rental meter running.p  pWe can root the device and install the application as a system application, but chasing down rooting tools and playing cat and mouse with vendors trying to prevent rooting is too much labor.  p  pWhat I need, is there a way to put a password on the factory reset in the Android settings  I do realize that most MFGs of devices allow you to press buttons and reset but that I can live with.  What I need is a way not to have the reset button in the settings of the Android so easily executed.  Anyone have a way to do thisp

However, I added log4j.jar directly in Installed JRE in Eclipse in the main system JRE and now the pure log4j works. What seems to me is that there is quite a difference between the OpenJDK and the Suns JDK, and that is causing problems. Ill try to fix this slf4j issue in a few days. Maybe there is also a need for some jar on some weird place.p  pEDIT3 slf4j now works with log4j, but I have to manually configure it. Doesnt matter where I put log4j.xml, it doesnt read it. Looks like classloader problem with Suns JDK. Ill try with Logback soon. It might be similar problem.p

Negative 60010 pi am thinking about creating a sort of text based mmorpg game, i have a fair amount of experience in designing and building websites.

For example they could the game might involve the player building a house, the system for a tick based game might say your house will be ready in 3 ticks, i want a system where it might say your house will be ready in 3 minutes.

Negative 60010 pThis is a colour space gamma encoding questionp  pI am taking images from a raw 5MP Image sensor. This sensor produces 8 Bit RGB Bayer, and has Auto White Balance and Auto Gain, but does not do colour space conversion gamma  on the sensor other versions of this sensor do. p  pAccording to the theory, both from the manufacturer and the Internet, see wikipedia for color image pipeline  there should be an encoding gamma correction of the image in the color pipeline before I convert to YCbCr and JPegp  pIf I take the RAW RGB Bayer images, and then load them in Irfanview which demosaics and save as BMP, then the results I am getting before applying gamma look like this  a hrefhttpflic.krpbCWz5n relnofollowhttpflic.krpbCWz5na and this a hrefhttpflic.krpbq2CD1 relnofollowhttpflic.krpbq2CD1a.  FLickr has downsampled but I assume doesnt affect the colour space. As far as I can tell these images dont need gamma encoding correction  If I apply .45 encoding they become too dark, 2.2 decoding they get washed out. There may be other colour balance issues.p  pSo my question is p  pa Is there some reason I dont need to apply gammap  pb Have I missed something e.g. does irfanview demosaic also apply a gamma correction  I have looked at this and think it doesnt  when I look at the raw values of RGB for a grey block in a colour chart I am getting individual  R,G,B approx 104,116,145 in the Bayer, and then in the BMP I am getting very similar values for the RGB triples after Saving as a BMP after the irfanview RAW importp

Negative 60010 pWeve been experiencing a strange issue with SQL 2008 R2 10.50.1600 installed as a named instance. In order for any external clients to connect, we have a certain procedure we have to follow, but should not have to. Now I did in fact open the codeTCPIPcode and codeNamed Pipescode protocols on the SQL server and restarted it, this isnt the problem. Were on an Active Directory Domain running from Server 2003. The problem exists no matter what OS the server or client is XP, 2003, 2008, Vista, 7, 64bit, 32bit, etc.. The problem also persists from anything which can connect, for example, SQL Management Studio, ADO from our applications, etc.p  pThe problem is that before any client can connect to this server, each client machine must first connect to this server through ODBC and we dont use ODBC. Any attempt to connect to a 10.5 SQL server before doing this results in Server does not exist or access denied. But once we can connect in the ODBC through codeNamed Pipescode, then everything else starts to work. The same issue occurs both when using the Computer Name and IP Address. In fact, if we want to connect with computer name  instance name, then we have to do so first in the ODBC, and then if we want to connect via the IP address  instance name, then we have to do the same also for that.p  pWeve been having to do this on every single client computer. Again, once the ODBC is able to connect to this SQL server through Named Pipes, then all future attempts from that client work.p  pWhat could be causing this to occur How to avoid it I should not have to do this ODBC Trick as weve been calling it. Ive never had this issue on any other version of SQL.p

Negative 60010 pI am presently writing a Python script to process some 10,000 or so input documents. Based on the scripts progress output I notice that the first 400 documents get processed really fast and then the script slows down although the input documents all are approximately the same size.p  pI am assuming this may have to do with the fact that most of the document processing is done with regexes that I do not save as regex objects once they have been compiled. Instead, I recompile the regexes whenever I need them.p  pSince my script has about 10 different functions all of which use about 10  20 different regex patterns I am wondering what would be a more efficient way in Python to avoid recompiling the regex patterns over and over again in Perl I could simply include a modifier codeocode.p  pMy assumption is that if I store the regex objects in the individual functions usingp  precodepattern  re.compile codepre  pthe resulting regex object will not be retained until the next invocation of the function for the next iteration each function is called but once per document.p  pCreating a global list of precompiled regexes seems an unattractive option since I would need to store the list of regexes in a different location in my code than where they are actually used.p  pAny advice here on how to handle this neatly and efficientlyp

Negative 60010 pI am writing an app to connect to a third party application using REST web services.p  pI have a configuration page that asks for an IP, Port, User Name amp Password, currently it just blindly assumes you enter the correct details and attempts a connection.p  pI want to create a test routine that goes through and checks off the following steps when setting up the config informationp  ol liIs the IPHostname correct using ping or something  li liIs the Port correctli liIs the Username amp Password correctli ol  pthen displays the results on screen as its going so that if it cant connect to the service its easier to identify where the issue is.p  pTo achieve step 1 I would like to use Ping or some equivalent that does not rely on a particular port being open. So I can eliminate dodgy DNS or a typo in the IPHostname.p  pI understand from previous questions asked that ping wasnt possible in 7.0 but with Mango the sockets classes have been added in, is it possible now, if so how If it still isnt possible is there a different way I can achieve step 1p

Negative 60010 pI am implementing an application using ember.js and couchdb. I choose emberresource as database access layer because it nicely supports nested JSON documents.p  pSince couchdb uses the attribute rev for optimistic locking in every document, this attribute has to be updated in my application after saving the data to the couchdb.p  pMy idea to implement this is to reload the data right after saving to the database and get the new rev back with the rest of the document.p  pHere is my code for thisp  precode Since we use CouchDB, we have to make sure that we invalidate and refetch  every document right after saving it. CouchDB uses an optimistic locking  scheme based on the attribute rev in the documents, so we reload it in  order to have the correct rev value. didSave     function      this.super.applythis, arguments     this.forceReload ,   reload resource after save is done, expire to make reload really do something forceReload function      this.expire   Everything OK up to this location     Ember.run.nextthis, function          this.fetch   SubDocument is reset here, and not refetched             .failfunctionerror                  App.displayErrorerror                          .donefunction                  App.logApp.Resource.forceReload fetch done, got revision   self.getrev                    codepre  pThis works for most cases, but if i have a nested model, the submodel is replaced with the old version of the data just before the fetch is executedp  pInterestingly enough, the correct updated data is stored in the database and the wrong old data is in the memory model after the fetch, although the rev attribut is correct as well as all attributes of the main object.p  pHere is a part of my object definitionp  precodeApp.TaskDefinition  App.Resource.define  url App.dbPrefix  courseware,  schema      id          String,     rev        String,     type        String,     name       String,     comment    String,     task                 type   App.Task,         nested true         App.Task  App.Resource.define  schema      id String,     title       String,     description String,      startImmediate Boolean,     holdOnComment Boolean,     .....  other attributes and subobjects   codepre  pAny ideas where the problem might bep  pThanks a lot for any suggestionp  pKind regards, Thomasp

Negative 60010 pI am trying to do a query with an outer join, and Ive always used Oracle PlSQL in the past, but am now trying to learn MySQL. Im trying to join 3 tables, USERS, USERTYPE, and GRADE. The USERS table contains column, USERTYPEID, which is a foreign key to USERTYPE, and it also contains column, GRADEID which is a foreign key to GRADE. I need the outer join because user types could be student, faculty, etc, and if it is a faculty member then the USER does not have a grade, hence a NULL GRADEID in the USER table. Here is what my query would have looked like in the past using  for the outer join.p  precodeSELECT A.USERNAME      , A.USERTYPEID      , B.USERTYPEDESC      , A.GRADEID      , C.GRADEDESC   FROM USERS A      , USERTYPE B      , GRADE C  WHERE A.USERTYPEID  B.USERTYPEID    AND A.GRADEID  C.GRADEID  codepre  pCould someone please help me translate this into a MySQL queryp  pThanks in advancep

Negative 60010 pI have to define the VC dimension for the union of two hypothesis sets H1 U H2 but I am having problems to visualize the meaning of the union of the hypothesis sets. For example, if H1 is a two dimensional perceptron and H2 is another two dimensional perceptron. What does it mean to have a hypothesis set H that is the union of H1 and H2 in this case. Can I use both H1 and H2 at same time. That is, am I able to use two lines in my classification algorithm....  If H1 contains h11,h12,h13...h1n hypothesis and H2 contains h21,h22,h23...h2n hypothesis, the union of H1 and H2 contains h11,h12,h13...h1n,h21,h22,h23...h2n hypothesis. In the 2d preceptron example, the union H1 U H2 contains more hypothesis but each hypothesis is of the same kind a line in the plane. It does not seem to be a diff between H1, H2 and H1UH2...Need help to understand the meaning of union of hypothesis sets...Thanksp

Negative 60010 pIve been having a problem for some time, and Ive exhausted all means of figuring this out for myself.  p  pI have 2 lists in a MS Sharepoint 2010 environment that are holding personal physician data for a medical group...nothing special just mainly text fields and a few lookup choice fields.p  pI am trying to write a program that will migrate the data over from List A to List B.  I am using LINQ to Sharepoint to accomplish this.  Everything compiles just fine, but when it runs and hits the SubmitChanges method, I get a runtime error that statesp  pAll new entities within an object graph must be addedattached before changes are submitted.p  pthis issue must be outside of my realm of C knowledge because I simply cannot find the solution for it.  The problem is DEFINITELY stemming from the fact that some of the columns are of type Lookup, because when I create a new Physician entity in my LINQ query, if I comment out the fields that deal with the lookup columns, everything runs perfectly.p  pWith the lookup columns included, if I debug and hit breakpoints before the SubmitChanges method, I can look at the new Physician entities created from the old list and the fields, including data from the lookup columns, looks good, the data is in there the way I want it to be, it just flakes out whenever it tries to actually update the new list with the new entities.p  pI have tried several methods of working around this error, all to no avail.  In particular, I have tried created a brand new EntityList list and calling the Attach method after each new Physician Entity is created, but to no avail, it just sends me around in a bunch of circles, chasing other errors such as ID cannot be null, Cannot insert entities that have been deleted etc.,  p  pI am no farther now than when I first got this error and any help that anyone can offer would certainly be appreciated.p  pHere is my codep  precodeusing ProviderDataContext ctx  new ProviderDataContexthttpdev                       SPSite sitecollection  new SPSitehttpdev             SPWeb web  sitecollection.OpenWeb             SPList theOldList  web.Lists.TryGetListOldListPhysicians               Create new Physician entities.                     foreachSPListItem l in theOldList.Items                                              PhysiciansItem p  new PhysiciansItem                                                      FirstName  Stringl[First Name],                             Title  Stringl[Last Name],                               MiddleInitial  Stringl[Middle Init],                             ProviderNumber  Convert.ToInt32l[Provider No],                             Gender  ConvertGenderl,                             UndergraduateSchool Stringl[UGSchool],                             MedicalSchool  Stringl[MedSchool],                              Residency  Stringl[Residency],                             Fellowship  Stringl[Fellowship],                              Internship  Stringl[Internship],                                 PhysicianType  ConvertToPhysiciantypel,                             Specialty  ConvertSpecialtiesl,                             InsurancesAccepted  ConvertInsurancel,                                             ctx.Physicians.InsertOnSubmitp                                           ctx.SubmitChanges this is where it flakes out                      Theses are conversion functions that I wrote to convert the data from the old list to the new lookup columns.      private Gender ConvertGenderSPListItem l              Gender g  new Gender         if Stringl[Sex]  M                      g  Gender.M                  else g  Gender.F         return g            Process and convert the Physician Type, namely the distinction between MD Medical Doctor and      DO Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine.

Negative 60010 pI find the routes engine extremely useful in CakePHP, and the documentation outlines how to disable the default routes, referring to the two that are present on a vanilla installation one for the emhomeem page display, another for any other page display under the empagesem path.p  pDisabling these does not appear to disable other routes though. For example, a Post model is still accessible via strongpostsstrong, strongpostsview1strong, etc, whereas I was hoping to hide all these default views from public, only allowing specific content to display in the routes of my choosing.p  pCould search engines index two pages for the same content if my configuration remained with default routes turned on If not, I still dont really like the idea of the public figuring out the core route for a page and being able to access it through a nonpublic, yet still accessible, URL.p

Negative 60010 pI am curious as to how the concept of inheritance takes place in the world of object oriented programming. Let me explain my dilemma I came across this dilemma while studying Java but I hope that my question is generic in nature p  pSuppose there is a class A and a class B. Class A stronginheritsstrong Class B. What does this actually mean Does the compiler make a strongnewstrong class, which is emTHENem instantiated into an object which contains the elements of both the classes A and B behind the scenes If thats the case, then how are the access restrictions implemented according to the access specifiersp  pFor a moment, I wondered if it happens in the following manner p  pAn object of class A is created and then an object of class B is created. Java then somehow link the members of A to the members of B and make it appear as if they belonged to the same class and it does that according to the access specifiers. p  pBut then, it occurred to me that there is a fault with this theory. Suppose two different classes, B and C are inheriting class A. Then, if we are going to make objects of class B and class C, then theyll have their OWN copies of the elements of class A. So this theory fails too.p  pI was just trying to explain the confusion about inheritance that I have in my mind. Its giving me headache. Please help.p  pEDIT  This is a link to a discussion related to my question which i found on this site. p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4716040doessubclassesinheritprivatefieldsDoes subclasses inherit private fieldsap

Negative 60010 pI have 3 different possible rootelements with different names, lets call them foo, bar and baz. All these possible rootelements have the same type, simply called fooBarOrBazType.p  pNow when I generate my class from the XSDs, only the first element is created with fooBarOrBazType. So I could create that type and when I serialize it, it will be called foo. I dont see any generated entries for either bar or baz.p  pThis happens both when all of the rootelements are in the same schema and when theyre split into different xsdfiles.p  pIs there any way to generate it so that every differently named element gets its own corresponding classp  pShould I use some sort of inheritance so 3 different types are created How do I fix this inheritancep  pI found it out myself, apparently, usingp  precodeltxselement namefoogt ltxscomplexTypegt   ltxscomplexContentgt     ltxsextension basepfooBarBazTypegt   ltxscomplexContentgt ltxscomplexTypegt codepre  pp  pwas sufficient.p

Negative 60010 pemForewordem I am trying to describe the scenario very precisely here. The codeTLDRcode version is how do I tell if a lambda will be compiled into an instance method or a closure...p  pI am using MvvmLight in my WPF projects, and that library recently changed to using codeWeakReferencecode instances in order to hold the actions that are passed into a codeRelayCommandcode. So, effectively, we have an object somewhere which is holding a codeWeakReferencecode to an codeActionltTgtcode.p  pNow, since upgrading to the latest version, some of our commands stopped working. And we had some code like thisp  precodectorGuid token      Command  new RelayCommandx gt Messenger.Default.Sendx, token  codepre  pThis caused a closure please correct me if Im not using the correct term class to be generated  like thisp  precode[CompilerGenerated] private sealed class ltgtcDisplayClass4      public object token      public void lt.ctorgtb0ReportType x              Messenger.Default.SendltReportTypeSelectedgtnew ReportTypeSelectedX, this.token        codepre  pThis worked fine previously, as the action was stored within the codeRelayCommandcode instance, and was kept alive whether it was compiled to an instance method or a closure i.e. using the ltDisplayClass syntax.p  pHowever, now, because it is held in a codeWeakReferencecode, the code only works if the lambda specified is compiled into an instance method. This is because the closure class is instantiated, passed into the codeRelayCommandcode and virtually instantly garbage collected, meaning that when the command came to be used, there was no action to perform. So, the above code has to be modified. Changing it to the following causes that, for instancep  precodeGuid token ctorGuid token      token  token     Command  new RelayCommandx gt Messenger.Default.Sendx, token  codepre  pThis causes the compiled code to result in a member  like the followingp  precode[CompilerGenerated] private void lt.ctorgtb0ReportType x      Messenger.Default.SendltReportTypeSelectedgtnew ReportTypeSelectedX, this.token  codepre  pNow the above is all fine, and I understand why it didnt work previously, and how changing it caused it to work. However, what I am left with is something which means the code I write now has to be stylistically different based on a compiler decision which I am not privy to. p  pstrongSo, my question isstrong  is this a documented behaviour in all circumstances  or could the behaviour change based on future implementations of the compiler Should I just forget trying to use lambdas and always pass an instance method into the codeRelayCommandcode Or should I have a convention whereby the action is always cached into an instance memberp  precodeActionltReportTypeSelectedgt commandAction ctorGuid token      commandAction  x gt Messenger.Default.Sendx, token     Command  new RelayCommandcommandAction  codepre  pAny background reading pointers are also gratefully acceptedp

Right now my components variable looks like thatp  precodepublic components  array   Acl,   Auth gt array     authorize gt array       Actions gt arrayactionPath gt controllers     ,     loginRedirect gt arraycontroller gt posts, action gt index,     logoutRedirect gt arraycontroller gt display, action gt home        ,   Session  codepre  pWhen I try to run this code I get the error emFatal error Class AppController not found in CwampwwwcakephplibCakeControllerCakeErrorController.php on line 31em. The weird thing is that everything works fine if I just comment out the logoutRedirect line. Do you have any clue on what is happeningp

Negative 60010 pI am planning for an android application that needs database. My plan is to use Google Cloud SQL for database, and build APIs using Google App Engine GAE.

If I use this API in an android or any OS application, will the user have to signin every time the application is launched  I havent tried, but I want the user to signin only the first time, will GAE work that way  Just wanted to clarify.

Negative 60010 pMIBs headquarter has emNem water tanks. Tank emiem can store at most emcsubisubem units of water. Each tank has its own incoming and outgoing pipes.  Incoming pipe of tank emiem leaks water at rate emusubisubem, which means if we want to put 100 units of water into tank emiem, 1001  emusubisubem water will be consumed. Outgoing pipes are all perfect. Their capacities are eminsubisubem and emoutsubisubem, which means the tank emiems incoming pipe can carry at most eminsubisubem units of water in one unit of time including leakage, and outgoing pipe can carry at most emoutsubisubem units of water in one unit of time. p  pThe integer sequence emwsubtsubem 1 lt t lt T represents how much water may be put into or has to be taken from this water storage system. For example 5, 3, 8, 10 means the system can intake at most 5, 3, and 10 units of water at the 1st, 2nd, and 4th time slots, and has to outlet 8 units of water at the 3rd time slot. It is called unfeasible if the amount of outlet water violates the requirement violating intake requirement is fine.  The question is, given the parameters of each tank emcsubisubem, emusubisubem, eminsubisubem, emoutsubisubem, and the sequence emwsubtsubem, weather it is feasible to satisfy all outlet requirement All tanks are empty at time 0. p  pN lt 10,000, T lt 10,000p  pThanksp

Negative 60010 pI have added a field to a Payroll Interface definition. I am using the delivered field TEXT254.  The field where you define the length of the field in bytes field definition table is three characters, so it would emappearem that you can define the length as 999 bytes.  The PI process fails when I set the length to 999 bytes, until I lowered it to 150 bytes.  I am experimenting, with it, slowly increasing the value Im wondering if anyone knows what the limit really is  Our PI takes 3 hours to run, so experimenting takes a long time.p  pedit  I cut down the runtime by getting rid of all but one company.  The largest byte size that I seem to be able to get to run is 240.  I did some research, and it looks like when you build your tables, Oracle will set the field to VARCHAR2n3 where n is the size of the field specified in AppDesigner.  Sure enough, the script generated by the Project...Build sets my field to VARCHAR2762.p
Negative 60010 pI am going to admit that I am battling with changing face of C  and unlearning what I learnt since starting out with C1.p  pI started years ago writing greenfield C 1.1 code and also currently work a lot with maintenance work on code that is written with previous versions of C.  Being exposed to the old ways of doing things is hard as I am battling to unlearn from code what I have written in the past and that I have to look at daily that was written in previous versions of C. Having to maintain Java projects also doesnt help as it is similar to C1. With time I could probably unlearn my bad practices but with project deadlines it is hard to do.p  pMy lazy mind also is against me as its logic says if  I use OO and DRY principles and the code compiles my boss is happy and thinks all is good when I am just not simplifying my code with new ways of doing things.p  pI have started reading Jon Skeets C in depth 2ed as what it does it gives the code solutions to do a specific tasks  for each of C1,C2,C3,C4 each time showing the code examples how it simplifies code but I am finding it hard to remember and put into practice these new methods due to having to still deal with all this legacy code daily and still having to balance my jack of all trades dev jobs.p  ol lipIs there an easy way to refactor between coding practices from C1,C2,C3 to C4 either on the fly or at compile time and give suggests either in English language or refactor the code for me.pli lipIs there anywhere like a tool or a site I can see the changes for the same code between the C versions excluding Jon Skeets C in depth bookpli ol

Negative 60010 pI am currently performing some benchmarks of a server application I have developed, heavily relying on C5 asyncawait constructs.p  pThis is a Console app so there is no synchronization context and no threads are explicitly being created in the code. The application is dequeuing requests from an MSMQ queue as fast as it can asynchronous dequeuing loop , and treat each requests before sending the processed requests via an HttpClient.p  pIOs relying on asyncawait are dequeuing from MSMSQ, reading data  writing data to an SQL server DB and finally HttpClient request sending in the end of the chain.p  pCurrently, for my benchmarks, the DB is completely faked results are directly returned via Task.FromResult and the HttpClient is faked as well await a random Task.Delay between 050 ms and return a response, so the real only IO is the dequeuing from MSMQ.p  pI already have improved the throughput of the application a lot by seeing that a lot of time was spent in GC, so I used CLR Profiler and found out where I could optimize things.p  pI am now trying to see if I can still improve throughput, and I think it may be possible.p  pThere are two things I dont understand and maybe there is some througput improvement possibility behind this p  pstrong1strong I have 4 CPU cores well in fact just 2 real ones ... i7 CPU, and when the application runs, it only uses 3 CPU cores at most in VS2012 concurrency visualizer I can clearly see that only 3 cores are being used, and in windows perfmon I can see CPU usage peeking at 7580. Any idea why  I have no control over the threads as I am not explicitely creating them, only relying on Tasks, so why does the Task scheduler doesnt maximize CPU usage in my case  Anyone experienced this p  pstrong2strong Using VS2012 concurency visualizer I can see a very high synchronization time approx 20 execution and 80 synchronization. F.Y.I Approx 15 threads are being created.p  pApprox 60 of the synchronization is coming from the following call stack p  precodeclr.dllThreadPoolMgrWorkerThreadStart clr.dllCLRSemaphoreWait kernelbase.dllWaitForSingleObjectEx codepre  pandp  precodeclr.dllThreadPoolMgrWorkerThreadStart clr.dllThreadPoolMgrUnfairSemaphoreWait clr.dllCLRSemaphoreWait  kernelbase.dllWaitForSingleObjectEx codepre  pAnd approx 30 of the synchronization is coming from p  precodeclr.dllThreadPoolMgrCompletionPortThreadStart kernel32.dllGetQueueCompletionStatusStub kernelbase.dllGetQueuedCompletionStatus ntdll.dllZwRemoveIoCompletion  ..... blablabla  ntoskrnl.exeKeRemoveQueueEx codepre  pI dont know if this is normal to experience such high synchronization or not.p  pstrongEDIT strong Based on Stephen answer, I am adding more details about my implementation p  pIndeed my server is completely asynchronous. However some CPU work is done to process each message not that much I admit, but still some. After a message is received from MSMQ queue, it is first deserialized most of the CPUmemory cost seems to happen at this point, then it passes through various stages of processing  validation which cost some CPU, before finally reaching the end of the pipe where the processed message is sent to the outside world via an HttpClient. p  pMy implementation is not waiting on a message to be fully processed before dequeuing the next one from the queue. Indeed, my message pump, dequeuing messages from the queue, is very simple and immediately forwards the message to be able to dequeue the next one. The simplified code looks like this ommiting exception management, cancellation ... p  precodewhile true      var message  await this.queue.ReceiveNextMessageAsync     this.DeserializeDispatchMessageAsync   private async void DeserializeDispatchMessageAsync       Immediately yield to avoid blocking the asynchronous messaging pump      while deserializing the body which would otherwise impact the throughput.     await Task.Yield      this.messageDispatcher.DispatchAsyncmessage.ForgetSafely  codepre  pThe codeReceiveNextMessageAsynccode is a custom method using a codeTaskCompletionSourcecode as .NET codeMessageQueuecode was not offerred any async method in .NET Framework 4.5. So I am just using codeBeginReceivecode  codeEndReceivecode couple with a codeTaskCompletionSourcecode.p  pThis is one of the only places in my code where I dont await on an async method. The loop dequeues as fast as it can do. It does not even wait on the message deserialization message deserialization is lazily done by .NET FCL implementation of Message, when accessing the Body property explicitely. I do a Task.Yield immediately to fork the deserializationmessage proccessing to another task and immediately free the loop.p  pRight now, in the context of my benches, as I was saying previsouly, all IOs DB access only are faked. All calls to async methods to get data from the DB just return a Task.FromResult with fake data. There is something arround 20 DB calls during the processing of a message and they are all faked right now  synchronous. The only asynchrony point is at the end of the processing of a message, where it gets send via HttpClient. HttpClient sending is faked as well, but I am doing a random 050ms await Task.Delay at this point. Anyway, due to the faking of the DB, each message processing can be seen as a single Task.p  pFor my benchs I am storing approx 300K messages in the queue then I launch the server app. It dequeues quite fast, flooding the server app and all messages are processed concurrently. Thats why I dont understand why I do not reach 100 CPU and 4 cores, but only 75 and 3 cores used synchronization concerns aside.p  pWhen I only dequeue without doing any deserialization nor processing on messages commenting out the call to codeDeserializeDispatchMessageAsynccode I reach a throughput of approx 20K messages  sec. When I do the whole processing, I reach a throuhgput of approx 10K messages  sec.p  pThe fact that messages are dequeued fast from the queue and that message deserialization  processing is done in a separate task makes me visualize in my head a lot of Tasks one per message being queued on the Task Scheduler Thread Pool here ... no synchronization context, so I would expect that the thread pool would dispatch all these messages  to the max number of cores and all 4 cores fully busy for processing of all tasks, but I doesnt seem to be this way.p  pAnyway, any answer is welcome, I am looking for any ideatips.p
Negative 60010 pIm trying to redirect the output of printf functions to a file on Windows. Im using ctypes with python3 to invoke the functions.

I read all the redirection threads here on StackOverflow and I cant understand whats going on.   Anyway, what Ive gathered is that C functions access the stdout that is bind directly to the file descriptor, while python uses a special object for that  stdout File Object. So the elementary sys.stdoutemsomethingem doesnt work with ctypes.   Ive even tried os.fdopen1 on the dup2ed output and then calling flush after every printf statement but this aint working again.  Im totally out of ideas now and would appreciate if someone have a solution for this.p

Negative 60010 pon the weekend I started to build my first android app. As I need to ask the user of my app for user credentials [which are used for further webservice usage] I want to simulate a login system. On the start of my app the user should be told to enter his credentials. When the user is inactive for too long I want to dismiss the entered credentials and to log out the user. While coding and afterwards while testing I realized that the way I thought I could go doesnt work. After reading the docu and several SOquestions again and again I question myself more and more if I have understand the app  activity life cycle and its possibilites fully. So I wanted to ask for help in understand the life cycle and its linked influences on my app. So yes this might be several questions in one p  pFor the moment my app consists of the following activitiesp  ul lia search activity which is opened once the app is startedli lia settings acitivy which can be accessed from the search dialog and has a link back to the search dialogli ul  pAfter the user has entered an ID in the search dialog I want to open an activity regarding to the search result NYI. p  pWhen starting to implement the user auth, my idea was the following Everytime codeonResumecode of an activity is called I need to check a if user credentials are already stored and b if the last action of the user is less then X minutes ago. If one these fails I want to show a log in panel where the user can enter his credentials, which are then stored in the SharedPreferences. For that I did the followingp  pI first build an parent activity which has the check and a reference for the SharedPreferences in itp  precodepublic class AppFragmentActivity extends FragmentActivity      protected SharedPreferences sharedPref   protected SharedPreferences.Editor editor        protected String WebServiceUsername   protected String WebServicePassword     Override   protected void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState      super.onCreatesavedInstanceState     setContentViewR.layout.activityappfragmentactivity          Override   protected void onResume       super.onResume        Check if user is logged in.      Meaning Are there given user credentials and are they valid of was the user inactive for too long       We only do this onResume because this callback is the only one, which is called everytime an user       startsrestartsresumes an application     checkForUserCredentials        Set new last action now now     setLastActionnew Date.getTime       Override   protected void onStart        Fill content     super.onStart       Set global sharedPreferences     sharedPref  this.getSharedPreferencesgetStringR.string.FILEsettingsfile, Context.MODEPRIVATE               Checks if user credentials are valid meaning if they are set and not too old       private void checkForUserCredentials         long TimeLastAction  sharedPref.getLonggetStringR.string.SETTINGSUSERLASTACTION, 0     long TimeNow  new Date.getTime       Ask for User credentials when last action is too long ago     ifTimeLastAction lt TimeNow  1800         Inactive for too long        Set back credentials        setUsernameAndPassword,            else            WebServiceUsername  sharedPref.getStringgetStringR.string.SETTINGSUSERUSERNAME,        WebServicePassword  sharedPref.getStringgetStringR.string.SETTINGSUSERPASSWORD,                                   Saves the given last action in the sharedPreferences     param long LastAction  Time of the last action       private void setLastActionlong LastAction      editor  sharedPref.edit     editor.putLonggetStringR.string.SETTINGSUSERLASTACTION, LastAction     editor.commit                    Saves the given username and userpassword sharedPreferences     param String username     param String password       private void setUsernameAndPasswordString username, String password      editor  sharedPref.edit     editor.putStringgetStringR.string.SETTINGSUSERUSERNAME, username     editor.putStringgetStringR.string.SETTINGSUSERPASSWORD, password     editor.commit          WebServiceUsername  username     WebServicePassword  password            Method called when pressing the OKButton         public void ClickBtnOKView view           Save UserCreentials        EditText dfsUsername  EditText findViewByIdR.id.dfsUsername       String lvsUsername  dfsUsername.getText.toString                EditText dfsPassword  EditText findViewByIdR.id.dfsPassword       String lvsPassword  dfsPassword.getText.toString                iflvsUsername.equals  lvsPassword.equals          TextView txtError  TextView findViewByIdR.id.txtError         txtError.setTextgetStringR.string.ERRNameorPasswordempty              else                 Save credentials         setUsernameAndPasswordlvsUsername, lvsPassword         setLastActionnew Date.getTime           open Searchactivity           Intent intent  new Intentthis, SearchActivity.class           startActivityintent                                   codepre  pThe log in mask is codesetContentViewR.layout.activityappfragmentactivitycode.p  pThe two other activites I created are then extending this parent class. This is one of itp  precodepublic class SearchActivity extends AppFragmentActivity    SearchFragment searchfragment    Override   protected void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState      super.onCreatesavedInstanceState     setContentViewR.layout.activitysearch       Override   protected void onResume      super.onResume      ifWebServiceUsername.equals ampamp WebServicePassword.equals         Username not set. Relogin.       Intent intent  new Intentthis, AppFragmentActivity.class       startActivityintent                        Override   protected void onStart      super.onStart        ...    codepre  pAs far as I understand the lifecycle now this should work as the following When my app starts the codeSearchActivitycode is set for codeLAUNCHcode the app should step into the codeonResumecode of my parent class. There it sees that the credentials are not yet stored and opens the layout of the codeAppFragmentActivitycode which is the login. When entered, the user is redirected to the codeSearchActivitycode which now sees ok credentials are there, lets move forward. But this doesntt happen as the login is not shown up. So I think my codeonResumecode might be wrong. Perhaps my full idea is bad Up to here I thought I also understand the life cycle, but obviosly I dontp  pI then had a look around on SO for similar problems. One thing I saw here was a comment to an user which wanted to build a similar logout mechanism as mine, that he has to implement this in every activity. I thought about that and ask myself Why do I have to override the codeonResumecode in every of my activites, when they are all from the same parent When theres no codeonResumecode in the child, the one of the parent should be called. The user in the SOquestion was advised to use services as background threads to count down a timer in there for the logout. I then read the services article in the docu and then fully got disorientedp  pThere are two types of services Started and bounded ones. A started service is once started by an activity and then runs in the background until hell freezes when it doesnt get stoped. So its fully independed of any app, but the programmer has to  should stop it when its not longer needed. A bounded services is bounded to one or many app components and stops when all bounded components end. I thought this might be a good alternative for me, but when I thought further I ask myself how If one of my starts it lets say the login dialog and then is closed the service is stoped and the other activites always start there own ones which cant be the sense of it. So this service must be bounded not to any component but to my app. But whats the life cycle of an android app How can I keep information global inside my app. I know I can switch data between actitivites using Intents.p  pThis more and more foggy cloud lead to ask myself Shall I use only one activity and try to switch inout everything using fragmentsp  pSo my questions are I think thats all of them, but Im not sure anymorep  ul liDoes my idea of writing an parent class which does the checks for all extended childs ok or bad AND does it work as I understood itli liDo I have to override every codeonResumecode in the childs just to call the parent one for the checksli liCan you give me a tip why my login systems doesnt workli liWhats the life cycle of an android app and how can I interact with itli liShall I only use one activity and switch inout everything using fragments or is it a good way to have several activities and some of them use fragments to reuse often used partsli ul  pThanks in advisep

Negative 60010 pBy default, CodeIgniter blocks 27  from appearing in URLs. I have commented out the entire config[permittedurichars] directive as a result.

Negative 60010 pIm working on a source editor for C and came up with simple optimization that I do not need to invalidate e.g. highlighting, rebuild AST, do static analysis the code before the currently edited statement basically, before the previous semicolonclosing brace but I am not sure if this is always true for C.p  pE.g. in Java it is possible to call functions declareddefined after the edit location. Hence, if the user adds an argument to the function then error marker should be placed in the code before the edit location. In C function should be declared before it is used and if the declaration does not match definition the error will be on definition.p

Negative 60010 pive started to get my hands on mocking frameworks because I want to write some unit tests for methods which indirectly write something to a database. Heres a small example of the classes structurep  precodeclass SomePersistenceClass      public void Persistobject value, string type              if type.EqualsNumeric                      PersistNumeric intvalue                     private void PersistNumericint number              Some Calculations and Creation of DBObject         number         var dbObject  new DatabaseObject DbObjectData  new DatabaseObjectData Number  number, Creator  John Doe         PersistImpldbObject           private void PersistImplIDatabaseObject dbObject              try                      dbObject.Save                  catch Exception                      ErrorHandling             throw                 interface IDatabaseObject      DatabaseObjectData DbObjectData  get set      void Save   class DatabaseObject  IDatabaseObject      public DatabaseObjectData DbObjectData  get set       public void Save              Save to Database        class DatabaseObjectData      public int Number  get set      public string Text  get set      public string Creator  get set   codepre  pWhat I want to do now, is test the public persist method. The problem here is, that my DatabaseObject will save the data to an database. It would be easy to mock the DatabaseObjects save method, but Im not sure whats the best way to inject the mocked object as you can see, I dont have any knowledge of the DatabaseObject in my public method into the PersistImpl method. One thougt was to pull up the DatabaseObject creation to the public method. So something like thisp  precode    public void Persistobject value, string type, IDatabaseObject dbObject              if type.EqualsNumeric                      PersistNumeric intvalue, dbObject                     private void PersistNumericint number, IDatabaseObject dbObject              Some Calculations and Creation of DBObject         number         dbObject.DbObjectData.Number  number         dbObject.DbObjectData.Creator  John Doe         PersistImpldbObject      codepre  pBut Im quite unhappy with this soultion. I would need to create the database object outside the persistence class.p  pIs there are good way to solve such a problem I definitly have to remove the database access within my unit tests.p
Negative 60010 pI have multiple codeArrayListltStringgtcodes linked into a custom adapter Im using to build a list view. Now suppose they are just two in total, to simplify. I want to sort one of them and then have this new order reflected into the other one, in order to maintain the list consistent.p  pThis is what I was thinking to do and doesnt work, ending with an codeIndexOutOfBoundsException Invalid index 0, size is 0code at the line signed with codecode.p  precode initial declarations ListltStringgt filenameEntries  new ArrayListltStringgt ListltStringgt idEntries  new ArrayListltStringgt   various operations that fill the two ArrayList here...    sorting ListltStringgt oldFilenameEntries  new ArrayListltStringgt ListltStringgt oldIdEntries  new ArrayListltStringgt  oldFilenameEntries  filenameEntries oldIdEntries  idEntries  idEntries.clear  Collections.sortfilenameEntries  for int i  0 i lt filenameEntries.size i       for int j  0 j lt oldFilenameEntries.size j           if oldFilenameEntries.getj  filenameEntries.geti              idEntries.addoldIdEntries.getj                   codepre  pMy idea was to search into the old ArrayList for every element from the new one, and then use this old index to repolulate the other ArrayList. p  pI have the restriction that the other sorted ArrayList must be again codeidEntriescode. This is way I did this sort of transferp  pAny suggestion Thanks.p  pstrongEDITstrong I thought it was a sorting issue and then came out I missed the right way to make a copy for the ArrayLists. Thanks to everyone that pointed out that the error was atp  precodeoldFilenameEntries  filenameEntries oldIdEntries  idEntries codepre  pand why. p  pI accepted the answer that pointed me more quickly to the solution.

Negative 60010 pSo in the past few months Ive taught myself web design.  Of course theres a ton more to learn, but I feel that I have a firm grasp on what I know so far.  One thing that Ive wondered about recently is how necessary the div is, especially when I end up using absolute positioning.  For instance I recently I wrote the following codep  precodeltsection idheadersectiongt         ltheader classmainheadergt             lth1gtThe Voice of Jeremy Donahuelth1gt                 ltnav classmainnavigationgt                     ltulgt                         ltligtlta hrefhttpwww.thevoiceofjeremydonahue.comaboutgtAboutltagtltligt                         ltligtlta hrefhttpwww.thevoiceofjeremydonahue.comcontactgtContactltagtltligt                     ltulgt                 ltnavgt         ltheadergt ltsectiongt  codepre  pWhen I read the source code on a lot of pages it seems to me that things are generally grouped like this or very similar.  Of course my assumption is, as a designer you have artistic license and can arrange your page anyway that you want, while keeping the user experience in mind and keeping your code semantic.p  pHowever, many times I end up positioning my elements using the position absolute property and completely disregarding the containing div.  So my thought is if I have an H1 for example and I plan on positioning it as Ive described, then why even bother putting it in a div, and the same for any other element that I position it such a way.  Why not have them as free standing elements  Im wondering if its still good to do so for semantic reasons, or if its just considered best practice to group things this way.  I hope that Ive been clear in the way that Ive described this.p  pJust to be as descriptive as I can, here is the css that Ive applied so far to this particular iteration of this page.  Its no where close to finished obviously, but you can see a couple of the absolute positioning that Ive applied to this header section.p  precodeglobal        webkitboxsizing borderbox        mozboxsizing borderbox          oboxsizing borderbox             boxsizing borderbox   html      height 100   body      background rgb234, 234, 234   body, .container      minheight 100   .container      background white     margintop 6.25em   header      position absolute     top 0.625rem     background transparent     textalign center    ul      liststyletype none   a      textdecoration none   typography  h1      fontfamily Parisienne, cursive     fontsize 2.5rem     color 2713e7     position relative     top 1.25rem    lists  .mainnavigation      position relative     top 2.5rem   .mainnavigation li       position absolute     top 10px     display inlineblock     marginright 10     fontfamily Atomic Age, cursive     fontsize 1.5625rem    borders  .mainnavigation      border 2px solid black   .mainnavigation li       display inlineblock     border 2px solid black    codepre

Negative 60010 pI am working on a RESTfull application which requires high scalability. I am considering Netty based frameworks for RESTfull applications. I went through some of the available options and tried to get what they can offer as a nonblocking implementation. Here are my findingsp  ol lirest.li  Still under experimental phase for Netty based NIO implementaions. So, not production ready.li liRESTEasy  Standard JBoss project which supports Netty 4.x. But,instead of full stack Netty based NIO implementation, RESTEasy is a Buffer exchange between Netty and RESTEasy. Its not taking the advantages of Netty. Therefore scalability is not as high as expected from a Netty based framework.li liNettyhttp component  Another  option is Apache Camel integration while using Nettyhttp component as an endpoint for routing requests to services exposed in from of beans. I think its same as RESTEasy, only Nettyhttp component uses Netty based NIO capabilities and the rest of the system would use the old IO. I dont think I would help much in gaining scalabiltiy.li liRESTExpress  It claims to be Netty based framework for RESTFull application. But, neither it has a decent community nor it can be trusted Because its very new for enterprise application which requires high degree of security.li ol  pBefore having the above findings, I wanted to use some ready to use framework and get the work done faster. p  pI know its an opinion based question. But, still I seriously need help for choosing right framework for my application. If in case, there is no Netty based REST framework would it be wise to go for plumbing low level Netty based NIO code in my application Any help appreciated. Thanks in advance. p

Negative 60010 pIn most situations, one would declare a codecharcode object to assign one of the character values on the ascii table ranging from 0  127. Even the extended character sets range from 128  255 still positive. So im assuming that when dealing with the printing of characters, one only needs to use an codeunsigned charcode. p  pNow, based on some research on SO, people use a codesigned charcode when they need to use really small integers, but for that we can utilize the code[u]int8code type. So im having trouble coming to terms with why one would need to use a codesigned charcode  You can use it if you are dealing with the basic character ascii table which codeunsigned charcode is already capable of doing or you can use it to represent small integers which code[u]int8code already takes care of.p  pCan someone please provide a programming example in which a codesigned charcode is preferred over the other types p

Negative 60010 pI have been researching solutions to an issue we are facing. I am using transacitonscope to wrap some looping code the save data to SQL 2005. We have had to revert to using a string and splitting in the proc, so when the string is length  8000 I split it and this is working great on our test env which is SQL 2008R2. The issue is when we move testing to SQL 2005 environment the transaction is automatically enlisted to msdtc. As the 2005 env is different e.g. different domain and behind firewall etc I would like SQL server to handle the transaction rather than msdtc. We have traced the SQL 2005 db and can see the DTC transactions in the trace, when tracing SQL2008 it is only using SQL transactions in the trace.p  pThe code itself is simple   using statement TransactionScope ..., there is a loop within the using block which will probably only loop between 1 and 4 iterations at most and in the loop there is code newing up a sql connection to the same DB, and there is a implicit SQltransaction created off this connection which is there to resolve single updates. I cannot pass the same newed up connection back to itself as the code is in a data access layer, but testing SQL2008 it must be ok with new connections to the same db new as it pooled I believe.  Each loop does the actual update call to the DB. If so if the string is 1200 char length there will be 2 calls to update the db...p  pBased on some SO posts e.g. a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions16854500sqlconnectionandavoidingpromotiontomsdtcSqlConnection and avoiding promotion to MSDTCap  pthere is a setting that can be passed to the connection string Enlistfalse, which from my understanding will keep the management of the transaction to sql server and will work provided you are using the same database resource  in my case  the same sql 2005, with newed up connections including a connection.begintransaction in each loop  can anyone confirm this Or is using the connection setting Enlistfalse dangerous in my casep  pthanksp  pedit  to rephase, is there any caveat with using Enlistfalse in a connection string, when using a transcationscope, sql 2005, and code that looks somewhat like this pseudo code p  precodeusingvar ts  new transactionscope           loop twice                      using var conn  new SqlConnection          using tran   conn.BeginTransaction           do update to the db code here            tran.commit             ts.Complete  codepre

Negative 60010 pI am currently working on some kind of OCR Optical Character Recognition system.

I do not want to rely on a library, because that was not the task given to me.p  pI know this question may seem a bit vague and there are similar questions, but Im looking for the method, not for a package and so far I couldnt find any comments regarding the method. The reason this question being vague is that I really have no point to start. What I want to do is actually described here on wikipediap  pemMatrix matching involves comparing an image to a stored glyph on a pixelbypixel basis it is also known as pattern matching or pattern recognition.[9] This relies on the input glyph being correctly isolated from the rest of the image, and on the stored glyph being in a similar font and at the same scale. This technique works best with typewritten text and does not work well when new fonts are encountered. This is the technique the early physical photocellbased OCR implemented, rather directly.em a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiOpticalcharacterrecognitionCharacterrecognition relnofollowhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiOpticalcharacterrecognitionCharacterrecognitionap  pIf anyone could help me out on this one, I would appreciate it very much.p  pThanks in advance,p  pJefp

Negative 60010 pI have a few classes that inherit the same class with a print method. I also have a custommade dynamic array template class. I have created a few dynamic arrays of pointers to objects from the child classes. For every array I want to have a separate function for calling all the print methods of the objects pointed by the pointers some times I want to print only the weapons, sometimes only the modifications or sometimes everything. So far I have tried two solutions copypasting the first method as shown in the code for every array or converting the dynamic arrays into arrays of pointers to the mother class and passing the new ones as an argument to an universal print function.p  pAnd here is some codep  precode    class Item ...     class Modification  public Item ...     class Equipment  public Item ...      DynamicArrayltModificationgt modification     DynamicArrayltEquipmentgt weapon      The first way     void printModsInfo               if modification.size  0             coutltltNo mods in inventoryn         else             for int i  0 i lt modification.size i                 modification.returnElementigtprintInfo           void printWeaponsInfo               if weapon.size  0             coutltltNo weapons in inventoryn         else             for int i  0 i lt weapon.size i                 weapon.returnElementigtprintInfo           The second way     void printModsInfo               Item tempRef  new Item[modification.size]array of pointers         for int i  0 i lt modification.size iconverting DynamicArrayltModificationgt into Item tempRef             tempRef[i]  modification.returnElementi         printCertainStuffInInventory tempRef, modification.size         delete tempRef           void printWeaponsInfo           Item tempRef  new Item[weapon.size]     for int i  0 i lt weapon.size i         tempRef[i]  weapon.returnElementi     printCertainStuffInInventory tempRef, weapon.size     delete tempRef           void printCertainStuff Item arr, int size              if size  0             coutltltNothing from this type in inventory...n         else             for int i  0 i lt size i                 arr[i]gtprintInfo      codepre  pSo I have two choices copypaste the five rows from the fist way, or copypaste the more complicated five rows from the second way and add five more rows for the printing function. But what I really want to do is to simply pass the dynamic arrays as arguments and make the conversion if needed in the printing function or to simply call the printer by writing codeprintCertainStuffmodificationcode or weapon or whatever. And this is required by the design of the whole project. I did consult my teacher, but the answer was that there is no way to do that without converting before calling the function.p  pBut still is there a way to pass such dynamic arrays as arguments the way I wantp

Negative 60010 pIm trying to interpolate spherical harmonics to a cubic, Cartesian grid. p  pThe output data of my spherical, pseudospectral simulation has codeNrcode radial levels between coderMincode and coderMaxcode, each containing a set of finiteorder spherical harmonics for longitude and latitude.

I have implemented categories in the tabbarcontroller, navcontroller, and various view controllers to override rotation methods, and aside from this one issue, these controllers maintain the supported views.p  pI have created a button on the modal view controller that unwinds to the previous controller. When I press this button while in landscape, it unwinds to the previous, but in landscape, although the viewcontrollers preferredsupported orientation is portrait. p  pstrongI would like to perform this unwind segue while not allowing it to display the controller as landscape segues back to portrait.

They provide schema ttl file, instances ttl file, ... files respectively, but i wanna see the whole thing at once.p  pShould I get yago2s owl file or is there any ways to see yago ttl files like dbpedia owlp  pThanks in advance. p  pThe error message when I tried to open yagoTypes.ttl file isp  pjava.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetExceptionp  precodeat org.eclipse.jface.operation.ModalContext.runModalContext.java421 at org.eclipse.jface.dialogs.ProgressMonitorDialog.runProgressMonitorDialog.java507 at org.eclipse.ui.internal.progress.ProgressMonitorJobsDialog.runProgressMonitorJobsDialog.java275 at org.eclipse.ui.internal.progress.ProgressManager3.runProgressManager.java960 at org.eclipse.swt.custom.BusyIndicator.showWhileBusyIndicator.java70 at org.eclipse.ui.internal.progress.ProgressManager.busyCursorWhileProgressManager.java995 at org.eclipse.ui.internal.progress.ProgressManager.busyCursorWhileProgressManager.java970 at org.topbraidcomposer.core.io.TBCIO3.runTBCIO.java501 at org.eclipse.swt.widgets.RunnableLock.runRunnableLock.java35 at org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Synchronizer.runAsyncMessagesSynchronizer.java135 at org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Display.runAsyncMessagesDisplay.java4145 at org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Display.readAndDispatchDisplay.java3762 at org.eclipse.e4.ui.internal.workbench.swt.PartRenderingEngine9.runPartRenderingEngine.java1113 at org.eclipse.core.databinding.observable.Realm.runWithDefaultRealm.java332 at org.eclipse.e4.ui.internal.workbench.swt.PartRenderingEngine.runPartRenderingEngine.java997 at org.eclipse.e4.ui.internal.workbench.E4Workbench.createAndRunUIE4Workbench.java140 at org.eclipse.ui.internal.Workbench5.runWorkbench.java611 at org.eclipse.core.databinding.observable.Realm.runWithDefaultRealm.java332 at org.eclipse.ui.internal.Workbench.createAndRunWorkbenchWorkbench.java567 at org.eclipse.ui.PlatformUI.createAndRunWorkbenchPlatformUI.java150 at org.eclipse.ui.internal.ide.application.IDEApplication.startIDEApplication.java124 at org.eclipse.equinox.internal.app.EclipseAppHandle.runEclipseAppHandle.java196 at org.eclipse.core.runtime.internal.adaptor.EclipseAppLauncher.runApplicationEclipseAppLauncher.java110 at org.eclipse.core.runtime.internal.adaptor.EclipseAppLauncher.startEclipseAppLauncher.java79 at org.eclipse.core.runtime.adaptor.EclipseStarter.runEclipseStarter.java354 at org.eclipse.core.runtime.adaptor.EclipseStarter.runEclipseStarter.java181 at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0Native Method at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invokeUnknown Source at sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invokeUnknown Source at java.lang.reflect.Method.invokeUnknown Source at org.eclipse.equinox.launcher.Main.invokeFrameworkMain.java636 at org.eclipse.equinox.launcher.Main.basicRunMain.java591 at org.eclipse.equinox.launcher.Main.runMain.java1450 at org.eclipse.equinox.launcher.Main.mainMain.java1426 codepre  pCaused by java.lang.NullPointerExceptionp  precodeat org.topbraid.core.model.Classes.getMetaClassesClasses.java548 at org.topbraid.core.model.Classes.computeMetaClassesClasses.java45 at org.topbraidcomposer.core.session.AbstractSessionWithCache.getCachedMetaClassesAbstractSessionWithCache.java67 at org.topbraid.core.model.Classes.getMetaClassesClasses.java166 at org.topbraidcomposer.editors.ResourceEditorLauncher.checkVisibilityResourceEditorLauncher.java270 at org.topbraidcomposer.editors.ResourceEditorLauncher.access4ResourceEditorLauncher.java269 at org.topbraidcomposer.editors.ResourceEditorLauncher5.runResourceEditorLauncher.java577 at org.topbraidcomposer.core.io.TBCIO2.runTBCIO.java482 at org.eclipse.jface.operation.ModalContextModalContextThread.runModalContext.java121 codepre  pand this same error occurs when I concatenate yagoTypes.ttl and yagoFacts.ttl using cat command, and try to open this concatenated file..p
Negative 60010 pI am currently developing a number of Kooboo modules which receive frequent updates.

Negative 60010 pSo a situation came up at work and I wanted to discuss it here because we could not get to an agreement between usp  pWe have two models, codeOrdercode and codePassportcode, which are related in a way that an Order hasone passport and a passport hasmany orders. Whenever an order is completed, its associated passport must be locked, that is, turned into readonly that information was already used to clear customs, so it cant be changed afterwards. We want to enforce that rule in the codePassportcode model and weve thought of the following optionsp  ol listrongCreating a validationstrong. CONS There will be records yielding codevalid gt falsecode when technically the record is fine although it cant be saved. For example, if other records have a codevalidatesassociated passportcode on them, that could be a problem.li listrongOverriding the codereadonlycode methodstrong. CONS This will raise an exception when trying to update that record, although you would expect that calling a codesavecode method wont ever raise one.li listrongCreating a codebeforesavecode callbackstrong. This has two flavors either raise an exception which is pretty much like the codereadonlycode option or add an codeerrorcode and return codefalsecode to stop the callback chain. CONS Adding validation errors from outside a proper validation can be considered a bad practice. Also, you might find yourself calling codevalidcode and getting codetruecode and then call codesavecode and get codefalsecode.li ol  pThis situation made us think a lot about the relationship between validations and Rails. What exactly does it mean for a record to be codevalidcode Does it imply that the codesavecode will workp  pI would like to listen to your opinions to learn about this scenario. Maybe the best approach is neither one of the three Thanksp

Which, actually rewrite or overwrite the erb file to match the new updates.p  pThis worked very well on development environment, while did not work on Heroku as production, because Heroku platform is using an ephemeral writing filesystem. This means that every time you deploy, restart or scale updown the dynos in your app, youre getting a new clean filesystem based on the content of your repository, and updating templates within the app is not going to work.p  pSo, strongwhat are alternative solutionsstrong if you have a good gem to be used and works with heroku. Or, how can I save mail template in S3 storage and call it again when sending emails or in editing. Or, how to save the template in database model and render them again in views to be reedited or while sending the mails.p  pThank you and waiting your feedbackp

Negative 60010 pIm currently trying to learn openGL and Im sort of stuck making a very easy lighting engine for my application. Its 2D and most sources I find only cover rather complicated 3D operations. What I want to do is something as simple as what is covered in this tutorial a hrefhttpwww.alcovegames.comopengles2tutorialslightmapshaderfireeffectglsl relnofollowhttpwww.alcovegames.comopengles2tutorialslightmapshaderfireeffectglslap  pIt nudged me in the right direction and I am to understand that Im to use a framebuffer with sort of a light map that I send to my shaders along with the texture Im rendering so I can combine these values to create a lighting effect. First things first I cant get my framebuffer to workp  pI followed the following tutorial a hrefhttpopen.glframebuffers relnofollowhttpopen.glframebuffersa which was neat enough. It lead me to the following code for very simply creating a framebufferp  precodeGLuint frameBuffer glGenFramebuffers1, ampframeBuffer  glBindFramebufferGLFRAMEBUFFER, frameBuffer glFramebufferTexture2D GLFRAMEBUFFER, GLCOLORATTACHMENT0, GLTEXTURE2D, myTexture2.textureid, 0 codepre  phere myTexture2 is my texture class and the textureid is the GLuint for this texture. I can render this to the screen easily enough using the default frame buffer and it displays fine so I know this works. After I do this, I run the test to check if everything is fine as the tutorial mentionsp  precode    GLenum checkframebuffer  glCheckFramebufferStatusframeBuffer     if checkframebuffer  GLFRAMEBUFFERCOMPLETE              stdcout ltlt Everything is finen          else         stdcout ltlt glCheckFramebufferStatus returned  ltlt glCheckFramebufferStatusframeBuffer ltlt stdendl         stdcout ltlt GlError  ltlt glGetError ltlt stdendl      codepre  pglCheckFramebufferStatus returns 0, with the GLerror 1280 invalid enum. p  pNonsurprisingly, if I bind to this framebuffer before drawing, everything is just black with the glClearColor set to red, so at the very least if it was working it should be red. If I set it back top  precodeglBindFramebufferGLFRAMEBUFFER, 0 codepre  pThen everything runs fine. What is wrong with my framebuffer Ive been searching everywhere for a simple project example that I could just copypaste and run to see that it works but its either the wrong language or uses some library Im not intending to. Furthermore, Im not entirely certain Im understanding how the framebuffer works. Im understanding that its just another screen to draw to or as I understand, adding another step in the rendering process. p  pCurrently Im drawing everything by binding a texture, drawing a quad with the texture size, then moving on to the next texture. This means that for every single image in my application, they all run one shader each or should I say, copies of the exact same shader currently. Am I to understand that if I have for example 20 different images running 20 shaders on screen first, I can then run these through an extra step to mix them with the light map I create in the framebuffer, or am I mistakenp  pSorry if these questions sound dumb, but Ive been browsing through tons of tutorials right now and each one is raising more questions than it seems to answer, I generally learn best by experimenting but when I cant even get my framebuffer going, Im sort of stuckp

Negative 60010 pMy app has a screen with an expandablelistview. Within the expandablelistview are collapsible rows that contain listviews. These listviews contain a dynamic number of items and with dynamic heights on each item. As listviews are meant to be set to a hardcoded height and then to have scrolling within them, and I dont want to have scrolling within scrolling, Ive had to get around that by calculating the actual height of the listviews items then set the height of the listview to that height so that all of its contents will fit within the exandablelistview row.p  pHere is my extension method that calculates the listviews heightp  precodepublic static void SetHeightBasedOnChildrenthis ListView listView              var listAdapter  listView.Adapter              var totalHeight  listView.PaddingTop  listView.PaddingBottom             if listView.DividerHeight gt 0                 totalHeight  listView.DividerHeight  listAdapter.Count  1              var desiredWidth  DeviceHelper.GetDimensions .X Add parameter if listview doesnt always span entire width of screen             var listViewWidth  MeasureSpec.MakeMeasureSpec desiredWidth, MeasureSpecMode.AtMost             View listItem             for int i  0 i lt listAdapter.Count i                  listItem  listAdapter.GetView i, null, listView                 if listItem is ViewGroup ampamp listItem.LayoutParameters  null                     listItem.LayoutParameters  new ViewGroup.LayoutParamsViewGroup.LayoutParams.WrapContent, ViewGroup.LayoutParams.WrapContent                 listItem.Measure listViewWidth, intMeasureSpecMode.Unspecified                 totalHeight  listItem.MeasuredHeight                           var layoutParams  listView.LayoutParameters             layoutParams.Height  totalHeight             listView.LayoutParameters  layoutParams          codepre  pThe issue with this is that when scrolling down the screen and reaching each listview, as it calculates the dynamic height of the listviews items and sets its height to that, it causes the scrolling to get really choppy.p  pAs I mentioned that listviews are meant to be a hardcoded height, I tried swapping out our listviews for linearlayouts with vertical orientation, which are meant to have an adjustable height that fit their content so dont need any fancy height calculations on the fly. Unfortunately this approach didnt work, as linearlayouts dont cache their rows like listviews do, so the screen was completely unusable from trying to manage hundreds  thousands of rows without any sort of caching. Note the linearlayouts performed fine on the emulator but not on devices.p  pIm wondering if anyone has ideas of how to get smooth scrolling in this situation. Some ideas I had...p  ol lipKeep using listviews but set a hardcoded height on each item in the listview. Then I can calculate the height of the listview much faster, as I know the height based on the total number of rows. I would still have to set the height on each listview though, which makes it still not smooth but better than before. The downside is that Id either need to make all rows tall enough to fit longer content waste of vertical space, or truncate content that doesnt fit.pli lipLook into if anyone has developed a hybrid widget, that is a linearlayout with vertical orientation that utilizes row caching.pli lipFigure out how to force the expandablelistview to load the listview sections immediately on screen load rather than waiting until theyre just about to come into view. The downside is were holding a lot more in memory so this might render the screen unusable.pli ol  pThoughtsp  pEDIT I should probably mention that the listviews are also within viewpagers, as the user can swipe between lists from different years think tax records or mortgage records for a property. I bring this up so someone wont say, just dont have listviews at all, just only use the expandablelistview.p

So far, my understanding is as followsp  precode1 bt  sinApit is the base note of the chord at frequency A. 2 Tt  sin54piAt is the major third of the base bt. 3 Dt  sin32piAt is the dominant fifth of the base bt. 4 At  sin2Apit is the octave. codepre  pEach one alone is a separate frequency which is easy for a computer generator to sound. However, the major chord of the note with frequency A is as followsp  pMajor Chord  bTDAp  pI was wondering if anyone has a way to make a computer synthesizer play this function so I can hear the result most programs I have found only take Hz as an input, an while this function has a wavelength, its different from the simple sine wave with the same wavelength.p  pNote will post this in the physics and music sections as well  just wondering if you computer scientists know something about this.p

Negative 60010 pstrongWhat I am trying to dostrong I am currently hosting an OpenTK glControl through a codeWindowsFormsHostcode in my WPF application. The application has many buttons, but we will focus on the pause and play buttons. I use VBOs and this is how I animate codeGL.DrawArraysPrimitiveType.LineStrip, 0, frameCount code. It is drawing the range of vertices from 0 to codeframecountcode, so when I hit play, it just starts incrementing codeframecountcode, which starts animating. When just using a mouse, everything works perfectly.p  pstrongThe Problemstrong My app needs to work with a touch screen also FWIW, when I say touch, WPF is seeing it as a stylus, not touch. When the app is NOT animating, touch works like it should, I dont handle touch events so touching buttons just raised the codeClickcode event. If we arent animating, I dont have any problems. So when I use my mouse codeClickcode the play button, the UI still responds to my Mouse clicks work, hovering changes colors as it should, etc, but then touches seemingly get ignored for some period of time. I have to touch a button 3 to 5 times before it does what it is supposed to like pause. Lets go back and now we arent animating, this time, if I TOUCH the play button to raise the codeClickcode event, it will start animating, but my touches now have the same problem of having to touch multiple times to raise codeClickcode event, and on top of that, the UI now does not respond to the mouse the WindowsFormsHost still reacts to mouse events properly. Clicking on buttons or hovering over buttons doesnt do anything. It is not until I can get the animation to pause again that the UI starts responding to Mouse again.p  pstrongWhat I have tried and what I think I knowstrong When the UI stops responding to mouse input and touch input is messsed up, if I use MOUSE or TOUCH to click anywhere outside of my app, it works as expected. This leads me to believe it is not a touch screen driver problem or anything. I also used Snoop to see what events were being raised or not to see the stylus and the mouse being captured and released and what has focus.  I could not find an instance where one was not released.  If anyone would like, I can post Snoop results showing differences between mouse and touch clicking. I tried putting a preview mouse down on the MainWindow, but after TOUCHING play, no Mouse clicks raise this event, and the first touch after touching the play button touches randomly will fire this event. I also tried hiding the WindowsFormsHost, and mouse and touch clicks all work like they should minus the glControl. Because I hide the WindowsFormsHost, the paint event never gets fired, leading me to believe there might a problem with the paint function. I am aware of this bug a hrefhttpsconnect.microsoft.comVisualStudiofeedbackdetails782456wpftoucheventfireswithdelay relnofollowWPF Touch Buga, however I dont really think that this is my problem.

But it still happens no matter what order the code is in.p  pSpecifically what I need is either for someone to point out a mistake I overlooked or give me some pointers on how to make the page stay on the first tab when it loads.p  pI have included my html and js controls here, but I also made a fiddle with the full code at a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netjccarter1990o15e98ts3 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netjccarter1990o15e98ts3ap  pThanks in advancep  pdiv classsnippet datalangjs datahidefalse div classsnippetcode pre classsnippetcodehtml langhtml prettyprintoverridecodeltul classnav navpills roletablist idmyTabgt ltli rolepresentation classactivegtlta hrefpageone roletab datatoggletabgtCover Letterltagtltligt ltli rolepresentationgtlta hrefpagetwo roletab datatoggletabgtFeaturesltagtltligt ltli rolepresentationgtlta hrefpagethree roletab datatoggletabgtGalleryltagtltligt ltulgt  ltdiv classtabcontentgt  ltdiv roletabpanel classtabpane active  idpageonegtCover Letterltdivgt    ltdiv roletabpanel classtabpane  idpagetwogtFeaturesltdivgt    ltdiv roletabpanel classtabpane  idpagethreegt   ltdiv classmasonry jsmasonry gt   ltdiv classitemgtltimg classthumbnail srcimgpaigeJohnLasVegas.jpggtltdivgt   ltdiv classitemgtltimg classthumbnail srcimgengagementsCloseUp.jpggtltdivgt   ltdiv classitemgtltimg classthumbnail srcimgjimmyJohns.jpggtltdivgt   ltdiv classitemgtltimg classthumbnail srcimgpaigeNinjaTurtle.jpggtltdivgt   ltdiv classitemgtltimg classthumbnail srcimgsprayPaintSid.jpggtltdivgt     ltdivgt     ltdivgtcodepre div div p  pdiv classsnippet datalangjs datahidefalse div classsnippetcode pre classsnippetcodejs langjs prettyprintoverridecodeltscriptgt var container  document.querySelector.masonry var msnry  initialize Masonry after all images have loaded imagesLoaded container, function  msnry  new Masonry container   var container  document.querySelector.masonry var msnry  new Masonry container,     options   columnWidth 200,   itemSelector .masonry.item   myTab a.clickfunction e  e.preventDefault this.tabshow   function   myTab a[hrefpageone].tabshow myTab a[hrefpagetwo].tabshow myTab a[hrefpagethree].tabshow    ltscriptgtcodepre div div p

Negative 60010 pI am doing POJO serialization  deserialization using Jackson.

Since I am using Jackson fasterxml both to read from the file and to write to the database, I can not find a way to do so, except by creating a new class with the same fields or inheritance and fill them one by one. Basically, I would like to find a way to put 2 JsonProperty annotations on codeproductIdcode.p

Negative 60010 pSo Im writing an RLE compressor, and basically, you take the runs of a file the continuous strings of the same byte and convert it to a packet. For example, if the file contains 0xFF 0xFF 0xFF 0xFF 0xBB 0xBB 0xBB you would convert it into packets, containing a length and the data It would turn out 0x04FF 0x03BB. You get the idea.p  pI use a structure to define the packet. byte is a typedefd type for an unsigned 8 bit typep  precodetypedef struct       Each packet has a length and a data byte       byte length     how many elements of data there is      byte data       whatever byte is being repeated   PACKET codepre  pand I have my writeData functionp  precodevoid writeDataFILE f, int offset, PACKET p       fseekf,offset,SEEKSET  move to the offset to write      fwriteampp,sizeofPACKET,sizeofPACKET,f  write the packet to the given offset   codepre  pAnd here is the code that calls the functionp  precode    offsetCounter  0x0             reset offset counter      fori  0 i lt nPackets i  nPackets is the total amount of packets created               writeDatafDest,offsetCounter,packet[i]         printfWrote d0xX to 0xXn,packet[i].length,packet[i].data,offsetCounter         offsetCounter  0x02       skip 2 bytes to write the next packet       codepre  pWhen I run the program, everything works fine, and the packets are written to the file correctly, except for some reason, at the very end of the file, there are 2 0x00 bytes that are automatically added on. So, for some reason, it just adds 2 extra empty bytes.p  pstrongemHowever,emstrong when I write the writeData function like thisp  precodevoid writeDataFILE f, int offset, PACKET p       fseekf,offset,SEEKSET     fwriteampp.length,sizeofbyte,sizeofbyte,f     fwriteampp.data,sizeofbyte,sizeofbyte,f  codepre  p, which writes each byte of the structure separately, it no longer adds 2 extra empty bytes to the end of the file..p  pIm really confused as to why when I write the structure, it works fine, but adds 2 extra bytes at the end, but when I write each element of the structure separately, it doesnt add them.p  pCould somebody help me figure this outp
Negative 60010 pIm trying to build a google app engine application using java and eclipse which makes use of an external library. I have been having some issues with serializing a particular class which I need to save, so I downloaded the source for the library and added it as its own project in eclipse and linked the project Im working on to it as well as a test applicationstandard java app. p  pTo solve my issue I set the class I need to serialize to implement serializable, and this is where the weird behavior starts. From the test application, with this change, I am now able to serialize the class to a binary array, yet in the app engine project I keep getting a class not serializable error. To get round this I implemented the serializing method as part of the class I need to serialize. Once again this works well from the test project, but when I try to run it from the app engine project copy and pasting the code to make sure there are no changes, I am getting a java.lang.NoSuchMethodError error. It is also worth noting that the ide itself does not show any errors in the code.p  pAnyone ever ran into something similar and has a clue what to do, as I honestly have no idea what to check, and I cant seem to find any solutions to such an issue.p  pThanks in advance for any help.   p

Negative 60010 pI am taking a course that has me creating a basic wiki.  Im definitely new to this.  I need to restrict users from simply typing in a wiki id that they want to view directly in the URL example wikis5.  The only people who should be able to view a wiki should be the wiki owner, an admin or a collaborator on that wiki.p  pI have successfully restricted the index view so that a signed in user only sees their own wiki, a public wiki or a wiki they collaborate on.p  pI have tried to implement similar code in my WikiPolicy, but it isnt working and I cant seem to find a solution.  The code I have now simply will show the wiki if the user is logged in.

Negative 60010 pI am doing performance tests on an algorithm I wrote for parallel matrix multiplication in Java. I get the number of cpu cores from runtime, then divide the calculation loop between the available cores, using a thread pool. I measure the run times of the sequential and parallel version, then display the results in an excel chart. There I noticed a strange behavior img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comRIyhG.png altenter image description herep  pThis is a performance test of matrix multiplication of square matrices from size 50 to size 1500. The results are an average calculated from 10 runs. The measurements are indicated by dots on the lines and the lines themselves are smoothed. As you can see, the lines of the sequential and parallel functions cross two times. Actually, three times, but the first one is around the matrix sizes 6080, hence not visible in this chart. That is normal, since threads introduce overhead, so fast functions run better sequentially.p  pAre the other two intersections normal I have done multiple measurements in the 500700 region, this behavior seems prevalent.p  pThings I think could play part in this OS thread management, JVM thread management, some thread poolspecific behavior, Intel Hyper Threading since I have an intel i53210M cpu in my machine. However, what seems to be behaving irregularly to me, at least is actually the sequential algorithm. Notice how, until it hits a size of 650, it barely suffers any time penalty. Then it steepens abruptly at a size of 650. In comparison, the parallel curve seems pretty smooth.p  pI have checked the algorithms a few times, Im pretty sure they are bugfree. The results of the calculations are correct, thats for sure. My functions are measured in a double loop the outer one repeats the measurements for later averaging and the inner one increases the matrix size every step. Inside that, the source matrices are randomized, the sequential function is run and measured, then the parallel one is run and measured.p  pIs the behavior on the chart normalp  pIn mainp  precode     do n measurements     for int n  0 n lt measurements n           display progress         System.out.printlnProgress   float n  measurements  100            single measurement         for int i  0, sizen  size i lt steps i, sizen  increment                allocate memory for matrices source a, source b, result             float[][] srcaseq  new float[sizen][sizen]             float[][] srcbseq  new float[sizen][sizen]             float[][] srcapar  new float[sizen][sizen]             float[][] srcbpar  new float[sizen][sizen]             float[][] resseq  new float[sizen][sizen]             float[][] respar  new float[sizen][sizen]               fill source matrices with random values             miscManager.genRandMatrixsrcaseq, sizen             miscManager.genRandMatrixsrcbseq, sizen             miscManager.genRandMatrixsrcapar, sizen             miscManager.genRandMatrixsrcbpar, sizen               create time variables             long before, after, deltat               time measurement, serial multiplication             before  System.nanoTime             serialMultiplier.mulsrcaseq, srcbseq, resseq, sizen             after  System.nanoTime             deltat  after  before              add measurement to data             data[i][0]  deltat               time measurement, parallel multiplication             before  System.nanoTime             parallelMultiplier.mulsrcapar, srcbpar, respar, sizen             after  System.nanoTime             deltat  after  before              add measurement to data             data[i][1]  deltat                   System.out.printlnProgress 100.0 codepre  pserial multiplicationp  precodepublic void mulfloat[][] srca, float[][] srcb, float[][] res, int size      for int i  0 i lt size i          for int j  0 j lt size j              res[i][j]  0             for int k  0 k lt size k                  res[i][j]  srca[i][k]  srcb[k][j]                             codepre  pparallel multiplicationp  precodepublic void mulfloat[][] srca, float[][] srcb, float[][] res, int size        calculate data required for labor division     int n  size  size     int load  n  cpuCoreCount  1     int remainder  n  cpuCoreCount       create thread pool     ExecutorService taskExecutor  Executors.newFixedThreadPoolcpuCoreCount       assign tasks     int m  0     int i  0     while i lt remainder          taskExecutor.executenew MultiplierUnitsrca, srcb, res, size, m, m  load         m  load         i          load     while i lt cpuCoreCount          taskExecutor.executenew MultiplierUnitsrca, srcb, res, size, m, m  load         m  load         i            wait for tasks to finish     taskExecutor.shutdown     try        taskExecutor.awaitTerminationLong.MAXVALUE, TimeUnit.NANOSECONDS      catch InterruptedException e          System.out.printlnerror thread pool interrupted exception         System.exit1       codepre  pThe values in the data array are later divided by measurements to get the average.p  pMultiplierUnitp  precodepublic class MultiplierUnit implements Runnable        source a, source b, result     private final float[][] srca, srcb, res      matrix dimensions, first entry to execute, last entry to execute     private final int size, first, last      public MultiplierUnitfloat[][] srca, float[][] srcb, float[][] res,             int size, int first, int last          this.srca  srca         this.srcb  srcb         this.res  res         this.size  size         this.first  first         this.last  last            parallel multiplication     Override     public void run           index setup         int i  first  size         int j  first  size         int n  first           computation         while n lt last              while j lt size ampamp n lt last                  res[i][j]  0                 for int k  0 k lt size k                      res[i][j]  srca[i][k]  srcb[k][j]                                  n                 j                          j  0             i                codepre

I want to have a form on the front page that will simply save their email to a database and use that to send mail in the future.p  pI was wondering what the best way to implement this was. I was thinking of making an Email model and setting the home page as the Email new path. I also plan on having a static pages controller for simple about and contact stuff. Is it possible to call the new Email method from the static pages controller so that way I wont have to create an EmailController as well Could I do something like include a home method in my StaticPagesController and put the form for new EmailModel in the home viewp
Negative 60010 pI am working on an isomorphic ReactFluxexpress app and using webpack loaders for my sass with sassloader and jsx files.  I am not sure how to inject my stylesheets into a server side template.  I took a look at the Extract Text Plugin for this purpose, but I really want to be able to use hot module replacement.  Right now, I am loading my codemain.scsscode file in a React component like thisp  precodeif typeof window  undefined    requirestylecsssass......stylesmain.scss  codepre  pThis works well for loading an individual stylesheet in a component, but there is a flicker before the React part is mounted. I understand that this is because this is injecting the stylesheet emafterem my clientside app has loaded, so the stylesheet is not immediately available.  This leads to the actual question is there a way to inject this stylesheet into my serverside template while still using the webpack loader, or does this call for a separate gulpfile or express middleware I was previously using a gulpfile to build my stylesheets, but I will end up having a lot of stylesheets and dont want them all jammed into one file.p

Negative 60010 pThe following are about IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate 14.0.3 and Android Studio 1.1p  pApparently IntelliJ IDEA either IC or IU and Android Studio base on the same platform. Besides, according to a hrefhttpsandroid.googlesource.complatformtoolsidealogmasterplugins relnofollowhttpsandroid.googlesource.complatformtoolsidealogmasterpluginsa, the Gradle plugin of Android Studio are just a copy of that of IntelliJ IDEA. However there is another repository a hrefhttpsandroid.googlesource.complatformprebuiltsgradleplugin relnofollowhttpsandroid.googlesource.complatformprebuiltsgradleplugina that contains some files shipped by Android Studio but not IntelliJ IDEA.p  pBefore creating the first project in Android Studio, we may open the settings and check the offline checkbox, unplug the Ethernet wire, and build the new project just as normal. IntelliJ IDEA doesnt ship with a Gradle distribution or a local repository, and even after I copied those files and made the same directory tree, IntelliJ IDEA insists to download the Gradle distribution from the Internet.p  pIn some part of the world its difficult to access some sites, and the SQL feature in IU, which Android Studio doesnt provide, is very useful at least for me, while there are bugs when the latest SDK tool cooperates with Android projects without Gradle in IntelliJ IDEA. Nevertheless, I still believe that there must be someone awesome enough to come up with a good solution to this obstacle. Thank you very muchp

Negative 60010 pI am using PHP, mySQL and JQuery Mobile to dynamically create a question and answer routine.  Based on the users answer a set of new questions can be generated.  Everything is working great except, I can not figure out how to destroy an expanded element.

Negative 60010 pThe following is code Ive written to work out a shopping list. What Id like to do is have users enter the item to purchase, the quantity and price before tax. At the end of each entry, Id like to see a rolling list and the option to add another item. If the user doesnt want to add an item, then menu options will appear asking if they want to Add, Delete, See List or Quit. p  pThe codes Im having trouble with are headlined with comments. Other comments are just explaining my thought process when assigning variables and such.p  pIm new at this so if it looks odd that would be why. This program is stemmed from an assignment, but Im trying to add more to it. Our instructor wants us to use classes, but I am more comfortable with the program as follows right now so thought maybe if I did that first and moved pieces into the classes it would work. Any advice or resolution to the comments below would be great. p  precode    menuoptions  A Add Item, D Delete Item, E Edit Item, S See List, Q Quit  for later use     shoppinglist  Items 0, Quantity 0, Total Cost 0 To create storage for later use  at the end of the program Id like a final list with Quantity and total estimated cost.     itemlist  []  to create an empty list     repeat  True      while repeat  True         repeat  False          while True             item  inputEnter the item you wish to purchase              printitem              quantity  intinputHow many would you like to buy              printquantity              price  floatinputWhat is the price before tax              print, price      This items part below is taking the user input from item above and is printing fine, except it is printing the same item and print output the same number of characters. So if the user entered hat, 1, 5, it would print 1. hat, 1 of them, 5.0 each. But it will print three of the hat lines. So 2. hat, 1.... and 3. would be hat.... Cant figure out how to stop this.             items  item             number  1                                                for str in item    print numbered entries                 print Shopping Listn, number,., item, ,, quantity, of them,, ,price, each.                 number  number  1    crucial added line              addanother  inputAdd another item [yn] gt              repeat  True if addanother  y else False             if addanother  n                 break     I would like this part to loop each time a user performs an action A, D or S.         while addanother  n             useropt  inputWould you like to [A]dd, [D]elete, [S]ee List or [Q]uit gt              useropt  useropt.upper             if useropt in menuoptions                 break             else                 printYou must enter an A, D, S or Q  At the time a user enters Q, I would like the shopping list storage part above to run.      From this point down nothing works. The line you must enter... lets input be received, but it doesnt prompt anything below.              if useropt  A                 addmore  inputAdd another item [yn] gt                  repeat  True if addmore  y else False                 item.appenditem                 printItem added.                if useropt  D                   removeitem  inputWhat number of the item would you like to remove gt                    itemlist.removeitem                   printItem removed.

Negative 60010 pIm creating an Android app, and I want one of my Activities to keep running until the user presses the backbutton when just that Activity is open.br Currently, that Activity is being stopped as the app starts other Activities, but strongI wonder if it is possible to prevent that Activity to stop when the app need more memory or something alikestrongp  pThis example describes my problemp  pI have four Activities, codeAcode, codeBcode, codeCcode, codeDcode and codeEcode. Activity codeCcode is the one I want to prevent from being stopped. The Activity named codeAcode is the main menu of the app which starts first of all.  p  pThe user starts the app, which launches Activity codeAcode.br The second Activity, codeBcode, is started by the user with a click on one of the buttons in the menu.br The user browses a file and clicks on it, which launches the third Activity, codeCcode. The user clicks an item in a list which display data from the file. This starts Activity codeDcode. The user looks around at the data, and clicks another item in a list in that Activity to get more detailed information about that data. This starts Activity codeEcode. Now, Activity codeCcode is also being stopped. This causes some problems, so I need to keep it running.p

From my first attempt which is using codetestcode, Did it work because of the reason that i used codeconstexprcode on the constructor already If that is the case then would it good to assume that all classes that have codeconstexprcode on their constructors will result to all objects instantiated or created with it to be codeconstexprcodep  pBonus questionp  pIf I have a codeconstexprcode constructor, is it bad to do something like  codetest  t  new testcode   p

Negative 60010 pI have a codeUIViewcode with a bunch of subviews. Each subview can either be clicked codeUITouchUpInsidecode or swiped codeUITouchDragExitcode to perform a different action. Both actions work as intended separately, but since the subviews are really close together, the codeUITouchDragExitcode Control event of one view accidentally activates the codeUITouchUpInsidecode of the subview above it. p  pIn order to avoid this, I was thinking of making the subview ignore all other touches to its other subviews until the codeUITouchDragExitcode gesture is over. What would be the best way of accomplishing this In other words how can I detect the startend of UITouchDragExitp  pThanks in advancep
Negative 60010 pI am working on an rss feed reader. There are 2 distinct rss channels that serve as sources for the 2 separate kinds of rss feeds. Each of these feeds can be viewed by the user by selecting a particular segmented control button on the top in the navbar. Both the feeds are laid out in the form of a list of items represented by tableviewcells. Since both the channels are handled by the same viewcontroller, both of them share the tableviewcell objects as well. And off course my viewcontroller is a uitableviewcontroller. Now, in one of the channels i want to set accessories like a checkmark or, for instance, favorite one of the titles of a feed by hightlighting its title which in disguise happens to be the title of the tableviewcells label that the feed is represented by. The problem is that when i switch the rss channel type by tapping on the other segmented control, the changes made previously affect the feeds on the other side too. This is obvious since both the type of feeds are represented by the same set tableviewcells and the changes are actually done at the cell level and not to the rss items per se.. Here is my code.p  precode voidalertViewUIAlertView alertView didDismissWithButtonIndexNSIntegerbuttonIndex    NSLogalertView dismissed       if buttonIndex1 ampamp rssType0            NSLogcheck        [[self.tableView cellForRowAtIndexPathselectedIndexPath].textLabel setTextColor[UIColor orangeColor]]               [[self.tableView cellForRowAtIndexPathselectedIndexPath] setSelectedNO animatedYES]        codepre  pIn the above code i am highlighting favoriting the selected rss item the title of the selected cell which is also supposed to be the title of the rss item of the BNR channel type. When i switch to the other feed type, the highlight appears there too, for the cells are shared between the rss item types. p  precode   voidtableViewUITableView tableView didSelectRowAtIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath          NSLogcell selected ,[tableView cellForRowAtIndexPathindexPath]      if isEditable         selectedIndexPath indexPath        UIAlertView alertView [[UIAlertView alloc] initWithTitleYoure sure you want to favorite this item messagenil delegateself cancelButtonTitleCANCEL otherButtonTitlesDO IT, nil]       [alertView show]             else      Push the web view controller onto the navigation stack  this implicitly      creates the web view controllers view the first time through        if [self splitViewController]  For iphone           [[self navigationController] pushViewControllerwebViewController animatedYES]                 elsefor iPad                 We have to create a new nav controller, as the old one was only retained by splitviewcontroller and is now gone.         UINavigationController newDetailNav [[UINavigationController alloc] initWithRootViewControllerself.webViewController]          [[self splitViewController] setViewControllers[[self navigationController], newDetailNav]]Resetting masterview and then detailview                  Make the detail view controller the delegate of the split view controller         [[self splitViewController] setDelegateself.webViewController]                Grab the selected item          RSSItem entry  [[channel items] objectAtIndex[indexPath row]]      MyTableViewCell selectedCell [tableView cellForRowAtIndexPathindexPath]     NSLogchannel check ,channel           RSSItem entry [channel itemWithTitleselectedCell.textLabel.text]Not used.. But do not delete this line.      RSSItem entry [channel itemWithLinkselectedCell.link]       [[BNRFeedStore sharedStore] markItemAsReadentry]          immediately add a tick mark to this row     [[tableView cellForRowAtIndexPathindexPath] setAccessoryTypeUITableViewCellAccessoryCheckmark]      [webViewController listViewControllerself handleObjectsentry]  codepre  pp  pIn the above code, there is a line [[tableView cellForRowAtIndexPathindexPath] setAccessoryTypeUITableViewCellAccessoryCheckmark]. This setting is supposed to put a checkmark on the selected tableviewcell when the rss channel type BNRType.. And so when the channel type is switched to the other type, the checkmark does not appear on the same tableviewcell with different item feed information this time. p  pHow is this possible Any changes made to the same cell should be persistent across different states different channel types. In the favoriting a selected BNR rss item case, the highlights made on the BNR item also appeared on the other item iTunes feed item but setting a checkmark accessory does not have the similar behavior.. p  pMy goal is to restrict the favoriting an item only to the BNRType side. Checkmarking an item does give this kind of result without doing any extra work but i do not understand how. Can someone point out the differences between setting the two properties highlighting the text of a selected cells label vs setting a checkmark accessory for the same in terms of how they let the cells viewing properties persist differently and then suggest a workaround for highlighting the cell in such a way that the effect does not show up on the other rss channel type even though it is using the same set of tableviewcells. p

Negative 60010 pThis is my first post and Ill do my best to keep it to the point. p  pAt my place of work we create stored procedures either through Visual Studio 2013 or SQL Server Management Studio manually using TSQL scripts. p  pWhat wed like to do is perform this task through a script or interface automatically. Which means for us putting the scripts in a location and have the stored procedures automatically created based on the TSQL scripts. Ive found one Powershell script on the Web that allows for the user to put all of their stored procedure creation scripts in one directory and then create them in the database by running the script. However, this script destroys the formatting, which in my company, is important. p  pPerforming the task manually with VS 2013 and SQL Server Management Studio preserves the formatting of the scripts in the database as they are created. p  pHow can I automate the creation of stored procedures with preexisting TSQL scripts, in a SQL Server  TFS  Release Management, environment, while preserving the formatting of stored procedure scripts in the databasep

Negative 60010 pI have installed Ubuntu server 14.04 LTS non gui and apache2.4p  pI have installed a local OpenStreetMap tile server following the instructions for building with packages.

So I changed the nominatim conf to unominatim so it came after tileserver. This made it work.p  pBut I cannot work out why the sequence of the virtual servers startup makes a difference.p  pIf someone can spot why these hosts fail after a restart I would be very grateful. Im no expert on Apache so I assume Im missing something fairly obvious.p  pIm using the local HOSTS file to resolve the domain names to make things simple while I get things going.p  pBelow is the conf for the Tileserver sitep  precode This is the Apache server configuration file for providing OSM tile support  through modtile  ltVirtualHost 80gt     ServerAdmin webmasterlocalhost      ServerName tile.mytileserver.org     ServerAlias a.tile.mytileserver.org b.tile.mytileserver.org c.tile.mytileserver.org     DocumentRoot varwww                     increase the log level for more detailed information     LogLevel info   You can manually configure each tile set with AddTileConfig or AddTileMimeConfig.  The first argument is the URL path relative to this virtual host  under which a tile set is served. The second argument specifies the  name of the tile set. This is used in the communication with renderd  and is the directory under which metatiles are stored on disk.   By default AddTileConfig modtile assumes you are serving png files, however,  modtile can also serve arbitrary other tile types such as javascript vector tiles,  assuming the backend render daemon can handle the file type.  To this purpose AddTileMimeConfig takes a 3rd agument, the file extension and it  will guess the correct mimetype from it. If the mime type is not set correctly automatically,  you need to use the configuration file route, where you can specify the mimetype and file extension  independently.       AddTileConfig folder TileSetName     AddTileMimeConfig folder2 TileSetName2 js   Alternatively or in addition you can load all the tile sets defined in the configuration file into this virtual host     LoadTileConfigFile etcrenderd.conf   Timeout before giving up for a tile to be rendered     ModTileRequestTimeout 3   Timeout before giving up for a tile to be rendered that is otherwise missing     ModTileMissingRequestTimeout 10   If tile is out of date, dont rerender it if past this load threshold users gets old tile     ModTileMaxLoadOld 2   If tile is missing, dont render it if past this load threshold user gets 404 error     ModTileMaxLoadMissing 5   Socket where we connect to the rendering daemon     ModTileRenderdSocketName varrunrenderdrenderd.sock    Options controlling the cache proxy expiry headers. All values are in seconds.   Caching is both important to reduce the load and bandwidth of the server, as  well as reduce the load time for the user. The site loads fastest if tiles can be  taken from the users browser cache and no round trip through the internet is needed.  With minutely or hourly updates, however there is a tradeoff between cacheability  and freshness. As one cant predict the future, these are only heuristics, that  need tuning.  If there is a known update schedule such as only using weekly planet dumps to update the db,  this can also be taken into account through the constant PLANETINTERVAL in renderconfig.h  but requires a recompile of modtile   The values in this sample configuration are not the same as the defaults  that apply if the config settings are left out. The defaults are more conservative  and disable most of the heuristics.     Caching is always a tradeoff between being up to date and reducing server load or  client side latency and bandwidth requirements. Under some conditions, like poor  network conditions it might be more important to have good caching rather than the latest tiles.  Therefor the following config options allow to set a special hostheader for which the caching  behaviour is different to the normal heuristics   The CacheExtended parameters overwrite all other caching parameters including CacheDurationMax  for tiles being requested via the hostname CacheExtendedHostname ModTileCacheExtendedHostname cache.tile.openstreetmap.org ModTileCacheExtendedDuration 2592000   Upper bound on the length a tile will be set cacheable, which takes  precedence over other settings of cacheing ModTileCacheDurationMax 604800   Sets the time tiles can be cached for that are known to by outdated and have been  sent to renderd to be rerendered. This should be set to a value corresponding  roughly to how long it will take renderd to get through its queue. There is an additional  fuzz factor on top of this to not have all tiles expire at the same time ModTileCacheDurationDirty 900   Specify the minimum time modtile will set the cache expiry to for fresh tiles. There  is an additional fuzz factor of between 0 and 3 hours on top of this. ModTileCacheDurationMinimum 10800   Lower zoom levels are less likely to change noticeable, so these could be cached for longer  without users noticing much.  The heuristic offers three levels of zoom, Low, Medium and High, for which different minimum  cacheing times can be specified.  Specify the zoom level below  which Medium starts and the time in seconds for which they can be cached ModTileCacheDurationMediumZoom 13 86400  Specify the zoom level below which Low starts and the time in seconds for which they can be cached ModTileCacheDurationLowZoom 9 518400   A further heuristic to determine cacheing times is when was the last time a tile has changed.  If it hasnt changed for a while, it is less likely to change in the immediate future, so the  tiles can be cached for longer.  For example, if the factor is 0.20 and the tile hasnt changed in the last 5 days, it can be cached  for up to one day without having to revalidate. ModTileCacheLastModifiedFactor 0.20   Tile Throttling  Tile scrappers can often download large numbers of tiles and overly staining tileserver resources  modtile therefore offers the ability to automatically throttle requests from ip addresses that have  requested a lot of tiles.  The mechanism uses a token bucket approach to shape traffic. I.e. there is an initial pool of n tiles  per ip that can be requested arbitrarily fast. After that this pool gets filled up at a constant rate  The algorithm has to metrics. One based on overall tiles served to an ip address and a second one based on  the number of requests to renderd  tirex to render a new tile.    Overall enable or disable tile throttling ModTileEnableTileThrottling Off  When the tileserver is behind a proxy one can use the XForwardedFor http header to determin the remote IP for throttling  0 dont use XForwardedFor  1 Use the first address in the XForwarded chain, which should be the client address. However, this may not be trusted.  2 Use the last address in the XForwarded chain. If one uses a reverse proxy, this will be the IP address seen by the reverse proxy and can be trusted. ModTileEnableTileThrottlingXForward 0   Parameters poolsize in tiles and topup rate in tiles per second for throttling tile serving.  ModTileThrottlingTiles 10000 1   Parameters poolsize in tiles and topup rate in tiles per second for throttling render requests.

Negative 60010 pIn my Android app I have an ImageView which displays an image from assets. What I need to do is to display a text almost centered in the image what I mean by almost centered is aligned to a rectangle which is near from the center of the image.

I have tried using dp, with no luck.p  pSo, what I want to do is to display text inside this rectangle. I have the x, y coordinates of each point of the rectangle in pixels relative to the emulator.p  pHow can I do to make that design responsivep  pThank youp

Negative 60010 pI am new to JSF and I am currently building a webauction type of application, based on it. I have also used multiple elements from Bootsfaces. What I would like to do is have an inputText where bidders can type their bids and then press a button that will trigger a Bootsfaces modal. Inside the modal, the bidder will have to confirm that he actually wants to bid, by pressing a commandButton that will eventually submit his bid. In order for this to work if I have understood correctly how JSF works, I need the inputText and the commandButton inside the same hform element. The only problem is that, whenever I put the code of the modal inside the form, the modal doesnt show up when I press the button that triggers it.

What is the most efficient way to proceedp  pGiven the output is regular, I thought codereadrcode would be a good idea .  The only way I can think of, is to do it manually by chunks in order to eliminate the useless info linesp  precodelibraryreadr ztot  numericniternxny  allocate a vector with final size   the arrays will be vectorized and successively appended to each other for i in 1niter    nskip  i1ny1  1  number of lines to skip, including the info lines   z  readtablemyfile, skip  nskip, nmax  ny, colnamesF   z  as.vectortz   ifirst  i1nynx  1  appropriate index   ztot[ifirstifirstnxny1]  z    The arrays are actually spatial rasters.

How can I achieve this fasterp  pIs there a way to read everything at once and delete the useless rows afterwardsp  pAlternatively, is there no reading function accepting a vector with precise locations as codeskipcode argument, rather than a single number of initial rowsp  pemPS note the reading operation is to be repeated on many files same structure located in different directories, in case it influences the solution...emp
