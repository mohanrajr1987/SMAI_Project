Positive 25863 pI have a codeUIImageViewcode subclass in swift set up so I can access touchesBegantouchesMovedtouchesEnded.p  pWhen one of these methods is called, I need to change a property of a different, loaded view.p  pIt seems to me that I will now need to access the active view controller in order to set the properties of this other view. Is there are better way to go about this such as event methods called in the view controllerp  pNote that Im new to iOS and I am not extremely familiar with the event system yet, as most information Ive found is written in Objective C and not in Swift. Dont worry, Im looking through Apples Documentation.p  pAlso, no, I cant change the codeUIImageViewcode to a codeUIButtoncode. Even if I changed to a codeUIButtoncode, I need access to the individual codetouchesBegancode, etc. methods and the same problem would persist.p

When I make the first view controller and Embed in Navigation Controller through the Interface Builder, it dosnt enable the back swipe.p  pMaybe its because I add view controller 2 and 3 to view controller 1 programmatically But it dosnt work either if I embed view controller 3 in a navigation controller, eventhoug I have connected everything from there on via segues.p  pView controller 1, 3 and 5 have scrollviews embedded, maybe the swipe functions of the scrollview overrides the swipe back functionp  pThe view controllers 2 and 3 are embedded in view controller 1 like thisp  precodescrollView.addSubviewViewControllerThree.view codepre  pI havnt tried to make the navigation controller programmatically, if that posible.p  pAny ideasp  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comrIe0S.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comrIe0S.png altOverview of Storyboardap  pstrongEDITstrongp  pIve tried doing it programmatically like thisp  pI add the following code to app delegate codeapplicationdidFinishLaunchingWithOptionscode, and remove the navigation controller from my storyboard.

Negative 25863 pWe are mainting a web application that is built on Classic ASP using VBScript as the primary language. We are in agreement that our backend framework if you will is out dated and doesnt provide us with the proper tools to move forward in a quick manner. We have pretty much embraced the current webMVC pattern that is all over the place, and cannot do it, in a reasonable manner, with the current technology. The big missing features are proper dispatching and templating with inheritance, amongst others.p  pCurrently there are two paths being discussedp  ol liPort the existing application to Classic ASP using JScript, which will allow us to hopefully go from there to .NET MSJscript without too much trouble, and eventually end up on the .NET platform preferably the MVC stuff will be done by then, ASP.NET isnt much better than were we are on now, in our opinions. This has been argued as the safer path with less risk than the next option, albeit it might take slightly longer.li liCompletely rewrite the application using some other technology, right now the leader of the pack is Python WSGI with a custom framework, ORM, and a good templating solution. There is wiggle room here for even django and other prebuilt solutions. This method would hopefully be the quickest solution, as we would probably run a beta beside the actual product, but it does have the potential for a big waste of time if we cantdont get it right.li ol  pThis does not mean that our logic is gone, as what we have built over the years is fairly stable, as noted just difficult to deal with. It is built on SQL Server 2005 with heavy use of stored procedures and published on IIS 6, just for a little more background.p  pNow, the question. Has anyone taken either of the two paths above If so, was it successful, how could it have been better, etc. We arent looking to deviate much from doing one of those two things, but some suggestions or other solutions would potentially be helpful.p

Negative 25863 pSince I was 13 and playing around with AMOS 3D Ive been wanting to learn how to code 3D graphics. Now, 10 years later, I finally think I have have accumulated enough maths to give it a go.p  pI have followed various tutorials, and defined screenX and screenY, equivalently asp  precodescreenX  pointX  cameraX  distance codepre  pPlus offsets and scaling.p  pMy problem is with what the distance variable actually refers to. I have seen distance being defined as the difference in z between the camera and the point. However, that cannot be completely right though, since x and y have the same effect as z on the actual distance from the camera to the point. I implemented distance as the actual distance, but the result gives a somewhat skewed perspective, as if it had too much perspective.p  pMy actual distance implementation was along the lines ofp  precodedistance  new VectorpointX, pointY, cameraZ  pointZ.magnitude codepre  pPlaying around with the code, I added an extra variable to my equation, a perspectiveCoefficient as followsp  precodedistance  new VectorpointX  perspectiveCoefficient,    pointY  perspectiveCoefficient, cameraZ  pointZ.magnitude codepre  pFor some reason, that is beyond me, I tend to get the best result setting the perspectiveCoefficient to 1sqrt2.p  pMy 3D test cube is at a hrefhttpvega.soi.city.ac.ukabdv8663dcubetest3dtest.svg relnofollowhttpvega.soi.city.ac.ukabdv8663dcubetest3dtest.svga. Tested in Safari and FF. It prompts you for a perspectiveCoefficient, where 0 gives a perspective without taking xy distance into consideration, and 1 gives you a perspective where x, y and z distance is equally considered. It defaults to 1sqrt2. The cube can be rotated about x and y using the arrow keys. For anyone interested, the relevant code is in update in the View.js file.p  pGrateful for any ideas on this.p

The problem is I have to JOIN them and the search takes 0.3 seconds which to me makes no sense because the slow aspects of the combined query on Table B should be quicker because we are now only searching over a fraction of that table  ie it should not be doing a full table scan because the field that is being JOINED on is indexed.p

Negative 25863 pC, ASP.NET 3.5 Environment Im using Microsofts DSOFile.dll for counting the pages in a word document .doc format. When I deployed my application to a medium trust environment GoDaddy I got a security exception.

When commented out, the file acts normally, and while it doesnt give counts for .doc files, it does count the other types of files i have cases set up for. I thought it may have something to do with Absolute vs Relative paths, but then I noticed that even when debugging locally after setting my trust level in my app to Medium it crashed without actually running any methods, and simply as a result of that line being in there. So, obviously Medium Trust and this method of file IO dont work. This behavior is the same for my web service through SOAP and JSON as well as on a test ASP.NET page I created. Does anyone know of an alternative method for achieving what I want to do in a Medium Trust environmentp

Each line is read as one string value and I want to parse out single words and any number of words contained inside single quotes. I know less than nothing about regular expressions but Ive hobbled together a regular expression using the regex or operator  that got me close.p  pTaking that regex I first tried parsing each line using a string splitp  precodetextline.splitw. codepre  pWhich resulted in the following, less than acceptable, arraysp  precode[, line1] [, Line two,  , fudgy,  , whale,  , rolly polly] [, fudgy,  , line three,  , whale] [, fudgy,  , whale,  , line four] [, line five,  , fish heads] [, line, , six] codepre  pI next tried using scan instead of a split and I saw thisp  precodetextline.scanw.

Im thinking instead of hamhandedly fixing the sloppy output from my poorly constructed regex I should just write a better regular expression.p  pSo, strongis it possible to use a single regular expression to parse the above lines and get the desired outputstrong I may be way off on the regex to begin with but Im thinking if I could just somehow group the ors so they only return one value per group that would probably be what Im looking for.p  pPlease feel free to suggest alternate solutions but strongIm looking for elegant solutions done the Ruby waystrong since Im trying to teach myself how to use the language.p  pThanks in advance for your time.p  pstrongedited to incorporate tininfis better, more accurate regexstrongp

Negative 25863 pIm learning c right now and Id like to start interfacing with a graphics card and play with the basics of 3d graphics. I havent found it in my book or in internet queries, and I actually have absolutely no idea where to start with this.

So what is OpenGL, and how can I use it in conjunction with c in order to pass processing to the GPU Are there other more direct or flexible ways to work with C and a graphics cardp

Negative 25863 pWe have a need to customize the logic of our N2 authentication to add a couple of options.p  pI need to add a RadioButtonList that contains some options and set a session var based on the selection of that RadioButton on Login  otherwise the user cannot see the site in the preview pane of N2. I thought I could just add the RadioButtonList to the N2Login.aspx and create a custom Login Class that extended N2.Edit.Login and override the Login1Authenticate method to do my custom logic before calling base.Login1Authenticate. It seems that it is not designed to be extensible and I cannot override that method. To make my change I would have to do a custom compile of N2 with these changes, which I want to avoid should be closed to modification but open to extension so we dont have to redo our changes every time we update N2.p  pAnother route I tried was to create N2CustomLogin.aspx and add all of my logic in that custom class and set the web.config to point to CustomLogin.aspx instead of Login.aspx  this sent me to the correct login page initially but a failed login redirected me to Login.aspx assuming something hard coded which did not have our radio button options.p  pWe are using N2 CMS 2.0.0.0 on .Net 4.0 MVC appp

Negative 25863 pI have a code that is leaking on Windows. It runs fine on many unix platforms and the leak only occurs on Windows. The binary consists of exe, 1 dll and 2 static libs. The exe links to both the dll and the static libs, while the static libs link with the dll as well. The leak occurs in the exe code when instead of calling to a vector deleting destructor, for some reason scalar deleting destructor is called. This results in only the first object in the array to be deleted while the rest of the array stays in memory.p  pThe leaking pseudocode looks like thisp  precodeclass MyClassFromExe  public MyBaseClassFromDll    public     ClassFromDll marr      MyClassFromExeunsigned int size              marr  new ClassFromDll[size]           MyClassFromExe             delete [] marr        void func    MyClassFromExe obj3  codepre  pWhen func finishes and the destructor is called I see that only the destructor of the first object in marr is called. From debugger I see that this is done from scalar deleting destructor and not from vector deleting destructor. This explains why only the first object is destroyed. What I need to understand is why scalar deleting destructor is called when delete [] is usedp  pI found this thread  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3373193whyisvectordeletingdestructorbeingcalledasaresultofascalardeleteWhy is vector deleting destructor being called as a result of a scalar deletea. I followed the suggestions there and made sure that all the modules are compiled with MD.p  pImportant to notice that when the dll that contains ClassFromDll was a static library and not a dll, everything worked fine. The leak started only when the static library was changed to be a dll. While the program leaks in Release mode, it crashes in Debug mode on delete [] marr. The crash occurs in dbgdel.cpp line 52  BLOCKTYPEISVALIDpHeadnBlockUse.p  pOn unix platforms this lib is also a shared lib and as expected vector deleting destructor is called there and there is no leak. Could the problem be with the VC compiler Or maybe some other settings of the projects need to be changed Im using VC2003.p  pThank you in advancep

Negative 25863 pWhen using integer columns is it better to have 0 or NULL to indicate no value. For example, if a table had a parentid field and a particular entry had no parent, would you use 0 or NULL. I have in the past always used 0, this is because I come from a Java world where prior to 1.5 integers always had to have a value. I am asking mainly in relation to performance, I am not too worried about which is the more correct option.p

Negative 25863 pIve been playing with KnockoutJS and absolutely love how much it simplifies the design from every angle by keeping stuff from falling through the cracks.  My question is what is the recommended best practice for saving the data back to the server  My understanding is that in a connected MVVM, the first M is the data layer and so the dependency tracking and notifications in the ViewModel trigger saves directly back to the data layer.  In a JavaScript app, we are disconnected and selectively save back to the server using AJAX.p  pThe app Im currently using it in is MVC3 and I absolutely get how to write a Save action on my controller, plop a Save button somewhere on my page, post the whole ViewModel to that Save action and then persist that to the database.  But what about when you make a quick edit and then save it again  Or what if a save button doesnt fit the flow of the design Instead, you want to post to the action every time a change is made on the form with no save button at all  The ideas that Ive bounced around arep  ulliPost the whole ViewModel every time any change is made and make the Action figure out what is new and what isnt not ideal, especially for large models, if nothing else because the data transmitted on each save would be unnecessarily large.liliAdd a property to each item in the ViewModel that tracks whether it is new andor changed since the last save.  Then, grep out those items and post only those to the server I havent tested this, but I assume this can be done using the destroy property, as intended for a Rails app.liliSeparate into as many smaller ViewModels as is plausible so that any pain from the first two options is minimized this should probably be done regardless.liliSome other better wayliul  pIm hopeful there are some good ideas out there that I havent thought of.  To be able to declaratively bind everything AND still save emefficientlyem would be awesome.p

Negative 25863 pSo, my scenario is thisp  pI have an NSManagedObject subclass in my iOS application, and as a property I want to store the contents of an MKPolygon object. The way Ive decided to go about this and whether its valid is perhaps a different question is to declare the polygon property as a transformable object, then store an NSArray containing the polygons points as an NSValue object. p  pTo this end, Ive written a couple of convenience class methods on my model objectp  precode NSArray coordsArrayFromMKPolygonMKPolygon polygon pointCountintcount      CLLocationCoordinate2D coords  CLLocationCoordinate2D mallocsizeofCLLocationCoordinate2D  count     [polygon getCoordinatescoords rangeNSMakeRange0, count]     NSMutableArray coordsArray  [NSMutableArray array]     for int i  0 i lt count i          NSValue coordVal  [NSValue valueWithBytesampcoords[i] objCTypeencodeCLLocationCoordinate2D]         [coordsArray addObjectcoordVal]          freecoords     return [NSArray arrayWithArraycoordsArray]    MKPolygon polygonFromCoordsArrayNSArray coordsArray pointCountintcount      CLLocationCoordinate2D coords  CLLocationCoordinate2D mallocsizeofCLLocationCoordinate2D  count     for int i  0 i lt count i          CLLocationCoordinate2D coord         [[coordsArray objectAtIndexi] getValueampcoord]         coords[i]  coord          freecoords     return [MKPolygon polygonWithCoordinatescoords countcount]  codepre  pI can just call these methods on my MKPolygon objects before saving or loading an instance of the model, but Id like to override the dynamic getters and setters in the model itself, so that I can just say something like code[turf setTurfboundspolygon]code where polygon is an MKPolygon instance.p  pWhat Id really like is to be able to do something like thisp  precode voidsetTurfboundsidturfbounds      MKPolygon poly  MKPolygon turfbounds     NSArray coordsArray  [Turf coordsArrayFromMKPolygonpoly pointCount[poly pointCount]]      Save the converted value into the dynamic turfbounds property    idturfbounds       grab the contents of the dynamic turfbounds property into say, NSArray coordsArray     return [Turf polygonFromCoordsArraycoordsArray pointCount[coordsArray count]]  codepre  pBut Ive had no joy so far.

Negative 25863 pPart of my project is to persist data from another source. In this case we have an SAP data source that we will need to pull data from.

Negative 25863 pI  was going through ACID properties regarding Transaction and encountered the statement below across the different sites ACID is the acronym for the four properties guaranteed by transactions atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability. p  pMy question is specifically about the phrase.p  blockquote   pguaranteed by transactionsp blockquote  p. As per my experience these properties are not taken care by transaction automatically. But as a java developer we need to ensure that these properties criteria are met.p  pLets go through for each propertyp  ol lipAtomicity Assume when we create the customer the account should be created too as it is compulsory.  So now during transaction the customer gets created while during account creation some exception oocurs. So the developer can now go two ways either he rolls back the complete transaction atomicity is met in this case or he commits the transaction so customer will be created but not the account which violates the atomicity. So responsibility lies with developerpli lipConsistency Same reason holds valid for consistency toopli lipIsolation  as per definition isolation makes a transaction execute without interference from another process or transactions.br But this is achieved when we set the isolation level as Serializable. Otherwis in another case like read commited or read uncommited changes are visible to other transactions.  So responsibility lies with the developer to make it really isolated with Serializablepli lipDurability If we commit the transaction, then even if the application crashes, it should be committed on restart of application.  Not sure if it needs to be taken care by developer or by database vendortransactionpli ol  pSo as per my understanding these ACID properties are not guaranteed automatically rather we as a developer sjould achieve them. Please let me know if above understanding regarding each point is correct Would appreciate if you folks can reply  for each pointyesno will also do.p  pAs per my understanding read committed should be most logical isolation level in most application, though it depends on requirement too.p

Negative 25863 pI recently asked a question here on Stack Overflow about how to cast my data from a 16bit integer followed by an undetermined amount of voidcast memory into an stdvector of unsigned chars for the sake of using a socket library known as NetLink which uses a function whose signature looks like this to send raw datap  precodevoid rawSendconst vectorltunsigned chargt data codepre  pfor reference, heres that question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7683044castinganunsignedintastringtoanunsignedcharvectorCasting an unsigned int  a string to an unsigned char vectorap  pThe question was successfully answered and Im grateful to those who responded.  Mike DeSimone responded with an example of a sendmessage function that converts the data into a format that NetLink accepts an stdvector, which looks like thisp  precodevoid sendmessageNLSocket socket, uint16t opcode, const void rawData, sizet rawDataSize      vectorltunsigned chargt buffer     buffer.reservesizeofuint16t  rawDataSize     buffer.pushbackopcode gtgt 8     buffer.pushbackopcode amp 0xFF     const unsigned char basereinterpretcastltconst unsigned chargtrawData     buffer.insertbuffer.end, base, base  rawDataSize     socketgtrawSendampbuffer  codepre  pThis looks to be exactly what I needed, and so I set off to write an accompanying receivemessage function...p  p...but Im embarrassed to say that I dont entirely understand all the bitshifting and whatnot, so Ive run into a wall here.  In all the code Ive ever written in the past nearly decade, most of my code has been in higherlevel languages, and the rest of my code hasnt ever really called for lowerlevel memory operations.p  pBack on the subject of writing a receivemessage function, my starting point, as you might imagine, is NetLinks rawRead function, whose signature looks like thisp  precodevectorltunsigned chargt rawReadunsigned bufferSize  DEFAULTBUFFERSIZE, string hostFrom  NULL codepre  pIt looks like my code will start off something like thisp  precodevoid receivemessageNLSocket socket, uint16t opcode, const void rawData      stdvectorltunsigned char, stdallocatorltunsigned chargtgt buffer  socketgtrawRead     stdallocatorltunsigned chargt allocator  buffergtgetallocator  do I even need this allocator  I saw that one is returned as part of the above object, but...      ...  codepre  pAfter that first call to rawRead, it appears I would need to iterate through the vector, retrieving data from it and reversing bitshifting operations, and then return the data into rawData and  opcode.  Again, Im not very familiar with bitshifting I did some googling to understand the syntax, but I dont understand emwhyem the above sendmessage code requires shifting at all, so Im at a loss for my next step here.p  pCan someone help me to understand how to write this accompanying receivemessage function  As a bonus, if someone could help explain the original code so that I know for the future how it works particularly, how the shifting works in this case and why its necessary, that would serve to deepen my understanding much for the future.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 25863 pI have a CMS generating a basic navigation using a UL. Each firstlevel LI is styled to be a group. I need to apply a style to the last element within each of the first level LI groups. Meaning if a firstlevel LI has no children, I want to apply a style to it as the bottom of the group if it does have children, I want to find the last child OR grandchild element that appears again, the bottom of the group. I have used both CSS and Javascript last classes, and have successfully applied styles to the last child of a certain depth within the firstlevel LI, but that isnt helpful since the bottom button of the list is of an unknown depth. p  pMy line of thinking involves a IF statement that finds the last child of the first level, checks if it has children, and if it does, go another level deep and find that last child and checks for children, repeating this process until it finds the last LI that does not have children within the firstlevel LI groups. However, I am a JS noob and am not sure how to go about that. p  pI am open to CSS or JavaScriptjQuery solutions.

Negative 25863 pI am initially seeking guidance to make sure I go in the right direction. From there I will come back with the code and ask for further assistance. I realize it isnt cool to say hey I dont know what I am doing so I want you to do it for me.p  pSo, here is my situation. I would say my php skills are amateur, and I am looking to increase them by working on projects for myself so I can learn through practice and application. I have created a webpage which contains a form that is used to update a XML file I am playing around with flatfile DBs at the moment. All works well, the file is updated and the users is brought back to the page and the updated file is displayed. What I would like to do is allow the user to receive an update while they are browsing the website that the XML file has been updated, as well as alert them to the file update if they are returning to the website after having left. p  pMy thoughts are that this would be done by using php session variables, one when they first access the website and another when the XML file is updated by a user. For the one when they access the site I thought a variable with a unique ID and timestamp as well as a timestamp of the files lastmodified value. I realize that this requires keeping storage of the session values since the value will have to be compared to something or else it will always appear as the most recent version, hence no changes. p  pNow that I think about it I guess you wouldnt need a session variable created on file update since the comparison will be based on the lastmodified value.p  pJust want to know if I am on the right track or completely offbase.p  pAny input is greatly appreciated.p

Negative 25863 pI am dealing with a problem of text summarization i.e. given a large chunks of text, I want to find the most representative topics or the subject of the text.

This dictionary contains important words mentioned in the text. p  pI manually sifted through the entire 50,000 list of phrases sorted on their TFIDF measure and handpicked 2,000 phrases I know It took me 15 hours to do this... that are the ground truth i.e. these are important for sure. Now when I use this as a dictionary and run a simple frequency analysis on my text and extract the topk phrases, I am basically seeing what the subject is and I agree with what I am seeing.p  pNow how can I evaluate this approach There is no machine learning or classification involved here. Basically, I used some NLP techniques to create a dictionary and using the dictionary alone to do simple frequency analysis is giving me the topics I am looking for. However, is there a formal analysis I can do for my system to measure its accuracy or something elsep

I hope you can help me.p  precodeltphp errorreporting0 doc  new DOMDocument doc1  new DOMDocument docgtload test2.xml  doc1gtload test.xml  books  docgtgetElementsByTagName Aanbod   books1  doc1gtgetElementsByTagName Aanbod  foreach books as book        Titel  bookgtgetElementsByTagName Titel      title  Titelgtitem0gtnodeValue       Categorie  bookgtgetElementsByTagName Categorie      categorie  Categoriegtitem0gtnodeValue      Materiaal  bookgtgetElementsByTagName Materiaal      materiaal  Materiaalgtitem0gtnodeValue      Jaartal  bookgtgetElementsByTagName Jaartal      jaartal  Jaartalgtitem0gtnodeValue      Prijs  bookgtgetElementsByTagName Prijs      prijs  Prijsgtitem0gtnodeValue      Movie  bookgtgetElementsByTagName Movie      movie  Moviegtitem0gtnodeValue       arrdata[]  arraytitlegttitle,categoriegtcategorie,materiaalgtmateriaal,jaartalgtjaartal,prijsgtprijs,moviegtmovie          foreach books1 as book1        Titel  book1gtgetElementsByTagName Titel      title  Titelgtitem0gtnodeValue      Categorie  book1gtgetElementsByTagName Categorie      categorie  Categoriegtitem0gtnodeValue      Materiaal  book1gtgetElementsByTagName Materiaal      materiaal  Materiaalgtitem0gtnodeValue      Jaartal  book1gtgetElementsByTagName Jaartal      jaartal  Jaartalgtitem0gtnodeValue      Prijs  book1gtgetElementsByTagName Prijs      prijs  Prijsgtitem0gtnodeValue      Movie  book1gtgetElementsByTagName Movie      movie  Moviegtitem0gtnodeValue              arrdata1[]  arraytitlegttitle,categoriegtcategorie,materiaalgtmateriaal,jaartalgtjaartal,prijsgtprijs,moviegtmovie                    foreacharrdata as keygtvalue         echo  arrdata1[key]..value.ltbrgt exit      if arrdata1[key]  value                doc2  new DOMDocument         doc2gtformatOutput  true         headerContentType textplain         r  doc2gtcreateElement Main          doc2gtappendChild r          unlinktest.xml         foreacharrdata as kygtval                        b  doc2gtcreateElement Aanbod                 Titel  doc2gtcreateElement Titel                TitelgtappendChild               doc2gtcreateTextNode val[title]                               bgtappendChild Titel                 Categorie  doc2gtcreateElement Categorie                CategoriegtappendChild               doc2gtcreateTextNode val[categorie]                               bgtappendChild Categorie                 Materiaal  doc2gtcreateElement Materiaal                MateriaalgtappendChild               doc2gtcreateTextNode val[materiaal]                               bgtappendChild Materiaal                 Jaartal  doc2gtcreateElement Jaartal                JaartalgtappendChild               doc2gtcreateTextNode val[jaartal]                               bgtappendChild Jaartal                 Prijs  doc2gtcreateElement Prijs                PrijsgtappendChild               doc2gtcreateTextNode val[prijs]                               bgtappendChild Prijs                 Movie  doc2gtcreateElement Movie                MoviegtappendChild               doc2gtcreateTextNode val[movie]                               bgtappendChild Movie                rgtappendChild b                  stringData   doc2gtsaveXML                           echo hi.value[prijs].ltbrgt         myFile  test.xml          to   mijnemailemail.com . ,   note the comma         to . 0nodomain.com          To send HTML mail, the Contenttype header must be set         headers   MIMEVersion 1.0 . rn          fh  fopenmyFile, a or diecant open file         stringData  New Stuff 1n         fwritefh, stringData         fclosefh             gt codepre

Then, it looks at the codeparentidcode and writes down the codeparentidcodes name preceded by a slash. p  pThen it looks at the parents codeparentidcode and writes down that name preceded by a slash. It continues to do this until it encounters a codeparentidcode of 0.

Negative 25863 pIm trying to figure out which cache concurrency strategy should I use for my application for entity updates, in particular. The application is a webservice developed using Hibernate, is deployed on Amazon EC2 cluster and works on Tomcat, so no application server there.p  pI know that there are emnonstrictreadwriteem  emreadwriteem and emtransactionalem cache concurrency strategies for data that can be updated and there are mature, popular, production ready 2L cache providers for Hibernate Infinispan, Ehcache, Hazelcast.p  pBut I dont completely understand the difference between the emtransactionalem and emreadwriteem caches from the Hibernate documentation. I thought that the emtransactionalem cache is the only choice for a cluster application, but now after reading some topics, Im not so sure about that.p  pSo my question is about the emreadwriteem cache. Is it clustersafe Does it guarantee data synchronization between database and the cache as well as synchronization between all the connected servers Or it is only suitable for single server applications and I should always prefer the emtransactionalem cachep  pFor example, if a database transaction that is updating an entity field first name, etc. fails and has been rolled back, will the emreadwriteem cache discard the changes or it will just populate the bad data the updated first name to all the other nodes  Does it require a JTA transaction for this p  pThe a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4997620concurrencystrategyconfigurationforjbosstreecacheas2ndlevelhibernatecaConcurrency strategy configuration for JBoss TreeCache as 2nd level Hibernate cachea topic saysp  blockquote   pREADWRITE is an interesting combination. In this mode Hibernate   itself works as a lightweight XAcoordinator, so it doesnt require a   fullblown external XA. Short description of how it worksp      ol   liIn this mode Hibernate manages the transactions itself. All DB   actions must be inside a transaction, autocommit mode wont work.li   liDuring the flush which might appear multiple time during   transaction lifetime, but usually happens just before the commit   Hibernate goes through a session and searches for   updatedinserteddeleted objects. These objects then are first saved   to the database, and then locked and updated in the cache so   concurrent transactions can neither update nor read them. li   liIf the transaction is then rolled back explicitly or because of some   error the locked objects are simply released and evicted from the   cache, so other transactions can readupdate them. li   liIf the transaction is committed successfully, then the locked objects are   simply released and other threads can readwrite them.li   ol blockquote  pIs there some documentation how this works in a cluster environmentp  pIt seems that the emtransactionalem cache works correctly for this, but requires JTA environment with a standalone transaction manager such as JBossTM, Atomikos, Bitronix, XA datasource and a lot of configuration changes and testing. I managed to deploy this, but still have some issues with my frameworks. For instance, Google Guice IoC does not support JTA transactions and I have to replace it with Spring or move the service to some application server and use EJB.p  pSo which way is betterp  pThanks in advancep

In this instance, I changed a widely used interface, and want the compiler to catch the errors so that I know which implementations to fix. In addition to some of these expected errors, Intellij reports hundreds of false positives which makes it difficult to find the real errors  at present the compiler is showing only one genuine compile error each time, so I have to rebuild to find the next error....

Negative 25863 pstrongRelated Questionstrong a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1556229vectorunsignedcharvsstringforbinarydatavector ltunsigned chargt vs string for binary dataa.p  pMy code uses codevectorltunsigned chargtcode for arbitrary binary data. However, a lot of my code has to interface to Googles protocol buffers code. Protocol buffers uses codestdstringcode for arbitrary binary data. This makes for a lot of ugly allocatecopyfree cycles just to move data between Google protocol buffers and my code. It also makes for a lot of cases where I need two constructors one which takes a vector and one a string or two functions to convert a function to binary wire format.p  pThe code deals with raw structures a lot internally because structures are contentaddressable stored and retrieved by hash, signed, and so on. So its not just a matter of the interface to Googles protocol buffers. Objects are handled in raw forms in other parts of the code as well.p  pOne thing I could do is just cut all my code over to use codestdstringcode for arbitrary binary data. Another thing I could do is try to work out more efficient ways to store and retrieve my vectors into Google protocol buffer objects. I guess my other choice would be to create standard, simple, but slow conversion functions to strings and always use them. This would avoid the rampant code duplication, but would be worst from a performance standpoint.p  pAny suggestions Any better choices Im missingp  pThis is what Im trying to avoidp  precodeifSomeCase      stdvectorltunsigned chargt rawObjectobjectdata.size     memcpyamprawObject.front, objectdata.data, objectdata.size     DoSometingWithrawObject  codepre  pThe allocate, copy, process, free is completely senseless when the raw data is already sitting there.p

Negative 25863 pIm trying to use the standard MVC.Net unobtrusive JavaScript AJAX pattern as described herep  pa hrefhttpbradwilson.typepad.comblog201010mvc3unobtrusiveajax.html relnofollowhttpbradwilson.typepad.comblog201010mvc3unobtrusiveajax.htmlap  pMore specifically, the pattern might look like thisp  pIn the VIEWp  precodeusing Ajax.BeginFormaction1, controller1,     null,     new AjaxOptions              HttpMethod  POST,         OnSuccess  successHandler,     ,     new  id  formId             Html.TextBoxForm gt m.ModelItem     ltinput typesubmit valueGo gt  codepre  pI believe Ive set up the necessary elements in Web.Config, along with what appears to be working jQuery code. The action1 method on the controller is set to return a JsonResult, perhaps like thisp  pIn the responding CONTROLLER and using a MODEL not important herep  precode    public JsonResult action1MyModel model              if ModelState.IsValid                      return Jsonnew  statusCode  1                    return Jsonnew  statusCode  0       codepre  pThis pattern works great when I use modern browsers that is, the latest versions from the three major vendors. However, when I attempt to do anything with Internet Explorer 8 and presumably before, I receive a File Download  Security Warning dialog box. I believe this dialog box pops up because the browser doesnt know how to handle the contenttype produced by a JsonResult applicationjson, and so prompts the user to save the return value instead. However, changing the content type in the JsonResult method to, say, textplain or texthtml, doesnt work either. Instead,  IE8 redirects the browser window to display the raw JSON sent back. Neither of these behaviors works for me.p  pI have the sense that the problem stems from the top, which is to say that the ajaxification of an Ajax.BeginForm form simply doesnt happen in IE8, but I could be wrong, and in any case, I dont know what to do about it. p  pAny cluesp  pThanks.p
Negative 25863 pIve been using the following homegrown configuration frameworks to manage configuration of my projects for a few years nowp  ol lipThe first one mimics Javas code.propertiescode files a bunch of codesupergroup.subgroup.propertyvaluecode lines with support for collections and works fine for many situations I find its best for small applications. This one is good for very simple configuration pli lipA second based on codeDataContractSerializercode and optionally codeXmlSerializercode which allows all of the functionality of the first one with all of the perks of XML and fewer plumbing to make it work. This one is good but impractical and cumbersome to manage without an explicit UI over the top of it to mitigate the headaches of teaching end users to modify XML.pli ol  pBoth of the existing frameworks marshal to and from POCOs without issue to allow access to configuration values through propertiesfields through manualautomatic serialization respectively, so they are very easy to work with as a developer.p  pNow that I am reviewing their ability to enable database and fluent configuration, Im looking for an outofthebox preferably open source alternative. I have no problem with reworking all of my existing projects if I can reduce unnecessary code duplication and allow them access to DB and fluent configuration in addition to their existing abilities.p  pAny suggestions or is it worth rolling my own to get the features Im afterp  pIn my research I found a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3329222lookingforanetconfigurationframeworkthisa potentially duplicate question which is answered by a hrefhttpnini.sourceforge.net relnofollowNinia but it hasnt been updated in almost 2 years and only supports the options I already have covered based on its documentation anyway. Did I miss something in my research or is there a better alternativep  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pThe explicit features Im after arep  ul liXML filesli liINIJavalike codepropertiescode filesli liDatabase at least MS SQL and SQLite, optionally MySQL and any others as you could imagineli liFluent code generation not requiredli liSome sort of extension API to allow me to add my own sourcesli liIt definitely needs to serialize tofrom any of the data sources to be accessible through propertiesfields.li liEnumeration supportli ul  pId be interested in extending an existing framework if it is open enough to do what I need to do, but otherwise it probably isnt a good fit.p  hr  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pThe functionality from the existing codeSystem.Configurationcode namespace is great, and Im familiar with how well it can work but in general it doesnt do what I am looking for. Ive used it even in advanced scenarios but being that it only allows limited XML extensibility it just isnt what I am after.p  pIf I have to give on any of the predefined functionality, Id say the fluent configuration is the least important itd be extremely difficult to provide a valuable interface for this generically anyway. Ill just bolt together something on top of whatever I find.p  pThe mere fact that it has been over 24 hours and  125 views and no one has been able to offer a reasonable alterative tells me it likely doesnt exist. Ill start on my own in hopes that someone can provide an interesting alternative.p

Negative 25863 pI like jQuery validation for its simplicity and extensibility. In some of my last use cases it seemed to reach its limits though. There are some features that I am missing. My question Is there an opensource library that does support these features, or is there anything remarkable in development Or, do you have any smart hints on how to extenduse the validation framework to cover these featuresp  pMissed featuresp  ul lipFor some fields I need to define warning rules rather than erros. If they evaluate to false, a message should be displayed but it should contain a link ignore that allows the user to turn off the rule similar to MS Words spellchecker where the user can choose to ignore a spelling error. If the validation prevented the form from being sent, ideally the form is immediately sent when the user clicks ignore.pli lipThe rules should depend on the action I want to execute with the form. Whilst for one action the fields are not required yet they might be required to execute another action.pli ul  pAs an example for both cases, take a send email formp  ul liThe subject field is not necessarily required but if it is empty the user might have missed it. Ideally the validation framework blocks the form from being sent and displays a message such as You missed the subject. Ignore. By clicking Ignore the message is disabled and the form is sent.li liThe to field is definitely required for sending the email. But if the form provides a save draft button, the user should not be forced to fill in this field for saving the draft.li ul

Negative 25863 pI am trying to add RTT via FBOs to an application of mine using OpenGL via an appropriate pixel format in a C MFC application. I have copied the FBO code over from another, SDL based application of mine where RTT works. I am using glew for accessing the OpenGL driver.p  pI have extensively tested all OpenGL call results when creating, activating, deactivating and rendering the FBO, and I do not get any errors.p  pWhen switching the render buffer from GLBACK to my render FBOs color attachment however, nothing at all seems to get written to the color buffer  not even glClearColor seems to work on it.p  pIs this because the Windows pixel format doesnt allow me to render to FBOs Since the render buffer switching all goes via OpenGL I doubt this is the case, but I am absolutely clueless about why RTT doesnt work in my app.p  pAny pointer what I might need to look forp  pHeader Filep  precodeifndef FBOH define FBOH  include ltwindows.hgt include ltstddef.hgt  define MAXCOLORBUFFERS 16  typedef struct

Negative 25863 pI am trying to write a Teamcenter ITK c based program that will run as a different thread invoked from a main thread. The main thread is invoked from an action on the UI. Since the child thread takes a lot of time to complete, if i donot create the child thread and put the code in the main thread, the UI freezes for upto 10 minutes, which is not acceptable. Now both the main and child thread need to share authentication that was done by the main thread, since i am using SSO. They also need to connect to database. Lastly, the main thread should not wait for the child thread to complete, since else the whole purpose of having the child thread will be defeated. The code to invoke child thread isp  precode    handle  HANDLE beginthread submitToPublishTibcoWf, 0, ampinput  create thread do      sprintf message, Waiting d time for 1000 milliseconds since threadReady is dn, i, threadReady     logmsg message     WaitForSingleObjecthandle, 1000  while threadReady  sprintf message, Wait for thread to be ready over after d tries since threadReady is dn, i, threadReady logmsg message logmsg Main thread about to exit now codepre  pI set the threadReady  1 global variable whenever i am about to execute the piece of code in the child thread that takes 8 minutes to run.p  pNow the problem is that the child thread is behaving wierd after the main thread has exited.

Negative 25863 pIm adding functionality onto our website so that users can download files stored in a database. The problem is that I cannot properly specify the filename for the user  the user is instead prompted to save the file with the name of the main python script running the website. I am setting the ContentDisposition information but its not working as expected. Ive edited the code down to the following which still fails to workp  precodeimport sys, os import mydatabasemodule PDFReport  [...read file from database ...] printContentType applicationoctetstreamn printContentDisposition attachment filenamemytest.pdfn printreport sys.stdout.close codepre  pRunning this code prompts the user to download the file as mysite.py.

The files are small and I am trying to avoid saving them to disk but even when I do so, the same problem happens.p  p[edit] The webserver is running CentOS 5.5, Python 2.4.3, Apache 2.2.3, and modpython. Ive tested this on an Ubuntu 11.04 client using Google Chrome 17.0.963.46 beta and Firefox 13. If I instead try to show the PDF inlinep  precodeprintContenttype applicationpdfn printContentDisposition inline filenamemytest.pdfn printContentLength d  lenreport codepre  pthen Chrome shows the PDF with a plugin and Firefox asks to save the file, recognizing it as a PDF but still with the wrong filename i.e. the filename is still the script name.p  p[edit] The solution was given below by Mike. I think the problem was the newline I added in the first line above. Since print adds a newline, this second newline signaled the end of the header so the ContentDisposition line was never read.

Negative 25863 pI have a bound dataGridView with one checkbox column that is unbound. The unbound check box column is used to indicate what elements in the gridview are selected. In my forms OnLoad I go through the rows in my dataGridView and set the check box column value and the rows selected property to true, for all elements in the gridview that correspond to a element selected element. p  pThe reason why I am also setting the selected property of the rows, is because it makes the selected elements stand out better when the list of selectable items gets very long. p  pIve stepped through the process of setting the checkbox column value and the selected value of each row, and it is working the way it should and values are being set, but once the dataGridView is displayed all the selected values and checkbox values I set get reset. p  pDoes anyone know when I should be setting the cell values in my dataGridView to prevent this from happeningp

When some one paid by some way , controller calls some method of payments model , that method could be called from other controllers too.p  pThat method , does some database insert and update and at the end , it wants to send an email to user , it already has userid , but it needs username , email , which should get from users table and then send email.p  pI dont like payments model could have access to users table and I want to get info from users model and send email using email model.p  pnormally I call those from controller , I mean first call payments model and get the result and get users info from users model and then use email model , all in controller .p  pBut because I need to run that models method in some controllers , I must repeat those lines and it is not the correct aspect in my point.p  pQuestion Should I call other models inside model or use other models tables inside model in this option , if I want to reuse that model I should change it if other tables changed which is not right , or is there any other wayp  pThe main problem is not exactly that one it is just example of situation . I also defined some function which does those thing and call from controllers , but it is not right too.p

Negative 25863 pI have an application where I will be displaying a timer.p  pA user will perform an event and should complete it in a certain amount of time. I currently have a timer that shows their time ticking down, but what I want now is a total accumulated time.  So every time a new event starts, the time to complete the event is added to their accumulated time.  Then as they are performing the event, the time is ticking off the accumulated time.  p  pThis is what I have for the current timerp  precodeu.StartingTime  u.ChangeOverStandard u.CurrentChangeOverTime  u.StartingTime  DateTime.Now  u.ChangeOverStart codepre  pAll of these fields are timespans.  This works perfect for their current timerp  pBut I need a total timer that will either show a positive timespan value..if they are getting done before they are supposed to...or a negative timespan value if they are taking too long.p  pEDIT p  pSo I want to achieve thisp  pFor example  for event 1, user has 30 sec. to end. Then user has a TotalTimespan property  30. This total is decreased with the event timer. Lets say he finishes in 24 sec. That means hes got 6 sec left in TotalTimespan. Then event2 must be finished in 40 sec. So in the begining of event2, TotalTimespan  TotalTimespane6  40.  46. If user uses 60 seconds, then TotalTimespan  46 60  14.p  pThe timer is not a timer, and cant be used as a timer.  It is running on a background worker which is doing several other calculations as well.  So I cant just take off the time one second at a time. p  pOn each new event, Ive triedp  precodeu.AccumulatedTime  u.ChangeOverStandard codepre  pand thenp  precodeu.AccumulatedTime  u.StartingTime  DateTime.Now  u.ChangeOverStart codepre  pBut obviously that isnt going to work because it is taking the total elapsed time from the accumulated time every round through my loopp  precodeDateTime.Now  u.ChangeOverStart codepre  pWill give me the elapsed time from the beginning of the event to now, so is this what Im wanting p  precodeu.AccumulatedTime  DateTime.Now  u.ChangeOverStart codepre

Negative 25863 pI am developing an iOS application that needs to talk to a web server backend. My intention is to develop web services using ASP.NET WCF.p  pOn the iOS side I am using RESTKit to access the web services. p  pI have read many many different articles, and questions here on stack overflow, and struggled to find a definitive answer to my needs. I can imagine this is quite a common scenario, so I thought I would post a question to clarify this issue for both me and anyone else with this problem.p  pI need to authenticate the request between the iOS app and the ASP.NET services, and oAuth seems a good way to go. At first I started reading into oAuth 2 Legged, and managed to get a working implementation  by following this tutorial  a hrefhttpwww.cleancode.co.nzblog523oauthdotnet relnofollowhttpwww.cleancode.co.nzblog523oauthdotneta I followed the second option in this tutorial.p  pThis worked great but provided me with no way to know which user the request was on behalf of. I then realised that maybe standard 3 legged oAuth was for me. p  pI stumbled upon DevDefined.OAuth.WCF and DotNetOpenAuth. Both seem to be lacking in comprehensive documentation.p  pI tried to follow along with the DotNetOpenAuth provider example, but am struggling to understand how it works.p  pSo my questionsp  pDoes anybody know of a good explanation of setting up an oAuth provider using ASP.NET, and securing WCF web services using oAuth.p  pAm I going about this the right way, is oAuth for mep  pHow will oAuth work when the iOS app and server are both coded by me I dont want the user to have to grant access to this app. It should be automatic when they enter there login details.p  pI really appreciate any time anyone can put aside to help me with this It has been driving me crazy for a couple of weeks.p  pThanks and Best Regards Matthew Caseyp  pPS.

Negative 25863 pCurrently expensively parsing a file, which generates a dictionary of 400 key, value pairs, which is seldomly updated. Previously had a function which parsed the file, wrote it to a text file in dictionary syntax ie. codedict  Adam Room 430, Bob Room 404code etc, and copied and pasted it into another function whose sole purpose was to return that parsed dictionary. p  pHence, in every file where I would use that dictionary, I would import that function, and assign it to a variable, which is now that dictionary. Wondering if theres a more elegant way to do this, which does not involve explicitly copying and pasting code around Using a database kind of seems unnecessary, and the text file gave me the benefit of seeing whether the parsing was done correctly before adding it to the function. But Im open to suggestions.p

Negative 25863 pIve seen similar questions but nothing that directly addresses the challenge Im facing...p  pFirst, I generally create my WCF client proxies manually because I just find them easier to deal with in the long run.  However, this isnt really an option when dealing with WCF Data Services and EF because so much is done behind the scenes...p  pIn my scenario I have a WCF service that calls a WCF Data Service.  The calling service receives data from a client which passes entity objects generated by EF.  These entity objects are in an assembly referenced by the data service also.p  pWhen I generate a client proxy in VS2010, the objects are put in a different namespace so I can do a direct cast from the data object received from the client to the proxy class.  To resolve this Ive modified the proxys reference.cs file and changed the namespace... that seems to work but generates a ton of conflict warnings...p  pDoes anyone have a cleaner way to do this  I dont mind generating the proxy manually with some guidance because it looks pretty complex.p  pThanks, KBWp  pAdditional Information... below is the warning message I receive from the wrapper service after I changed the namespace in the WCF Data service client proxy.p  pThe type AW.Data.Demo.Contact in CAzureTutorialsMyFirstAzureProjectawEntityDataawEntityDataService ReferencesAWEntityModelReference.cs conflicts with the imported type Maevva.iSvr.Data.Demo.Contact in cAssembliesAWDataModelLib.dll.

Negative 25863 pI have an AJAX call that binds to the window popstate event.  It works, except that Im parsing the arguments from the querystring.  The problem is the ajax call is bound to the window when the page loads, so my arguments dont change when the url does.

Negative 25863 pSo this tutorial that I am using is not being as straight forward as I am hoping for. The next step requires the followingp  pWe need to create a class implementing abstract LocationListener class. This class will be registered with Location Manager to receive updates of location. We need to override all four methods of this class, namely onLocationChanged, onProviderDisabledEnabled, and onStatusChanged. As we are just interested in getting location updates, we will modify the code of onLocationChanged to navigate to the new location received in the map view. This is achieved by calling animateTo method of MapController.p  pI would just like a little bit of advice as to if its a class I need to create on my own newClass method, or is it just code I am supposed to add into another file. p

Negative 25863 pMy team are doing with 2 teams server team and client team. We at server team will provide APIs for the client team to call. The APIs have many version, so that we need to match the server build and the respective client build  for example, the old client will refuse to work if the server build number is much larger than its support version and requires an update.p  pBecause of the above reason, we need to send back the build version of server to client. Currently we are doing this by adding a static field in a Config class. But Im concerned with the fact that we must manually increase it everytime a new server is built  especially when we do daily build. This process is quite errorprone and not quite elegant.p  pIn my search, I see many propose for using maven plugins to manage the build version. Though I highly appreciated the autoprocess, it still doesnt let the server know the build number. Server application should be able to return its build version to client through an API call.p  pI have thought of write the number version somewhere remote database, files on server.  strongIs there any way to make the building process automatically increase the build version, but the application itself can retrieve this number in running alsostrongp  pWe are using Maven build and having Jenkin as the integration build server.p

Negative 25863 pGood day,p  pI have been having a problem with a bit of simple VBA.  I wrote a script to take a text query with no input parameters so no real user interaction, SQL Injection, etc., run it against a database, and dump it to a new worksheet.  This is a simple oneoff for some developer analysis so the features are extremely simple.p  pIf the query returns values for every column, there is no problem.  However, if the query has any null values in it as the result of a ROLLUP, in my case, the entire subroutine will fail at MoveNext NOTE not the assignment of the null value to a cell.  Originally, the script was failing before the null row was ever even accessed at p  precodeRangeCells2, 1, CellsrsData.RecordCount  1, rsData.Fields.Count.NumberFormat   codepre  pThis was commented and moved to be cellbycell with the intent of adding a check if the current cell is null by far the most common suggestion on the internet.p  pThe queries have been verified using a backend SQL editor and are correct.  Every other article that I have read has either been specific to a product or not applicable.  The question, then, is simply how is one supposed to handle null values in a Recordset  I would like to avoid removing the nulls on the database side, as this sub is used for many different queries and the thought of having to pepper my queries with a bunch of NVL statements is quite displeasing.p  pThank you in advance for any assistance.

Negative 25863 pSo Ive implemented a version for quick sort but Im not sure if I did it in an optimal way. The elements in the vector that I am sorting are 3D points. You will notice that when splitting the array it says iflevel  1, iflevel  2, etc This is because depending on when Im calling quicksort, either the x, y, or z coordinate of the points is the basis of the sorting. p  pMy code is below. Ive tested my algorithm and it seems to be sorting the points correctly, however I feel like I may have a lot of overhead or something because it doesnt run as fast as I hoped it would run, especially since I have to call this sort function many times to sort arrays as large as 500,000 elements. p  pIs there anything I can do to improveclean upspeed up my sort algorithmp  precodestdvectorltPointgt SortPointsstdvectorltPointgt points, int level      ifpoints.size lt 1 return points     stdvectorltPointgt s1, s2     sizet index  floatrandRANDMAXpoints.size1     Point pivot  points[index]     points.erasepoints.begin  index     sizet size  points.size     forint i  0 i lt size i              iflevel  1                      ifpoints[i].pos.x lt pivot.pos.x s1.pushbackpoints[i]             else s2.pushbackphotons[i]          else iflevel  2                      ifpoints[i].pos.y lt pivot.pos.y s1.pushbackpoints[i]             else s2.pushbackphotons[i]          else iflevel  3                      ifpoints[i].pos.z lt pivot.pos.z s1.pushbackpoints[i]             else s2.pushbackphotons[i]                   ifs1.size  0 return Concatenates1, pivot, s2      else ifs2.size  0 return Concatenates1, pivot, s2     else return ConcatenateSortPointss1, level, pivot, SortPointss2, level    stdvectorltPointgt ConcatenatestdvectorltPointgt s1,                                         Point p, stdvectorltPointgt s2        stdvectorltPointgt result     result.reserves1.sizes2.size1     result.insertresult.end, s1.begin, s1.end     result.pushbackp     result.insertresult.end, s2.begin, s2.end     return result  codepre

Negative 25863 pSo I was very surprised to see that when you add the codeignorecasecode option to codegrepcode that it can slow down the search by 50x times. Ive tested this on two different machines with the same result. I am curious to find out an explanation for the huge performance difference. I would also like to see an alternative command to grep for case insensitive searches. I dont need regular expressions just fixed string searching.

Negative 25863 pNew to Android and OpenCV. Been trying to to implement code from new book, emMastering OpenCV with Practical Computer Vision Projectsem.

Negative 25863 pI think I have a fundamental issue with these new constraints.p  pImagine you put 5 labels all going from top to bottom in a UIView.  The top label is equally spaced between the top of the view and the next label underneath it.  Then each label is also equally spaced.p  pWhat I would like to happen is that when the UIView height is made less or more the space between each label changes equallyp  pWhat should I be aiming for.  Should I make the 3rd label vertically centred in the view and then add constraints to the other labels from the centre or should 1 and 2 be constrained to the top of the view, 3 centre and 4 and 5 to the bottomp  pThanks in advance for all your suggestions.p  pstrongEditstrong After the below answer was added I have played around with the constraints in interface builder and whilst I am not 100 sure I have answered it I think I have it working.p  pBetween all labels I have a certain distance.  But I also have a certain minimum distance like following apples HIG I think it is 15 between labels.  So mine are at 30 and I set a constraint of greater than or equal to 15.  Now iOS does all the moving around from 30 to 15 for me when the superview changes.p

Negative 25863 pIm writing a page in php index.php, say which uses an external php script do.php, say called through the jQuery code.postcode function.p  pI am passing a post variable called doit which determines what the script will do. For example, if doit is 1, it assigns an unique id to the user and stores it in a cookie called uid with the setcookie function. If doit is 2, it inputs another post data called msg into a table, that it creates by the name tuid. Eg. If uid is 14, it creates a table called t14 and puts msg in it.p  pI use the following line of code to set the cookiep  precodesetcookieuid, val, time3600,  codepre  pAnd this line of code to create the tablep  precodeq  create table t.COOKIE[uid]. sl int primary key autoincrement, msg varchar1000, seen int mysqlqueryq codepre  pNow my problem is this The sql query is executed correctly, but I dont get any value from the cookie variable. The table created is simply named t.p  pMy question is What am I doing wrong What should I do so that I get a value correctlyp  pP.S When I check the cookies set by my page, I see the cookie there. I tried clearing the cookies and trying again, but each time, the cookie is set correctly, but not the table.p  pThere is also another problem. The sql queries are executed only after i refresh the page. For example, I have another table called uu in which I store the uid of the current user and some other info. The last row in that table contains the previous uid and not the present one. If uid is 10 this time, and i refresh the page and get uid as 11, only then does the info for uid  10 is updated in the table uu.p  pAny help at all is greatly appreciated  Thanks.p
Negative 25863 pIm developing a PHPservice which does numerous operations per customer, and I want this to run continuously. Ive already taken a look at cron, but as far as I understood cron made it possible to run the code on set times. This can be a bit dangerous since we are dependant that the code has finished running before it starts over, and the time for each run may vary as the customer base increases. So refresh, cron or other timed intervals cant be done, as far as Im aware.p  pSo Im wondering if you know any solutions where I can restart my service when it is finished, and under no circumstances make the rerun before all the code have been executed p  pIm sorry if this is answered before or is easily found on Google, I have tried to find something, but to no avail.p  pEdit I could set timed intervals to be 1 hour, to be absolutely sure, but I want as little time as possible between each run.p

Negative 25863 pI am working on a graphical board game program that is based on a main JFrame. The game board itself is derived from JPanel. p  pI want to be able to display a victory screen over the whole window when someone wins. I figured I could extend this idea from a welcome screen that I was able to successfully display in the beginning. When this code runs, the welcome screen appears, stays up for 2 seconds, and then goes away, with the game board appearing and ready to play. Hopefully, these basic parts will be enough information on how I have it set upp  precodepublic class MyGame        public static Board b                Board extends JPanel   public static Window gameWindow      Window extends JFrame   ...   public static void mainString args[] throws IOException     ...     gameWindow  new WindowMy Game      DisplayScreen extends JPanel     DisplayScreen intro  new DisplayScreenwelcomeScreen.png      gameWindow.setSize960, 570      gameWindow.addintro      gameWindow.setVisibletrue      wait2 just a function I wrote      ...     b  new Boardboard.png      ...      gameWindow.removeintro       gameWindow.addb      gameWindow.repaint      gameWindow.setVisibletrue      ...      ...   codepre  pAdmittedly, it took a lot of trial and error to get this to work. For the life of me, though, I cannot figure out how to temporarily put up the victory screen at some point later in the game. I thought I could do this through a function in the central codeMyGamecode class I have tried it in the codeWindowcode class and elsewhere, without success. Something likep  precodepublic static void VictoryScreen     DisplayScreen victoryScreen  new DisplayScreenvictoryScreen.jpg        victoryScreen.setVisibletrue      gameWindow.addvictoryScreen   codepre  pThis, unfortunately, displays nothing. I have tried all manner of codeaddcode, codesetVisiblecode, codevalidatecode , etc., and looked through some other questions, but nothing seems to work. I also tried having the codevictoryScreencode declared right alongside the initial welcome screen and setting it nonvisible then just setting visible when I want to display it, but this just puts a gray panel over everything in the very beginning. It seems like when something is constructed, it gets automatically drawn. Having the board as another JPanel layer seems pretty risky as it is, but I know very little about JSwing. p  pAt any rate, I am stumped. Any suggestions on a procedure to make the victory screen and eventually others show up as desired  p  pEDIT Here is the way I overrode codepaintComponentcode for the screen display classp  precodepublic void paintComponentGraphics g                 works fine for welcome screen       g.drawImagescreenImage, 0, 0, 960, 540, null        repaint   codepre

The MDX being run is as followsp  precode  SELECT [Measures].[AMOUNT] on 0,            Filter [DIM1].MEMBERS, [DIM1].CurrentMember NOT IN [DIM1].[A], [DIM1].[B], [DIM1].[C] on 1,          [DIM2].[S] on 2,           [DIM3].[EFO] on 3,           [CURRENCY].[EUR] on 4   from [CUBE] codepre  pBut Measures.AMOUNT is still taking  Dim1.A, Dim1.B and Dim1.C into consideration. Could you kind folks please point out what is wrong with my syntax. I have also tried the Except, . p  pBest, Rohanp  pUPDATE p  pThanks to Marc , for pointing me in the right direction. I tested some more and found out that the Members function also returns a point All which includes all the points on my dimension. So hence, even though the Filter or the Except functions were filtering the points properly, the All point still contained the value for all points and hence was including them in the Measure.AMOUNT calculation. I instead used the Children function and that does not return the All point so I see the desired result.

Then I zipped up all my games textures without any compression setting, renamed the zip file top  precodemain.1.com.baller.fivesome.obb codepre  pI then placed the obb file into the appropriate place a hrefhttpwww.ballerindustries.comimagespath.png relnofollowhttpwww.ballerindustries.comimagespath.pngap  pMy code crashing while trying to open up the OBB filep  precodeusingZipFile zif  new ZipFilesourcePath codepre  pHeres the contents of sourcePath a hrefhttpwww.ballerindustries.comimagessourcePath.png relnofollowhttpwww.ballerindustries.comimagessourcePath.pngap  pIt results in a Java.IO.FileNotFoundExceptionp  pSo I guess my questions are 1.

Negative 25863 pI am wondering if node.js is good for server side application wich is not actually communicating with browser, or browser communication is just an additional part of whole app used rather for management.p  pThe idea is simple p  ol lipServer receives high amount of UDP traffic with short messages containing user data from another server. pli lipFor each message app performs DB lookup and filter out messages with userids that are not on the whitelist.pli lipFiltered messages are processed, wich result in another DB update, or sending data to another server.pli ol  pIs such case, a good scenario to learn node.js, or maybe there is no benefit from it comparing to e.g Java EEp
Negative 25863 pI have an app that available for worldwide distribution.  It doesnt support localization at the moment, though maybe 5 of downloads come from countries where English is not the primary language though, likely spoken and understood.p  pI just yesterday submitted an inapp purchase for the app that has its own tab on the primary tabViewController.  The tab is always there.  If a person has not purchased the IAP, a store like view controller is presented that lets the user see if they want to purchase it.  If the person has purchased the IAP, then they get to use the feature they have unlocked.p  pThe IAP I setup only has an English version.  Is this permissible for an app that is distributed worldwide when the tab that offers the premium feature is displayed no matter what  Or should the app be distributed only to countries where English is the primary language until I decide to localize it.  Im just curious if it will get rejected solely for this reason, or if people who download the app in a country where English is not the primary language will be assumed to speak English and still see the IAP.p  pMaybe Im overthinking this, but I didnt want to wait through the entire review process when its documented somewhere that this will be rejected I couldnt find it if it is.  Thanks for the help.p

Negative 25863 pI usually develop mobile apps for iOS and Android and I am used to launching projects repeatedly without asking if another instance is running or not, since the simulators will handle this for me.p  pWhen I use Eclipse to develop desktop apps, I face this problem since running multiple times the same project will result in multiple different instances. I would like Eclipse to be able to kill the previouslyopened processes before running the new one. Ive found a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions177189howtoimplementasingleinstancejavaapplicationthis questiona, but this one addresses the problem to let a single instance of a Java application run, but this is not quite the point. I do not care if the final release will run one or two times, I just want to be able to run a single instance when developing, seamlessly like Xcode or Eclipse for Android do. Moreover, that solution will popup an alert when running the same project twice, but thats not a solution for me. Kill and run, that it.p  pIs it possible to change the run configuration of the project to achieve this without changing the source code, or is this achievable with a plugin or whatelse I would like to find a completely automated solution that could make me work as if I were under Xcode.p

Negative 25863 pI originally thought when a queue is destructed e.g. when it goes out of scope, then the contained elements should be destructed by calling their respective destructor. Similarly, when pop is called, the first element in the queue is destructed and the queues size is reduced by 1. p  pHowever, when I verified my understanding, it seems incorrect... I used something like thisp  precodestringamp str  myQueue.front myQueue.pop codepre  pwhere myQueue is a nonempty queue containing strings.p  pAccording to codefrontcode spec, it should return a reference to the first element it holds, a hrefhttpwww.cplusplus.comreferencequeuequeuefront relnofollowas seen herea.p  pThis means, when I pop the queue, the first element is gone. It turns out str is still a valid string afterwardsp  pIs there something wrongp  pThanksp

Negative 25863 pThis may be a duplicate question, but none of the questions I found were exactly what I had in mind.p  pA friend and I want to create an App that lets the user play around with 3D objects on the screen. My friend is creating the objects and the animations in Blender or Maya. Therefore, the possible animations will be preset not being programmatically animated. I have no experience in 3D programming and I naively suggested that he render the animations in Blender and send me all the frames. I would then play the appropriate animation by quickly running through all the frames. Each animation would leave the object in its original position so that it would be ready for the next animation. p  pNow that Ive been thinking about it, thats a lot of images that I have to store in order to make this work. For every object, I would need to have all its frames for all of its animations, which maybe overkill. p  pIs there another way to play animations in an Android app I considered just saving the animations as videos and playing them, but that would look horrible for our purpose. p

Negative 25863 pFor example, I have the numbers 46,47,54,58,60, and 66. I want to make group them in such a way as to make the largest possible group sizes. Numbers get grouped if their values are within plus or minus 10 inclusive. So, depending on which number you start with, for this example there can be three possible outcomes shown in the image. p  pWhat I want is the second possible outcome, which would occur if you started with 54, as the numbers within 44 to 64 would be grouped, leaving 66 by itself, and creating the largest group 5 items. p  pI realize I could easily brute force this example, but I really have a long list of numbers and it needs to do this across thousands of numbers.. Can anyone tell me about algorithms I should be reading about or give me suggestions Thanksp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comKGjGC.png altenter image description herep
Negative 25863 pI created an asp.net page for waiting ajax. I have one page creating something that takes 30 seconds.

But, I dont know why, my ajax page awaits the end of the creation of my first page. So I only get the 100 at the end.p  pMaybe its because I use VS development server and not IIS server.

Negative 25863 pSuppose we have an already existing file, say codeltFilegtcode. This file has been opened by a C program for update coderbcode. We use codefseekcode to navigate to a point inside codeltFilegtcode, other than the end of it. Now we start writing data using codefwritefputccode. Note that we dont delete any data previously existing in codeltFilegtcode...p  pHow does the system handle those writes Does it strongrewrite the whole file to another position in the Diskstrong, now containing the new data Does it strongfragment the file and write only the new data in another positionstrong and just remember that in the middle there is some free space Does it actually strongoverwrite in place only the part that has changedstrongp  pThere is a good reason for asking In the first case, if you continuously update a file, the system can get slow. In the second case, it could be faster but will mess up the File System if done to many files. In the third case, especially if you have a solid state Disk, updating the same spot of a File over and over again may render that part of the Disk useless.p  pActually, thats where my question originates from. Ive read that, to save Disk Sectors from overuse, Solid State Disks move Data to less used sectors, using different techniques. But how exactly does the codestdiocode functions handle such situationsp  pThanks in advance for your time Dp

Negative 25863 pFrom my understanding, the return value from a factorys tocreate method is ignored. This means that the object returned from the build or initializewith portion of the factory is the object ultimately returned when calling create within a test.p  pIn my case, I am using a variant of the Repository Pattern. I am overriding the tocreate portion of the factory to include a call to a repository save method. This method does not modify the given object, but returns an object representing the persisted form of the original.p  pHowever, the instance returned from the build block is returned from the factory, and not the instance created in the tocreate block. In my code, this means the unpersisted form of the object is returned, not the object with updated attributes e.g. id from the saving action.p  pIs there a way of forcing the return value of create to be either the result of the tocreate block or some value generated within that blockp  precodeclass Foo   attraccessor id, name   ... end  class FooRepository   def self.createname     Foo.newname  this object is not yet persisted and has no .id   end    def self.savefoo      this method must not guarantee that the original Foo instance      will always be returned     ...     updatedfoo  this is a duplicate of the original object   end    ... end  FactoryGirl.define do   factory foo, class FooRepository do      create an example Foo     initializewith  FooRepository.createname Example       save the Foo to the datastore, returning what may be a duplicate     tocreate instance FooRepository.saveinstance   end end  describe FooRepository do   it saves the given Foo to the datastore do     foo  createfoo     foo.id gt nil     ...   end end codepre

Negative 25863 pIn my android app, I have a search field where the user can type something.

Negative 25863 pSo.. Native Magento only exports data if a product has been sold. We all know this, we all have used it, dealt with it, loathed it at some point in time.. p  pI need to be able to generate a report that shows ALL items by quantity sold, to include those that have never sold  0, or zero quantity sold . Were doing this so that I can pull some items off of the website that rarely sell, or never sell, so that we arent manufacturing onsies and twosies. p  pI understand data needs to be populated to run the report and the search query bases it off whatever items have a 1 or greater  BUT the data is still present there just is not an order associated with it, thus never setting it within the applicable limits of the report query.p  pIs there a way to modify the search query to include these neversold items, or any other methodp  pI am on Magento Enterprise 1.12.02, but the report templatesmethods should be similar across the board  if not ive managed to replicate them in the past.p

Negative 25863 pIm using this great feature in LESS called a hrefhttplesscss.orgnestedmediaqueries relnofollownested media queriesa that allows me to keep styles related to each module in one place.

I now have a separate IE stylesheet containing the desktop styles.

Negative 25863 pIs there a shortened label typedef defined for unsiged integer that works across mostall platforms I see uint or UINT alot in Windows, but understand this is not consistently implemented on other platforms. Im happy to type unsigned int for every instance, but if theres a standard typedef like uint, although thats not consistently implemented, Ill use it. I suspect this is not the case after doing a bit of research, but people may have some knowledge of eg. C11 etc., or standard headers across nixWindows that implement the same label. Im not much interested in strictly specifying the bit size of unsigned int its used for low iteration loops only.p

After I verified that I have the certificate I want to retrieve the user details ie. implement the loadUserByUsername and read the userId from the request header supplied by the client and NOT use the supplied DN from the certificate.

loaded as a subview into another view that belongs to a scroll view. I can manually set the contentSize as well as the views height, just the detailViewController doesnt seem to want to take the 9000 height or perhaps something else is the culprit.p

Do I need to search all the Windows that currently open and then select the right one and get a handle to it. Also what if I have multiple instances of Visual Studio running, how would I get a handle to the correct one p  pEDIT It seemed sensible to add the actual problem here upon reflection and advice in the comments I have a multiple monitor set up and different instances of visual running on each. I am trying to get the console produced when debugging to appear on the same monitor as the instance of visual studio that generated it so that both consoles do not overlap each other when they are generated.p

Negative 25863 pIve been using CodeIgniter for a few months and recently discovered Bonfire, which looks like a great foundation for CI projects, despite the current build using almost outdated resources like Bootstrap 2.p  pI really love the module system in Bonfire, it seems like a very efficient method for creating completely independent subsystems. However, I wonder how compatible these modules would be with a normal CodeIgniter installation. Obviously you cant just dump the modules folder in, CI wouldnt know what to do with it, but is there any way to restructure a BF module into a third party plugin or something that can be used in CIp  pSimilarly, would it be possible to extract files from a CI installation and package them as a BF module obviously with some tweakingp  pI would imagine the answer to those questions would probably be of course not, so I just want to make my understanding clear if I decide to develop with Bonfire, I would essentially be stuck using it without being able to revert to vanilla CodeIgniter and I would only be able to share my modules with other Bonfire users.

Negative 25863 pIm building a system that comprises a multiple heterogeneous services that talk to each other over a network, although in the standard deployment model they are all on the same machine. The UI client for managing the entities within that complex system should be able to display aggregated data from all comprising services while enabling search across that aggregated data.p  pIm wondering how to design the data retrieval within this system so that it is scalable as the amount of data to be searched is already high and increasesp  pIm thinking about two approachesp  ol lipThe client queries data from all services on demand and aggregates the results in its layer. In many cases it  will have to do joins between data coming from multiple services, so Im concerned about performance here.pli lipDenormalize the services data in a way so that it is convenient for the client queries and even store aggregations between the multiple services data so that the client doesnt have to do joins on demand. Probably, it would be better to store each services denormalized data in its own database or cache as thus it would be easier to keep all denormalized data uptodate. However, Ill need to put the aggregated views across multiple services data in some other place and Im concerned about the  overhead of keeping this remote cache uptodate.pli ol  pAny examples or references to existing architectures that solve similar problems would be highly appreciated.

Negative 25863 pFor partial updating my composite components, I have some problems finding the correct parent IDs. e.g. if my component is inside of a tabViewp  precodeltptabView idfoogt         ltptabgt             ltstgmycomponent idbar gt         ltptabgt ltptabViewgt codepre  pNow I need the String codefoobarcode to find the correct parts, that I want to update. Via codecc.idcode I just get codebarcode, so this does not work for me.p  pHowever, I tried to achieve this by some kind of dirty hack by adding a attribute to my component like thisp  precodeltcompositeattribute    nameparentId    defaultcomponent.namingContainer.parent.namingContainer.clientId gt codepre  pIf I hand over the String codefoobarcode to codeparentIdcode everything works fine, but of course thats not what I really want to do. I do not want to force the user of my component to hand over this ID.p  pBut now the problem If I do not hand over a parentId, I only can use my attribute in the first level of my component. If there are some kind of nested IDs then codecc.attrs.parentIdcode is evaluated e.g. to codefoobarcode which is nice but also codefoobarfooBarcode or somethin like that, depending on where codecc.attrs.parentIdcode is located in my code. p  pI hope its comprehensible what my problem is and what I am exactly asking for.

Negative 25863 pI have a system where I am able to collect 8bit Gray images from a camera, place the data into a WriteableBitmap and display the images on a WPF Image object. This work happens in a camera thread. I used this article to help me a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions16220472howtocreateabitmapimagefromapixelbytearraylivevideodisplayHow to create a BitmapImage from a pixel byte array live video displayap  pWhat I am trying to to do is make a copy of a subset of the pixel data of the image data. During the frame update in the camera thread I am trying to create the copy of the data in a separate byte array. My code appears to work at first, but then after a few iterations my buffer variable goes from having a range of grey levels 0255 to only having values of 255 in every array element. The variable appears to accumulate data and max out as opposed to reset each time the background worker is called. I will present my code below. p  pCan anyone see and describe to me what I am doing wrong Thank you.p  precodepublic partial class MainWindow  Window      [DllImportKernel32.dll,EntryPointRtlMoveMemory]     public static extern void CopyMemoryIntPtr Destination, IntPtr Source,          uint Length         Declarations      var pData  Marshal.AllocHGlobalMarshal.SizeOftypeofbyteFrameSize     var pFocusData  Marshal.AllocHGlobalMarshal.SizeOftypeofbyte            FrameSize      BackgroundWorker bw  new BackgroundWorker     static CameraWorker cWorker     static Thread cThread      WriteableBitmap wbm     public IntPtr wbmBackBuffer     const int FrameSize  19442592       CameraWorker Event Handler     void CWFrameUpdatedobject sender, CameraWorkerEventArgs e             if e.Updated return         e.pData is an IntPtr containing the camera frame data        CopyMemorythis.wbmBackBuffer, e.pData, FrameSize        this.Dispatcher.Invokewbm.Lock        this.Dispatcher.Invokegt wbm.AddDirtyRect             new Int32Rect0,0,wbm.PixelWidth,wbm.PixelHeight         this.Dispatcher.Invokewbm.Unlock          The above works and I get streaming data to my view port.          Now I want to make a copy of the pixel data to send to another thread         for processing. This is where I am having trouble.         if bw.IsBusy return        CopyMemorypFocusData, e.pData, FrameSize        var args  new Listltobjectgt        args.AddpFocusData        bw.RunWorkerAsyncargs            BackgroundWorker event handlers      void bwDoWorkobject sender, DoWorkEventArgs e               This is where I see the result of the problem when debugging.

I extract a subregion from the byte array to process, however after a          couple of iterations, all values in fullFrame equal 255. The pData that          is coming in should be a copy of the pixel data that is being displayed          on the screen. While the screen keeps updating with a live video image,          the frameData variable appears to keep accumulating rather than resetting          with each backgroundworker call.             void bwRunWorkerCompletedobject sender, RunWorkerCompletedEventArgs e               Update UI elements using Dispatcher with data obtained during DoWork.

It was just a transcription error on my part in showing the relevant portion of my code. p  pEDIT 2 p  pem1 What happens if you do your BW stuff after if e.Updated return line Will the wbm start having this accumulation error and your BW will be fineemp  pThere is no difference in behavior. The wbm is still fine and my BW variable accumulates.p  p2 BackgroundWorker.IsBusy property will be false after bwDoWork is finished. Are you okay with this behaviorp  pMy intent was to only process a new frame when the BW was finished. I thought that IsBusy lasts until RunWorkerCompleted is run I dont need to process every frame. p  pI tried to simply create a new BW for every call to CWFrameUpdated, but that did not solve the problem either.p  pem3 What does the MoveMemory do Does it copy memory from SOURCE to DESTINATION without changing anything in SOURCE Does it even copy anythingemp  pRtlMoveMemory CopyMemory is supposed to copy bytes from one area of memory to the other. I thought that by having allocated two separate spaces of equal size by the AllocHGlobal function I could do a rapid copy of the 8MB of data from one variable to the other. From what I have been reading it appears that I am doing something that the managed memory does not like. I need a fast deep copy of the data. I will try System.Buffer.BlockCopy again in case I missed something the first time. p  pem4 What buffer variable are you speaking about On every stage, verify ALL BUFFERS and nail down the EXACT place where the buffers differ. You need to create function DumpMemoryIntPtr unmanagedMemory. You can cast IntPtr to byteem and use fixed statement to do so.p  pI will set up the DumpMemory function and let you know what I find. In the meantime, here is the data flow and roster of relevant variables. p  ppData IntPtr unmanaged memory containing 19442592 bytes of image data in Gray8 format with no headerp  pwbm WriteableBitmap WPF variable that is bound to an Image object on the main windowp  pwbmBackBuffer IntPtr local variable that points to the same location as the wbm.BackBufferp  ppData is copied to wbmBackBuffer using CopyMemory, and because wbm is bound to the Image object, the current image frame is updated on the main windowp  ppFocusData IntPtr this is a local pointer that is allocated memory in the size of a full frame of datap  ppData is copied to pFocusData through CopyMemory.p  pfullFrame byte [] this is a byte array copy of pFocusData. This is where I see the accumulation occur. p  pEDIT 3 I finally solved the issue. It turns out there was a logic error in the subarrays I was selecting. My view port is about 800400 while the image array is about 3.5 times larger. I did not scale the coordinates properly, so my sample regions were all looking at a small and similar region of the frame data. I was able to notice this by following the 4th suggestion and using a memory dump to see exactly what was going on at each step. It helped me see that nothing was wrong with the code ultimately and what I thought was accumulation was actually just the camera saturating in a small region. p  pThe good news is that the code posted above is correct and works. I ultimately ended up using Buffer.BlockCopy and created a duplicate frame that I pass through the camera worker event args. p  pThank you very much for your help ErtiChris Eelmaap

Negative 25863 pHeres the thing, I have a stored procedure which must select products from the database, but only those which fit in between the start product code, and the finish product code which the user chooses and get sent to the procedure.p  pNow the product codes are varchars, and they may contain numbers AND letters, like code01code, code01Bcode and code02Acode may be product codes, and the procedure must be able to select all the values in between the user selected ranges. p  pIm having trouble with such where clause doing it like thisp  precode... SELECT ... WHERE ... AND  ProductCode gt IniProCod  AND   ProductCode lt FinProCod ... codepre  pThe available product codes are shown to the user via a previous query which returns only available product codes, so there should be no problem with non existant values.p  pI also tried evaluating them as text, although they are received as varchars by the procedure anyway, and since this is inside a dynamic SQL query it actually looks something like thisp  precode... SELECT ... WHERE ... AND  ProductCode gt IniProCod  AND   ProductCode lt FinProCod ... codepre  pAnd when I try to execute it it returns either the first row, or a set of rows that has very little to nothing to do with the actual values Im sending to the procedure, so I dont even think its comparing the values as strings at all.p  pI leave out code that has nothing to do with the issue, the query actually works alright without this range where clause.p  pSo any ideasp  pstrongEditstrongp  pI also tried using BETWEEN but got the same outcome.p  pAnd Im very certain it is just not comparing the variables as text even when they are declared as varchars and Im using apostrophes on them, and this is only happening on this procedure. I tested this same clause on a clean select query and it does behave as it should, comparing each character for what they are. If I set the initial values as code0code and code29code respectively it will give me a range from code01code to code29code which are the values contained within that range, but when these same values are given to the stored procedure it will return a range from code01code which is the first value, to code03Fcode, which makes no sense to me.p

It goes through multiple ArrayLists to show all the objects on the JFrame.p  precodePainting  public void paintComponentGraphics g               Paint the background with its upper left corner at the upper left corner of the panel         g.drawImagebackground, 0, 0, null          Paint each image in the foreground where it should go         forMovingImage img  backgrounds                      g.drawImageimg.getImage, intimg.getX, intimg.getY, null                  forMovingImage img  foreground                      g.drawImageimg.getImage, intimg.getX, intimg.getY, null                   ifg instanceof Graphics2D                      Graphics2D g2  Graphics2Dg             g2.setRenderingHintRenderingHints.KEYANTIALIASING,             RenderingHints.VALUEANTIALIASON             g2.scale2, 2             g2.setColorColor.WHITE              String milSpace             iftimer100 lt 10                 milSpace  0             else                 milSpace                String secSpace             iftimer100 lt 10                 secSpace  0             else                 secSpace                g2.drawStringsecSpace  timer100    milSpace  timer100, 10, 20              Debug             ifdebug                              long currentTime  System.currentTimeMillis                 if currentTime gt nextSecond                                      nextSecond  1000                     frameInLastSecond  framesInCurrentSecond                     framesInCurrentSecond  0                                  framesInCurrentSecond                 g2.drawStringLagMS  frameRate  10   FPS  frameInLastSecond, 20, 40   ltincludes lag                 g2.drawStringFPS  frameInLastSecond, 20, 40                                  Replaces the list of foreground images with the one given, and repaints the panel     public void updateImagesArrayListltMovingImagegt newForeground, ArrayListltMovingImagegt newBackgrounds              foreground  newForeground         backgrounds  newBackgrounds         time checking         long time  System.currentTimeMillis         lastTime  time          repaint  This repaints stuff... you dont need to know how it works      codepre  pInside the primary class I made that includes a tick system, which causes it to be painted in the first place.p  precodepublic void tick              long lastTime  System.currentTimeMillis          int place  0         boolean go  true         whilego                      long time  System.currentTimeMillis The current time             iftime  10 gt lastTime    Update every .01 seconds, or 1 TICK if time  10 gt lastTime                              lastTime  time                 Reset the last time                 place                  imagePanel.incTime                  forMovingImage object  movingObjects                                      ifobject instanceof Building                                              object.incrementPosition     Augment position by velocity                         ifplace500  0If 5 seconds have passed...

I use Savon 2, Ruby 1.9 and Rails 3.p  precodeltsoapenvEnvelope xmlnsurnurnsafetypaymessagesmwsapi       xmlnssoapenvhttpschemas.xmlsoap.orgsoapenvelope xmlnsurn1urnsafetypayschemamwsapigt    ltsoapenvBodygt      lturnExpressTokenRequestgt         lturn1LanguagegtESlturn1Languagegt         lturnSignaturegt2984764ac8214cca0a44e06badaba4bbc93ed381af59199f65d9clturnSignaturegt      lturnExpressTokenRequestgt    ltsoapenvBodygt ltsoapenvEnvelopegt codepre  pThank you in advance p  pI WANT TO SHARE THE SOLUTIONp  pFinally, I was able to puzzle it out. Notice that the code posted in this forum is not exactly the real one for security andor brevity purposes its incomplete.p  precode Instance of the Savon client using the respective wsdl. Notice the two multiple namespaces.  Also, see the namespace prefix urn making it different to the default one.   In addition,the code changed the envelope namespace prefix to soapenv.  While debugging in console irb, I used the parameters log true, prettyprintxml true inside the following client instance too e.g. ...envnamespace soapenv, log true, prettyprintxml true... . This allowed me to see very easily the XML Savon was sending when requesting.  Remember to require the necessary resources. Maybe require savon, require digest,...  client  Savon.clientwsdl MerchantExpressWs.wsdl, namespaces xmlnsurn gt urnsafetypaymessagesmwsapi,   xmlnsurn1  gturnsafetypayschemamwsapi, namespaceidentifier urn, envnamespace soapenv   Assignment of variables below must be done in this case. I dont write it here to be this code not so large.   A thing I lasted much time to know how to do was to add the prefix urn1 only to the tag Language urn1Language, since the code was adding urn to all due to the namespaceidentifier urn see the client instance above. As you can see, I simply added it to the array message message1.  message1  urn1Language gt language, Signaturegt signature     The respective operation for this request is createexpresstoken.  response  client.callcreateexpresstoken, message message1    This was the way Savon sent the request as needed by the Web Service. Savon added additional namespaces in comparison to the original XML request I wanted to send, but it was not problematic, it was OK e.g., it added some additional stuff to the namespaces soapenv, urn, urn1 codepre  pI hope this post helps many to make easy to consume SOAP Web Services through Savon  Ruby and maybe with Rails.p  pThank God primarily for every good thing p

In my case, I want some kind of copy of my images to be dragged and dropped not the actual image itself so that ImageSwitcher will still contain that image and I may get that same image on the desired position of my screen as wellthat is where ever I drop that image. p  pHere is my xmlp  precode   ltLinearLayout     androidididrl     androidlayoutwidthfillparent     androidlayoutheightfillparent     androidlayoutmargin0px     androidgravitycenterhorizontal     androidorientationvertical gt      ltcom.example.newsd.Transparent         androidididpopupwindowtop         androidlayoutwidth352dp         androidlayoutheightwrapcontent         androidgravityleft         androidorientationvertical         androidpadding20px gt          ltLinearLayout             androidlayoutwidthfillparent             androidlayoutheightfillparent             androidgravitycenterhorizontal             androidorientationhorizontal gt              ltButton                 androidididbutton1                 androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent                 androidlayoutheightwrapcontent                 androidtextApparatus gt              ltButton                 androidididbutton3                 androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent                 androidlayoutheightwrapcontent                 androidtextMaterials gt              ltButton                 androidididbutton2                 androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent                 androidlayoutheightwrapcontent                 androidtextEquations gt         ltLinearLayoutgt          ltLinearLayout             androidididroot             androidlayoutwidthfillparent             androidlayoutheightfillparent             androidgravitycenterhorizontal             androidorientationhorizontal gt              ltGallery                 androidididgallery1                 androidlayoutwidthfillparent                 androidlayoutheightwrapcontent                 androidlayoutcenterHorizontaltrue gt         ltLinearLayoutgt     ltcom.example.newsd.Transparentgt      ltButton         androidididhandletop         androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent         androidlayoutheightwrapcontent         androidtextClick gt ltLinearLayoutgt codepre  pKindly anyone who knows the solution to my problem, help me out Ill be really grateful.

Negative 25863 pI have two different elements, one is a contenteditable DIV as a directive where you can enter some HTML such as img tags and it will render automatically on keypress.p  pSecondly I have a textarea which is bound to an ngmodel and there I also want users to be able type HTML mainly img tags so it renders automatically however, I cant figure out if this is possible, if users type  tag then it saved as is.p  pWhat is the best solution to achieve what I want on the textarea Do I have to make a directie or is there a more simple solution where I can leverage the ngmodel variable that it is bound to.p  pFinal question, are there any security implications I need to be worried about so I handle input safely I.e. I do not want people to put script tags in there, just img tags, links and maybe some formatting HTML. I use santize service for the directive doing sanitizehtmlContent before rendering.p

Negative 25863 pWe have an upload form in GWT we use to upload files. It works fine when uploading files, but if we upload more than two files in a row, and then click the browser back button, a strange thing happens. The page disappears, eventually reloads itself, and then freezes. No buttons are clickable until it has been reloaded. This happens in Chrome 39, but not the other browser Ive tried it in and old version of firefox.p  pWhy would the form panel submit do something like that How can I fix it I cant seem to find a way to remove the form submit from history, or a simple way to upload files without using GWTs FormPanel and FileUpload. I cant just reload the page after every file upload, because refreshes are very slow.p  pHeres the code that creates the relevant parts of the panelsp  precodeFormPanel uploadForm  new FormPanel uploadForm.setEncodingFormPanel.ENCODINGMULTIPART uploadForm.setMethodFormPanel.METHODPOST uploadForm.setActionservletPath  destinationUrl  FileUpload fileInput  new FileUpload uploadForm.addfileInput.asWidget codepre  pWhen the user clicks to upload a selected file, we usep  precodeuploadForm.submit codepre  pThe a hrefhttpscode.google.compgwtupload relnofollowGWTUploadProjecta is not a solution, as it works arguably worse. If you try to click back after uploading on their a hrefhttpgwtupload.alcala.orggupld relnofollowexamples pagea, it shows an extra thumbnail of the previously uploaded imagep
Negative 25863 pI am building a PHP web site with visual studio 2013. For testing purpose I have a directory files in project root which have a few ten thousands files 1000GB and a few thousands directories. My Visual studio 2013 is not responding because Solution explorer is scanning files directory.p  pMy first idea was to exclude files directory from project, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions27627331visualstudio2013excludedirectoryscanningsolutionexplorerbut no idea how to do thata.p  pMy second idea is to move project source away from Apache document root dir where all those files are. But now I need to publish project or file.html, .js always when I made some changes. This is very time consuming. Is there a way to publish automatically on file save or on every save make copy to different folder Project files and Apache document root are both on same machine.p

Negative 25863 pWhen I compile a program with g and get a core dump I can use codegdbcode to read the executable and the core dump to debug the situation the program run into before it crashed. One of the features codegdbcode offers is the codelistcode option, it is possible to list the source code which was compiled using the executable and the core dump. I used codestrings acode with the executable and the core dump and I couldnt find even one codeifcode or codeforcode statements while Im sure the code has plenty of them. So where does the code is coming from I compile the code on one computer and run it on different one, so the source code is not available on the computer where the core dump is generated, and it doesnt seem to be inside the executable or the core dump. Any suggestions I really want to print all the source code from the executable and from the core dump, is it possible I mean without running codegdbcode, Im sure it is possible to write a script which uses gdb and that can list the entire code but Im interested in doing it myself without codegdbcode because I want to understand from where the source code is taken how it is formatted, I want o know as much as possible about it.p

I can see this by doing a QuickView of it in the Finder as Apple recommends, or by opening it in Preview.  Furthermore, the app itself, when I select it in the Finder, shows a blurry icon that is clearly scaled up from the small icon.  And when I use NSApplicationIcon in an NSImageView in a panel, the icon displayed is tiny.  The larger sizes have clearly not been copied over.p  pIve spent all morning reading about .xcassets on the web, watching a YouTube video on how to assemble them, and of course looking at Apples rather unhelpful documentation.  I cant for the life of me figure out what Im doing wrong.  Any ideasp  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pIm now experimenting with trying to get iconutil to make the ICNS, in the hopes of understanding why Xcode cant do it properly.  I copied my AppIcon.appiconset to my Desktop and tried iconutil c icns AppIcon.appiconset.  It said AppIcon.appiconseterror Invalid Iconset..  I changed the name to AppIcon.iconset in case that was an issue, and it changed its error to AppIcon.iconseterror Failed to generate ICNS.  It occurred to me that maybe the images need to have the same name as the name of the .iconset, so I changed them all from starting with mondrian to starting with AppIcon.  Still getting AppIcon.iconseterror Failed to generate ICNS.  Sure would be nice if iconutil printed out more helpful error messages.p  pI also just opened all of the image files in GraphicConverter, added an alpha channel, and saved them back out, thinking that perhaps an alpha channel was required although I have seen no mention of that anywhere  but most apps do have alpha in their icon, so....  Again, no change AppIcon.iconseterror Failed to generate ICNS..  Aargh.p  pstrongUPDATE 2strong It now works.  Im not sure why.  I added the modified images alpha channel added, saved in GraphicConverter instead of from Photoshop Elements that were in my experimental .iconset on my Desktop back into the AppIcon in the .xcassets of my Xcode project, cleaned and built, and it is now all good.  iconutil still refuses to compile it to an ICNS, but Xcode can now do it.  I have no idea why.  Maybe something about the state of my project was corrupted, or maybe alpha was needed, or maybe GraphicConverter saves PNG files in a way that Xcode likes better than Photoshop Elements format.  Mysteries abound.  Anyway, perhaps this record will be helpful to someone else in a similar situation.p

Negative 25863 pId like to make modal dialog boxes into a separate state within Angular UI Router. However, I have a case where the modal box canshould appear on top of all states... and I am not sure if this is possible.p  pSo for example, lets say I have codestorecode and codeadmincode as 2 separate toplevel states. Now imagine that I have a modal dialog that is unrelated, like a contact form just as an example that should go on top of each.p  pIf I model this as codecontactcode, the codestorecode or codeadmincode states are obviously forgotten, so the background behind the modal is blank.p  pThe solution might be to have two child states, like codestorecontactcode and codeadmincontactcode, and this preserves the content behind the modal dialog box... however, this approach does not scale for X number of toplevel states.p  pIn a nutshell, how can I say that codecontactcode is a child of all states, regardless of nesting Is this possible Or do I simply have to not use angular UI router in this casep

The code looks something like thisp  precode        public void dataGridView1CellFormatting        to count how many rows there are in DGview2         foreach DataGridViewRow mappingRow in mappingView.Rows               to access the cells             foreach DataGridViewCell cell in mappingRow.Cells                to see if the cell is not empty                 if cell.Value  null                    to count how many rows there are in DGview1                     foreach DataGridViewRow exDBRow in exDBView.Rows                        simple integer to remember on which index it is                         datacount                         the check to see if the value of DGview2 is the same as DGview1                         if Convert.ToStringmappingRow.Cells[0].Value  Convert.ToStringexDBRow.Cells[0].Value                                                      code to change the background color of DGview1 cell based on the value in DGview2                             exDBView.Rows[datacount1].DefaultCellStyle.BackColor  Color.LightGreen                             Console.WriteLineConvert.ToStringexDBRow.Cells[0].Value                             Console.WriteLineConvert.ToStringmappingRow.Cells[0].Value                                                  if Convert.ToStringmappingRow.Cells[0].Value  Convert.ToStringexDBRow.Cells[0].Value                                                      exDBView.Rows[datacount  1].Cells[0].Style.BackColor  Color.Red                                                                   to reset the datacount if the loop is over                     datacount  0                                             codepre  pTo summarize what Im trying to do with my codep  pBasically I have a foreach loop in a foreach loop. In it I will look up how many rows I have in DGview2 and how many I have in DGview1. The content of DGview2 will be filled first, thats why I have put it as the first thing in the foreach loop. After the content is filled it will call the function  dataGridView1CellFormatting that is looking for how many rows there are in DGview2. p  pAfter counting it, it will also check for which values are null and skip them. Afterwards it will count how many rows there are in DGview1. In this foreach loop it will also increment the int datacount, which I use to remember on what index it currently is. After that I made an if statement to check if the value of DGview1 is the same with DGview2. Since I put it in a foreach loop it will spool all the rows in DGview1. So if the first index does not contain the value of DGview2, it will go to the 2nd, to the 3rd and so forth until it reaches that value. When it reaches that value, it will make the background color of that value light green in DGview1. If the value is not found it will make the rest of the values red. After all of this it will reset the datacount to 0 so that the next time the user calls the function it will start all over again. Also the reason why I put in 1 in the index number is because for some reason it counts the empty row also, resulting in an index error. At the end of the import with my datasource it always add a new empty row in DGview1.p  pThe problem I have with this color is that the first time I run it, all cells except the one I selected are turning red. Just as I want it to be, but the selected cell is still white. After I press the button another time, all cells turns red. It doesnt matter which value I select in DGview1, they always turn red.p  pNow Im in a bit of a pinch since I really dont know what is causing this and how to fix it. Also another question I have is if this is the appropriate way to handle things. Are there any other options to change the background color of DGview1 based on the values of DGview2 p  pPS. I once tried to change the background colors of DGview1 with the selectedcells event. While yes that does work, but the thing is if the user deletes a value in DGview2, I want to update it in DGview1, which is as far as I know not possible with the selectedcells event. Hence why I tried to do it with a foreach loop and checking both the values of DGview1 and DGview2.p  pSincerely thanks beforehand.p

Negative 25863 pI have an array containing 365 objects date and value, and I would like to reduce this into half to make plotting faster. The reduction has to occur such that I get every other point in the array. So if the first element is for Jan 1, the second element would be for Jan 3 instead of Jan 2. I can iterate through the array and if the number is odd I can add that to the new array or vice versa. But is there a betterfaster way to achieve this I heard crossfilter.js is made for things like this, but wasnt able to figure out how to use it for this case. Any suggestionsp

Negative 25863 pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma181178672950621Paul Whipps answera to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10344197howdoesdjangosmetaclassworka question about Djangos Meta classa says that Djangos Meta class is normal python for creating a convenient namespace for shared data among the class instances.  Intuitively, this way of separating class members with different properties using nested class namespaces seems like it would be part of a well defined object oriented programming pattern.  I would think this would be especially true when defining persistent model objects.  I can imagine such a pattern being built into other data modeling libraries or languages.  Is there such a pattern in popular use  p  pIf so, is there a better name than Meta for a namespace used to define the nonpersistent transient class members  The Meta class is easily confused with python metaclasses which are not the same thing.p

Negative 25863 pI was wondering if there are any libraries out there that do what the Compass sprite generator does I absolutely love that feature of Compass, but I dont want the rest of the framework. I just want something that creates a sprite with a folder full of PNGs and maybe creates some CSS classes I can use to display the graphics in the sprite. Ive done a little poking around, and I see a lot of sprite generators as web apps. Do people use these for hightraffic sites Or do people generally maintain their own sprites using Photoshop or some better tool Any info is most appreciatedp

Negative 25863 pIm having to deal with a transaction isolation problem of sorts. There is a legacy frontend invoking two separate web services on the application layer, that update a related record in the downstream MDM solution.p  pBoth exposed web services update some elements of the same record. p  pWhen the update call comes through from the frontend, one service is invoked sync and the other async.p  pIt is difficult to predict the sequence of calls, and we hit a classic stale data issue, when once of the service has queried and running some logic in the application tier, whilst the other has already updated the record.p  pMy scope to make change only to the application tier to handle this.p  pIm thinking to have a pseudo transaction monitor, first request comes, updates a table to hold the record identifier and a mark a dirty flag.p  pThe next request comes, looks for the record identifier in the DB, if flag true,  queues up the request and retries once the flag is turned to false.p  pAlmost like a record version check before it lets any updates.p  pIs this a good approach, any suggestions  comments appreciated.p  pThanks p

Negative 25863 pWith a friend we were a long time trying to work with Git and Android Studio, but we had a problem we are very new to git and Android Studio, we started a couple of days ago on both issues.p  pWhat happens to us is that, for example, if I cloned the git repository and I try to make a merge, then the button to execute is grayed out and it doesnt let me compile or run it, also if I display the project structure as Android or Packages I see nothing, I can only see the files in Project, Project Files, Recent Changes, etc...p  pI will explain in detail everything weve done.p  pFirst, the repository looks like this p and c are just the initials.p  precode  x c   x master     x p codepre  pMaster has the first initial commit with .gitignore and README.md, nothing more, while we me who created the branch p, and my friend who created the branc c have just one commit each one with executable projects, although Im not interested in joining what Ive done with what my friend has done, I just want to start a new project of Android Studio with what my friend has made.p  pSo I start Android Studio, Check out project from Version Control  GitHub, I put my key and choose the repository I want to clone, after that AS ask me if I want to create a new project and I click Yes.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comWuU1k.png altenter image description herep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comEhf3c.png altenter image description herep  pI hit next until the new project is created and here I can see all the branches that we have created on GitHub.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comu1yxT.png altenter image description herep  pAfter that I make a local branch to try to work with the project of my friend, with the option Git branches  New Branch and calling it p, which moves me to this local branch automatically.p  pAfter that, I choose the Merge option of the remote branch originc, and I get a merge failure, that says Some untracked working tree files would be overwritten by merge. Please move or remove them before you can merge., I choose the option to view the files and it shows me these.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comnjVAk.png altenter image description herep  pSince my project is completely new, and the project that my friend uploaded worked fine for him, I just deleted these files with the red bar that my mouse is pointing and after that a message appears that says there is no difference now.p  pFinally, after that, I go again to the merge option of the remote branch c, and a conflict message appears, which is on the .gitignore file, in my case I put to Accept Theirs, and I see the message that the merge was correctly.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comYXyTI.png altenter image description herep  pAnd now it is when I see that the button to execute is grayed and if I display the project structure as Android I see nothing, I can only see the files in Project, Project Files, etc...p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comlKhgd.png altenter image description herep  pI think it should be something super basic what Im asking, but we me and my friend had never worked with git or android studio and now we are asked to make a project using them.p

Heres my codep  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt include ltcstdlibgt  using namespace std  int main      int A  int mallocsizeofint5     int B[5]  0,1,2,3,4     A[0]  0     A[1]  1     A[2]  2     A[3]  3     A[4]  4     A[5]  5     A[12]  12     A[1000]  1000     cout ltlt A[0]   ltlt A[0] ltlt , A[1]   ltlt A[1] ltlt endl     cout ltlt A[2]   ltlt A[2] ltlt , A[3]   ltlt A[3] ltlt endl     cout ltlt A[4]   ltlt A[4] ltlt endl     cout ltlt A[12]   ltlt A[12] ltlt , A[5]    ltlt A[5] ltlt endl     cout ltlt A[1000]   ltlt A[1000] ltlt endl     cout ltlt A5   ltlt A5 ltlt endl     B[5]  5     cout ltlt B[5]   ltlt B[5] ltlt endl     cout ltlt B5   ltlt B5 ltlt endl          return 0  codepre  pNotice that this code is not written in chronological order, but edited over time as I kept experimenting.p  pAnyhow, the code compiles just fine and I get the following outputp  precodeA[0]  0, A[1]  1 A[2]  2, A[3]  3 A[4]  4 A[12]  12, A[5]   5 A[1000]  0 A5  5 B[5]  5 B5  5 codepre  pShouldnt A and B only be able to hold 5 values Or is what Im doing very dangerous What is to stop someone from tampering with A[2000] if it is some sensitive piece of memory Is this an actual problem, and if it is, does C have any precautions for this situationp
Negative 25863 pId like to write some code that uses BITS for copying very large files between disks on the same server the second disk being a SAN level clonesnapshot.p  pI looked into BITS as i thought it would be a good way to get progresspercentage complete data on the transfers, as well as resume functionality etcp  pI have a lot of hosted Powershell and I thought id have a stab at using the inbuilt BITS cmdlets, as this would be a super quick way of doing it, i could write wrappers to get the stuff i need etc Unfortunately i ran into  this p  blockquote   pWhen you use BitsTransfer cmdlets from within a process that runs in a noninteractive context, such as a Windows service, you may not be able to add files to BITS jobs, which can result in a suspended state. For the job to proceed, the identity that was used to create a transfer job must be logged on. For example, when creating a BITS job in a PowerShell script that was executed as a Task Scheduler job, the BITS transfer will never complete unless the Task Schedulers task setting Run only when user is logged on is enabled.p blockquote  pDoing anything through an impersonated Powershell runspace throws up the following errorp  blockquote   pThe operation being requested was not performed because the user has not logged on to the network. The specified service does not exist. Exception from HRESULT 0x800704DDp blockquote  pMy web service is running as AppPoolIdentity, I impersonate when needed to do stuff. It makes sense this doesnt work via hosted Powershell, but can anyone think of a workaround If this isnt possible, do i have any alternatives p  pI was thinking of using BITS Compact Server as an alternative, but the documentation is ancient.p
Negative 25863 pI am using KIF to test my UI. I have a very basic login screen and the button on the screen only becomes enabled after text has been entered into both the email and password field. I want to write a KIF test using code[tester]code to test whether or not that button can be tapped. Is that possiblep
Negative 25863 pI have been developing an eclipse plugin that currently exists as its own icon on the workbench. However, I would like to hook it into the pydev run unit test tool so that the plugin fires when I begin running unit tests. I have found some information regarding the use of p  precodeimport org.python.pydev.pyunit.ITestRunListener codepre  pbut eclipse says the import cannot be resolved. I have tried building clean and ensuring that my plugin dependencies require all pydev related plugins. Has the above mentioned import been deprecated If so does anyone know of an alternative to setting a listener for the unit test run toolp

I do it by copying my upload data to the request stream of codeHttpWebRequestcode bit by bit and update the progress bar according to the number of bytes copied and the total number of bytes.

Negative 25863 pHi I have a intuitive case of message forwarding as you can see below. Actor1 is forwarding multiple messages to Actor2, however Actor2 only receives portions of messages, for some reason some messages get lost without a trace.

Why could this be happeningp  precodeActor1 extends Actor     val actor2  context.actorOfActor2.props    def receive         case msg SomeMessage gt           log.infoForwarding SomeMessage to Actor2          actor2 forward msg              Actor2 extends Actor     def receive         case msg SomeMessage gt            Do something           log.infoSomeMessage received from Actor1             codepre

Negative 25863 pI have a JavaScript dashboard framework that loads HTML widgets as objects document.createElement which once loaded execute startup JavaScript logic in the HTML widget. Previous version of this dashboard was only used in IE 1011 and I could hide the object using the CSS display hidden property until the object was fully loaded and completed its startup code which typically adjusted the way the widget looked on the screen eg. change background color based on the setting saved for the widget. Once complete I could change the CSS display setting to inline to show the widget.p  pNow Im trying to get this to work in Chrome and the new MS Edge browser, and it seems I was previously relying on an IE quirk as both Edge and Chrome wont allow manipulation of the object if its CSS display properties is none when it is first loaded. If the object is visible when loaded this means the end user sees each widget load in a transitory state and morph to its final state while its startup JavaScript is run, which isnt pretty.p  pWhat Id like to do is have the object hidden until its startup is complete. I have tried a combination of relevant CSS properties like setting height to 0, display none and visibility hidden, as well as adjusting zindex so the object sits behind a splash screen appendChild seems to override zindex settings. p  pI could have the object manage its display by itself but Id much rather the dashboard framework handle it instead.p  pAny ideas how I can hide a dynamically loaded HTML object until Im ready to show it once all objects are loaded I can use jQuery in the dashboard but not in the object itself too heavy, although if there is a jQuery answer it can be done in native JavaScript also my preference. And note the solution only supports modern HTML5 browsers.p  pIf the above isnt clear Ill setup a fiddle. Thanksp

Negative 25863 pOne of the great aspects about AngularJS is the ability to work with elements without having to query the DOM to look them up by ID, class name, or attributes.  We shouldnt have to worry about how the DOM is setup.  Well, Im attempting to implement a drag and drop directive for my chess game in an attempt to better my knowledge of AngularJSs directives and how they can communicate between directives.  I have my board all setup and it looks pretty nice, and now Im beginning the function parts.  The first thing I wanted to tackle was the draganddrop aspect.  So Ive researched many implementations, and what I find people doing is creating a UUID GUID and applying elements ID in the link function.  That seems counterintuitive to me, especially with the drastic changes coming down the road with AngularJS 2.0.  So I forced myself to start with two directives.p  precodechessApp.directivedropContainer, [function       var bindings           dragOverCss ,         onDragOver amp,         onDrop amp           return          restrict EA,         scope true,         bindToController bindings,         controller [function               this.dragOverCallback  function e                  e.preventDefault                 if this.onDragOver                     this.onDragOvere                           this.dropCallback  function e                  e.preventDefault                 if this.onDrop                     this.onDrope                      ],         link function scope, element, attrs, ctrl              element.ononDragOver, ctrl.dragOverCallback             element.ononDrop, ctrl.onDrop               ] codepre  pand p  precodechessApp.directivedragContainer, [function       var bindings           onDrag amp          return          restrict EA,         scope true,         controllerAs dragContainerCtrl,         bindToController bindings,         controller [function               if this.onDrag                 this.onDrag  angular.noop         ],         link function scope, element, attrs, ctrl              element.attrdraggable, true             element.ononDragStart, ctrl.onDrag               ] codepre  pI imagined being able to use them like sop  precodeltdiv dropcontainer styleborder solid 1px black height 50pxgtltdivgt ltspan dragcontainer styleborder solid 1px black backgroundcolor redgtDrag Meltspangt codepre  pThen I got to thinking...once I drop in my dropContainer directive, how am I supposed to grab the element and its directivecontroller thats being dragged  The possibility that comes to mind is by using a service somehow.

This will continue to consume memory until there isnt any left.  Once all the memory is gone, the TestController is called and the data parameter is null no exception is thrown.  Passing an empty array or not passing that property at all will allow the binder to work properly.  p  pDebugging the asp.net source indicates that the infinite loop is located in the CollectionModelBinder.BindComplexCollectionFromIndexes method.  The indexNames iterator is a whiletrue and binding the sub item always works, didBind is never set to false, so it never breaks out of foreach.  It selects this method because the value from the client is null.p  pSimply sending an empty array is not sufficient since an attacker could easily use this to launch of DOS attack.p  pstrongQuestionsstrongp  ol liWhere can I report this or get further help  The codeplex site looks dead and this is for MVC 4.li liIs there a way to override the behavior of the model binder to avoid this situation Im looking for a global solutionli ol  pAny help would be appreciated.p
Negative 25863 pIm working on a smart phone application that pulls information from a website and displays it on the phone. When there is a new image on the site a notification is sent to the phone and smart watch. What I want to know, is there a way of setting the notification background image to the new image using the URL. To make the application faster I dont want to go downloading the Image straight to storage on the phone. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanksp
