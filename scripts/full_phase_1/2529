Positive 2529 pI am creating a game and i need to rotate the ship, how can i rotate the ship from the center rather than the top left corner I am using python 2.7 and Pygame 1.9.p  pHere is the code that i already have to rotate the image.p  precodeshipImg  pygame.transform.rotateshipImg,90 codepre  pHowever this rotates the image from the corner.p
Positive 2529 pI am creating a ship game where you can shoot down enemies and upgrade your ship. I have not done everything because i have a problem with the bullets.p  pBefore we get started i would like to point out that i am currently using python 2.7 and pygame 1.9. I am aware that there are later versions of pygame and python but i started writing this before i knew that there were later versions of pygame for python 3.4.p  pI would also like to point out that i am a very basic coder and do not know some of the advanced things yet.p  precodeimport pygame import time  pygame.init  white  255,255,255 black  0,0,0 red  255,0,0 green  0,255,0 blue  0,0,255

Positive 2529 pI have created a fully functioning chess game with pygame in python. The only current onscreen options I have are the reset button to reset the game board and the quit button, to quit the game. I want to create an option for the user to save and load a game at any time they like, so that it will store the piece positions and whose turn it is. Ive tried using the pickle module for this, but I cant seem to grasp how it works, or whether or not it will actually work with pygame.  p

Positive 2529 pIm making a platform game which is mostly based on recreate the very first Super Mario Bros.p  pFor now what I need is to know when the player object stops colliding with a wall object. I know when it does collide, for example when player.rect.bottom  wall.rect.top then Floor state  1. How can I make Floor state  0 which would make he fall if player is no longer colliding.p  pI already tried by using p  precodeif player.rect.bottomleft   wall.rect.topright or player.rect.bottomright  wall.rect.topleft         Floor  1 codepre  pThat makes the player fall if its in the corner. But if the player has an acceleration, it wont pass through this point, Floor will still be Floor  1 and the player wont fall, hell be afloat or flying.

Positive 2529 pI am trying to make a game with Pygame similar to the Oregon Trail Games.  Im pretty new to Python and Pygame so Im not sure how this could be done.  I would like it so that the background is an certain image, for example, the first background could be Image 1.  Image 1 would say Press K to do this or press J to do this instead.  I would like it to go to image 2 if you press K and go to image 3 if you press J.  I would think it would be pretty simple but basically I want it so that the background has to be a certain image to press that key to go to another image.  A code example would be awesome, THANKSp

Positive 2529 pI am trying to make a Sudoku app, in fact just to show off really. I have been able to figure out everything with a little bit of searching until know. You see, my code dont have any rules on where the numbers can be. Therefore the sudoku very often has the same numbers besides each others. I want to make that not happen. I also would like someone to tell how to not have two of the same number in those 3 x 3 grid things.

Negative 2529 pI have a Windows Service which performs a certain function, and then needs to send that information off to a webservice for processing. The webservice is hosted by a remote web application. I am trying to ascertain the best way to call the webservices as each web application might be only 2.0, or 3.5 etc. In my windows service, I am defining each client in the app.config, e.g.p  precodeltClient WebServiceUrlhttplocation.comwebservice.svc Username Passwordgt  ltClientgt codepre  pThe web application must implement two web services that are required for my windows service to run, however not sure the best way to implement the rules for the web application. p  pstrongEDITstrong p  pIll try and rephrase.. The Windows Service runs every 30 seconds and obtains a list of information. The service supports multiple clients as shown above. When each client process is run, the data is collected and is then needed to be sent to the supporting web application. p  pThe windows service does not know what to do with the data, it is just sending it. Each web application for a client would be in different locations, and could possibly be built in 2.0, 3.5, PHP, etc. All the windows service cares about, is that when it performs its processing for a client, it is able to send the data to the webservice location defined in the app.config of the windows service. p  pWhat Im trying to determine is how to connect to the webservice which Im leaning towards WCF, however Basic or WS not sure, and what rules need to be defined for the web application in how to build the response. p  pIf the Windows service is to support php applications etc, WSHttpBinding would not be an option, which would mean BasicHttpBinding would then work. The other thing to decide is whether or not to utilise a RESTful service or SOAP service. p  pHope this makes more sense.p

One all data is retrieved, use LinqtoObject to determine the different Sum and Count values needed based on different conditions.li ol  pI know that I could try each one out to see which is fastest, but I am interested in the communitys advice on which one is likely to be faster. Assume Sql Server and Web Server each running on their own machines, each with sufficient memory. p  pRight now I am leaning towards option 1. Even though there are many more queries to the DB, the DB itself will do all of the aggregation work and very little data will pass in between the Sql Server and the Web Server. With option 2, there is only one query, but it will pass a very large amount of data to .Net, and then .Net will have to do all of the heavy lifting with regards to the aggregate functions and though I dont have anything to base it on, I suspect that Sql Server is more efficient at running these types of big aggregate functions.p  pAny thoughts on which way to go or a third option that I am missingp

Negative 2529 pIm looking for some feedback on my ASP.NET MVC based CMS application architecture.p  pDomain Model  depends on nothing but the System classes to define types. For now, mostly anemic.p  pRepository Layer  abstracted data access, only called by the services layerp  pServices Layer  performs business logic on domain models.

Im finding this is nice because it depends on nothing not even classes in the services layer.  p  pThe services layer is a  bit tricky... I only want the controllers to have access to viewmodels for ease of GUI programming.  However, some of the services need to talk to each other.  For example, I have an eventing service that notifies other listener services when content is tagged, when blog posts are created, etc.  Currently, the methods that take domain models as inputs or return them are marked internal so they cant be used by the controllers.p  pSounds like overkill  Not enough abstraction  Im mainly doing this as a learning exercise in being strict about architecture, not for an actual product, so please no feedback along the lines of right depends on what you want to do.p  pthanksp

All I can work with is the client. And the client connects easily to this RESTweb service and is able to retrieve data.

So, the service is called XMLData, the data is DocumentEntity. Something likep  precodeforeach DocumentEntity Document in XMLData.Documents      DoSomethingDocument  codepre  pFails, since it loads all documents first. It then fails with Object reference not set to an instance of an object. possibly because the server times out or whatever. Doing the same with another tableentity on the same server just works fine.

Negative 2529 pI have been playing around with Apache CXF, in particular the various data bindings it supports JAXB the default, MTOM, Aegis and XMLBeans. Since all of these are supported, I suppose each has its merits. I came up with thesep  ul liObviously, MTOM is to be preferred where large attachments are involved.li liJAXB depends on annotations, so it is less suited when modification of classes is restricted.li liAegis has no codewsdl2javacode tool, so it is less suited for contractfirst development, i.e. start with a WSDL and generate your Java code from that.li liIt emappearsem that Aegis provides slightly more control over the mapping between Java classes and XML through its declarative syntax in emClassem.aegis.xml files. On the other hand, I couldnt devise of any scenarios where JAXB did not do the trick.li ul  pI found this question juxtaposing JAXB and XMLBeans, but it doesnt give a comprehensive overviewp  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1362030jaxbvsapachexmlbeanshttpstackoverflow.comquestions1362030jaxbvsapachexmlbeansap  pBesides these naive, a priori considerations, do you have any bloodandguts experiences that would support the use of any other binding besides JAXB Im asking from a CXF point of view, but if any other options come to mind e.g. Castor please dont hesitate to elaborate.p
Negative 2529 pIve updated my question as I realised that my code was the cause of the original issue.  However in investigating the problem further Ive now come across an exception that occurs in my code during the mapping process, but I am unable to capture in my mapping expression extension.p  pBasically the code below will throw a keynotfoundexception when dictionaryKey contains a value not found in the dictionary.  As far as Automapper is concerned, the dictionary is held in the source object being mapped and the dictionaryKeys requested are from the properties on the target object to be mapped top  precodepublic dynamic GetValuestring dictionaryKey     return dictionary[dictionaryKey].Value  codepre  pThe automapper extension class is shown below in full, Ive added comments to the line that causes the makes the call to the code above, throwing the exception.   The problem is that its not caught by its surrounding code, instead is thrown all the way out to the Mapper.Maplt...... call.   What causes this issue, why is the exception not caught in the try catch block Ive added break points to confirm exception is thrown in GetValue... by code within the trycatch block.p  precodepublic static IMappingExpressionltActiveRecord, TDestinationgt ConvertFromDictionaryltTDestinationgtthis IMappingExpressionltActiveRecord, TDestinationgt exp, Funcltstring, stringgt propertyNameMapper     foreach        PropertyInfo pi in typeof TDestination.GetPropertiesBindingFlags.Instance  BindingFlags.Public  BindingFlags.NonPublic           if pi.CanWrite          continue        string propertyName  pi.Name       propertyName  propertyNameMapperpropertyName        try                  The following code will fail when the target readwrite property does not exist in the            source dictionary.  This is thrown in GetValue as a KeyNotFoundException.  But it is not           caught in this trycatch.  It makes its way all the way up to the calling code           i.e. var entity  Mapper.MapltActiveRecord, EntityDetailgtactiveRecord          exp.ForMemberpropertyName, cfg gt cfg.MapFromr gt r.ActiveFields.GetValuepropertyName              catch Exception ex                  This is never reached by the exception above          throw ex               return exp  codepre  pstrongUPDATEstrong Whilst the key not found exception is thrown in the GetValue call, it is wrapped up in a AutoMapper.AutoMappingException that is bubbled up on the line belowp  pCustomer customer  Mapper.Maprecordp  pOf course, calling Mapper.Map for these objects will trigger my implementation of IMappingExpression to do the mapping as it was set up asp  pMapper.CreateMap.ConvertFromDictionarypropName  propNamep  pAs Automapper is a static wrapper class around the inner workings of automapper is this the reason that the exception is not caught in the implementation of IMappingExpression, but is bubbled up to the code that triggered the map call itselfp

Negative 2529 pI have two Entities, Transaction and Entry. Transaction has some own data and a list of one or several Entries which consists of a debit and a credit amount.

In any case I need to make sure that the EntityManagers cache is still valid, because as it is now it still contains the deleted objects.p  pI have tried with entityManager.flush after these deletes to no success. Since I use executeUpdate the deletes are flushed immediately to the underlaying database so I didnt really expect it to help. p  pAppreciate any and all pointers, hints and answers.p

Negative 2529 pI have a QMainWindow with a QTabWidget. From the QTabWidget, you can get a QTabBar and the set the QTabBars TabButton as per a hrefhttpdoc.qt.nokia.com4.7qtabbar.htmlsetTabButton relnofollowhttpdoc.qt.nokia.com4.7qtabbar.htmlsetTabButtonap  pSo, Id like to do this to put a throbber animated gif next to the text for each tab. This usually worked fine, until sometimes a peculiar behavior occured  namely, the animation would freeze and not update. Then, moving your mouse lets the animation update. Clearly there was as issue wit the event processing  if Qt has an event then the animation worked fine, but if not, it paused.p  pIve finally managed to get a reduced testcase for this problem after a days work, and its listed below.p  pCopy the below code into a file, create an images subfolder underneath it, and throw in a throbber.gif say a hrefhttpupload.wikimedia.orgwikipediaen778Netscapethrobber2.gif relnofollowhttpupload.wikimedia.orgwikipediaen778Netscapethrobber2.gifa .p  pRun the program, and notice how the throbber only animates when you move your mouse over the window. Next, change the line codeEVILNESS10code to codeEVILNESS1code and rerun the program.

Negative 2529 pAt the moment Im trying to set up a repository for multiple products using the same code. The best solution would be to make real libs of the shared code and use them that way. However this takes way to much time at the moment. The idea is to have a single repository with the following treep  precodetrunkProject1       Project2       Shared codepre  pProject 1 and 2 both have a external to include the shared code. The external points to a specific revision to not break project2 build while working on project1 and the shared code. From this a problem arises. p  pWhen a change is made to the shared code and I do a commit with tortoise SVN the changes are picked up for both the project1 and the shared code and are nicely commited to SVN as a single revision. However when I or a colleague does an update the project will not build because the svn external is pointing to the old revision.p  pThis can be fixed by updating the external and committing it leave the build broken in between. We could temporary remove the specific revision from the external, but we have to add it again when development ends. Is there a way to do this automaticallyp

Negative 2529 pHey guys, i know the question doesnt make it clear enough couldnt find how to explain the prob in a single line.

Thus the signals of each component are connected separately.p  pThis is the connections code in the constructor for classAp  precodeQtCore.QObject.connectself.ui.pushButton, QtCore.SIGNALclicked, self.impAln QtCore.QObject.connectself.ui.comboBox2, QtCore.SIGNALcurrentIndexChangedint, self.makeAlnTable QtCore.QObject.connectself.ui.pushButton2, QtCore.SIGNALclicked, self.reset codepre  pThe connections code in the constructor for classBp  precodeQtCore.QObject.connectself.ui.comboBox3, QtCore.SIGNALcurrentIndexChangedint, self.enableLineEdits QtCore.QObject.connectself.ui.comboBox4, QtCore.SIGNALcurrentIndexChangedint, self.enableLineEdits QtCore.QObject.connectself.ui.comboBox5, QtCore.SIGNALcurrentIndexChangedint, self.enableLineEdits QtCore.QObject.connectself.ui.pushButton4, QtCore.SIGNALclicked, self.wrdMaker QtCore.QObject.connectself.ui.pushButton3, QtCore.SIGNALclicked, self.reset codepre  pThe problem is that when an instance of classA is created, the connections and signals work fine. But when an instance of classB is created, the respective signals dont work buttons dont start methods etc no errorexception is raised. I tried looking up online and in Rapid Gui Programming with Python and Qt, but none cater to this specific problem.p  pAny help is greatly appreciated, thanks in advance..p
Negative 2529 pThis is my first attempt at a real C program. It takes a specified directory, extracts the file name without extension and writes them to an SQL database. This data is then read back into an array and passed into the below foreach loop. The loop then uses the data to search IMDB and store the URL for the first result into the DB. It then reads this data back into a variable and uses this to scrape data from the page such as director, cast, plot etc.p  pI have the program working right down to updating the database at the end with the director, cast, plot, etc data. I have drilled down into the program and all variables contain the correct values, just when the form loads the table in a DataGrid it shows all the data I added earlier in the loop, but not the director etc.  p  pFor these reasons I think my SQL statement at the end of the program may be wrong.

Negative 2529 pOn my site there is a page where a user can see a list of all the payments they need to make, select a file, and make that payment.  The problem I am having is if the user makes a payment on a file and then types in the URL of the payment grid page a cached page appears still showing the file that has already been paid, allowing the user to submit a second payment.  What I would like to do is always go through the controller so if the user types in this URL they would regenerate the model and this file would no longer appear.  Is there a way to turn of caching for a certain page  Any ideas on how to work around thisp

Negative 2529 pI am creating a minesweeper game in python 2.7. I have run into several problems when attempting to create the GUI. I have used a library called easyGUI found here a hrefhttpeasygui.sourceforge.net relnofollowhttpeasygui.sourceforge.neta for some of the basic setup windows, but that is not my problem. The issue is with the actual minesweeper window itself. I am unsure as to how to put a flag when rightclick or run my recursive locationreveal function when left clicked on a space. The other issue is how to change the text on the button to signify how many bordering mines there are, and where the flags are each time the user makes a decision.

Negative 2529 pIm new to android, and Im trying my best to create a game. Im trying to create a gameover screen for my game, and I though the best way to do that was to create an activity for a gameover screen. However, Im not sure how to go about doing this.The problem seems to be that I cannot create an intent anywhere other than the activity class. So I cant see when the game should end, and then create a new activity without it being in the activity class. So Im having trouble connecting my game model to my activity class, so that when the player dies, it would trigger a gameover activity. Where in my activity class should I put this informationp

Now, I can statically define which bean to autowire in springcontext.xmlp  precodeltbean idcommunicator classcom.mycomp.service.impl.MyServiceImpl gt codepre  pand everything works fine... But then, how to flip the switch and change over to the Stub method on our QA server It has no connection to that service, so we need to run with stubs enabled. A JNDI property would be best for this.. but I just cant get my head around how to toggle what bean spring autowires at runtime.p  pAny helpp  pCheers, Chrisp
Negative 2529 pIm new to using callback functions and struggling trying to hook some up through jquery that are to be called when certain ui elements are changed.

Negative 2529 pI have a PHP mail form that Ive set up which utilizes AJAX amp jQuery to validate and submit the form.

Negative 2529 pIve built an accordion style control, and am trying to make it as accessible and semantic as I can. Ive got it working fine now, but one aspect of it Im not quite sure about. Feels kind of dirty for some reason. Not really sure if it is dirty or not.p  pDemo a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netMygBf relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netMygBfap  pIn my accordion panels, the entire top bar header is clickable. And, I have some keyword boxes, to the right of each top bar. The way I achieved these keywords boxes, was absolutely positioning them which puts them on top of the link. This had the ill effect of creating dead spaces where you could not click on the bar anymore. To get around this, I just gave the keyword boxes an onclick the same onclick the link has. This all works, but like I said, feels hackydirty.p  pstrongFinally, the questionstrong Is it hackydirty If so, any ideas for another way to achieve the keyword boxes up there, but not create dead spaces in the clickable areap
Negative 2529 pI am trying to use Dependency Injection as much as possible, but I am having trouble when it comes to things like shortlived dependencies.p  pFor example, lets say I have a blog manager object that would like to generate a list of blogs that it found in the database. The options to do this as far as I can tell arep  ol linew Blog li lithisloaderblog ul lithe loader object creates various other types of objects like database objects, text filters, etc.li ulli lithisblogEntryFactorycreateli ol  pHowever, 1 is bad because it creates a strong coupling. 2 still seems bad because it means that the object factory has to be previously injected  exposing all the other objects that it can create.p  pNumber 3 seems okay, but if I use 3, do I put the new keywords in the blogEntryFactory itself, OR, do I inject the loader into the blogEntryFactory and use the loaderp  pIf I have many different factories like blogEntryFactory for example I could have userFactory and commentFactory it would seem like putting the new keyword across all these different factories would be creating dependency problems.p  pI hope this makes sense...p  pstrongNOTEstrongp  pI have had some answers about how this is unnecessary for this specific blog example, but there are, in fact, cases where you should use the Abstract Factory Pattern, and that is the point I am getting at. Do you use new in that case, or do something elsep

Negative 2529 pI have a program written in CC that behaves as a socket server. Id like to write the client in python. The packets exchanged over the TCP socket follow a homemade protocol simple using macros defined as define... in a XXX.h file.

Parsing the XXX.h file manually and matching regular expression feels wrong. So does the idea of running CPP on my .py file.

Negative 2529 pI have a 512x512 image and I tried to recompress it.

Dividing by it by 64 tells me the number of DCT block 8x8 which will be 6144.p  pNow I tried to count the number of 8x8 blocks for pixel domain. 512864 which gives me 64 blocks horizontally and 64 blocks vertically. 64 x 64  4096 which is not equal to number of DCT blocks while the number of pixels are 512x512  262144p  pMy Question is how does Huffman encoding magically transform 393216 coefficients to 262144 pixels and get each pixel values, and compute the dimension 512x512 of the compressed imagejpeg.p  pThanks you in advance.

Negative 2529 pIm working on building a simple 4pane object editor and canvas sizing is a little problematic.  I learned that I should not size the canvas inside CSS and should instead define explicit pixel width and height.  Ive been trying to set everything up so that everything resizes on the fly when the browser is resized, so I basically have a 5x5 table with rows 1,3 and 5 as a height of 5px and columns 1,3 and five with a width of 5px.  The four cells that remain are all equal size.  p  pI placed a div inside each of the found table cells and give the div a background and a border using CSS, along with a padding of 0px.  I dont specify a width or height but Ive tried it with 100 as well.p  pI place a canvas inside each div and dont specify dimensions until everything is laid out.  Afterward, I read the width and height of one of the table cells and set the size of each canvas according to that.  It works fine except that I have a strange 3px gap between the bottom of each canvas and the border of its containing div.  For the table, Ive specified padding 0px  borderspacing 0px and bordercollapsecollapse and for the td cells, have specified padding 0pxp  pThe gap is problem 1.  p  pThe second problem is that because each canvas has its width and height defined, all other components on screen resize automatically with a change in windows size, but the canvas elements remain fixed.  Can I somehow detect a window resize event and regenerate the canvas elements  Ideally, since a resize while theyre visible is kind of slow, I would like to hide or remove the elements when the resize begins and rebuild and show them when resize is complete.   p

Negative 2529 pI have a MySQL DB with 2 tablesp  ul lisamplename stores name of a file, multiple names for same samplehashli lisamplehash stores the hashes of a file, will not store duplicate md5li ul  pall tables have an codeidcode int unsigned NOT NULL autoincrementp  pMy first option to relate these two tables is by creating an md5 column in both tables and relate them. However this seems to have a downside as I will be duplicating a varchar32, which can be a waste of space with millions of records.p  pMy second option is to calculate the file hashes first, grab the mysqlinsertid of the samplehash table and insert into the samplename table. This makes sense if the hash in the samplehash table is new, thus I have the mysqlinsertid variable at my disposal.p  pBut if the hash already exist in the samplesdb, I dont want to store the hash again, so I will have no mysqlinsertid.p  pIs there an alternative other than searching the id of a given md5 in order to store it in the samplesname table in case the md5 already exist If so, how can I do thatp  pThanks in advance RDp
Negative 2529 pI have two separate applications both part of the same system that share a common database.  One application is a gateway that is responsible for communicating with the outside world and the other is a desktop client that local users on the LAN use to readmodifyupdate data in the local database.p  pAt specific intervals, the gateway application will download new data to the local database from various web services.  Likewise, the gateway application will scan for changes to the local database made by users via the desktop client and upload those changes to the appropriate web services.p  pTwo databases are in play, one for production use and one for testdebug use.  The gateway switches between the two by changing the connection string in app.config.p  pWhen testing the gateway application, I would like for it to act in a readonly manner that is, it would be able to download new data to the testdebug database, but it would emnotem be able to upload any changes back to the web service.p  pThe way I accomplish this now is to use the IF DEBUG directive in places where the application would upload data like sop  precodepublic void DetectAndUploadChanges      Uploader Up  new Uploader     Up.DetectChanges      IF DEBUG         Up.UploadChanges     END IF  codepre  pThis method relies on me remembering to use the debug directive everywhere the code can upload some type of change.p  pIs there a betteralternative way to do this type of thingp

Negative 2529 pOk so the issue here that I have a video camera which is connected to a phone via Bluetooth. All communication with the device is via an android Service. The Service periodically updates the camera with GPS coordinates. The service unfortunately is not written by my company and we only have control over starting it and sending it commands however it does the GPS on its own, if connected to a device. Once the service is started by our application we try to connect to any paired devices that contain my companies OUI. Once a device disconnects maybe its turned off or battery runs out, it will not be automatically reconnected until the user relaunches our application. Thus GPS coordinates will not get sent to the camera in that scenario.p  pThis is a problem because the user who doesnt know anything about these services and what not would think if he turned the device back on it should be connected.p  pSo I was thinking I could use AlarmManager with a broadcast receiver or a service probably an intent service because the connection takes several seconds to complete. Perhaps once ever few minutes I could check for a connection to the camera. If its present just quit, and if not attempt to connect if there are paired devices.p  pHowever the problem is what if my application is already running If it is then the user controls connecting to the device they are prompted for it. Do I need to use shared preferences or something like that to tell if my application is runningshut down Is there any way to tell from a service if the application is running I can see this getting tricky. If anyone has ideas how to handle this let me know.p

Negative 2529 pI realize there is much discussion about singletons and why that are bad.  That is not what this question is about.  I understand the drawbacks to singletons.p  pI have a scenario where using a singleton is easy and appears to make sense.  However, I want an alternative that will accomplish what I need without a lot of overhead.p  pOur application is designed as a client that typically runs on laptops in the field and communicates with a back end server.  We have a status bar at the bottom of the main application.  It contains a few text areas that show various statues and information as well as several icons.  The icons change their image to indicate their state.  Such as a GPS icon that indicates if it is connected or not as well as error state.p  pOur main class is called MobileMain.  It owns the status bar area and is responsible for creating it.  We then have a StatusBarManager class.  The StatusBarManager is currently a static class, but could also be a singleton.  Here is the start of the class.p  precodepublic static class StatusBarManager      static ScreenStatusBar StatusBar       ltsummarygt      Creates the status bar that it manages and returns it.      ltsummarygt     public static ScreenStatusBar CreateStatusBar              StatusBar  new ScreenStatusBar         return StatusBar      codepre  pThe MobileMain asks the StatusBarManager for a StatusBar.  It then uses the StatusBar.  No other classes see the StatusBar, just the StatusBarManager.p  pUpdates to the status bar can come from pretty much anywhere in the application.  There are around 20 classes that can update the text areas on the status bar and additional classes that update the icon states.p  pThere will only every be one StatusBar and one StatusBarManager.p  pAny suggestions for a better implementionp  pSome thoughts that I hadp  pMake the StatusBarManager an instance class.  In my MobileMain class hold onto a static public instance of the StatusBarManager class.  Then to do status bar updates you would call MobileMain.StatusBarManager.SetInformationText or some other method of the manager.  The StatusBarManager would not be a singleton, but the MobileMain would only be creating a static instance of it.  The issue here is that MobileMain now has a StatusBar and a StatusBarManager, which just manages the StatusBar it owns.  Still also have a globally avaialble static instance to the StatusBarManager, just a different owner.p  pAnother idea was to use something like an EventEggregator class.  Ive never used one, but have read about them.  I guess the concept is that it would be a globally available class.  In each class that wants to update the status bar it would publish a StatusBarUpdate event.  The StatusBarManager would be the only classes subscribing to the StatusBarUpdate event, and receive all of the notifications.  Ive read though that can end up with leaks with this approach if you are not carefull with unsubscribing from events when cleaning up objects.  Is this approach worth looking intop

Negative 2529 pIm staring to build a system for working with native languages, tags and such data in Yii Framework.p  pI already choose MongoDB for storing my data as I think it feets nicelly and will get better performance with less costs the database will have huge amounts of data. p  pMy question regards user authentication, payments, etc... This are sensitive bits of information and areas where I think the data is relational. p  pSo 1. Would you use two different db systems Should I need them or Im I complicating this 2. If you recommend the two db approach how would I achieve that in Yiip  pThanks for your timep  pPS I do not intend this question to be another endless discussion between the relational vs nonrelational folks.

Negative 2529 pWe are using EF code first with a rather large number of entities. The OnModelCreating method in the DbContext can take 3040 seconds to finish. This is fine for our application, but is very frustrating when trying to iterate on writing tests these are tests which hit the database, not ones where we want to use LINQ to objects. Every time I kick off a singleton test as part of the debugging process, I have to wait for the EF model to be built.p  pDoes anyone have any suggestions for increasing performance here p  pWe are using NUnit with EF 4.3.1, and are running tests with the Resharper NUnit runner in Visual Studio.p
Negative 2529 pOK, Ive searched and saw some questions on how to create a class using its name. My question is not quite the same, so Im going to ask it anyway.p  pMy application has 2 classes, say, A and B. In another class, I need to use these two classes the third class is called by an external service. The external service only passes me the names of the two A and B classes as string. In the third class, I know I can do something likep  precodecase A     create an instance of A case B     create an instance of B codepre  pbut that seems weird. Id like to do it dynamically so I was thinking of doing Activator.CreateInstance but not sure if its good programming because it seems CreateInstance is used when you load an assembly remotely. In my case, everything is in one project.p  pAny advice Thank you so muchp

Negative 2529 pI asked a question here a while back on how to hide my http request calls and make them more secure in my application. I did not want people to use fiddler 2 to see the call and set up a auto responder. Everyone told me to go SSL and calls will be hidden and information kept safe.p  pI bought and installed a SSL Certificate and got everything set up. I booted up fiddler 2 and ran a test application that connect to a https web service as well as connected to a https php script.p  pFiddler 2 was able to not only detect both requests, but decrypt them as well I was able to see all information going back and fourth. Which brings my question.p  pWhat is the point of having SSL if it made 0 security differences. With or without SSL I can see all information going back and fourth and STILL set up a auto responder.p  pIs there something in .net I am missing to better hide my calls going over SSLp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pI am adding a new part to this question as of some of the response I have gotten. What if a app connected to a web service to login. The app sends the web service a username and a password. The web service then sends data back to the app saying good login data or bad. Even if going over SSL the person using fiddler 2 could just set up a auto responder and the application is then cracked. I understand how it could be useful to use need to see the data in debugging, but my question is what exactly should one do make sure the SSL is connecting to is the one it was requesting. Basically saying there can not be a middle man.p

Negative 2529 pIm at a critical decision point in my application design. Its an ASP.NET web application that uses REST to request information about various products. Some products have varying ProductIDs depending on their attributesvariations. For example, a user might be interested in Rogaine. A REST request about Rogain might return a response containing several variations  a 1 month supply, a 3 month supply or a 4 month supply. Each of these variations have a different ProductID, a different regular price, different sale price and a multitude of different attributes. Each one has a different set of features, different images, etc. The amount of attributes for each product can be quite a lot.p  pIn most instances there are only a couple of product variations. Sometimes a half dozen, sometimes a dozen or two. In these instances, JSON can handle my requirements easily.p  pBut take, for example, a dress. It might be available in a couple of dozen colors. Its also available in 6 different sizes. You wouldnt want to display each of these on their own page. Its much more user friendly to display this product on a single page and present these size and color options for the user to select. Perhaps they want to order a small size in a red color.p  pIn the example above, where there are almost 100 combinations of options. At this point, I think JSON becomes an impractical choice for me. For each unique combination, there are several links to images each image displays the product in a different color. Each product has a list price, a regular price and a sale price, amount saved. Each has shipping attributes. Each has its own list of features which can be paragraphs of text for each product.p  pOk, my point is made  this is a lot of data to be stuffing in a JSON string and there will be a delay to lookup details when a color or size is changed.p  pI like the way Amazon presents choices. Here is a link of such a situationp  pa hrefhttprads.stackoverflow.comamznclickB003ILSHQ2 relnofollowhttpwww.amazon.comAmericanApparelJerseyChemiseSmallNavydpB003ILSHQ2ap  pIve looked in the source page and dont see where they are storing each products details on the client side. If you hover each color swatch youll see that all the details change on the page. Price, shipping, large image, features. Virtually everything changes. p  pI see the Loading... indicators once in a while, but in most cases its so fast that you dont see any signs of clientserver communication.p  pHow are they doing this without reloading the page entirely and without storing this information on the client What technology are they using, does anyone know p  pTrust me, a round trip to send another REST request each time a product variation is changed would be way too expensive. And I already have emALLem of the data for every product in my first REST response. The data is not on my server or in my control and I really dont want to save it on my server. p  pSince I already have all of the data, Id like to store it so it can be used like Amazon does, but Id like to hand it off to the client. It would be perfect to use a JSON string and in most cases, I can... but not effectivelyefficiently in all.p  pIs there a way to index a JSON string to make it quicker for large amounts of data Is it just too much for JSON What other options might I have to use with JQueryJavascriptp

Negative 2529 pIve implemented a variant of the very cunning answer a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9233176uniqueidsinknockoutjstemplates9235013herea for generating unique IDs for inputs and corresponding labels in my Knockout markup. My end goal is clickable labels, not unique IDs per se  I had previously been using a click binding on each label which navigated the DOM to select its input, but that seemed breaky and inefficient.p  pHowever the solution linked doesnt work for radio button groups where each radio in the group binds back to the same observable. In my case my radio groups are either true  false binding back to a boolean observable or represent an enum, in which case the observable holds an integer value. The solution as provided results in all of the radios in a group and their corresponding label for attributes getting the same ID.p  pTo make matters more complex, these radio button sets themselves appear multiple times. For example, there might be 10 templated divs each with a set of 3 radio buttons Red, Green, Blue  each radio having a label which I want to activate the corresponding radio on click.p  pIve been struggling to modify this solution to suit, but my brain has now locked up. Any ideas welcomep

Negative 2529 pIm currently using Telerik Open Access which is hateful, but that said is there not an architectural issue around the use of LINQ and ORMs in generalp  pIt occurs to me that what we are doing is moving the burden of data manipulation from the DBMS which is optimised to  perform that task to in my case a webserver which is not.p  pAlso, at least in Teleriks case we are restricting the flexibility of our coding model. In this project I have to extract and create complex data structures that do not map directly into a CRUD interface.  In Telerik Open Access at least, if I use a stored procedure to create the data and it does not map into a known entity I have to return the data as an object array.p  pSo instead I use the entities created by the ORM and manipulate them using LINQ.  The resulting code is ridiculously complex compared to the relatively simple equivalent SQL statement.p  pId be interested in your views specifically around the advocacy of using an ORM and LINQ and whether this is architecturally unsound.p  pIt certainly feels it to me.p  pI havent included code samples because the actual code is irrelevant. That said it might be instructive to know that a 10 line TSQL query 6 of those lines are joins has turned into 300 lines including whitespace of LINQ statements to do the same thing.p

There is no training data before we run the algorithem, although the range and the mean of input and output are known.  I would like to initialize the network with initweights, which initializes the neural networks weights using Widrow  Nguyens algorithm. This function however, takes training data is an argument, from which it deduces the range.  How can I initialize, without the training datap  pOne solution idea is to create fake training data, with the correct range and other parameters if they are used. But I do not know how especially because I use python.p

Negative 2529 pI have a scenario where I have to change the codeOutputPathcode in em.csprojem file after the build.br Id like to know if there is any way to do this in post build events.p
Negative 2529 pIm currently trying to compile a project using ant which uses a number of external libraries specifically apache.hwpf, and JDom2 distributed as .class files.p  pIm currently using eclipse to edit and build the project, but Id like to switch over to using an ant file, as it should be eaiser to maintain dont need a specific version of eclipse, and eaiser to build just run ant build or something.p  pThe problem is, Im not sure where I should be including the libraries in the ant file. My current ant file see below always fails at the javac stage, so I think it should be there. It generally because it cant find things like Element, which is a class defined by the JDom2 library.p  pCould somebody explain where I should be importing it, and how.p  pEDIT As an addendum, the functionality im trying to get is similar to adding a class folder under the libraries tab of build path in project properties in eclipse. This works currently for building my project, but Id like to move away from eclipse if possible.p  pEDIT further clarification what Id do in eclipse by doing ProjectPropertiesJava Build PathLibrariesAdd Class Folder, Id like to be able to do using ant.p  pMy ant script so far isp  precodeltprojectgt     ltproperty namesrc.dir valuesrcgt     ltproperty namelib.dir valuelibgt     ltproperty namebuild.dir valuebuildgt     ltproperty nameclasses.dir valuebuild.dirclassesgt     ltproperty namejar.dir valuebuild.dirjargt     ltproperty namemainclass valuebacc.Maingt      lttarget namecleangt         ltdelete dirbuild.dirgt     lttargetgt      lttarget namecompilegt         ltmkdir dirclasses.dirgt         ltjavac srcdirsrc.dir destdirclasses.dirgt     lttargetgt      lttarget namejargt         ltmkdir dirjar.dirgt         ltjar destfilejar.dirChangeChecker.jar basedirclasses.dirgt             ltmanifestgt                 ltattribute nameMainClass valuemainclassgt             ltmanifestgt         ltjargt     lttargetgt      lttarget namerungt         ltjava jarjar.dirChangeChecker.jar forktruegt     lttargetgt      lttarget namecleanbuild dependsclean,compile,jargt      lttarget namemain dependsclean,rungt ltprojectgt codepre

Negative 2529 pWhat is the best way to have a distributed, notalwaysconnected database across multiple clients and a server environmentp  pI am building a multitenant web app, that also has a detached Windows client.  Entities in the system include contacts, tasks, activities, etc.  A lot of these entities are created at the client end, while it is disconnected from the server. A client may never connect to the server if it operates in standalone mode which is the current version.p  pNow I want to make sure that when an entity is created at the client, it does not create a conflict at the server end.  This appears to be a perfect job for using GUIDs as primary keys, and while it is not a problem at the client end where the number of entities may be small, I am concerned that it will potentially be an issue at the server end where the random nature of the GUIDs will make lookups very inefficient.p  pAdditionally, at what point ie which table do you no longer need to use GUIDs at primary keys  for example say a task has a series of notes 1N  theres nothing specifically special about notes, they just need to be accessible  is there an efficient way of keying these sorts of entitiesp

Negative 2529 pI have an open source WPF application hosted on GitHub a hrefhttpsgithub.comtomhunterghSourceLog relnofollowhttpsgithub.comtomhunterghSourceLogap  pWhat I was hoping to do was add ClickOnce deployment and host the ClickOnce install on AppHarbor so that users are automatically upgraded when I push new commits to GitHub.  What Im looking for is an auto update feature similar to the GitHub Windows client, and Im also hoping to find somewhere to host the ClickOnce install bits for free.p  pI have a number of questionsp  ul liHow does AppHarbor actually work  As far as I can tell it expects a Visual Studio solution containing a single web application project, which it then builds and deploys.  What specifically does it look for to run, what assumptions is it making  What happens when you have non web projects, or your solution isnt in the root directory for example  li liIs there any way to customise the build and deployment process, for example with custom MSBuild scriptsli liHow would I ensure the WPF project is published so that the ClickOnce bits are generatedli liIs there any way to get a build number from the AppHarbor build process  E.g. a four part assembly version 1.2.3.4 and write that to the generated binariesconfigli liIs there any way for AppHarbor to push the ClickOnce bits back to GitHub after a successful build, so that I could instead host the ClickOnce install on GitHubli ul  pShould I be taking a completely different approachp

Negative 2529 pIm reading the strongperlipc perldocstrong and was confused by the section entitled Interactive Client with IOSocket.  It shows a client program that connects with some server and sends a message, receives a response, sends another message, receives a response, ad infinitum.  The author, Tom Christiansen, states that writing the client as a singleprocess program would be much harder, and proceeds to show an implementation that forks a child process dedicated to reading STDIN and sending to the server, while the parent process reads from the server and writes to STDOUT.p  pI understand how this works, but I dont understand why it wouldnt be much emsimplerem rather than harder to write it as a singleprocess programp  precodewhile 1      read from STDIN     write to server     read from server     write to STDOUT  codepre  pMaybe Im missing the point, but it seems to me this is a bad example.  Would you ever really design an clientserver application protocol where the server might suddenly think of something else to say, interjecting characters onto the terminal where the client is in the middle of typing his next queryp  pstrongUPDATE 1strong I understand that the example empermitsem asynchronicity what Im puzzled about is why concurrent IO between a strongCLIstrong client and a server would ever be emdesirableem due to the jumbling of input and output of text on the terminal.  I cant think of any CLI app  clientserver or not  that does that.p  pstrongUPDATE 2strong Oh  Duh... my solution only works if theres emexactly oneem line sent from the server for every line sent by the client.  If the server can send an unknown number of lines in response, Id have to sit in a read from server loop  which would never end, unless my protocol defined some special end of response token.  By handling the sending and receiving in separate processes, you leave it up to the user at the terminal to detect end of response.  p  pI wonder whether its the client, or the server, that typically generates a command prompt  Id always assumed it was the client, but now Im thinking it makes more sense for it to be the server.  p

Ive stored the graphic as an image and I use the .Copy and .Paste methods to get a copy of this image onto the chart.p  pHere is where it gets confusing. I need to rotate the image to get it aligned with the axis using the .rotation property. But when I set the .top and .left properties the shape doesnt end up where I would expect. In fact setting the properties to 0 and 0 doesnt do what I would expect either. Ive tried changing the order of the way I set the properties on the image object but it only appears in a different wrong location.p  pIm sure Im missing some vital aspect of how VBAExcel is placing the object relative to what Im setting the top and left properties to. Basically my goal is to make the image on the left side of the chart with the same width as the plot areas height since the image is rotated I theorize this will make it the same size.p  pThis code does not workp  precodeSheetsImageSheet.Shapesagreement.Copy c.Chart.Paste c.Chart.Shapes1.Rotation270 c.Chart.Shapes1.width  c.Chart.PlotArea.height c.Chart.shapes1.left  5 c.Chart.Shapes1.top  c.Chart.PlotArea.top codepre  pIve also tried this codep  precodec.chart.Shapes1.top  c.chart.PlotArea.top  c.Chart.PlotArea.height codepre  pbecause I thought maybe it was calculating the top as the upperleft corner of the image object when it is not rotated rotating 270 degrees makes this point in a place where it should align with the bottom of the plot area. But that doesnt do what I expected either.p  pThe image is a skinny rectangle that acts as a label for the axis. The chart will end up being laid out like this a hrefhttpimgur.comNrSXR relnofollowhttpimgur.comNrSXRa and the axis label image would be something like this a hrefhttpimgur.com08EWU relnofollowhttpimgur.com08EWUap  pWhat am I missing herep

Negative 2529 pI have a wav file named file.wav, and I want to read some specification of the file with a C program. I found the structure of wav file a hrefhttpsccrma.stanford.educourses422projectsWaveFormat relnofollowherea. According to this document, in a normal wav file, the AudioFormat bytes should be 0x1 and 0x0, or the  NumChannels bytes should be if mono 0x1 and 0x0 there are lots of similar sections that should look like these.p  pNow, my C program is very easy I open the file in binary mode, I seek to the AudioFormat section the 20th byte, I read two bytes and I put them in a buffer then  I print to stdin the buffer content. p  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt  main      void buf[2]     FILE f     ffopenfile.wav, rb      fseekf, 20, SEEKSET      freadbuf, 1, 2, f     printfexample hx hxn, buf[0], buf[1] the  flag stands for the 0x[] format output,  the h says that the number is a short integer 2 bytes.       return 0  codepre  pMy problem is that the second byte instead of being 0x0 is always 0x4e0, and this for every byte which should be 0 for example for NumChannels or BitPerSamples bytes too.

Negative 2529 pI am a complete novice and therefore havent been able to find a solution by looking at past posts. I have a geodatabase ESRI ArcMAP, about 70k records with road kill data that was merged from two databases. p  pEx. p  precodeDate, Route, MilePost, Database  1012012, ML34, 113, AnimalVehicle  1022012, ML34, 113.4, Carcasses  1022012, ML16, 86, Carcasses codepre  pI am trying to sort out duplicate records between the two databases. Records with the same codeMilePostcode, codeRoutecode, and codeDatecode have already been removed. The issue is this codeAnimalVehiclecode can record collisions at any time or day of the week, whereas records from the codeCarcassescode database are only recorded during normal business hours. Therefore, duplication arises from carcasses recorded by codeAnimalVehiclecode after hours on a previous day or during weekends. Records are then duplicated by codeCarcassecodes the following morning, or on a Monday or Tuesday in the event of a holiday weekend. Another issue is that codeAnimalVehicle MilePostscode tend to be rounded to the nearest halfmile, whereas codeCarcasses MilePostscode are more precise. p  pThe goal is to build a query or algorithm that returns records paired between the two codeDatabasecode values, so that when codeDatabaseCarcassescode, the query returns records with codeDatabaseAnimalVehiclecode, where the codeMilePostcode is  0.4 of the codeCarcassescode record, and the codeDatecode is within the last four days of the codeCarcassescode record. It would return the first two rows of the example data. p  pAny response is greatly appreciated Thanksp

Negative 2529 pWe have a shared development repo on a central server, with different branches, call them v4, v5, v6p  pA developer Alice has made a commit to v6 and everything looks good. I have a postreceive hook which has picked up all the relevant details, the continuous integration server can clone the repo and check out this commit and work on it  all is great.p  pHowever, when I checkout v6 in my personal copy and git pull, I dont get the commit Alice made at all. It does not show up in the log or get pulled to my machine at all.p  pWhen I browse the repo via cgit, the commit does not show up in the logs  but I can see the commit if I construct the viewing URL from the SHA and branch.p  pIts like Alice has pushed to an invisible parallel v6 branch in the central bare repo. How do I make this invisible branch reveal itselfp  pSo what could have happened A few hours before Alice did her commit, I deleted the v6 branch on the central repo, using the codegit push origin v6code command. v6 was empty and based on the original master, but I wanted it to derive from the latest v5 work instead. To this end I then checked out v5, did a git pull and then checked this out to v6.  I then pushed this v6 to the shared repo.p  pSo it looks like my delete didnt work, and somehow Alice pushed to v6 but not the v6 that git thinks is v6.  p  pMy fix Modify the refsheadsRelease6 on the bare repo to contain the SHA of Alices commit. p  pBut is that the right thing to do How does git maintain or permit a shadow branch without seriously complaining  Git isnt complaining in my repo or Alices..  p  pANSWERED Looks like the bare repo refsheadsv6 got SNAFUd by my clumsy rebase attempt. After writing the SHA of Alices commit to the bare repo refsheadsv6, everything appears at it should do.p  h1POSTMORTEM analysis.h1  pThe server bare repo was in fact cloned from some original work using bare.  The original repo had v4, v5, v6.p  pThere was a script running at the weekend which did a codegit fetch origin refsheadsrefsheadscodeon the bare repo whcch, I guess, because of the  modifier, handily overwrote the new v6 that we had created with the legacy v6 from the original repo.p  pThis explains why the v6 work seemed to work, then over the weekend disappeared.p  pNo gits fault, quite clearly a mistake of my own making.  Time to sit on the naughty step.p

Negative 2529 pHere is the questionp  pA group of monkeys try to cross a river using an old rope. The rope connects the two sides of river bank and the monkeys can cross the river by climbing the rope handoverhand. The rope is too old, so it can only take at most three monkeys at any time. Otherwise, the rope breaks and the monkeys fall into the water. Additionally, if a rightward monkey encounters a leftward monkey on the rope, they will ght each other and fall into the water. Create a Java class strongMonkeyKingstrong that arranges the group of monkeys to cross the river safely. The implementation of strongMonkeyKingstrong uses Java Monitor strongwaitstrong, strongnotifystrong, and strongnotifyAllstrong to synchronize the monkeys. The class provides the following methodp  precodepublic synchronized ClimbRopeint direction  A monkey calls the method when it arrives at the river bank and wants to  climb the rope in the specified direction 0 or 1 the method blocks the   monkey until it is allowed to climb the rope  public synchronized LeaveRope  After the monkey crossing the river, it will call the method, which  allows other monkeys to climb the rope. codepre  pYou do not need to worry about the implementation of monkeys, but the synchronization should be free from deadlock and no monkey should be prevented from climbing the rope unnecessarilyp  pUnfortunately I dont really have a specific question at the moment, I just really need help on how I should be getting started here, because I really am quite lost. I can see how ClimbRope will need to implement wait and LeaveRope will need to implement notifynotifyAll, but where I really am stuck is figuring out what to do for MonkeyKings run method. Im assuming MonkeyKing will implement Runnable here, any hintstips on what that run method should be doinglook likep  pEDIT Im working on a solution with no run method as I dont think its neededp  precodepublic class MonkeyKing   int MonkeysOnRope0 int currentDirection1  public synchronized void ClimbRopeint direction      try          ifMonkeysOnRope0             currentDirectiondirection                   whileMonkeysOnRopegt3  currentDirection  direction             wait                catch InterruptedException e          e.printStackTrace      finally         MonkeysOnRope        public synchronized void LeaveRope     MonkeysOnRope      notify    codepre  pDoes this look okay so far Im a little worried about two threads hitting that initial try block at the same same time and potentially putting two monkeys on the rope going opposite directions.

Negative 2529 pIve recently launched a linux EC2 instance with Apache  php. My php code eventually watered down to merely calling python from the shell, and nothing more. Its quite an ugly solution, but it works. So, basically my questions arep  ol liJust how badinefficientsilly is it to have a php code that repeatedly calls execpython myscript.py rather than a solution thats more native to python Im assuming its wasteful, but Im trying to understand if I ought fret about it or just keep on chugging. li liI managed to get bottle.py up and running, and was just on the brink of replacing my stupid solution with a continuously running bottle script, that seems more natural. But I failed to integrate this solution with Apache via modwsgi, I think it has to do with python versions incompatibility issue that Im loath to deal with.li liConsidering 2, what are the repercussions of bypassing Apache entirely and simply calling a bottle script with a run command to listen to all incoming communication It seems ugly, but is it inefficient or bad in any way If not, Ill just go ahead and call that my solution... But Im concerned that there might be a reason for people to integrate with Apache. li ol  pAny input would be appreciated. A decent amazon AMI that already runs python 2.7 and processes incoming request by python by default would be nice. Someone saying authoritatively that I shouldnt mess about with this whole apachemodwsgi business and just call bottle as a script would be best p  pstrongEDITstrong I have python 2.7 running bottle with paste as my webserver. Do I have any strongREALstrong reason to prefer apache over this solution and while Im at it, does anyone have experience with enabling ssl in this enviornmentp  pCheers, Urip

[self createGLBuffers]     [self releaseRedundantContent]       Thats it The scene is now constructed and is good to go.       To help you find your scene content once it is loaded, the onOpen method below contains      code to automatically move the camera so that it frames the scene. You can remove that      code once you know where you want to place your camera.       If you encounter problems displaying your models, you can uncomment one or more of the      following lines to help you troubleshoot. You can also use these features on a single node,      or a structure of nodes. See the CC3Node notes for more explanation of these properties.      Also, the onOpen method below contains additional troubleshooting code you can comment      out to move the camera so that it will display the entire scene automatically.       Displays short descriptive text for each node including class, node name amp tag.      The text is displayed centered on the pivot point origin of the node.   self.shouldDrawAllDescriptors  YES       Displays bounding boxes around those nodes with local content eg meshes.   self.shouldDrawAllLocalContentWireframeBoxes  YES       Displays bounding boxes around all nodes.

Negative 2529 pId like keep track of what is essentially type information at compile time for a few functions which currently take arguments of the same type.  Heres an example Say I have two functions codegetThingIndexuint64t tcode and codegetThingAtIndexuint64t tidxcode.  The first function treats the argument as an encoding of the codethingcode, does a nontrivial computation of an index, and returns it.  One can then get the actual thing by calling codegetThingAtIndexcode. codegetThingAtIndexcode, on the other hand, assumes youre querying the structure and already have an index.  The latter of the two methods is faster, but, more importantly, I want to avoid the headaches that might result from passing a codethingcode to codegetThingAtIndexcode or by passing an codeindexcode to codegetThingIndexcode.p  pI was thinking about creating types for codethingcode and thing index sort of like sop  pre classlangcpp prettyprintoverridecodestruct Thing  uint64t thing  struct ThingIndex  uint64t idx  codepre  pAnd then changing the signatures of the functions above to bep  pre classlangcpp prettyprintoverridecodegetThingIndexThing t getThingAtIndexThingIndex idx codepre  pNow, despite the fact that codeThingcode and codeThingIndexcode encode the same underlying type, they are nonetheless distinct at compile time and I  have less opportunity to make stupid mistakes by passing an index to codegetThingIndexcode or a thing to codegetThingAtIndexcode.p  pHowever, Im concerned about the overhead of this approach.  The functions are called many 10s100s of millions of times, and Im curious if the  compiler will optimize away the creation of these structures which essentially do nothing but encode compiletime type information.  If the compiler wont  perform such an optimization, is there a way to create these types of rich types with zero overheadp

I want to resize the div and its gradient background to fit the browser window, but when I change the CSS height property it just cuts the image off instead of resizing it, which means the next section of the page will not transition properly.

Negative 2529 pWe are migrating an old SVN repository to Git. This worked pretty well with a hrefhttpsgithub.comnirvdrumsvn2git relnofollowsvn2gita. Now we want to exclusively work on git but need to mirror any new git commits to the old SVN repository. This is necessary because some production systems still are deployed through SVN.p  pSo I tried to use codegit svncode on the same repository where I ran codesvn2gitcode before. Im not an expert yet but i thought, something like this should do the trickp  precode git svn dcommit interactive Unable to determine upstream SVN information from HEAD history. Perhaps the repository is empty. at usrlibgitcoregitsvn line 780. codepre  pI also tried to get some information about the imported SVN datap  precode git svn info Unable to determine upstream SVN information from working tree history codepre  pSo it seems as if codesvn2gitcode did some magic and left codegit svncode in an unconfigured state. As far as I know git has to keep some references to map the SVN commits to git commits. The opposite command codesvn2git rebasecode works it fetches any new SVN commits and applies them to the git repo. So the data seems to be there and usable by codesvn2gitcode which AFAIK is based on codegit svncode.p  pSo how can I make codegit svncode work Or is there another way how we can backport git commits to SVN from that new repo without starting from scratchp

Negative 2529 pIm trying to create an application bundle for Mac OSX. Im using a 3rd party library Marble, part of KDE, but build for Qtonly that uses its own custom plugins, and Im not sure how to deal with that. Heres what Ive donep  ol liCompile my bundleli liUse macdeployqt to copy Qt libraries to the bundle and tell the binary to use these libraries libraries this appears to copy the Marble library libmarblewidget.dylib to the application bundle, and to fix its library dependencies as wellli liCopy the Marble plugins to bundle.appContentsPlugInsmarble where bundle.app is my bundle, and use installnametool to link them to the Qt and Marble libraries in the bundle.li ol  pHowever, my application wont run. Ive run it with DYLDPRINTLIBRARIES1 to see whats getting loaded, and it all looks good until a plugin from ApplicationsMarble.appContentsMacOSresourcesplugins is loaded rather than from the PlugIns directory in my bundle. At this point, the plugin tries to load the Developer Qt libraries rather than the bundle copies as well as the copy of libmarblewidget.dylib Ive got in usrlocallib and it all falls apart.p  pIts possible that Ive misunderstood the problem, but it seems to me that the issue is that the 3rd party library libmarblewidget.dylib loads the Marble application bundle plugins, which then mess everything up. Assuming Im correct, is there any way to tell this library to use the PlugIns directory inside my application bundle Do I need to recompile itp

Negative 2529 pI have a system that relies on sockets to provide callback capabilities for a gaming system.  For failover and scalability, it is possible for a user to be attached to one socket while another user on the same team is attached to another.p  pWhen a control message comes in, I need to check how many sockets need to respond to the message ie if all team members are on one socket, only one socket needs to push the message to the team members.  Conversely, if team members are load balanced across multiple sockets, the sockets in question need to push the message out to their respectively connected members.p  pCurrently, I am using a polling system that queries custom DB tables which include the socket Id GUID as well as which members are connected to the socket.  This is joined to the message itself, so I am guranteed that each socket processes the message.p  pThe big issue is, I LOATHE POLLINGp  pThe big question is, what technology should I look into in order to accomplish this most efficiently  I looked into SQL Server Dependency, but this looks like it keeps a DB connection open until a query is satisfied.p  pI have also entertained MSMQ, but that seems to only allow one subscriber, which rules out multiple interested sockets.p  pI am not sure about an open source ESB.  I understand the premise of ESBs, but how do I indicate that one socket processed the message, while another has not yet processed the message successfully.p  pThen there is the whole Message Brokering system.  Sounds eerily like a dumbed down ESB to me.p  pI appeal to all you enterprise architects to help me decide this quandry.p  pKind Regardsp

Negative 2529 pIm writing a browser extension that inserts a banner on top of every page that the user visits. The banner must not be sticky and must not block any existing content. a hrefhttpschrome.google.comwebstoredetailawesomefactsbjkhdklfbghoadcamlpmkafgmehcmima relnofollowmy chrome extensionap  pCurrently Im doing this by adding the banner content to the DOM through the following javascript in a contentscript that is inserted on every pagep  precodecontent  ltdiv idlbbannergtblah blahltdivgt htmlfirst.addClasslbbanneradded.prependcontent codepre  pIm adding the content before body so that the banner is not affected by how the site is styled. Then, in order to push the main content of the page down while not affecting any potential site layout, Im using the following stylesp  precodehtml.lbbanneradded     position relative    margintop 32px  lbbanner     height 32px    width 100    position absolute    top 32px    display none    ... other styles...  .lbbanneradded lbbanner  display block  codepre  pThis pushes the whole html down while the banner is absolutely positioned to fill in the empty space in this case 32px.p  pI have tried other methods to add the banner on top of every page. However this method is compatible with the most sites so far even many of those with sticky headers.p  pHowever this is definitely not the best solution as I cannot get it working on facebook, twitter, linkedin works but is blocking some content, gmailgcalendargdoc works but caused some contents to be moved outside of the window, and many more. Furthermore, this method requires me to specify the height of the content, which is okay for now but I would prefer a more dynamic method.p  hr  pstrongNotesstrongp  pWithout the styling I showed above, the banner would still appear on top of every page. However doing so will also break layout on many sites such as google.com. For example on Google, the banner will just cover the black nav bar and there will be extra spacing right before the search results.p  pHeres the chrome extension that is in question a hrefhttpschrome.google.comwebstoredetailawesomefactsbjkhdklfbghoadcamlpmkafgmehcmima relnofollowhttpschrome.google.comwebstoredetailawesomefactsbjkhdklfbghoadcamlpmkafgmehcmimaap

Negative 2529 pI have this propertyeditor for my class Categoria and im trying to autowired it  to the service, the problem its that the services keep getting a null value.

Negative 2529 pIm sort of new at this and Im writing a small application to read data from a voltmeter. Its a RadioShack Digital Multimeter 46range.

Negative 2529 pThis question isnt emhowem to concat amp minify js code  its when, and to what should it be done to. Perhaps a result of the JS invasion into server from clientp  pFrom what I understand, strongconcatenatingstrong code is a technique that arose as a means to strongreduce number of script requestsstrong. As such, this task should be run on JS that will be requested and run in the client  concatenating my files running on Node wont be of any use.p  pOn the other hand, strongminifyingstrong arose as a technique to reduce the total size of a script without impacting functionality, thus strongreducing the number of bits transferred in a requeststrong. Again, this technique seems best applied to code that intends to be transferred to the client. p  pDo I get any performance gain from performing these tasks on my JS running on my serverp

Negative 2529 pThe standard diff tool is very useful to find lines in a file that differ, but it doesnt work well for characterbycharacter differences. I often need a characterbycharacter tool to merge texts i.e. written text, not code modified without synchronization on different computers yes, I know I shouldnt, but it happens anyway. Apart from adding a paragraph or two, I might have altered a comma, a spelling mistake or some other small change in the text that was previously common to both files.p  pDiff will tell me what lines are changed, but since there might be multiple diffs per line, I must carefully scan the lines to find each physically small but important diff per line. After fixing, I must repeat the diff to make sure I didnt miss any edits. It gets even worse when the lines are paragraph formatted i.e. one line per paragraph, and when many consecutive lines have such small differences.p  pRight now I must admit that I usually just load both files into Microsoft Word and use its builtin diff function. It is of course inconvenient to start a huge package like Word just to find some small differences, but at least it compares files on a characterbycharacter basis.p  pWhat I really want is a Unix way of doing this. A small and cute tool or script that does characterbycharacter comparisons on text, i.e. emnotem line based, able to ignore lineendings, reporting by some sensible asciiart, and fully pipeable for use in scripts from the command linep  pThere is another question for this, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1721738usingdifforanythingelsetogetcharacterleveldiffbetweentextfilesUsing 39diff39 or anything else to get characterlevel diff between text filesa, but that question was satisfied by a lib exemplified by a webbased tool, I would prefer a commandline tool.p

Negative 2529 pI managed to make a Search bar through a TEdit that seeks whatever i type from inside a ListView that gets its information from a DataBase and goes through a filter and updates the ListViews items on the fly after a key is pressed. p  pNow i am trying to learn how to implement a way of limiting the results i get in my ListView temporarily until i press a Show More button or something like that in order to get some more relevant results.p  pSince the Database might return over 500 results by the time i press A and that would be harsh to a mobile phones capabilities so i need that feature to make my Search button more efficient.p  pCould someone give me some pointers on what i can use in order to make something like thatp  pEDIT.p  pThe current code i am using for searching in the ListView is this...p  precode   procedure TContactsForm.Edit1ChangeTrackingSender TObject var    Lower string    i integer begin    Lower LowerCaseEdit1.Text.Trim    if Lower  then    begin      if Filtered then        begin        ListView1.Items.Filter  nil        ListView1.ItemIndex  BindSourceDB1.ComponentIndex        end      end      else      begin        ListView1.ItemIndex  1        ListView1.Items.Filter         functionX string Boolean        begin          Result Lower  EmptyStr or LowerCaseX.ContainsLower        end     end    end   function TContactsForm.Filtered Boolean  begin    Result  AssignedListView1.Items.Filter  end codepre

Negative 2529 pIm learning Java and am trying to wrap my head around these data structures. Im coming from PythonPHP so Im used to dynamically sizing arrays on the fly and being able to store multiple data types in one array.p  pHow would I best store this data Say I dont know how many rows Ill have, but I do know that each row will hold 2 columns of data. One column being a string, and the other column being a double. p  pExample in pseudoish code if I had 3 rowsp  precodearrayarraydescription1, 10.00,       arraydescription2, 12.00,       arraydescription3, 14.00 codepre  pThen, I want to loop through the array to process the datawith something likep  precodeforeachrows as row     myStringVal  row[0] on first iteration would be description1     myIntVal  row[1]    on first iteration would be 10.00     ... do something with the values ...  codepre  pIm thinking I need to create an arraylist that holds an array, but I cant store both strings and doubles in a java array, so what do i do Do I use a map instead, and treat it as if it were an array For example, do I create a map where the first element is a numeric ID for each row, the second element is the string value, the 3rd element is the double value, and then I use a loop to increase a counter and grab each row from the map that using the numeric IDp  pReally confused as to how this will work.

Negative 2529 pRight now I am trying to learn the assembly language on x86 systems. Therefore I am readying the book Programming from the Ground Up. Available for free at a hrefhttpdownload.savannah.gnu.orgreleasespgubook relnofollowhttpdownload.savannah.gnu.orgreleasespgubookap  pOn page 53, the way the computers stack works is explainedp  blockquote   pThe computers stack lives at the very top   addresses of memory. You can push values onto the top of the stack through an   instruction called pushl. [...] Well, we say its the top, but the top of the stack is actually the bottom of the stacks memory. [...]  In memory the stack starts at the top of   memory and grows downward due to architectural considerations. Therefore,   when we refer to the top of the stack remember its at the bottom of the stacks   memory.p blockquote  pThat part I get. Lets say the stacks memory starts at address 0 and ends at address 11 inclusively. That means there are currently three words 4 bytes a piece on the stack. According to my understanding, the word that is on top of the stack currently occupies the addresses 8, 9, 10, and 11. Since one word has 4 bytes and therefore occupies four storage locations in main memory. However, the book now says the followingp  blockquote   pThe stack register, esp, always contains a pointer to the current top of the stack.p blockquote  pOkay, in my example the esp register would hold the address 8. It points to the word that is currently on top of the stack. But...p  blockquote   pEvery time we push something onto the stack with pushl, esp gets subtracted by 4 so that it points to the new top of the stack remember, each word is four bytes long, and the stack grows downward.p blockquote  pWhat Isnt it exactly the other way around If I push another 4bytesized machine word onto the stack, this word will occupy the main memory addresses 12 to 15. Like they said The stack grows downward. Now the esp register points to the word that is currently on top of the stack. It starts at address 12. Before we pushed another word onto the stack, the address that was stored in esp was 8. So esp has clearly been added 4, not subtracted. Where do they get the subtraction from What did I miss I am very confused...p  pHelp is very appreciated p

Negative 2529 pI wonder why the Iterator.next throws a NoSuchElementException. Usually if you use an iterator you will do something likep  precodeforMyClass o myFancyObject      o.doSomething  codepre  pwhich will be compiled asp  precodeIterator it  myFancyObject.iterator whileit.hasNext      MyClass o  MyClassiterator.next     o.doSomething  codepre  pBut why is the next method  to throw a NoSuchElementExceptionp  pSo let us call the hasNext method in the next method like belowp  precodepublic MyClass next      if  hasNext         throw new NoSuchElementException     return mySecretDataModel.getElementcounter  codepre  pBut then I detect following problem The hasNext method will be called twice in each iteration. First it is called from the method which uses the iterator and then a second time by the next method. This costs unnecessary computing time. Is this intention or just a design oversight by the authors of the Iterator interfacep

Negative 2529 pIm setting up an codeNSFetchedResultsControllercode. My entity has an attribute that is called hasRight bool and another attribute called sortOrder int. If hasRight of an entry is true, there is also a sortOrder, which is an integer, available. If on the other hand hasRight is false, the sortOrder is always 0 zero. Currently my code looks like thisp  precode NSFetchedResultsController setupFetchedResultsControllerJournalCategory journalCategory      NSManagedObjectContext managedObjectContext  [[ConfigurationManager sharedInstance] mainManagedObjectContext]      NSFetchRequest fetch  [[NSFetchRequest alloc] init]     [fetch setEntity[NSEntityDescription entityForNameJournal inManagedObjectContextmanagedObjectContext]]      NSSortDescriptor sortDescriptorHasRight  [[NSSortDescriptor alloc] initWithKeyhasRight ascendingNO]     NSSortDescriptor sortDescriptorSortOrder  [[NSSortDescriptor alloc] initWithKeysortOrder ascendingYES]     [fetch setSortDescriptors[NSArray sortDescriptorHasRight, sortDescriptorSortOrder, nil]]      predicate  [NSPredicate predicateWithFormatjournalCategory  , journalCategory]     [fetch setPredicatepredicate]      return [[NSFetchedResultsController alloc] initWithFetchRequestfetch managedObjectContextmanagedObjectContext sectionNameKeyPathnil cacheNamenil]  codepre  pThis code sorts my entries according to hasRight, therefore entries with that flag set to true are displayed before entries with hasRight set to false. Afterwards, the entries are sorted according to the attribute sortOrder. This works fine for all entries with hasRight set to true, because each entry has a unique sortOrder.p  pThe problem is that all entries with hasRight set to false have a sortOrder of 0. Im displaying the data of this Fetch in a codeUICollectionViewcode. What happens is that each time the data in the codeUICollectionViewcode is reloaded, the codeUICollectionViewcode fetches above codeNSFetchedResultsControllercode again and all entries with hasRight false are ordered randomly because all entries have the same value 0 for sortOrder. Therefore each time thecodeUICollectionViewcode is reloaded, all cells with hasRight set to false rearrange in a random order.p  pWhat Id like to do is to apply the second codeNSSortDescriptor sortDescriptorSortOrdercode only to all entries that have hasRight set to true. Is that even possible with an codeNSFetchedResultsControllercode and if yes, can anyone tell me howp

Negative 2529 pI have made a function that instantiate the class, and do some operations. After that the function is returned, this means the scope is over.

Race against TIMEnnnnSpecial Note from the Architect nnI wanted to push the limits of human ability and find out how quickly people can answer 10 or 100 basic math problems if all barriers to that task are removed. Entering 91 on a number pad and pressing enter can take 2 seconds for many people. Writing the number 55 in pencil can take as long as 4 seconds for slower writers because of the strokes involved. Listening to a verbal question and verbalizing the answer 27 can take as long 4 seconds as well because of the four syllables.nnWhen you add up these 2 to 4 second UserInterface delays over 100 problems, they can add 200 to 400 seconds to the total time required. It becomes quickly apparent that Math Tests do not test math calculation, memory or thinking abilities as much as they test handwriting, verbalization or keypad entry skills. We have shown that it is possible for a really fast thinker to answer 1 math problem every .9 seconds using Math Racer.  In fact, Math u00ae is the only app in the app store that measures and records for viewing on the high score board detail view exactly how long it took the user to answer each question in hundredths of a second.nnThe purpose of this game is to even the playing field and test pure math calculation or memory skills alone. Nothing else ever invented for testing math speed even comes close. We think youll agree. Please let us know your thoughts. We welcome any and all feedback that will help us make Math Racer even faster. nnThe world record in answering 100 Random Math Problems will likely be set on an iPhone 4 using Math u00ae in the next 12 months... Maybe YOU will set itnnThank You. nnMichaelnn,developeri4software,category[Games, Education, Educational]      ]     codepre

I know its 2014 and IE6 should be forgotten about, but without too much effort my site still works with IE6, apart from this one little problem.p  pI had thought about simply using conditional comments to sayp  precodelt[if lte IE6]gt  ltimg srcfoo.jpggt lt[endif]gt lt[if IE]gt  ltimg srcfoo.pnggt lt[endif]gt codepre  pHowever Im not sure what the deal is with other browsers and the use of codelt[if IE]gtcode Also with IE10 not supporting conditional comments, would this cause problems Appreciate any clarification on this. Thanks.p  pstrongUPDATEstrong After trying a few methods, I decided in the end to cheat a little. I got rid of conditional comments entirely and took a screenshot of what the image looked like in firefox with transparency and basically saved that as a jpg. Due to image involved and where it was in the layout, this worked perfectly. Thanks to everyones answers.p

Negative 2529 pWe can use Polymorphism inheritance  virtual functions in order to generalize different types under a common basetype, and then refer to different objects as if they were of the same type.p  pUsing codedynamiccastcode appears to be the exact opposite approach, as in essence we are checking the specific type of an object before deciding what action we want to take.p  pIs there any known example for something that cannot be implemented with conventional polymorphism as easily as it is implemented with codedynamiccastcodep
Negative 2529 pSometimes I have two options for solving a problem  I can do it recursively or iteratively. I know that recursive can often be faster for smaller operations, whilst iteration starts to get faster as the number of times your have to repeat an operation increases. . To test this, I used the code found a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions198409howdoyoutestrunningtimeofvbacodeherea to create a timer class, codecTimercode, and recorded how long it took to complete reversing a string with two different functions  one which was iterative, the other recursive basically I wanted to find out at what point I should switch from using an iterative to a recursive function if I know, for instance, that I could choose between iteratively or recursively reversing a string codestrcode, and that codeLenstrcode is likely to be codegt40code.p  precodeSub TimeReverse  Dim strA As String, tStamp As cTimer, i As Long  strA    For i  1 To 1000     strA  strA  RandomChar      Sheets1.Rangea1.Offseti, 0.Value  i      Set tStamp  New cTimer      Call tStamp.StartCounter     Call InvertStringstrA     Sheets1.Rangeb1.Offseti, 0.Value  CStrtStamp.TimeElapsed      Set tStamp  Nothing      Set tStamp  New cTimer      Call tStamp.StartCounter     Call ReverseStringstrA     Sheets1.RangeC1.Offseti, 0.Value  CStrtStamp.TimeElapsed      Set tStamp  Nothing      Sheets1.Rangee1.Offseti, 0.Value  SUMC amp i  1 amp C2 Next i  End Sub   Public Function InvertStringstr As String As String  Dim str1, str2, str3, midChar As String, i, x, z As Long  If Lenstr Mod 2  0 Then     str3        x  1     For i  1 To Lenstr  2         str1  Midstr, i, 1         str2  Midstr, Lenstr  i  1, 1         str3  Midstr3, 1, x amp str2 amp str1 amp Midstr3, Lenstr3  x  1, x         x  x  1     Next i      InvertString  str3 Else      z  IntLenstr  2  1     midChar  Midstr, z, 1     str3        x  1     For i  1 To Lenstr  2         str1  Midstr, i, 1         str2  Midstr, Lenstr  i  1, 1         str3  Midstr3, 1, x amp str2 amp str1 amp Midstr3, Lenstr3  x  1, x         x  x  1     Next i      InvertString  Midstr3, 1, z amp midChar amp Midstr3, z  1, z End If  End Function   Public Function ReverseStringByVal str As String As String Recursively reverse a string      If Lenstr lt 1 Then         ReverseString  str     Else         ReverseString  ReverseStringMidstr, 2, Lenstr  Midstr, 1, 1     End If  End Function  Private Function RandomChar As String  Dim b As Integer, t As Integer  b  32 t  126  RandomChar  ChrIntt  1  b  Rnd  b  End Function codepre  pI understand that these functions may not be the fastest way to complete the task  and, of course, there is a built in reverse string operator in VBA which I chose not to use because I wanted to understand the structure of the functions I was comparingp  pI converted the output into a chartp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comLz47l.jpg altChart comparing iteration and recursionp  pWhat I want to ask is what explains the sharp spikes for some function calls It looks like sometimes the spikes seem to occur in both the recursive and iterative procedures for the same string, but on the left hand side at least the spike is usually noticeably smaller in the iterative line although I must admit I havent checked to see if the proportional difference from base is the same for both lines. But sometimes they are not aligned at all. Is it that some characters are harder to process, or that some background activity is delaying the function which would explains shared peaks I guess, and, if it is background activity, how come the spikes are not pretty much always aligned For instance, towards the right handside of the chart, there are some pretty massive spikes in the iterative process that dont seem to be shared by the recursive to nearly the same extent. Is it because these functions are now running for so long that background activity has a greater variation in effect upon the two functions in that test loop What Im particularly interested in is whether its something to do with the way I have written these functions How can I work out from this sort of data how I can smooth out and improve the operation of my functions Or do I need to rethink howthe purpose for which I gather my datap

Explain why we used prefix and not   postfix. What changes would have to be made to use the postfix   versions Rewrite the program using the postfix operators.p blockquote  pThere is no special reason to prefer the prefix over the postfix operators in this case. The evaluation order doesnt matter. The manipulation of objects with codesimplecode type like codevectorltintgtsizetypecode shouldnt benefit from the usage of prefix over postfix in practice, so its just a known convention to prefer prefix over postfix, in case the performance matters.p  pTo give you the full context, here the section from the bookp  blockquote   pstrong4.10 Comma Operatorstrongbr   The strongcomma operatorstrong takes two operands, which it evaluates from left to right. Like the logical emANDem and   logical emORem and the conditional operator, the comma operator   guarantees the order in which its operands are evaluated.p      pThe lefthand expression is evaluated and its result is discareded.   The result of a comma expressions is the value of its righthand   expression. The result is an lvalue if the righthand operand is an   lvalue. One common use for the comma operator is in a for loop  p  precodevectorltintgtsizetype cnt  ivec.size    assign values from size...1 to the elements in ivec   forvectorltintgtsizetype ix  0 ix  ivec.size ix, cnt       ivec[ix]  cnt   codepre      pThis loop increments emixem and decrements emcntem in the expression in   the for header.

Negative 2529 pFirst question on SO, hopefully it isnt too far out of left field.p  pstrongMotivationstrong Im working on a fork of Benoits a hrefhttpsgithub.combenoitfragitgoogle2ubuntu relnofollowgoogle2ubuntua voicecontrol tool.p  pCurrently for it to work the user has to press a hotkey to call the program before starting to speak commands. Ive implemented a hotword mode where a daemon bash script, really continuously runs in the background listening for sound above a preset threshold, records for 2 seconds and then sends the recording off to Googles speechtotext API for conversion. It gets the returned result and then checks for the hotword, upon which it launches the actual program.p  pemIm looking for hotwords that are reliably recognized by the Google API.em The API returns a text representation of what it thinks you said, along with a confidence level indicating how well its guess and your recording match up.p  pUsing this we can compare the rates of detection for different hotwords for instance the phrase okay Google is not surprisingly very wellrecognized, regularly returning results likep  pcodehypotheses utterance Okay Google, confidence 0.95967352codep  pThe more generic okay computer is not as recognized as reliably, but still does alright at an average confidence level of 0.85. Some more obscure phrases Ive tested include okay Jarvis if were going to make a voicecontrolled computer... which is unfortunately hitandmiss with high confidence levels half the time and complete misses otherwise. Okay Linux on the other hand is not recognized at all.p  blockquote   pstrongQuestionstrong Does anyone know what sort of phrases are reliably recognized by the Google APIp blockquote  pExamples of good hotwords are short phrases that would not commonly appear in daily speech otherwise wed set off the program every time we had a conversation, but yet are special enough to be recognizable even by dumb computers.p

I have never worked with macros and I have absolutely no idea of how they are implemented....p  pBut please tell me if it is a fact that it is impossible to update an already opened text documentp  pI am thankful for any suggestions or tutorials that you guys may provide    p

Negative 2529 pWe have a customer who is reported receiving an error message along the lines of StartIndex cannot be less than zero. Parameter name startIndex. This is a standard error message usually thrown in the codeSubstringcode and codeRemovecode functions of the codeStringcode class. Unfortunately, I am unable to get ahold of the data that this is failing on for them, so Im forced to debug this by looking at the source code. p  pI have looked for all incidences of codeSubstringcode and codeRemovecode and verified that their StartIndex parameter could not be less than 0. I searched for all uses of startIndex and verified that, in the two cases where they were being used as the first parameter of a string function, it could not mathematically be less than 0 in both cases, it was given the return value of an codeIndexOfcode function, but then a string codeLengthcode and the value of 2 were added to it, so 1 is the smallest value it could have.p  pThis suggests to me that either this is an issue which was fixed in prior codebases, they have a nonstandard codebase, or Im looking in the wrong place. Are there any other functions in C that raise this sort of error text Or is there any way in which it could be reporting the wrong input parameter Am I just misunderstanding this error messagep

Negative 2529 pI am following the Spring tutorial located  a hrefhttpdocs.spring.iodocsSpringMVCstepbysteppart1.html relnofollowherea link is to chapter 1, but Im currently on chapter 2, part 2.2.

The Spring Framework link there seems to require you to download it from GitHub, which I did, but there doesnt seem to be any jar files in this download.

I am very new to command line programming in Windows. Also happy to see if such a script is available for an Ubuntu environment, or a python script, or anything really that would automate this tedious task of changing one part of one line close to 1000 times, as switching the changed directory back to the Windows computer is no big deal at all.

Negative 2529 pI have implemented a Rails project which has a lot of forms, but they do not look good. The codenewcode, codeeditcode, and codedestroycode buttons are very close to each other. Listing the items in each form is also ugly as the columns are very close they definitely need CSS and styling. Is there any sample or template that I can usep

Negative 2529 pThe application Im writing has several different pages that I switch between with a codeQStackedWidgetcode. I want to have a toolbar that is shown only when a certain page is active.p  pMy initial plan was to simply call codeaddToolbarcode from that page, but it appears that emonlyem a codeQMainWindowcode has the codeaddToolbarcode method. So instead, I create the toolbar as a member of the page. My codeQMainWindowcode holds the codeQStackedWidgetcode and calls codeaddToolbarself.page.toolbarcode when I switch to that page and coderemoveToolbarself.page.toolbarcode when I switch away from it.p  pIn the documentation for coderemoveToolbarcode it says Removes the toolbar from the main window layout and hides it. Note that the toolbar is not deleted.p  pBut it certainly seems as if the toolbar is being deleted. When I start the program, the toolbar is hidden as I want it to be. When I switch to the page, codeaddToolbarcode is called and the toolbar is displayed. When I leave the page, coderemoveToolbarcode is called and it is hidden again. So far so good.p  pThe problem is that any following time that I go to the page, the toolbar is never shown again, even though codeaddToolbarcode is being called each time.p  pAm I adding a toolbar that has been hidden How can I unhide itp  pOr, alternatively, is it possible to tie a codeQToolBarcode to an arbitrary widget instead of only a codeQMainWindowcodep

Negative 2529 pI am trying to implement a multiselect row in a table. The parent controller is just an object controller. It has a model, and the view iterates over the recordset of the model as individual rows.   I have implemented an itemController for all the rows in the model. That works.

Negative 2529 pI have a codeUITableViewCellcode subclass that has a large thumbnail thumbnail in each cell along with a title. The cell may be showing a video, an image, a gallery of photos, or a drawing.p  pDepending on which of these content types the cell is displaying, the thumbnail will have a small icon on top to make it clear what kind of content is being shown in the cell.

A drawing may have a pencil.p  pI want to do this in a way that is organized and follows MVC, because Im trying to learn to keep my code organized and maintainable. p  pMy first thought was to have a codeUITableViewCellcode subclass for every content type, but that seems like a lot of different classes to maintain when the only thing that changes is a small icon on top.p  pMy next thought was to have a codetypecode instance variable on the class denoting what it is showing, and then show the icon corresponding to the type.

An object factory queues a request and on codeUpdatecode the objects I requested are instantiated on the correct thread.

Negative 2529 pI have a .net webform NewShift.ascx file. It provides you an interface to add information about a new shift youll be working or just worked.

Negative 2529 pI am trying to add some simple smart card reader functionality to one of our applications and I keep getting a build error that I cant figure out, so Im looking for input or any advice I can find that will help me get the project to compile after importing javax.smartcardio in one of the new classes.p  pI initially created a simple class with one string parsing method and a main method. As a standalone project, I can run the class just fine without errors and all of the expected info from the card reader and card gets printed to the console via System.out as expected, so I dont think theres any issues with the code that I have brought over to my project from this early test project.p  pBut now that Ive imported smartcardio into the new class, my project wont compile. I have tried removing and readding the JRE System library as suggested in several other posts here, but I think this might be a different issue. When compiling, it seems like the compiler isnt recognizing or cant find rt.jar even though I have checked repeatedly and the jar is there in the JRE folder.p  pHeres the error, any help is highly appreciated.

The placing works fine but Id like the shapes that I place to always point straight out, getting the angle of the object to align with whatever route the path takes. Think of this as placing text along a svg path, getting each character to bend with the path, facing outwards or inwards.p  pAny help would be great.p

Negative 2529 ppeople. I have a question. Sometimes accidentally a window appears above some method with its implementation. So I want to understand is there a shortcut for showing implementation of a method above the methodin new small window  like this when studio shows documentation  In my opinion it will be convenient to know it, because in that way it is not necessary to go to implementation and to go up and down in the code. Unfortunately I couldnt find it when I try to google it. Thanks in advance.p

This is how I would do itp  precodevar Jim  new Personage, name Jim.active.push Jim  var Tim  new Personage, name Tim.active.push Tim  codepre  pWhat I expected from this, is for Tim.active[0] to be Jim and for Jim.active[1] to be Tim. p  pThe problem is, is that I want the codeactive.push[ self id ]code to be called  when a new Person is created, without the second line doing it.

The problem is that I want my object to do exactly this, but I want the constructor to begin like the first one I provided with codethis.active.pushcode appended later in the code.p  pHow do I expect this to be solved My thoughts were that since the codeactivecode array could be initiated anytime inside the program, that the functions constructor could somehow append codethis.active.pushcode to the end of it at right after codePerson.prototype.active  []code is executed.p  pSomething that may look likep  precodePerson.prototype.active  [] Person.prototype.append functionthis.active.pushthis  codepre  pThe second line would morph the first object constructor to look like the second one.p

Negative 2529 pI have three ViewModels MainViewModel, PreferencesViewModel and ColourControllerViewModel  the latter 2 are properties of the MainViewModel.p  pColourControllerViewModel is used for the ColourSelector view, where various colours can be created and deleted.

Negative 2529 pIve read through several similar questions, but none of them apply to this case.p  pTheres a div, which contains cells. Each cell is the same size. The div should be variable width, and allow overflow. There will be more cells that can fit into one row. The problem is, the contents are leftaligned. Please see the example here a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netgpcpfbmb relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netgpcpfbmbap  precodeltdiv idholdergt   ltdiv idcellgt     ltimg width160 height100 srchttplorempixel.com160100 gtltbr gtCaption   ltdivgt lt ... etc gt ltdivgt codepre  pThis could be fixed from JavaScript write a function which measures the screen width, calculate the number of columns, then set the width of the div to columns  cell width pixels. E.g., in the example, if youre seeing 3 columns, and the cell width is 170 pixels in this case, 3  170  510, setting the width to em510pxem would give the perfect result. However, as soon as the browser window is resized, all the benefits of variable width and auto overflow are lost.p  pSo is it possible to have the cells centered, using emonlyem CSSp

Negative 2529 pOn a blog of mine, a user asked me if I could tell him his password from that account, which happens to be the same password he used on multiple accounts, on an email which was deactived  the point is he needs that specific password.p  pSince the only option in the Wordpress Dashboard is to change the password, I had to look in phpmyadmin, under wpusers table at his password. The things is, the password is encrypted unde wordpresss unique encoding hash, phpass I believe, since it starts with PB. If it was 2008 again and wordpress wouldve used MD5 to enconde password in sql tables, it would have been easier.p  pFrom my knowledge I know that phpass pasword cant be decrypted, naturally, since its a oneway encryption method. The only way would be to bruteforce it, which is out of the question.p  pAnd then, I thought about resending the user an email containing the password. I searched the plugins page and found one named Resend Welcome email which still resets it eventualy. I think that this method is plausable, because, if I change the password in the wpusers table with another one encoded in phpass, he can login with the new one, so Wordpress somehow verifies it by encoding or decoding it, or by enconding it and comparing the hash of the password entered with the one already present in the wpusers table, under that users row.p  pIs there a plugin available or a turnaround to this situations I overthinked the whole situation and now Im out of solutions which are in my league of knowledge.p

Negative 2529 pBased on what research Ive done, I suspect that a keyvalue store is NOT the way to go, but I wanted to get more directed input top  ol liDetermine if a key value store is even a viable solution for my usage. li liBe able to articulate my reasons for preferring a document store instead.li ol  h2To explain my use caseh2  pI have an application that consists of many documents. These are currently being stored in a sort of CMIS repository. The application, however, only ever interacts with these documents after theyve been indexed into elasticsearch. This means that ALL read operations will hit elasticsearch, and all write operations will update both elasticsearch and the repository.p  pRequested features have revealed that the current repository is much too strict and that theres zero reason to enforce a model schema at that level. This, of course, has led to an investigation in NoSQL options.p  pIn order to populate these documents into the elasticsearch index, they need to live somewhere and I must be able to strongget allstrong and paginate through them as they load into the index theres also some aggregation that occurs at this step in order to populate fields that are built off of existing fields.p  pRight now, the strongget allstrong is actually being done in stages based on the type of document, but this requirement may be negotiable and instead a plain strongget all of all typesstrong could suffice but would not be ideal.p  pIn my understanding of keyvalue stores, the store knows nothing about the values it stores, and they can only be referenced by a key. This causes me to wonder if I could even perform a strongget allstrong when I dont plan on maintaining a full list of the keys anywhere. Ive seen that some keyvalue stores support using dictionaries as the key redis. Im not sure if this means I could query by type if it were an entry in the dictionary or if I would need to know the full dictionary to be able to fetch the valuep  pSince the population of the index should only need to happen if there was an elasticsearch failure, performance is not my top priority but it certainly would not hurt. To me, MongoDB seems to be a near perfect fit. I can store documents and easily query by type.p  ul liGiven my use case, does a document store seem like a good decision li liCould this also be solved reasonably by a keyvalue store li liAre there any other advantages to using one over anotherli ul  pIn case it matters, for document stores Ive been comparing CouchDB, Couchbase, and MongoDB. For keyvalue stores Ive been looking at Redis and BerkeleyDB.p

Negative 2529 pI have mashed up a VBA script from various web sources to save selected Outlook 2013 mailitems as .msg files on the filesystem. This works well but I want to add things to the item properties shown in Windows Explorer Windows 7.p  pA web search has thrown up confusing info as most seem to assume I want to change CustomProperties or BuiltinProperties but after a lot of time, it appears that what the DSOfile dll does for some other MS Office files is what I need.p  pIn summary, I can select and run a macro to rename and save mail items to the file system as msg files. I am looking for a way to have those items on the file system show additional information when viewed in Windows Explorer.

Negative 2529 pI dont like the way Gadfly chooses axis limits when plotting, for example one of the plots I produced only had data in the center quarter of the canvas.

Negative 2529 pI have an SSRS report for a student that lists indicators 1.1, 2.1, 5.3 etc down the left hand side column and a horizontal databar that displays a rating from 3 to 7 with conditional formatting. The bars line up underneath one of 5 textbox headers to show whether they are making progress, accomplished etc. The indicators are grouped by a Domain header that extends the length of the report so the report shows Domain 1 on the first line followed by a couple of indicators and corresponding databars, followed by Domain 2 header and a set of indicators and databars, etc. p  pI would like to have a vertical line that crosses the databar at each of the ratings but not through the headers. The position of the line could be based on the rating value or the left position of textboxes 25 at the top of the report. Ive experimented with striplines, but have not been able to get one to even display. Can they even be used with a databar Thanks for any suggestions.p

Negative 2529 pWhen updating SimpleForm in the edit field it automatically redirects you with a codepatchcode request. Im having trouble finding a way to work around that so it updates and redirects to the codeshowcode method. p  pI have a picture that belongs to an album when a user is viewing that picture in codepictureshowcode it shows their description underneath and the comments. If the user clicks edit theyre redirected to the codepictureeditcode view which has the same view as the codepictureshowcode but instead of their description it has the edit field to change the description using SimpleForm. When they submit or hit enter I would like it to take them right back to the show method so that it appears to all be happening on the same page without having to add any javascript. Currently, it is redirecting them to the codepictureindexcode page. p  pI cant seem to figure out a work around for the codepatchcode request though, nor have I really found anything on the internet addressing this which I find a little odd and I hope its not something super simple that I overlooked.p  proutesp  precode  editalbumpicture GET      usernamealbumsalbumidpicturesidedit.format picturesedit        albumpicture GET      usernamealbumsalbumidpicturesid.format      picturesshow                      PATCH    usernamealbumsalbumidpicturesid.format      picturesupdate                      PUT      usernamealbumsalbumidpicturesid.format      picturesupdate codepre  pPictureEditp  precodeltdiv classrowgt   ltdiv classspan7 offset1gt         lt imagetagpicture.imageurl.tos, class imgpolaroid gt         ltbr gt         lt if currentuser  user gt             lt simpleformfor[album, picture], url albumpicturepathalbum, picture , method put, html class formhorizontal do f gt               lt f.errornotification gt               lt f.input description, label gt false, inputhtml  class inputxxlarge, rows 3  gt               lt f.submit submit, class signupbutton submitonenter gt             lt end gt         lt end gt     ltdivgt    ltdiv classspan3 offset1gt     lt render layoutsadvertisements gt   ltdivgt ltdivgt lt linkto back, albumpicturepathalbum, picture gt codepre  pnotice the back link is being redirected to the same place but with a codegetcode request and works perfectly. p  pAny help would be much appreciated p

Negative 2529 pThe call backs arent being fired, cant see whats wrong, I bought the 5 pack of samples and as far as I can tell Im following their pattern properly. Ive used this before successfully.p  pSo in this class below a particular button has been either pressed or is being deselected. In this case Im specifically debugging the selected tween, but neither work properly. The InstantSelectionSpritesUp function works fine, it manually reaches in and sets the colors alpha back up to 1. This works fine, so Ive commented it out and am now trying the tween. The tween does not work. Via the Debug.Log I know that SetAsSelected and FadeSelectionSpritesUp are in fact being called. UpdateIconAlpha and UpdateBGAlpha are not being called though, because there is no log printing to the console. StopTweens is there because iTween doesnt automatically destroy preexisting tweens when you call new ones on the same GameObject. I have commented this out and nothing changes, so thats not the issue. Its gotta be something wrong with how Ive formatted the iTween call.p  precodepublic class NavigationButton  MonoBehaviour  this is the super class for all of the navigation buttons  public UISprite bgDeselected public UISprite bgSelected public UISprite iconDeselected public UISprite iconSelected  protected bool isCurrentlySelected  false protected float fadeTime  0.5f protected Color alphaZero  new Color 1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f  protected Color alphaOne  new Color 1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f      void Start       make the selected state of the button zero instantly so the user doesnt see it at all on app load     InstantSelectionSpritesDown      public void SetAsSelected      Debug.Log  this.gameObject.name  SetAsSelected        this funcion is called because this button has been pressed      we want this button to now show as being selected     FadeSelectionSpritesUp     InstantSelectionSpritesUp      isCurrentlySelected  true   public void SetAsDeselected      Debug.Log  this.gameObject.name  SetAsDeselected        this funcion is called because the button another button in the nav has been pressed      we want this button to now show as being not selected     FadeSelectionSpritesDown     InstantSelectionSpritesDown      isCurrentlySelected  false      protected void FadeSelectionSpritesDown      Debug.Log  this.gameObject.name  FadeSelectionSpritesDown  iconSelected.gameObjecticonSelected.gameObject  bgSelected.gameObjectbgSelected.gameObject       StopTweens       this function fades the alpha of the BG and Icon sprites down to 0 alpha     iTween.ValueTo iconSelected.gameObject ,iTween.Hash from, 1.0f, to, 0.0f, time, fadeTime, onUpdate, UpdateIconAlpha     iTween.ValueTo bgSelected.gameObject ,iTween.Hash from, 1.0f, to, 0.0f, time, fadeTime, onUpdate, UpdateBGAlpha   protected void FadeSelectionSpritesUp      Debug.Log  this.gameObject.name  FadeSelectionSpritesUp  iconSelected.gameObjecticonSelected.gameObject  bgSelected.gameObjectbgSelected.gameObject       StopTweens       this function fades the alpha of the BG and Icon sprites up to 100     iTween.ValueTo iconSelected.gameObject ,iTween.Hash from, 0.0f, to, 1.0f, time, fadeTime, onUpdate, UpdateIconAlpha     iTween.ValueTo bgSelected.gameObject ,iTween.Hash from, 0.0f, to, 1.0f, time, fadeTime, onUpdate, UpdateBGAlpha      protected void StopTweens       iTween doesnt destroy tweens that are already going if a new tween is added to the same object, so we need to destroy existing tweens manually     iTween.StopiconSelected.gameObject     iTween.StopbgSelected.gameObject   protected void UpdateIconAlpha float alphaAsFloat       Debug.Log  this.gameObject.name  UpdateIconAlpha  alphaAsFloatalphaAsFloat  bgSelected.gameObjecticonSelected       iconSelected.color  new Color alphaOne.r, alphaOne.g, alphaOne.b, alphaAsFloat    protected void UpdateBGAlpha float alphaAsFloat       Debug.Log  this.gameObject.name  UpdateBGAlpha  alphaAsFloatalphaAsFloat  bgSelected.gameObjectbgSelected       bgSelected.color  new Color alphaOne.r, alphaOne.g, alphaOne.b, alphaAsFloat       protected void InstantSelectionSpritesDown       this function instantly sets the alpha of the BG and Icon sprites to 0 alpha     iconSelected.color  alphaZero     bgSelected.color  alphaZero   protected void InstantSelectionSpritesUp       this function instantly sets the alpha of the BG and Icon sprites to 100 alpha     iconSelected.color  alphaOne     bgSelected.color  alphaOne  codepre  pAny thoughtsp  pThanks Delap  pRebelFuture.com OpenSourceRebellion.comp

However, this does not make quite sense to me, since Controller1 and 2 have a emveryem similar requestmapping and yet the controllers match differentlyp  pEverything is handled by the dispatcher servlet.p  pDoes anyone have a hint what may be happeningp

Negative 2529 pIm asking myself for a while how to do CDI in Netbeans Platform especially with TopComponents or subclasses of them. Now im using LookUps to get my dependencies and for intermodulecommunication and its working fine, but the dependencies of my components are not visible to the outside like it is using CDI so Im searching for a way to populate the constructors of my TopComponents with the right arguments LooseCoupled trough interface types. I currently using 3 modulesp  ul liAPI  contains the interfacesli liCore  contains implementations of the interfaces, have API as a dependencyli liGUI  contains my GUI and logic code encapsulated in TopComponents also have a dependency on APIli ul  pAs you see both Modules GUI and Core rely on API because of the loosecoupling in the modular system. I think it is nice to use LookUps to find the right implementations for the interfaces in API but as I said I also want to have the dependencies visible to the outside of my component classes.p  pstrongSo is there any way for doing Constructor Dependency Injection in a modular loosecoupled architecture using Netbeans PlatformVersion 8.0.2 and if yes howstrongp  pIf no what is the best solution to provide a clear view on the dependencies of the component classesp  pAny help will be appreciated.p

Negative 2529 pIm creating a node.js service in which I have to request some other server about some users private information. The other server wants me to make a byte stream, including URL, Query Parameters, HTTP Method, Headers and some other information. Then hash this byte stream using SHA256 algorithm and then sign it using the private key.p  pSo I have to first generate a privatepublic key pair and then I also need to submit to the server the proof key object which contains the curve points x,y that were used in the generation of public keys. The x and Y must have same length as well, its a constraint.p  pMy problem is that I cant install any thing on our servers thats a constraint as well so we need a lib thats completely js code and not like cryptopp which is just a wrapper that depends upon c code which needs to be present on the server.p  pI found many modules that generates public and private keys plus they also hash and sign the message as well but they dont give the X,Y curve points.p

Negative 2529 pThis is more of general where do I find good resources to do something question.  I am attempting to use Python OpenCV or otherwise to classify images based on a training set.p  pMy training set  this is made up of numerous images of product defects.  Each image can be taken in 1 of 3 locations on the product and each image will contain 1 of 5 types of product defects.  The defects have been manually classified and validated by a human.p  pImages to classify  These are made up of similar images, taken in the same 3 locations but the type of defect is not classified although the defective area IS recognized by the tool taking the picture, its just that the tool does not CORRECTLY classify them and I cant change the tool. p  pI have attempted to do this classification following recommendations in the book Programming Computer Vision with Python  Tools and algorithms for analyzing images.  In this case I use SIFT descriptors stored in a mySQL database training data in a Bag of Words approach.  So far I am not having too much luck I continue to troubleshoot and thought Id seek advice from any OpenCV experts out there.p  pAny references or advice would be much appreciated.p  pSo, coming back to the question I thought that it would be worth sharing what Ive learned.  I dont know that its the answer but this is where Ive ended up.  A work in progress, you can always get better.p  pMy solution right now has been to combine 3 different approaches.  All are searchable on the internet so I wont go to great detail on the how.  p  pFirst, I used the SIFT approach, generating SIFT histograms using a command line call to VLFeat.  This may be an option elsewhere in Python, its just what I used.  I used kmeans clustering to do the visual bag of words vocabulary thing and built a database tying the centroids to word histograms associated with the training images.  I improved results a bit by adding a Root SIFT step.  Then I created a separate database using Dense SIFT but no Root SIFT adjustments.  Lastly, I created a database of color histograms based on the RGB components of the training images.  I dont use all 256 bins of RGB but went with summing individual R,G and B values over 8 bins and then flattening the values to a 24 bin histogram.p  pThis same process is followed with the unknown images, and then histogram vectors are compared using Euclidean distance.  I tried Chi Squared comparison as well but, in my case Euclidean provided better results.  I take the top 3 results from each process, with image classification based on 5 of 9 vote.  If a majority isnt reached then the analysis is indeterminate.  p  pFor my closed population of images I am at 3.1 misclassification rate, 3.1 indeterminate. p

Negative 2529 pWell, I really messed up yesterday... I tried to install Ubuntu alongside my Windows 8.1 installation.p  pSo I first backed up my data with a backup application on an external hard drive. Then I created a CD with the Ubuntu OS on it to install it within the live system.p  pWhen I came up to Ubuntu asking me how to install, I chose Alongside Windows 8.1. Linux installed itself on my machine, I rebooted and ended up inside the GRUB bootloader asking me, wether I wanted to start up windows or linux. I chose windows, just to test wether it was still working. It did. I needed a USB port, so I removed the backup hard drive, what was connected to my computer the whole process. Later I rebootet my computer to test the linux installation.p  pAnd then horror began. Grub did not loaded itself, but crashed with the error No Such device [device no] entering rescue mode And I got a simple console without even a help command. Thank you for that, GRUB.p  pI reconnected my external drive... no effect UEFI told me, I can choose different devices, but I always ended up with rescue GRUB. I booted up from the live CD and researched my partitions. When linux told me, that the only linux partition was found on my external hard drive, I realised what had happened... I attached my hard drive to another USB port and rebooted again. Now grub was working again and let me choose my OS of desire.p  pSo How can I bypass GRUB, to load up windows again, without the hard drive attached. And how do I uninstall linux from my hard drive AND install it safely on my internal hard drivep

Negative 2529 pIm starting to develop an AVRIDE for developing various AVRBoards on Linux. I just want a simple IDE with tools for debuggingsimavr, compilinggcc for avr, and uploading avrdude. Maybe at a later moment I will be adding tools for setting breakpoints, setting fusess and so on. Im totally open to any programming IDE  programming language with whom I would like to realize it. Only requirement is a simple integration of a VIM like editor preferably with syntax highlighting and plugin support, but I could add that later on. Even an emulation of the standard functions of VIM would be enough. But writing the complete VIM emulator by myself would be too much work I think there is probably a better workaround. Do you know any way of integrating VIM into a self made qt application, or a gtk application, or a gtk application...  Tips on chosing which language I shall use, and tips on how to integrate a simpe VIM editor are welcome but dont think I dont have experience with the different programming languages  IDEs, gtk, gtk, qt... I just want to hear your considerations.p  pThanks alot, ICEBERGp

Negative 2529 pI am currently working to add OSGi modularity to a project for the purpose of strongpluginsstrong. The basic idea is that users can develop their own strongpluginsstrong that can be added at runtime to the main application to extend or modify its functions andor capabilities.p  pFor example, the main application uses Restlets to define an HTTP API for the application. The user may wish to create a plugin to add an endpoint with a specific function. Or they may wish to create a new entity that is stored in the database with a specific purpose.p  pI understand that this is not a true OSGi modular application implementation and after some research I managed to quite easily add OSGi capability to the existing project with embedded codeFelixcode. Along with codefelix.fileinstallcode the application watches a deploy folder and automatically installs and starts the jar bundles that are dropped into the deploy folder stops and uninstalls when removed.p  pSo the basic idea is implemented and work great. What Im struggling to understand is how I define and publish the main applications API that can be implemented by any strongpluginstrong bundles. On the flip side I dont understand how bundle developers can gain access to that API infop  pIn order for a bundle developer to be able to utilise the API they would need some sort of SDKp

Negative 2529 pI work on a project building an iOS framework. The framework is built using some legacy script that combines a number of static libraries .a files into a single framework.p  pCurrently we strip all debug symbols from the framework using the strip command on the individual static libraries that contribute to the framework and also by specifying Strip Debug Symbols During CopyYES, Strip Linked Product YES, Generate Debug Symbols NO , Symbols Hidden by Default YES in the xCode project build options for the individual obcC libraries we build ourselves.p  pThe problem is that we want some BUT NOT ALL users of the library to have access to the framework debug information so they can generate more complete crash logs. Currently users of our framework cannot see any of the frameworks internal debug symbols.p  pIs it possible to generate a .dSYM file for the framework itself Can users then combine this framework .dSYM with the .dSYM file for their app in order to  generate a fully symbolicated crash logsp
