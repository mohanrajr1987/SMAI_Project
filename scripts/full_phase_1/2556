Positive 2556 pEDIT how is this question different from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions22637900java8lambdasvsanonymousclassesJava8 Lambdas vs Anonymous classesa The answers provided in the previous question are regarding of how they work in a higher level. I already understand the syntax benefits. My question here is regarding the facts, that anonymous classes are ultimately obejct isntances, and lambdas strongare not objectsstrong. I want to understand the differences and implications under the hood of this mechanism and how does it work.p  pSo, the first notable difference is naturally in the syntax. The second is that as far as I udnerstand, lambdas may only be implemented as FunctionalInterfaces which requires that the interface we are implementing have only one method, which allows better inference.p  pPremise as I understand a functional interface has a nonobject method a hrefhttpcr.openjdk.java.netbriangoetzlambdalambdatranslation.html relnofollowsource hereap  pMy question is, exactly how do they differ under the hood, by this I mean, if how are they difference in a sense that anonymous classes are instanciated, they ultimately objects, but lambdas.. are not This is what I dont fully understand, are lambdas not really instances of objects What are the real differences of lambdas not being objects in comparison to an anonymous classp

Positive 2556 pSuppose in C, we have following struct p  precodestruct MyData      char key1[20]     long key2     ...   some data   codepre  pEssentially, in addition to some data, we have two keys key1 and key2. Suppose we need to manage a bunch of objects of emMyDataem in two different ways, for example, to quickly find corresponding object based on either key1 or key2 but not both. One way to meet this requirement is to build two different RBtrees or hashtables according to the two keys, respectively. In CC, the data need not to be duplicated since we only need to record the pointers of objects.p  pIn above hypothetical example, the key point is that we have a bunch of data with same type and we can organized it through two different data structures without duplicating the data in imperative language. I am wondering how pure functional programming can efficiently meet this requirement without duplicating data. To make it more general or challenging, the two data structures may not be of same type. For example, one could be rbtree and the other could be hashtable. p  pIf possible, please layout your solution in Haskell. p  pPS As a newbie to functional programming, I couldnt help wondering how to achieve some tricks from imperative programming in a pure functional programming. I know sometimes it doesnt make sense at all. If someone feels this question is also pointless, please layout the detail reasoning. p  pThanks p

Negative 2556 pIve just recently completed a personal project and one technique I did use to break down the interface was to have one main Model View Controller that was handling a lot of the main logic of the application. Then for the most part, there were many generic controls lets say a Slider and a Text Field that were bound together to a single float value. They themselves would make up another Model View Controller that the parent Model View Controller would interact with. Though the communication would allays be down hill, never self reflecting loop.p  pSo in general, The controller would interact with the controller of the Slider and textField that were bound together. But both did not have access directly to each others view, so when a event did occur for the Controller of the Text field and slider it would be handled by the parent controller that would handle most of the logical flow of the program then down to the controller of the slider and text field.p  pThis worked great and got a lot of great responses of the users who used the application and loved the flex ability it did bring with very logical readjusting controls that they didnt have to think.p  pThough the developer in me questions the pragmatism and purity of the design. The design of the system was a top town approach that I took from this Adobe post castp  pAdobe, general algorithms a hrefhttpwww.youtube.comwatchv4moyKUHApq4 relnofollowhttpwww.youtube.comwatchv4moyKUHApq4ap  p,and generally usage of using MVC as objects inside objects reflected this instead of one global MVC controller.p  pAnd suggestions where i could improve in the next project or should i use this same approach againp

Negative 2556 pIm getting some strange behaviour from an Oracle instance Im working on. This is 11gR1 on Itanium, no RAC, nothing fancy. Ultimately Im moving data from one Oracle instance to another in a data warehouse scenario.p  pI have a semicomplex view running over a DB link 4 inner joins over largeish tables and 5 left joins over midsize tables.p  pHeres the problem when I test the view in SQL Developer or SQLPlus it seems fine, no duplication whatsoever. However, when I actually use the view to insert data into a table I get a large number of dupes.p  pEDIT  The data is going into an empty table. All of the tables in the query are on the database link. The only thing passed into the query is a date e.g. INSERT INTO target SELECT  FROM view WHERE view.datecol  dQueryDate  p  pIve tried adding a ROWNUMBER function to the select statement, partitioned by the PK for the view. All rows come back numbered as 1. Again though, the same statement run as an insert generates the same dupes as before and now conveniently numbered. The number of duped rows is not the same per key. Some records exist 4 times some only exist once.p  pI find this to behaviour to be extremely perplexing.  It reminds me of working with Teradata where you have SET tables unique rows only and MULTISET tables duplicate rows allowed but Oracle has no such functionality.p  pA select that returns rows to the client should behave identically to one that inserts those rows to another location. I cant imagine a legitimate reason for this to happen, but maybe Im suffering from a failure of imagination. p  pI wonder if anyone else has experienced this or if its a bug on this platform.p  pstrongSOLUTIONstrongp  pThanks to Gary, I was able to get to the bottom of this by using EXPLAIN PLAN FOR my query and SELECT  FROM TABLEdbmsxplan.display. The explain that emactually gets usedem for the INSERT is very different from the SELECT.p  pFor the SELECT most of the plan operations are TABLE ACCESS BY INDEX ROWID and INDEX UNIQUE SCAN. The Predicate Information block contains all of the joins and filters from the query. At the end it says strongNote  fully remote statementstrong. p  pFor the INSERT there is no reference to the indexes. The Predicate Information block is just three lines and a new Remote SQL block shows strong9strong small SQL statements. p  pThe database has split my query into 9 subqueries and then attempts to join them locally. By running the smaller selects Ive located the source of the duplicates. p  pstrongI believe this is bug in the Oracle compiler around remote links.strong It creates logical flaws when rewriting the SQL. Basically the compiler is not properly applying the WHERE clause. I was just testing it and gave it an IN list of 5 keys to bring back. SELECT brings back 5 rows. INSERT puts 77,000 rows into the target and strongtotally ignores the IN list.strongp  pemStill looking for a way to force the correct behaviour, I may have to ask for the view to be created on the remote database although that is not ideal from a development viewpoint.

Negative 2556 pI am using a JEE6 stack including JPA 2.0, JSF 2.0, EJB 3.1 etc.p  pThe way my architecture is setup is the followingp  pI have JPA annotated DAOs using hibernate as my JPA provider.  I have JSF Managed beans which correspond to my faceletxhtml pages. I have EJBs that handle all of my database requests.p  pMy XHTML pages have JSF EL which make calls to my Managed beans. My managed beans contain references to my DAO entities which are managed by EJBs. For example, I have a user entity which is mapped to a db table. I have a user EJB which handles all CRUD operations that return Users. I have a page that edits a user. The highlevel workflow would be navigate to user edit page  EL calls a method located in the managed bean that loads a user. The method calls userEJB.loadUseruser from the EJB to get the user from the database. The user is edited and submit  a function is called in the managed bean which calls a function in the EJB to save the user. etc.p  pI am running into issues accessing my data within my JSF pages using EJBs. I am having a lot of problems with lazy initialization errors, which I believe is due to how I have set things up.p  pFor example, I have a Client entity that has a List of users which are lazily loaded. In order to get a client I call a method in my EJB which goes to the database, finds a client and returns it. Later on i wish to access this clients list of users, in order to do so i have to go back to the EJB by calling some sort of method in order to load those users since they are lazily loaded. This means that I have to create a method such as p  precodepublic ListltUsergt getUserListByClientClient c      c  em.mergec return c.getUserList  codepre  pThe only purpose of this method is to load the users and Im not even positive this approach is good or works. If i was doing session management myself, I would like just leave the session open for the entire request and access the property directly, this would be fine as the session would be open anyway, there seems to be this one extra layer of indirection in EJBs which is making things difficult for me.p  pI do like EJBs as I like the fact that they are controlled by the container, pooled, offer transaction management for free etc. However, I get the feeling that I am using them incorrectly, or I have set up my JSF app incorrectly.p  pAny feedback would be greatly appreciated.p  pthanks,p

Negative 2556 pI am dealing with a MySQL table here that is keyed in a somewhat unfortunate way. Instead of using an auto increment table as a key, it uses a column of decimals to preserve order presumably so its not too difficult to insert new rows while preserving a primary key and order.p  pBefore I go through and redo this table to something more sane, I need to figure out how to rekey it without breaking everything.p  pWhat I would like to do is something that takes a list of doubles the current keys and outputs a list of integers which can be cast down to doubles for rekeying.p  pFor example, input 1.00, 2.00, 2.50, 2.60, 3.00 would give output 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.p  pSince this is a database, I also need to be able to update the rows nicelyp  precodeUPDATE table SET key3.00 WHERE key2.50 codepre  pCan anyone think of a speedy algorithm to do this My current thought is to read all of the doubles into a vector, take the size of the vector, and output a new vector with values from code1 gt doubleVector.sizecode. This seems pretty slow, since you wouldnt want to read every value into the vector if, for instance, only the last coden100code elements needed to be modified. p  pI think there is probably something I can do in place, since only values after the first noninteger double need to be modified, but I cant for the life of me figure anything out that would let me update in place as well. For instance, setting 2.60 to 3.00 the first time you see 2.50 in the original key list would result in an error, since the key value 3.00 is already used for the table.p  hr  pEdit I guess what this really abstracts to is this p  pI need a way to convert an ordered map keyed  with doubles into an ordered map keyed with integers, where at no point does there ever exist two values for one key which is a violation of a map anyway.p

Negative 2556 pSuppose that we have the following partial ER diagramp  pimg srchttpdl.dropbox.comu151329schema.png altAn ER diagram with 5 entities messages, submissions, attachments, assignments, and lecturesp  pNotice that the codeattachmentscode table will subsequently be used for the messages, submissions, assignments, and lectures attachments.p  pThe problem is with the 3 onetoone relationships between codeattachmentscode and codemessagescode, codesubmissionscode, and codeassignmentscode. According to CakePHPs conventions, codeMessage belongsTo Attachmentcode and codeAttachment hasOne Messagecode because codeMessagecode contains the foreign key the same thing applies to the other 2 relationships. Of course, it makes more sense to say that codeMessage hasOne Attachmentcode and that codeAttachment belongsTo Messagecode. If we only had codemessagescode and codeattachmentscode, it would be easy to emproperly orientem the relationship by moving the foreign key to codeattachmentscode.p  pBut the problem again is that codemessagescode, codesubmissionscode, codeassignmentscode, and codelecturescode have relationships with the same codeattachmentscode table. One way to get the emsemantically correctem relationships is to have 4 different codeAttachmentcode models codeMessageAttachmentcode, codeSubmissionAttachmentcode, codeAssignmentAttachmentcode, and codeLectureAttachmentcode.p  pAssuming we are only interested in retrieving the attachment of a certain message, submission, or assignment, strongis it OK to use these emsemantically reversedem associations, or should we emproperly orientem them by separating codeAttachmentcode into 4 different models as mentioned abovestrongp

Negative 2556 pI have a flex website using Django and Ive got it working previously in a test environment. I also emessentiallyem got it running in a shared environment at A Small Orange using FastCGI. I followed their Wiki example to do this exactly   a hrefhttpwiki.asmallorange.comHOWTODjangoFastCGI relnofollowhttpwiki.asmallorange.comHOWTODjangoFastCGIa.  I emphasize I emessentiallyem got it working, as although it will run for long  stretches without problems, every once a while some unknown thing discombobulates it, and it starts dropping files.  And there is no rhyme or reason to what type of files it drops. Sometimes its just static files,  and sometimes only one type of static file, e.g. image files requested  in Flex via SWFLoader. Other times its only font files. But then in other circumstances it will hiccup instead on XML files dynamically created by Django from templates and requested from the flex app using URLLoader and URLRequest.p  pAnd there is no pattern as to what will initially trigger this behavior to start occurring.  Before writing this, I thought I had determined that if I clear the browser cache so it has to request all of the files again from the server  and also kill the FastCGI process on the server so it also  has to restart codedispatch.fcgicode in that Wiki, then My DJangoFCGI program would always fail on the initial file request.  And sure enough, time after time this was happening.  But just now I started trying the exact same thing again and now its fine. But no matter  at some point in the not to distant future, it will start failing again, but in some completely different scenario and repeatable at least for a while.    There seems to be more problems with Firefox than an IEbased browser, thought this could be coincidence as well.p  pThis is not a heavily trafficked site at all yet.  No ones visiting it except me, to the best of my knowledge.  But simulataneous web page requests initiated by me from different browsers dont appear to present a particular problem to it.p  pSo does the above sound familiar to anyone.p

Is there any other way i can cache the data before sending it I know that I can send the data directly, but i need to send the cache instead, since i want to send it to more than one browserp  pTo save the chunks i usep  precodefunction getURLu       u  url.parseu      var client  http.createClientu.port  80, u.hostname      var request  client.requestGET, ,                              Host u.hostname,                                var cache        cache.data  []       request.end      request.onresponse, functionresponse            cache.statusCode  response.statusCode           cache.headers  response.headers            response.ondata, functionchunk                 cache.data.pushchunk        codepre  pto send the cache, i usep  precodefunction sendCacheresponse, cache      var writeSuccess  []     response.writeHeadcache.statusCose, cache.headers     for var i in cache.data           dont encode the data, leave it as it is         writeSuccess[i]  response.writecache.data[i], binary         console.logchunk   i   is of length                cache.data[i].length  .

In the node.js API, it is not explained if this function returns something or not, but i just tried it out. p  pWhat i noticed, the response.write was sometimes true and then false for other chunks of the cache whereas if i directly send the response without caching, response.write of all chunks is true.p  pIf anyone notice something wrong i am doing, or knows a better way to cache the data preferably in binary so that all nonascii characters show too please help me ....p  pthanks a lot in advance,p  pSabah p

Negative 2556 pMy questions is, Why would a language designer consider allowing comparison between different data types. Also, does this make more sense in a functional languagep  pFor example, in erlang one can perform the following comparisonsp  precode Tuples are greater than numbers 999999 lt 1,2. true   Lists are greater than tuples 90000 lt [1]. true   Atoms are greater than numbers 1 lt false. true codepre  pIn python 2.x as well,p  precodep  lambda x,y xy  p gt 1 True  p lt 1 False  p  1 False codepre  pThough looks like the python community decided this wasnt a good idea after all  p  blockquote   pobjects of different types always   compare unequal, and are ordered   consistently but arbitrarily.   [...]   This unusual definition of comparison   was used to simplify the definition of   operations like sorting and the in and   not in operators.   a hrefhttpdocs.python.orgreferenceexpressions.html relnofollowsourceap blockquote  pFrom the Python 3 release notep  blockquote   pThe ordering comparison operators lt,   lt, ,  raise a TypeError exception   when the operands dont have a   meaningful natural ordering. Thus,   expressions like 1 lt , 0  None or   len lt len are no longer valid, and   e.g. None lt None raises TypeError   instead of returning False. A   corollary is that sorting a   heterogeneous list no longer makes   sense  all the elements must be   comparable to each other.   a hrefhttpdocs.python.orgrelease3.0.1whatsnew3.0.html relnofollowsourceap blockquote  pThis kind of explains why, but I was wondering if there are other reasons to allow this, particularly in functional languages.  p

Negative 2556 pI would like to create a QPixmap to draw on using a QPainter. The QPixmap should support transparency without using premultiplied color channels.p  pCurrently I do this by creating a QPixmap with the desired dimensions and filling it with a QColor that has been set to zero for each channel including alpha.p  precodetex  QtGui.QPixmapwidth, height c  QtGui.QColor0 c.setAlpha0 tex.fillc codepre  pThis adds transparency to the QPixmap. However, if I draw to the QPixmap using a QPainter, the drawn color values are premultiplied by the alpha value of the source. I dont want this because the QPixmap is later used as a texture in a QGLWidget and upon rendering the alpha channel of the QPixmap now the alpha of the source that was drawn using the QPainter is again multiplied against the color channels, so that the alpha is multiplied twice.p  pIf I use a QImage with format QtGui.QImage.FormatARGB32 in place of the QPixmap, then the color channels are not premultiplied and the alpha is applied only once. However this is too slow during rendering. I have tried to draw on QImages with the above format and then convert to QPixmaps, but got the same result premultiplied color channels again being multiplied by the alpha channel. The Trolltech docs say, p  blockquote   pDepending on the system, QPixmap is   stored using a RGB32 or a   premultiplied alpha format. If the   image has an alpha channel, and if the   system allows, the preferred format is   premultiplied alpha.p blockquote  pI am using X Linux. Is there any way to force a QPixmap to not premultiply the color channels when that QPixmap has an alpha channelp

Negative 2556 pOur ASP.NET software uses a MSSQL database. We periodically have new releases of our software which sometimes include changes to our database.p  pCurrently we write an SQL update script for each release that updates the database, based on the previous version and the new version.

Negative 2556 pIm new to CakePHP, though not new at all to MVC frameworks for web development. Id normally go with Drupal when doing web sites that are not web apps but my employee feels that coding stuff from the ground up is far better than using pre built well tested and working solutions.

It seemed that callingp  precodehtml  thisgtrequestActioninternalurl, arrayreturn codepre  pwould have returned the fully rendered HTML as if my user directly requested internalurl but its not the case. I only get the HTML for the actions view, without all the awesome layout stuff.p  pIm going this databasecontroller way because Id like sites admins to be able to edit the aliases via browser, not by editing some obscure routing directives or the .htacces. Its also much quicker to log in, create a page, set the alias and go out for lunch.p  pNow how do I do itp  pstrongEDITstrong Mimicking the behaviour of appwebrootindex.php I wrote this action for my AliasControllerp  precodepublic function parse      alias  thisgtrequestgtparams[url]      record  thisgtAliasgtfindByAliasalias     request  record[Alias][request]      Dispatcher  new Dispatcher     Dispatchergtdispatchnew CakeRequestrequest, new CakeResponsearraycharset gt ConfigurereadApp.encoding      die  codepre  pExcept for the name it doesnt really parse anything, does it it works fine at least it does what I wanted it to do.

Negative 2556 pLet A be an array of arbitrary dimension 2 or 3 in my case. How can I flatten reshape to 1D this array without knowing in advance the number of dimensions p  pIf I knew the number of dimensions, I could easily obtain the total number of elements by using a combination of Array Size function and then reshape A to 1D using this number. Unfortunately, the Array Size function itself returns an array whose number of elements is equal to the number of dimensions, which brings us back to the initial problem.p  pI have solved the problem by creating a function VI that returns the total number of elements of a 3D array the most common type of arrays that I expect to handle, so that I can give this as an argument to the Reshape function. Problem it wont accept a 2D array, even though the algorithm would work with such an array  it seems that in Labview, array controls are strict about the number of dimensions they accept, which isnt the case in Matlab for instance.p  pA nice solution would be a simple way to multiply all the elements of the array given by Array Size to quickly get the total number of elements, without having to wrap this in a sub VI.

Negative 2556 pIm going to try to describe with words something that might only be describable with video.p  pI have created a simple iOS app with a storyboard containing a single image view.  I have added two gesture recognizers a UIPanGestureRecognizer and a UIRotationGestureRecognizer along with their corresponding IBActions.p  pWhen I first start the application in the simulator, the image view pans correctly.  The image view also rotates correctly.  After a rotation, however, any subsequent pan fails.  When I try to pan after a rotation, regardless of the direction of the pan, the image rapidly scales to zero and disappears, i.e., it collapses or implodes to a point that disappears.p  pThe gesture recognizers are created using the following code.  myImageView is set up as an IBOutlet UIImageView.p  precodeUIPanGestureRecognizer panRec  [[UIPanGestureRecognizer alloc] initWithTargetself actionselectorprocessPan] [myImageView addGestureRecognizerpanRec] UIRotationGestureRecognizer rotRec  [[UIRotationGestureRecognizer alloc] initWithTargetself actionselectorprocessRotation] [myImageView addGestureRecognizerrotRec] codepre  pIve written the associated actions as best I know how.

I have examined a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrary74b2wakt.aspx relnofollowthis articlea but not found a solution.p  pWhat I would ultimately like to do is to not rely on the codeAutoSizeColumnsModecode property, but rather call the code.AutoResizeColumncode method emsomewhereem to resize, so I initially autosize the column, but then allow the user to resize.p  pI have tried the following with limited or no successp  ol lipSet codeDataGridView.AutoSizeColumnsModecode to code.Nonecode.

Thus, I cannot allow user to resize columns.pli lipCalling code.UpdateCellValuecode as mentioned in the article from my code.CellValueNeededcode handler throws codeStackOverFlowExceptioncode as well.pli ol  pSo is it possible to call code.AutoResizeColumncode somewhere where it wont raise code.CellValueNeededcode until it overflows  Since 4 seems to have the ability to perform the autosize function it seems as though I could manually call it from somewhere as well.p

Ive verified its installed by checking phpinfo, and curl does have a config section on the page, indicating its installed.p  pWhen I run my entire web application starting from the index page, this php page Im trying to test finds the curlinit function without a problem.p  pWhen I run my unit test on the file, however, the it gives me the following errorp  precodePHP Fatal error Call to undefined function curlinit in ... codepre  pLike I said, the file that calls curlinit works great when run in the context of the whole application, but cant find it when its being run alone by my PHPUnit tests. Does anyone know why this is happening Does PHPUnit not know how to find the PHP extensions installed on my WAMP serverp

Negative 2556 pI am looking to create a layout for my site where a sidebar is fixed at the right side of the viewport with a 30 width content is to the left of it until the browser window reaches a certain width, at which point I want the content and sidebar to be centred and no longer grow with the browser window since it becomes hard to read at extremely large widths. Here is an idea of the html being usedp  precodeltbodygt ltdiv idsidebargtsidebar contentltdivgt ltdiv idcontentgtarticles, images, etcltdivgt codepre  pAnd here is some of the basic HTML being used to format itp  pre classlangcss prettyprintoverridecodesidebar      width 30     position fixed     right 0     top 0     backgroundcolor gray  content      width 70     marginright 30     maxwidth 49em  codepre  pAt this point, when the content gets wider than 49em, it sticks to the right side of the page creating an everincreasing gap between it and the fixed sidebar. What I would like is to have it reach a max width of 49em, have the sidebar reach 21em so they are still 7030 and remain fixed, but have that whole 70em worth of width centered in the viewport. p  pI also want the background colour of the sidebar to span the entire way from the edge of the content to the righthand side of the screen i.e. a containing div that centers both the sidebar and content with a max width of 70em doesnt work since the background of the sidebar would only go to the edge of the containing div instead of the viewport. That one isnt as important because it might look fine to put some sort of textured background on the body element to make it look like as though the page is sitting on some textured surface not ideal, but fine. I just havent been able to center the sidebar and content while maintaining the sidebars fixed positioning.p  pThanksp  pUpdate heres a very rough schematic of what I am looking forp  pABCDp  pB is the content area with a max width of 49em. C is the sidebar with max width of 21em AND it has to have fixed positioning. A and D would be the margins each half of the difference between the viewport width and 70em. Background of D must be the same colour gray as the sidebar. Background of A must be white.p

The point is, A strongdatastrong like 824 can be understood as 8024 or 8124 or 8224, etc., so does the 6th row. Therefore, If I the query is SELECT  from table WHERE data LIKE 8424, it should return the 4th and 6th row. If I use SELECT  from table WHERE data LIKE 82, the 7th row will be included, which is not what I want.p  pFinally, strongI found the solution. Its extremely simple, just use SELECT  FROM table WHERE 8424 LIKE data Thank you all for your answersstrong p

In any case, guidance here would be greatly appreciated.p  pHow frequently could I reasonably hope to poll my WCF service from an android phone on 3g Is this fast enough for something like chat between multiple users through a serverp  pIs there some android socket code I can look into Can I host my own socket server using either visual studio IIS or eclipsep

Negative 2556 pI was given a console app to be moved to a different server.  I also need to move tables used by this application to a different serverdatabase.   The new database has a different name.  The app was converted I believe from VS2005 to VS2010 before me some time ago. I changed the connection string in the app config.  This project contains entity model.  I noticed in one of the auto generated model files this line  [globalSystem.Data.Linq.Mapping.DatabaseAttributeNameOldDatabaseName]p  pThis is an autogenerated file.  Is there a way to not reference the old database without recreating the model and rebuilding the app Thank you, Jennyp

Negative 2556 pIve been reading a lot on the topic and nothing seems to quite cover my needs. Im sorry if Im repeating or unclear about something Im both new to ruby and rails and new to stackoverflow.p  pI have an existing rails application with a lot of infrastructure in it. I want to take a few of its models, nest them in a namespace and put all that into a ruby gem for use in other rails applications. From my understanding theres a problem with the loading paths for rails as they are a convention and a problem with defining another engine as then you have two and they crash.p  pIve been looking for a guide or tutorial to learn how to do this without much luck but Im positive theres something out there if someone can point me at it that would be wonderful.p  pMy attempts at making a gem with an engine fails on collisions or lack of rails.p  pIm running rails 3.2.3 and ruby 1.9.3.p

Negative 2556 pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comoN2yz.jpg althuhp  pThe character pictured above was tweeted a few months ago by a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comoN2yz.jpg relnofollowMikko Hyppnena, a computer security expert known for his work on computer viruses and a hrefhttpwww.ted.comspeakersmikkohypponen.html relnofollowTED talksa on computer security. In respect for SO, I will only post an image of it, but you get the idea. Its obviously not something youd want spreading around your website and freaking out visitors.p  pUpon further inspection, the character appears to be a letter of the Thai alphabet combined with over 87 diacritics is there even a limit. This got me thinking about security, localization, and how one might handle this sort of input. My searching lead me to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions249087howdoiremovediacriticsaccentsfromastringinnetthis questiona on Stack, and in turn a blog post from Michael Kaplan on a hrefhttpwww.siao2.com200705142629747.aspx relnofollowstripping diacriticsa. In it, he demonstrates how one can decompose a string into its base characters simplified here for the sake of brevityp  precodeStringBuilder sb  new StringBuilder foreach char c in faade.NormalizeNormalizationForm.FormD      if char.GetUnicodeCategoryc  UnicodeCategory.NonSpacingMark         sb.Appendc  Response.Writesb.ToString  facade  codepre  pI can see how that this is would be useful in some cases, but in terms of user input, it would be stripping out ALL diacritics. As Kaplan points out, removing the diacritics in some languages can completely change the meaning to the word.

Initially I thought Id be able to convert the tests in Michaels book, and I have to a small degree, but its slow progress and I seem to be constantly hitting my head against a brick wall  partly, I think, because I dont know Rspec and capybara so well have made some very dumb mistakes but also because I dont really understand Devise well enough and am wondering if Devise plays as nicely as it might with Rspec I read somewhere that, because Devise is Rack based, it might not always work as one might expect with Rspec. Dont know if thats true or notp  pI know some people will wonder why this might be necessary since Devise is a gem and therefore already tested but Ive had a couple of instances where changes elsewhere have broken login or registration without me immediately realizing.

Negative 2556 pIve created a simple flow that exposes an HTTP endpoint linked to a REST service. The REST service returns a String which is then placed onto a JMS queue using the requestresponse pattern. The idea is that the String placed on the queue will be consumed by some consumer and a reponse will created using the ReplyTo address. So basically this is implimenting synchronous JMS.p  pThe flow works as expected, except when the HTTP endpoint is secured using Basic Authentication. In this case the response isp  precodejava.io.NotSerializableException com.sun.jersey.spi.container.ContainerResponse org.apache.commons.lang.SerializationException. Message payload is of type MuleResponseWriter1 codepre  pand no message is placed on the queue. Removing Basic Authentication results in no exception being thrown. Also, removing the JMS outbound endpoint results in the String being echoed back which leads me to believe the problem is with the JMS endpoint. I suspect that the problem is with the response from the JMS endpoint because setting component in the flow to oneway negates the problem. I think the issue might be that the endpoint is sending some response to the HTTP endpoint without authentication credentials and it fails because of it, but Im unsure how to deal with this.p  pBelow is the flow that I createdp  precodeltmule     xmlnsscriptinghttpwww.mulesoft.orgschemamulescripting     xmlnscontexthttpwww.springframework.orgschemacontext xmlnshttpwww.mulesoft.orgschemamulecore     xmlnshttphttpwww.mulesoft.orgschemamulehttp xmlnsjmshttpwww.mulesoft.orgschemamulejms     xmlnsjerseyhttpwww.mulesoft.orgschemamulejersey     xmlnsdochttpwww.mulesoft.orgschemamuledocumentation     xmlnsspringhttpwww.springframework.orgschemabeans xmlnscorehttpwww.mulesoft.orgschemamulecore     versionCE3.3.0 xmlnsxsihttpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchemainstance     xmlnsmulesshttpwww.mulesoft.orgschemamulespringsecurity     xmlnsjsonhttpwww.mulesoft.orgschemamulejson     xmlnssshttpwww.springframework.orgschemasecurity xsischemaLocation     httpwww.mulesoft.orgschemamulehttp httpwww.mulesoft.orgschemamulehttpcurrentmulehttp.xsd      httpwww.mulesoft.orgschemamulejms httpwww.mulesoft.orgschemamulejmscurrentmulejms.xsd      httpwww.mulesoft.orgschemamulejersey httpwww.mulesoft.orgschemamulejerseycurrentmulejersey.xsd      httpwww.springframework.orgschemabeans httpwww.springframework.orgschemabeansspringbeanscurrent.xsd      httpwww.mulesoft.orgschemamulecore httpwww.mulesoft.orgschemamulecorecurrentmule.xsd      httpwww.mulesoft.orgschemamulescripting httpwww.mulesoft.orgschemamulescriptingcurrentmulescripting.xsd      httpwww.mulesoft.orgschemamulespringsecurity httpwww.mulesoft.orgschemamulespringsecurity3.1mulespringsecurity.xsd      httpwww.mulesoft.orgschemamulejson httpwww.mulesoft.orgschemamulejsoncurrentmulejson.xsd      httpwww.springframework.orgschemasecurity httpwww.springframework.orgschemasecurityspringsecurity3.0.xsd gt ltjmsactivemqconnector nameActiveMQ specification1.1 brokerURLtcplocalhost61616                         validateConnectionstrue docnameActive MQgt ltmulesssecuritymanagergt     ltmulessdelegatesecurityprovider namememoryprovider delegaterefauthenticationManagergt ltmulesssecuritymanagergt ltspringbeansgt     ltssauthenticationmanager aliasauthenticationManagergt         ltssauthenticationprovidergt             ltssuserservice iduserServicegt                 ltssuser nameusername passwordpassword authoritiesROLEADMINgt             ltssuserservicegt         ltssauthenticationprovidergt     ltssauthenticationmanagergt ltspringbeansgt ltflow nameRESTAPISync docnameRESTAPISyncgt     lthttpinboundendpoint exchangepatternrequestresponse hostlocalhost port8081 docnameHTTPgt         ltmulesshttpsecurityfilter realmrealmgt     lthttpinboundendpointgt     ltjerseyresources docnameRESTgt         ltcomponent classSFRESTgt     ltjerseyresourcesgt     ltjmsoutboundendpoint exchangepatternrequestresponse queuetmp connectorrefActiveMQ                            docnameJMSgt ltflowgt codepre  pp  pThe SFREST.java componentp  precodeimport javax.ws.rs.GET import javax.ws.rs.Path   Pathpops public class SFREST      GET     public String getPOPs  throws Exception         return hello        codepre  pAnd the exceptionp  precodeERROR 20121104 214057,485 [[jmstest].connector.http.mule.default.receiver.02] org.mule.exception.DefaultMessagingExceptionStrategy  Message                Authentication Attempt Failed.

Im interested in doing validation on the input to the edittextpreference.

The text preference will take in any numbers, but I need to validate this before setting.p  pIm overriding the setText method, and trying to do validation there before actually setting the value. SetText only passes in the text string, how do I know what I am trying to validate How can I get that information In other words, Id like to reuse my class to validate all of my text preferences, and Id like something in the preference itself to tell me what type it is, or what its range is.p

Negative 2556 pI have a web applications A.war which has two servlets codeAServletcode and codeBServletcode. Both instantiate a helper class codecom.mycompany.Foo.classcode this is my own class, not a third party library.  p  pNow I want to split the two servlets into two separate WARs A.war will have only AServlet and anew B.war will have codeBServletcode. codeAServletcode will invoke codeBServletcode via HTTP GET. Both WARs will have codecom.mycompany.Foo.classcode. I want to deploy both WARs on the same JBoss instance.  p  pThe question is, will there be any classloading issues due to the same class being present in both WARs, and the WARs being deployed on the same JBoss instancep

Negative 2556 pI am trying to read a largish 1 MB svg file that is exported from an old program.  I do not have access to this program or the data.  I only have this exported svg file and I will probably have to import a freshly exported svg file somewhat regularly from this source.  The first problem I find using batik is that it is very strict when reading this file.  Firefox has no problem reading and displaying this file for example.  Batik including Squiggle can not display it because of some custom tags within the document.

Negative 2556 pWe developed a site using JSF 2 running on jBoss EAP 6.0, we are having problems in our production environment that basically after a period of time with current levels of users about 24 hrs the application makes the server load average go up to 100 and the server kind of stops responding it actually doesnt stop responding it just takes too long to response so in practicall terms its the samep  pNow if we just stop and start jBoss again the application works fine so its not a problem of load but more something that happens over time, the more load the faster it happens p  pIn order to test this we created a simple application just a war that basically has a login page, and s very simple page that renders some text with a button and a simple popup that also just renders some text.p  pWe are using jMeter  running in another machine to stress this simple application hitting it with 100 concurrent threads or as concurrent as jMeter allows anyway. The jBoss EAP running on a Mac with i5 and 8gb of ram using 4gb for the server lasts around 20 minutes before escalating load average to 50 and continus climbing, If instead of 100 I use 200 threads p  pThe other thing I noticed is that If I start testing with a fresh jBoss instance it takes X amount of time for the load average to escalate, now, If I start a test, get the load average up to say 50, then stop that test and start a new test without restarting jBoss the Load Average spikes in seconds to a 50 again.p  pWe can stress our services using the Restful services without problems and no load average spikes so we are guessing that its not a general jBoss issue but more of a JSF issue. p  pIm uploading some images of Visual VM as a reference where you can see that GC is done periodically and looks fine and the curb of both CPU and load average escalation and the contents of the pom.xml for library versions.p  pSo my questions are basically has anyone encountered this problem is this normal behaviour can anyone think of a reason for this happening we have also created a ticket with RedHat support but we are hopping that someone in the community had already faced this issue or could help us figure out a way to find out whts happeningp  pI can provide the code of the sample application and the jMeter test script if anyone is interested p  pTIAp  pLoad average

The question is this how to escape the file path correctly.  I havent found a way to do this to make it work.p  pI have searched on this site and the general interweb and have learned I think that there are two levels of script interpretation going on  VBscript and the Wscript.

However, the error message points to an unrecognized argument caPRDBSet  that is, it does not emseeem the whole path CaPRDBSet UpSimpleInsert.PS1.  It appears that the escaping of the quotes or something is not working... better said, I am not doing it correctly.p  pAny thoughtful advice would be greatly appreciated.

Negative 2556 pIve got a situation where my input data looks something like the following.p  precodeAA1 AA2 AA3 AA4 BB1 BB2 BB3 CC1 CC2 CC3 CC4 CC5 CC6 codepre  pWhat I want to do is split the data up into InputSplits where each split covers a section of the strings that begin with certain leading letters. For example the 1st input split would be all strings that start with AA, the 2nd split would be those that start with BB, etc. p  pI want to do it this way because my data needs to be together like that in order for the reduce phase to correctly operate. p  pWhat Ive been playing around with so far is writing my own codeInputFormatcode and codeRecordReadercode classes to do this, however I see in some examples httpdeveloper.yahoo.comhadooptutorialmodule5.htmlfileformat that the splits are already created by the time the reader gets to them. I believe that I run into danger of having splits not align correctly with the boundaries between strings. p  pIn order to make this work fully, do I have to implement my own version of codeInputFormatcode codegetSplitscode function If I do this, do I run a risk of distributing my splits across machines in a fashion that does not take advantage of machine locality Finally, is there a better way to this in generalp  pAny help is appreciated. Thanks,p  pmjp  pEDIT 0p  pIm including more information per the request of several commentators. p  pThe objective of my program is to compare strings that belong in groups to find the overlap between those strings and record which strings together share that overlap. Consider the following example. p  precodeAAAA AAAB AAAC AAB BAAA codepre  pAll the strings that share an A at the beginning have some overlap that is common between them. The one that starts with B obviously doesnt. When it comes to actually discovering what the specific overlap is, and building those groups, if Im looking at AAAA,  I need to compare all the way down to BAAA and no further. My concern is that the InputSplits will chop up my data such that certain strings wont be compared against and I will have missingincomplete groups. I was hoping to use the Map step or reading of data to split the problem into these groups and then allow the Reduce step to calculate the groups and return results. p  pIve got millions of strings like this and it takes a while on a single machine. Ive logically implemented a ton of tricks to streamline the process and make it run fast. I was hoping Hadoop could step in and help and make it even faster. p  pJoe K  to answer your question, I dont know the extent of the overlap between all strings. Overlap can differ, for example AA1 can overlap 2 characters all the way through AA4, but if AB5 were present, only 1 character would overlap. The strings can vary in length greatly so you may get huge overlap in other instances. Also, detecting what exactly the overlap is is what I wanted to do in the reduce phase. Thats what my whole objective was. p  pI dont know if the shufflesort phase will correctly distribute the adjacent strings to the same reducer or if there will be breaks. My ignorance of the process unfortunately is tripping me up here. p  pEDIT 0 ENDp
Negative 2556 pI am unable to propagate exceptions through dlsym. I use dlsym to load a cythonized python file. I made a minimal working example below so you can try it yourselfp  pI have a pyx file, cfun.pyx, which I compile to a C file using Cython. Then Im using dlsym to load in the so file in another program, say usefun.c. You can use .compile.sh  to compile the files. On executing .test, the program crashes with a segmentation fault.p  precodecfun.pyx cdef public double myfunctiondouble x except     a10           This does not propagate an exception. Comment to make the example work     return x2x   This works.  usefun.c include ltdlfcn.hgt include ltstdio.hgt  int mainint argc, char argv      void handle  dlopen.cfun.so, RTLDNOW  RTLDGLOBAL     ifhandleNULL          printfs nat line number in,dlerror,LINE return           double fdouble  double doubledlsymhandle, myfunction     iffNULL          printfsn,dlerror return           double res  0     try          res  fdouble99      catchchar err          printfGot exception s.n, err          printfres  fn, res   setup.py from distutils.core import setup from distutils.extension import Extension from Cython.Distutils import buildext  extmodules  [Extensioncfun, [cfun.pyx], libraries  [python2.7], extracompileargs [fexceptions]]  setup   name  Hello world app, cmdclass  buildext buildext, extmodules  extmodules    compile.sh python setup.py buildext inplace echo gcc usefun.c g O0 o test ldl g usefun.c g O0 o test ldl codepre  pInitially, I tried without the except at the end of my function, and without the fexceptions compiler flag. But adding those do not change the behavior. gdb doesnt even allow me to backtrace the problem, and says Cannot find new threads generic error . I have looked on the internet for exception handling in combination with dlsym, but have found little information.p  pThe rest of the story To make it more complicated, actually this usefun.c file is a Python module which I imported. So Im using Python to load in a the module usefun, and in that C module, myfunction is called. But also then, I cannot get the exception handling right. However, in that case, I did successfully use gdb to get into the C code and see that PyErrFormat was successfully called. But the error is not triggered nor caught in the C code.p  pNote that to be able to expose the file myfunction, I have specified the public keyword in the pyx file. Without it, the name mangling would cause the dlsym function call to fail. I tried looking for documentation on these two links p  pa hrefhttpdocs.cython.orgsrcuserguideexternalCcode.htmlusingcythondeclarationsfromc relnofollowhttpdocs.cython.orgsrcuserguideexternalCcode.htmlusingcythondeclarationsfromcap  pa hrefhttpdocs.cython.orgsrcuserguidelanguagebasics.htmlerrorreturnvalues relnofollowhttpdocs.cython.orgsrcuserguidelanguagebasics.htmlerrorreturnvaluesap  pEdit I have found the solution. Ill keep the original question above so it can help others. There were essentially 2 problemsp  p1 Of course, since C does not have exceptions, it was wrong to set a trycatch over the function What does work, is checking whether an error occurred in Python using PyErrOccurred.p  p2 Since cython generates a module, it has to be initialized before you can properly use it. This means calling PyInitializePyFinalize, and also calling the initcfun method.p  pThe solution is shown belowp  precodeinclude Python.h include ltdlfcn.hgt include ltstdio.hgt  int mainint argc, char argv      PyInitialize     void handle  dlopen.cfun.so, RTLDNOW  RTLDGLOBAL     ifhandleNULL          printfs nat line number in,dlerror,LINE return 1          void initfunc     voidampinitfunc  dlsymhandle, initcfun     initfunc      double fdouble  double doubledlsymhandle, myfunction     iffNULL          printfsn,dlerror return 1           double res  0     res  fdouble99     ifPyErrOccurred          PyErrPrint          printfres  fn, res     PyFinalize     return 0  codepre

How meaningful is this 4 byte address I do not want to change destination type. because problem will be recursive warnings.p

Negative 2556 pWhen Im developing Python code, I usually test it in an adhoc way in the interpreter. Ill codeimport somemodulecode, test it, find a bug, fix the bug and save, and then use the builtin codereloadcode function to codereloadsomemodulecode and test again.p  pHowever, suppose that in codesomemodulecode I have codeimport someothermodulecode, and while testing codesomemodulecode I discover a bug in codesomeothermodulecode and fix it. Now calling codereloadsomemodulecode wont recursively reimport codesomeothermodulecode. I have to either manually reimport the dependency by doing something like codereloadsomemodule.someothermodulecode, or codeimport someothermodule reloadsomeothermodulecode, or, if Ive changed a whole bunch of dependencies and lost track of what I need to reload, I need to restart the entire interpreter.p  pWhatd be more convenient is if there were some coderecursivereloadcode function, and I could just do coderecursivereloadsomemodulecode and have Python not only reload codesomemodulecode, but also recursively reload every module that codesomemodulecode imports and every module that each of those modules imports, and so on so that I could be sure that I wasnt using an old version of any of the other modules upon which codesomemodulecode depends.p  pI dont think theres anything built in to Python that behaves like the coderecursivereloadcode function I describe here, but is there an easy way to hack such a thing togetherp

Negative 2556 pGreetings.br I have a Roo generated web app. I want to test my controller. So am using springtest3.2.br     Using STS 3.2.br  Embedded Derby for testing.br     The test suite fails when the controller test is wedged between two integration tests  breaks the integration test following it. If I Ignore the controller test, suite runs fine. This integration test has both Roo generated and my own test methods.br     I searched around a lot  but cannot reason for this behaviour. I suspected Transactions not rolling back correctly, but that seems all fine logs are fine.      I just have just one empty controller test method. I think for some reason my ContextConfiguration is the issue...p  pIntegration test before  p  precodeRunWithSpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class ContextConfigurationlocations  classpathMETAINFspring applicationContext.xml Transactional public class CompanyServiceImplTest  codepre  pController Test  p  precodeRunWithSpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class WebAppConfiguration ContextConfigurationvalue       filesrcmainresourcesMETAINFsprinapplicationContext.xml,     filesrcmainwebappWEBINFspringwebmvcconfig.xml  Transactional codepre  pIntegration test after This breaks  p  precodeRunWithSpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class ContextConfigurationlocations  classpathMETAINFspringapplicationContext.xml Transactional RooIntegrationTestentity  Status.class public class StatusIntegrationTest    codepre  pWould be grateful for any pointers...   p  p cheerio atulp

Negative 2556 pI have an odd thing happening with importing data from Excel to SQL Server using the Import and Export Data tool.p  pThe short of it is that I can see the data in Excel, but all of the data doesnt import.p  pI have an excel workbook containing one spreadsheet.  I can see the data in the columns and everything looks good.  When I use the import wizard to import the data, I can see the columns and the preview data, but the data doesnt all get transferred over when the import is executed.  There are no errors and the import process finishes  it just inserts a bunch of null values into the table.p  pIt seems to happen most with numbers  so lets say I have three columns for first name, last name, and ID number.   Ill get all of the first and last names, and some of the ID numbers.  I cant find a pattern for whats happening.p  pI had this happen once before and I noticed that there were two spreadsheets to choose from during the import process  DataImport and DataImport  and the first one would fail as described above and the second one would import flawlessly.  This time there is only one spreadsheet to select.  p  pIm mainly using an XLS document and the 32bit import wizard on a 64bit system, but Im willing to try anything.p  pAny ideas of why there are two spreadsheets sometimes and why this import would failp  pDavep

Negative 2556 pI am running into an issue that a long URL will throw a System.IO.PathTooLongException. This is somewhat strange because a System.IO.PathTooLongException is actually for physical files, it is not related to URLs. p  pAs an example, I have a URL that looks like the following  p  precodeproductsforsale.mvcsearchterm1somethingprice10001500searchterm3etcetc  codepre  pBasically with the search terms bloating out the URL. We also allow a keyword search which can get kinda big if the user is looking for something specific. As a side note, the .mvc on the URL is a hangover of the application from when it ran on IIS6 and extensionless URLs were not supported, but it shouldnt really be an issue here. p  pWhat I believe the issue is, is that it looks for a physical file using the URL. I could be wrong, but I think that is the issue. Almost every article about PathTooLongExceptions revolve around actual files, not URLs being too long. p  pI had an inkling that within the IIS handler mappings, I could switch off to check if a physical file exists I think this was a setting in IIS6, but in IIS7 under request restrictions of a handler mapping, it only has Invoke handler only if request is mapped to and then filefolderfile or folder. This is NOT ticked for .mvc in IIS, and there is no where else that I have found to try and say please dont look for a physical file if using this extension. p  pI could be way off base with my guesses on how to fix the issue.p

Negative 2556 pI am using the Akka framework together with jMonkeyEngine jME3 for my little scalajava game. By adapting some a hrefhttpsgist.github.comerwink2941554 relnofollowAkka dispatcher magica I managed to run a dedicated actor in the same thread as jME3s main loop thread. For the actor to have access to the protected variables of class SimpleApplication which one should extend to create a game with jME3, I figured it would be neat to create a class which would inherit emclass SimpleApplicationem and mix in emtrait Actorem. Something like thisp  precodeJmeActor extends SimpleApplication with Actor codepre  pThe problem is that both SimpleApplication and Actor have a emcontextem variable which clash together. For the time being, I have renamed SimpleApplications emcontextem variable to emjmeContextem and recompiled jME3. The result works pretty well, but the very design seems broken to me, since any further release of jME3 or Akka even will require that I go over this refactoring manually once again. It may even be possible, although perhaps unlikely, that SimpleApplication is modified further by the development team making this clash avoidance technique much harder.p  pCan anyone see a simple solution to this p

Negative 2556 pWhat I would like to make is a bar with growing animation and the textnumber also growing with the value of bar length.

And the user may be want to play the animation again by tap Replay.p  pAfter read apple programming guide and some great tutorials, I have a general idea. With Quartz2d, I could draw the bar and also the vertical line, and also the text as well. But Quartz2d does not have animation effect. With Core Animation, I could change the shape of the bar by time and specified properties value. Am I right on this p  pSo I guess what I want is combine Quartz2d and Core Animation, draw the bar with Quartz2d first and then use CA to animate it Is it the correct way to do this Or if any other lightweight solution available, I will greatly appreciate.p  pPS Im very new to iPhone drawing, as far as I know, the lightest way to do animation is by UIView animation, and the lighter one is by CALayer animation. And the whole drawing work is by Quartz2d, am I correct Its kind of confusing even after I read a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1877987whatsthedifferencebetweenquartzcorecoregraphicsandquartz2dthis posta. But to be practical, I do not or not able to get too conceptual about the whole graphic system. But I will definitely keep digging after write some actual code about this. p  pSo, right now, I just need to know if this is the best way to realize this animation effect.p  pThanks guys  p

Negative 2556 pI am new to Arduino and I have 2 issues when I tried the BluetoothShieldDemo.p  ol lipI can only send data from bluetooth modulethrough serial monitor to phone but I cannot send from phone to bluetooth moduleto display it in serial monitor.

Then I change the code to use hardware serial Serial1 and it is working now. I just wonder why it is not working with the SoftwareSerial.pli lipAlthough I can send and receive data, I cannot change the bluetooth name. The bluetooth module has no response when the below commands are sent.

Now, that I have that two threads I cant figure out, how to use that one instance and their methods in that two separate threads. I tried different approaches, but nothing did work. So in my opinion I made a mistake in the class design. I mean, I dont just want to get it running thatd be quite easy, but I want to know how to do it correctly. The main problem is actually that I cant access the MyObjects instance and simply use the draw method in the renderer  because I dont get it.p  pI thought, it would be possible to call the draw method of MyObject within the rendering thread without the need of using a singleton and so on. So simply referencing the instance to it. But somehow that seemed weird and dirty besides that it doesnt work for me.

Im quite familar with OOP, but here I might really miss something.p  pIn that many samples I found on the web stackoverflow, Replica Island, different tutorial sites, Google IO, DevCentral, etc. they either didnt use a multithreaded system or they split it directly GL objects from regular objects.p  pAny hint into the right direction would be much appreciatedp

Negative 2556 pI would like to create a mock AR Aug Reality demo using the camera whereby you can move the camera around and see information about the world around you. In the first instance as this would just be an initial demo I thought a sensible approach may be to use a large transparent image and based on the angle of the device a different portion of the image would be shown, so as you would tilt it up the image would move down and a different portion of the image would be shown, and as you would pan left and right the corresponding part of that image would show, appearing like theres an overlay over specific parts of the scene from the camera.p  pMy initial investigation leads me to believe the CMMotionManager class is probably the best to use to handle the device angle position and after which the centre of the image overlay would be altered accordingly.p  pMy question is 2 foldp  ul liIs this a sensible approach for this, or should I look to go with another approach like splitting down to smaller images and popping up based on the device positionli liIs there any example of approaches  code like this that have already been done Including some of the maths that may be involved.li ul  pThanks,p

Negative 2556 pWell, this might be a strange question. But as title says, can you add Grid to ContainerVisual. Since Grid inherits Visual, I should be able to do it via Children.Add.p  pWhy do I need this Well, Im using FlowDocument to print a report. This report needs to have a header, and since Flow Document doesnt support Headers, I decided to add headers during pagination, by using a solution found on the internet.p  pAlso since I dont want to draw entire header by hand but be able to edit it during desing in a designer, I designed it in a separate file as a Grid element.

Negative 2556 pI have a GUI that consists of multiple JList components on a panel, which is on a JScrollPane. The scroll pane makes it possible to scroll all of the lists at once. However, when I use MigLayout on the panel containing the lists I am unable to scroll past the first 1819 list elements. The limitation appears to be related to the height of the list, not the number of elements. If I use larger element sizes I can scroll less elements. Im currently using MigLayout 4.2. p  pHere is a simplified example that exhibits this behavior.p  precodeimport net.miginfocom.swing.MigLayout  import javax.swing. import java.awt.  public final class MigLayoutListTest      public static void mainfinal String... args          SwingUtilities.invokeLaternew Runnable              Override             public void run                  final String[] listData  new String[5000]                 for int i  0 i lt 5000 i                      listData[i]  Index   i                                   final JPanel panel  new JPanelnew MigLayout                 panel.addnew JListlistData                  final JFrame frame  new JFrame                 frame.setContentPanenew JScrollPanepanel                  frame.setDefaultCloseOperationWindowConstants.EXITONCLOSE                 frame.setPreferredSizenew Dimension600, 400                 frame.pack                 frame.setVisibletrue                             codepre  pIf I eliminate the JPanel and put the JList directly on the JScrollPane then scrolling works correctly, but I cannot use this workaround since I need multiple lists on the same JScrollPane. If I use any layout other than MigLayout for the JPanel then scrolling works correctly. p  pIs this a bug or limitation of MigLayout Is there some configuration option that needs to be applied to MigLayout in order to get it working correctlyp
Negative 2556 pIve recently downloaded GPUImage which is made up of one large directory containing the framework and various sample projects within it. Usually when I run a project its simply one folder containing the project and everything works fine. However, when I run one of the sample projects within GPUImage, its not recognizing the provisioning profile. When I move the sample project out of the GPUImage folder on its own, the provisioning profile error goes away, but then I get a bunch of new errors about it not being able to find the framework and other things I messed around with moving stuff around but it turned into a disaster.p  pIm wondering, is there a path somewhere that I need to change to get Xcode to work like normal when running a sample project from within the GPUImage directory so I dont get the provisioning profile error p

And when codebuttonAcode is pressed, this code is firedp  precodeifdelegate ampamp [delegate respondsToSelectorselectorbuttonAPressed]      [delegate buttonAPressed]  codepre  pThis emappearsem to work fine. All the methods are called as expected. strongHere is the problem. When I pop vcB back to vcA, vcB is never released. If vcB is pushed again, then the memory just cycles up. I can repeat this cycling until the app explodes.strongp  pWhen I dont init codeBBViewcode with any delegate variable or a codenilcode value, the codevcBcode memory is released on a navigation pop. But then of course, codevcBcode is never made aware of the button taps.p  pDoes anyone have any idea what could be going on I have been messing with this for a long time now, and I simply cant figure out how to pass in codevcBcode as an object to codeBBViewcode and have it release when the navigation is popped back to codevcAcode.p  pAny pointers would be most helpful.p

Negative 2556 pIm looking for ways to add syntactic sugar to a project, and am considering adding an codeAliascode class, that is a bit reminiscent of codetypedefcode in C, with significant differences.

Negative 2556 pI was wondering if it was possible to execute jobs via ssh.  In particular I have a different list of input files on a number of machines that all have the same executable in the same place.

Negative 2556 pI need to merge multple XML documents based on paragraph ids as described below. Basically, it is a document synchronization situation, where paragprahs added to the master document need to be added from the secondary documents paragraphs removed from the master must be removed the secondary documents, and, finally, some attributes e.g. font on master document paragraph nodes must be duplicated to the secondary doc while some need to be preserved e.g. author.  I have written some rather brute force ugly the code in c .net, it semi  works havent coded attribute handling keepupdate logic but would much prefer an XSLT solution, as it seems like a perfect application for XSLT, but I am an XSLT virgin thrown into a new rush project...

Negative 2556 pIt should be trivial, but after some chating on laravel irc channel, I found it may be impossible for now.

It uses Laravel codeLangcode everywhere to get strings in one of the 8 bundled languages of the package. But I need to override some of those strings, and I dont want to modify the package files which would defeat the whole purpose of Composer.

Negative 2556 pIn our application we have a codePostDeleteEventListenercode registered that is executed for each deleted owning entity and possibly for related entities if cascading delete is enabled. The listener is used to inspect each entity for a certain property that represents the ID of an entity that is located in one big centralised table without foreign key relation. The discovered IDs are stored in a codejava.util.Setcode held by a codeThreadLocalcode.p  pWhat were looking for is some transaction hook to trigger one delete statement for performance reasons with all the IDs held by the codejava.util.Setcode.p  pWe tried to achieve this by using a Spring aspect that is executed after a codeTransactionalcode method has run. The aspect could then fire the delete statement and clear the java.util.Set. Unfortunately, it seems that the codePostDeleteEventListenercode is executed AFTER the aspect is triggered. In other words, it gets executed in a separate transaction which I can clearly see by inspecting the stacktrace while debugging. So having an aspect for this doesnt look the way to go...p  pAn other option seems to have a second listener codeFlushEventListenercode that is executed when the session is flushed. Although this works, we dont know if this is a good solutionp  pAre there any other and better alternatives out there we can use for this issue Is there an other way Spring or Hibernate to get notified just before the transaction is committedp

And use a loop to create the sum amp counts, without having to declare each output column.  I would be okay to just sum and count every column and just print which columns that I need. I ran into difficulty trying to code this in Perl using hashesarrays.  I attempted to use a hashs but then couldnt get the output format, so I am not sure if this is how i want to structure the data.p  precodenarray[base]Adultcount array[21] eq 0  0  1 narray[base]Childcount array[21] eq 1  0  1 narray[base]Weightsum  array[21] narray[base]Agesum array[34] codepre  pEdit I think my logical problem is that I do not want to call out the field namecolumn.  Because I want to perform the sum amp count over many fields.  The Adult Child comparison was just an example.  I would just like to list the columns that I want to work with in 1 place.  Maybe the simple way to explain it is, lets say there are 100 columns from the input data.  I want to be able to flexibly identify the columns that I want to analyze.  For example columns 1530 I want to take the sum amp count of each column based on a unique value in column 1.  Then be able to modify that same code to take a sum for columns 1520 amp 3040.  Using AWK I can call out the columns thatI want to work with 2,3,4,... but it becomes difficult to manage when there are too many columns.p

If user 3 who has no boards logs in, he is greeted with create board so I presume it works as there are no rows of data associated with that user. However, if user 1 logs in has 2 boards only the second board name is being displayed. If I remove the mysqlifetchrow code then both board names are outputted. Obviously the fetchrow is effecting the results but I cant work out why.p  pIf anyone can offer any guidance in how to check if a user has any boards I would be very grateful. Also if anyone can explain for my own personal development why running fetchrow alters my result set that is passed to the while loop it would be a bonus.p  pThanks in advancep
Negative 2556 pIm trying to write an Android app java that does things like determine battery usage by app, cpu usage by app, memory usage by app, and then overall things like battery level, cpu voltage, battery temp, cpu temp, etc.  Basically a bunch of statistics which may later be used for analysis.  After reading into how this might be done, it seemed to me like the best way to go about this would be to make use of proc.  Specifically, procapm for battery things, proccpuinfo for cpu speed, procmeminfo for memory fields, and procstat for cpu usage.  To get app specific data, would you follow proc with the PIDs, maybe in a loop  For instance to pseudo code it, it would be like thisp  precodeGet PIDs of all running processes Run a loop that reads info from procltPIDgtapm and saves pertinent data to an array,           then iterates the PID Run loops like the one above for cpuinfo, meminfo, and stat codepre  pI currently read battery level just fine, and CPU usage took me a while but I think I have that too.  Its app specific stuff that is getting me into trouble.  Would I need root access for any of the statistics that I mentionedp  pThank you so muchp

Negative 2556 pI am banging my head with this for quite a while now exploring on you tube and stackoverflow for similar situations to find a solution to this issue with no luck whatsoever, so I hope someone can help if I ask directly...p  pNow to explain my issue...I have a php page that has a select field aswell as a text field which are supposed to interract between themselves using the combination of javascript and PHP. Now the select field has a list of countries which I get the value from with this codep  pcodevar select  select[namefromcountry] optionselected.textcodep  pwhere codefromcountrycode is the name of the select field.p  pThe text field on the other hand triggers from a keydown anonimous jquery function which then is supposed to use the select variable value to pass it via an ajax call to a PHP function which then on its end should from the selected country value find a txt file with the appropriate name of the country and contains a list of its cities and put it into an array which then should be returned back to the javascript function that made the ajax call and populate a variable called availableTags which is used by a remote function that autocomplets the text field with the appropriate names of the selected country.p  pNow my issue here is that if I try this only with javascript and put the availableTags variable equal to a function in that same function which gets the values all listed in that function as an array it works fine, but is very ugly code and I want to clean it up by using an ajax call to fetch those notepad files with php and then return them back in an array which would be encapsulated into the avaialbleTags variable.p  pHere is how the code looks like after my last attempts to solve the issuesp  pjavascript filep  precodedocument.readyfunction      tag .keydownfunction   here needs to come code that checks which country is selected and fetch an appropriate array of cities corresponding to the selected countryyou will need to send an ajax request to a PHP file which will check the country and fetch the appropriate external file with tags to be used as an array to be used in the autocomplete function below          var select  select[namefromcountry] optionselected.text      var availableTags  .ajax                         url findcitiesbycountry.php,                         data countrytofind  select,                         dataType json,                         success functiondata                                  return data                                                           the autocomplete is the external function          tag .autocomplete             source availableTags                        tags .autocomplete             source  availableTags                      codepre  pPHP filep  precodecountrytofind  POST [countrytofind]  ifemptycountrytofind   reads the file with the name of the value passed from the javascript function and then appends its contents to the data[] array in the while loop         filetoread  countrytofind..txt      fh  fopen filetoread, r      whilefeoffh                      data[] . fgetsfh.ltbrgt                  fclosefh  jsonencode should pass the data as an array to the javascript function that made the ajax call to this function       echo jsonencodedata      codepre  pIf I forgot to add some relevant information to help you answer my question, please let me know, thx.p

Negative 2556 pOk, so I have, what seems to me like a very weird issue. I have a Postgres table created with the following SQLp  precodeCREATE TABLE message    message text,   author integer,   thread integer,   id serial NOT NULL,   createdAt timestamp with time zone,   updatedAt timestamp with time zone,   CONSTRAINT messagepkey PRIMARY KEY id  WITH    OIDSFALSE    ALTER TABLE message   OWNER TO glenselle codepre  pIm using Sails.js which uses Waterline ORM to save a message model to the database. Mind you, in the process of trying to isolate the problem I began dropping the table every time I try saved a new record and the behavior is always the same. The ORM is doing some associations for me to associate the author with a user model and the thread with a thread model. Anyway, when I attempt to save a record, I first get thisp  precodeERROR  duplicate key value violates unique constraint messagepkey DETAIL  Key id1 already exists. STATEMENT  INSERT INTO message message, author, thread, id, createdAt, updatedAt values 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 RETURNING  codepre  pSo this should be really easy to understand. Theres already a row in the table with an id of 1 which is why the messagepkey constraint is violated. But the ironic thing is that there is no data So my question is this, what could be happening that causes Postgres to throw a unique constraint violation if the table has absolutely no data in it it was just dropped and recreated it with the SQL I posted abovep  pHeres what Im running to create the modelp  precodecreate functionreq, res      var self  this      Thread.create, functionerr, newThread          iferr return console.logerr          Message.createmessage req.body.conversation[0].message, functionerr, newMessage              iferr return console.logerr              This returns an array of user ids             sails.controllers.thread.parseUserIdsreq.body.participants, req.user, functionidList                    First, associate the message with the author                 newMessage.author  req.user.id                 newMessage.savefunctionerr, savedMessage                      iferr return console.logerr                       First, associate the participants with the thread                     newThread.participants.addidList                       Next, associate the message with the thread                     newThread.conversation.addsavedMessage                      newThread.savefunctionerr, savedThread                          iferr return console.logerr                          console.logThe thread looks to have been saved.

Negative 2556 pI have a puzzling problem here. I have a django application to view live data from a data acquisition software remotely. Basically, the software provides a script that inserts live data to the database MySQL. From the web page I can see this live data thanks to flot JavaScript. p  pThere are two ways to visualize data if the data is being produced on the fly or if it is stored in the database. There is no differences, the queries to the database are the same for both cases. But while I am watching the data on the fly, the queries of data accumulates a delay proportional to the size of the table. I dont know if the problem comes because in one case on the fly the data is being inserted at the same time I make the queries, so the table is growing with the time. p  pBecause of that, I decided to migrate from MyISAM table to InnoDB ALTER TABLE mytable ENGINEInnoDB, because I have heard that InnoDB is optimized for reading and writing at the same time. This table of data is very large, because of the big amount of data. Now, this table has about 6 millions of rows. So, I converted the table to InnoDB. And now, the problem is worse, because I have slow queries about 5 seconds in both cases on the fly and when there is no inserted data. p  pI have heard a lot of optimization tools but I dont understand so much about MySQL. What about primary keys to optimize the search How this worksp  pPlease, I need to solve this. I would appreciate any help received. p  pThanks in advance. p

Negative 2556 pI have an Android app that I have been able to successfully build with Gradle using Gradle 0.7.  Now I want to set up Gradle to build two separate .APKs, one which had only ARM native libraries and the other with only Intel x86 native libraries.  I have tried using productFlavors as in the following examplebr a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions20674650howtoconfigurendkwithandroidgradleplugin07How to configure NDK with Android Gradle plugin 0.7abr However, with productFlavors specified in my Gradle script, the .APKs dont include any libraries at all the libs dir itself is not in the .APK.  Without productFlavors, the libraries are included  although the resulting APK will contain both ARM and x86 libraries.p  pWith Gradle, it seems that our libraries are being placed in the following directories buildjavaResourcesreleaselibarmeabiv7abr buildjavaResourcesreleaselibx86br buildjavaResourcesdebuglibarmeabiv7abr buildjavaResourcesdebuglibx86br Without productFlavors in the Gradle script, Gradle seems to know to look in those directories for the libraries.  So Im at a loss as to whats going on.  Why would the inclusion of productFlavors prevent Gradle from looking there for the librariesp

Negative 2556 pThank you all for you help I received some phenomenal help about 17 days ago which saved my emem. I am still learning PHP and have run across a new problem. I have a MYSQL database field called Tracking this is a long text field in which we want to input tracking numbers for shipping separated by commas . We ship some times 2050 individual boxes in the same order.p  pThe following script outputs to an HTML table the number of boxes being shipped EX Box 1 of 12, Box 2 of 12...etc and then the value of the tracking number field. I need to modify it so it parses at the comma in the Tracking field and includes the tracking number for each box. So Box 1 Tracking Number take first tracking number and end at comma, So Box 2 Tracking Number take second tracking number and end at comma....etc...does this make sensep  pPlease provide whatever help possible, would greatly be appreciatedp  pScriptp  precode    ltphp q  intvalGET[q]  con  mysqliconnect,,, if con  dieCould not connect  . mysqlierrorcon   mysqliselectdbcon,db116223wmi sqlSELECT  FROM tblpurchaseorder WHERE purchaseorderid  .q. result  mysqliquerycon,sql    whilerow  mysqlifetcharrayresult  for i0 iltrow[productquantity] i  myval1 x  1  echo lttablegt  echo lttrgt  echo  lttd width400gtltbrgtBox x of . row[productquantity] .

Now I want a viewer that shows me if the sensor is working or not. For example sensor node is green or red.p  pWhat I have I have a softSPS program on CoDeSys with the variable isWorking. With JEasyOPC I can readoverwrite this variable and print it into Eclipse console. I also created a Sirius model for my system in an eclipse runtime as in all Sirius tutorials I found are shown. I saw that I can change the color of node with a Conditional Style.p  pSo I have a node Sensor and a variable isWorking but I dont know how to connect them.p  pI found something about external Java action in Sirius documenation. Theres also in Sirius Forum an example a hrefhttpswww.eclipse.orgforumsindex.phpt764175 relnofollowhttpswww.eclipse.orgforumsindex.phpt764175a but I dont know if its work for my problem and how i can use JEasyOPC with them.p  pAnother way I found is JFace Data Binding but I only found a tutorial that works with an EMF Model and not with a Sirius Diagram a hrefhttpwww.vogella.comtutorialsEclipseDataBindingEMFarticle.html relnofollowhttpwww.vogella.comtutorialsEclipseDataBindingEMFarticle.htmla.

Negative 2556 pIm trying to build a function in which an argument is a reference to a vector of objects. In this case name of the object is obj, it is an instance of the class Example and it is a vector as defined in vector class.

I googled it and saw that it is related to operator overloading and usage of references. The solution is probably related to dereferencing my object reference inside of the function, but I wasnt able to manage this one right currently.p  pAnd the second error is outside of the function, inside the main at the line where I call the function No matching function for call to calculate.  Here, I assume the error is related to the fact that obj is not just an object but a vector of objects, so I should change the argument somehow. But I havent been able to correct this one up to now as well.p  pSo, to summarize, I want to pass a vector of objects to a function as reference, because I want to be able to change a member of the object inside of the function.p  pThank you in advance.p

Negative 2556 pComing across an issue in iOS 8 Safari where I cant select or copy text.

Negative 2556 pI am trying to play video on an Android device from the memory. In the sense my files are encrypted and stored in SD card so to play these files I cannot decrypt the files and store on SD card  because of security issues as anyone can access the SD card and get the decrypted file. So I have to decrypt the file chunk by chunk and feed the data to the VideoView  in Android. So my task is to play the media files by decrypting it on the fly i.e. in memory decryption and streaming like concept.p  pSo for this I had set up a HTTPServer with the help of NanoHTTPD server and convert the file datapath to url type by using and feeding it to the VideoView. and the server decrypts and does buffering of Video files. Everything work like charm but when I do seeking backward i.e. seeking back to the current position of the video being played I get Unspecified media file error and the VideoView hangs. So can any one please help me on how to make a streaming media server that can be seekable backward too.p  pAny help is appreciated. As from two weeks I am stuck in seeking the file backward while streaming using HTTP server.p

Negative 2556 pI have a tab bar based app. There are navigation controllers in all 5 tabs with instances of custom view controller setup properly as root view controllers. This loads just fine. A couple of these view controllers contain table views. I want to show a modal view controller to the user when they select a row in the table view. The relevant part of didSelectRowAtIndexPath delegate method looks as followsp  precodeSampleSelectorViewController sampleVC  [[SampleSelectorViewController alloc] init] [self presentViewControllersampleVC animatedYES completionNULL] codepre  pThe modal view controller appears BUT it appears after a very noticeable delay. At times it even requires the user to tap the row a second time. A few things that I have already verified arep  ul liTable views didSelectRowAtIndexPath method is called when the user taps the rowli liThe didSelectRowAtIndexPath method does not contain any blocking calls. There are no network operations being performed and the modal view controllers setup does not involve any processing intensive task.

It is only when presented modally that the delay is encountered.li ul  pAny ideassuggestionsp

Negative 2556 pI am fully aware that Swift doesnt have a trycatch mechanism to catch exceptions OK, Swift 2.0 now supports them. I also understand that many API methods return a NSError that will be filled with an error object if something goes wrong. So please dont point me to this question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions24010569errorhandlinginswiftlanguageErrorHandling in SwiftLanguageap  pBut this still doesnt explain how to react to runtime errors in your own code, like arrayoutofbounds accesses or forceunwrapping an optional value that is nil. For examplep  precodevar test String test  nil printlntest oops codepre  porp  precodevar arr  [0,1,2] for i  0...3      printlnarr[i] oops  codepre  pEvery programmer makes such mistakes occasionally and there should be a way to at least log them for later analysis. While debugging, Xcode can show us those, but what if this happens to an enduser or betatester In pure C there is signal handling and it could be used in ObjectiveC as well. Is there something like this in Swift A centralized callback entered just before the app diesp  pUpdatep  pLet me rephrase the question in a large project, it is not feasible to manually check for the above errors on every loop and forceunwrapping. When a runtime error does happen eventually, is there a callback like Objective Cs segfault handling or NSSetUncaughtExceptionHandler that will get called so that the error can be loggedemailed together with a stacktrace of the crashp

Negative 2556 pIm using MakBox for iOS 1.4.1 SDK in my iPhone app with Objective C. In updating my app for XCode 6 and iOS 8 I added the NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription item to my plist settings.  I tested and did not receive any location updates.  I then added the NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription key and that enabled updates to flow.  My question is Since I dont need location services when the app isnt running Id like to just use the WhenInUse permission but MapBox doesnt appear to work.  So, if forced to use AlwaysUsage Apple throws the scary waring permission question about the app using location services even when the app is running.p  pAm I missing something herep  pEdit  My location updates come from my RMMapViewDelegate methods.  If I use the NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription and the user allows always permission I get the updates.

Negative 2556 pI have a working implementation of DFP for Android in my app, where a PublisherAdView banner animates in when the ad is loaded i.e. after onAdLoaded is called in the attached AdListener.

And sometimes, the advert itself does not load properly inside the PublisherAdView and a grey box appears in the adverts place. p  pThe adverts are effectively little web pages with their own loading cycle but I have searched around and cannot find any way of monitoring the loading of the advert inside the PublisherAdView to tell if it has displayed correctly is this possiblep

In addition to filename, for example, I can get the alttext, the pid, the imagedate, the imageslug, thumbFolder, thumbPrefix, for example. Those all work. Others, like path and slug, either of which I could use to build my URL, always come back with the value secondgallery which is the name value. It seems to be the default fallback for any value that fails to be extracted.  Ive even tried codetheimagegtorigimagegtpathcode, but that produces nothing.  Using the square bracket approach, i.e. codetheimage[path]code just causes the entire site to mess up.

Negative 2556 pI have an excel macro that opens an infopath .xml file and allows the user to modify specific nodes using the SelectSingleNode method.

Negative 2556 pIm attempting to create a Core Graphics pattern in iOS based on user input. I dont have much experience with drawing and am stuck on where to begin. The pattern will be a rows and columns of squares. At some point the color of the squares will change, likely midrow, based on what the pattern is counting for the user.p  pFor now, Im simply trying to draw the basic pattern, and will work into the customization later. The views frame and bounds are set using a storyboard. My initial thought was to draw the squares with a loop. For example, if I wanted to draw a 52x80 grid of 3x3 squares offset by 1, I could do the followingp  precode voiddrawRectCGRectrect       CGRect square  CGRectMake0,0,3,3      UIBezierPath path  [UIBezierPath bezierPathWithRectsquare]     [[UIColor redColor] setStroke]     [[UIColor redColor] setFill]      for int i  0 ilt52 i4        for int i  j jlt80 j4          [path moveToPointCGPointMakei, j]         [path fill]              codepre  pObviously, this doesnt work. A full answer isnt necessary if youd rather just provide a little guidance on where to look or where Im going wrong. p

Negative 2556 pI came accross a problem here this week. In my case I try to update report builder via macro and then refresh the file to update pivots. I want to do this for multiple workbooks.p  pI used this macrop  precodeApplication.Wait Now  TimeValue000002  Dim addIn As COMAddIn Dim automationObject As Object Dim success As String Set addIn  Application.COMAddInsReportBuilderAddIn.Connect Set automationObject  addIn.Object success  automationObject.RefreshAllRequestsActiveWorkbook Application.Wait Now  TimeValue000010  SheetsWeek on week 2015.Select ActiveWorkbook.RefreshAll ActiveWorkbook.RefreshAll ActiveWorkbook.RefreshAll RangeF8.Select ActiveWorkbook.RefreshAll ActiveWorkbook.Save ActiveWindow.Close codepre  pIt seems the second Application.Wait is screwing the whole macro up. When I dont use the second Application.Wait the issue is that the RefreshAll will start too early while Report Builder is still running. The first file will close and save while the second file opens. This wont work due to the fact that the first file still hass Report Builder running.p  pConclusion  Does anyone know a better way to waitpauze the macro while Report Builder can finish its update  Or does anyone know how to call the success line and activate a second part of the macro by identifying the completion of the succesline p

Negative 2556 pConsider a list code[1,1,1,...,1,0,0,...,0]code an arbitrary list of zeros and ones. We want the whole possible permutations in this array, therell be codebinomiall,kcode permutations codelcode stands for the length of the list and codekcode for the number of ones in the list.p  pRight now, I have tested three different algorithms  to generate the whole possible permutations, one that uses a recurrent function, one that calculates  the permutations via calculating the interval number code[1,...,1,0,0,...,0]code to code[0,0,...0,1,1,...,1]code since this can be seen as a binary number interval, and one that calculates the permutations using lexicographic order.p  pSo far, the first two approaches fail in performance when the permutations are approx. 32. The lexicographic technique works still pretty nice only a few miliseconds to finish.p  pMy question is, specifically for julia, which is the best way to calculate permutations as I described earlier I dont know too much in combinatorics, but I think a descent benchmark would be to generate all permutations from the total codebinomiall,l2codep

Negative 2556 pIm querying the MediaStore, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions31511461joiningcursorsandsortingjoining Images and Thumbnailsa, and loading in a GridView. This works fine enough, but I cant figure out how to update my app when a new photo appears in the MediaStore typically when taken by the camera. The default gallery app automatically loads the new image, but my app does nothing. Ive tried registering content observers, and Ive even tried adding a manual refresh menu button, but the only way to load the new image is to stop and restart the entire app.p  pstrongEditstrong Actually, thats not entirely true. If I take a new photo, and switch to some other gallery app or widget, then this other app will load the new image thumbnail and my app will then suddenly also refresh. This indicates that I emamem observing emsomeem events, right, since the new thumbnail eventually appears automatically in my app Maybe Im just not observing the right ones. I just dont understand how the manual refresh accomplishes nothing. p  pIm posting the relevant java files, maybe someone can see what Im forgetting, or am doing wrongp  pIm at a loss, been working at this for quite some time, so please forgive me if the post is too vague.

Negative 2556 pI have two Jetsons and I wish to send data to one another using java. I am able to send data to one of the jetsons and read from the port with no problem but when it comes to the other way around, the jetson that is supposed to send a specific data, just ends up sending random data over and over. p  pI opened up putty to see what was being sent without the java program running and I just get these random lines and occasional characters.

When I opened putty I changed the baud rate to 115200 and then after closing it, the system froze. I rebooted and then it started to work normally again but today I was writing some code using threads so that one of the Jetsons could continously listen to its RX port, after multiple failes, the same thing happened againthe other jetson keeps sending random data. I did a loopback test on the Jetson that was sending the random data, and I was able to echo back my own input from the keyboard. Then when I connected the wire back to the other Jetsons RX, random data was still being sent.p  pThe Jetsons loopback test are a success but when connecting to each other, thats when the problem occurs.Can someone help me outp

Negative 2556 pWe are in the process of developing a website using Angular JS and Rest Services build using Spring MVC and security.p  pThere is this feature where in user can download his daily tasks as csv file. Implementation for this is simple, user clicks the button , client sends http get request and server responds and sends the content and file gets downloaded successfully. This works perfectly fine on all the desktop browsers. However when using chrome on android I have observed that server gets the same request twice.p  pFirst when user clicks the button chrome sends the request.  When the server responds the download manager can be seen on android and the request is fired again.p  pHave a few question as to why am i seeing such a behavior p  p1 From what I understand the control goes to download manager and hence it makes a new request so that it could have more features like pause and resume and browser need not be blocked during the entire process p  p2 What happens to the data which was sent as part of the response to the first request p  p3 When we setup https on the application server the download status in download manager goes into queued status. Thinking over it I realised that it could be an issue because the certificate was self signed one  On importing the certificate into androids trust store every thing works fine.p  pCould any one kindly shed more light on the following questions.p

It resembles both folding and continuation passing style.p  precodegt newtype ChurchList a  CList runCList  forall r. a gt r gt r gt r gt r codepre  pFor illustration as to how this corresponds to a list, here is a On isomorphismp  precodegt fromList  [a] gt ChurchList a gt fromList xs  CList  cons empty gt foldr cons empty xs  gt toList  ChurchList a gt [a] gt toList cl  runCList cl  []  gt instance Show a gt Show ChurchList a where gt   show cl  fromList   show toList cl codepre  pThese things have good performance charecteristics.p  precodegt singleton  a gt ChurchList a  O1 gt singleton a  CList  cons empty gt a cons empty gt append  ChurchList a gt ChurchList a gt ChurchList a  O1 This also means cons and snoc are O1 gt append cl1 cl2  CList  cons empty gt runCList cl1 cons runCList cl2 cons empty gt concatCl  ChurchList ChurchList a gt ChurchList a  On gt concatCl clcl  CList  cons empty gt runCList clcl cl r gt runCList cl cons r empty gt headCl  ChurchList a gt Maybe a  O1 gt headCl cl  runCList cl a  gt Just a Nothing codepre  pNow, the problem comes with codetailcode.p  precodegt tailClbad  ChurchList a gt Maybe ChurchList a On gt tailClbad cl  fmap snd  runCList cl gt gt    a r gt Just a, case r of gt    Nothing gt CList  cons empty gt empty gt    Just s,t gt append singleton s t Cons gt gt    Nothing Empty codepre  pEssentially what my implementation does is split the list into head and tail. Cons replaces the head, and appends the old head unto the tail. This is rather inefficient. It seems that Church Lists are inefficient in general at splitting.p  pIm hoping that Im wrong. Is there an implementation of codetailClcode that is better than On preferably O1.p

I am listening to a server which is giving me latitudes and longitudes of events. I want to draw the event on the screen such that the circle increase in radius from 0 to 10 in 1 second. Because I am listening to the server I can have more than one datapoint in 1 second. How should I make plot another point while the previous one is still in transitionp  pThis is the code that I came up with but I am not able to figure out a way that I can add d3 type transition to the circle as that is only possible when you use d3.data[coords].enter. Using d3 here seems to me overkill since I can directly change the attributes. p  precodeltDOCTYPE htmlgt lthtmlgt   ltheadgt     ltmeta charsetutf8gt     ltscript srchttpd3js.orgd3.v3.min.jsgtltscriptgt     ltscript typetextjavascript srccode.jquery.comjquery1.8.0.min.jsgtltscriptgt     ltscript typetextjavascriptgt         document.ready                 function                      sse  new EventSourcemyeventsource                     sse.onmessage  functionmessage                          console.logA message has arrived                         var data  message.data.split,                          plotdata                                            ltscriptgt        ltscript type textjavascriptgt       function drawgeodata         use strict         var margin  75,          width  1920 margin,          height  1080 margin         var svg  d3.selectbody                     .appendsvg                     .attrclass,main                     .attrwidth, widthmargin                     .attrheight, heightmargin                     .appendg                     .attrclass,map   make map here  make a place for circle here to be selected later       svg.appendcircle           .attrr, 10                function plotdata         use strict         var margin  75,          width  1920 margin,          height  1080 margin           var spot  d3.selectsvg.main         convrt the long, lat to pixels x,y        var projection  d3.geo.mercator                            .scale220                            .translate[width2, height1.5]            var coords  projection[data[1], data[0]]         debugger         spot.selectcircle               .attrcx, coords[0]               .attrcy, coords[1]             ltscriptgt   ltheadgt    ltbodygt     ltscript type  textjavascriptgt     Use d3 to load the GeoJSON file     d3.jsonstaticworldcountries.json, draw     ltscriptgt   ltbodygt  lthtmlgt codepre
