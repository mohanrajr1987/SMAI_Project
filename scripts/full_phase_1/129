Positive 129 pMy homework is to write a C program with openGLGlut which, after getting groups of 4 points by mouse click points with 3 coordinates, should draw a bezier curve with adaptive algorithm. At a theoretical level its clear how the algorithm works but I dont know how to put that in C code. I mean that at lesson we saw that the 4 control points could have a shape similar to a trapeze and then the algorithm calculates the two heights and then checks if they satisfy a tollerance. The problem is that the user might click everywhere in the screen and the points might not have trapezelike shape...so, where can I start from This is all I havep  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comp4duQ.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comp4duQ.png altenter image description hereap  pThis is the cole I have written, which is called each time a control point is addedp  precodeif bezierMode  CASTELJAUADAPTIVE      glColor3f 0.0f, 0.8f, 0.4f  draw adaptive casteljau curve in green      fori0 i3ltnumCV i  3         adaptiveDeCasteljau3CV, i, 0.01    void adaptiveDeCasteljau3float CV[MAXCV][3], int position, float tolerance      float x01  CV[position][0]  CV[position1][0]  2   float y01  CV[position][1]  CV[position1][1]  2    float x12  CV[position1][0]  CV[position2][0]  2   float y12  CV[position1][1]  CV[position2][1]  2    float x23  CV[position2][0]  CV[position3][0]  2   float y23  CV[position2][1]  CV[position3][1]  2    float x012  x01  x12  2   float y012  y01  y12  2    float x123  x12  x23  2   float y123  y12  y23  2    float x0123  x012  x123  2   float y0123  y012  y123  2    float dx  CV[3][0]  CV[0][0]   float dy  CV[3][1]  CV[0][1]    float d2  fabsCV[1][0]  CV[3][0]  dy  CV[1][1]  CV[3][1]  dx   float d3  fabsCV[2][0]  CV[3][0]  dy  CV[2][1]  CV[3][1]  dx    ifd2  d3d2  d3 lt tolerance  dxdx  dydy         glBeginGLLINESTRIP           glVertex2fx0123, y0123       glEnd        return       float tmpLEFT[4][3]   float tmpRIGHT[4][3]    tmpLEFT[0][0]  CV[0][0]   tmpLEFT[0][1]  CV[0][1]   tmpLEFT[1][0]  x01   tmpLEFT[1][1]  y01   tmpLEFT[2][0]  x012   tmpLEFT[2][1]  y012   tmpLEFT[3][0]  x0123   tmpLEFT[3][1]  y0123    tmpRIGHT[0][0]  x0123   tmpRIGHT[0][1]  y0123   tmpRIGHT[1][0]  x123   tmpRIGHT[1][1]  y123   tmpRIGHT[2][0]  x23   tmpRIGHT[2][1]  y23   tmpRIGHT[3][0]  CV[3][0]   tmpRIGHT[3][1]  CV[3][1]    adaptiveDeCasteljau3tmpLEFT, 0, tolerance   adaptiveDeCasteljau3tmpRIGHT, 0, tolerance    codepre  pand obviously nothing is drawn.

Positive 129 pI made two aplications using openGl.  One uses glDrawElements draws gltriangles and drawing some objects on the screen and works on all tested machines.  Second uses glDrawArrays to draw glpoints and uses computeshader to update theirs positions. This aplications runs only on my computer iam using VS2010 and AMD GPU. But on all other machines its giving black screen with no points and high gpu usage which probably means that computeshader works. All other computer had nVidia graphics cards, no AMD tested besides my.p  pI dont paste code because i assume if on my computer everything works as is suppose its something with drivers or dlls which are missing from windows or SysWOW64 folder.

Im only sure that problem lie in pinta.docking library since first run work correct as shown above. I tested against standard gtk widget like label and docking work correctly in all casesp  pSo i have two questions do you have any suggestion or wild guess where to look or you know about any better docking library for gtk that might work with gl context or know about open source editor that sucessfully implemented docking in gtkp
Positive 129 pIm writing a program that has a polygon man walk from one side of the screen to the middle, open his mouth, jump up and do a flip, land, close his mouth, and walk left off the screen. I am a bit confused on how to make the lads mouth open. I was thinking I could create a triangle of appropriate size the same color as the background and slowly translate it to where his mouth would be. What steps would I need to go through to make this possible, and where would I put the code to do sop  precode    includeltWindows.hgt includeltGLglut.hgt includeltstdlib.hgt includeltmath.hgt

Positive 129 pIm currently working on a particle system for my game. I want to handle basic collision with static and simple geometry. To do that, I generate an array of vector4 describing a segment two points with XY coordinates. Then in my vertex shader I use it to make my intersection test.p  pThe issue is that it works when I run the game on my NVidia GPU but not on my Intel Chipset.

Positive 129 pI am trying to do multigpu work on Linux, using specifically 2 k4200 quadros. I have attempted to use SLI, but even after changing the X11xorg.conf file using nvidiaxconfig for SLI to be SFR, it doesnt seem to be using the 2nd GPU glmark2 tests Ive tried remain in the same ballpark. So first question is how do I enable SLI for these cards in Linux Is it even possiblep  pIf its not possible, I was wondering if I can manually split the work amp perform offscreen rendering on each GPU. However, is there a LinuxX11 equivalent of wglEnumGpusNV to get list of available GPUs Also I was hoping to use glXCopyImageSubDataNV to copy data from one GPU to the other. Does that data transfer go through the CPU i.e. slow or does it go directly between the GPUs p

Positive 129 pin my CADlike application I store vector coordinates in arrays of following structuresp  precodestruct coord     double        x,y,z    unsigned char flags  codepre  px, y and z hold the 3D coordinates, flags contains additional information e.g. if a polygon ends here and line to next coordinate in this array has not to be drawn.p  pNow these data have to be converted to a plain floatarray with one float value for x, y and z each and with as many of these triples as there are points in the polygon to be drawn. Reason is the converted array of coordinates has to be handed over to OpenGL function glVertexAttribPointer to let OpenGL draw this polygon.p  pMy question what is the fastest way of converting these data My only idea is to allocate the target array and to go through it in a loop to cast the coordinate values down to float  which sounds quite slow for me.p  pAny other ideasp  pThanks p  p I know stackoverflow does not like to be friendly but in fact I like it to be friendly thats why I want to thank all people that try to give an answer here there are enough unfriendly places on this earth, stackoverflow should not be an other onep

Positive 129 pThe question I have is quite fundamental but for some strange reason I could not find a straight answer to this anywhere on the webp  pHow can I interpret OpenGL Window Coordinatesp  pI know how the NDC  Window Coordinates transformation works but what I dont see is a definition of how OpenGLs Window Coordinates relate to actual pixel coordinates where typically pixel centers are at whole numbers. Its basically a  0.5 pixel question.p  pFrom the OpenGL 4.5 spec 13.6.1  Controlling the Viewportbr ... x and y give the location of the viewports lower left corner ...p  pSo does lower left corner meanbr a the lower left corner strongof the lowestleftmost pixelstrong orbr b just the pixel coordinate of the lowest leftmost pixelp  pIf its a then I guess to go from Window Coordinates to Pixel coordinates one would have to subtract 0.5 from the WC.p

Positive 129 pIm currently working on an OpenGL project in Android. Right now, Im trying to create a clip for items to be confined to when drawing, using the stencil buffer. My problem is that I would like to be able to create a clip shape, and then remove portions of that clipped shape later on much like in an Android Canvas calling clipPath with Region.Op.UNION and then another clipPath call with Region.Op.DIFFERENCEp  pBasically, my intention is to only draw to portions of the screen with a stencil buffer bit of value 1. Therefore, as I understand it, I should be able to draw to the stencil buffer with different glStencilOp functions that will allow me to draw with 1s in some areas, and then perhaps replace them later on with the default 0 in portions of those areas.p  pAs an example test, I tried to clip a doughnut on the screen, using something like thisp  precodegl20.glClearGL20.GLDEPTHBUFFERBIT  Clear stencil buffer. gl20.glEnableGL20.GLSTENCILTEST  Enable stencil test. gl20.glColorMaskfalse, false, false, false  Disable color drawing. gl20.glStencilMask0xFF  Set 0xFF as stencil mask.   Have stencil test always fail, replace drawn stencil bits with 1. gl20.glStencilFuncGL20.GLNEVER, 1, 0xFF  gl20.glStencilOpGL20.GLREPLACE, GL20.GLKEEP,GL20.GLKEEP   Draw outer circle    Now, replace drawn stencil bits with 0. gl20.glStencilOpGL20.GLZERO, GL20.GLKEEP, GL20.GLKEEP   Draw inner circle.    Reenable color drawing.  gl20.glColorMasktrue, true, true, true  Now, items drawn will be confined to areas with 1 stencil bit. gl20.glStencilFuncGL20.GLEQUAL, 1, 0xFF gl20.glStencilOpGL20.GLKEEP, GL20.GLKEEP, GL20.GLKEEP gl20.glStencilMask0x00   Draw a filled, colored rectangle to the entire screen.  codepre  pNow, as I understand it, this should result in a colored doughnut drawn to the screen However, as the code is written above, nothing is drawn to the screen.p  pHowever, if I only clip the outer circle and not try to get rid of the inner circle with the gl20.glStencilOpGL20.GLZERO, GL20.GLKEEP, GL20.GLKEEP call and subsequent inner circle drawing, a circle the size of the intended outer circle draws on the screen. p  pIve looked through the documentation that I could find, and everything that Ive read so far indicates that this should work. Is there something that Im missing here Any help is greatly appreciated.p  pAlso, if this helps at all I am using the ShapeRenderer from the LibGDX open source project to draw shapes. p

Negative 129 pIm working on a JavaGroovy program.  I have a double variable that holds a number that was typed in by a user.

Negative 129 pstrongNotestrong For brevitys sake, the following will not discern between randomness and pseudorandomness. Also, in this context, constrained means between given min and max valuesp  pThe System.Random class provides random generation of integers, doubles and byte arrays.  Using Random.Next, one can easily generate random constrained values of type Boolean, Char, SByte, UInt16, UInt32. Using Random.NextDouble, one can similarly generate constrained values of types Double and Single as far as my understanding of this type goes. Random string generation of a given length and alphabet a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1344221howcanigeneraterandom8characteralphanumericstringsinchasa a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1572733generaterandomstringalsoa a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions730268uniquerandomstringgenerationbeena a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1122483crandomstringgeneratortackleda a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions54991generatingrandompasswordsbeforea.p  pConsider the remaining primitive data types excluding Object Decimal and UInt64. Their random generation has been tackled as well a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions609501generatingarandomdecimalincDecimala, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions677373generaterandomvaluesincUInt64a [using Random.NextBytes], but not when constrained. Rejection sampling i.e. looping until the generated value is the the desired range could theoretically be used, but it is obviously not a practical solution. Normalizing NextDouble wont work because it doesnt have enough significant digits.p  pIn short, I am asking for the proper implementation of the following functionsp  precodelong NextLonglong min, long max long NextDecimaldecimal min, decimal max codepre  pNote that, since System.DateTime is based on a ulong, the first function would allow for random constrained generation of such structs as well similar to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions194863randomdateincherea, only in ticks instead of minutes. p  pThanks in advancep

Swap is normally 3 lines long, but since it takes 2 references, calling it takes 5 lines. Of course it is nonsense and I simply write swap by hand each time I would like to call it. But this shows C prevents reusable code, bad.p  h2THE QUESTIONh2  pSo  what bad could happen if compiler automatically create temporary variables as I do by hand, call the function, and assign the values back to properties Is this any danger in it I dont see it so I am curious what do you think why the design of this issue looks like it looks now.p  pCheers,p  pstrongEDITstrong As 280Z28 gave great examples for beating idea of automatically wrapping ref for properties I still think wrapping properties with temporary variables would be useful. Maybe something like thisp  precodeSwapinout myclass.prop1,inout myclass.prop2 codepre  pOtherwise no real Swap for C p

Negative 129 pIm developer of a hrefhttprobocode.sourceforge.netRobocodea engine. We would like to make Robocode multilingual and Scala seems to be good match. We have Scala plugin a hrefhttpcode.google.comprobocodesourcebrowsesvnrobocodetrunkpluginsscalaprototype herea.p  pstrongThe problemstrong Because users are creative programmers, they may try to win battle different ways. As well robots are downloaded from online database where anyone could upload one. So gap in security may lead to security hole into users computer. Robots written in Java are running in restricted sandbox. Almost everything is prohibited [network, GUI, disk limited, threads limited, classloaders and reflection]. The sandbox is similar to browser applet. We use SecurityManager, custom ClassLoader per robot, a hrefhttpcode.google.comprobocodesourcebrowsesvnrobocodetrunkrobocode.hostsrcmainjavanetsfrobocodehostsecurityetc ...ap  pThere are two ways how to host Scala runtime in Robocodep  p1 load it together with robot inside of sandbox. Pretty safe for us, preferred solution. But it will damage Scala runtime abilities because runtime uses reflection. Maybe generates classes at runtime  Use threads to do some internal cleanup  Access to JVMinternals  I would not like to limit abilities of languagep  p2 use Scala runtime as trusted code, outside the box, security on same level as JDK. Visibility to malicious robot. Are the Scala runtime APIs safe  Do methods they have security guards  Is there any safe mode  Is there any singleton in Scala runtime, which could be abused to communicate between robots  Any concurencythreadpoolmessaging which could simulate threads  Is there any security audit for Scala runtimep  p3 Something in between, some classes of runtime in and some out. Which classespackages must be visible to robotwhich are just private implementation  this seems to be future solutionp  pstrongThe questionstrong Is it possible to enumerate and isolate the parts of runtime which must run in trusted scope from the rest  strongSpecific packages and classes strong Or better idea p  pIm looking for specific answer, which will lead to secure solution.

Negative 129 pLets say I have an codeOrdercode table which has a codeFirstSalesPersonIdcode field and a codeSecondSalesPersonIdcode field. Both of these are foreign keys that reference the codeSalesPersoncode table. For any given order, either one or two salespersons may be credited with the order. In other words, codeFirstSalesPersonIdcode can never be codeNULLcode, but codeSecondSalesPersonIdcode emcanem be codeNULLcode.p  pWhen I drop my codeOrdercode and codeSalesPersoncode tables onto the Linq to SQL Classes design surface, the class builder spots the two FK relationships from the codeOrdercode table to the codeSalesPersoncode table, and so the generated codeOrdercode class has a codeSalesPersoncode field and a codeSalesPerson1code field which I can rename to codeSalesPerson1code and codeSalesPerson2code to avoid confusion.p  pBecause I always want to have the salesperson data available whenever I process an order, I am using codeDataLoadOptions.LoadWithcode to specify that the two salesperson fields are populated when the order instance is populated, as followsp  precodedataLoadOptions.LoadWithltOrdergto gt o.SalesPerson1 dataLoadOptions.LoadWithltOrdergto gt o.SalesPerson2 codepre  pstrongThe problemstrong Im having is that Linq to SQL is using something like the following SQL to load an orderp  precodeSELECT ... FROM Order O INNER JOIN SalesPerson SP1 ON SP1.salesPersonId  O.firstSalesPersonId INNER JOIN SalesPerson SP2 ON SP2.salesPersonId  O.secondSalesPersonId codepre  pThis would make sense if there were always two salesperson records, but because there is sometimes no second salesperson codesecondSalesPersonIdcode is codeNULLcode, the codeINNER JOINcode causes the query to return no records in that case.p  pWhat I effectively want here is to change the second codeINNER JOINcode into a codeLEFT OUTER JOINcode. Is there a way to do that through the UI for the class generator If not, how else can I achieve thisp  pNote that because Im using the generated classes almost exclusively, Id rather not have something tacked on the side for this one case if I can avoid it.p  hr  pEdit per my comment reply, the codeSecondSalesPersonIdcode field emisem nullable in the DB, and in the generated classes.p

Negative 129 pI have a WPF application that stores a large amount of information in XML files and as the user uses the application they add more information to the XML files. Its basically using the XML files as a database. Since over the life of the program the XML files have gotten quite large, and Ive been think about putting the data on a website, Ive been looking into how to move all the information into an SQL database.p  pIve used SQL databases with web applications PHP, Ruby, and ASP.NET but never with a Desktop application. Ideally Id like to be able to keep all the information in one database file and distribute it along with the application without requiring the user to connect to a remote database so they dont need an internet connection  though eventually it would be nice if could compare the local files version with one online somewhere and update if necessary and without making them install a local database server on their computer. Is this possible p  pId also like to use LINQ with any new database solution so switching to a database doesnt force to many changes I read the XML with LINQ. p  pIm sure this question has been asked and that there are already some good tutorials on the subject but I just cant find them.p

Negative 129 pIt would be nice if there existed a program that automatically transforms Perl code to Python code, making the resultant Python program as readable and maintainable as the original one, let alone working the same way.p  pThe most obvious solution would just invoke codeperlcode via Python utilsp  precodeusrbinpython os.exectail n 2 file  perl  ...the rest of file is the original perl program... codepre  pHowever, the resultant code is hardly a Python code, its essentially a Perl code.  The potential converter should convert Perl constructs and idioms to easytoread Python code, it should retain variable and subroutine names i.e. the result should not look obfuscated and should not shatter the wrokflow too much.p  pSuch a conversion is obviously very hard.  The hardness of the conversion depends on the number of Perl features and syntactical constructs, which do not have easytoread, unobfuscated Python equivalents.  I believe that the large amount of such features renders such automatic conversion impossible empracticallyem  while emtheoreticalem possibility exists.p  pSo, could you please name Perl idioms and syntax features that cant be expressed in Python as concise as in the original Perl codep  pstrongEditstrong some people linked PythontoPerl conventers and deduced, on this basis, that it should be easy to write PerltoPython as well.  However, Im sure that converting emto Pythonem is in emgreaterem demand still this converter is not yet writtenwhile the reverse has already been  Which only makes my confidence in impossibility of writing a good converter to Python more solid.p

Negative 129 pI am facing few problems while using tabBar with navigation controllers.Each tabBar item is associated with a separate navigation controller.Problems are listed as followsp  p1.There are more than five tabBar items in my tabBar so a more tabBar item comes by default.Now when i tap the more tabBar item the remaining items come in a tableview which is actually the view of a navigation controllerwhich comes by default.Now when i select any of the row, my new view controller gets pushed into that navigation controller.I want my view controller to be the navigation controller.So there is a situation like pushing a navigation controller onto the sack of another navigation controller.The compiler gets confused and it does nothing.p  p2.Although I have set autoresizing of each controller of tab bar controller nothing happens on rotating the device.However when I keep only five or less tabBar items,autoresizing works perfectly.p  p3.I want an ImagView at the top throughout the application, so I attached an imageview on the window itself and than increases the ycoordinate of the tabBar controllers view so that the navigation bar of each tabBar controllers view starts just below the imageview.Everything is fine for the portrait mode but as soon as i rotate the device the imageview dissappears.And when i again come to portrait mode the imageview does not appear and the tabBar controllers view starts from the top.p  pI tried it every wayslike tabBar instead of tabBar controller etc. but fail to achieve anything helpful.  p

Negative 129 pI would like to know more about the extent it is possible to control where each Scala actor is running. I happen to be in a somewhat particular case  high reactivity is desired, a good part of the code is timecritical, and worst of all, Im on Android. With this in mind, my main goal is  make the code as readable and straightforward as possible.p  pWhat I would ideally want to achieve some of those sound unreasonabledownright stupid at first, read rationales belowbr  I would like to be able to respond to some messages in some particular, always the same, arbitrary thread, but I need to not be blocking it to wait for messages.br  I would like to have most my processing done on a pool of worker threads, ideally autoresizing as Scala actors support, while guaranteeing this processing will never take place on the arbitrary thread above.p  pThese requirements stem from an Android necessity  the Android framework uses a special thread to touch UI, and if you touch any UI object from another thread you get an exception. In this way, it enforces some sort of threadslock model which is exactly what Im trying to work around. But anyway, thats the way it is  I have to ensure some of my processing, namely what is dealing with UI objects, is running on this thread and no other, because the framework annoyingly says thats how I should do it. An annoying side effect of this is as long as this thread is processing my code the UI stops updating and my application stops being responsive. So I need to ensure that this thread does not get randomly selected for longrunning code I could have in some react, and ideally that it never processes something that may as well have be done by another thread.p  pThe android framework provides a class called Handle, which implements some kind of message passing  you send it a Runnable, and it will run on the UI thread. I can use that if I need to. Creating a Runnable each and every time significantly clutters the code  one thing that can be done would be to encapsulate it in some method so that I could write something likebr     onUIThread   some code  br ...which is much nicer than new Runnable  def run  . On the other hand, thats basically what the onUIThread function would be doing, so Id be creating two closures  and then Id have to deal with the details of memory allocation for closures. Id have to, because each time I allocate an object, the GC gets a chance to run and on Android thats usually a 150ms pause in execution, which will ruin my user experience if its happening in a critical execution path.p  pSo in the end br  Do I have any way of statically associating an actor with a thread, so that I could have a UI actor, react inside it and always have its code run on the UI thread   I know its bad design on its own, read the rationale above to see why I cant help it br  Do I have any way of ensuring this particular thread will never be considered for responding to a message in a react   Any suggestions of what I could do, given my constraints, to get better code legibility p

Call it ambitious but Im planning to devote a chunk of time over the next few months.p  pIn any case my question is Im trying to aim to keep plugins working... In essence any plugin that doesnt require their own table should be able to work. Thats the plan, can anyone suggest an approach to handling queries, effectively allowing me to parse queries from plugins.p  pOnly plugins though, the plan is to have all wordpress core core queries removed for Cassandra api calls...p

Negative 129 pI have been thinking for a good while about how to tackle the problem of implementing an ID based user system while using ASP.NET MVC. My goals, much like StackOverflows system are as followsp  ul liAllow the users to change their nicknames without the avoid duplicate restriction.li liAllow the users to authenticate via OpenID not with password for the time being.li ul  pI wanted to avoid as much rework as possible, so I at first thought of using the membership, role and perhaps profile providers, but I found they were username based.  I thought of adapting the hell out of the SqlMembershipProvider, by using the username field to store the IDs and throwing UnsupportedException on password based methods and the like, just so as to be able to use the other systems. But it feels unwieldy and kludgy if possible to do at all. p  pOn the other hand, maybe I should roll up my own user system, but Im not sure if even if I cant use the providers, I can still use some of MVCs features plug my code in with MVC emsomewhereem, I can think of AuthorizeAttribute off the top my head.p  pSo I was wondering if anyone had run into the same design problem, and what solutions they had come up with. p  pThe more detail the betterp

DataAccess contains the data access interfaces DataAccess.Impl contains the repositories LINQ to the DB Domain contains most of my data types and properties.  Impl contains my services i.e. AccountService.cs, EmailService.csp  pNow, as an exercise, I have added a Windows Service to this project and am attempting to call functionality from the DLLs in this service.  MY QUESTION IS, what layer should I be exposing to other applications and what should stay hidden p  ul liShould the service classes from the Impl folder be what programmers see li liOr the Repositories from DataAccess.Implli liOr, should i just lay it all out for the programmers to see As it looks now, this seems sort of confusing. li ul  pWhen I started reading about DDD I was assuming that the repositories would be hidden and accessed by the service classes, but I am finding I need to call  functionality from both in my client. Have I designed this wrong p  pMy other question has do do with namespace naming. When the Windows Service calls functionality from my core library, I have to do my includes as suchp  precodeusing Company.Product.ProductCore.Core.DataAccess.Impl  using Company.Product.ProductCore.Core.Domain  using Company.Product.ProductCore.Core.Impl codepre  pThis seems wordy. Looking at Microsofts DLLs, they seem to keep with a twotier convention  System.Linq, System.Text, etc. Having Company.Product.ProductCore.Core.Impl  seems messy and doesnt really tell the programmer what this namespace does but it is what was suggested by the example I read. Is there a best practice here p  pYour suggestions and any examples are seriously appreciated. p  pThanks. p

Negative 129 pIm working with a large database some tables 500000000 rows . Each day 310 millions rows should be replaced and each import is about 1 million rows so 310 times a day with CRON using LOAD DATA INFILE.  The problem is, that while making such big file import, MySQL eats 80 of CPU and all common queries going from website became very slow or website performance falls down.  Site is running under Amazons EC2 Windows 2008 server.  Does anyone know how to solve this problem within one EC2 instance without splitting database Thanks.p

Negative 129 pIm having an issue using JW Player 5.4 with Amazon Cloudfront.  I am using the JW Player Javascript Embed method to fall back to an HTML5 player on iOS.  This is working great, except sometimes the videos dont load properly from Cloudfront.  The player appears with a disabled play button.p  pThe strange thing is that this seems to happen sporadically.  We are almost getting a 5050 chance now.  Ive set up a page where I have two players loading the exact same video file.  The top is loading from the local server, while the bottom from Cloudfront.p  pa hrefhttpdj.jomrx.comvideo relnofollowhttpdj.jomrx.comvideoap  pIf you view this page on an iPhone 4 in my tests, the top player always works correctly.  However the bottom has the issue described above.  If you refresh a bunch of times youll hopefully see what I am experiencing.p  pSomeone suggested that the loading of the video metadata is timing out.  However I thought Cloudfront was supposed to be fast as a CDN and wouldnt expect a timeout  latency issue.  Any other ideas on what might be causing the issue  Ive searched and searched but havent found any good results yet.p  pThanks a bunchp  pMore info JW Player support topic a hrefhttpwww.longtailvideo.comsupportforumsjwplayersetupissuesandembedding17781videooniphoneissueflashplayerwithhtml5fallback relnofollowhttpwww.longtailvideo.comsupportforumsjwplayersetupissuesandembedding17781videooniphoneissueflashplayerwithhtml5fallbackap  pUpdate Looks like this might not be an issue with JW Player.

I dont know many of the technical details and Im not sure why, but apparently AWS says that Mobile Safari is sometimes rejecting the SSL certificated served by Cloudfront.

Negative 129 pRestating my question to be simpler....p  pI want to be able to link an Action Script event to clicking text within a text box.The only thing I can see is to just create a basic Hyper Link, but not apply any actionp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.compmp3u.png altenter image description herep  pI have been messing around for over an hour but just cant see a way to apply actionscript and all the tutorials on the internet seem to target ActionScript 3 or not do exactly what I want.p  pThe reason for this is that there is background music to the site and when YouTube is launched, it needs to be muted. I know the code to mute and have done this on custom objects before, but I cant see any way to apply script to a textbox hyperlink.p  pWhilst I would ideally like to do it this way, I am happy to consider any solution resulting in opening a page and muting the site.p  pTo be honest, I tried doing a quick switch to AS3, but as there are so many problems that would need addressing, I would rather spend the time converting the site to HTMLJquery or even Silverlight.... I just hope there is something small I have overlooked which can get this done without too many changes needed.p

Negative 129 pAnyone have any ideas on how to do this I am new and need to know how to implement this assignment. Really need advice on starting out with this project, thanks.p  pHere is the codep  precodepackage code  import java.util.HashMap import java.util.LinkedList import java.util.List        This assignment involves character by character   processing, but this time the characters are not coming from a String, they   are coming from a file.      Because Javas file input classes throw various exceptions, which we do not   yet know how to handle, I am providing you with a class which deals with   those exceptions UBFileReader. This is an iterator for a file.   You will be able to use this class during your writeup, but its source will   be hidden from you.               Overall, the project is a review viewer for various products. The information   about the reviews and products will be stored in a text file in the following format   Products start with ltpgt and end with ltpgt   Reviews start with ltcgt and end with ltcgt   So given the input ltpgtMkayltpgtltcgtBrown and hairy.ltcgt   The product would be Mkay   The review would be Brown and hairy.      The products and reviews should be stored in a HashMapltString, LinkedListltStringgtgt   where the key is the product and the value is a linked list containing all of the   reviews for the product.      The products and reviews and then displayed in a beautiful light grey and yellow   graphical user interface. The user can use this to browse the available products   and read their reviews. The user interface will be supplied for you, so all you   need to take care of is putting the appropriate information in the HashMap.        public class TagFileParser              Reads a file identified by inputFilePath, one character at a time.       Products start with ltpgt and end with ltpgt as explained above.        Reviews start with ltcgt and end with ltcgt as explained above.       Any text not inside of one of these tags should be ignored.              You may use only CharacterFromFileReader to read characters from the       input file.              In order to simplify the code writing experience, it is recommended       that you use a switch statement where the case would be the state.       This way, you only need to worry about what happens when you are at       that state. You should, however, fully understand the state diagram       as a whole and in parts, as you will be required to complete this       assignment next week at the beginning of lab.              param String                  inputPath the path on the local filesystem to the input file       returns a HashMap containing the productgtlinked list of reviews mappings.            public HashMapltString, ListltStringgtgt fillHashMapString inputPath          return null        codepre

There seems to be a lot of information regarding mapping value objects as components. However I would like to normalise my database in some instances therefore would give the value object a persistence identity which if Im correct, doesnt violate DDD value object rules.p  pI have seen a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1331178separatetableforvalueobjectsonnhibernatethisa question on SO, but would like a bit more info on how to setup and map the actual value object.p  pI am comfortable when mapping a value object to a table which represents the entity. For example mapping an address value object into the customer table as a component.p  pMy query lies in when mapping a value object which i want to place in a separate table. Is the best way to map the value object using classmap like below I am planing to ignore the Id it is purely there for nhibernate persistence.p  precodepublic class Address    protected virtual int id get   public virtual string firstLine get   public virtual string city get   public virtual string postcode get   public class AddressMap  ClassMapltAddressgt    public AddressMap        Idx gt x.Id     Mapxgt x.firstline     Mapxgt x.city     Mapxgt x.postcode     codepre  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 129 pi am rendering a textbox to an offscreen buffer using RenderTargetBitmap and i want to enter text into this textbox, however, i cant set the textbox focus using Focus has no effect  presumably because the canvas is not attached to a real window this has two consequenes 1 the keyboard input doesnt get captured 2. even if i set the text manually using TextBox text and CaretIndex  index i dont get a caret because of the lack of focus. is there a way to make this focus somehow and if not, id like to at least have the caret visible even if there is no focus, but cant see a way of doing this.p

Negative 129 pThis is an odd situation for me.  We have a large project using OSGI and Im modifying one of the bundles.  Most of the changes work fine, except that when I try to update one part of the code to read some XML the bundle refuses to load.  I get an error message stating that my bundle is missing a constraint for jogl version 0.0.0.  My Bundle does not directly use JOGL, although a bundle its dependent on does use JOG.  We have a jogl1.1.1 bundle installed which is sufficient to load all the other JOGL dependent bundles p  pBy commenting out parts of the code and testing Ive discovered that I can import all of the appropriate classes, but the moment I try to use DocumentBuilderFactory to parse the XML I get the complaint about missing a JOGL bundle.  This occurs even if I add the DocumentBuilderFactory into a method that is never called and occurs despite my ensuring the XMLAPIS jar is in the class path.p  pIm at a complete lost for how XML parsing could be connected to JOGL.  Is a bundle version of 0.0.0 even valid  I dont know where to go from here, so any suggestion as to the cause of this behavior or what I could try to address it is appreciated.p  pThanksp
Negative 129 pI run a Symfony 1.4 project with very large amount of data. The main page and category pages are using pagers which need to know how much rows are available. Im passing a query which contains joins to the pager which leads to a loadingtime of 1 minute on these pages.p  pI configured cache.yml for the respective actions. But I think the workaround is insufficient and here are my assumptionsp  pSymfony rebuilds the cache within a single request which is made by a user. Lets call this user cachevictim to simplify things.p  pIn our case, the data needs to be uptoupdate  a lifetime of 10 minutes would be sufficient. Obviously, the cache wont be rebuilt, if no user is willing to be the cachevictim and therefore just cancels the request. Are these assumptions correctp  pSo, I came up with this idea Symfony should fake the httprequest after rebuilding the cache. The new cacheentries should be written on a temporary filedirectory and should be swapped with the previous cacheentries, as soon as cache rebuilding has finished.p  pIs this possiblep  pIn my opinion, this is similar to the concept of double buffering.p  pWouldnt it be silly, if there was a single gpuvictim in a multiplayer game who sees the screen building up line by line This is a lopsided comparison, I know ...  p  pstrongEditstrongp  pThere is no cachevictim  Every 10 minutes page reloading takes 1 minute for every user.p

Negative 129 pIm developing a single page application using backbone.js, mustache and jquery for the front end and Groovy on Grails for the backend.  My app needs to show some dates to the user in the interface exact dates formatted according to the users locale rather than 30 days ago or whatever, and all data is sent to the UI using JSON with the dates encoded in ISO 8601 standard.p  pHowever when I need to show a date on screen im not sure of the best way of going about this, should I use javascript to convert the date to something human readable  And how do I get the users locale and work out what the date format is  Is there a good library to do this  Another approach would be to include the date in the JSON twice, once using ISO8601 and another humanreadable given the locale in the request header. p  pJust wondered if other people have tackled this and what your final solutions were.  Cheers.p
Negative 129 pMy goal is to do this User selects settings file, settings are read and the UI is updated correspondingly. Saving should also be possible obviously. p  pMy program is currently not WPFXAML and doing this now would mean a lot of repetition and added work when new settings are required. p  pSo someone told me WPFXAML was the way to go, I looked into it and liked it but Im still not sure how to do what I want. The advantage of WPFXAML is of course data bindings, but if I want to read a whole settings file Id probably replace the old settings object with a new one. Can I make a WPF program react to this and update fields according to some given data bindingsp  pIm mostly interested in wether this is good design and if not  what is.p
Negative 129 pI want to extend the filter behavior of a Telerik RadGrid. If the user for instance filters the grid with the following word michele it should also return the rows which include michle.

So your changes to the DynamicLinq class will not effected the ExpressionParser used internally into the RadControls. However you could try changing the Dynamic Linq library and perform custom filtering by getting the filter expression from the RadGrid parse and pass them to the changed Dynamic Linq class method and bind the RadGrid to the returned data. I have attached a small sample which demonstrates how to use RadGrids filtersort expressions to filter, sort and page through ObjectDataSource.p blockquote

I dont mean that Im using attrprotected to stop people from logging into each others accounts, Im using an entirely normal authentication setup. p  pWhat Im referring to is protecting from the type of attackfromafriend where you leave your account open on your machine, someone sits down at it and changes your password. This can be mostly protected against by requiring the old password before creating the new one. That is perfectly achievable even with password set to attaccessible but requires you flushing the new one first.p  pI would feel more comfortable if the old password is required to update it and that is all much cleaner if password is codeattrprotectedcode in the first place. p

Negative 129 pMy lower level knowledge of SQL Server 2008 is limited, and is now being challanged by our DBAs. Let me explain I have mentioned obvious statements in the hope that I am right, but if you see something wrong, please tell me the scenariop  pWe have a table which holds Court Orders for people. When I created the table, Name CourtOrder, I created it likep  precodeCREATE TABLE dbo.CourtOrder    CourtOrderID INT NOT NULL IDENTITY1,1, Primary Key   PersonId INT NOT NULL,    around 20 other fields of different types.  codepre  pI then applied a nonclustered index to the primary key for efficiency. My reasons is that it is a unique field primary key, and should be indexed, mainly for selection purposes, as we often codeSelect from table where primary key  ...codep  pI then applied a CLUSTERED index on PersonId. The reason was to group orders for a particular person physically, as the vast majority of work is getting orders for a person. So, codeselect from mytable where personId  ...codep  pI have been pulled up on this now. I have been told that we should put the clustered index on the primary key, and the normal index on the personId. That seems very strange to me. First off, why would you put a clustered index on a unique column what is it clustering Surely thats a waste of the clustered index Id have believed a normal index would be used on a unique column. Also, clustering the index would mean we cant cluster a different column One per table, right.p  pThe reasoning for me being told I have made a mistake is that they believe putting a clustered index on the PersonId would make inserts slow. For the 5 gain in speed of a select, we would be getting a 95 degradation in speed on inserts and updates. Is that correct and validp  pThey say that because we cluster the personId, SQL Server has to rearrange data when ever we insert or make a change to the PersonId.p  pSo then I have asked, why would SQL have the concept of a CLUSTERED INDEX, if its so slow Is it as slow as theyre saying How should I have setup my indexes to achieve optimum performance Id have thought SELECT is used more than INSERT... but they say that were having locking issues on INSERTS...p  pHope someone can help me.p

Negative 129 pI have a developer in another country who is accessing svn from there. Now we had an issue with the firewall, and he could not access the repository for a while. The firewall error should be fixed now, and it works again for others. This devs gets the error emErroraccess to svnpathlotsofnumbers forbiddenem though.

The permissions are also correct, I just double checked them.p  pCould the problem lie in the firewall somehow, or does anyone have another suggestionp

Negative 129 pThis is one of those questions that seems to fall into the naively obvious but probably wrong category. Certainly, Im struggling to find a solution that works in all corner cases. It seems like this must be a problem that is encountered all the time.p  pI have a hardware thread and a processing thread.p  pThe hardware thread is run in a closed binary library that I dont have access to.p  pThe processing thread registers a callback with the hardware thread to be notified of certain rare events related to state changes in the hardware.p  pI wish to be able to notify the event loop in the processing thread that the state has changed. Id like to do this without requiring a dependance on an external library or in a non portable way, and without using locks as I have no idea when the hardware thread may want to notify the processing thread again.p  pSo, my thinking at present as to how to solve this is something like as followsp  precodeinclude ltsignal.hgt   sigatomict is used so update is always in a sane state static volatile sigatomict update  0   called from hardware thread int callbackfunction      update  1    called regularly from processing thread int processingfunction      static sigatomict localupdate  0  The same type as update      if localupdate  update         updateinternalhardwarestate  We necessarily call once per callback         localupdate  1       codepre  pClearly this is going to break if ever codeupdatecode wraps around and just happens to reach the value of codelocalupdatecode before codeprocessingfunctioncode is next called though almost certainly I can assume this will never happen.p  pHave I missed something subtle or not so subtle herep  pIs there a better way to solve this whole problemp  pThe callback can be assumed to be only ever called from one thread the hardware thread.p

Negative 129 pI currently use Dropbox as my backup solution for source and resources  and its fine and dandy and has saved my bacon many times.p  pI find myself in need of a proper version control system now tho  and I really dont want to put a repository INSIDE my Dropbox folder.p  pFor one thing, it will fill my Dropbox allowance pretty quickly  for another, I dont really want Dropbox and the versioncontrol software fighting over files.p  pSo Im thinking of doing something like this Im using Mercurial but Im sure the same theory applies to other VC stuffp  precodeMYDOCS Folder lt this is where the repo will go     .hg for Mercurial in this case     DROPBOX Folder         WORK FOLDER             PROJECT1             PROJECT2             PROJECT3             ... codepre  pThat way, everything I work on is covered by Dropbox  but my version control is outside of Dropbox.p  pObviously not every file in my DROPBOX folder is version controlled  and Im stuck with only 1 Repository for ALL my work not ideal but can anyone see any other snags with this approachp  pNote MYDOCS is backedup separately much less often so theres no risk of file loss here.p  pp.s.p  pI spent a bit of time over the weekend implementing this using MercurialTortoiseHG and it seems to work quite well.p  pThere are some snags  you have to set aggressive ignore filters in the end I just used  and added code manually otherwise TortoiseHG has a heartattack staring at 10s of 1000s of files every time it looks for changesnew files to add.p  pThis means it wont spot new files in existing projects too which is a minor painintheneck  it would be great if Mercurial actually had an INCLUDE filter at times like this...p  pp.p.s. I had a bright idea to make this a BIT easier.p  pI created a new folder outside the Dropbox called Repo and inside that I created a Directory Junction link for you nix types to the directory inside my Dropbox which contains all my source my Eclipse Workspace directory  basically.p  pI then put my repo into the repo folder  that way its not overseeing my entire Dropbox, just the part of it I want it to  and its still not inside my Dropbox p

Now Id like to take advantage of the association functionality in emberdata, but I am getting errors when I trie to bind the content of my array proxy to the children property of the DS.Model. My code is below and there is a jsfiddle here a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netsohara7p6gb22 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netsohara7p6gb22ap  pThe error I get isp  precodeUncaught TypeError Object App.recipeController.content.ingredients has no method addArrayObserver codepre  pI would like to be able to retain a controller layer, even if the data associations are controlleed at the model level.

Negative 129 pIm very new to ASP.NET and imagine this is possible, but I have a grid view with a handful of columns. One of the columns has a button, that when clicked, Id like a box to appear below the button to ensure its visibility that allows the user to add comments, submit comments, and cancel. Im not too worried about the last three pieces of functionality yet, but am stuck on just getting the comments box to pop up in the right spot.p  pMy idea functionality would be to have the rows below the clicked button the shift down to leave a space for the comments box, and once it is submitted, to have it disappear and the other rows back in place. The second best solution would be to have a popup window.p  pI must also note that I am on a closed system that cannot have any plugins installed, though it does have jquery.p  pI can elaborate on my problem if needed.p

Hosts file only accepts domains, and I might not be skilled enough to issue the proper route or arp commands.p  pExample ping 85.85.82.83 lt NOT A DOMAIN NAME reply 127.0.0.1p  pSo please help me redirect a public ip address to a local ip address, so that a simple ping of the originally public ip address points instead to the local ip address assigned.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 129 pIve already asked a similar question some time ago but now I can be much more specific.

Negative 129 pIm having a problem which I cant seem to find a solution to, and since Im not much of a COM expert learned the basics by myself over the last month or so, I thought Id ask around to see if there is a solution to my problem. I am working with visual studio 2003 VC and right now I have a main program MFC dialogbased exe that wants to access some Administratorlevel permissions when a certain dialogbox in opened. I read a bit about this and found out it is not possible to give administrative privileges to an already running process, and that I needed to use the COM elevation moniker to create a new process with administrative rights. httpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopms67968728vvs.8529.aspx Thats where the problem begins.p  pRight now, I have a COM atl dll with MFC support, merging of the proxystub code and support for COM, and I need to host an ActiveX control based on IWebBrowser2 in the one dialog contained MFC Dialog in this dll. However, after going through the elevation process and calling the exposed method to show the dialog, it always fails to launchdisplay. I have been looking around for solutions, and stumbled around some things, but cannot seem to fix the problem. Here are some things I have done p  pAdded AfxEnableControlContainer in the dlls InitInstance  CoInitializeExNULL, COINITMULTITHREAD in the thread that calls the dll. This actually causes the program to get an assertion fail wincore.cpp, line 884, afxmaphwnd  NULL apparently when trying to call the dialogs DoModal.p  pI tried purely removing the ActiveX control inside the dialog and if I do so, it seems to work fine, so the problem really looks like its linked with the ActiveX control.p  pI tried creating a nonmodal dialog never know I guess but the same problem occursp  pI have observed that in the output I get the following errors when the dialog is created dont know if it is the cause or consequence of my problem though  Firstchance exception at ...  0x800706BE The remote procedure call failed. Firstchance exception at ...  0x800706BA The RPC server is unavailable.p  pI might be missing something very basic student at University right now, so I might not know some stuff that may seem obvious to some, so if anyone has an idea about what might be wrong, please tell me.p

Negative 129 pSo our project use PostgreSQL database and we use JPA for operating the database.

Which is wrong for me, because if I make changes to the table on my own, by adding new entries, the GeneratedValue for application is lower than the current ID  what leads us to exception with duplicated ID. Can we fix it p  pema short note on the answerem There was a little lie from my side because weve used a PG Admin  View first 100 Rows and edited rows from there instead of using select. ANYWAY, it turns out that this editor somehow skips the process of updating the ID and so even in DB when we write a proper INSERT it is EXECUTED with improper ID So it was basically more a problem of the editor we used than the database and application...p  pnow it even works using codeGeneratedValuestrategyGenerationType.IDENTITYcodep

Negative 129 pIm searching for a method to calculate the volume of a threedimensional irregular object in either python or R.  I have a time series of files around 50 per sequence, equally spaced in time. They consist of a triangular mesh representation of the object with a fixed number of triangles. The vertices have known x,y,zcoordinates. There is no need for regenerating the mesh. And no need for visualization. The triangles have indices, the points as well. The object is not necessarily completely convex. But there are no  unnecessary points. All known points are part of the hull. Now, I would like to calculate the volume of the object at each time point.p

The authlogic gem installed by Heroku is not the one specified in the Gemfile. The only reason Im suspecting the authlogic gem is because it lists sqlite3 as a development dependency.

None of these have worked. Heroku still installs the wrong version of authlogic and attempts to install sqlite3.p  pHow do I get Heroku to stop trying to install the sqlite3 gemp  pYour help is much appreciatedp

Negative 129 pI have not found any good resource on here so I thought it would be great to get this up and out there... and stop me from pulling my hair out.  p  pActing like the app Agenda calendar app  I have a tableview with each cell representing a day.  The next step is to place the eventsArray inside the appropriate cell  through cellForRowAtIndexPath.  p  pI am only familiar with displaying the eventsArray with sections and rows  using each indexPath to represent an event... not an array of events. Below I posted working code for others looking for help in that department, and as a reference.p  pIt would be great if someone could put up some code to execute the eventsArray inside a single cell  Im assuming it is a use of the cellForRowAtIndexPath I am not familiar with.

Negative 129 pI want to do a 3d plot with mayavi2 using mayavi.mlab.surf. This function has an argument called warpscale that can be used to scale the z axis, Im looking for something similar but for the x and y axes.p  pI can do this manually by multiplying the x and y arrays and then using the ranges argument in mayavi.mlab.axes to correct the axes labels, however Im looking for a more direct approach like that of warpscale.p  pThanks p

I did come across this a hrefhttpforum.springsource.orgarchiveindex.phpt26844.html relnofollowposta which reported the same error, and was caused by a prefix being set on the beans.

Negative 129 pI asked this question in a different format and XSLT was mentioned but dont think I explained the solution I need. I have two xml files and using Java and I am trying to write a program that will accept a source and target xml file and for the most part they will have the same structure except the source will have some new elements added and I need to figure out how I can navigate the source DOM and if an element is not found in the target then add it or at this point even just have the program output what elements are not found in the target file making it easier to manually modify the target file. Does anyone know of a utility where I can do something like this and just get a list of elements not found in the target xml file. Am I correct to use a DOM parser vs. SAX. I need help on this, have to write it today and have about 50 xml files to merge p  pAm I thinking in line with the idea of navigating the entire source DOM for each node or element get the full path like peoplepersonjohn and then on my target DOM somehow test to see if that node exists Does this sound more like DOM or a SAX parsing paradigm p

Negative 129 pCurrently an application I made in PHPCodeigniter uses the SimplePie library to parse feeds. There is one main external feed it fetches that it checks every 5 mins for new items using a cron job. For one off feed fetches it is okay to just run a huge feed dump and parse the RSS items into the database. However, I am wondering if there is a better way to do this. p  pI know of the google API, however it has limits such as 100 entries, which is not such a bad thing since I will be checking often and there will be only a few entries to update with. However, if im going to use the service to poll the API and Feed every 5 mins, I might run into issues later.p  pstrongSo my question isstrong  is there a better way to handle such things like RSS in the modern web Moving away from SimplePie and moving to the google feed API was initially attractive because of the caching, quick response and json response. A way of detecting an update to the feed without a frequent cron job would be nice.p

Negative 129 pI know this question has been addressed many times on SO, but for the life of me I cant get it to work, none of the solutions proposed are fixing the problem for me. So here is the scenario, I have a main form where the user enters some data, and uploads a picture. The upload is happening via ajax using valums file uploader, so the file is posted to the controller as soon as its uploaded, I then resize the picture server side and return a thumbnail which is contained inside a partial view. The partial view is on the same view that the user enters their details in. This all works perfectly fine the first time, and the file is sent to the server and a thumbnail is generated and returned to the partial view, but this is not happening the second time.

I want the table columns to have equal widths, so I have set codetd widthcode to 25.p  pI would think that the table rows would inherit their size from the table, and the table cells would then each be one quarter of that. This seems to work when the device width is 768px or greater. When the device width is smaller, the rows are sized based on the text in the largest cell, as opposed to the size of the parent table.p  pI have included some sample code below, with background coloring on the different elements to highlight the error made apparent by resizing the window horizontally. The errors are highlighted in yellow where the underlying table colour is visible.p  pLive example a hrefhttppastehtml.comviewcqrwl31z2.html relnofollowhttppastehtml.comviewcqrwl31z2.htmlap  pI have tested in Chrome and Safari.p  precodeltDOCTYPE htmlgt lthtmlgt   ltheadgt     lttitlegtTable Testlttitlegt     lt Bootstrap gt     ltlink hrefhttpwww.bootstrapcdn.comtwitterbootstrap2.2.2cssbootstrapcombined.min.css relstylesheet mediascreengt     ltscript typetextjavascript srchttpwww.bootstrapcdn.comtwitterbootstrap2.2.2jsbootstrap.min.jsgtltscriptgt      ltmeta nameviewport contentwidthdevicewidth, initialscale1.0gt      ltstylegt         td, th  width 25 important          table  backgroundcolor yellow          tr  backgroundcolor gray          th  backgroundcolor aqua          tdnthchild1  backgroundcolor red          tdnthchild2  backgroundcolor green          tdnthchild3  backgroundcolor blue          tdnthchild4  backgroundcolor purple      ltstylegt   ltheadgt   ltbodygt     ltdiv classcontainergt         lth1gtHello, worldlth1gt         ltdiv classrowgt                    lttable classspan12gt                 lttheadgt                     lttrgt                         ltthgtAltthgt                         ltthgtBltthgt                         ltthgtCltthgt                         ltthgtDltthgt                     lttrgt                 lttheadgt                 lttbodygt                     lttrgt                         lttdgt1lttdgt                         lttdgt2lttdgt                         lttdgt3lttdgt                         lttdgt4lttdgt                     lttrgt                 lttbodygt             lttablegt         ltdivgt          ltdiv classrowgt             lttable classspan12gt                 lttheadgt                     lttrgt                         ltthgtLonger Tableltthgt                         ltthgtHeaders Inltthgt                         ltthgtThisltthgt                         ltthgtTableltthgt                     lttrgt                 lttheadgt                 lttbodygt                     lttrgt                         lttdgt1lttdgt                         lttdgt2lttdgt                         lttdgt3lttdgt                         lttdgt4lttdgt                     lttrgt                 lttbodygt             lttablegt         ltdivgt     ltdivgt   ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre

Negative 129 pThe Python requests library is currently all the rage, because of the beautiful interface that it provides for making HTTP requests  but beneath it there seems to be many layers of indirection  sessions, HTTP adapters, and finally the mechanics of urllib3.p  pWhere in this stack of abstractions is the right place to intervene if I already hold an open socket, and want to use requests to send an HTTP response down that socket and receive a reply backp  pWithout some kind of intervention or customization, the stack will try to create a new TCPIP socket for me, but in my particular application my code is not called until a connection has already been established on my behalf, so I will need to convince Requests to talk on that existing socket if I want to be able to use Requests features.p  pThe Requests libraryp  pa hrefhttppypi.python.orgpypirequests relnofollowhttppypi.python.orgpypirequestsap  pa hrefhttpsgithub.comkennethreitzrequests relnofollowhttpsgithub.comkennethreitzrequestsap

Negative 129 pIn a project I worked recently, noticed that some methods that were accepting stronga class that belongs to a hierarchystrong, had code similar to followingp  precodepublic void ProcessAnimal animal      ifanimal.GetType  typeofDog          Console.WriteLineWe have a dog          else          Console.WriteLinenot a dog       codepre  pWell, that struck me as a blatant violation of emLSPem, because now strongif you use a subclass of a dogstrong, either in production code, unit testing mock, or as a part of dependency injection interceptor strongthis code will not work the same waystrong. I believe this particular scenario can be fixed easily, by changing condition top  precode  if animal is Dog codepre  pThat got me thinking though p  pAre there any other pitfalls to look for that can break LSP in client code brp  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pJust to clarify, I am looking for possible pitfalls in code that uses the class in a hierarchy. I am aware and I am not looking for problems with badly contstructed hierarchies  e.g. rectangle  square problem. I am trying to find out what to look for, to make sure that the code will support dynamic mocks,  interceptors, decorated classes e.g. LoggingDog the same way as it would handle original class. p  pSo far after going through the answers and links I can see that the only pitfall would be to use type of the class directly  that is use codeGetTypecode method directly or through some other technology. Despite some comments here codeiscode and codeascode operators, and even casting to base type will not break LSP in this case, as subclasses will evaluate the same way the original class would.p

Negative 129 pWe are trying to create a quick order form where a client inputs an item SKU and its quantity, then tabs down to the next row and does the same.

We have looked at various codes and have found those that work by adding a new row and by checking against a single input, but we cannot find nor am able to write the code that allows for both. Not sure if we can allow for the input to have its name attribute use name[] or if it needs a set name, name1, name2, etc. If we use name[], how does the call to the database know which inut field to use to get the variable. p  pAny help is greatly appreciated.

Negative 129 pI am currently having trouble including resources from the NDK manifest file and I am sure that it is a quick fix error. There are plenty of files that are shared between projects and operating systems in a large library.  Therefore, in order to keep the files up to date with other projects and keep from updating each individual project with the latest API each time an update occurs, a whole bunch of native header and source code files need to be referenced with relative paths.p  pWithin Eclipse, I have clicked and dragged across the files without copying them, but by using a relative path that would be needed by the current application in a local folder structure in the project.p  prepprojectFolder    jni       externalProjectFiles          src          include pre  pWith this folder structure within Eclipse I have an Android.mk file with the following structurep  precodeLOCALPATH  call mydir  include CLEARVARS  LOCALMODULE  projectLib  LIBRARYSRCFOLDER    wildcard LOCALPATHexternalProjectFilessrc.cpp  LOCALCINCLUDES  LOCALPATHexternalProjectFilesinclude  LOCALSRCFILES   projectLibNDK.c LOCALSRCFILES   LIBRARYSRCFOLDERLOCALPATH  LOCALLDLIBS     LSYSROOTusrlib llog landroid LOCALCFLAGS      Wnomultichar DANDROID DLIBDIRc  LOCALCFLAGS      DUSETCPLOOPBACK DMDNSUDSSERVERPATHvarrunmdnsd DINLIBRARY DBUILDINGLIBICONV DUSEBONJOUR  LOCALCFLAGS      DXRTARGETANDROID DKSBUILDINGKS Wnopsabi Wnomultichar DGNUSOURCE DHAVEIPV60 DNOTHAVESALEN  LOCALCFLAGS      DUSESNETLINK DHAVELINUX DTARGETOSLINUX LOCALCPPFLAGS    frtti fexceptions  include BUILDSHAREDLIBRARY codepre  pHowever, when I attempt to include the first header in the projectLibNDC.c it prints the error of bNo such file or directoryb. pcodeinclude externalFile.hcodep  pIs the approach that I am taking a possible solution  br Do I have to provide the relative paths in the Android.mk file itself for the files  That would be a bit more of a hassle instead of referencing a local folder of referenced files.brp  pIn theory, it sounds as though I would be able to create a library through the NDK in this manner.  But, perhaps I am not setting up the project properly.  Any aide would be helpful JNI has a tendency to throw me around on occasion.pp  pbEDITb  It would seem that Eclipse which is an amazing IDE does not have any glue behind the references to the linked files that it keeps in its project settings.  If I drag referenced files into the project, there are no physical files put into those folders to represent a linked files existence.  That information is only stored in project settings apparently.  Which is not helpful for the Android.mk file.brbr This means that any scripts or makefiles would not have any reference as to what files are supposed to be included.  Unfortunately, I will have to reference folders and files individually from the makefile itself.  I might leave the references in the project as a hint to their existence from other programmers.  Unfortunate that I cannot design it that way, but that is the conclusion that I have received thus far.p
Negative 129 pUntil now we used version numbers like 2.4.1 for our VB.NET products. We set them manualy. p  pNow we start to use GIT with Team Foundation Service and want to improve the version number handling. The aim is simple The format should be Major.Minor.Build.Revision. With Revision automatically inscreasing for each compile. The Build should increase for each Team Foundation Server compile after a git push we let TFS create a continuous build. Major and Minor should only increase manually.p  pThe version number should be visible in three places 1. As assembly version in the application. 2. In the GIT to find a version. 3. The Team Foundation Service build name.p  pSo my questions arep  ol liHow do I create the above described version number.li liHow do I name the TFSerivce build name including the version number li liHow do I make GIT aware of the version number and display them somehowli ol

Negative 129 pIm having a hard tackling a problem with a Zend Framework 1 application.

Thanks for your answer.  How, then, would I go about unchecking that column header check box in C codebehind  Currently, when the user clicks that column header check box, it selects all the check boxes in that column.  When the user unchecks that column header check box it unselects all the check boxes in that column.  This is the behavior I want.  However, after some operation when the table is updated, I want the column header to be unchecked.  The checkboxes on all the rows will update as they should since they are bound to data.  After operation X for example, some checkboxes maybe checked, others not therefore I dont want the header check box checked anymore.  How do I get the column header checkbox to uncheck  My initial thinking was if I made it public, I could just set it to unchecked.  However, your explanation makes sense and I cant do this.p

Negative 129 pI am analyzing the results of an experiment on a csv file with variables as columns and participants as rows. Before all my data is collected, I would like to conduct preliminary analyses on the data I already have. However, I need to exclude some of my participants from the analyses. The best way I have come up with to do this without deleting their data which could cause problems for me later is to create a new column, call it exclude, and enter in either a 1 or 0 for each participant to define who is to be excluded. Then when I run the the stats, I just do it on a subset of my data where exclude  0, for example.p  pThe problem comes in when I download the complete dataset  how do I get data from my exclude column of the preliminary dataset onto the complete dataset, making sure that all the 0s and 1s are attached to the correct participants I can see how I could just copy and paste if the rows of the preliminary and complete datasets are in the exact same order, but this seems prone to error, and in order to create the exclude column its a lot easier to sort by different columns. Ive tried rbind and merge but they do not work as far as I can tell. Any advice is much appreciatedp  pHere is an example of what Im trying to dop  precodeprelimlt data.frame participant  c1,2,3, exclude  c0,1,0   full  data.frame participant  c1,2,3,4,5, exclude  cNA,NA,NA,NA,NA   ideal  data.frame participant  c1,2,3,4,5, exclude  c0,1,0,NA,NA  codepre

How can I stop some other site posting a link like www.mysite.comdelete.phpid3. I understand that the attacker will have to guess the id in my case.p  pBut in general, how do you stop CSRF for GET data or data in a urlp  pAlso what is the difference between an attacker using an img tag or a anchor tag for doing CSRF and how do they relate to Get and Post datap  pThank you very much in advance and I will really appreciate any advice on this.p

Negative 129 pFull disclosure Im new to home servers and Magento. Running Ubuntu Server 13.04 with LAMP and Magento Commerce 1.7.0.2 on a dedicated home server. Ive already configured my servers static IP, routers firewall and port forwarding, and am running ddclient on my server to sync my routers dynamic IP with namecheap.com my domain name and nameserver provider.p  pWhen I use a static index.html page, the page loads from my localhost using my servers static IP. The page also loads on the WAN using my routers IP and domain name through either a proxy website or on my smartphone cell network. Using the proxy website helps avoid loopback timeouts. This narrows down the issue to Magento.p  pWhile using httplocalhostIP as my base URL in Magento and loading Magentos index.php, I was able to access the file locally with my servers static IP. But, when accessing Magento over the WAN using my domain name or routers IP, it says not available, HTTP Error 504 Gateway Timeout.p  pSo then I tried adding my domain name as a base URL in Magento. Now I can access Magento over the WAN but not the LAN. Did anyone figure out a way to resolve this issue Is this related to loopbackp  pThe only two threads I could find on the issue havent been resolved or updated recently a hrefhttpwww.magentocommerce.comboardsviewthread273640 relnofollowhttpwww.magentocommerce.comboardsviewthread273640ap  pa hrefhttpwww.magentocommerce.comboardsviewthread212885 relnofollowhttpwww.magentocommerce.comboardsviewthread212885ap

Negative 129 pIn a current project I have the following architecturep  ul liInternalProjli li InternalProjImplli liExternalProjli li ExternalProjImplli ul  pThe Internal project defines a web service the interface is in InternalProj and the implementation in Impl, obviously. The external project consumes this web service. As such, theres a dependency from ExternalProjImpl to InternalProj. p  pWe created a WebServiceDummy class which implements WebService, and will be used for tests in the ExternalProjImpl. The question is where should this WebServiceDummy be put p  ul liIn ExternalProjImpl this doesnt create a new dependency. Downside if a new project also needs a dummy, it will have to create its own. Also I like the idea that Internal is responsible for providing the dummies for their interfaces, and this wont be the case here.li liIn InternalProj this requires no new dependency, but it means having an implementation albeit a dummy one in the interface project.li liIn InternalProjImpl this makes sense because the dummy is an implementation and not an interface. However this would mean that ExternalProjImpl now has a dependency on InternalProjImpl, which is unacceptable.li ul  pIn case that matters, were using Spring, which means that we declare in the context whether we use a real implementation, a dummy or a webservice client, which is then injected.p  pIs there a best practice for this   p

Negative 129 pIm working on a mature ASP.NETC application its about three years old.  For various reasons Ive recently begun using the beta IE 11.  However, when I first fired up the app in the browser, I noticed that it asked me if I wanted Internet Explorer to remember the password for this site.  This doesnt happen in any other browser the app supports, or other versions of IE, due to the presence of autocompleteoff e.g.p  precodeltform idform1 runatserver autocompleteoffgt codepre  pIs this skunked in IE 11 which I know is only beta, but Im a bit worried about itp  pThanksp  pEdward p

Negative 129 pIm developing a Design Pattern Recovery tool for my final year project. It is a java based system which can be used in identifying, implemented design patterns in a particular java program. When you input the java program Source code to the design pattern recovery tool, it analyzes the static and dynamic features of the java program and identify the implemented design patterns.p  pSo far, i have been using dummy projects to test the functionality of the tool. But, now i need sample programs with proper documentations about the implemented design patterns to  test the tool. I want to know, where i can find such programs with source code so that i can test my system properly. p  pI know this is a bit of broad question. What  i need is sample java programs to test my tool. In order to ensure the accuracy of the results, those programs should have proper documentation about the implementations details specially about the design patterns used. p
Negative 129 pIve been searching for a while trying to find tutorials on how to make a typical website MVC permission system using user roles.p  pIve done such things using SQL and relations, but in nosql databases, its done differently  i assume.p  pwhat i have in mind is something like thisp  precodeRole objects Roles  [      id  uniqueId,     rolename  admin,     permissionsgranted  [array of permission strings] ,      id  uniqueId,     rolename  user,     permissionsgranted  [array of permission strings] ,      id  uniqueId,     rolename  guest,     permissionsgranted  [array of permission strings]  ]  User objects Users [      id  uniqueId,     username  mike,     password  mypass,     permissions  [an instance of role group, or its id  ] ,      id  uniqueId,     username  jonny,     password  123,     permissions  []  ] codepre  phow could i make a single query which fetches user data  its permissions  is there a downside of using 2 querys, one to get users role id, and then get permissions from roles document.  how are user permissions handled in nosql databases like mongodbp

Negative 129 pI am working on a form that has two pages, technically 1 page, just hiding the second until first is finished. My first task was to be able to validate the first page with parsley.js, without including the elements from the second page. I did this by disabling via attr the elements on the second page. Therefore only leaving the items on the first to be validated when the Next button is clicked.  This works great, unfortunately on the second page, after I removeAttrdisabled from the elements, parsley ignores them and still only validates the first page, thus returning true and submitting the page  without checking any elements from the second.p  pThanks for readingp

Negative 129 pIm working on a universal type notification page. Notify of a customer change or even a change for a time off request. Kinda of at a roadblock thought wise.p  pCurrently I have when a user submits a page for form a or b. It sends a notification to a pending page. From there a mgrsup can update, approve, deny. I currently have a controller that handles the user sending the request and creates a HTML string for their request so it it looks pretty and highlights what a user changed from the original customer information. I then use the string to put in a JQuery dialog for the mgrsup to actually view the HTML form of what the user is requesting. p  pI know there is a PHP function that pulls all the HTML out of the string, but trying to figure out a good way to then allow the mgrsup to then make a change to the string and update the string an update the the db.p  pLooking for ideas more than anything.

Negative 129 pSo a little followup on my previous thread, but with quite new content.. And changes of the situation.p  pSo Im creating an Android app, writing in Adobe Muse emnormally by notepad, but find Muse this time more easyem and configured all files as a Phone, with a resolution of 1280x720. And my test device is a HTC one X, with a screen resolution of 1280x720. Once all code is done, I compile it at Adobe Phonegap into an APK and install that one on my phone.p  pSo in fact, what I write in muse site  1280x720 should be 11 on my phones screen. However, thats not the case. In fact, it shows everything at 2times the size. I can scroll on my screen..p  pIn fact, Ive created a second version with just an homepage and one image on it, using whole the canvas, but Ive made this one exactly half the size of the original thus a canvas of 360x760. Compiled and installed again, and indeed, guess what No scrolling and the image takes up the full screen.p  pBy other meanings Somewhere on the road, my phone thinks it has a screen size of half 360x640 the dimensions it actually is 1280x720.p  pI did a quick test withp  precodeltmeta nameviewport contentuserscalableno, widthdevicewidth,  initialscale0.5, minimumscale0.5,  maximumscale0.5gt codepre  pHoping that it would somehow fit half to whole my screen, But without luck.p  pSo guys Here I am, all lost and got no clue anymore. Who can help me with a working HTMLCSSJS configuration, or if the problem lies at the phone gap configuration, help me over therep  pClick a hrefhttpswww.dropbox.comsd2bmi6u8qlbojdpWrongScaledSiteapk.zip relnofollowherea to download the site files and the compiled APK to test for yourself. Note If you install the APK on your phone instead of an emulator and you got a different screen size than 1280x720, of course scrolling occurs.p  pp.s. Ive made a second test version, with just an home page at a resolution of 480x800 and with only an image on it, and tested it on the Samsung S3 mini too with a screen res. of 480x800, and also the whole thing seems at 2x scaled.. Im really lost.p  pp.p.s. Someone else said Remember, you still got the statusbar. For those of you thinking the same Ive set it to full screen, hiding the statusbar and using the full screen.p

Negative 129 pI want to identify a set of weights for the distance measure in KNN method. I read through the MATLAB help and I found that there are functions for inverse or squared inverse w.r.t the distances weights however a user defined weights must be a function of the form  fnc  where p  blockquote   pfcn is a function that accepts a matrix of nonnegative distances, and returns a matrix the same size containing nonnegative distance weights. For example, inversesquared is equivalent to dd.2.p blockquote  pI had defined the function to provide a random set of weightsp  precode function WGTgene   weightsroundranda,b  WGTT  end codepre  pHowever, when I apply KNN the weights does not changed and are equally distributed.

Negative 129 pThe central process for an app in C I have written involves potentially many reads from a disk file and then processing those reads. The data is then written out via the codeBinaryWritercode to the same output file. p  pThe process is often very lengthy so I thought, if it is running on a multicore machine, it could instantiate a thread for each read up to cores x processors threads. each one would process the data and then write it out. There are no critical sections except the codeBinaryWritercode. p  pIve noticed that when I the app on my machine with 4 cores taskmgr says it is using 25 of the CPU so I am guessing it is using 100 of one of the cores and the app could perhaps greatly benefit from using the other 3 cores as well. p  pIf I use a class codeWorkingcode and a function codeWorking.workcode to do the processing and I have four cores to work with and of course that 4 would not be hard coded Id interrogate to see how many I have and use that number what would I do p  pCurrently I have something likep  precode    Working working  new Working      while bytesRead  binaryReaderref buffer,0,bytesToRead  0            work.buffer  buffer        working.work        binaryWriterbuffer,0,buffer.Length      codepre  pIt seems it would help to move this all to a thread.

Negative 129 pIm trying to extract some data from an Arduino over the usbserialport and to write it into a txtfile. Therefore im using a batchfile Windows 7, ordinary cmd, which sends e.g. a d to request the desired data from the Arduino. Having received the d, the Arduino starts to send the data to the pc. The batchfile reads the data and writes it to some txtfile.

Negative 129 pI have a report matrix with several columns, where each column shows the same kind of data but with different filters. Specifically, Im showing some aggregate numbers, but each column shows it for a different time period one may be daily, another weekly, another for some custom time period, etc. To avoid filtering for time period in each cell expression, I would like to set up some sort of a global filter per column.p  pAt first I thought multiple datasets might be a good answer. I could create a new dataset for each column and filter the query accordingly, and then I could reuse the exact same expression from any particular row for all columns. Realizing that each report table is only bound to one dataset, I started looking for a way to make each column its own table, and just bind them together visually, so that all rows line up and are the same height.p  pIs there a way to do it this way, or should I try something entirely different I could have a global dataset that contains all data and then filter per cell, but it seems a lot less efficient. Here is sample raw data and the report I would like to generate. Is there a way to do this without mucking around with the Date and comparing it to Today in every single cellp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com5uuQp.jpg altRaw data and desired reportp

Negative 129 pWe are using NSCache for UIImages in our app. This works fine on iOS versions smaller than 7. When a memory warning occurs, NSCache releases objects as intended.

Negative 129 pIf Im not mistaken, the VBA command CreateObjectOBJNAME first checks if it can find the objects path in the Activation Context, and if it doesnt find it there, it checks the registry. At least this is how Id interpret the fact that when I register a new path in the registry, CreateObject still uses the previous path. So the ActCtx seems to be acting like some sort of cache. As this behaviour is very annoying, Id like to be able to modify or even clear the current activation context in order to force CreateObject to go check the registry. Does anybody know how to do this in ExcelVBA Any help would be greatly appreciated. Cheers, Mariop

Negative 129 pI am processing large files with Camel. The idea is to split the source file by lines and send each line as an individual message to an Akka component that processes each line as an independent message. The Akka component ends up outputting a file using another route but this is not relevant to this question.p  pThe Akka component may experience errors when processing a certain line and in this case I want to signal the File consumer Camel component, stop reading the file and move it to another location. Since the files can be large up to 500 mb of text I am using the streaming mode and a throttling component and I would need to signal the error from the Akka component and have it trigger the moveFailed option in the File consumer, however I cant get this to work.p  pHere is my routep  precode    ltroute idsplitFile gt         ltfrom urifileCtmpintestpreMovestagingampampmove.doneampampmoveFailed.errorampampreadLockchangedampampreadLockCheckInterval1500gt         ltsplit streamingtrue stopOnExceptiontrue shareUnitOfWorktrue gt             lttokenize tokenrn group1gt             ltsetHeader headerNameCamelSplitIndexgt lt line number basically gt                 ltsimplegtproperty.CamelSplitIndexltsimplegt             ltsetHeadergt             ltsetHeader headerNameCamelSplitCompletegt lt did I read the last line gt                 ltsimplegtproperty.CamelSplitCompleteltsimplegt             ltsetHeadergt             ltthrottle timePeriodMillis1000gt                 ltconstantgt850ltconstantgt                 ltto urivmPROCESSORRECEIVERgt             ltthrottlegt         ltsplitgt     ltroutegt codepre  pThen in Akka when I have an error Im reporting it following a hrefhttpdoc.akka.iodocsakkasnapshotscalacamel.html relnofollowthese guidelinesa at Delivery Acknowledgement like thisp  ul liThere is a AkkaCamel Actor with Consumer bound to vmPROCESSORRECEIVERli liInside its receive method this actor does ul lisender  Ack if successfulli lisender  akka.actor.Status.FailureChannelException if not successfulli ulli ul  pWhat Im seeing is, I get a detailed log from o.a.c.p.DefaultErrorHandler Failed delivery for MessageId ... on ExchangeId ...  which includes a Message History and a detail of information on the Exchange. So my akka.actor.Status.Failure message does seem to get to the Camel runtime but the input file does not stop processing, i.e., all the content from the input file is sent to my vmPROCESSORRECEIVER component and the file is eventually moved to staging.done.p  pAgain what I want to happen is that the component stops sending content to vmPROCESSORRECEIVER and the file gets moved to staging.error.p  pIve tried variations on the route, including specifying consumer.bridgeErrorHandlertrue on the File URI options, adding an onException tag on the route declaration. But I havent been able to get my desired behaviour.p  pTo sum up the question is How can I stop streaming content and trigger the moveFailed option in the File consumer from the destination of the route particularly when the destination is an Akka Camel component.p

Negative 129 pIm trying to create DU cases from strings. The only way I can see doing this is by enumerating over the DU cases via codeMicrosoft.FSharp.Reflection.FSharpType.GetUnionCasescode and then picking the codeUnionCasecode that matches the string by using code.Namecode and then making the actual DU case out of that by using codeFSharpValue.MakeUnioncode.p  pIsnt there an easiermore elegant way of doing this In my scenario I have a DU with a couple of hundred cases for keywords.

Please verify if my thinking is correct.p  pCloudFlare account1  caching for www.mysite.com main domain for my app which would cache css,js, and whatever is static on the websitep  pCloudFlare account2  caching for smthsmth.myaccountname.s3.amazon.com caching for images so that I dont have to pay too much to amazon for transfering my imagesp  pOr it should be done in some other mannerp

Negative 129 pIntellij IDEA automatically chain packages together if the intermediate ones are otherwise empty. It is a nice feature in general. However, sometimes you dont want them to be chained, especially when you are in the middle of creating new package structures for your new project. I might have come across the setting for disabling this feature for a certain package, but I cant find it where now. So, does anyone know how to control this feature Thank you very much.p  pBTW, in case you need clarification, what I mean by package chaining is as follows. Suppose you have this package structurep  precode tree com com  company      project          some              feature codepre  pSince there are really nothing else inside the intermediate folders, Intellij IDEA will automatically display it likep  precodecom.company.project.some.feature codepre  pin the project explorer, which looks like the packages are chained together.p

The problem is that, if the future position intersects two rectangles, the circle will bounce in both rectangles  even if the actual circle movement is blocked by another rectangle and it cant reach the second one.p  pstrongUpdatestrong Note that this problem only occurs when the up arrow is being hold due to the rect creation order.p  hr  pstrongHeres the relevant javascript codestrongp  precode                rects.forEachfunction rect   Affect all rects                      Collision detection                      This MUST BE after every change in xvelyvel                       Next circle position calculation                     var nextposx  circle.x  event.delta  1000  xvel  20,                         nextposy  circle.y  event.delta  1000  yvel  20                       Collision between objects Rect and Circle                     if nextposy  heightcircle gt rect.y ampamp                         nextposx  widthcircle gt rect.x ampamp                         nextposx lt rect.x  rect.width ampamp                         nextposy lt rect.y  rect.height                          if circle.y  heightcircle lt rect.y                              clstop                                                  if circle.x  widthcircle lt rect.x                              clsleft                                                  if circle.x gt rect.x  rect.width                              clsright                                                  if circle.y gt rect.y  rect.height                              clsbottom                                                                     Stage collision                     if nextposy lt 0   Collided with TOP of stage.

Negative 129 pI have one question about accessing a matrix position that in fact does not exists.p  pFirst, I have an matrix with strongrowsstrong rows and strongcolsstrong columns. From this matrix, I have to get sets of strongnstrong x strongnstrong sub matrices. For example, to get 3 x 3 sub matrices, I do the followingp  precodefor x, y in productrange1, matrix.rows1, range1, matrix.cols1     bootstrap3x3  npr.choicematrix.data[x1x2, y1y2].flatten, size3, 3, replaceTrue codepre  pBut, as can be seen, Im not considering the extremes, and I have to. For x  0 and y  0, for example, I should consider codematrix.data[xx2, yy2]code the center should be the current x and y, returning a code3 x 3code with the first rowcolumn  0.p  pI know that I can achieve this with some strongifstrong statements.

Negative 129 pWhen I attempt to launch a Pig Script Job from the Hue Pig UI the process starts a job and then the progress bar sits there for 13 minutes and eventually turns all red, with the only output being Please initialize HIVEHOME.p  pMy Pig Script that Im attempting to run is the one from the a hrefhttpdocs.hortonworks.comHDPDocumentsHDP2HDP2.0.9.1bkinstallingmanuallybookcontentrpmchap54.html relnofollowPig validation in the HDP installation manuala.p  pThe Pig Scriptbr A  load passwd using PigStoragebr B  foreach A generate 0 as id store B into tmpid.outp  pIm trying to get the Pig Script UI in Hortonworks Data Platforms version of Hue v2.3 according to their a hrefhttphortonworks.comproductshortonworkssandbox relnofollowwebsitea working.  Im doing this by hand, installing the packages I need using yum and manually setting the configuration.  Im working on Amazon AWS machines using CentOS 6.4.  I am following a hrefhttpdocs.hortonworks.comHDPDocumentsHDP2HDP2.0.9.1bkinstallingmanuallybookcontentrpmchap1.html relnofollowthis installation documentationa.  p  pOriginally I believed that I needed Oozie up and running in order to execute a Pig Job from Hue, but in following the Hue logs I saw that it was launching WebHCat when executing the Pig Script, thus I installed and validated that WebHCat was working by going to httpWebHCat.server.full.hostname50111templetonv1status and verifying that I received a nonerrorneous response.  Thus I fully believe that WebHCat is working correctly.  I must also note that the WebHCat server is being run by the Hue user due to configurations in the coresite.xml that allows the Hue user to pose as the hdfs user when running jobs, this was a previous error that I ran into in attempting to get the Pig Script in the Hue UI running.p  pSo far I have tracked down the error to a code block in the actual Pig a hrefhttpssvn.apache.orgreposasfpigbranchesbranch0.12binpig relnofollowprogram filea.  The code block in question isp  precode CLASSPATH initially contains PIGCONFDIR CLASSPATHPIGCONFDIR CLASSPATHCLASSPATHJAVAHOMElibtools.jar if [ includeHCatalog  true ] then    need to provide the hcatalog jar file path as well as    the location of the hive jars on which hcatalog depends   hiveMetaStoreJarhivemetastore.jar   thriftJarlibthrift.jar   hiveExecJarhiveexec.jar   fbJarlibfb303.jar   jdoECJarjdoapi.jar   slfJarslf4japi.jar   hbaseHiveJarhivehbasehandler.jar   if [ HIVEHOME   ] then     if [ d usrlibhive ] then       HIVEHOMEusrlibhive     else       echo Please initialize HIVEHOME       exit 1     fi   fi codepre  pThe fact that this code block is causing issue is extremely confusing and the error is untraceable to myself.p  pI know that this ifelse clause         if [ d usrlibhive ] then           HIVEHOMEusrlibhive         else           echo Please initialize HIVEHOME           exit 1         fi Is where the error is stemming from, but I dont understand why its not recognizing that that lib directory where Hive is installed does in fact exist.p  pThis is where I am stuck.  I know that usrlibhive exists as I have verified that this directory exists on the machine where Hue, WebHCat, and Pig are all running from.  I dont know how to debug whats going wrong here.  I considered manually setting HIVEHOME, but that would probably be moot since Pig isnt recognizing that that directory exists in the filesystem and would thus error out if it tried to access the path later in the code.p  pAt this point I might be missing something obvious, but I would greatly appreciate any help I can get.p

Negative 129 pIm trying to find terminology or article names that are relevant to the following general concept, so I can do some research on existing workp  ol lipSome remote system has a bunch of sensors or actuators. For example, a thermometer, accelerometer, death ray laser, etc. These are exposed to the outside world as abstracted generic components via some abstraction layer. pli lipA local system can now ask the remote system what sort of components it has, and can also program the remote system to perform some sort of behavior. For example, the local system could send a process graph telling the remote system to read the temperature every 10 seconds and if the temperature is above 0, the system should fire its death ray laser at a random target.pli ol  pThe central part here is that there is some sort of functionality on the remote system that exposes its components as abstract parts, and the remote system also contains some sort of compiler or interpreter which allows our local system to send scripts, programming it what to do.p

Negative 129 pWell I got this program that displays Staff IDs in hyperlinks in which the user can click on one and takes you to another php page called codetask7.phpcode. This codetask7.phpcode page is linked to an HTML page in which the user enters a staff id and various purchase details are displayed this works fine. p  pWhat seems to be happening is that once the user clicks on a hyperlink the field names are showing up in the table but with no details of that staff id. I think the program i created is stuck into thinking that it can only get details for a staff id if it is entered into codetask7.htmcode and not through a hyperlink. What i want to know is how do i run the query which shows all purchase details through the hyper links without damaging the current code Ive created to display the details through user input. p  pbr  strongNOTEstrong When i click any hyperlinked staff ids not only do i just get the field names in a table, but i also recieve a error  p  blockquote   pNotice Undefined index staffID in Itwatwa291task7.php.p blockquote  pbr  Heres the hyperlink codep  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingUTF8gt ltDOCTYPE html PUBLIC W3CDTD XHTML 1.0 StrictEN httpwww.w3.orgTRxhtml1DTDxhtml1strict.dtdgt lthtml xmlnshttpwww.w3.org1999xhtml xmllangen langengt ltheadgt lttitlegtPrac 2 Task 3lttitlegt ltheadgt ltbodygt  ltphp conn  mysqlconnectlocalhost, twa291, ..... mysqlselectdbfactory291, conn or die Database not found  . mysqlerror   sql  SELECT staffID, staffName FROM staff  rs  mysqlquerysql, conn or die Problem with query . mysqlerror   gt   lttable border1 summaryStaff Ordersgt lttrgt ltthgtStaff IDltthgt ltthgtStaff Nameltthgt  lttrgt  ltphp while row  mysqlfetcharrayrs  gt  lttrgt  lttdgtlta hreftask7.phpstaffnoltphp echo row[staffID]gtgt     ltphp echo row[staffID]gtltagtlt lttdgtltphp echo row[staffName]gtlttdgt  lttrgt   ltphp    mysqlcloseconn gt lttablegt ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pHere is the codetask7.phpcode p  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingUTF8gt ltDOCTYPE html PUBLIC W3CDTD XHTML 1.0 StrictEN httpwww.w3.orgTRxhtml1DTDxhtml1strict.dtdgt lthtml xmlnshttpwww.w3.org1999xhtml xmllangen langengt ltheadgt lttitlegtPrac 2 Task 3lttitlegt ltheadgt ltbodygt  ltphp conn  mysqlconnectlocalhost, twa291, ...... mysqlselectdbfactory291, conn or die Database not found  . mysqlerror   gt  ltphp staffid GET[staffID]  gt  ltphp  sql  SELECT orderID, orderDate, orderDate, shippingDate, staffName FROM purchase,  staff  WHERE staff.staffIDstaffid    rs  mysqlquerysql, conn or die Problem with query . mysqlerror  gt  lttable border1 summaryStaff Ordersgt lttrgt ltthgtOrder IDltthgt ltthgtOrder Dateltthgt ltthgtShipping Dateltthgt ltthgtStaff Nameltthgt lttrgt  ltphp while row  mysqlfetcharrayrs  gt  lttrgt  lttdgtltphp echo row[orderID]gtlttdgt lttdgtltphp echo row[orderDate]gtlttdgt lttdgtltphp echo row[shippingDate]gtlttdgt lttdgtltphp echo row[staffName]gtlttdgt  lttrgt   ltphp    mysqlcloseconn gt lttablegt ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pThank you for any helpp

But to do that i need to first fetch a servicesector. In this case however, i feel i need to get projects and filter based on the relationships. Im just not sure how id go about doing that.p  pI hope i managed to explain it properly. Do let me know if you need any extra info.p  pEDIT p  pTo clarify a bit, if no serviceids is passed on params, than i want to check the sectorids. now, if both sectorids and serviceids are passed, i need to filter all the projects to get ONLY the projects that have a relationship to both the services with passed ids and sectors with passed ids.p  pThanks a lotp

Negative 129 pIm forced to use a thirdparty COM component in an application, and Im having issues adding the reference to my project.p  pIve added this DLL as a reference to a project before, but in the past it would link directly to the DLL, such that the Path in the references properties would be filesystem path where the DLL was installed i.e. emnotem relative to my solutions directory. However, now, when I add the reference, the Path is to my projects codeobjcode directory, Embed Interop Types is set to True, and its listed as an ActiveX component which is not correct.p  pThen, I stumbled upon a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryhh708954.aspx relnofollowthis MSDN articlea, which saysp  blockquote   pIf you want to add a reference to a registered COM DLL that contains an internal manifest, unregister the DLL first. Otherwise, Visual Studio adds the assembly reference as an ActiveX Control instead of as a native DLL.p blockquote  pWell, there you have it. Thats my exact problem. I need the native DLL, but Im getting an ActiveX Control instead. So, I did as it suggested and unregistered the DLL. However, when I then try to add the reference, I get an error sayingp  blockquote   pA reference to ... could not be added. Please make sure that the file is accessible, and that it is a valid assembly or COM component.p blockquote  pIf I register the DLL again, Im able to add it as a reference, but again, its added as an ActiveX control. At this point, I dont know what else to do. Microsoft is very clear that I must unregister it before adding it as a reference, but then Visual Studio 2013 apparently wont let me add an unregistered DLL. Any one have any idea how to work around thisp  pemUPDATEemp  pSo, apparently a recent update to this app made COM the only option no directly using the DLL. The fact that it was added as ActiveX didnt mean anything. The problem turned out to be that this was a 32bit library trying to run in 64bits. I knew that was a potential problem, but switching the platform target to x86, still resulted in an error so I ended up chasing a red herring. Turns out IIS Express 8 runs natively as 64bits even if the platform target of the site youre debugging is 32bit. I had to go into Visual Studio options and uncheck the flag that tells IIS Express to run 64bit under Web Projects and then everything ran fine.p

Negative 129 pI have pairs of rows where the first three of four fields are the same, but the value of the fourth is different. However, every pair has a different combination of values in the first three fields than every other pair. The fourth field is a memo field which in these instances happens to be either null or 1. I want to delete the rows where its 1 and keep the ones where its null in that fourth field. This happened because I did a FindReplace on some of the values of the third field, not realizing the field combination already existed.

If I include the WHERE clausep  precodeWHERE FieldValue  1 codepre  pin the above query it returns no results because it evaluates the WHERE clause before the GROUP BY and HAVING clauses. Instead I need it to apply the constraints of that WHERE clause after the rest. Im betting this requires a subquery but cant get it to come out right. p  pAs a related question, the FindReplace operation also created duplicate row pairs where all four fields are the same. In these instances its just like the above except all rows happen to have a 1 in the fourth field. I used this similar query to find and display themp  precodeSELECT ChartNumber, CreatedAt, FieldName, FieldValue FROM [Full Patient Database] GROUP BY ChartNumber, CreatedAt, FieldName, FieldValue HAVING COUNT  gt 1 codepre  pHow can I keep just one row in each of these pairs No, there is no unique ID field at this point.p  pThanks, appreciate any helpp

But I didnt understand how sharedptr is a type of RAII. Because sharedptr doesnt guarantee that the pointer will be deleted at the end of the stack. Deletion is purely dependent on the counter. So how it is related to  RAIIp

Negative 129 pIm not sure if this is possible but Im looking for a solution that would give a similar effect. I have a calendar control on an asp.net C page along with a button.p  pHere is some background as to how the page works When the user selects a date range, there is a post back that shows data and also populates a few drop down boxes with data relevant to the selected date ranges. The dropdown boxes are used to filter the data, for example, the user could choose a specific customer to view data for. After the user selects filters from the drop down boxes, they would click the button to update the page with the filtered data. Alternatively, if they did not select a date and the button is clicked, the selected date range is assumed to be this week. The button is needed because we would prefer not to do multiple database calls if the user wants to use more than one filter from the dropdowns.p  pWith that said, I want to be able to prevent each of these controls from calling another post back if there is already one in progress for the other control. Ive seen disabling a button by doing thisp  precode                ltaspButton ID  ShowDataButton runatserver                   OnClientClickthis.disabled  true                 UseSubmitBehavior  false                 onclickShowDataButtonClick                 Text  Show Datagt codepre  pIs there a similar property for a Calendar control that would allow me to disable the button control Something like, codeOnClientSelectionChanged  ShowDataButton.disabled  truecode From what Ive researched so far, Im not too hopeful that this exists. If it doesnt, is there another way that I could accomplish something similar When I try to add codeShowDataButton.Enabled  falsecode to the codeOnSelectionChangedcode event method in the code behind, the button doesnt get disabled until after the postback is finished, which I should have expected. Without something like this occurring, the calendar control ends up returning codeDateTime.MinValuecode if the user selects a date and then immediately clicks the button as the post back takes a few seconds to complete. Any ideas or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.p

I just wanna know if this is the right way, i dont want to waste any time by trying random values to get the desired effect.p  pThanksp
Negative 129 pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pI have an application that periodically receives large amounts of data from an external source happens to be an XML file and inserts that data into a database.  During this operation, nothing else is accessing the database.  Since there is a large amount of data, I use a configurable number of threads to perform the insertion.p  pThe application uses Entity Framework.  However for this particular operation, due to performance considerations, ADO.Net is used to execute a stored procedure to insert data into a header table Answers and a detail table ListAnswerSelections.p  pThe project predates EF Migrations.  The original DbContext implements IDatabaseInitializer to create views, indices, etc.  Works like a charm.  I just reimplemented our DbContext to make proper use of EF Migrations.  That is where stuff gets strange.p  pstrongThe Problemstrongp  pWhen the bulk loading operation runs with a single thread against a fresh schema created with the reimplemented DbContext, it works fine.  When I use 2 or more threads, however, I get a high rate of deadlocks on the primary key index of ListAnswerSelections detail table.  The deadlock diagram looks likep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comCC8NZ.png altLock Diagramp  pIf I use the original context and create a separate, new schema with it, the bulk loading operation runs deadlockfree with 8 threads writing to the database.p  pIn both cases, a new schema is created for each test run and identical XML files are imported.  The tests have been run several times against each schema, with the same result each time.p  pWhen I use the Schema Compare tools in Visual Studio 2012 to find differences between the schemas created by the original vs. the reimplemented DbContext, I see zero differences for either of the two tables involved in this operation.p  pstrongThe Codestrongp  pThe C code that calls the stored procedure

Negative 129 pTheoretically, it appears that there can be multiple threadpools on a single machine but .Net framework only has a single thread pool per machine even when the machine has multiple processors. strongIs this statement truestrongp  pstrongUPDATE 1strongp  pFrom Tims comment, the answer is that there will be one .Net threadpool per process. So if multiple processes are running on a single machine then multiple .Net threadpools can exist on that machine.p
Negative 129 pIve created a brand new static library project for iOS in Xcode 5 called MyApi. After that I create a Podfile adding AFNetworking as a dependency so far so good. Lets say that I need to use AFNetworking in my MyApi.h file, import . Finally I want to run tests on my code. I start by adding import MyApi.h in my MyApiTests.m. If I hit CMDU to test my code it will complain that the tests cant find AFNetworking. I can solve this by adding linkwith MyApi, MyApiTests in my Podfile. But now when I hit Test it will complain about duplicate symbol OBJC...... on all AFNetworking classes. I managed to get around this by removing libPods.a in Link Binary With Libraries in the MyApiTests target and everything works fine. But every time I run pod install I will have to do this manual step of removing the libPods.a. Since we dont keep the workspace that cocoa pods creates in our git repo. And since this is running on a jenkins server automatically I cant manually remove the libPods.a file. Can this be done in a better way that works without the manual stepp  pPlease dont make this a discussion about if you should checkin the xcworkspace.p

Negative 129 pI have a feature in my web app that allows users to upload and download files. I serve up the app with Express, but the files are stored in a different server, so I proxy the requests to that server. Heres the proxy code using the a hrefhttpsgithub.commikealrequest relnofollowrequesta libraryp  precodemodule.exports  functionreq, res      req.headers[xprivateid]  getId      var url  rewriteUrlreq.url      var newRequest  requesturl, functionerror          if error console.logerror           req.pipenewRequest.onresponse, functionres          delete res.headers[xprivateid]     .piperes  codepre  pThis works fine for all of my requests, including downloading the file. However, I run into issues when streaming the file. And by streaming, I mean I use a hrefhttpfancyapps.comfancybox relnofollowfancyboxa to display the video using a codevideocode tag. The video displays fine the first few times.p  pBut if I close fancybox and then reopen it enough times 5 specifically, it quits working after that the video no longer shows up. The entire Express server seems to hang, unable to process any more requests. If I restart the server, everything is OK. To me it seems like the sockets from the proxy requests arent being closed properly, but I cant figure out why. Is there something wrong with my proxy codep

Negative 129 pI have two codeUILabelcodes in a codeUITableViewCellcode. Both have same width and height.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comsJpJA.png altenter image description herep  pConsider these two labels as a group. I need to center this label group inside the cell horizontally. Important thing to note is that these cells are selfsizing. Meaning the cells height depend on the content inside it so the height will vary. I need the label group to be centered no matter what the height is. The labels must keep that vertical space between them.p  pCurrently I have set the following constraints to the two labels.p  pTop label  Leading Space to Superview, Top Space to Superview Bottom label  Leading Space to Superview, Bottom Space to Superview  Both labels  Vertical Spacep  pAnd the result is this.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comQ0DfFm.png altenter image description herep  pThe first cell, its displaying as I want to. But as you can see, when the height changes, the labels go crazy as expected since the Top Space and Bottom Space constraints are getting different values. I need those two labels to look like in the first cell in all cells.p  pCan anyone please tell me how to do this Is it possible to do this in IB or do I have to dig into setting Auto Layout constraints in codep  pThank you.p

Negative 129 pTrying to create a scenario in phpBB when a logged in user clicks a link or button which I can put in the header file, one set of forums is displayed. When user clicks another link in the header, another set of forums displays. I have a large phpBB board, and need to have it where one view shows 15 forums, and then a second views shows the other 15 forums. This would be good for really large boards.p  pAn idea I had was to set up a phpBB usergroup for example, usergroupF. This usergroup would have permissions set to be accessible for forum view 2 15 out of the 30 forums on board, but not to forum view 1 the other 15 out of 30 forums.p  pSo if a user was in usergroupF, they could see the 15 or so forums in forum view 2, but not see the 15 or so forums in forum view 1.p  pSo, when a visitor first sees board, or when user first logs in, they first see forum view 1. If they click on a special link, they are given temporary existence as a member of usergroupF. For this user, forum view 2 would now be visible, but not forum view 1.p  pThen they click on the link again and their existence as a member of usergroupF would be removed, and they would only see forum view 1.p  pWhen I am referring to a link, I mean something that could be simply be put into the overheader.html file of the theme. As far as what could create this switching of usergroups, it seems like a jguery snippet may be the way to go. For example, I found a simple tutorial here a hrefhttpwww.randomsnippets.com20111009howtohideorshowcontentbasedonlinksorurlsviajavascriptjquery relnofollowhttpwww.randomsnippets.com20111009howtohideorshowcontentbasedonlinksorurlsviajavascriptjqueryap  pAll the query would do is add user to usergroupF, or remove the user from usergroupF.p  pTwo different versions of the script could be created  one to add the user to usergroupF, and one to remove the user from usergroupF. These could be shown depending on if the user was a member of usergroupF, using simple phpBB if statements, so only one link would be visible at a time.p  pThe end result would be a huge board, with 30 forums, could have 2 separate views a user could switch back and fourth between each with only 15 forums visible. This would be good for membership based sites using phpBB, such as a site integrated with aMember and phpbb.p  pI guess the question is if its possible to give a user temporary access to a usergroup, using something such as a jqurey script, or is there a simpler way of creating this. Any suggestions for getting started with this Thanks for any suggestions. p

Negative 129 pI am trying to get my head around a concept which seems to be escaping me and causing me issues regarding simultaneous record update attempts.  I am trying to build a button which each time clicked, returns a sequential text value coming from an underlying table and puts it into a control on the form, while simultaneously updating the underlying record.   At the moment i have 19 records sourced in table tblEffortAnalysis02 of which i would like to scroll through one by one each time the user clicks the control.  In the underlying table I have two columns, one with the number of the record 1 thru 19 and the other with the text value I would like my action to return.  My strategy, which im not sure is the correct one is to update the order sequntial number and then run and sql query which will update the underlying talbe and the form with the text value coming from the corresponding column. It works, as long as i dont mind that the value on the form does not get updated until i exit the form and then reenter. Below is my code.  My instinct tells me that i need to put a type of refresh in there but each time i do it, i get the double user update message.p  precodePrivate Sub Comando50Click  If Effort  0 Then     Effort  1 ElseIf Effort  1 Then     Effort  2 ElseIf Effort  2 Then     Effort  3 ElseIf Effort  3 Then     Effort  4 ElseIf Effort  4 Then     Effort  5 ElseIf Effort  5 Then     Effort  6 ElseIf Effort  6 Then     Effort  7 ElseIf Effort  7 Then     Effort  8 ElseIf Effort  8 Then     Effort  9 ElseIf Effort  9 Then     Effort  10 ElseIf Effort  11 Then     Effort  12 ElseIf Effort  12 Then     Effort  13 ElseIf Effort  13 Then     Effort  14 ElseIf Effort  14 Then     Effort  15 ElseIf Effort  15 Then     Effort  16 ElseIf Effort  16 Then     Effort  17 ElseIf Effort  17 Then     Effort  18 ElseIf Effort  18 Then     Effort  19  ElseIf Effort  10 Then     Effort  11 ElseIf Effort  19 Then     Effort  0  End If  stsql  UPDATE tblEffortAnalysis02 INNER JOIN tblEffortAnalaysis01 ON tblEffortAnalysis02.Order  tblEffortAnalaysis01.Effort SET tblEffortAnalaysis01.AverageEngagement  [tblEffortAnalysis02].[FullName] Application.DoCmd.RunSQL stsql   End Sub codepre

Negative 129 pfor a recent application I want to provide the ability to subscribe to a calendar feed while staying on the android device so going to calendar.google ... and manually adding the http link ics isnt an option. I cant really find a lot of information on this topic. Since it is a completely new app it doesnt have to be ics. Just anything that works ok on iOS AND Android. p  pOn iOS this is so easy as you can just programatically make a call with the .ics link and the user will get a question to subscribe. Android ICS also introduced the Calendar API but I havent really found any clues on how you can subscribe to a public ics with this. Dont think its possible as it just seems to be a way to actually make a new calendar or addchange events but not subscribe to a changing .ics feed. p  pAnyway, I just want to be sure that this is true and just not an option. wich is a fail of Android imho anno 2014p  pThere is another question on SO that is related with an answer of CommonsWare. But making the user install another app together with my app just isnt an option and is to much cumbersome. Only a library of some kind that could make the subscription would really make this process acceptable for use within an app.p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions23091666webcalsupportonandroidnotworkingisthereasupportedcalendarfeedalWebcal questionap

Negative 129 pI am using Guice in a project. Since it is the first time, I am wondering about how to keep and pass around state, i.e. objects that contain some user input or long lived objects that are needed elsewhere not where they were injected the first time.p  pFor instance, my application has a Server which the user can start and stop. Furthermore, the user can enter some data which leads to state that needs to be preserved in memory.p  pAt the moment I see two possibilitiesp  ol lihave a codeContextcode class with scope codeSingletoncode and some references to other classes that keep my state and offer me certain functionality. The codeContextcode class would give me access to the codeServercode instance, to user data, other services etc. The instances of the codeContextcode may be injected by Guice. Thus, if I want to stop my server, I would require the codeContextcode as a dependency and not the server.li ol  pThis goes a bit against the recommendation on the Guice website inject direct dependencies instead of accessing the real dependency with chained getters.p  ol start2 liannotate all classes with codeSingletoncode that should exist only once and are injected in several other classes. As a consequence, I would have only a singleton server, somewhere a class with the user data, etc. li ol  pThe singleton pattern GoF is said to be bad design.

Negative 129 pThere is a mystery that I am trying to understandp  pI have made an application that can be extended with dynamic libraries which contain some code which however need to access some functions that are defined in the application itself. To make it clearp  pI have application lets call it APP, then I have extension EXT. APP is extended with some features that are implemented in EXT but EXT needs to call some functions that are defined in APP in order to hook to it for example register new items in APP layout etc. In MS Windows I wouldnt be able to compile EXT because of unresolved symbols  that makes sense  how would I call functions that are in APP without actually having anything to link these with, so I created a dll library of APP that is basically APP just built as a DLL with all these functions that I need to access exported using declspecdllexport lets call it just LIB, so it works like thisp  pAPP loads EXT and EXT is calling APP functions through LIB. Its a nasty solution at some point but I couldnt think of any better. And whats most important  it works perfect.p  pNow what drives me mad is howcome this all works on linux without having to create LIB This windows thing is nasty but it makes perfect sense, however on linux I can build EXT even without having to build APP or LIB, it just somehow ignore these unresolved symbols and link it anyway. The whole library contains them, I can verify that by callingp  precodeld warning cannot find entry symbol start not setting start address libhugglemd.so undefined reference to HuggleQueryNetworkManager libhugglemd.so undefined reference to HuggleSyslogHuggleLogs libhugglemd.so undefined reference to HuggleCoreHuggleCore libhugglemd.so undefined reference to HuggleQueryPoolHugglePool libhugglemd.so undefined reference to HuggleLocalizationsHuggleLocalizations libhugglemd.so undefined reference to HuggleConfigurationHuggleConfiguration libhugglemd.so undefined reference to HuggleGCgc libhugglemd.so undefined reference to HuggleWikiUserWikiUserQString libhugglemd.so undefined reference to HuggleWikiUtilMessageUserHuggleWikiUser, QString, QString, QString, bool, HuggleQuery, bool, bool, bool, QString, bool, bool codepre  pSo you can see that the EXT is refering to some functions of the APP but it was never linked to any library that would implement them. They are just unresolved.p  pWhen I load EXT in APP some magic inside of kernel somehow happens and all get magically working. Why the APP on linux doesnt need LIB while windows do need it Why its possible to link something on linux with unresolved external symbols How does it know which symbols I am refering to Does it find them in APP and resolve them runtimep  pFor anyone interested here is a complete source a hrefhttpsgithub.comhugglehuggle3qtlxhttpsgithub.comhugglehuggle3qtlxa if you clone this on linux and run code.configure extensioncode and then make you will see that it first build one of extensions even if there is nothing to link with then it creates the application, and if you run codemake installcode and then try to run it, you will see that it loads just fine and using some magic it fix the unresolved symbols within library during runtime.

By special calls, I mean threading. Running that, the client still cant receive data. And so Ive tried implementing threading it inside the class codeClientSocketcode, but with no luck. With codeThread.isAlivecode property, while debugging, I have seen that the thread stops without me explicitly saying in my code to stop the thread. It does so when Im trying to send data from the server. Even threading it inside my main program doesnt work.li liIve added variables codepublic bool hasReceivedcode and codepublic string receivedcode. With codehasReceivedcode, I wanted to be notified that the code is already inside codeprivate void OnDataReceivedIAsyncResult asyncode and it has received the data. codereceivedcode stores the data received. So far codehasReceivedcode has been only returning false due to the client program not receiving data. li ul  pWith all these, can you see why my client program isnt receiving data Thanks in advancep

Negative 129 pIm hoping someone can help me out with this, Im using a jquery plugin jquery rotate to rotate some elements inside a container, however a new crazy requirement came up and now I also need to rotate the container div, the problem is the children elements can be dragged and dropped inside this container and when it is rotated dragging stops working and it starts acting weird I guess it makes sense as the coordinates system is being altered by the rotation on the container so the dragging behavior just goes crazy so the only way that I can see to keep dragging and dropping working is to simulate the parent rotation by somehow calculate what the position of the children elements would be if the parent is rotated without actually rotating the parent container and position each child element on its corresponding final position, this way the coordinates system does not get broken and the drag and drop of the children remains working as expected.p  pTo clarify what Im trying to achieve lets suppose the container is 400x400px and that it has a children at top0 and left0, I would like to perform a fake 180 degrees rotation on the container that would send the child element to top400px and left400px which is where the child element would visually end up being if the parent is rotated, Im hoping there is   a library I can use to perform this math math is not my thing though on each children and somehow calculate or determine the position they should have within the container if it is rotated 180 degrees and then position each children where they should be the container rotation will always be a 180 degrees rotation which means it will be either at a normal angle of 0 degrees or a flipped angle of 180 degrees.p  pAny help would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 129 pI recently updated an app to be configured with backend server at Parse.  They login using either username, twitter credentials, or Facebook credentials.  From there, they can make some posts, which just add a row to an object I have set up in the Parse dashboard.  p  pI know that Parse has some push notification capabilities, but I was wondering about one specific use.  Is there a way for a user to follow another user, and receive a codePush Notificationcode every time that user posts something  If so, is that something that can be handled via Native Parse and iOS functions, or must codeCloudCodecode be set up for thatp

Both needed to place at equidistance width from the centre of the UIView bold vertical line is centre of the view. Also I have to apply to constraint in such a way that distance between the button will be automatically adjusted. for e.g. the distance should be 25 of the device width. If my device width is 320 the distance between the button is 80 pixels and so on. p  pstrongSolutionI have tried strong For above problem I tried on solution . As shown in the figure I have added on dummy view in the UIView the width of the dummy view is equal to spacing between two buttons.

Horizontal centre of the UIView  2.Width equals to the UIView width with 0.25 as a multipliercode p  pstrongQuestionstrong  above solution is working perfectly for me .

Negative 129 pIm trying to use the neural network in Matlab to predict if a produced batch is going to pass some test. For doing so I have the input variables temperature, kilograms of colorant used, material etcand the output, a numerical value that tells me how good it is. First I want to train the network and then use it to predict the result for new batches. p  pThe problem arises when I need to enter the material, color etc of the batch, because those are strings and they have to stay like that, in other words, they are groups and not continuous values.  I read that it is possible to change the words to their numerical representation, but that it will give an order based on how close are the numbers, and that does not represent how related are the word in real life. For example, the batches that are made of cotton are better than those made of silk, and I want to have that observation in the neural network.p  pIs it possible to let the string a string, or to let the groups apartp

Which cause quite a problem when I want to validate the token in my custom assertion validator class. I use the default SamlSecurityTokenHandler and I get an error on the ValidateToken method strongID4220 The SAML Assertion is either not signed or the signatures KeyIdentifier cannot be resolved to a SecurityTokenstrong.p  pI know I could create my own implementation and override the method, but it would create a gap with the standard and I could easily forget something in the validation process I think.p  pWould you suggest me to do that or to find a local STS that can sign the SAML token I searched but found nothing yet  p

Negative 129 pI am using XStream for oxm Java Objects to xml.  NameCoder uses underscore as the default escape character more info below and since I have extdata as an xml tag, it is being written as extdata.p  pXStream maps Java class names and field names to XML tags or attributes. Unfortunately this mapping cannot be 11, since some characters used for identifiers in Java are invalid in XML names. Therefore XStream uses anXmlFriendlyNameCoder to replace these characters with a replacement. By default this NameCoder uses an underscore as escape character and has therefore to escape the underscore itself also. You may provide a different configured instance of the XmlFriendlyNameCoder or a complete different implementation like theNoNameCoder to prevent name coding at all. However it is your responsibility then to ensure, that the resulting names are valid for XML. a hrefhttpxstream.codehaus.orgfaq.html relnofollowhttpxstream.codehaus.orgfaq.htmlap  pI have attempted providing a different configured instance of XMLFriendlyNameCoder using various implementations of HierarchicalStreamDriver as well as using a complete different implementation of NoNameCoder.  Although the app runs successfully, the results remain unchanged.

Negative 129 pI have a server, LAMP, set up and a CakePHP App. When I request a web page through any web browser, it always replies with a 304 status, serving old pages even after i have changed the page. It seems like the server keeps any previously accessed page in a cache and serves it back to anybody that request it afterwards. E.g User X logs into this system and access the page home and logs out. When a different user Y logs into the system, he is going to see Xs home whereas he is supposed to access his home page with his name displayed. Instead he sees it as X has previously accessed it. When I completely delete a resource, say home page, it can still be accessed. I have checked and the pages are served with a 304 not modified status code However I failed to modify this behavior in my apache Settings I am a newbie and I am out of solutions. Any help would be much appreciated here.p

Negative 129 pBased on my research the purpose of a salt is to defeat the use of a rainbow table.

Suppose we have the following scenariop  pI am a malicious hacker and I want to gain access to a rich persons bank account. I am able to gain access to the banks database which has the salt and the hashed string in plain sight, which is a function of the users password and salt fpassword  salt. The salt is codefsd88code. Next I get a rainbow table from some hacker on the web. Great, so I am all ready to become rich and move to Switzerland. p  pWhat I do next is I take the the hashed string and look it up on the rainbow table according to a tutorial online this takes about an hour to do. The rainbow table look up then returns passwfsd88. Since I know the salt is fsd88. I now know what the password is Its passwp  pWhat is wrong with my mental model of a salt Thanks for reading.p

Negative 129 pI recently started using the protobufnet library as a way to get around the lack of binary serialization in .Net Core on Windows Phone 8.1 for a port of an existing game.p  pSo far protobufnet has been working great for me. However when I came to submit the app it is failing the certification tests. The report lists various methods and classes belonging in the protobufnet dll as being unsupported APIs.p  pAn example from this report isp  pThis API is not supported for this application type  ApiSystem.Reflection.Emit.Label. ModuleMSCORLIB, PUBLICKEYTOKEN7CEC85D7BEA7798E. Fileprotobufnet.dll. This API is not supported for this application type  ApiSystem.Reflection.Emit.DynamicMethod. ModuleMSCORLIB, PUBLICKEYTOKEN7CEC85D7BEA7798E. Fileprotobufnet.dll. This API is not supported for this application type  ApiSystem.Reflection.Emit.ILGenerator. ModuleMSCORLIB, PUBLICKEYTOKEN7CEC85D7BEA7798E. Fileprotobufnet.dll. This API is not supported for this application type  ApiSystem.Reflection.Emit.LocalBuilder. ModuleMSCORLIB, PUBLICKEYTOKEN7CEC85D7BEA7798E. Fileprotobufnet.dll. This API is not supported for this application type  ApiSystem.Reflection.MemberTypes. ModuleMSCORLIB, PUBLICKEYTOKEN7CEC85D7BEA7798E. Fileprotobufnet.dll.p  pThere are many more but I have left them out for brevity. However as far as I can tell the MSDN documentation states that each of these APIs strongAREstrong supported on Windows Phone 8.1. Certainly in my own tests the library has been working correctly on device for some weeks when deploying from Visual Studio.p  pIs anyone aware of any steps that I could be missing here, some flag that needs setting in the package manifest or something like that Or could I be using an incorrect version of protobufnet I built the dll from the WindowsPhone8.0 projectp  pThanksp  pTomp

So driver 3 deserves the next booking.p  pHere is the SQL Fiddle a hrefhttpsqlfiddle.com9aa08b6 relnofollowhttpsqlfiddle.com9aa08b6ap  precodeSELECT tmp.driverid,         tmp.bookingtime  FROM  SELECT driverid,                bookingtime         FROM   bookings          GROUP BY driverid         ORDER  BY bookingtime DESC tmp  GROUP  BY tmp.driverid  ORDER  BY tmp.bookingtime ASC  LIMIT  1  codepre  pIt works and I get the expected outputp  precode3           20150624 104718 codepre  pI need some better solution. I do not like the sub query. The table and query above is just for simple example. The original detailed business logic and query is way more complex. So I want to make this part simpler if possible.p  pThe main issue is when GROUP BY in sql comment is applied it does not honor the ORDER BY clause. In other words, the GROUP BY is applied before applying the ordering. To overcome this I do a order by bookingtime DESC in sub query, then apply the group by and order it back by bookingtime ASC.p  pIs it possible to achieve it without doing a sub queryp

Negative 129 pIm developing a custom plugin for myself to use in Monaca. I added the plugin to my project and built it with some errors. Afterwards I changed some code and pushed the plugin to github. I deleted the plugin from Monaca and installed it again, but Monaca still seems to build the old version of the plugin, since it gives the same errors regarding the erroneous plugin code.p  pHow can I make sure Monaca updates the sources inside the platform folder accordingly, whenever I add or remove a pluginp  pThanks.p

Negative 129 pI have a question regarding implementation of hadoop in one of my projects. Basically the requirement is that, we receive buch of logs on daily basis containing information regarding videosWhen it was played, when it stopped, which user playe it etc.p  pWhat we have to do is analyze these files and return stats data in response to an HTTP request. Example request a hrefhttpsomesiterequestDatastartDatesomeDateampendDateanotherDate relnofollowhttpsomesiterequestDatastartDatesomeDateampendDateanotherDatea. Basically this request asks for count of all videos played between a date Range. p  pMy question is can we use hadoop to solve this p  pI have read in various articles hadoop is not real time. So to approach this scenario should i use hadoop in conjunction with MySQLp  pstrongWhat i have thought of doing is to write a MapReduce job and store count for each video for each day in mysql.strong The hadoop job can be scheduled to run like once a day. Mysql data can then be used to serve the request in real time.p  pIs this approach correct Is hive useful in this in any way Please provide some guidance on this.p
Negative 129 pInitial situation in Windows 7 apparently the same in 8.1 and 10p  ol liCreate a persistent  network drive mapping a.k.a. Reconnect at logon.li liNow physically disconnect from the network folder unplug the cable or shut down the target systemli liLog off and on again. A balloon message will tell Could not reconnect all network drives, but the drive will still be visible in the Explorer with a red cross.li ol  pAt this point Id like to remove that network drive by code from my application. p  pFor this Im using WNetCancelConnection2 which works fine with any other situation, but to make it easier for you to reproduce you can also use the command line. Run the commandp  precodenet use Z delete codepre  por whatever drive letter youve used. Itll tell you that it was completed successfully. Running net use will show no network drives connected. HOWEVER, in the Explorer the drive is still there Rightclicking it now and choosing to disconnect will result in an error. To remove that drive one has to log off and on again or to kill explorer.exe and run it again.p  pInterestingly, if instead of removing the drive by code or command line you rightclick it in the explorer and disconnect it from there it works flawlessly So that rightclick option does something differently than net use and the mentioned API call. Id really like to know emwhatem it does.p  pSo whats the problem here And how to solve it Any solution in any programming language would be fine. Thanks in advance.p

Negative 129 pIm developing a marketplacelike application that has support for payment processing through Braintree. However, most of my transactions will be quite small, and given the rate that Braintree charges, its not feasible for me to process the transaction every time a user makes a purchase.p  pTherefore, I want to aggregate the payments on the backend, and charge users once they reach X in accumulated expenditures, or once Y days have passed.p  pIs this method possible to implement given that each Braintree transaction seems to require a payment nonce If not, can anyone suggest an alternative solutionp  pMuch thanks.p

Negative 129 pIve been wondering whats the best way to tackle the issue of token refresh.  Im connecting to an API which supplies me with a authtoken, if sometime time during the calls i get a INVALIDAUTH i need to reauthenticate.  So for the naive implementation i did thisp  precodeSuppressWarningsunchecked Override public ObservableltUsergt getUsers      return runCommandAndrefreshAuthIfNecessarynew RequestCommand          Override         public Observable create              return createServiceUsersApi.class.getUsers                private Observable runCommandAndrefreshAuthIfNecessaryfinal RequestCommand command      return command.create           .onErrorResumeNextnew Func1ltThrowable, Observableltgtgt          Override         public Observableltgt callThrowable throwable              return handleRefreshTokencommand                private Observableltgt handleRefreshTokenfinal RequestCommand command      return refreshToken.flatMapnew Func1ltBoolean, Observableltgtgt          Override         public Observableltgt callBoolean aBoolean              return command.create                codepre  pAs you can see im just wrapping the retrofit command, if i get an error i run refreshToken, the token refreshes and i run the retrofit command again, so finally the Observable is passed back to the subscriber. Works as expected. The thing im struggling with, is what happens i a multiple calls are made, for example, im calling getUsers and getFlags one after another. both of them get the INVALIDAUTH, currently both of the fire refreshToken, which is bad. im looking for a rxjava way to manage the calls, meaning after the first call of getUsers fires refreshToken, any call after that needs to wait for the refreshToken to end, only then fire the retrofit command.p  pAny suggestion will be appreciated.p
