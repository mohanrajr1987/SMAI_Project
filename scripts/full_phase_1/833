Positive 833 pI searched a lot about this topic but didnt find a suitable answer, only pieces of nonworking code or ohmygod nonworking solutions i.e. using textViewDidChange, beginUpdates, endUpdates methods or similar cases i.e. using a UILabel  I know that it works but I need an UITextView instead or using sizeWithFont  I cant do that because the content is an HTML.p  pThe problem is simple and I dont know why the answer seems so complicated.p  pIm working on iOS 7.

The best solution for me so far was to use the object tag instead of the iframe. The problem is, that you have to give the object a specific height in px in order for it to change it, so height 100 doesnt work because it only shows a specific amount of the containing pdf  like it does now. I have to install several pdfs on the website, so I cant just take the specific px height of the pdf, I want it to be shown in height 100. Is there any possibility to do that I read that you need to give the body a height of 100 and set it to position relative, but I tried it all and I havent come to a satisfying result. p  pDo you have any idea how I can display the pdf across all browsers so its responsive, shows 100 of the containing pdf, and keeps the header and footer I have createdp  pThanks a lot in advance, Cheersp

A lot of classes and packages renaming is done everyday.li liDepending on how the projects evolved, some pieces may be reused, resulting in a split of a project in several project, the original remains integrated through the svnexternal property.li liWe use keyword substitution for some elements as its a extremely simple way to know for the tester what revision hes testing.li liOur Subversion repository is linked to Hudson for running test suites and promote valid builds by tagging them.li ul  pAll that I know about ClearCase for the moment is that well have to use it through CCRC or via its eclipse plugin version, and that it is highly encouraged that we linked most of our projects to a ClearQuest project for issue tracking management.p  pCould you enlighten us about how well ClearCase will substitute our Subversion, what concepts have an exact match I dont care about synonyms but really about concepts, and what kind of changes could you foreseen in the whole process.p  pThanks.p

That tints everything red within further intervention on my part, but the effect is much muddier than results from the composite.p  pSo do any wizards out there know of some mechanism I can use to automatically composite the red over the app in similar fashion to what the translucent red UIView doesp

Negative 833 pWhen dealing with large collections, which of the following approaches is betterp  pClass SimpleObject with only fieldsproperties and class SimpleObjectController that contains all the method implementations required by SimpleObject. At runtime, I build a collection of SimpleObjects, instantiate one SimpleObjectController and call its methods, passing the SimpleObject I want to work with.p  porp  pClass ComplexObject that aggregates the SimpleObject and SimpleObjectController in the traditional OO approach. At runtime I have a collection of ComplexObjects, iterate over them, calling their methods as needed.p  pIt has been suggested to me that the first approach is preferable in terms of memory usage as all the heavyweight code is only in one object instead of each one in the collection. My understanding was that if we had 1000 of these objects in a collection, that doesnt mean there is 1000 of the same method implementations sitting in memory. There would be 1000 instances of the data, but they would share the one code instance x86 code segment amp data segment. It also seems to fly in the face of general OO principles and encapsulation.p

Negative 833 pI am working on auto vectorization with GCC. I am not in a position to use intrinsics or attributes due to customer requirement. I cannot get user input to support vectorizationp  pIf the alignment information of the array that can be vectorized is unknown, GCC invokes a pass for loop versioning. Loop versioning will be performed when loop vectorization is done on trees. When a loop is identified to be vectorizable, and the constraint on data alignment or data dependence is hindering it, because they cannot be determined at compile time, then two versions of the loop will be generated. These are the vectorized and nonvectorized versions of the loop along with runtime checks for alignment or dependence to control which version is executed. p  pMy question is how we have to enforce the alignment If I have found a loop that is vectorizable, I should not generate two versions of the loop because of missing alignment information.p  pFor example. Consider the below codep  precodeshort a[15] short b[15] short c[15] int i  void foo      for i0 ilt15 i            a[i]  b[i]        codepre  h2Tree dump options fdumptreeoptimized ftreevectorizeh2  precodeltSNIPgt      vector short int  vectpa.49      vector short int  vectpb.42      vector short int  vectpa.35      vector short int  vectpb.30      bb 2gt      vectpb.30  vector short int  ampb      vectpa.35  vector short int  ampa      if signed char vectpa.35  signed char vectpb.30 amp 3  0 lt A        goto ltbb 3gt      else        goto ltbb 4gt      bb 3gt ltSNIPgt codepre  pAt bb 3 version of vectorized code is generated. At bb 4 code without vectorization is generated. These are done by checking the alignment statement A. Now without using intrinsics and other attributes, how should I get only the vectorized code without this runtime alignment check.p

Negative 833 pIm evaluating the performance of an experimental system setup on an 8core machine with 16GB RAM. I have two mainmemory Java RDBMSs hsqldb running, and against each of these I run a TPCC client derived from jTPCCBenchmarkSQL.p  pI have scripts to launch things, so e.g. the hsqldb instances are started withp  precode.hsqld.bash 0 amp .hsqld.bash 1 amp codepre  pIf I start the clients at nearly the same timep  precode.hsqltpcc.bash 0 amp .hsqltpcc.bash 1 amp codepre  pthen each of those clients has a spiked initial rate at around 5001000 tpmC this is basically transactions per minute, then quickly in less than a second settles to a rate of around 200250 tpmC. OTOH, if I wait for a second or two before starting the second clientp  precode.hsqltpcc.bash 0 amp sleep 1 .hsqltpcc.bash 1 amp codepre  pthen each of the clients runs at 2500 tpmC. Waiting for more than a second doesnt make any more difference.p  pThis is strange because client 0 just talks to server 0 and client 1 just talks to server 1. Its unclear why theres such a dramatic performance interference.p  pI thought this may be due to CPU scheduler affinity of the clients, but they take only about 13 of a single core when running slowly 2025 when running quickly. Another suspicion was in the clients NUMA bindings memory contention on same memory node, but the machine has apparently just 1 memory node theres only sysdevicessystemnodenode0, and furthermore each client takes just 0.8 of memory.p  pIt also doesnt seem due to CPU bindings for the hsqldb instances, since both fast and slow behaviors can be seen just by restarting the clients and waitingnot waiting for a second, leaving the same hsqldb instances running across both i.e. hsqldb doesnt have to be restarted. hsqldb takes 48 CPU when slow, 80 CPU when fast, and 4.3 mem.p  pAny other ideas why this could be happening Theres no disk IO involved, and Im not close to exhausting the systems memory.

Negative 833 pIm interested in writing certain software that uses machine learning, and performs certain actions based on external data.p  pHowever Ive run into problem that was always interesting to me   how is it possible to write machine learning software that emissues ordersem or emsequences of ordersem p  pThe problem is that as I understand it, neural network gets bunch on inputs, and recalls output based on results of previous trainings. Instantly well, more or less. So Im not sure how issuing orders could fit into that system, especially when actions performed by system affect the system with certain delay. Im also a bit unsure how is it possible to train this thing.p  pExamples of such systembr 1. First person shooter enemy controller. As I understand it, it is possible to implement neural network controller for the bot that will switch bot behavior strategieswell, assign priorities to them based on some inputs probably something like health, ammo, etc. But I dont see a way to make higherorder controller, that could issue sequence of commands like go there, then turn left. Also, bots actions will affect variables that control bots behavior. I.e. shooting reduces ammo, falling from heights reduces health, etc.br 2. Automated market trader. It is certainly possible to make system that will try to predict the next market price of something. However, I dont see how is it possible to make system that would issue order to buy something, watch the trend, then sell it back to gain profitcover up losses.br 3. Car driver. Again, as I understand it it is possible to make system that will maintain desired movement vector based on positionvelocitytorque data and results of previous training. However I dont see a way to make such system learn to perform sequence of actions.p  pI.e. as I understood it, neural net is technically a matrix  you give it input, it produces output. But what about generating sequences of actions that could change environment program operates in p  pIf such tasks are not entirely suitable for neural networks, what else could be usedp  pP.S. I understand that the question isnt exactly clear, and I suspect that Im missing some knowledge. So Ill appreciate some pointers i.e. booksresources to read, etc.p

Negative 833 pI have been experimenting with the box2D sample project within cocos2D for the iPhone and am wondering if box2D is the appropriate engine to use to make a moving object stick to a stationary object when the moving object is finished moving in a certain direction. p  pHere is a simplification of what I am trying to achieve  I have MovingObject, a dynamic rigid body, that moves vertically against gravity when enough force is applied to it.  As MovingObject moves, it may overlap a static object, StationaryObject.  When gravity diminishes MovingObjects velocity to zero such that it is no longer moving, I would like to have MovingObject remain where it is ONLY if it overlaps StationaryObject.  If the objects do not overlap, MovingObject should start to move back down towards the ground per the force of gravity.  During that descent, if MovingObject at any time overlaps StationaryObject, it should stop its descent and remain in that location as if it is stuck on StationaryObject.p  pI am able to get MovingObject to move per the forces I am applying to it, but not really sure how to make it stop and stay there once it reaches the top of its ascent, assuming it is overlapping StationaryObject.p  pCurrently, I am experimenting with simple squarebox objects but eventually both MovingObject StationaryObject will be defined as very different complex polygon shapes.p  pThanks in advance for any insights andor suggestions for achieving this.p

The only thing that I thought of was Towers of Hanoi, but that can be done in only a few lines with recursion.

Negative 833 pThis is my first post on StackOverflow, so please bear with me. And I apologize upfront if my code example is a bit long.p  pUsing C and LINQ, Im trying to identify a series of third level codeidcode elements 000049 in this case in a much larger XML file.  Each third level codeidcode is unique, and the ones I want are based on a series of descendant info for each.  More specifically, if codetype  Acode and codelocation typeold  vaultcode and codelocation typenew  outcode, then I want to select that codeidcode.  Below is the XML and C code that Im using.p  pIn general my code works.  As written below it will return an codeidcode of 000049 twice, which is correct.  However, I have found a glitch.  If I remove the first codehistorycode block that contains codetype  Acode, my code still returns an codeidcode of 000049 twice when it should only return it once.  I know why it is happening, but I cant figure out a better way to run the query.

Negative 833 pIm just trying to get started with Java EE and related concepts. However, Im having some trouble understanding the relations between some technologies and the roles they play.p  pAs far as I understand, a Java EE Servlet is a Java class that runs inside a server, and generates responses to requests typically HTML responses to HTTP requests, though Servlets can theoretically serve any protocol.p  pMy questionsp  ul liAs far as I understand, I can either write a Servlet class directly, or I can use some technology like JSP or JSF, which will then generateprovide a Servlet for me. At any rate, the Java EE web container e.g. Apache Tomcat where I ultimately run my app will only see Servlets, and will not care how they were created so Servlets are kind of a low level plumbing. Is that trueli liIf Servlets are kind of lowlevel, is there any reason to actually use Servlets directly I have seen many tutorials that explain how to write a Servlet, but that seems rather unpractical. Is there any situation where writing a Servlet directly is betterpreferred to using JSP or similarli liFinally, Servlets need a server to run in e.g. Apache Tomcat. When reading about servers in that context, Ive seen various names such as emJava EE web containerem, or emservlet containerem, or emJSP containerem, or just emJava EE serverem. Do these terms all mean the same, or is there a differenceli ul  pThanks for helping me get startedp

Negative 833 pWhen I launch the Android emulator from the strongAndroid SDK and AVD Managerstrong I can check the boxes strongLaunch from snapshotstrong and strongSave to snapshotstrong so that the emulators state is saved when I close it and restored again when I launch it.

However, I also want to take snapshots of the emulators state during a session and later during the session revert back to the snapshot, for example to rerun my tests. How do I do this There do not seem to be any controls for this in the AVD Manager.p

Negative 833 pIm about to jump into some simple game development with Javascript.

Negative 833 pThis probably wont make any sense, but thats why Im here.  Ive inherited a web site that Im trying to more features like Frankenstein needs a second left arm.p  pPart of the application makes about 10 different API calls to various service providers across the nation to get quotes.  It does this by generating several different URLs and using mcurl  to GET them in parallel. None of these return any html, they each query a single API and update the database.p  pIt takes a few seconds to run, spinning its wheels as it makes the API queries, but nothing in the database is updated. I can see in the logs each of the URLs that was requested.  If I take one of these urls, and put it in the address bar of a browser, it works just fine.  The api is called and the database is updated.p  pWait, theres more  In order to debug these individual scripts since they have no output I use fwrite.  This works when I use a URL in the address bar of a browser, but nothing is written then all scripts are executed via mcurl.  multicurlexecute to be precise.p  pIn short, when php uses curl to execute a script, it wont update the mysql database, and it wont allow me to fopen a file.  These do work if I cutpaste the GET request from the logs into a browsers address bar.p  pNow this software has been in production for a while on the live site, and works for them as expected.  Im doing development on my local machine, and this is where its failing. Its just got to be something very simple.p  pDavep

Negative 833 pI was employed 1 week ago at a company which creates CAD products.p  pDuring the training some days I studied C language and ASP.NET.p  pYesterday, I received an application with TL, DL, BL, and UI arhitecture from project manager.p  pI have a XML file like asp  precodeltparentgt ltCategories namesomething1gt ltlink urllink1 namename1 descriptiondescr1gt ltlink urllink2 namename2 descriptiondescr2gt ... ltCategoriesgt ltCategories namesomething2gt ltlink urllink1 namename11 descriptiondescr11gt ltlink urllink2 namename21 descriptiondescr21gt ... ltCategoriesgt ... ltparentgt codepre  pAfter that, project manager explained me how to extract XML information Categories and Links using TL, DL, BL, and UI arhitecture. But I dont understand good.p  pI will make a summary about what I understood. He said P.Manager that in TransferLayer I have to create two classes one for Links and other for Categories. So, in Link class I will use setter and getter. I wrote like this in Cp  precodepublic class Links     private string urllink    private string namelink    private string desclink     public string UrlLinkz        get  return urllink    set  urllink  value         public string NameLinkz        get  return namelink    set  namelink  value         public string DescrLinkz        get  return descrlink    set  descrlink  value      codepre  pOk until here I hope that I wrote correctly. Now, he told me about Categories class which has Name property with setter and getter and List of links this object for every link, here I dont know how which takes from Link class.p  pIn DataLayer, in UrlStorage class, I have to take a list of categories from Categories class.p  pBe careful, in TL and DL layer, I have not to use XML function or any operation over XML file.p  pin BL layer I will use methods which operate over XML file Add node, remove node, etc. and get a list of categories.p  pin UI, I will implement a TreeView object to show categories with their links.p  pI dont need the other code but I need a complete project which has all four layers arhitecture to understand better. No definitions just examples because I will understand better with examples. Of course, I will create some more examples to know very good.p  pThank you very much for your time.p

Negative 833 pI have a question about some foundational designing of coredata to make it future proof for my appp  pHeres the scenario, lets consider im developing a coredata model to track Body mass index, BMI, which is just one example and it will be listed in an entity named Category.p  pCategory has the following attributesp  ul liNSStringStringTitle       Weightli liNSNumberfloat upperMax    100 li liNSNumberfloat lowerMax    40  li ul  pNote Those upper and lower limits are completely hypothetical and have no scientific basis at all, im just using it for my example ahem..p  pAnother Entity  Trackerp  ul liNSDate timeStampli liNSNumber entryli ul  ptomany relationship exists here  codeCategoryltgtgtTrackercode.p  pUptil here, everything is well understood. The user enters inserts the tracker with the timeStamp and enters the valuecurrent recorded weight, the application then compares if its above or below or betweennormal the preset values in category.p  pWhat If I add another category  Body mass index BMI. BMI compares weight to height.p  pI can easily add them as a new cateogry in Entity asp  ul liName BMIli liUpperMax 23.5li liLowerMax 18.5li ul  pand user will add the track entries that compares the two.p  pBut I want to be able to add weight AND height and not the BMI index it self, this creates a scenario where the user will enter values to two textfields.p  pthe most obvious answer was to add another entry in Category called Height, but then Id have to create a new one to relate that with BMI.p  pInstead, im wondering about a new approach to design the cateogory entity in such a way that the Entry values can be user specified.  eg.  the Weight in Weight  required textfield input is ONE eg2. weight and height in BMI  required textfield input is TWO.p  pMaybe i should create a new entity with the name fields and store the category and specify the normal values number of required fields in this new entity.p  pIts pretty vague right now hope you get the idea of what im asking.p  pFROM A users perspective I want to be able to add customised categories in the app at runtime itself. Like in creating a new category, Ill add the Name and Add fields to the category using add button in the tableView.p  pIn BMI, Ill add two fields Name  1Weight UpperMaxLowerMax etc. 2Height etc..p  pThen when I tap new Entrys to track growth Two textFields should appear based on the count of Category.fields relationship.p  pIs this the right approach and how should i be connecting the Category entity with the Entry entity. I got Fields entity somewhere in the middlep

Negative 833 pI thought this should be pretty well documented, because it seems like a pretty common scenario.  Unfortunately, I find a lot of conflicting information out there and no real consensus on the correct way to go about this in an MVC 3 compatible, unobtrusive Ajax sort of way.  I can certainly hack together something that works, but id rather do it the way its supposed to be done via the framework.p  pHeres what I need.   I have Login link in the upper right corner of the site.  The site allows both authenticated and unauthenticated users.  So, I want to have a dynamic ajax popup when the user clicks the Login link.p  pThis should go out to the controller, and pull back the HTML for the login dialog.  It should then be displayed in a jquery ui popup dialog, and when the users enters their information it should redirect them to the Dashboard page regardless of what page they are currently on.  If they enter the wrong credentials, it should stay on the current page with the popup dialog still open and display validation errors username or password incorrect.p  pIn other words, it has to tie into mvc 3 unobtrusive validation and use unobtrusive ajax, and display things in a jquery ui dialog.  p  pThis seems to be less trivial than I thought it would be.  Any pointers to an example that does this  Anyone have a sample they can sharep  pUPDATEp  pThe conventional wisdom is, if you need to redirect, dont make it Ajax.  However, in this case Ajax is required because I need to validate the creditials and post validation errors without causing a page refresh, or a redirect to a different login page.  I need for the authentication to go through and post the errors in the popup dialog.p
Negative 833 pso here is the thing. Im making an app that uses backboneJS. I currently create a list of different rows.

Negative 833 pLets say I have a method that is constantly receiving input every 10ms, adds data to a codeQueueltTgtcode, another thread dequeues and does some processing and writes to a file to keep everything flowing in nicely.  The reason for this is because processing will take longer than 10ms.p  pIn updating this method with .Net 4 I would start a new Task with the long running option to ensure a new thread is created. Have a codeBlockingCollectionltTgtcode to add data to and in the task method have the codeBlockingCollectioncode call codeGetConsumingEnumerablecode to process data and write this to file.p  pFirstly, Im not entirely sure if I need the Task to create a new thread or not but due to my ignorance this seems the most beneficial way of doing it.p  pSecondly with the introduction of codeasynccode and codeawaitcode keywords I could possibly rewrite this again so that when data comes in, call a method marked with codeasynccode which does processing and then calls codeawait FileStream.WriteAsynccode. Will this ensure that the data coming in at 10ms apart is handled ok and there is no back log I have found that these new keywords dont create new threads but just handles execution in a timely manner somehow.  p  pIn my scenario will this be any good to me or should I stick to creating new threads with the long running Task and BlockingCollectionp

Negative 833 pI am developing an app where a synch with the backend should not block the UI.

I downlod text and image data. So in the UI I want to display the text first and then, for each downloaded image, fading in this downloaded image. Usually no problem, the downloader completes an image download and calls its delegate a Service ala      p  precodedownloderidltDownloader aDownloader didFinishDownloadImageItem id aObjectWithImage codepre  pwhereas aObjectWithImage is my model object with the new downloaded image.  p  pThe delegate will put the object in a notification and post this notificationp  precodeNSDictionary userInfo  [[NSDictionary alloc] initWithObjects[NSArray arrayWithObjectaObjectWithImage]                                                        forKeys[NSArray arrayWithObjectEntityWithImageDownloadedNotificationInfoKeyEntity]]     [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] EntityWithImageDownloadedNotification objectself userInfouserInfo] codepre  pAnd here starts the problem. Lets say an UIViewController of mine will observe those notifications. After receiving one he would search through his array of objects to display for the one in the info dictionary to change the image.  p  pYou see the problem He will never ever find this object Due to the fact, that originally this object was created in a background thread and therefore another MOC, the object references in the UIViewControllers array of object main MOC is always different to the one posted by the notification background MOC. p  pI know how to solve this problem, the delegate posting the notification could search for the object on its MOC which is the main one but I kind of dont like this idea. Its not wrong I think, because the Service also created the background thread, so it knows that all objects received in the delegate methods are within the MOC of the background thread. p  pSome suggestions how I could handle this issue betterbr I really would appreciate any of your ideasp

Negative 833 pIm using PHP amp MySQL to limit access of downloads to unregistered users.p  pThe only options I see to do this are cookies andor IP address.p  pCookies is not a good solution, seeing as its important that a user cant reset their download count by deleting their cookies  as the idea is that they pay if their usage is above a certain level.p  pThat leaves me with restricting the access by recording the IP address in PHP and inserting it into the MySQL database. The problem with this traditionally is that some people are on dynamicshared IPs, and so the count will mean nothing to them, and could even stop other potential customers from having their free downloads.p  pBut then again, virtually all of my sales are from Western countries, and it seems that most people in the West are now on a static IP address... is this correctp  pWhat would be the best solution for this dilemma Any thoughtsp

Negative 833 pcodeUNIONcode and codeUNION ALLcode queries can outperform equivalent queries using codeORcodeconnected predicates under certain circumstances. To my knowledge, this is partially because codeUNIONcode subselects can be executed in parallel and they can thus have their own subplan specific to each part of the codeORcodeconnected predicate, which is probably far more optimal due to simpler applicable query transformations.p  pBut writing codeORcodeconnected predicates is usually much more readable and concise, even if subquery factoring were applied to a codeUNION ALLcode solution. My question is Is there a way to indicate to Oracle, that a single, costly codeORcodeconnected predicate should be transformed into a codeUNION ALLcode operation If there is such a hintmethod, under what circumstances can it be applied e.g. do any constraints need to be present on the columns involved in the predicates, etc An examplep  precodeCREATE TABLE a AS   SELECT 1 x, 2 y FROM DUAL UNION ALL   SELECT 2 x, 1 y FROM DUAL   This query...

Negative 833 pIm wondering about this. Ive heard that global variables are bad, that they hurt the maintainability, usability, reusability, etc. of the code. But in this case, what can I do otherwise Namely, I have a pseudorandom number generator PRNG and as one may know, they involve an internal state that changes every time new random numbers are generated. But this seems like the kind of thing that needs to be a global Or a static member of an RNG class, but emthats essentially a globalem And globals are strongbadstrongp  pSo, what can I do The obvious thing is to have something like this really stripped downp  precodeclass RNG        private           StateType state               this is the thing one may be tempted                                          to make static, which ruins the                                          whole idea       public           RNG                         constructor seeds the RNG           RNG           int generateRandomInt  codepre  pBut we need to seed that good, if were going to create an instance of this every time we need a random number in some function or class. Using the clock may not work, since what if two instances of type RNG are created too close together Then they get the same seed and produce the same random sequence. Bad.p  pWe could also create one master RNG object and pass it around with pointers instead of making it global, which would put us back on square 1, so that classes that need random numbers get a pointer to the RNG object in them. But then I run into a problem involving saveload of these objects tofrom disk  we cant just save the RNG for each instance, since we have only one RNG object. Wed have to instead pass an RNG into the load routines, which might give those routines different argument lists than for other objects that dont use the RNG. This would be a problem if, e.g. we wanted to use a common Saveable base class for everything that we can loadsave. So, what to do Eliminate the common Saveable base and just adopt a convention for how the loadsave routines are to be made but isnt that bad in and of itself Oyp  pWhat is the best solution to this that avoids the hostiletomaintainability problems of globals yet also does not run into these new problemsp  pOr is it in fact okay to use a global here, as after all, thats how the rand builtin works anyway But then I hear that little thing in the back of my mind saying but... but but but, globals are bad Bad And from what Ive read, there seem to be fairly good reasons to think them bad. But it seems like avoiding them creates new kinds of difficulties, like this one. It certainly seems harder to avoid globals than avoid gotos, for example.p

Negative 833 pIn attempting to create a threadsafe container class from scratch, Ive run into the problem of returning values from access methods. For example in Windowsp  precodemyNode getSomeData     EnterCriticalSectionamp myCritSec   myNode retobj    fill retobj with data from structure   LeaveCriticalSectionamp myCritSec   return retobj  codepre  pNow I suppose that this type of method is not at all threadsafe because after the code releases the critical section another thread is able to come along and immediately overwrite coderetobjcode before the first thread returns. So what is an elegant way to return coderetobjcode to the caller in a threadsafe mannerp

Negative 833 pIve finally reached the rendering phase of my second Magento module, but Im stuck again. The module is now almost complete, it has a Controller and two blocks, one of which is called by the first one is a dashboard block, which uses the second one to populate subsections.p  pWhat I need to do now it add this new dashboard to Customer Account Dashboard. I was told to use layout files, and Ive read about them on Magento Design Guide. I then created the layout file and added the declaration of my block in it. However, the dashboard is not modified and my data is not displayed. If I call the extension method manually i.e. myservercustomerstatsindex I get back the snippet of HTML that Id like to display on Customer Account page.p  pAt first I thought that my layout file was not loaded, but I now have the proof that its processed correctly at least, part of it. Heres the layout filep  precodeltlayout version0.1.0gt     ltcustomeraccountindex translatelabelgt         ltlabelgtMy Custom Dashboardltlabelgt         ltreference namecustomeraccountdashboardgt             lt The action is processed correctly, the template is overridden gt             ltaction methodsetTemplategtlttemplategtcustomerstatscustomeraccountdashboard.phtmllttemplategtltactiongt             ltblock typecustomerstatsindex namecustomerstatsdashboard ascustomerstats.dashboard templatecustomerstatscustomerstatsdashboard.phtml gt         ltreferencegt     ltcustomeraccountindexgt ltlayoutgt codepre  pI added the setTemplate action to the layout file because one of the requirements is that the new dashboard is split in two parts vertically. This means I had to modify the original emcustomeraccountdashboard.phtmlem and change the structure of the page, adding two  sections that will be styled as required. Im not sure this is the correct way of doing it, but I couldnt figure out how to add my additional  in a specific part of the page, without touching the .phtml file.p  pI modified the new emdashboard.phtmlem, to make sure it was loaded, and I can see the Customer Account page showing my changes when I enable the action. However, the block that should be rendered by my extension doesnt appear on the page and, based on my simple trap a simple die, to prove the code is executed, the extension method doesnt even seem to be called.p  pHeres the Controller Im trying to call from the block, with the irrelevant parts removed.p  precodeclass MyCompanyCustomerStatsIndexController extends MageCoreControllerFrontAction       The loaded block is setting its own template in the construct phase     Block  ampthisgtgetLayoutgtcreateBlockcustomerstatscustomerstatsdashboard       Some data is loaded elsewhere and passed to the Block      thisgtgetResponsegtsetBody         BlockgttoHtml       codepre  pThe Controller is fired properly if I call it manually myserver customerstatsindex and it returns fully rendered HTML, but, as mentioned in the beginning, it doesnt seem to run when the layout file comes into play.p  pTo summarize, here are my questionsbr   Am I on the right track regarding the override of Customer Account Dashboardbr   Do I have to specify a emtemplateem attribute in the layout for the extension All the blocks I implemented load their template via code theres a logic for choosing which one to use, and I dont see the use in having the template indicated in the xml file as well.br   Once I add a block to the XML file, do I have to alter the dashboard.phtml file to render it somewhere Im asking because I saw the original dashboard template, and it contains various calls to codegetChildHtmlalias name of a blockcode. This leads me to think that blocks dont have to just be exposed in the layout file, but also manually called in the .phtml files. However, this is a speculation, since I dont have a clear understanding of the mechanism. strongNotestrong I also tried to call codegetChildHtmlcustomerstats.dashboardcode inside my new dashboard.phtml, but nothing changed.p  pThanks in advance for all the answers.p  pstrongUpdate 1  20120728strongbr This is the code for the Block that is not rendered.p  precodeclass MyCompanyCustomerStatsBlockUserStatsDashboard extends MageCoreBlockTemplate      const TEMPLATE  customerStatsuserstatsdashboard.phtml      public function construct          thisgtsetTemplateselfTEMPLATE       codepre  pAlso, I made an experiment with the Controller itself.

When debugging, manual calling of my method emReadCurrentConfigurationem executes fine  it cleans the dictionary normally and fills with new values. But in case of event raising it stops. Also, if execution is passed to emclearem method, debugger shows the following message instead of emdictionaryem value emdictionary   Count  Unable to evaluate expression because the code is optimized or a native frame is on top of the call stack.em Could anyone suggest why this problem occurs p

Negative 833 pA lot of Sencha Touch examples I found online, dont really focus on proper view encapsulation. So the Controller listens to every single buttons event even if the button is deep nested inside a view. In other words the internals of the view leak through which is never a good thing.p  pI found one good tutorial that encourages you to create meaningful views that listen to local events and raise meaningful business events etc.p  pa hrefhttpmiamicoder.com2012howtocreateasenchatouch2apppart2 relnofollowhttpmiamicoder.com2012howtocreateasenchatouch2apppart2ap  pHowever, one thing that I couldnt really figure out so far is how to best cache nested component instances. Consider this examplep  precodeExt.defineNotesApp.view.NotesListContainer,      extend Ext.Container,     alias widget.noteslistcontainer,      initialize function            this.callParentarguments          var newButton               xtype button,             text New,             ui action,             handler this.onNewButtonTap,             scope this                   var topToolbar               xtype toolbar,             title My Notes,             docked top,             items [                  xtype spacer ,                 newButton             ]                   this.add[topToolbar]     ,     onNewButtonTap function           console.lognewNoteCommand         this.fireEventnewNoteCommand, this     ,     config          layout              type fit                codepre  pLets say we want to add a method codesetSpecialUIStatecode to our codeNotesListContainercode. When its called we want to do something with the codenewButtoncode e.g. hide it. How would I gain access to the codenewButtoncode instance without misusing codeExt.getCompcode for that Can I set it as an instance variable How is the canonical wayp  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pI just tried this as Nikolaj Borisik suggested. p  precode    this.newButton  this.add[             xtype button,             text New,             ui action,             handler this.onNewButtonTap,             scope this         ] codepre  pThat works like a charm. I just dont know if its idiomatic to do so or if there are any downsides I might be missing. Otherwise I would highly recommend to do this. Sencha aside, its much better to compose meaningful views that abstract away coherent UI parts. Thats much better than leak every single button through to the controller and fiddle directly with them.p  pSo I wonder if there are any downsides of this approachp

I cant understand why CPU time is high, because if my application wait for remote service to reply which is not so fast in fact, there is nothing to do left for application itself. So CPU time should be apparently low.p  pSome more observationp  ul liVisualVM in sampling mode shows that method codeSocketInputStream.socketRead0code is eating up to 95 of time both wall clock time strongandstrong CPU timeli licodempstatcode we use Linux as a OS shows around 90 user time and 13 system time the rest is idle timeli liapplication deployed on the dedicated serverli liremote service is HTTP webapplication also.

In the tutorial you are making a whackamole game. The mole is on a timer1000 milliseconds to move the mole to a different location. When you touch the mole it also moves to a different location. When I touch the mole sometimes it will jump to another location, register the hit, and then move again. I have my code set to register the hit before it moves i checked it several times.

It looks fairly complicated for what I wish to achieve and Im not quite sure where to start with it.p  pI obviously cant use simple javac to compile my java files contained in my module src because all that code makes references to the android sdk as well as a static library shared between my main application and my respective module.p  pCurrently I use the Eclipse IDE to create the inital jar with all my packaged images, class files, manifest, and then I use two separate batch files that call on the androidsdk to create dex and push the dex into the jar. p  pCan I simplify this process in one easy step instead Or is trying to do this  a whole project on its ownp

Negative 833 pIn my iPad app, a hrefhttpsgithub.comdoxxxuniversalcombatlog relnofollowUniversal Combat Loga newlayout branch, I have a UIView subclass UCLLineChartView which contains a UIScrollView and the scrollview in turn contains another UIView subclass ChartView. ChartView has multiple sublayers, one for each line of data that has been added to the chart. UCLLineChartView draws the axes and markers. The contents of these viewslayers are entirely custom drawn, no stock views are used e.g. UIImageView.p  pIm having a problem with zooming  its scaling the ChartView like an image, which makes the drawn line all blurred and stretched. I want the line to stay sharp, preferably even while the user is in the act of zooming, but after 3 days of hacking at this, I cannot get it to work.p  pIf I override setTransform on the ChartView to grab the scale factor from the transform but dont call code[super setTransform]code, then the scrollviews zoomScale stays at 1. I tried keeping the given transform and overriding the transform method to return it. I tried replicating the effects of setTransform by changing the ChartViews center and bounds but I wasnt able to get the behaviour quite right and it still didnt seem to affect the scrollviews zoomScale. It seems that the scrollviews zoomScale depends on the effects of setTransform, but I cannot determine how.p  pAny assistance would be greatly appreciated.p

I dont like here that dates with time part and without it are treated differently.li liTo save only start date as Date object, and then save length of period in seconds, for example. This approach seems quite good  but a have to rework the whole application and possible it will be no very easy to use different comparisons on end dates. li liJust use current one  save nonenclusive end date without time and be very careful during dates comparisonsli ol  pCould someone explain the most widely used practices to solve such problemp

Negative 833 pAfter I push myViewController onto the navigation stack I make a simple network request for some data that populates a few fields on myViewController. I dont want this request to block the main thread so I make it using codeperformSelectorInBackgroundcode. When the request returns I use codeperformSelectorOnMainThreadcode to update the UI.p  pThis approach works fine except for abandoning the request. Say the user pushes the view controller, the network request starts, then the user immediately pops the view controller and does something else in the app. In this case the network request comes back to a nonexistent object. strongHow can I handle this casestrongp  pIve considered a more robust networking layer where each request has a delegate the handles the response. Using this architecture I could nil out the delegate when the view controller is popped hence avoiding the problem of the request returning to nothing. Im not sure if this is the best way to go.p

Negative 833 pI have retrieved records of two users from a database in two arrays respectively. The records are of people who follow other people just like in twitter. Since two users may be following different number of people. So the length of the two arrays is different. i have created a new array that stores the common people  people followed by both users. How can I get  similarity of the two users.

Negative 833 pConsider a Intel Core 2 architecture that has the following core topologyp  precodeSocket 0  0 2 4 6  Socket 1  1 3 5 7  codepre  pEach core has its own L1 cache L2 cache group is like this p  precode 0 2   4 6   1 3   5 7  codepre  p1 . I observe that on some applications, the value of the performance counter L2REJECTBUSQTHISCOREALLINVALID is rather high. On those applications, the L2 data cache miss is also high. Also the RESOURCESTALLSROBFULL is also high and be the main portion of total stall cycles.p  pIs it correct to tell that, for example, core 0 finds a data in L2 and misses, then its L2 caches bus controller broadcasts some messages to other L2s bus controllers to see if the data is in their L2s or not. However, due to the limit of bus bandwidth, there is high contention in the bus, somehow the others bus queues keep being full then core 0 has to rebroadcast the lookup message many times And if thats true then thats why the L2REJECTBUSQTHISCOREALLINVALID is so high Or am I interpretingp  p2 . Is the correct to assume that, putting aside the effect of cold misses, if I execute a loop that has 100 L2 data cache misses on a core, causing 200 L2REJECTBUSQTHISCOREALLINVALID, then executing a longer loop for example with the number of iterations doubled that has 200 L2 data cache misses will result 400 L2REJECTBUSQTHISCOREALLINVALID If not, what would be the reason to cause unexpected nonlinearityp

Combining multiple operations is called composition of transformations. However, none of the pages on this topic mention how to do a series of translations and rotations.p  pSurely, if you can use a matrix to do rotation about one point, it must be possible to do multiple matrix operations somehow to allow rotation about one point and then an additional rotation around a different point.p  pIve tried looking at pages on skeletal animation, but I cant make head nor tail of what theyre talking about.p

Python has a method called on strings to decode such strings. But to use the method I needed to replace codecode sign with codexcode string. By manual interchange and then printing the decoded resulting string, I get the string  which is exactly what I want. The question is how I can do the interchange automatically The answer seems harder than just simple usage of functions on strings like replace function.   p  pBelow I brought the code I used after manual operationp  precoderxD8xB3xD9x84xD8xA7xD9x85xDAxA9xD8xACxD8xA7xD8xA6xDBx8C print r.decodeutf8 codepre  pI would appreciate any workable idea.     p

Negative 833 pMy question is Is there a way to use a CheckBox inside a fixed row cell in a C1.Win.C1FlexGrid. p  pI have a C1FlexGrid with two Fixed rows. It is important to mention here that I am using the C1.Win.C1FlexGrid grid and not the WPF, or SilverLight versionp  pThe first fixed row I have is used for the headers as usual. the second one though is customized to perform some other tasks all is working fine except for one task I cant get done. I need to use a CheckBox inside one cell of the cells of the second Fixed row just like any Boolean cell in the grids normal rows because I want to use this CheckBox to CheckUncheck all check boxes in the same column. p  pOf course setting the column datatype to bool wont do the job for fixed rows. Setting the editor of the cell to a CheckBox wont do also as the editor wont be visible at all times but only when cell is selected. Also, based on my research, there is a CellFactory property that some threads are discussing which can be used to do this job, but CellFactory is not implemented in C1.Win.C1FlexGrid class but only in WPF, SilverLight and Phone versions of the grid.p  pAny ideas on how to do thisp

In particular, codemain.cppcode does not compile because codedemoptrltPrivateClassgtdemoptrcode is being instantiated by codemain.cppcode, and that destructor wont compile because it cant do codesizeofcode on an incomplete type for codePrivateClasscode.  Clearly, it is not useful for the compiler to be instantiating codedemoptrcode in the consuming codemain.cppcode, since it will never be able to generate a sensible implementation seeing as how codePrivateClasscode is not accessible.  codePublicClass.cppcode compiles fine on all tested compilers.p  pMy question is what does the C standard say about implicit instantiation of a template classs member functions  Might it be one of the following  In particular, emhas this changed over the yearsemp  ul liIf a template class is used, then all member functions of the class should be implicitly instantiated  whether used or notli liOr template class functions should only be implicitly instantiated one at a time if actually used.  If a particular template class function isnt used, then it shouldnt be implicitly instantiated  even if other template class functions are used and instantiated.li ul  pIt seems clear that the second case is the case emtodayem because this same pattern is used with PIMPL and codeuniqueptrcode with its checked delete, but maybe that was not the case in the past  Was the first case acceptable compiler behavior in the pastp  pOr in other words, was the compiler buggy, or did it accurately follow the C98 standard, and the standard changed over the yearsp  pFun fact if you remove the checked delete in C Builder, and have function inlining turned off, the project will happily compile.  codePublicClass.objcode will contain a correct codedemoptrcode implementation, and codemain.objcode will contain an incorrect codedemoptrcode implementation with undefined behavior.  The function used will depend on the order in which these files are fed to the linker.p

However, VIEWB is a view, and cannot be inserted into. So I need to get some real data from VIEWB and its corresponding data in the other 2 tables.

Negative 833 pI have a form that contains two elements a codeCheckedListBoxcode and a codeCheckBoxcode. The codeCheckBoxcode, which is called codeSelectAllCheckBoxcode, is used to checkuncheck all items in the codeCheckedListBoxcode. I achieve this via a codeCheckedChangedcode event handler associated with the codeSelectAllCheckBoxcode, so that when it is checked, all items in the codeCheckedListBoxcode are checked, and vice versa. This works fine.p  pI also have code that unchecks the codeSelectAllCheckBoxcode when the user unchecks one of the CheckBoxes in the codeCheckedListBoxcode. For example, if the user checks the codeSelectAllCheckBoxcode, and then unchecks one of the items, the Select All codeCheckBoxcode should be unchecked. This is achieved via the codeCheckedListBox.ItemCheckedcode event handler. This also works fine.p  pMy problem is that when the codeSelectAllCheckBoxcode is programatically unchecked as in the above scenario, its event handler causes all items in the codeCheckedListBoxcode to become unchecked.p  pIm sure others have run into my issue is there an elegant workaroundp

Negative 833 pI am trying to write raw machine code bytes as 0s and 1s in to a text file, and execute it as that through the BIOS.p  pI have some problems understanding, however, how addressing, multiplying, offsets, addressing, operands, and instructions work in combinatorial arrangements, i.e. difference between codeMOV AL, 07code and codeMOV BL, ALcode.p  pI mean it makes sense in Assembly, but in machine code it becomes highly difficult to get the idea of parameters.p  pSo what I want to know is this How can I better understand this There are no tutorials Ive found that accurately explaindescribe the 0s and 1s from instructions in combinatorial correlations or connections between data passing, MMIO, addressing modes, arithmetic, and the like.p  pOn this site a hrefhttpref.x86asm.netcoder32.htmlx00 relnofollowhttpref.x86asm.netcoder32.htmlx00a it tries, but I dont understand this.p  pEXAMPLE Say I want to move 5 in to AL ... would I specify the literal 5 in binary as part of the opcode in binary prefix chained with the ALMOV instruction, or would I have one fixed binary code for each instruction, regardless of value That is what I want to know ... how to understad how machine code is written.p
Negative 833 pI have a Node server which sends streaming tweets to clients as they connect, using Sockets.io and ntwitter. At the moment all the tweets from different users get sent to every client. But each client only requires a certain subset of tweets, and Id like to the server to only send that subset or category.p  pI emthinkem that having each category being like a room, in Sockets, would work, but I cant quite work out how to adapt my code to use them. Or, given that theres no communication between clients, maybe thats not the best solutionp  pThe relevant, simplified, bits of current code...p  pClientp  precodevar socket  io.connectwindow.location.hostname  socket.onmessages, functionmessagespacket      .eachmessagespacket, functionidx, tweet          if tweetisinthisclientscategorytweet              displaymessagesmessagespacket                codepre  pServerp  precode [A function which, on startup, fetches existing tweets and caches them.]   Send cached messages when a client connects. sockets.sockets.onconnection, functionsocket      socket.emitmessages, cachedmessages    Fetch tweets from the stream, and send new ones to clients. twitter.streamstatusesfilter, follow [12345, 345678, etc], functionstream      stream.ondata, functiontweet          addtweettocachetweet         sockets.sockets.emitmessages, [tweet]       codepre  pSo, the codesockets.emitcode part is currently sending every tweet to all the clients. And then the client decides whether to show that tweet, if its in the clients category. It would obviously be more efficient if the server only sent tweets to the clients in the correct category. Given the server already knows which tweets are in which categories, how do I only emit them to those categories, rather than every clientp

I have tried using 3rd party libraries to rescale my image as using a hrefhttpsgithub.comNyx0ufNYXImagesKit relnofollowNYXImageKita or a hrefhttpsgithub.commattgemmellMGImageUtilities relnofollowMGImageUtilitiesa, but have found the results currently unsatisfactory as it does not clip to bounds and there is no way to set the codeUIImagecode to clip to bounds, rather than the codeUIImageViewcode, as well as produce an image that is not at the 2x resolution for retina displays.p

The profiler tells us, that most of the time was spent in codejQuery.event.dispatchcode we tried current latest jQuery 1.8, 1.9, 1.10 and 2.0.p  pWe successfully decreased the time spent in the dispatch function by using the jQuery.event.fix performance optimization here a hrefhttpbitovi.comblog201204fasterjqueryeventfix.html relnofollowhttpbitovi.comblog201204fasterjqueryeventfix.htmla but performance on that test system was still way below what we expected.p  pAfter some further testing, I managed to pin this down on the strongmousestrong used on the system It used strong1000Hzstrong. We switched the used mouse down to 125Hz and voila, the performance was great.p  pOur assumption was, that the high Hz rate on the mouse caused a lot of mousemove events, so we changed the above code to apply an event throttle and only call the event handling every X millisecondsp  precodevar lastMove  0 var eventThrottle  1 ourCanvas.onmousemove,    functionevent        event.preventDefault       var now  Date.now       if now gt lastMove  eventThrottle            lastMove  now           our drag code here             codepre  pAnd it worked like a charme, the performance was great. Even though we only skip two milliseconds of events.p  pNow I have two questionsp  ol lipWe have other locations where we attach mousemove listeners to different HTML elements and strongId like to add this handmade throttle to all of those codemousemovecode handlersstrong to not run into the problem again. Is this somehow possible to do in a nice way in jQuery 2.0.3 Ive seen codepreDispatchcode hooks in the jQuery javascript but they are already after the call to fix which also uses some time and Id like to save that call as well.pli lipI was puzzled by the fact that already an codeeventThrottlecode of 2ms was sufficient to get really good performance so I added a counter to see how many events are being skipped. The surprising result it skips only 01 events... With a throttle of 100ms, the skipped events were in the order of 6070, so strongif there is less than 1 mousemove event per ms, why does this code have such a positive effect after allstrongpli ol  pThanks for any comments, Christopherp

Negative 833 pThere is a main site it uses Drupal, there is yii application in the same domain maybe in subdomain that implements some functionality for users of this Drupal site.p  pIf they are on the same domain, they can share cookie session cookie.p  pWhat is the best way to give access to yii aplication only to users that are logged in to the main site from the same domain How could I change yii application to give access to it only to users logged on main the site Both site are controlled by the same people.p  pOne of the possible solutions I see seems rather complicated and I dont like it in yii application to ask login and passoword, then the script will try to login the main site for example using curl, if logged it to authenticate user it should work even applications are on different domains.

Negative 833 pI have an issue that is similar to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions18818381xcode5codesigningentitlementerrorsthis onea. The solution doesnt work for me and I suspect that its because Xcode and Apple have a different idea about what my Team ID is.p  pI get the same two entitlements errors as the cited post when validating my app.  If I look at the Team ID in my Account profile on developer.apple.com, it says something like F65F8MK8HE. The iPhone Distribution certificate in my Keychain says, S88MMLNF5T. p  pThe entitlement error says that the key value is not allowed and uses S88MMLNF5T.com.mydomain.myapp. If I open the archive and look for the file archivedentitlementsexpanded.xcent it has two lines with the Team ID. If I replace the Team ID with the one on the website, the archive validates. Thats why Im guessing the problem is that Xcode and the Apple site have different ideas about what the Team ID is. Im guessing that I have to delete something to get them to synch up, but from past experience with deleting stuff, Im hesitant to do anything without understanding what needs to be deleted.p  pIm thinking that I should delete the iPhone Distribution certificate in my keychain and let Xcode regenerate what it needs Does that sound reasonable p  pRelated to the issue, I can install apps on my devices and they all run. But all of the my old apps crash on launch. I suspect that it has something to do with the old apps using a different Team ID. So if I somehow get Xcode to use the new Team ID, will I be able to update apps in the store without them crashingp  pThis happens on Mavericks and Xcode 5.0 and 5.0.1.p

Negative 833 pIll try to stay clear. So the problem is I want to change some data based on the cells value. Let say the column A is the price, column B is the base value to compar with like item001,item002, column C is the value for comparing item001,item002,etc. with the NEW price in column D. I would like to find the same value in column B and C, and depending if there is a match,to change the value in right row of column A to value in column D. Was it clear enough Basicly I have 4 columns, 2 times the codes and the prices of the codes. I want Excel to find the same codes and change the price of the old to the new one. The first two columns with price and codes are much longer then the other 2 columns with new price and the data to compare wont be in the same row for sure. p  pProbably there is no simple solution, but would help my work a lot. I would appreciate if someone can tell which functions should I use in combination.p  pSorry for being a noob, have to start learning from somewhere.p  pBest regards, Endre Kalmarp

So this is what I did next.p  precodeprotected void onActivityResultint requestCode, int resultCode, Intent intent      super.onActivityResultrequestCode, resultCode, intent     ifrequestCode  1 ampamp resultCode  RESULTOK              Uri uri  intent.getData         try              InputStream is  getContentResolver.openInputStreamuri             Bitmap bitmap  BitmapFactory.decodeStreamis             ImageView image  ImageViewfindViewByIdR.id.imgview             image.setImageBitmapbitmap           catch Exception e              e.printStackTrace                codepre  pSo here is the confusing part for me. I guess InputStream has the image information Well I tried to apply the face detection code inside this same trycatch. I figured that after image.setImageBitmapbitmap is completed, that is the time to apply face detection. Here is the face detection code.p  precodeprotected void onActivityResultint requestCode, int resultCode, Intent intent      super.onActivityResultrequestCode, resultCode, intent     ifrequestCode  1 ampamp resultCode  RESULTOK              Uri uri  intent.getData         try              InputStream is  getContentResolver.openInputStreamuri             Bitmap bitmap  BitmapFactory.decodeStreamis             ImageView image  ImageViewfindViewByIdR.id.imageview             image.setImageBitmapbitmap              BitmapFactory.Options options  new BitmapFactory.Options             options.inPreferredConfigBitmap.Config.RGB565             bitmap  BitmapFactory.decodeResourcegetResources, R.id.imgview, options              imageWidth  bitmap.getWidth             imageHeight  bitmap.getHeight             detectedFaces  new FaceDetector.Face[NUMFACES]             faceDetector new FaceDetectorimageWidth, imageHeight, NUMFACES             NUMFACEDETECTED  faceDetector.findFacesbitmap, detectedFaces             mIL.invalidate          catch Exception e              e.printStackTrace                   codepre  pI do not know how to change mFaceBitmap  BitmapFactory.decodeResourcegetResources, R.drawable.smilingfaces, options which is for local images, to the image that I think is stored inside the InputStream or is it Where is the selected image I came up with the idea to instead do the imageView layout, since the image is in the layout. I do not understand how that all transfers and works together. Anyway, that code snippet is suppose to detect faces. And then onDraw draws squares around the detected faces. I am not sure where to put it, but I placed it outside of the onActivityResultp  precodeprotected void onDrawCanvas canvas       Paint myPaint  new Paint     myPaint.setColorColor.RED     myPaint.setStylePaint.Style.STROKE     myPaint.setStrokeWidth3     myPaint.setDithertrue      for int count  0 count lt NUMFACEDETECTED count          Face face  detectedFaces[count]         PointF midPoint  new PointF         face.getMidPointmidPoint          eyeDistance  face.eyesDistance         canvas.drawRectmidPoint.xeyeDistance, midPoint.yeyeDistance, midPoint.xeyeDistance, midPoint.yeyeDistance, myPaint          codepre  pAny advice I am very close to getting this to workp

Negative 833 pShould I expect performance gains for using a purely functional style without side effects in Dart Naively Id expect the opposite, but Im imagining there might be more opportunity for optimization.p  pTo give an example, imagine a vector class that could be implemented like sop  pre classlangdart prettyprintoverridecodeclass Vec    final num x, y, z   Vecthis.x, this.y, this.z   Vec addVec v gt new Vecx  v.x, y  v.y, z  v.z  final x  new Vec1,2,3.addnew Vec4,5,6 codepre  pvs an implementation like thisp  pre classlangdart prettyprintoverridecodeclass Vec    num x, y, z   Vecthis.x, this.y, this.z   Vec addVec v  x  v.x y  v.y z  v.z return this   var x  new Vec1,2,3.addnew Vec4,5,6 codepre  pwhich creates one less codeVeccode object. Obviously there could be an codeaddx,y,zcode method to create still one fewer codeVeccode but Im imagining the added vectors as not being constant values in real life.p  pIn the Javascript VM, as I understand it, the extra object creation is relatively expensive and youd rather not create new objects when you dont have to. If this were C, Id expect a lot of Vec objects would be on the stack and Id expect any difference between these two to get optimized away.p  pI suppose the major optimizability gain of a pure functional style is parallelism, which probably doesnt apply to the Dart VM.p

Each image has its own unique map, and only one image is displayed at a time. When part of one image is clicked, it changes to another image, with a different map.

Negative 833 pI am still fairly new to programming, so there are some things I learn from observing but do not fully understand. The TryCatch is one of these things. From what I have researched, the try statement allows me to define a block of code to be tested for errors, and the catch statement allows me to define a block of code to be executed if an error occurs in the try block.p  pI get that. And I have tried to use TryCatch in situations where I was receiving exception errors that crashed my applications. The TryCatch seemed to prevent stop the crashing. But here is my question, is it OK to have an application that constantly catches an exception errorp  pFor example, I am working with EditText widget. I want the input values for the EditText to represent currency, so I applied androidinputTypenumberDecimal. The issue I learned with this is that this attribute allows any number of values after the decimal. This is when I came up with an idea of updating the EditText programmically with the proper format, using something like DecimalFormat.p  pI am not posting my entire code, but here is the piece that I am curious about.p  precode    Override     public void onTextChangedCharSequence s, int start, int before,             int count           TODO Autogenerated method stub          DecimalFormat format  new DecimalFormat0.00          if etBill.getText.toString  null ampamp                  etBill.getText.toString.length gt 0              try                  doubleBill  Double.parseDoubleetBill.getText.toString                 strFormatted  format.formatdoubleBill                 Log.dTAG, unformatted  doubleBill                               formatted  strFormatted                    etBill.setText  strFormatted, TextView.BufferType.EDITABLE                 etBill.setText  strFormatted              catch NumberFormatException nfe                  Log.eTAG, FloatingPointParser.parseDouble error                       else               values in editText were deleted hardcode value             doubleBill  0.0             strFormatted  format.formatdoubleBill                codepre  pAnd here is the exception error I catch every single time I input a value into my EditText widget.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comsPNWJ.jpg altenter image description herep  pSo my question is, is the TryCatch a method for me to correct my errors Is it OK to catch exception errors, such as this NumberFormapException through the life of an application running Am I using this right Thanks in advancep

Any help is appreciated. Thanksp

Whatever is typed here will display under the barcode in between two asterisks and the barcode will coincide with the numbers below when the page is loaded. I have a dummy pattern of all black attached to the backslash presently. In the code39.js file, on lines  357 and 358, Ive added the backslash with the other characters using two backslashes of course. Ive also added the same to the arrays below on lines 399 and 408, but I still cant get JS to recognize the backslash, it just keeps spitting out a 0 on the barcode, which is the result I get when a value is entered that is not specified in the script. Any and all help is appreciatedp  pbarcode.html filep  precodeltDOCTYPE html PUBLICgt lthtmlgt ltheadgt     lttitlegtBarcodelttitlegt     ltscript typetextjavascript srccode39.jsgtltscriptgt

Negative 833 pBeen stuck on this question for a bit and I cant seem to wrap my head around the concept, although I am sure it is a simple one.p  pIm trying to use the built in User model provided by Django in my app, but Im not sure how to implement it i.e., what does my models.py file actually look like Im just starting off by building a simple login form with the Django auth system.p  pIm seeing multiple examples on the web where they import User but never define anything. Like sop  precodefrom django.db import models from django.contrib.auth.models import User  nothing similar to defining User i.e. class User fields codepre  pWhat Im assuming is by importing User, you dont have to define anything, since its already been defined, but when I go to run python manage.py sql name nothing is executed.p  pTerribly beginneresque question but I cant seem to find help anywhere. Any insight would be great in helping me get over this mindblockp

Negative 833 pMy apologies I may have just not been using the correct terminology in my searches as Im sure this has been answered a couple thousand times. p  pSo I know a lot about CSS and HTML but not as much as Id like.

All is well on desktop. Well when I shrink to Tablet and Mobile the element artist name and social links overlap the artist image on the left. As well as the menu disappears would like info on that too if you dont mind Rebel Mouse Social also disappears in mobile size.p  pHow would I code so that the artist name and social link elements get moved to underneath the image instead of overlappingp  pId eventually like to work solely in DreamWeaver and do away with Joomla because after 3 years its beginning to feel pretty restrictive. p  pThank you in advance for reading this I really appreciate you anyone taking the time to read all of this. p  pWorking Demo here a hrefhttpwww.blackandyellowrecords.commcajlegacy relnofollowhttpwww.blackandyellowrecords.commcajlegacya p  pstrongCSS containted inside Joomla article with HTMLstrongp  precodeltDOCTYPE html PUBLIC W3CDTD XHTML 1.0 TransitionalEN                                          httpwww.w3.orgTRxhtml1DTDxhtml1transitional.dtdgt lthtml xmlnshttpwww.w3.org1999xhtmlgt ltheadgt ltmeta httpequivContentType contenttexthtml charsetUTF8 gt ltstyle typetextcssgt lt body      font 1001.4 Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sansserif     backgroundcolor D6D6D6     margin 0     padding 0     color 000    Elementtag selectors   ul, ol, dl   Due to variations between browsers, its best practices to zero padding and margin on lists. For consistency, you can either specify the amounts you want here, or on the list items LI, DT, DD they contain. Remember that what you do here will cascade to the .nav list unless you write a more specific selector.      padding 0     margin 0  h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, p      margintop 0    removing the top margin gets around an issue where margins can escape from their containing div. The remaining bottom margin will hold it away from any elements that follow.      paddingright 15px     paddingleft 15px  adding the padding to the sides of the elements within the divs, instead of the divs themselves, gets rid of any box model math. A nested div with side padding can also be used as an alternate method.      fontfamily Ash         color 000  a img   this selector removes the default blue border displayed in some browsers around an image when it is surrounded by a link      border none    Styling for your sites links must remain in this order  including the group of selectors that create the hover effect.   alink      color414958     textdecoration none  unless you style your links to look extremely unique, its best to provide underlines for quick visual identification   avisited      color 4E5869     textdecoration none  ahover, aactive, afocus   this group of selectors will give a keyboard navigator the same hover experience as the person using a mouse.      textdecoration none    this container surrounds all other divs giving them their percentagebased width   .artcontainer          backgroundimage urlimagesiconsjlegheaderfade.png         backgroundrepeat norepeat         backgroundposition right top     width 100     backgroundcolor FFF     margin 0 auto  the auto value on the sides, coupled with the width, centers the layout. It is not needed if you set the .containers width to 100.     This is the layout information.   1 Padding is only placed on the top andor bottom of the div. The elements within this div have padding on their sides. This saves you from any box model math. Keep in mind, if you add any side padding or border to the div itself, it will be added to the width you define to create the total width. You may also choose to remove the padding on the element in the div and place a second div within it with no width and the padding necessary for your design.  .artcontent      padding 0 0    This grouped selector gives the lists in the .content area space   .artcontent ul, .artcontent ol       padding 0 0px 0px 0px  this padding mirrors the right padding in the headings and paragraph rule above. Padding was placed on the bottom for space between other elements on the lists and on the left to create the indention.

Negative 833 pI am coding a miniproject of sorts about medical information, and in it, I am reading text from several data sources.

Negative 833 pI have very strange problem with Entity Framework and Linq.

Negative 833 pI am building an application that uses the Authorize.net AIM API.p  pI intend to store the codeaddresscode and codeaddress2code that the user entered on my site in the API call. By default auth.net doesnt provide an address line 2 data field so I wanted to enter a custom field for this and use it to store in the database after I get a response.p  pIn perusing the AIM API documentation I found this clause that concerns mep  blockquote   pMerchantdefined data fields are not intended to and must not be used   to capture personally identifying information. Accordingly, the   merchant is prohibited from capturing, obtaining, andor transmitting   any personally identifying information in or by means of the   merchantdefined data fields. Personally identifying information   includes, but is not limited to, name, address, credit card number,   social security number, drivers license number, state issued   identification number, passport number, and card verification numbers   CVV, CVC2, CVV2, CID, CVN. If Authorize.Net discovers that the   merchant is capturing andor transmitting personally identifying   information by means of the merchantdefined data fields, whether or   not intentionally, CyberSource will immediately suspend the merchants   account, which will result in a rejection of any and all transaction   requests submitted by the merchant after the point of suspension.p blockquote  pMy question is, does this apply in my case Since the customer is entering it on my own site Im not technically getting this information from auth.net.p  pIf anyone has any experience with this I would appreciate a pointer. it wouldnt break my heart to work around this issue, except that I would like it to be as clean as possible.p

Negative 833 pIm using a CAShapeLayer as the subview of a CAReplicatorLayer.p  pIts drawing 12 instances that are just slightly moved away from each other for performance testing.p  pOn touch move, Im seting a new path on the CAShapeLayer that is slightly different to the previous one, so that it looks like an animation depending on the user input  touch direction.p  pUnfortunately the frame rate goes down to under 30 fps when doing this as soon as the shape gets about half the size of the iPad screen iPad 3. p  pI tried to rasterize the CAShapeLayer which greatly improves the performance but only as long as the CAShapeLayer is rather small. Rasterizing the CAReplicatorLayer doesnt help either.p  pI would also be happy to just turn off the fill of the shapeLayers during user input but I couldnt find a way yet to have it work. Setting the transparency of the fill to 0 is not helpful at all, performancewise.p  pBut that would just be the last hope. What can I do to boost the performance in generalp

Negative 833 pI am confronting an SQL Server database which contains many codeDateTimecode values stored in emlocal timeem.  Yes, this is unfortunate  We have perhaps 510 years of data, which means that the UTC offset for this location will emchangeem depending on the time of year if the region in question observes Daylight Savings Time, and of course the schedule on which that change occurred may also change, as for example it did in the United States where most of these data originate back in 2007.p  pMy objective is to convert these codeDateTimecodes to UTC time at the SQL level.  Short of loading the entire a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiTzdatabaseOlson or TZ Databasea and querying it, does anyone have a technique for converting an historical local timestamp to a UTC time  [If it helps, conveniently, we happen to have the latitude and longitude for each row as well could be used to identify timezone.]p  pNote for a row written in real time, the trick of codeDATEDIFFHour, Getutcdate, GETDATE AS UtcOffsetcode works fine, of course.  The problem is applying this retroactively to dates that occurred on either side of the Daylight Savings Time barrier.p
Negative 833 p...and its not because the file was there to begin with. I can prove it.p  pThe background is this We have a desktop application which generate WORDPDF documents. The document consist of Building blocks  small classes that produces a certain layout, and which can be plugged into different data sources, and which is dynamically combined together to build up the document. I dont think this is relevant, but for the sake of completeness, Im using ASPOSE to generate the documents.p  pThere was also another requirement We need to be able to change the C code of the building blocks and make it available on production without having to do a release. The solution we opted for was to save the code for the various building blocks in the Database, and to precompile them during the startup of the application When the Application starts, it gets the code from the database, and compile them into separate assemblies which it then dumps into the applications temp folder. In order to prevent the file is being used by another process error, I added a datetime stamp to the name of each assembly  up to the millisecond. I keep track of the assembly version by storing the datetime stamp in a static variable. This way, if the user refresh the application, or open another instance, it safely generates a new set of dlls with unique names, which  in theory  ensures that I will never get the File used by another process exception. When all instances of the application is closed, the temp folder is wiped. And we havent had problems with that 99.9 of the time, this solution works perfectly. It is quick and efficient, and keeps the dlls up to date when we make changes. BUTp  pOur error handling code sends emails to a server, and Ive been getting the File being used by another process error In my error handling code, Ive done the following When the exception is thrown, I get a list of all the Dlls that already exists in the folder. I also have a list of all the dlls that was generated during that iteration. All this information is then included in the error message. This only added to the confusion In all cases, the error occurs on the last file that was added not updated to the folder, with no hint that there couldve been a duplicate file name. Also, the error never occurs on the same file. Sometimes it is on the very first file being generated, other times it happens only after most of the files have already been created. The error also happens so infrequently, that I have been unable to replicate it. Asking the user for more information will be of little value, because they only notice a problem if they try to generate a report, and that can be hours after they opened the application. Besides, this process occurs before the user can actually do anything in the application anyway.p  pThe error message I receive isp  blockquote   pMessage System.Exception An error occured while compiling EText    System.Exception 8 Errors   Line 4  The using directive for System appeared previously in this namespace   Line 5  The using directive for System.Collections.Generic appeared previously in this namespace   Line 188  Cl.Framework.Reporting.ReportWriter.GeneratorCoreExtendedBase.AddContentWithTagsstring, bool, Cl.Framework.Reporting.ReportWriter.FontTemplateTypes is obsolete Rather use the ContentWithTagsParameters parameter, as this makes it easier to add more parameters later on.

I can do about it. Almost as if it creates the file, and then  when it wants to write to it, it causes the error. But this is odd, because  as I understand it  dotNet uses this exact same class to compile projects as well, and Ive never had this problem before.p  pIf anybody have any insight into this what so ever, I will greatly appreciate your input.p

Negative 833 pNormally in depth sensing for 3D measurement in imaging, people use stereo approach using two cameras. But I have seen some applications and they use three cameras for depth measurement. But idea of image processing algorithm is similar. I am wondering why some use three cameras instead of two. Is it because of more accuracy in depth sensing Thanksp

Negative 833 pTraditionally, I used to manually switch between build configurations debug, full release and lite release. The last one of them not only excludes extra functions, but is also compatible with .NET 3.5 instead of regular .NET 4.5 target. Switching between .NET versions was also accomplished by hand, which resulted in automatic closing and reopening of the project.p  pAs the project has grown bigger, now it is time to split it into parts. Of course, manually switching configurations and platforms for a bunch of projects is not funny, so I edited em.projem files and put codeTargetFrameworkVersioncode directive into conditional sections, like in many examples here and on other sites.p  precodeltPropertyGroup Condition Configuration  Debug gt     ltTargetFrameworkVersiongtv4.5ltTargetFrameworkVersiongt     ltDefineConstantsgtdotNet4.5, HaveTestingTrue, HaveDumperTrueltDefineConstantsgt ltPropertyGroupgt ltPropertyGroup Condition Configuration  RlzFull gt     ltTargetFrameworkVersiongtv4.5ltTargetFrameworkVersiongt     ltDefineConstantsgtdotNet4.5, HaveTestingFalse, HaveDumperTrueltDefineConstantsgt ltPropertyGroupgt ltPropertyGroup Condition Configuration  RlzLite gt     ltTargetFrameworkVersiongtv3.5ltTargetFrameworkVersiongt     ltTargetFrameworkProfilegtClientltTargetFrameworkProfilegt     ltDefineConstantsgtdotNet3.5, HaveTestingFalse, HaveDumperFalseltDefineConstantsgt ltPropertyGroupgt ltPropertyGroup  Condition Configuration  Debug gt     ltDebugTypegtfullltDebugTypegt     ltDebugSymbolsgttrueltDebugSymbolsgt     ltDefineDebuggttrueltDefineDebuggt     ltDefineTracegttrueltDefineTracegt ltPropertyGroupgt ltPropertyGroup Condition Configuration  Debug gt     ltDebugTypegtnoneltDebugTypegt     ltDebugSymbolsgtfalseltDebugSymbolsgt     ltDefineDebuggtfalseltDefineDebuggt     ltDefineTracegtfalseltDefineTracegt ltPropertyGroupgt ltPropertyGroup Condition Platform  AnyCPU gt     ltPlatformTargetgtAnyCPUltPlatformTargetgt     ltPrefer32Bit Condition TargetFrameworkVersion.Substring1 ampgt 4.5 gttrueltPrefer32Bitgt ltPropertyGroupgt ltPropertyGroup Condition Platform  x86 gt     ltPlatformTargetgtx86ltPlatformTargetgt ltPropertyGroupgt ltPropertyGroup Condition Platform  x64 gt     ltPlatformTargetgtx64ltPlatformTargetgt ltPropertyGroupgt codepre  pApparently, strongit works with MSBuild launched manuallystrong. Accidentally or not, all example authors wrote about manual invocation of build routine. Moreover, some of them added kind of You select only a single configuration to use inside Visual Studio.p  pHowever, at least in topic a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq18588803Conditionally changing target framework versiona it is implied that configuration emmayem be changed interactively inside Visual Studio the GUI will still display the previous .NET version in the project properties window, but the compiler will use correct libraries. But it does not seem to work for me strongwhen another configuration is selected in GUI which requires different .NET version, the previous onestrong the default one strongis used insteadstrong, even after reopening the solution.p  pThe build output log shows that the very first project emLibUtil.dllem is successfully compiled. However, when inspecting the built assembly, it can be seen that it was targeted at .NET 4.x, as it references emmscorlib.dllem strong4strong.0.0.0 and emSystem.dllem strong2strong.0.0.0. When built manually, both referenced libraries are of version strong2strong.0.0.0 for the .NET 3.5 configuration and of version strong4strong.0.0.0 for the .NET 4.5 configuration.p  pAll subsequent projects have a bunch of similar errors in the logp  precodeerror BC30002 Type FooClass.BarClass is not defined. error BC30451 FooClass is not declared. It may be inaccessible due to its protection level. warning MSB3258 The primary reference ...LibUtil.dll could not be resolved because it has an indirect dependency on the .NET Framework assembly System.Windows.Forms, Version4.0.0.0, ... which has a higher version 4.0.0.0 than the version 2.0.0.0 in the current target framework. warning MSB3268 The primary reference ...LibUtil.dll could not be resolved because it has an indirect dependency on the framework assembly System.Web.ApplicationServices, Version4.0.0.0, ... which could not be resolved in the currently targeted framework. codepre  pNote the warnings for a simple library project that actually references codeSystemcode and codeSystem.Corecode only, the log states that it references several dozens of .NET libraries, including those I even never heard of before. p  pSo, the question is Is it really possible to change the target .NET version along with build configuration inside Visual Studio, or is it only possible when running MSBuild by hand I expected that the experience should be the same in both CLI and GUI. Without the ability to test different configurations in IDE and track errors easily, Visual Studio is no better than a Notepad with IntelliSense.p  pstrongUpdate 1strong. Apparently, GUI behavior is indeed inconsistent with CLI when I tried to use hierarchical codeChoosecodecodeWhencodecodeOtherwisecode style of conditional project description, the configuration manager in IDE stopped recognizing defined configurations and platforms at all, displaying Debug and Any CPU sic as the only option for each project. Curiously, when trying to add a new configuration or platform with a name already defined in em.projem file, IDE confirms that this item exists already.p  pstrongUpdate 2strong. Switching between configurations which target different .NET versions and described in a way that is shown in the listing above, may cause Visual Studio 2012 to crash on each attempt. Unless you want to loose all your breakpoints, etc. by deleting em.suoem file, it may help to unload all projects except the most simple one and then to switch the configuration  after that other projects may be loaded back safely. Another option is to edit project files and temporarily exclude all codeTargetPlatformVersioncode directives that point to a previous version, then switch the solution configuration to a safe value such as Debug, then restore project files.p

Negative 833 pI have built a webapp, a diary app. Users can log in with accounts and createedit their diaries. A user can be loggedin with multiple devices at the same time, so if he changes something, the other devices will show the change as fast as possible.p  pIm using MySQL and PHP for the backend, Angularjs for the main parts of handling the data on the clientside. I am looking for the most efficient way to do this.p  pMy solution is that the server saves for each action edit content, order of diaries etc. the time when the change took place. The devices will save locally in JavaScript variables the time when it updated the last data and send this time via AJAX to the server interval, e.g. 3 seconds.p  pThis will return only the actioncode so the identifier of the action and the required data e.g. new content, new order of the changes since the last request the sent time now the clientside the JavaScript and Angularjs handles this type of action and updates the view.p  pIs there any other solution which is better than mine and not more complicated which can be done with the same expenditurep
Negative 833 pId like to ask whether this is a useful concept, if other languages have ever done this sort of thing, or if this idea is problematic or just bad. If it is problematic, an explanation of what principles it violates would also be greatly appreciated.p  pFor the sake of being clear about what I mean, Ive written some C pseudocode where Ive created an imaginary lazy keyword that provides a concrete implementation of this idea. The lazy keyword instructs the compiler to 1 explicit cast any object that has functions that conform to an interface contract to that interface, even if the object in question does not explicitly implement the interface and 2 if said explicit cast function doesnt exist, create it, 3. The object can be cast back to what it was originally, 4. If the object doesnt implement the methods required by the interface, you get a compiler error.p  pThen the following code would compile and run.p  precodeclass Program      public interface iRoll              public void Roll         public int Dimensions  get set           public class Basketball              public void Roll                      Console.WriteLineIm a rolling basketball                  private int dimensions  3         public int Dimensions  get  return dimensions  set  dimensions  value           public string Brand  BallCo.           public class Tire              public void Roll                      Console.WriteLineIm a rolling tire                  private int dimensions  3         public int Dimensions  get  return dimensions  set  dimensions  value             static void Mainstring[] args              Tire MyTire  new Tire         Basketball MyBall  new Basketball         var myList  new ListltiRollgt         myList.Addlazy iRoll MyTire         myList.Addlazy iRoll MyBall         foreachiRoll myIRoll in myList                      myIRoll.Roll             Console.WriteLineMy dimensions   myIRoll.Dimensions                codepre  pThe benefits are not always having classes implement interfaces like crazy, and not having to derive from a base class just to implement a custom interface when the base class already has the methods and properties you need e.g., certain situations with external libraries, certain UI controls.p  pGood idea, bad idea, terrible idea Do any other languages experiment with thisp

Negative 833 pSo Im working on a project with javascript and parse.com where each user will be associated with a facility.  Each facility has their own number so I have an array with those facility numbers in the users object.  When that user logs in, there will be an array with those facility numbers that I need to make a query with.  I looked at the docs and saw a log of querying with arrays but they didnt seem to fit my needs.p  pI want an array back with each facility object from the facility table.  Heres a quick chart of the class structuresp  pUsercode[userInfousername, pass, etc][facilitiesarray]codep  pFacilitiescode[facilityName][facilityNumber][etc]codep  pSo the user could be associated with multiple facilities.  I need to take the array of facility numbers and get back an array of those facilities.  So codefacilitiescode could be code[1,2,11]code and it would give back three different facility objects in an array.p  pI tried thisp  precodefunction loadFacilitiesuser       var facilitiesArray  user.getfacilities      var query  queryWithClassNamefacilities      query.equalTofacilityNumber, facilitiesArray      query.find.thenfunction results           console.logresults         codepre  pKnowing I would most likely get a code400 bad requestcode error because codefacilityNumbercode is a number, not an array like codefacilitiescode.p  pSo whats the best way to go at this.  I can easily create a query for each entry in the codefacilitiescode array but that is very inefficient. p

Negative 833 pI have troubles trying to integrate Google Play Game Services to my game. I followed the tutorial and watched the video of most 7 errors using google play games and none of them was my case.p  pI have defined my Google services on the Developer Console. After that i have vinculed 2 apps, with the same package name that i have on manifest. I Used the keytool to take the 2 certificates fingerprint. Then, I adde my appid to the manifest only the 13 dgits. p  pAnd when I launch the application, it shows the splash of Google Play Games, asking me wich of my 2 google accounts I want to log in, I select it and then it asks me for permissions and finally when I accept, it shows me a popup error message saying Unknown issue with Google Play Services.p  pAnd the error in Log is thisp  precode0716 154136.578 EVolley30175 [4704] tm.a Unexpected response code 403 for httpswww.googleapis.comdrivev2betaappsselfprettyPrintfalse 0716 154136.598 EClientConnectionOperation30175 Handling authorization failure 0716 154136.598 EClientConnectionOperation30175 chb Authorization failed server returned error Access Not Configured.

Negative 833 pIm trying to decide on the security layers I should implement to increase the protection of specific parts of my android application. In order to decide, Im decompiling my own application to see how easily someone else can access specific parts of the code after obfuscating it with the ProGuard tool. After decompiling, the references to R.string resources become an integer value.p  pI would like to know, if someone can easily associate the integer values with the actual string values or if a lot of effort is required to achieve this. Im only asking in order to see if a third party can reveal this information in no time or if it is a task that requires effort that may put off someone into getting into the trouble of mapping the values.  p  pThank you, L.  p
Negative 833 pI know similar questions have been asked but after trying multiple different configurations I still have not quite found the solution Im looking for. When I run my python file from java it prints all generated lines at once rather than printing as they execute. p  pI have a java program which displays a simple UI, once the user inputs all the arguments needed, I pass this information along to a working set of python scripts. Because the python program is quite extensive and takes a while to run there is a series of updated status messages which will print to the command prompt. In order to test running a process in Java I set up two simple test files.p  pMy test java is as followsp  precodeRuntime rt  Runtime.getRuntime Process proc  rt.execpython u Test.py BufferedReader br  new BufferedReadernew InputStreamReaderproc.getInputStream String line   whileline  b2.readLine  null     System.out.printlnline  codepre  pMy Test.py file looks like edit I added the Unbuffered class as shown in the linked example and still no luck.p  precodeclass Unbufferedobject     def initself,stream         self.stream  stream     def writeself, data         self.stream.writedata         self.stream.flush     def getattrself.stream, attr         return getattrself.stream, attr  sys.stdout  Unbufferedsys.stdout  print Hello World time.sleep5 print Hello again codepre  pWhen I run my java file, it waits 5 seconds before displaying both print lines from the python file. But I want it to not block the process and print out each line as its reached in the python file. Any help would be appreciated.p  pEDIT SOLVEDp  pMy problem was I had to thread the new process outside of my main program. I ended up with something likep  precodepublic class MyRunnable implements Runnable     public void run         Runtime rt  Runtime.getRuntime         Process proc  rt.execpython Test.py         StreamGobbler errGobbler  new StreamGobblerproc.getErrorStream, Error         StreamGobbler outputGobbler  new StreamGobblerproc.getInputStream, Output         errGobbler.start         outputGobbler.start       public static void mainString[] args    MyRunnable myRun  new MyRunnable    Thread myThread  new ThreadmyRun    myThread.start  codepre

Negative 833 pOur current development is in VS 2008 using WebForms and JQuery. strongWe must support IE8strong.p  pFor new projects I would like to start using VS 2013MVC but I am not sure if support of IE8 will be an issue. I have used VS 2013 for short time on coworkers PC and I noticed it includes JQuery, Bootstrap, modernizr2.6.2.js and respond.js frameworks of those I am only a bit familiar with JQuery in project generated from MVC template. Note that I am fairly new to web development and JavaScript in particular.p  pJQuery used in this project is version 1.10.2 and 1. JQuery branch supports IE8.p  pBootstrap is v. 3.0.0 and IE8 support has some limitations as I found here a hrefhttpgetbootstrap.comgettingstartedsupport relnofollowhttpgetbootstrap.comgettingstartedsupporta Are these a big dealshow stoppers Are there workaroundsp  pInformation I found on modernizr is not completely clear. On one hand this page a hrefhttpmodernizr.comdocs relnofollowhttpmodernizr.comdocsa says strongWe support IE6, Firefox 3.5, Opera 9.6, Safari 2, Chrome.strong. On the other hand the same page says strongIf you dont support IE8 and dont need to worry about FOUC, feel free to include modernizr.js whereever.strongp  pAs far as respond.js it seems there are some issues for which people usually find workarounds.p  pAre there any issues inherent to latest version of MVC itself other than JavaScript component compatibility that make it incompatible with IE8p

Negative 833 pIm working on making a large grid using a codeUICollectionViewcode, and I want it to be zoomable the entire codeUICollectionViewcode, not just a single cell with the standard pinchtozoom gesture.  The grid in question has a custom codeUICollectionViewLayoutcode, because I needed it to scroll both horizontally and vertically.p  pI got the layout working perfectly with a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma137003341418688this SO answera, so I had a grid that you could move all around on.  The short version is that each row of cells is a codesectioncode of the view, and all the cells are positioned based on a uniform codecellSizecode of to start with 50.p  pThen I worked out the pinchtozoom ability using a modified version of a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma175182261418688this SO answera, where I basically change the layouts codecellSizecode value when the pinch gesture is received, and then invalidate the layout so it redraws with the slightly larger or smaller layout.  Thus, all the cells get bigger or smaller, and we have zooming.p  pHeres the code for the pinch gesture methodp  precodevoiddidReceivePinchGestureUIPinchGestureRecognizergesture      double newCellSize  [IMMapViewLayout mainCollectionView.collectionViewLayout cellSize]  gesture.scale     newCellSize  MINnewCellSize, 100     newCellSize  MAXnewCellSize, 15      [IMMapViewLayout mainCollectionView.collectionViewLayout setCellSizenewCellSize]     [mainCollectionView.collectionViewLayout invalidateLayout]  codepre  pAnd everything was working almost perfectly.p  pstrongMy problem is thisstrong it zooms from the topleft corner, not from where the pinch is located.  Makes sense, I suppose, since were redrawing everything and its all a little bigger, but its obviously not the desired effect.p  pMy first thought was simply to detect the cell directly under the pinch and then use codescrollToItemAtIndexPathatScrollPositionanimatedcode to move back to that cell instantaneously, but it doesnt seem to be working, and the animation gets superchoppy anyway.  Also, if youre pinching anywhere other than the center of the screen, it would be hard to move it right back to that exact spot repeatedly during the zoom.p  pHeres what Ive got nowp  precodevoiddidReceivePinchGestureUIPinchGestureRecognizergesture      double newCellSize  [IMMapViewLayout mainCollectionView.collectionViewLayout cellSize]  gesture.scale     newCellSize  MINnewCellSize, 100     newCellSize  MAXnewCellSize, 15      [IMMapViewLayout mainCollectionView.collectionViewLayout setCellSizenewCellSize]     [mainCollectionView.collectionViewLayout invalidateLayout]      if[gesture numberOfTouches] gt 2          CGPoint touch1  [gesture locationOfTouch0 inViewmainCollectionView]         CGPoint touch2  [gesture locationOfTouch1 inViewmainCollectionView]         CGPoint mid         mid.x  touch2.x  touch1.x  2  touch1.x         mid.y  touch2.y  touch1.y  2  touch1.y          NSIndexPath currentIndexPath  [mainCollectionView indexPathForItemAtPointmid]         [mainCollectionView scrollToItemAtIndexPathcurrentIndexPath atScrollPositionUICollectionViewScrollPositionCenteredVertically animatedNO]       codepre  pCan anyone help me make this codeUICollectionViewcode zoom, in its entirety, but centered on the position of the pinchp

Then naively one might propose such code by simply embedded this parallel within a do loopp  precodedo t1tmax    lt Fortran serial code block Cgt    OMP PARALLEL SECTIONS    OMP SECTION    lt Fortran code block Agt    OMP SECTION    lt Fortran code block Bgt    OMP END SECTIONS  end do codepre  pHowever, it is obvious that the creation of the thread overheads will largely decelerate this speed, which even possibly make it slower than a standard serial code. Therefore, one might come up with smarter idea to solve this. p  pI was wondering whether you can help me on giving some hints on how to do this. Whats the best approach fastest computation on this p
Negative 833 pHow does the GCM or cloud server know if its the same tablet thats trying to register again i mean, you only send the sender id, the same sender id for the same app right so how does the server know if its a different device, does the GCMRegistrar also implicitly send a certain device ID together with the sender ID and the package namep  pIm puzzled how it saves the registration. What if I uninstall the app on my tablet, will it also remove the registration ID in the gcm server What if I reinstall the app after uninstalling, will it provide the same registration ID or create a new one how will it know that its the same devicep  pAlso I dont know thats the use of unregistering from GCM. why would I do that unless my app is being uninstalledp  pThank you very much p

Negative 833 pIm using ZfcUser with htuserregistration and scnsocialauth and there are 2 fairly minor enhancements I want to achieve to extend my implementation, but Im not having much success so farp  ol liphtuserregistration sends new users an email after registering and denies them access until theyve activated their account, this is working fine. What Id like to do to extend this is redirect the user after registration so that they are sent to a page telling them to check their email rather than to the login page, which is the default behaviour of ZfcUser. I have tried adding an event listener to the module bootstrap that looks like thisp  precoderesponse  egtgetResponse  indicate that we intend to redirect after register action  set the redirection location to the home page responsegtgetHeadersgtaddHeaderLineLocation, home responsegtsetStatusCode302 responsegtsendHeaders  em  ZendEventManagerStaticEventManagergetInstance emgtattachZfcUserServiceUser, register, functionevent use response       dont allow anything else to process this event     eventgtstopPropagation      return the redirect response     return response  codepre  pThis is called correctly but the redirect never happens and the user still ends up at the login page. Is there something else I need to do to execute the redirect Or maybe theres a better way entirely to achieve thispli lipId like to add layout variables so that I can modify page titles and navigation in my layout template for the ZfcUser pages. In order to do this I made an override of the UserController from ZfcUser like this p  precodeclass UserController extends ZfcUserControllerUserController      public function loginAction              thisgtlayoutgtsetVariablesarray             viewtitle         gt Reports Login,                  return parentloginAction       codepre  pAnd then overrode the invokable for zfcuser in the config like thisp  precodecontrollers gt array invokables gt array     ApplicationControllerIndex  gt ApplicationControllerIndexController,     zfcuser                       gt ApplicationControllerUserController, , codepre  p,p  pThe framework tries to instantiate my UserController at the right point but fails with an InvalidArgumentException You must supply a callable redirectCallback which I can see is required to construct the base controller but doesnt get passed to my overridden version  any clues why not I cant find a working example of this to help.p  pMaybe theres a much easier way to inject layout variables into another modules controller actionsp  p[strongEDIT] I have found a simple but not very elegant way of doing this. Since my module overrides the views for both login and registration then its possible to set layout variables within the view, thus I was able to add a one liner to the top of each view to set the layout variable, e.g.strongp  precodeltphp thisgtlayoutgtsetVariableviewtitle, Register for an account gt codepre  pstrongThis doesnt feel correct, but works.

Negative 833 pI have a big code base in TFS which has multiple .sln files, each with many projects and at least one unit test project.  Most of the unit tests rely on common XML and XSD files, and there are several other types of files .config, .xaml, etc that are needed by the code when unit testing.p  pBecause of the way that TFS builds and gathers the files for unit testing, most of those files are missing from the TestResults folder, so the tests are failing during our CI builds [this has been happening for a while, but Im new to the project, and am trying to fix the errors].  What TFS appears to do is this  First, it checks out all the code to a src folder with Solution1, Solution2, etc and builds it, just like the developers do locally.  Second, it copies the build outputs to a binBinaries folder.  Third, it looks for all the emtestem.dll files, copies them and their dependencies but only the dependencies, plus the App.config file to TestResultsDeploy[datetime]Out folder, and runs the unit tests there.p  pI am encountering two problems with this.  Because the second step is combining all the build outputs into one folder, all the files with duplicate names are overwriting each other.  So, there is only one App.config file, even though each solution has its own.  This is happening with other configxml files too, and with two poorly named unit test .dlls.  I can live with this if I have to because most of those config files are duplicates, and other files can be renamed.p  pThe second problem is that most of those extra files dont make it into the TestResults folder, and when they arent there the unit tests will fail.  I know about using the [DeploymentItem] attribute if that is the only solution, I will go that route, but there are so many extra files that I am looking for a different approach.p  pSo my question is, how can I configure my tfsrun builds amp unit tests to include all of the files that they need, without all the work amp maintenance problems of adding a lot of [DeploymentItem] attributes, and also without affecting the local builds amp unit tests for the developersp  h1Updateh1  pOne thing Ive found is that adding a [DeploymentItem] attribute to a unit test actually causes the deployment folder to be used.  Without that, it runs the unit tests in the binaries folder.  See a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms182475.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms182475.aspxa, under When is a separate deployment folder usedp  pAlso on that page, it says you can specify files to deploy in a .testsettings file, but then says you should avoid using it because your tests will run slower.  The newer alternative, a .runsettings file, does not let you list what files to deploy.p  pIt also appears that deployment becomes enabled if code coverage is enabled, which we dont currently do, but plan to once the tests are passing.p

The query does work in its current form so whether I drop it or not, Id like to know why Im doing so.p  pI tried searching to see if this has something to do with the scope of the query but it doesnt include the SCOPE keyword and have not found any search results on the third parameter etc. To my knowledge, this isnt related to subcubes etc, but Im happy to be corrected.p  pAny inputs or pointers into what I should be looking for would be much appreciated.p  papologies if Ive missed some other search criteriap  pThanks, Sp  pstrongemEdit added to add example while testing FrankPIs answeremstrongp  pThanks FrankPI.

Negative 833 pIm trying to rotate a bitmap around its center.

It rotates de bitmap but not from its center. Then I thought maybe the matrix multiplications were not saved. So I tried thisp  precode public void rotateDrawPixmapPixmap pixmap,int grados, int x, int y      Matrix mtx  new Matrix     int width  AndroidPixmappixmap.getWidth     int height  AndroidPixmappixmap.getHeight     int pivotX  width  2     int pivotY  height  2      mtx.postTranslatefloatpivotX,floatpivotY     mtx.postConcatmtx     mtx.postRotatefloatgrados     mtx.postConcatmtx     mtx.postTranslatefloatpivotX,floatpivotY     mtx.postConcatmtx      Bitmap bmpRotate  Bitmap.createBitmapAndroidPixmappixmap.bitmap,0,0, width1, height1,mtx,true     canvas.drawBitmapbmpRotate,x,y,null  codepre  pAnd the effect was the same. Still the rotation is shifted from its center. But the rotation is faster and I dont know why. So what can I do to rotate from its center a bitmap and why is more faster the second snippet of code than the firstp

Negative 833 pIn my architecture, I am using spring as both a web server, serving static html and javascript pages, and as a rest api. Currently, my spring app listens on port 8080. Even though I can easily change it to port 80, I think the api and the web server should be on different ports, and see no reason to create a separate app just to serve static content, which spring can easily do.p  pI did look online and at some other questions, and found spring emcanem listen on two different ports, using multiple servlet containers. Some question even said all one has to do is create multiple application context.p  pHowever, there was no mention on how to do so, which, at least for me, is not trivial, especially when using Spring Boot.p  ol liHow can I create multiple servlet containers or multiple application context, in order to listen on multiple ports 80 and 8080 li liAfter setting those up, how do I control which servlet does what that is, which one serves the static pages, and which one serves the rest apili ol  pp  h1EDITh1  pThe following question seems to match my own, yet as previously mentioned, I do not know how to implement this, specially when using Spring BootAnnotations, and not xml configuration.p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions21630820configuremultipleservletcontainersservletswithspringbootConfigure multiple servletcontainersservlets with spring bootap  h1EDIT 2h1  pA good use case for such a thing would be making your site sslenabled, yet not required.

Note that unlike his method, I am using a servlet container customizer to change the port, but still im using a second thread and creating second spring application.p  h1EDIT Answerh1  pThe original answer of Dave Syer is working, but it was not what I was looking for.

Negative 833 pFor a school project i have made a program that can solve a rubiks cube you know, that cube with all the colors. But now my teachers asked if i could do some research and try out 3d animation for one of the sides. But they want to see the mathematical way to do it. I have found a way to move the corners with the use of polar coordinates. But i do not know how i could render a cube in 3d and be able to animate it. p  pSo my question is how can i render things like a cube in 3d or are there any good libraries for it and how could i use these polar coordinates to animate it And is there a good tutorial out there for java 3d renderingp  pi must say that i have absolutely no experience with 3d rendering, so it might be a bit difficult.

Negative 833 pI have a service implemented in Java which depends on 3 property files. I have defined define for each of the property file in a common properties module and consuming them from service specific module. The define for one of the property file is shown belowp  precodedefine propertiesrabbitmq    propertyfile,   servicename,   rabbitmqhost,   rabbitmqusername,   rabbitmqpassword,   rabbitmqport,   rabbitmqvhost    file  propertyfile     ensure  gt file,     content gt templateconfigrabbitmq.properties.erb,     mode    gt 0644,     notify  gt Service[servicename],     codepre  pI am following roles and profile pattern in my puppet code and doing all hiera lookups in service specific profile. Now because of this whenever there is a change in property files, I need to make cascading changes to all of my puppet modules that consumes that property file. The changes are needed in profile hiera lookup, module init.pp additionremoval of parametes from constructor and config.pp parameter adjustment when invoking define for a property file.p  pI feel that the above problem can be solved by incorporating hiera lookups in define for a property file, like thisp  precodedefine propertiesrabbitmq propertyfile, servicename,     rabbitmqhost  hierarabbitmqhost   rabbitmqusername  hierarabbitmqusername   rabbitmqpassword  hierarabbitmqpassword   rabbitmqport  hierarabbitmqport   rabbitmqvhost  hierarabbitmqvhost    file  propertyfile     ensure  gt file,     content gt templateconfigrabbitmq.properties.erb,     mode    gt 0644,     notify  gt Service[servicename],     codepre  pBut, above is a violation of roles and profile pattern. The above is doing hiera lookup in a module instead of doing it in profile. Now, the module has a tight dependency on hiera. It being an internal module not meant for puppet forge, I guess, it should be OK to violate the guideline in favor of code maintainability.p  pI seek opinion from others on above.p

Negative 833 pI dont know if this is possible but.

Or I could create multi users user11 amp user12 for example but thats not a good option to use.p

Negative 833 pWe are working on a video player plugin with FireBreath. It has a windowless mode, and in Chrome on Windows it produces a very strange effect. p  pWhenever we try to paint in the codehdccode the pixels appear either in the right colour or inverted, depending of the value of the most significant bit in any of the 3 channels. p  pThis means that in full colour depth on average half of the pixels appear inverted, while the other half is fine. It is the same both when displaying a video frame using codeStretchDIBitscode, and when just filling with solid colours with codeFillRectcode. The codeSetStretchBltModecode is set to codeCOLORONCOLORcode.p  pWe could not find a solution so far, our temporary hack is to convert the colours to half the depth and set all the most significant bits to 1, but its obviously a bad solution for the waste of CPU effort and losing half the colour depth.p

My save function works fine on the Angular side, but Im not sure what to do on the Web API amp Repository side. You will see that my code to get this working is very basic bare bones. I have all of the code pages from my project in a gist herep  pa hrefhttpsgist.github.comhttpJunkie6baced0c2fa2aabc9e7a relnofollowAll Files in Gistap  pJust in case you want to see the big picture, otherwise I will just put here the few pages where I am having trouble getting the EditUpdate methods to work in using codehttp.putcode with Angular Controller, Web API Controller amp Repository.p  pstrongWORKING Angular Edit Controllerstrong  p  precodefunction editFavoriteControllerhttp, window, routeParams      var vm  this      var url  apifavorites  routeParams.searchId     http.geturl         .successfunction result              vm.search  result[0]                  .errorfunction               alerterrorfailed                  .thenfunction               Nothing               vm.update  function id          var updateUrl  apifavorites  id         http.putupdateUrl, vm.editFavorite             .successfunction result                  var editFavorite  result.data                 TODO merge with existing favorites                 alertThanks for your post                          .errorfunction                   alertYour broken, go fix yourself                          .thenfunction                   window.location                      codepre  pstrongNOT WORKING Web API Controllerstrong  p  precodepublic HttpResponseMessage Putint id,[FromBody]Search editFavorite      if favRepo.EditFavoriteid, editFavorite ampamp favRepo.Save              return Request.CreateResponseHttpStatusCode.Created, editFavorite          return Request.CreateResponseHttpStatusCode.BadRequest  codepre  pstrongNOT WORKING Repositorystrong  p  precodepublic bool EditFavoriteint id, Search editFavorite          try              var search  ctx.Search.FirstOrDefaults gt s.SearchId  id          searcheditFavorite.State  EntityState.Modified         return true          catch              var item         codepre  pstrongWORKING Interfacestrong  p  precodebool EditFavoriteint id, Search newSearch codepre  pAgain, my only problems are figuring out what to do for the update in the WebAPI codeFavoritesControllercode and codeFavoritesRepositorycode.

Negative 833 pIm taking a class and one of the problems requires us to build a ruby script. In the script define a method call codeuniquecode, which will accept an argument of an array. Then have the method remove duplicate items from an array. Example codeunique[1,2,3,2,1,6,9]code would return code[1,2,3,6,9]code. We have to implement a version that uses the codearray.uniqcode method and implement one that doesnt this version will loop through the input array and build an output array by pushing items on it, depending on whether or not it is codeincludedcode in the array.p  pThis is what I have written so far.  There are 3 methods.  The first uses the codearray.uniqcode and functions as expected. The second is an attempt to use code.includecode, but it returns all of the numbers in the array, obviously. Not sure what I was doing there... The third was a shot in the dark at a way to see if the number is being duplicated and if it is, not add it to the codetestarraycode.p  pCan anyone help this new guy figure out what Im doing wrong and what I should be doing Thank you all in advancep  precodenumbers  [1,2,3,2,1,6,9]  def uniquearray   unum  array.uniq   puts These are the numbers in the array array without duplicates unum end  puts uniquenumbers    newarray  []  numbers.each do number   if numbers.includenumber     newarray ltlt number   end end  puts newarray      testarray  []  numbers.each do number   if number.detect  i numbers      testarray ltlt i   end end  puts testarray codepre

Negative 833 pI have a program to perform a bunch of tests on a device, which Ive been running for a number of days now. The test results are normally stored in a CCLI String object and outputted to a RTF display in the program every couple seconds. Due to the program crashing with extremely long outputs, I added an option to disable the display. So, the RTF data is just kept inside the CCLI String object.p  pWhen I came back to check the test results, and tried to turn on the display, the program of course became nonresponsive. After waiting a long time for it to respond, I decided to use HxD a memory tool to look at the RAM used by the application. The RTF data is indeed there, in many large chunks. I endeavored to save the chunks as best I could, until I realized that they were changing as I was doing it, and also that there were so many that this would take many many hours.p  pRather than continue, I decided the best option may be to save that RAM data as a whole, and parse it later. The total file is 4 gigabytes. I would like to find a way to pull out the RTF data only and piece it together into a readable log file. Does anyone know the best way to go about doing something like thisp

Negative 833 pChecked for an hour, cannot find the answer to my question...p  pIm creating a chat room app that displays codeMessagescode based on codeTimeStampcode and codeRoomIDcode. Im currently using a codeListViewcode and calling codeDataBindcode every time new messages are found. Im using variable codeListltMessagegt DisplayedMessagescode as a data store and using codeMessageList.DataSource  DisplayedMessages MessageList.DataBindcode every time I want to display the most current messages to the user. These messages also have a codenullablecode column called codeImageIDcode that holds a URL to a thumbnail image that is displayed directly in the codeListViewcode. The thing is, Im concerned about performance issues if the users codeDisplayedMessagescode were to get to a count of 5000 codeMessagescode with thumbnail images. That would mean that each time a new message is posted, the system would have to retrieve at least 5000 thumbnails.p  pId like to know if there is a way to simply emappendem items to a codeListViewcode without disrupting previously added items. If that were the case, I could just add any newly found codeMessagescode to the users codeListViewcode while leaving any alreadyposted codeMessagescode in place. I have an codeUpdatePanelcode in place and Im hoping theres a way I can slap on a couple messages without having to fetch the whole data source every couple of seconds.p  pI like the behavior of the codeListBoxcode control, and was using it successfully up until the point of inserting images, having multiline messages, and a few other problems. I find the codeListViewcode more flexible, but Im willing to change controls completely if necessary. Any help is appreciated, thanks for reading.p

My chain of thought was this the Arduino is quite weak and codeactionscode is going to be accessed a lot. So I thought its a bit more work to implement it initially but it will make sure the timer doesnt use too much of the Arduinos resources.p  pIve tried a lot of things but I dont really understand where the problem lies. So thats why Im asking an expert to look at my code and maybe put me on the right track.p

Negative 833 pI have an mesos cluster environment where I have connected two mesos masters. Both the mesos masters are mentioned in the zookeeper.

I dont know if this is normal. p  pI am using linux Mint, and downloaded mesos from mesosphere library. p

Negative 833 pIm writing a small AIR application that loads a presentation from a server and transitions through the slides using TweenMax. Each codeSlidecode object within the loaded presentation contains basic information about the slide, telling the codeRenderercode class how to draw it things like where a TextField should be, what its text should be, any filters that should be applied to the TextField, etc.p  pThe codeRenderercode then creates a Bitmap using the provided specifications, and that Bitmap is then given an alpha of 0 and tweened in using codeTweenMax.tocode.p  pI have a relatively powerful machine, one that should be able to handle such a task no problem. However, when I tween the Bitmap in, the framerate drops from a capped 60fps to around em11fpsem. The output resolution the size of the generated codeBitmapcode is only 1436x1076.p  pMy question is strongemis there anything else I can do to improve the performance of my applicationemstrongp  pAll tips are appreciated.

Negative 833 pSo, heres the thing. I really like the idea of microservices and want to set it up and test it before deciding if I want to use it in production. And then if I do want to use it I want to slowly chip away pieces of my old rails app and move logic to microservices. This I think I can do using HAProxy and set up different routing based on URLs. So this should be covered.p  pThen my next biggest concern is that I dont want too much overhead to ensure everything is running smoothly on the infrastructure side. I want preferrably low configuration and the ease of development, testing and deployment.p  pNow, I want to know what are the benefits and downsides of each styles. Akka cluster vs something like Kubernetes maybe even fabric8 on top of it.p  pWhat I also worry about is fault tolerance. I dont know how do you do that with Kubernetes. Do you then have to include some message queue to ensure your messages dont get lost And then also have multiple queue if one of the queues goes down Or just retry until queue comes up again Akka actors already have that right Retrying and mail boxes What are the strategies for fault tolerance for microservices Do they differ for each approachp  pSomeone please enlighten me p

Negative 833 pIm developing Android application that uses fragment. The menu list will be appear when you click the top left menu icon. After clicking a menu item, it creates a new Intent and start a new Activity that also uses fragment with the same menu order.

I dont want to change the order for each activity but I want the app only switch to other activity when user click on a menu item.

Negative 833 pI am a C beginner. I am implementing some code in C which will call an interface function with parameters codeuint8t valuecode strongpass as bufferstrong and codeint32t lengthcode strongpass as length of bufferstrong.  p  precodeinterface function declaration in header file   this interface implementation is not under my   control. I just call the following function.   The return value is 0successful or 1fail   int getparameteruint8t value, uint32t length  My .c File  can it be passed as buffer because the function will  assign some memory located value to this parameter.  uint8t cant have value greater than 255 but in my  case the memory located value can be larger than 255   uint8t value   Is it correct    This should be the length of the buffer declared above uint32t length  sizeofvalue   interface function call in my code  int result  getparameterampvalue, amplength  ifresult  0     char data    int32t myValue want to assign what value parameter pointing to    memcpydata  sizeofint32t, ampvalue, length perhaps something like this    codepre  pValue and length are inout parameters. This interface function will assign value, can be strongltstrong or strongstrong 255, to value parameter and assign the length of that value strongin bytesstrong to length parameter.p  pMy question is that, how to call interface function codeint getparameteruint8t value, uint32t lengthcode so that it may assign some value to value parameter regardless of size.

Hazelcast uses blockingasync Map as a storage, but it blocks by key but not entier map object. But actor makes itputs sequential, so there is no way to put sevarlal codeputkey,valuecode one should wait for the next one in the actors queue. With no actor this two puts could happans in parrallel.p  pCorrect me if Im wrong.p  pWe may think about putget as of beeing blockinglong operations since hazelcast works in clusters, so it is not as fast as just plain memory map. But if having more than one actors to makes it faster then we should think about locking if two actors tryng to add same codekey,valuecode pair as we would not having actors. Having empool of actorsem.. leads to idea not using actors at all in this scenario. p  pWe indeed may have many reader actors, but even without codeactorcodeinvolvment we could read from hazelcast map from all N threads simulanuisly again assuming that codegetcode may take some time due to blockinglongliving nature of it in hazelcast.p  pTo make a quesion of it strongQstrong Does it make sense to use Actors wrappaing codehazelcastcode in itp
