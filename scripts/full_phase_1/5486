Positive 5486 pIm trying to write a simple C program that creates a linked list. I would like to make this list be able to store any type of data in its container. However, I realised that my main problem is being able to accept any type of input and storing it. For example, if the variable codestdcincode stores to is of type string, only strings will be accepted, and this variable must be defined before program compilation.p  pMy question is is there any way to accept any type of input with a codestdcincode or any other input method and then call certain functions depending on the inputs typep  pSomething along the logic of...p  precodecin gtgt data  if data.type  string      cout ltlt datas type string   if data.type  int      cout ltlt datas type int  codepre  pThank youp

Positive 5486 pHavent got a whole lot of experience in making android apps. Is it possible to addremove user input widgets and actions to an android in the field without having to recompile and reinstallp  pI am thinking the user should be able to use a service that constructs a simple interface inside the app they have installed beforehand.p  pSo like creating a building a htmlform from a json object. A series of widgets and validation rules, which is known individually beforehand, but strung together in a dynamically defined series.p  pDoes that make sense I am sorry, its a little hard to explain and I am not a native english speaker.p  pI could of course a webview or just make it a webapp and use the browser or maybe phonegap or something like it will have the tools for doing this, but I just really wanted to use a native app for it, if possible.p  pI have tried googling, but with no luck.p  pIs this possible to do If so howp

Positive 5486 pFor this program, I have a user input elements into a 5 space array using the codeprivate static void addcode method. After adding these elements, the user is then able to use the codeprivate static void deletecode method which allows them to input a number present in the array that they wish to remove. When entering numbers to remove, the program works perfectly fine unless I try to remove the last number for the codecurrentSizecode of the array. For example, if I have an array with the following indexes and valuesp  precode0.  1 1.  2 2.  3 3.  4 4.  ltemptygt codepre  pThe codecurrentSizecode of the array is currently 4. If I try to remove value 4 in index 3, the program will not remove value 4. If I attempt to remove values 3, 2, or 1 after trying to remove value 4, these values will not remove either. On the other hand if I want to remove any of the values below value 4 first, i.e values 1, 2, and 3, the program works correctly until I try to remove value 4 in index 0. If I attempt to remove value 4 at this point, nothing is removed. If I try to add a value, say 1, after attempting to remove value 4, value 4 is replaced with value 1. If I attempt to remove value 4 twice at index 0 and then attempt to add a new value, I get an codeIndexOutOfBoundsException 1code . I believe that this has something to do with codecurrentSizecode decrementing when it is not suppose to in the remove element algorithm present in the codeprivate static void deletecode method. If anyone has a solution for this it would be greatly appreciated, thank you. The program is posted below.

Positive 5486 pI am to make a mobile painting game in Unity and Ive encountered a serious problem the Input class in Unity is framedependent. Thus I cant get the position of touch frequent enough to make my application draw smoothly as a result I get something like just points on the background, not connected between each other.p  pI tried to just connect the points that are detected in Unity, and than my result was just the same points connected with lines, of course. I was trying this in Unity Editor with about 180200 fps, and on mobile phone with 3050 fps it looks even worse. I expect that I have to get the touch positions somehow in android studio or Xcode, and only then use them in my C code in Unity editor.p  pAm I thinking right to use extern from Unity tools, or there is another easier way to do it directly in Unity If there is none and I am right, can somebody give me some links to guidestutorials how to do it and integrate it with Unity I have never worked outside of Unity and have no experience in integration some external tools with it.p  pNote Ive tried FixedUpdate without any luck  it doesnt matter how often I try to get the position variables, it is about how often they are updated I also tried Event.current.mousePositionin unity editor in OnGUI method, but it also gave me no difference.p  pUpd As I have already said, I need to get positions more frequently than the Input class gives me.

Positive 5486 pI have been trying to get this program to work which is supposed to continue to take input from a user until 1 is entered and compute the sum.

Notice that 1 is not part of the output.  Make sure the program  validates each entered number before proc essing it as the user may enter negative  numbers other than the sentential value 1 .br Design your program such that it  allows the user to rerun the  program with a different set of inputs in the same run as shown above.

Negative 5486 pWe are an all Unix shop Solaris, Linux. This last product cycle I returned to a project lead capacity, and needed to produce a schedule. I asked what tools my managers would accept, and was surprised to hear text files. My teammate and I gamely tried this, and probably worse, HTML tables, to track the tasks we wanted to size. It was pretty painful.p  pWe then tried a few tools. MrProject is buggy, limited and crashes too frequently. My manager swears that Microsoft Project is inflexible. Whenever they needed to change a task, reassign a resource or rebalance, it generally hosed their plan. So I started looking around on the Internet for a Linuxcapable project planning tool. One that sounded interesting is a hrefhttpwww.taskjuggler.orgTaskJugglera. Its neat in that the inputs are declarative files. I feel like Im building a makefile for a project.p  pHowever. I have a limited amount of time to devote to evaluating this tool and it seems pretty complex. Before diving into the next product cycle, Id like to know if TaskJuggler is robust enough, flexible and capable of handling multimonth, multiple resource projects with frequent changes. So Im calling on all engineers who have had experience with this tool to share their insights. Thanksp
Negative 5486 pI am having a problem getting a list of fields from a query defined at run time by the users of my program.  I let my users enter a SQL query into a memo control and then I want to let them go through the fields that will return and do such things as format the output, sum column values and so forth.  So, I have to get the column names so they have a place to enter the additional information.p  pI would do fine if there were no parameters, but I also have to let them define filter parameters for the query.  So, if I want to set the parameters to null, I have to know what the parameters datatype is.p  pI am using Delphi 2006. I connect to a Firebird 2.1 database using the DBExpress component TSQLConnection and TSQLQuery. Previously, I was successful usingp  pfor i  0 to Qry.Params.Count  1 do Qry.Params[i].value  varNullp  pI discovered I had a problem when I tried to use a date parameter. It was just a coincidence that all my parameters up until then had been integers record IDs.  It turns out that varNull is just an enumerated constant with a value of 1 so I was getting acceptable results no records was working okay.p  pI only need a list of the fields.  Maybe I should just parse the SELECT clause of the SQL statement.  I thought setting Qry.Prepared to True would get me a list of the fields but no such luck.  It wants values for the parameters.  p  pIf you have an idea, I would sure like to hear it.  Thanks for any help.p
Negative 5486 pIve heard it said that the Entity Framework is overkill or that its difficult to learn compared to LinqToSql.p  pI am wondering in what way  I used LinqToSql and like it.  So, I am trying the EF and for the things Im doing they seem almost exactly the same.  Namespaces and method names are different but so far I dont see anything that makes the EF harder than LinqToSql.p  pIm sure if I start doing more comples things it gets more complex.  But then again I probably cant do the same thing with LinqToSql at all so I see that as a plus for the EF just in case I do want to do something more complex.p  pDoes the EF use more resources than LinqToSql so much so that I should not use it if all I need is LinqToSqllike functionalityp  pUpdate I did some tests and my tests seems to point to Linq to Entities performing better than Linq to SQL.p  pI first delete 1000 records from a single table, add 1000 records, edit 1000 records and then databind them to a DataView. LinqToSQL 5 seconds LinqToEntities 2 secondsp  pI performed the same test using two joined tables and the results were similar.p  pMy tests seem to support another post a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions257016linqtosqlvsentityframeworkperformancehttpstackoverflow.comquestions257016linqtosqlvsentityframeworkperformanceap  pUpdate 2p  pThanks for the replies.  It appears to me that Linq to Entities isnt really overkill versus Linq to SQL.  After researching more I think going with Linq to Entities is the way to go.  It appears to have better performance.  p  pI believe the overkill statements that Ive heard are made because Linq to Entities can do much more than Linq To SQL and it does require more configuration about 1 more line in the web.config.  Also there are small things that Linq to Entities does differently from Linq to SQL that might make someone feel as though Linq to Entities is more complicated.  But once you learn how to do things it seems Linq to Entities is no more complicated than Linq to SQL.p
Negative 5486 pDoes anyone have any good references for equations which can be implemented relatively easily for how to compute the transfer of angular momentum between two rigid bodiesp  pIve been searching for this sort of thing for a while, and I havent found any particularly comprehensible explanations of the problem.p  pTo be precise, the question comes about as this two rigid bodies are moving on a frictionless well, nearly surface think of it as air hockey.  The two rigid bodies come into contact, and then move away.  Now, without considering angular momentum, the equations are relatively simple the problem becomes, what happens with the transfer of angular momentum between the bodiesp  pAs an example, assume the two bodies have no angular momentum whatsoever theyre not rotating.  When they interact at an oblique angle vector of travel does not align with the line of their centers of mass, obviously a certain amount of their momentum gets transferred into angular momentum i.e. they each get a certain amount of spin, but how much and what are the equations for suchp  pThis can probably be solved by using a manybody rigid system to calculate, but I want to get a much more optimized calculation going, so I can calculate this stuff in realtime.  Does anyone have any ideas on the equations, or pointers to opensource implementations of these calculations for inclusion in a project  To be precise, I need this to be a rather welloptimized calculation, because of the number of interactions that need to be simulated within a single tick of the simulation.p  pEdit Okay, it looks like theres not a lot of precise information about this topic out there.  And I find the Physics for Programmers type of books to be a bit too... dumbed down to really get I dont want code implementation of an algorithm I want to figure out or at least have sketched out for me the algorithm.

After reading carefully them and the code I realized that what I was trying to do was really a wrong approach. The idea was to combine SFINAE behavior with an adaptation to the template mustbepod which I found in the book emImperfect Cem, but it can be found in another places, too. Actually, this would require a quite particular set of rules for SFINAE, which are not what the standard defines, obviously. This is not really a bug in VS, after all.p

Negative 5486 pI need to implement login velocity checking for a web service.  The service is in ruby and the database is MySql.p  pI can imagine bad ways to do this.  For example, have a table that stores every login attempts time and whether or not it was successful, and every time the user tries to log in, query that table for the last emnem login attempts and run some simple algorithm against it.  That seems pretty clearly grossly inefficient, though.  Every login attempt does a select and an insert on a pretty large table which will slow down the system as a whole.p  pA better way might be to say that the value of emnem is hardcoded to be three or something, and in the user table wherever password verifiers are stored add emnem columns which hold the most recent emnem login attempts.  This removes the extra select statement, and the user table is presumably much shorter than the login attempts table would be.  However, it looses a lot of data that could be interesting if the algorithm were to change.p  pAt this point Im leaning towards a variation on that structure which puts a single text field in the table with the password verifiers, and that text field holds a serialized object which is an array of login attempt records.  On a login attempt that field would be parsed and rewritten.  This solves the fixed emnem problem while preventing having to query a very large table.  However, reading text fields out of the database of course has poor disk access characteristics which may end up making it a poor solution as well.p  pFinally, another possibility is to use MySqls logfilebacked database whos name I dont know, but I know almost nothing about it, except that it is supposed to be efficient at querying log files.p  pMy question for Stack Overflow is How are login velocity checks normally implemented in industryp  pbUpdate 1bp  pI should have defined velocity check.  A velocity check for login attempts keeps track both of the number of consecutive failures and the time frame in which consecutive failures occurred.  The first reply does point towards a solution with those properties.  I wonder, though, if it retains enough information to allow for flexibility in the velocity checking.  Having never built such a system, my concern is that I am overlooking important aspects of velocity checking that I will wish to have considered when I started building it...p

Negative 5486 pIm writing a simple CMS based on Django. Most content management systems rely on having a fixed page, on a fixed URL, using a template that has one or many editable regions. To have an editable region, you require a Page. For the system to work out which page, you require the URL.p  pThe problem comes when youre no longer dealing with pages be those FlatPages pages, or something else, but rather instances from another Model. For example if I have a Model of products, I may wish to create a detail page that has multiple editable regions within.p  pI emcouldem build those regions into the Model but in my case, there are several Models and is a lot of variance in how much data I want to show.p  pTherefore, I want to build the CMS at template level and specify what a block an editable region is based on the instance of page or the model it uses.p  pIve had the idea that perhaps I could dump custom template tags on the page like thisp  precode block uniqueobject unique placeholder name  codepre  pAnd that would find a block based on the two arguments passed in. An examplep  precodelth1gt productinstance.name lth1gt  block productinstance detail product short description   block productinstance detail product video   block productinstance detail product long description  codepre  pSounds spiffy, right Well the problem Im running into is how do I create a key for a zone so I can pull the correct block out Ill be dealing with a completely unknown object it could be a page object, a URL, a model instance, anything  it could even be a boatcodeltfggtcode.p  pOther Django microapplications must do this. You can tag anything with djangotagging, right Ive tried to understand how that works but Im drawing blanks.p  pSo, firstly, am I mad And assuming I not, and this looks like a relatively sane idea to persue, how should I go about linking an objectstring to a blockeditableregionp  pNote Editing will be done emonthepageem so theres no real issue in letting the users edit the zones.

Negative 5486 pIm interested in sending all Rails application logging to a database MySQL or MongoDB either in addition to or instead of to a log file. There are a few reasons, most of which are concerned about log file analysis. We already use Google Analytics, but there are a variety of things we want to do that arent as workable in Analytics.  p  pFurthermore, Id like to do real time investigation of issues by looking at logs. Sifting through a log file is a tedious way to do that, and Id like to do better searching and filtering than a log file easily allows for. p  pFinally, I often want to examine something closer to site visitor behavior tracing the path through the site for example, so that I can see what the last page was that a user was looking at before an error occurred.  Given we have multiple app servers, the separate log files make this a real pain. If all the data were in a database, I could then easily see the proper sequence of pages for a given visitor. I know that Syslog would be one way to solve this particular thing single log filerepository, but I want to combine that with better searching abilities that I associate with database searches.p  pIm wondering what folks recommend to solve this. Do you directly log to a database, or do you dump log files into a DB but whats your approach for that so that its essentially realtimeas up to date as the logfile itself  p  pI am currently determining at what level Id like this logging, because another thing I looked at is writing a small Rack filter that would log all requests. This would miss all the extra output that the normal Rails logging dumps out all the SQL and output on cache hits and misses, etc., but it would achieve a big part of my goal, and seems to have the advantage of not disturbing anything else in the system.p  pAnyway, I am not looking for one right answer, more of a discussion and information on what anyone else might be doing in this same light.p

The architecture is designed so that some controls rely on a certain unique id assigned to each request. p  pTo create such UID we use a DB2 Sequence.

Negative 5486 pI have been doing TDD for the past 3 years. We were a small company, and we had very solid support for most aspects of the agile process from management. Everyone on the development team was sold on the process. And thus, the upfront investment it usually takes to build fixtures was accepted knowing it would pay off along the way. Code that starts an http server, code that populates sql databases before tests, etc. Documentation mostly happened in the tests and help requests were usually presented in the form a failing test.p  pNow I moved to a bigger company, and while management is supportive of the Agile process, teammates are a mixed bag, some of them see it useful, some of them do it because of management and some dont see the value. Its been a challenge to convince people to spend some time building fixtures or to convince a team member the best way for me to help him if he took the time to write a failing test.p  pSo what do you think is the best way to sell TDD to a hesitant teammate The objections are usually  Its an unneeded cost,  we can always write tests after the fact for parts that are important, its a buzz word, teams pick it up and then it falls to the side as the heavy grind begins etc.p

Negative 5486 blockquote   pstrongPossible Duplicatestrongbr   a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1793800caniredefineacmacrothendefineitbackCan I redefine a C macro then define it backa  p blockquote    pSay I have some code that uses the name codeBLAHcode for a variable. Suppose codeBLAHcode is a common preprocessor definition in many standard header files defined as 10, so if my file is included after any of them, the code breaks because codeBLAHcode is transformed into 10 therefore, I must codeundef BLAHcode. But also other headers may depend on codeBLAHcode, so I must restore codeBLAHcode to its original value after my header is done. Is it possible to do something like thisp  precodeifdef BLAH define BLAHOLD BLAH undef BLAH endif  ... code ...   restore BLAH to 10 ifdef BLAHOLD define BLAH BLAHOLD end codepre  p This doesnt work of course, because BLAH is not expanded to 10. I have tried doing something likep  precodedefine EXPANDAGAINx x define EXPANDx EXPANDAGAINx define BLAHOLD EXPANDBLAH codepre  pbut that doesnt work either, since EXPAND is taken literally and not expanded.

Negative 5486 pim developing a multiplatform C fuzzing application. The app spawns a child process and checks whether it stopped unexpectedly. Ive already managed to do this on linux, however, windows exception handling mechanism is making things hard for me. p  pMy code right now does the following  Call CreateProcess to spawn the process.  WaitForSingleObject to wait for it to terminate.  Then call GetExitCodeProcess and check if the exit code corresponds to an exception.p  pEverything works as it should, ive tested it with a null dereferencing test application, and i can catch the exception gracefully. However, each time i test this, a Windows error message box spawns telling me to Send or Not Send the error report. Since the fuzzer is supposed to be an automatic testing application, id need to somehow disable this notification, so that even if an exception is caught, the fuzzer can continue testing.p  pIve already tried installing a SEH handler, but had no luckapparently these handlers arent inherited by child processes. Ive read something about using vectored exception handling, but suppose it would be the same, i believe vector handlers arent inherited. p  pCould anybody help me with this problem I dont know what to search for, ive already googled a lot and havent found anyhing. p  pThanksp

Negative 5486 pIm working on a research problem out of curiosity, and I dont know how to program the logic that Ive in mind.

That is,p  precodev12  v1v2 v13  v1v3 v14  v1v4 v23  v2v3 v24  v2v4 v34  v3v4 codepre  pTill this step it is just fine. The problemtrick is now, at the end of each iteration I give the obtained vectors into a black box function, and it returns only a few of the vectors, say v12, v13 and v34. Now, I want to add each of these vectors one vector from v1, v2, v3, v4 which it hasnt added before. For example, v3 and v4 hasnt been added to v12, so I want to create v123 and v124. Similarly for all the vectors like,p  precodev12 should become v123  v12v3 v124  v12v4  v13 should become v132  This should not occur because I already have v123 v134  v13v4 codepre  blockquote   pv14,v23 and v24 cannot be considered   because it was deleted in the black   box function so all we have in our   hands to work with is v12,v13 and v34.p blockquote  precodev34 should become v341  Cannot occur because we have 134 v342  v34v2 codepre  pIt is important that I do not do it all in one step at the start.

Negative 5486 pnewbie to Entity Framework here.  Using VS 2010 and SQL Server 2008 express DB.p  pI was having trouble refreshing an Entity Data Model after adding new tables.  So, I followed a suggestion I found here to just delete and regenerate the model.p  pI get to the Choose Your Data Connection section of the Entity Data Model Wizard and Save entity connection settings in Web.config as is checked.  However, my existing name has a 1 appended to it.  For example MyDatabaseEntities is now MyDatabaseEntities1.  Of course, I dont want the 1 appended.  I killed the existing connection string in Web.config and removed all references to that name in my solution.  Yet when I try to continue Im presented with the following error  p  pMyDatabaseEntites conflicts with an existing property name in the Application Settings.  Please choose a different name     p  pI cant find a reference to that name anywhere in the solution.

Negative 5486 pIve got a class that is a descendant of SQLAlchemys declarative base. I need to write a bridge object that will translate between the declarative base and another system I am running, but I want the bridge object to not have to know exactly what columns are in my record. That being the case, I want a way to list all of the columns in the record, to keep from having to maintain a list of attributes in two only vaguely related places, and to minimize replication in the meantime. This means I could create the column attributes, then maintain a separate list of column names, but again, replication is a factorif I wanted to change the structure of this thing later, Id have to change it in both places.p  pThat being the case, I thought about sticking the column definitions in a dict, and then iterating over the dict to create each column definitions with setattr, like sop  precode    for k,v in self.columndict.items         setattrself,k,                 sqlalchemy.Columnv[columntype],v.getopts,,                  codepre  pNow, heres the rub If I stick this bit of code on the class level, self is not yet defined, and I get an error which makes sense. If I stick this in codeinitcode, self is defined, but SQLAlchemys declarative base gives an error because there is no primary key on the table by the time the class has finished being defined which makes sense, since those attributes wont be set until runtime.p  pSo, that all being said, how do I get what I want without using eval, or is using eval my only option, herep  hr  pEDIT I accepted a solution below, but didnt use it 100 although it was absolutely instrumental in getting me the answer.

Negative 5486 precode Failed system call was shmgetkey5432001, size16498688, 03600. HINT  This error usually means that PostgreSQLs request for a shared memory segment exceeded your kernels SHMMAX parameter.  You can either reduce the request size or reconfigure the kernel with larger SHMMAX.  To reduce the request size currently 16498688 bytes, reduce PostgreSQLs sharedbuffers parameter currently 1536 andor its maxconnections parameter currently 104.     If the request size is already small, its possible that it is less than your kernels SHMMIN parameter, in which case raising the request size or reconfiguring SHMMIN is called for.

Negative 5486 pI am writing a solution for a user that matches a list of phone numbers they enter against a customer database.p  pThe user needs to enter a comma separated list of phone numbers integers, and the query needs to tell the user which phone numbers from their list are NOT in the database.p  pThe only way I could think to do this is by first creating a subset NUMBERLIST that includes all of the phone numbers that I can join and then exclude that list from what I bring back from my customer database.p  precodeWITH NUMBERLIST AS      SELECT INTEGERS      FROM          SELECT level  1  8000000000 INTEGERS            FROM dual         CONNECT BY level lt 800999999980000000001          WHERE INTEGERS IN 8001231001,8001231003,8001231234,8001231235,...up to 1000 phone numbers  codepre  pThe problem here is the above code works fine to create my subset, for numbers between 8000000000 and 8009999999.  The phone numbers in my list and customer database can be ANY range not just 800 numbers.  I did this just as a test.  It takes about 6 seconds to generate the subset from that query.  If I create the CONNECT BY LEVEL to include all numbers from 1000000000 to 9999999999 that is running my query out of memory to create a subset that large and I believe it is ridiculously overkill to create a huge list and break it down using my IN statement.p  pThe problem is creating the initial subset.  I can handle the rest of the query, but I need to be able to generate the subset of numbers to query against my customer database from my IN statement.p  pFew things to remember  p  ol liI dont have the ability to load the numbers in a temporary table first.  The user will be entering the IN...,...,... statement themselves.li liThis needs to be a single statement, no extra functions or variable declarationsli liThe database is Oracle 10g, and I am using SQL Developer to create the query.li liThe user understands that they can only enter 1000 numbers into the IN statement.  This needs to be robust enough to select any 1000 numbers from the entire area code range.li liThe end result is to get a list of phone numbers that ARE NOT in the database.  A simple NOT IN... will not work, because that will bring back which numbers are in the database, but not in my list.li ol  pHow can I make this work for all numbers between 10000000009999999999 or all U.S. 10digit phone number possibilities.  I may be going about it completely wrong to generate my initial HUGE list and then excluding everything other than my IN statement, but Im not sure where to go from here.p  pThanks so much for your help in advance.

Negative 5486 pBackground on my situation is this Im a longtime Windows and Linux user and in the past few years Ive moved exclusively to Windows for my userfacing computers and Ubuntu server for my servers.  Im moving into a new research position where I cannot avoid using Mac.  However, I have set up all the Git repos on my server to be readwriteable using Smart HTTP and I let Apache handle my authentication.  All of the connections are over SSL.p  pI have not yet found a freeware client on MacOS well, any GUI Git client that will handle Apaches authentication.  So, I have two solutions to my problem.  The first is the identification of a freecheap Git GUI for MacOS that can handle HTTPS and authentication over HTTP.  If you know of one, awesome, please tell me.  However, I am still interested to know the answer to scenario 2.p  pThe second is to try to use gitosis to do my authentication using keys.  If I pursue that path, I need to be able to leave the HTTP authentication alone for legacy purposes and, frankly, to ease my key management my only having to manage the keys for my own Mac machines.  Im not wellversed enough in gitosis to know if I can push commits to a repo both through gitosis and using Smart HTTP.  If anyone can shed light on whether or not this would be possible, that would be great.  An example of how to do it would be exponentially better, and a solution that also allowed commits over SSH would be the absolute cherry on top.p  pThanks so muchp

Ive included the JQuery library, but my scripts arent writing the information to each posts div fields. Ive rationalized that this could simply be an effect of using a barebones theme Im building my own, but want to get the kinks worked out as I build it, but since I have all the requirements JQuery library in header  scripts I think it emshouldem still work.

Negative 5486 pI am having a strange problem.I have used customized navigation barfor which I have used another ViewController separately in my project which has ofcourse navigation buttons. As the device becomes active after stand by,it normally becomes active in portrait mode by default. And if we have held the device in some other orientation,it rotates to that orientation and every thing works fine. Even the navigation bar buttons.p  pNow here is the problem. If the device is held in Portrait mode after stand by,it freezes the navigation  bar buttons. As far as I have concluded,this is because the application gets active in portrait mode by default and since the device is also held in Portrait mode,it can not find any orientation to rotate and hence freezes the buttons.Except navigation bar buttons,everything works fine.And if I rotate the device,like I have said,Everything works fine.p  pDont have any idea,why this is happening.Can someone explainp

Negative 5486 pI have a question regarding applying Nokogiri into my Rails app. Im trying to collect baseball stats from a website and display the data into the view.

Is there a more efficient way to do this as in parse the data and then assign the data as a hash value, while the rank, team, league, etc. are assigned as hash keysp  pLastly, I had placed the Nokogiri call into my controllers, but I do believe there is a better way.

Negative 5486 pWe have several item renderers in our app, and weve noticed that the responsiveness of these UI elements to taps can vary greatly.p  pExamplep  precode    private function setupClickHandlingvoid              this.addEventListenerTouchEvent.TOUCHTAP, clickHandler         this.addEventListenerMouseEvent.CLICK, clickHandler           protected function clickHandlereObjectvoid              var eventItemClickEvent                           new ItemClickEventItemClickEvent.ITEMCLICK, true         event.item  data         event.index  itemIndex         dispatchEventevent      codepre  pWhen using MouseEvent.CLICK, sometimes a tap will not register as an actual click, strongeven thoughstrong the control spends a bit of time in the down state. This is most frustrating because the user believes that the control has been triggered, but nothing happens other than the grey background flash because a click event is not fired.p  pWhen using TouchEvent.TOUCHTAP, taps become strongtoostrong responsive, and sometimes the list item will get triggered while the list is being drag scrolled. I would think that the tap interface would register a tap no matter how brief the duration as long as the centerpoint does not move appreciably, and that as soon as enough movement is detected the tap will not be registered. Instead, what appears to happen is the tap event is registered on the down portion of the event, not the up.p  pSo, is there a way to either increase the sensitivity of Click, or decrease the sensitivity of Tap p  pOr ideally, always register a tap as an actual tapp

Negative 5486 pIve written a DLL library in C that consist of an API for communicating and manipulating our products. I want it to be used by QA guys in our team for building testing tools in .NET environment. As oppose to the principle of encapsulation one might suggest..., I would like the QA guys to be able to see the actual implementations of the API methods in the DLL for example, when they click go to definition in Visual Studio instead of just seeing the declarationsannotations from the metadata.p  pI dont want them to be able to change the actual DLL and I dont want them to build the DLL each time they build their new project, so I cant simply add the library project to their VS solutions.p  pOne theoretical way that crossed my mind is to maybe add the library project to each of their VS solutions as readonly if possible and also instruct them never to build it only build their own new project or maybe even lock it from building if possible. The problem is that ideally, I want them to be able to update the library project inside their VS solution to the newest revision from the version control system Im using Tortoise SVN in a press of one button somehow, along with the updated built DLL file updating the DLL file into their solution folder is easy and can be done even in a simple batch file, but Im not sure how to update the project files themselves....p  pOf course I would like all the above in some sort of a template, so that the preparations for developing a new QA tool would be quick and easy.p  pI found this issue difficult to formulate I hope I was clear enough, but Im sure this is quite a common issue when working in a team which Im not used to. Can anyone help me understand the right way of handling this issuep

Negative 5486 pi have a puzzle like program where you put blocks together in the right order to try and complete the puzzle. and when you are done you can hit the play button and then the program will make a little man walk across your blocks in the places where your blocks are.

Therefore, I want a additional second column that is either true or false 1,0 and corresponds to multiple keyword matches or a single one, respectively.p

Negative 5486 pMany a carefully crafted piece of Java code has been laid to waste by java.lang.OutOfMemoryError. There seems to be no relief from it, even production class code gets downed by it.p  pThe question I wish to ask is are there good programmingarchitecture practices where you can avoid hitting this error.p  pSo the tools at a Java programmers disposal seem to bep  ol lijava.lang.Runtime.addShutdownHookThread hook  shutdown hooks allow for a graceful fall.li lijava.lang.Runtime.freeMemory  allows us to check the memory available to the VMli ol  pSo the thought I had is could one write factory methods which before the creation of objects check if the system has adequate memory left before attempting to allocate memory For example in C, the malloc would fail and you would know that you had run out of memory, not an ideal situation but you wouldnt just drop dead from an java.lang.OutOfMemoryError aneurism.p  pA suggested approach is to do better memory management or plug memory leaks or simply allocate more memory  I do agree these are valuable points but lets look at the following scenariosp  ol liIm running on an Amazon micro instance li liI can allocate very little memory to my VM say 400M li liMy Java process processes jobs in a multithreaded fashion, each thread consumes a variable amount of memory depending on the parameters of the computational taskli liLets assume that my process has no memory leaksli liNow if I keep feeding it jobs before they are complete it will eventually die of memory starvationli liIf I set Xmx too high  Ill get swapping and possibly thrashing on the OSli liIf I set an upper concurrently limit  that might not be optimal as I could be limiting the accepting of a job which could be executed with the available RAM or worse accept a job that requires a LOT of memory and end up hitting java.lang.OutOfMemoryError anyway. X. Hope that helps explain the motivation of the question  I think the standard responses are not mutually exclusive to seeking a fault tolerant approach to the problem. li ol  pThanks in advance. p

I have looked at the explode function, but I am not sure that I really understand it. I also played with the strreplace but it didnt seem to do what I needed it to, or I just didnt understand the complete function. Also, I was advised to not use the preg functions.

Negative 5486 pI need to write a LinkedList in C, I defined the construct in the file as codestruct element  int value struct element  next code I also defined a head element. Both of these are not local, they are variables that persist throughout runtime. When I try to insert elements into the LinkedList using codeintcodevalues from outside, I need to wrap an codeelementcode around this codeintcode. I do this by creating a local variable codestruct element e   value 0 code. I make it the head if head is null, or else I append it using a forloop.p  pThe problem I figured is that the local variable codeecode of type codestruct elementcode is deleted upon terminating that function. So if I have my head point to codeecode, it will continue pointing to an unallocated point of memory since the local variable codeecode does not persist beyond the function call.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 5486 pIve been having a serious problem with handling the taphold event. Note that I only have this issue in IOS at the moment.p  pI have a jQuery Mobile application. In that application I have a list, when a taphold is invoked on one of those list items a modal popup is opened. The popup opens in the center of the window. When the user releases his finger from the screen a mouseup and mousedown click event is triggered on the element underneath the finger. When the popup is underneath the finger there is no issue. When the modal grey area is underneath the finger the popup immediately closes. This behavior is normal. What is not normal is the fact that these events are invoked. I could easily hack around it but its not in my nature to do that. Id like to know the cause.p  pI made a small fiddle to illustrate my issue but you need an iPad to test this.

It does goes to page 2 and 3 and so forth, but records in datatable remains the same for both datatable. If I remove either one of them then pagination works perfectly.p  pI have noticed that even filter is not working when I have multiple datatables. Both datatables are in a single form, they both do have two different ManagedBeans and both are of view scope.

Negative 5486 pI am having getting my tableview to scroll smoothly when loading in images from NSData. p  pSome background ... Im storing image NSData in Core Data using the allows external storage option so i dont think storing the URLs or something like that is the solution here. Further, I am storing two types of data, one high res with UIImagePNGRepresentation, and one low res with UIImageJPGRepresentation. I am loading in the low res images for my table view. The image property on the entry object is not stored in core data, its set after the fact. Here is how I am doing itp  precode UITableViewCell tableViewUITableView tableView cellForRowAtIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath               DMLogTableViewCell cell  DMLogTableViewCell [self.tableView dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifierLogCell forIndexPathindexPath]      [cell setGradients[[UIColor whiteColor], [UIColor lightTextColor]]]     Entry entry  [self.fetchedResultsController objectAtIndexPathindexPath]     UIImage entryImage  entry.image      if entryImage         cell.rightImageView.image  entryImage     else          NSOperationQueue oQueue  [[NSOperationQueue alloc] init]         [oQueue addOperationWithBlockvoid              UIImage image  [UIImage imageWithDataentry.photo.lowResImageData]             if image image  [UIImage imageNameddefaultImage.png]             entry.image  image         ]         [oQueue addOperationWithBlockvoid              [[NSOperationQueue mainQueue] addOperationWithBlockvoid                  DMLogTableViewCell cell  DMLogTableViewCell [self.tableView cellForRowAtIndexPathindexPath]                 cell.rightImageView.image  entry.image             ]         ]            return cell  codepre  pAny ideas on how to get this to run more smoothly Any help is greatly appreciatedp  pThanksp  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pThis has gotten me much closer, but there is still a little bit of jerkiness . . .  within cellForRowAtIndexPathp  precode    UIImage entryImage  entry.image      if entryImage         cell.rightImageView.image  entryImage     else          [self.imageQueue addOperationWithBlockvoid              UIImage image  [UIImage imageWithDataentry.photo.lowResImageData]             if image image  [UIImage imageNamedbillsmoduleIcon.png]             entry.image  image             [entry.image preload]              [[NSOperationQueue mainQueue] addOperationWithBlockvoid                  DMLogTableViewCell cell  DMLogTableViewCell [self.tableView cellForRowAtIndexPathindexPath]                 cell.rightImageView.image  entry.image             ]         ]      codepre  pthat preload method is in a cateogory on UIImageView and looks like thisp  precode voidpreload      CGImageRef ref  self.CGImage     sizet width  CGImageGetWidthref     sizet height  CGImageGetHeightref     CGColorSpaceRef space  CGColorSpaceCreateDeviceRGB     CGContextRef context  CGBitmapContextCreateNULL, width, height, 8, width  4, space, kCGImageAlphaPremultipliedFirst     CGColorSpaceReleasespace     CGContextDrawImagecontext, CGRectMake0, 0, width, height, ref     CGContextReleasecontext  codepre  pI think my next plan of attack is to mess around with the size of the images stored as mentioned in the comments or perhaps trying to not update the imageViews while the table is scrolling.

Negative 5486 pI know this has been discussed several times but yet Im getting crazy dealing with this problem. I have a form with a submit.php action. At first I didnt change anything about the charsets, I didnt use any utf8 header information.. The result was that I could read all the ,, etc correctly inside the database. Now exporting them to .csv and importing them to Excel as UTF8 charset also tested all the others results in an incorrect charset.p  pNow what I tried p  pPHP p  precodeheaderContentType texthtml charsetutf8 mysqligtsetcharsetutf8 codepre  pMySQL I dropped my database and created a new onep  precodecreate database db CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8generalci create table ... codepre  pI changed my my.cnf and restarted my sql serverp  precode[mysqld] charactersetserverutf8 collationserverutf8generalci  [mysql] defaultcharactersetutf8 codepre  pIf I connect to my db via bash I receive the following outputp  precode charactersetclient      utf8                               charactersetconnection  utf8                               charactersetdatabase    utf8                               charactersetfilesystem  binary                             charactersetresults     utf8                               charactersetserver      utf8                               charactersetsystem      utf8                               charactersetsdir        usrlocalmysqlsharecharsets  codepre  pA php testp  precodevardumpmysqligtgetcharset codepre  pGiving mep  precodeCurrent character set utf8 objectstdClass3 8  [charset]gt string4 utf8     [collation]gt string15 utf8generalci [dir]gt string0  [minlength]gt int1 [maxlength]gt int3 [number]gt int33 [state]gt int1 [comment]gt string13 UTF8 Unicode  codepre  pNow I usep  precodemysql uroot ppw db lt require.sql gt tmptest.csv codepre  prequire.sql is simply ap  precodeselect  from table codepre  pAnd again Im unable to import it as a csv into Excel no matter if I choose UTF8 or anything else.

Any hint or workaroundp  pE3 I found a workaround which is working with the Excel Import feature but not with double clicking the .csv.p  precode    iconv f utf8 t ISO88591 test.csv gt testISO.csv codepre  pNow Im able to import the csv into excel using WindowsANSI. Still annoying to have to use this feature instead of doubleclicking. Also I really dont get why UTF8 isnt working, not even with the import feature, BOM added and the complete database in UTF8.p  pComma separation turned out to be a mess as well.  1. ConcatWS works only partly because its adding a stupid concatws.. header to the .csv file. Also file test.csv doesnt give me a comma separated. This means even tho everything is separated by commas Excel wont notice it using double click. 2. sedawk Found some code snippets but all of them were separating the table very badly. E.g. colum street streetname number remained a streetname,number which made 2 colums out of one and the table was screwed.p  pSo it seems to me that Excel can only open .csv with a double click which  a Are encoded with ISO88591 and only under windows because standard mac charset is Macintosh b File having the attribute comma separated. This means if I create a .csv through Excel itself the output of p  precodefile test1.csv codepre  pwould bep  precodetest1.csv ISO8859 text, with CRLF line terminators codepre  pwhile a iconv changed charset with RegEx used for adding commas would look likep  precodetest1.csv ISO8859 text codepre  pPretty weird behaviour  maybe someone got a working solution.p

Negative 5486 pIm a total beginner with jQuery and I am having a lot of trouble with a responsive website Im designing. Their are 2 horizontal menus on the desktop site, when the screen size hits 657px and less I need the horizontal menus to become drop down menus. p  pI thought I had everything working until I realised that when the screen size was less than 657px and I opened and closedtoggled the drop down it would open and close in the larger sizes as well, which makes perfect sense but I have no idea how to stop it doing that, so basically what I need is that the dropdown that appears at sizes 657px and less toggles only, not the horizontal menus as well. p  pI tried adding a .show to the horizontal menus at 657 to make sure it always showed, but that just caused the contents of drop down menus to show before they were pressed .

Negative 5486 pIf someone is a operating system programmer or writing a system level library code, it makes sense to write a segmentation fault handler. Like, for example, OS programmer would write code send a signal SIGSEGV to that application process. OR a systems library programmer might handle that signal SIGSEGV and may undo the operations caused by the library code for creating segmentation Fault. But why would an application programmer in C need to write segmentation fault handler If he writes an handler, he has already corrupted some parts of memory. Can you give an instance, for an application programmer to handle segmentation fault and continue execution of the programp

Negative 5486 pIm writing a system to dropout certain field borders from a form image. The fields may have writing in them which I need to correctly keep even if the handwriting crosses the field border.p  pI have 2 images 1 color image converted to HSV colorspace and 1 blackwhite image that line up pixel per pixel these are produced by a scannerp  pI would like to remove pluck the field border pixels from the black and white image, given the  colors in the color image.p  pI have an advantage in that I know apriori the exact location of the field, and  the widthsheights of the field border lines.p  pMy current implementation consists of for each field, scanning the field border on the color image and calculating an average HSV value for that field border since I know exactly where the field border is, I only visit field border pixels, but I may also visit a few handwriting pixels if they cross the field border, the idea is that they wont skew the average very much.

Negative 5486 pAs far as I looked, theres no answered question about QTPs Ext. sdk on stackoverflow and almost anywhere else on the net there isnt even a appropriated tag for it..., so Im aware its unlikely I get my problem solved by asking , but whatever, it worth trying.p  pAnyway, before I lose the attention of anyone who never heard or used the Ext. sdk, maybe I will have more luck asking you to help me figure out how to locate the error log file QTP produces at runtime. I know such a file exists in the new UFT 11.5 version, but I couldnt locate it in QTP 10 or 11 For the record, I dont talk about QTPs Log Tracking feature, but about the meta error log of errorsexceptions produced by QTP itself.p  pNow for the question Im developing an extension for QTP to support native record and run tests on my application. Im currently able to import an object repository, and write test steps using The COM object testing agent I developed. Problem started when I was trying to implement the IRecordable interface Im getting the IRecorder object from qtp, and even able to use it as ISuppressor object to exclude redundant steps from being recorded, but all my attempts to record a step that is, to add new recorded objects to the repository, and add steps to the test simply failed.p  pThis is the code that Im usingp  precodepublic class MyTestingAgent      AutInterface.ITestable,      AutInterface.IRecordable      QTPInterface.IRecorder recorder     ...      public void AutInterface.IRecordable.BeginRecordingobject recorder              IRecordSuppressor recordSuppressor  recorder as IRecordSuppressor         recordSuppressor.SuppressMyTestingAgentId,              ltSuppressgtltItem typeHWND value[HWND] gtltSuppressgt.Replace[HWND], getMyAppHWND.ToString          this.recorder  recorder as QTPInterface.IRecorder         ...           public void recordNewObjStepstring parentName, string objName, string method, Object[] arguments               object[] objectHyrarchy  new object[]  findObjectIdobjName, findObjectIdparentName          string externalParent  null         string appDescriptionXml  getDescriptionXmlparentName, objName         try                      recorder.RecordMyTestingAgentId, objectHyrarchy , appDescriptionXml, externalParent, method, arguments             Trace.TraceInformationRecord successfully done.                  catch Exception e                      Trace.TraceErrorTEAAgent.recordSTElement   e.ToString                   ...  codepre  pIm pretty sure all the arguments I send with the call to Record are accurate. getDescriptionXml and findObjectId are used in different cases in the code, and works fine, the method name and argument are correct.p  pThe annoying thing is that the call to Record doesnt even throw exception, and I get Record successfully done. in the trace log. Needless to say no new object is created in the repository, and no step is added to the test.p  pAs I cant debug QTP, Im pretty much in the dark with what Im doing wrong. Thats why Im asking for help with finding QTPs log file, or any other approach that might shed some light on the subject.p

The error is not shown when I set the JavaFx runtime to JRE 1.7 but in that case my JavaFx code is compiled by JDK8 but it tried to run using JRE7 ending up with incomparable class version error . p  pNote that I need to use JDK 8 for my experimental project which needs some latest features , so moving back to JDK 7 is not an option.

Negative 5486 pIm using a plugin Paid Memberships Pro, but that shouldnt matter, and I need to overload a function in that plugin. Im writing a custom plugin that changes certain parts of the Paid Memberships Pro plugin. Most of this works well. I can write templates that take priority over their counterparts, but when I write a function I cant call it from the other plugin. I imagine this is due to security or something, and intentional.p  pMy question is is there a good way to overwrite certain plugin functionality from a different function I want to be able to update the original plugin and not lose functionality otherwise I would literally just overwrite it. If you need to see any code Ive got it handy.p

Negative 5486 pI have a codeSSRScode report which displays a summary table of records. After I click on one of the records, it goes to the individual report of the record which has multiple lines on it that are configurable.p  pNow I have to add a column in the summary table report that displays the line numbers that are checked on the individual report. There is already a scalar function in the database that is used to determine whether a line is checked based on the codeGUIDcode of the record and an internal label string given for the line. There is also a stored procedure that gets the line number to be displayed on the report from the database.p  pSo for getting the line numbers to display on the summary report, I am planning on calling a codeUDFcode for each record in the stored procedure that gets the records for the summary report. But there is a problem in this case since I cannot call a stored procedure from a function. I need to call the stored procedure that gets the line number to display for each record, since the line numbers can be be unique for different records.p  pI then thought of converting the function to a stored procedure but then that would mean I would need to call it for each record which would require a codeWHILEcode loop or cursor. I am not sure whether this loop would be the best possible solution for my case. I cannot change the stored procedure that gets the line numbers to a function since it is used by many other reports before this and would require making changes to the stored procedures of all those reports. p

Negative 5486 pI have created my own MoviePlayerViewController derived from  MPMoviePlayerViewController, I present it using the standard presentMoviePlayerViewController method  all works fine. On top of the movie player controller, I present another ShareThisMovie view controller when the user clicks some button after I pause the movie. I do this using presentViewController.p  pI dont know why but as soon as the new VC comes up, the underlying MoviePlayerViewController immediately fires MPMoviePlayerPlaybackDidFinishNotification, which I respond to by dismissing the entire VC hierarchy, so the user does not have a chance to interact with the ShareThisMovie controller.p  pEven if I ignore the notification, still the fact that the movie player fires it means that once the ShareThisMovie controller closes, the movie STARTS OVER FROM THE BEGINNING.

Negative 5486 pThis one might be a bit complicated. I searched for similar questions and found nothing that seemed relevant.p  pLet me start by establishing my database structure.p  pI have several tables, but the relevant ones are as follows img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comMqglP.png altMaster Tablep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comROaST.png altCard Tablep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.cometG0Q.png altDeck Tablep  pRight now I have the decklist stored as a string of codecardidcode delimited by a comma. I realize this is inefficient and when I get around to improving my code I will make a new table codetcgcardindeckcode that has coderelationidcode, codecardidcode, codedeckidcode. For now my code assumes a codedecklistcode string.p  pIm building a function to allow purchases of a deck. In order to give them the actual cards, I have the following query generated with the PHP it will actually be about 50 entriesp  precodedbgtquerywriteINSERT INTO  tcgcard      masterid, userid, foil VALUES      159, 15, 0,     209, 15, 0,     209, 15, 0,     318, 15, 0 codepre  pThis part is easy. My issue now is making sure the cards that have just been added can have their ids grabbed and put together in an array to enter in as a string currently, and as entries into the separate table once the code is updated. If it was one entry I could use codeLASTINSERTIDcode. If I did 50 separate insert queries I could grab the id on each iteration and add them into the array. But because its all done with one query, I dont know how to effectively find the correct cards to put in the decklist. I suppose I could add a dateline field to the cards table to specify date acquired, but that seems sloppy and it may produce flawed results if a user gets cards from a trade or a booster pack in a similar timeframe.p  pAny advice would be appreciatedp
Negative 5486 pIm uploading an app on the play store and I realize that google wants a 32 bits icon. So I realized that the icon I built with photoshop is 8 bits. I can easily get the 16 bit version as well, but with 32 bits I have a problem of getting the background color I want. My background color is burgundy and on photoshop, with 8 bits or 16 bits I can obtain the color using this hex value 800020 or these rgb values 128, 0, 32 however when I try to make a 32 bit icon and I try to select that color I get so many more confusing panels and the 128, 0, 32 rgb values isnt burgundy but some sort of pink color. Does anyone know how to get the equivalent of 128, 0, 32 in a 32 bit version Is there something Im missingp

Negative 5486 pMultiplication of two numbers can be algorithmically defined like so add the first number to itself a number of times equal to the value of the second number. Exponentiation of two numbers can be algorithmically defined like so multiply the first number by itself a number of times equal to the value of the second number. Thinking about those definitions for multiplication and exponentiation raises a few questions...p  pFirstly, can a class of arithmetic operations be defined by starting with addition as the fundamental operation I wrote up some haskell code to test that ideap  precodeorder1 x y  x  y order2 x y  foldl order1 x replicate y  1 x order3 x y  foldl order2 x replicate y  1 x order4 x y  foldl order3 x replicate y  1 x order5 x y  foldl order4 x replicate y  1 x codepre  pSure enough, the meaning of order2 is multiplication and the meaning of order3 is exponentiation. The english language, as far as I know, lacks words for orderN where N  3.

When we remove these entries, we dont have success even with the SSRS reports when running them directly on the SSRS machine itself. Were assuming the issue lies in the way the user credentials are passed to SSRS and the subsequent data source url connections are established. p  pOur datasource uses Windows integrated security and the account that we run within VS successfully is the same account that we run IE on the SSRS report server directly with success. Also this is the same account that were getting the above exception when trying to access the SSRS report from IE on a remote machine.p  pAnybody run into something like this before or have any ideas Weve looked in the SSRS logs but not finding them helpful yet. Note that we need to run the reports under the actual end user credentials, as these credentials need to be passed to the WCF service where we showfilter data based on permissions.p  pWhen setting Credentials stored securely in the report server true and storing my own account which I used for other successful tests, the remote link works for everyone. However this creates an issue because then all WCFXML requests are used under the context of my credentials. We need all requests to be made using Windows integrated security under the context of the calling user. Another question this introduces, is why if I store my credentials in the report does it work for all remote users and myself, but when setting the datasource to Windows integrated security that it doesnt even work for me  the same credentials. p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pIt seems this double hop issue may be what were experiencing a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4630609integratedsecurityonreportingservicesxmldatasourceIntegrated Security on Reporting Services XML Datasourcea.p  pSome articles which I found which look to have same issuep  ul lia hrefhttpsocial.msdn.microsoft.comForumssqlserverenUSb8ba854676e846dca96ebc61e847521fkerberoswindowsintegratedsecuritydoublehopbetweenreportserveriisandiis relnofollowhttpsocial.msdn.microsoft.comForumssqlserverenUSb8ba854676e846dca96ebc61e847521fkerberoswindowsintegratedsecuritydoublehopbetweenreportserveriisandiisali ul
Negative 5486 pI am trying to create organization charts using BasicPrimitives API. This particular API takes a div id or class and fills its content with charts dynamically. I want to add zoom in and out functionality which API does not provide, however, I failed to achieve it. What I want is mimicing viewport in computer games where everything inside should be scaled up or down and every part should be visible via scrolling. I tried codetransform scrollcode on div but it does not scale entire content. Actually, I am not sure if it does or doesnt but I cant reach majority of my charts by scrolling. Then I tried zoomooz API but failed again.

Negative 5486 pI have a c application that generates data every 1 second stock tick data which can be discarded after each itteration.  I would like to pass this data to a Coldfusion 10 application and I have considered having the c application writing the data to a file every second and then having the Coldfusion application reading that data, but this is most likely going to cause issues with the potential for both applications trying to read or write to the file at the same time p  pI was wondering if using Memory Mapped Files would be a better approach  If so, how could I access the memory mapped file from Coldfusion p  pAny advice would be greatly appreciated.

When the destination array is larger, codemmstreampscode is fasterstrong. Im not entirely sure why codemmstorepscode is faster in the first case, since I never use those values in the cache, but I get why codemmstreampscode wins out in the latter case. Its made for this situation write bytes to memory which you wont need immediately or ever.p  pHere are some results with a destination array 256 times larger than L3 cache in my case, 1.5GB, compiled with gcc 4.8p  pcodegcc4.8 stream.c o stream stdc11 O3 g3 ftreevectorize marchnative minlineallstringops ampamp .streamcodep  precodebench L3MASS, array 1610612736 bytes 402653184 floats, 0 remainder, 0x104803040 pointer warm up round...       6   20.81148 ms  MEMSET CHEAT       8   28.49419 ms  MEMSET PATTER     100  371.40385 ms  NAIVE  NORMAL      54  202.01147 ms  NAIVE  UNROLL      31  113.53433 ms  STREAM NORMAL      30  111.41691 ms  STREAM UNROLL      51  190.70412 ms  STORE  NORMAL      51  189.15338 ms  STORE  UNROLL      51  189.36182 ms  STORE  PREFET codepre  pSo what do we learn from this codememsetpattern4code is unbelievably fast.

that gcc generates to make it more or less the same as the one apple uses codememset.scode, label codeLVeryLongcode, i.e. 4 unrolled codemovntdqcode instructions in a tight loop. To my surprise, I receive equal performance as my functions that use codemmstorepscode codemovapscode. This perplexes me, as I would have expected it to be eitherp  ol lias fast as codememsetpattern4code presumably unrolled codemovntdqcodeli lias fast as unrolled codemmstreampscode codemovntdqcodeli ol  pBut no, it seems to be the same as codemmstorepscode, imagine that, maybe Im doing something wrong. Running objdump on the resulting binary confirms that it is using codemovntdqcode, which suprises me even more, what the hell is going onp  pBecause I hit a dead end there, I decided to step through the executable in a debugger and setup a breakpoint at codememsetpattern4code. Stepping into the function, I noticed that it does exactly what I thought it would do, a tight loop with four unrolled codemovntdqcodep  precode   0x00007fff92a5f7d2 lt318gt   jmp    0x7fff92a5f7e0 ltmemsetpattern4332gt    0x00007fff92a5f7d4 lt320gt   nopw   0x0rax,rax,1    0x00007fff92a5f7da lt326gt   nopw   0x0rax,rax,1    0x00007fff92a5f7e0 lt332gt   movntdq xmm0,rdi,rcx,1    0x00007fff92a5f7e5 lt337gt   movntdq xmm0,0x10rdi,rcx,1    0x00007fff92a5f7eb lt343gt   movntdq xmm0,0x20rdi,rcx,1    0x00007fff92a5f7f1 lt349gt   movntdq xmm0,0x30rdi,rcx,1    0x00007fff92a5f7f7 lt355gt   add    0x40,rcx gt 0x00007fff92a5f7fb lt359gt   jne    0x7fff92a5f7e0 ltmemsetpattern4332gt    0x00007fff92a5f7fd lt361gt   sfence codepre  pSo, what makes Apples sauce that much more magical than mine, I wonder...p  pstrongEDIT 2strong I was wrong twice here, Apples magic sauce is not that magical, I was just passing in an array that was 4x smaller than what I was passing to my functions. Courtesy to PaulR for noticing Secondly I was editing the assembly of the function, but gcc had already inlined it. So I was editing a copy that was never used.p  pstrongCONCLUSIONstrong p  pSome other things I found outp  ul liClang and gcc are really good, with the right intrinsics, they optimize a lot and clang even does a great job without intrinsics, when the SLP vectorizer is enabled. They will also inline function pointers.li liClang will replace a naive loop with a constant into a codememsetcode call, clearing up another confusing result I had.li linontemporal store i.e. stream is only beneficial with huge writesli licodememsetcode is really well optimized, it will automatically switch between regular store and nontemporal store stream based on the length of the array to write. Im not sure how much of this is true on platforms other than OSXli liwhen writing a benchmark, make absolutely sure the function does what you think it does, and that the compiler is not outsmarting you. The first case was my problem here, I had not supplied the correct arguments.li ul  pstrongEDITstrong I recently stumbled upon the a hrefhttpwww.intel.comcontentdamdocmanual64ia32architecturesoptimizationmanual.pdf relnofollowintel optimization guidea, if at all interested in these things, read some parts of this first start at 3.7.6, perhaps.p

Negative 5486 pHow much overhead each cachedDistributed file has in a mapreduce program I have a mapreduce program in which I need to have 50 cachedDistributed files of very small size, it seems that the overhead they have is much larger than the case in which I have only 1 cachedDistributed file.

Negative 5486 pIm using a CRichEditCtrl to edit a computer language, and on every change to it Im calling SetSelectionCharFormat on the current line of text as reported by LineFromChar1 to highlight the syntax.  EG comments in green, section headings in a bigger font, compilation errors in red, etc.  Note this language doesnt have multiline features such as a C comment where typing  on one line makes following lines part of a comment too for any given character change I only need to change the color of the current line.p  pIt all looks like its working fine.p  pHowever there are some weird issues.  One is, when multiple lines of text is selected from somewhere else, and pasted.  My OnUpdate is called but is naively assuming that the only line that potentially needs reformatting is the one returned by LineFromChar.  That suffices when the user is typing character by character, but it means that after receiving a multiline paste, the program only reformats the last line of the pasted text.  strongHow can it know where the emstartem of the insert wasstrongp

In this scope, codethiscode refers to codeelementcode instead of the class codeMyClasscode.p  pHowever, if on line4 of CoffeeScript, I replace codeelement.click gtcode by codeelement.click gtcode the line8 in JavaScript will become codethis.myMethodthis.valcode where codethiscode referring to myClass is stored in codethiscode before calling the function.

Negative 5486 pIm going to start a big 3d modelization project, and i need to choose a system to store my data. The 3dmodel in its raw format, before my engine process it, is made of billions of colored triangles. Inputs   Each 3dmodel will consist of a very large number of triangles  3 space points bigint x,y,z , and a color rgb .  If the INSERT is slow its not a big deal, but the SELECT must be as fast as possible  SELECT with some linear WHERE conditions .  Data consistancy is not important, if i lost a triangle or two in a model thats not very problematic.  i can make a table per object, so i can make it readonly and i can put some column indexes RDMS on it.p  pthere are my questions  Data structure  Many triangles will share the same dots. Should i save the triangles in one table like id x1,y1,z1 x2,y2,z2 x3,y3,z3 ,r,g,b  or a table for dots id,x,y,z and a table for triangles id,dot1Id,dot2Id,dot3Id,r,g,b   a join on billion rows will be slow i think, and with NOsql we cant even do a join if my memory is good...    p  pRDMS or NOsql  I think NOsql is good for what i need, does it do fast conditionnal Selects on very large data  RDMS can be good too because my data is very formatted and consists of integers, indexes can do magic here.p

Negative 5486 pBy googling it seems that it is not really recommended to use a table in order to implement a producerconsumer pattern. The most tricky part is having multiple consumers.br I am not sure why. If instead of having multiple processesthreads trying to claim records and we should make sure that they dont claim the same ones etc, isnt it the same to have a have a single consumer that fetches records, passes them to forked processes which do the processing and in the end update the relevant recordsbr It seems that this design has the same result as having multiple consumers but non of the disadvantages.br Am I misunderstanding something e.g. transaction wise, locking etcp

Negative 5486 pSay I work on a branch and make commit A. I make a pull request. While the PR is being reviewed I continue to work on the same branch. Eventually the branch is approved and merged into master. Now that I am ready with commit B, I want to make a new PR. I pull the latest master and rebase my branch on it. The question here is  since master contains commit A because it was approved from my first PR and my branch contains commit A, because I continued my work on it while my first PR was under review, will there be duplicate commits or not If yes, what is the proper way to make a commit B here  a new branch from the current branch, a new branch off of master and rebasing on the first branch or maybe interactive rebase with cherry picking before the second PR p

Negative 5486 pIm hitting some real issues with scope. It largely has to do with the fact that Ive never used php namespaces. I see the examples like this one, a hrefhttpmetah.chblog201405facebooksdk400forphpaworkingsampletogetstarted relnofollowhttpmetah.chblog201405facebooksdk400forphpaworkingsampletogetstartedap  pand I can get it to work perfectly. But due to the way I built my site Im using a lot of functions. Id like to create a global php object, then call it from within functions.p  pI had done this using the facebook api from 2011, which just had facebook.php, basefacebook.php and fbcachainbundle.crt, but I wanted to push forward using the latest version available.p  pIm allowing access to my site with facebook or twitter, so a user logs in, and it checks for an active site session, and if it cant find one, it checks for an active facebook session, which it then checks against the users database. The problem Im hitting it accessing I can create this session in my base code, but I cant seem to access it from within the login processing function. Ive been searching for about two hours, but Im just not sure what to look for at this point. If anyone can give me a sample of how to access the facebook objects within the function that are initialized globally, I can likely handle the rest from there.p  pEDIT It was a simple enough solution, just something I wasnt familiar with. When calling the object you need to express the namespace as well. So my call ofp  precodenew FacebookRequest  Does Not Work within a function  new FacebookFacebookRequest  Does Work codepre  pI still need to read up on this a bit, but at least I have a working solution.p

Negative 5486 pIts getting quite frustrating with Xcode 5 here. All Im trying to achieve is embedding some custom Cocoa frameworks into my project and create two versions of the app, one for the Mac App Store and one for a custom Online Store so that when building for the MAS therell be a folder called Debug MAS so I can distinguish it from the other version.p  pI embedded three frameworks into the project only god knows why only one project can have another one embedded at a time, to hell with this limitation and added their products in the Link binary with libraries and copy frameworks build phase. The finished built products are at the default location in the Library.p  pNow heres the thing  every time Im using custom build configuration files other than Debug and Release, the frameworks are NOT copied to the custom build folders but instead just go into Debug and Release regardless of any build options of the main app. Also, the frameworks are always built using Debug and are no longer connected to the current build mode test, archive, etc.. To cut a long story short, this is a huge mess with file paths and obviously a lot of bugs concerning custom frameworks and custom build configurations.p  pNow my question is  there has to be an official or working way of maintaining an Xcode project that is both distributed over the MAS and a custom online store two versions and has at least one custom framework embedded. How do all other developers have solved this problem, I feel like Im doing something fundamentally wrong and if I do, sorry for putting the blame on Xcode but somethings for sure Xcodes path management with external components is a chaos and the cause for unlimited mailing list and forum posts...p

An exercise I saw asks you to design a linked list class with 2 member functions and a default constructor add, isMember, and the LinkedList constructor. Add function adds a new node to the front of the list. isMember tests to see if the list contains a node with the value passed in to add.p  pMy issue is, I am creating the ListNode head in the struct, then I try to access it in the LinkedList constructor to set it to null, it is throwing me the error of undeclared identifier. even if I set it to NULL in the struct it gives me the same error. The error goes away if I write ListNode head  NULL in the constructor, but then my add method is still going crazy over the use of the undeclared identifier head. Heres what I got so farp  pLinkedList.hp  precodeclass LinkedList  protected     struct ListNode              double value         ListNode next         ListNodedouble value1, ListNode next1  NULL                      value  value1             next  next1                  ListNode head           Public Interface public      Class Constructors     LinkedList       Methods     void adddouble x     bool isMemberdouble x       Private Class Members private  codepre  pLinkedList.cppp  precodeinclude stdafx.h include LinkedList.h   Class Definition file   Class Default Constructor LinkedListLinkedList      head  NULL    Class Destructor LinkedListLinkedListvoid      ListNode nodePtr     while nodePtr  NULL              ListNode garbage  nodePtr         nodePtr  nodePtrgtnext         delete garbage        void LinkedListadddouble x      ListNode nodePtr, prevNodePtr     if head  NULL  headgtvalue gt x              head  new ListNodex, head          else              nodePtr  headgtnext          while nodePtr  NULL ampamp nodePtrgtvalue lt x                      prevNodePtr  nodePtr             nodePtr  nodePtrgtnext                   prevNodePtrgtnext  new ListNodex, nodePtr       bool LinkedListisMemberdouble x          tbd  codepre  pAny clues as to why this is would be a huge help.

Negative 5486 pIve been searching for a solution to this, which I thought would be trivial, and seems pretty much impossible. p  pHeres the situation I set up an AdWords campaign, ad groups and ads. I point them to www.mysite.com p  pOnce visitors arrive to my site through one of my ads, I want to know which exact ad they clicked on and campaign, as apparently the ad id isnt globally unqiue. Is this possiblep  pI first tried by enabling Destination URL autotagging, but seems like the gclid parameter is pretty much useless.p  pThen I looked at the UTMZ cookie, but it seems like at most correct me if this isnt the case, you get the campaign number is this even the ID in AdWords and the keywords searched or the ads keywords, one of those. Not anything I can uniquely identify the ad by, rightp  pFinally, I looked at ValueTrack, although again correct me if Im wrong, but this would mean manually changing the destination URL of each of my ads in AdWords, right Even doing this, Im not sure I can get something that lets me uniquely identify the clicked ad. Is creative what I want Its described in the docs as the unique ID of the creative, does that mean this includes the Campaign.Id and the AdGroupAd.Idp  pThanksp

Negative 5486 pIm recently trying to get into MySQL and have been setting up a test database on my localhost with a set of CSV files.

However, when I try to reimport the data and name it with the same name, there appears to be a naming conflict, as if the original file is still there.p  pIs there a way to find the original table and get it back up and running in PHPMyAdmin Or if not, is there a way to clear out the records of the old table and just restartp  pWhen I try to just rename the newly imported table, I get this error which doesnt seem very helpfulp  precodeError SQL query  RENAME TABLE mta.TABLE 9                   TO mta.calendardates MySQL said Documentation  1025  Error on rename of .mtatable00209 to .mtacalendardates errno 1  Unknown error  codepre  pWhen I delete the codetable.ibdcode file in my codeCxamppmysqldatadbcode manually, and try to rename the table, I get an error with duplicate foreign keys Id set up for the original table.

Negative 5486 pI am am trying to access a cached file that is stored in the apps internal storage. The app works like this, when the user is connected on the internet I fetch the HTML data on the fly and display the contentstrings in my list view and then I store the HTML data in the phones cache. What I want is to be able to access this data when the user has no internet connection. Hopefully this makes sense. Storing the data looks to be working fine, but accessing it as a HTML file seems to be challenging so I can read it and extract certain elementstags and assign it to an adapter on the post execute method.

Negative 5486 pim doing an optimization of parameters of a complex simulation. Im using the multiprocessing module for enhancing the performance of the optimization algorithm. The basics of multiprocessing I learned at a hrefhttppymotw.com2multiprocessingbasics.html relnofollowhttppymotw.com2multiprocessingbasics.htmla.  The complex simulation lasts different times depending on the given parameters from the optimization algorithm, around 1 to 5 minutes. If the parameters are chosen very badly, the simulation can last 30 minutes or more and the results are not useful. So I was thinking about build in a timeout to the multiprocessing, that terminates all simulations that last more than a defined time. Heres an abstracted version of the problemp  precodeimport numpy as np import time import multiprocessing  def workernum      time.sleepnp.random.random20  def main      pnum  10          procs  []     for i in rangepnum         p  multiprocessing.Processtargetworker, argsi,, name  process  stri1         procs.appendp         p.start         print starting, p.name      for p in procs         p.join5         print stopping, p.name  if name  main     main codepre  pThe line codep.join5code defines the timeout of 5 seconds. Because of the forloop codefor p in procscode the program waits 5 seconds until the first process is finished and then again 5 seconds until the second process is finished and so on, but i want the program to terminate all processes that last more than 5 seconds. Additionally, if none of the processes last longer than 5 seconds the program must not wait this 5 seconds.p

Negative 5486 pI may be coming from a different mindset, being primarily a C programmer. This question has to do with OOP in Python and more specifically pure virtual methods.

Now my problem is that emduck typingem is all good and I think I have grasped it. However, is it wrong to pursue more strict OOP in Python So I looked at the a hrefhttpsdocs.python.org2libraryabc.html relnofollowAbstract Base Classesa and specifically a hrefhttpsdocs.python.org2libraryabc.htmlabc.abstractmethod relnofollowabstractmethoda. To me all this seems to do is allow me to call the base class method with super. Is there any wayreasonin Python to make codespeakcode pure such that implementing a derived animal without speak would throw an errorp  pMy argument for such a pursuit would be when writing modules and frameworks that you intend people to subclass, this would self document for them the fact that they need implement the function.

Negative 5486 pI rewrote a news application overview  detail from FastQuery to Content Search. The performance gains were enormous, but i see some possible limitations, for which i dont know to handle in conjunction with the Page Editor.p  ol liWhen i use a fast query, i get an instance of a news even if there isnt a language version yet. In Lucene, i cannot find a result because i filter for the language and therefore the news detail is missing in the overview in the particular language.li ol  pstrongEDIT for question 1strongp  pLets assume that we have a solution with two languages English and German. I have an item which currently only exist in a single english version. When im on an overview page in German and want to find this item with an fast query the query does not matter, i will get this item back. In the wrong version, but i get it back. Now if im in Page Editor, i can go to this item and edit this in German, even if there is no version yet. The first click on the save button will create the first version for me.p  pWhen i want to find the item trough the Content Search, my natural way of query it is by making the same filter probably by template, path and some channeling or whatever AND a filter by the language property of the SearchResultItem, since i dont want multiple results for the same item. But since there is only a english version yet, the index only contains a single result in english and because of the language filter, i cannot find this item to call GetItem on it.p  pSince writing this question initially, i see two approaches to get around thisp  pa Remove the language filter in Page Editor mode and filter it afterwards somehow I dont know whether im able to get an item which i can edit in Page Editor in the German languagep  pb Create a Page Editor specific master search index which holds an entry for all languages in the solution for every item, even if there isnt any in the specific language. I can add a computed field to indicate, whether this result is a real item version or not to filter at some point if necessary. Probably im able go call GetItem on this and enable Page Editor capabilities.p  ol start2 liWith lucene, i cannot find the detail item in a currently nonexisting language version when i want to resolve it by its display name trough Lucene because there is no language version indexed yet.li ol  pstrongEDIT for question 2strong p  pThis goes hand in hand with question 1p  ol start3 liIn relation with Workflows, i see possible struggles with the Version which is indexed. Is the first Version in index, before you approve the version Otherwise the overview has no chance to show this item till it is approved in Content Editor.li ol  pHas anybody used the Content Search for Page Editor relevant actions and has some advice how to get around such problemsp

Negative 5486 pOn a Windows OS, I need a WinForms application to be able to access files readwritedeletemodify to a folder that the logged in user does not have access to.  Another way to say this is that the user should only be able to access the files when using the application.p  pIn order to accomplish this, we are going to allow the application to be configured in a way that it will impersonate a user that does have access to the folder when it is executing code that needs access to the folder.  At all other times, the application will be executing as the logged in user.p  pThe configuration settings for the application will be in a database.  Lets assume the logged in user has enough access to get the configuration settings from the database, therefore the application can load the configuration settings that include the username and password that are needed for the impersonation.p  pThe application will be ran on multiple PCs.p  pWhat method should be used to store the password, retrieve it, and then be able to authenticate with it to do the impersonation  Hashing, encryption, some other methodp

Negative 5486 pI am working on a site which allows users to include a URL to a site that they own. I am looking at a way to verify that the user actually owns this site, and isnt just claiming that they do. Some options that I have found through searching on here and google arep  ul liFile Uploadli liMeta Tagli liTXTCNAME DNS recordli ul  pWhile I, as a tech person, find these methods extraordinarily easy, it is safe to assume that marketing folks might have some trouble, or might not be allowed access to the server or control panel to do these things. p  pI have also seen some people suggest sending an email to an address on that domain, however, I think that that could pose some security problems, and be challenging if the user does not have a corporate address associated with the account.p  pSo my question is this Are there any easier ways to verify that a user owns a domain Something that doesnt require much technical knowledge Essentially as easy for the user as possible.p  pI have seen posts about openid and microid, however, it looks as though it also requires that a developer or other tech person go into the html files and make modifications, as well as upload files. p  pAny help would be much appreciatedp

Negative 5486 pI have a really simple question I have been asking many times before in different ways without getting the help I needed. So Im familiar with javascript and HTML, but a real noob when it comes to Angular and steroids. I have provided code in all my other question, but this time I want to try to just provide some pictures to illustrate my problem, and then maybe you guys have a smarter solution that what I think is possible. p  pSo its quite easy. The user starts in view 1 the first picture and based on hisher choice heshe will be forwarded to the next view picture 2. If the user clicks on the list element Button 1, heshe will be forwarded to picture two with the check boxes Button 1.1, Button 1.2 and Button 1.3. However, if heshe clicks on Button 2 in view 1 the first picture, heshe should be forwarded to the same view picture 2 as when heshe clicks on Button 1, only this time the values of the checkboxes should be Button 2.1, Button 2.2 and Button 2.3. How is this possible I use scope, I would like to change it dynamic, but after 1000 tries I have given that up and I would just see a solution work. Please helpp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comT3MaR.jpg altView 1p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comd02ym.jpg altView 2p  pstrongUPDATED WITH CODEstrong Ok so I added som code to this post, but please show be a working solution. The code example is almost the same as described above except some small differences. When you click on Button 1 in index1.html, the user should be forwarded to index2.html and the scope value should be button1. If the user clicks on button2, the scope value should be button2. However, the scope value stay static and does not change from the origin value which is index 2. The reason why I did not provide the code in the first case was because I just want a solution that shows the first picture below and by clicking on one of the options the user will come to the next view picture 2, and see the checkbox values based on which button heshe clicks. I do not want to create three html pages in order to show the different values for each button, I want to change the values dynamically.

A corresponding JSP would read the data of the valueStack and use JSTL to draw the HTML code.p  pIm in the process of revamping the code and i would like to revisit this logic to conform with the best practices in the industry.

So what is the best optionp  pIs it using emjavascriptem frameworks such as emjQueryem and move the drawing part to be clientside Do I know store the entire HTML code on the value stack somehow and display it in 1 shot Whats the optimal way in your opinionp

Negative 5486 pI have a codeUITableViewcode and one of my table cells is a codeUICollectionViewControllercode subclass that contains a codeUICollectionViewcode of displayed email addresses. When a user adds an email the codeUICollectionViewcode and its cell in the table view should get taller. p  pIm currently attempting to do this setting my codecollectionViewcode height constraint to codecollectionView.contentSize.heightcode in the codeLayoutSubviewscode method of my collection controllercell class.  My issue is that the cell in the codeUITableViewcode is not changing size when this happens.p  pI am assuming that this is because there is nothing telling the table view that the height of the email entry cell has changed. I am currently using dynamic cell sizing  or trying to anyway. Even, if I call codetableView.reloadDatacode this still does not work. Im wondering if  someone could give me a highlevel idea of how they would set this up.p  pUPDATEp  pI had a broken constraint issue that was part of my problem, but this is still not solved. While have proven that I can update the height constraint and that will update the size of the collection view, its out of sync. Its always one update behind. Heres an image showing the UICollectionView in green and you can see in the logs that Im updating the constraint yes, multiple times each time after adding a new item to the collection, but it is not updating the bounds of the view instance. In this example, if I were to add a new item to the collection, the next time I inspect bounds.height it would be at 149.5.

Negative 5486 pSorry in advance for the wall of text. I am creating a sort of novel type of chloropleth map, in which countries are shaded based on different categorical variables. The way Ive set up the app, I assign each country an RGB value based on its levels of each of the underlying variables and I want the map to show that RGB valueseems simple, right p  pUnfortunately, most of the map visualizations seem to want to do the color selection for me, rather than letting me choose. The best Ive been able to do is to treat the data as categorical and I end up with the same number of categories as countries. This worked fairly well for rworldmap. The problem is, Im developing this for web use, and Id really like to have tooltips so that you can hover over a particular country and this doesnt work with rworldmap, as its just a basic plot. Also, the rworldmap output is not particularly nice looking.p  pHeres the code I used with thatp  precodemapjoin lt joinCountryData2Mapdb, joinCodeISO3,    nameJoinColumniso, mapResolutionhigh  mapCountryDatamapjoin, nameColumnToPlotiso, addLegendFALSE,   catMethodcategorical, colourPalettedbrgb, mapTitleinputyear codepre  pI have experimented with googleVis, but I was having a lot of trouble with thatthe map would just disappear for no reason and Id have to reload the page, which I believe was an issue with the Shiny bindings in the googleVis package. I ultimately went with googleCharts a hrefhttpsgithub.comjcheng5googleCharts relnofollowhttpsgithub.comjcheng5googleChartsa, which clears up the problems with the bindings. p  pHowever, Im still having problems.p  pHeres the reactive functionp  precodeoutputmapviz lt reactive   db lt genRgb    list     datagoogleDataTabledb[ccountry, id],     optionslistlegendnone, projectionkavrayskiyvii, colorsdbrgb     codepre  pand heres the output callp  precodegoogleGeoChartmapviz, width100, height780px codepre  pAs you can see, theres not a specific way to clue the JS app that its categorical data, so as a result, its making a chloropleth with 182 different gradient stop points. Usually this works fine, but occasionally something weird happens and a country mysteriously ends up in an intermediate place between colors. I can always tell that theres a problem because certain countries are supposed to be specific colors for instance, the U.S. will show as 0000FF, and its pretty obvious when its not. Ive found that I can go to a different chart type the app uses other googleCharts types and then return to the map and usually its fixed. So its completely inconsistent.p  pSo with that in mind, can anyone suggest a better mapping tool that I can implement in Shiny that would work well for this purposep  pThanksp

Negative 5486 pI have one 2D CT image and I want to convert it to 3D image using Markov Random Field.

Put it was not really clear how the process takes place. Also, the cost minimization process was confusing to me what parameters are we trying to minimize And how this will lead to constructing a 3D image from the 3 2D orthogonal onesp  pCan anyone please explain to me how the conversion algorithm works using MRF in stepsp  pThank Youp

Negative 5486 pI am creating a PUT request through codecURLcode in codePHPcode running with codeNginxcode. The problem is when I do a PUT request all of the parameters I pass in codeCURLOPTPOSTFIELDScode are lost or do not exist in codeREQUESTcode.p  pI have set it up to do the codeREQUESTcode exactly like a codePOSTcode, but it does not work. When I change the request method to codePOSTcode everything works fine. It appears that codeNginxcode may be handling my PUT request as a GET instead of a POST.p  pI used codeWiresharkcode to look at my traffic and the requests between PUT and POST match, aside from the codeREQUESTMETHODcode string being different but for some reason.p  pMy location block is setup like this works fine with GET and POST, not REQUESTp  precodelocation folder      addheader AccessControlAllowOrigin       tryfiles uri uri rewrite       Uncomment to enable naxsi on this location      include etcnginxnaxsi.rules   location rewrite      rewrite folder. folderindex.phprequest1  codepre  pAny suggestions why Nginx may not be handling this request properlyp  pEDITp  pI should say that I tried this request in codeSoapUIcode as well, and if I tried checking POST QueryString to send as a POST, the parameters would not get there as well. If I left it unchecked, my parameters were received. This is what is leading me to believe PUT wants to behave like a GET request and not POST, thus why I may be losing the codeCURLOPTPOSTFIELDScode.p

Negative 5486 pI have a problem that I can not figure out it is probably an easy solution but I can not see it.p  pThe thing is, I have a program that generates all the possible combinations of numbers. The program ask for the size of the set and size of the subsets and generates all the possible combinations accordingly. So far so good ... now ...p  pI want to write some routines that check for some things in order to eliminate those combinations, one of those routines is the one who checks the array looking to exclude the sequences that exceed a given number of sequenced numbers, for this the program asks for the maximum of numbers in sequences allowed. For examplep  ul liSize of the set   10 stores in nli lisize of the subset 10 stores in kli limaximum of seq num 10 stores in maxpli ul  pthe array is called codecomb[]code codeintegercode it is initialized asp  precodefor i  0 i lt k i         comb[i]  i codepre  pbut I have trouble with the routine that exludes certain combinations.

But as it is the program is allowing the following combinationp  blockquote   p0,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9p blockquote  pand it should exclude it because 0,2 does not match the criteria, 2,3 and all thw following does.p  pAnother thing is that if I set the maximum allowed to 0 it takes all combinations as valid instead of none.p  pI know the fix should not be very hard and I am missing something really dumb.p  pI hope some insight from you probably insults too.p  pThank you p

Negative 5486 p I am trying to understand better how one can use the protected space in Go. I am coming form java which means that I can have values accessible via protected inheritance, as there is only composition here I wanted to make sure I was on the right path. p  pThe problem I want to set a value in a child implementation, but not expose a setter on the generic interface. p  pWhat is the best way to provide a setter to a subclass when there really isnt a hierarchy p  pThis means I wantp  precodetype Bottom interface      GetYouSome       rote things     SetSpeedint     DeliveryMechanism chan string  codepre  pNote that there is no codeSetDeliveryMechanismchan stringcode method. p  pI thought I would start with a base that implements the rote things, meaning that actual implementations will provide the GetYouSome method. Id also like these to exist inside different packages. There will be dozens of implementations and Id like to have the namespaces be sandboxed i.e. they can both use the const codeDefaultPortcode. p  pTo illustrate the problem I have made a little project. It is laid out like thisp  precode.  src      main.go      parent          child           child.go          parent.go codepre  pWhere in codechild.gocode we actually create a few types of codeBottomcode, but in codeparent.gocode we actually define the boilerplate code settersgetters. The problem is that I cant instantiate the channel anywherep  pIdeally an implementation would look like this p  precode parent.go  package parent  type Bottom interface      GetYouSome       rote things     SetSpeedint     DeliveryMechanism chan string    Intended to implement the boring things type GenericBottom struct      speed        int     deliveryChan chan string   func bot GenericBottom SetSpeedspeed int      bot.speed  speed   func bot GenericBottom DeliveryMechanism chan string      return bot.deliveryChan    child.go  package child  import parent  func Newspeed int parent.Bottom      impl  newComposite     impl.name  simple     impl.SetSpeedspeed       illegal not exported      impl.deliveryChannel  makechan string     return impl   intended so that we can seamlessly treat the Composite  as a Bottom type Composite struct      parent.GenericBottom     name string   func a Composite GetYouSome      fmt.PrintlnInside the actual implementation  codepre  pThere are two ways I can think to get around this. p  p1 create a child class that would wrap the codeGenericBottomcode class, passing through all the methods. That is le sad, and it also still has the problem that I cant access the codedeliveryChannelcode class directly. I would have to build a codenewcode constructor into the parent package, then explicitly set the instance in the child class. p  precode parent.go  func NewGenericBottom GenericBottom      return GenericBottom0, makechan string    child.go  func Newspeed int parent.Bottom      impl  newExplicitComposite     impl.name  explicit       now I can set the channel Nope      impl.gb  parent.GenericBottomspeed, makechan string      impl.gb  parent.NewGenericBottom     impl.SetSpeedspeed     return impl   this has to pass through each method type ExplicitComposite struct      gb   parent.GenericBottom     name string   func e ExplicitComposite GetYouSome      fmt.PrintlnInside the explicit implementation   func e ExplicitComposite DeliveryMechanism chan string      return e.gb.DeliveryMechanism   func e ExplicitComposite SetSpeedspeed int      e.gb.SetSpeedspeed  codepre  pOR 2 I can add a setter method on the GenericBottom. But anyone using the GenericBottom can just cast to that an access it right I wouldnt really be protected. p  pLike this p  precode parent.go   func bot GenericBottom SetChannelc chan string      bot.deliveryChan  c    child.go   type CheatersBottom struct      parent.GenericBottom     name string   func a CheatersBottom GetYouSome      fmt.PrintlnInside the cheaters bottom   func NewCheatersBottomspeed int parent.Bottom      impl  newCheatersBottom     impl.SetChannelmakechan string     impl.SetSpeedspeed     return impl  codepre  pWhat is the best way to provide a setter to a subclass when there really isnt a hierarchy p
Negative 5486 pI have been working on this issue for a little while now to no avail and I now turn to you all for some helpadvice.  The overall goal is to take the pairwise comparison output groups from a Tukey HSD function and directly add them to a grouped bar chart.  I have many iterations of these comparisons so the ideal goal is to have this center automatically as I run the script  no manual positioning based on coordinates if possible.  As of now I have a working bargraph.CI script, a working ANOVA, and a working posthov script  now I just need them all to play together nicely.  The issue I am facing is that the Tukey HSD group labels do not line up with the graphics bars ie. the output order does not correspond to the graphical order and they are not centered.  See the outputsgraph produced after my sample script.

Negative 5486 pfor a given webapp for example if facebook , i want to split into different modules p  peach module are strongonly depended on corestrong, strongand unaware of anyother componentstrong so that in future if i want to add or remove a feature all i have to do is develope this feature with its html and js and directives what ever inside it self, and just add dependency in core module and im good to go.p  pfor example app will contain  1. wall path  componentswall.js  2. user profile  componentsprofile.js  3. chat componentschat.jsp  pall need to know current logged in user details, so may be the core module will handle this by exposing user details to rootScope. core.jsp  pthen entire app user must be logged in to access, so i will let core.js handle all the authenticationp  pstrongEDIT TO NARROW DOWN Questionstrongp  precodevar core  angular.modulecore, [core.wall]  var wall  angular.modulecore.wall, [] codepre  pNow core strongDEPENDEstrong on wall, yet in my design , wall is the one that depends on core. yet at same time, strongcore routing is altered by core.wallstrong since wall should declare its own routing rules.p  pis this dependency injection doable  p
Negative 5486 pI want to save data in a database using a canonicalized IP address.p  pThe software, at this point, may get IPv4 or IPv6 addresses. I want to canonicalize by converting all addresses to an IPv6 address.p  pI know of codeinetptoncode to convert the string to a binary address. So I can try once with IPv6 and if that fails, try again with IPv4p  precodestruct sockaddrin6 sa int r  inetptonAFINET6, inputaddr, ampsa.sin6addr ifr  1       try again with IPv4     struct sockaddrin sa4     int r  inetptonAFINET, inputaddr, ampsa4.sinaddr       is there such a function     inetconvertipv4toipv6ampsa4, ampsa  char outputaddr[INET6ADDRSTRLEN] inetntopAFINET6, ampsa, outputaddr, sizeofoutputaddr   in C, I can do that if function returns stdstring  in C you cannot return a pointer on the stack, watch out return outputaddr codepre  pSo, I am looking for a function such as codeinetconvertipv4toipv6ampsa4, ampsacode to convert the codesockaddrincode to a codesockaddrin6code. Do we have such in the C libraryp  pIf we do not have such a function, would a solution be to use the ffff introducer as inp  precode try again with IPv4 stdstring ipv4toipv6ffff ipv4toipv6  inputaddr int r  inetptonAFINET6, ipv4toipv6.cstr, ampsa.sinaddr codepre  pI would hope that we have a way to convert an IPv4 codesockaddrincode to an IPv6 codesockaddrin6code function instead. I think it would be cleaner... I think that this last piece of code is not 100 secure I guess I can test the IPv4 conversion first and if it succeeds, then use the IPv6 conversion to make it secure. What a waste of time thoughp
