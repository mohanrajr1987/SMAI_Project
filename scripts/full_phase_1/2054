Positive 2054 pIve got an accelerometer hooked up at an FPGA that outputs data as integers between 0 and 65535. It is connected via USB to a QT program.p  pThe calibration is expressed in terms of 15mgLSB. I assume this means 15 millig per least significant bit  i.e a change output by 1 means 0.015g of acceleration.p  pThis premise works fine when the output is 3, 4 , 5 , 20  I can easily get the difference between the current and previous reading and use this to find the acceleration.p  pIm having difficulty when the output is close to zero, once it goes below zero it starts from the top i,e 65535 so ill have a series of data like 5 ,6 ,7 ,0 ,65533 , 65530 etcp  pFrom here I cant find the difference and use this as the LSB change as the difference between 2 and 65535 is 65533, whereas I would want a change from 2 to 65535 to represent 3.p  pWhat Im searching for is a piece of logic that can interpret the change in LSB from this series that goes from 0 to 65535, but in a  loop fashion, so once it dips below zero it is actually 65535, 65534, 65533 etcp  pHere is some codep  precodedouble xdiff  MotionData[0]MotionData[3] double ydiff  MotionData[1]MotionData[4] double zdiff  MotionData[2]MotionData[5] codepre  pThe first 3 elements of codeMotionDatacode are the current x,y,z, readings from the accelerometer, the last 3 and the next x,y,z readings.p  pAny ideasp  pThanksp

Positive 2054 pI had a strange error the other day at work. One of my developers was having an issue getting back an identity value from a SQL query using the following function. She queried the parent table and it returned an identity key of code32455code, then she used that key as the foreign key to return the child table, which kept returning 0. When we manually queried the SQL table, I noticed the Identity columns primary key had a value of code35335code. This lead me to think that the function below could not handle a value greater than code32767code. To get around this issue, I created a similar function but used long instead of int. From everything I read online it looks like int or int32 should have a maximum value of code2,147,483,647code. I cant figure out why this issue occurred according to the documentation I read.

Positive 2054 pDue to my original post being filled with flamers assuming that Im asking them to write my code for me and refusing to answer me at all, Im reposting my question.p  pI stress the fact that I am a total BEGINNER at Python, and that I am NOT here to ask people to write it for me, Im simply trying to ascertain the METHOD and some GUIDANCE on how to approach the problem, because Im having real difficulty approaching it, and everyone seems to think Im asking them to give me all the code I need, and Im not.p  pSo, on to my original question.p  pMy problem is as follows, I have made a mathematics quiz, that outputs the name and score to a text file. In this program, I plan to add some code at the beginning, which will run a list of options to compare and order the results from the text file. The program imports the entries into a list, and the format is as followsp  p[John  6, Bob  9, Billy  2, Matthew  7, Jimmy  2, Amy 9, Jenny  10, Michael  8]p  pPython recognizes this list as 8 items, perfect. It has their name, and then their score. The problem is that the specification Im working to requires me to be able top  pSort in alphabetical order with each students highest score for the tests.p  pAlso, by the highest score, and finally by the average score. Ive tried for many hours in order to find some code that can compare the integers within these strings to each other to find the highest score, and only print that one, but Ive had no luck. I feel like I will also struggle with the other 2 tasks, and wish for some guidance.p  pI thought about possibly using slices in order to take the integer into a separate value in order to compare them, but felt that this could make the code messy very quickly.p
Positive 2054 pSorry for a possible duplicate post, I saw many similar topics here but none was exactly I needed. Before actually posting a question I want to explicitly state that this question is NOT A HOMEWORK. p  pSo the question is how to convert a large integer number into binary representation The integer number is large enough to fit in primitive type Java long cannot be used. An input might be represented as a string format or as an array of digits. Disclaimer, This is not going to be a solution of production level, so I dont want to use BigInteger class. Instead, I want to implement an algorithm.p  pSo far I ended up with the following approach Input and output values represented as strings. If the last digit of input is even, I prepend the output with 0, otherwise  with 1. After that, I replace input with input divided by 2. I use another method  strongdivideByTwostrong for an arithmetical division. This process runs in a loop until input becomes 0 or 1. Finally, I prepend input to the output.

Positive 2054 pWhen I create models in core data, Im always a little perplexed by which integer type I should choose16, 32, 64.

Or, I have an incrementing case id number in another instance...cant imagine that going further than  few hundred people.  p  pAnd heres the deal...Its clear that true computer science folk think of numbers differently, taking into account factors like the architecture thats going to be processing the numbers, the space required to process and store the data, backwards compatibility, future proofing, etc.  When I think of numbers, I basically think of how large a value is being represented.  So when I get to that point of my process when I have to choose between three types of integers, I basically say to myself, Well, this is going to be a small number, lets just use the Int 16 option..., or Shoot, I could end up with a really big number here so lets use the Int 64 choice.

Negative 2054 pI have this big graph of edges and vertices in 2D space. The big graph is returned by a function computed in a C library. I am reading this graph and using it to compute all the intersections of its edges the lines segements. I use sweep algorithm. For detecting the intersection of two edges I have though some problems. I have 4 different methods according to which I test if two edges intersect and if affirmative I compute and retain their intersectionp  ol lipOne which test if the two edges are the diagonals of a polygon. that is the coordinates of the edges of one line inserted into the equation of the other line have different signs.pli lipOne which computes the intersection each time and check whether the found intersection is between the endpoints of both segments.pli lipOne which is the code from a hrefhttpworkshop.evolutionzone.com20070910code2dlineintersection relnofollowthis linka implemented in C though.pli lipOne which implements the first method proposed by Jason Cohen n a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions563198howdoyoudetectwheretwolinesegmentsintersect706262706262this questiona.pli ol  pThe problem reduces to this question Do two lines from A to B and from C to D intersect Then you can ask it four times between the line and each of the four sides of the rectangle.p  pHeres the vector math for doing it. Im assuming the line from A to B is the line in question and the line from C to D is one of the rectangle lines. My notation is that Ax is the xcoordinate of A and Cy is the ycoordinate of C. And  means dotproduct, so e.g.p  precodeAB  AxBx  AyBy. E  BA   BxAx, ByAy  F  DC   DxCx, DyCy   P   Ey, Ex  h   AC  P    F  P  codepre  pThis h number is the key. If h is between 0 and 1, the lines intersect, otherwise they dont. If FP is zero, of course you cannot make the calculation, but in this case the lines are parallel and therefore only intersect in the obvious cases. The exact point of intersection is C  Fh. If h is exactly 0 or 1 the lines touch at an endpoint. You can consider this an intersection or not as you see fit.p  pFor data that I created small data with double values I obtained good results with all the 4 implemented methods. When I use anyone of these methods implemented in C on the data from the big graph I get different results each time and not good resultsp  ol lipmethod returns much more intersections that I need all the points are on the graph but I get too many points.pli lipI always obtain 0 intersections no matter what.pli lipI get a lot more intersection than in 1.pli lipFor some example I get points which are not on the graph so not even the intersection. But for some examples I get the intersection points plus some other points.pli ol  pI have no idea where the problem can be. Any suggestion or any other idea on how to compute the intersection and test it moreover are ore than welcomed. thank you, madalinap

Negative 2054 pIm using Bazaar for version control, which Im very happy with.  In Bazaar every treeproject in source control is called a branch.p  pCurrently I have a main branch for the actual application, and a dev branch which houses some things like unit tests, as well as the user manual, etc.  This way, both the app and its associated tests are versioned, but separately.p  pHowever, I suspect that the way Im doing it is not the best way.  For example, if I were to create release branches from that main branch, then these release branches would get out of sync with the unit tests, unless I branched those in the same way.p  pCurrently, in order to create a snapshot of the application, I just export all files from that main branch and zip them up, because there is nothing in that branchs tree that isnt part of the app that will get sent to clients.p  pWhat would be a better way to do what Im doing  Should the unit tests go into that same main branch as the app, and if so what is a convenient way to easily create a snapshot ie the equivalent of a daily build which contains only the files that will be distributed with the appp  pemThank you all for your answers.  It was hard to decide whose answer to accept.  The solution Ive gone with is to have my tests within a tests subdirectory of my main tree I could easily strip that out later if I didnt want to distribute the tests.emp

Thusp  precodesomeInstance  MyClasstest123 lets say that constructor throws an exception someInstance.doSomething  will fail, name someInstance not defined. codepre  pI do have a situation though, where a lot of code copying would occur if i remove the errorprone code from my constructor.

If I remove the code from the contructor, id have 10 getters with copy paste code something like p  ol liis attribute really setli lido some IO actions to fill the attributeli lireturn the contents of the variable in questionli ol  pI dislike that, because all my getters would contain a lot of code.

Negative 2054 pEmacs has this seemingly very nice facility for building emautoloadem files based on magic source code comments autoload cookies of the form codeautoloadcode, which are to be placed on lines by themselves immediately above each definition to be autoloaded see a hrefhttpwww.gnu.orgsoftwareemacselisphtmlnodeAutoload.htmlAutoloadelispAutoloada.p  pThis would seem to be an ideal tool for maintaining autoloads for those little onefile packages that Emacs users inevitably end up installing in their profiles. Theres just one small problem this facility in GNU Emacs, anyway appears to be almost entirely focused on generating the codeloaddefs.elcode file for Emacs itself, with very little if any concession to other uses.p  pThis doesnt stop largish packages from using the codeautoloads.elcode machinery to build their own autoload files, but those that Ive looked at have a fair bit of rather hairy code devoted to making it do what is needed, though some of the hairiness might be due to GNU EmacsXEmacs divergence.p  pI think XEmacs is a bit better on this front, probably due at least in part to the fact that its official package system uses this machinery to make separate autoload files for each package. Hopefully GNU Emacs inclusion of the ELPA package system, which also uses this machinery, leads to similar improvements on their side.p  pSo, my question for you isp  blockquote   pHow should I maintain an autoload file for all code.elcode files in a directory, assuming they have all the necessary codeautoloadcode comments autoload cookies in place alreadyp blockquote  p[Hmm. block quotes look a lot coolor on tex.SE...]p  pIm currently using GNU Emacs 23.2.1, though the farther back an answer works, the better. For that matter, itd be nice if it would also work with XEmacs.p  pIm on Windows, but have MSYS installed alongside Emacs so shbash scripts will probably be fine as long as they dont call anything terribly exotic.p  p[Im not entirely certain this doesnt belong on superuser rather than on SO. If there is already a package that can take care of this with only a small amount of configuration, it probably does on the other hand if as I suspect there are only fairly rough snippets of code that might require a good deal of direct changes, I think it probably belongs here on SO.]p

Negative 2054 pI am using Yahoo BOSS and Bing APIs to provide search functionality to my site.

Negative 2054 pIve created a scrolling textview and have been able to add text and scroll just fine. The thing is, Im trying to add text at timed intervals and said interval can be adjusted by the user by hitting one of two buttons at the bottom of the screen. Everything is in place, but no matter what I do, I can only get it to display all of the text at once after the whole duration. Say Im trying to add text every half second for ten seconds. Running it results in nothing for ten seconds, and then everything shows up. Ive tried forwhile loops with counters and keeping track via system time. Nope. Recursion blows the stack in no time, which wasnt much of a surprise. Using wait or Thread.sleep dont work and wouldnt be ideal anyway as the buttons need to be live at all times.

But why the increment operation implemented before  codeprintfcode function is called , but not after the codeprintcode function only it is being incrementedp  p5.Maybe this is a side question , the book mention that codewhilecode is a structured statement , but why didnt I see a trailing codecode is append on it codewhiletestconditioncode.p  p6.It might sounds like a silly question , but sometime when I read some source code written by others , I will saw some of them place the open braces codecode of while loop on the same line with the codewhilecode , which causes it to be like that codewhiletestconditioncode . Is this a convention or is there any special reason for doing thisp  pbr  br  iThanks for spending time reading my problems , your help is much appreciated.ip

Negative 2054 pIve got shiro implemented and its working quite well.  Were now trying to implement envers to do audit logging of our entities in hibernate and that works as well.  One problem is were trying to get the subject making the change from shiro both in normal mode and in runAs mode.br Shiro gets the subject from the current thread and it seems that by the time envers AuditEventListener is called its already in a separate thread.  Where would be a good hook in hibernate to bind shiros subject to the current thread.  Shiro already has methods to do this but Id need to override hibernates event caller to bind the subject to the new thread somehow or add additional data to the event that would let me grab it later.p

Negative 2054 pIm developing a document based desktop app which writes a fairly large and complex file to disk when the user saves his document. What is the best practice to do here to prevent data corruption There are a number of things that can happen p  pThe save process may fail half way, which is of course a serious application error, but in this case one would rather have the old file left than the corrupted halfwritten file. The same problem will occur if the application is terminated for some other reason half way through the file writing. p  pThe most robust approach I can think of is using a temporary file while saving and only replace the original file once the new file has been successfully created. But I find there are several operations creating tempfile, saving to tempfile, deleting original, moving tempfile to original that may or may not fail, and I end up with quite a complicated mess of trycatch statements to handle them correctly.p  pIs there a best practicestandard for this scenario For example is it better to copy the original to a temp file and then overwrite the original than to save to a temp file p  pAlso, how does one reason with the state of a file in a document based application in windows Is it better to leave the file open for writing by the application until the user closes the document, or to just quickly get in an read the file on open and quickly close it again Pros and cons p

Negative 2054 pThis is a design question, I guess there going to be several suggestions I hope sop  pWe are a small travelling agent office, we are developing a software for our need. We have 30 clients on the local LAN, sometime later some other 510 from outside the office. This will be agents on route.  Would you create a WCF service for this scenario or just leave the DL in the client for direct access to the SQLp  pOur DataAccess Technology is EntityFramework 4.0 4.1, ALL clients are Windows 7 based.p  pAbout the travelling agents, wouldnt it be much more simple to just use a VPN for the agents connection  We have plans to supply our guides outside the office  with 3G tablets in about 1 year from now.p  pDeveloping clients with a DL is of course much more straight forward solution, but our plans for the near future will require some kind of service. The tablets application will have a much more simple interface and functionality. So maybe developing a WCF service dedicated for the tablets will be better Our first consideration is time, we are in great need for a working software.p  pWell, I hope I managed to share with you our thoughts clearly enough.p  pThank you for reading.p

Negative 2054 pBasically I would like some help on how to implement my idea. Any direction would be appreciated. Im not sure what languages I should be using, or if I need a MySQL database of some kind.p  pI want to make a tournament bracket. Ive read several posts on here about brackets but I couldnt find a solution.p  pI want to present the user with two options, pulled from a pool of about 16 choices. The two options would be randomly selected from the pool. The user will then pick the better or best option out of the two choices presented to him. After that matchup the pool would then be reduced to the remaining choices in pool, which would be 14. Immediately after the matchup, the user would then be presented with another two options, and the process will then repeat itself until all of the options in the pool have been used. There are 8 matchups in the first round, and then the matchups will continue until a single winner is selected. Also note that this bracket is not determined by score, but purely based on the user input which one of the two choices he likes better. The end result is a visual bracket of the sole winner, and the other losing options based on the user inputs. This would require storing the users input in a database I suppose.p  pHere is a viauallization of a classic a hrefhttpbetterbracketmaker.coma71c34d0e0fe4 relnofollowtournament bracketa with 16 options.p  pAnyway, I would like to know how to implementcode this.

For examplep  precodeListltRecipeNodegt[] recipeListByTag codepre  pThen, coderecipeListByTag[5]code would contain a list of all the recipes that have a 5 in the codeTagscode array.  I could then choose a random allowed tag and a random recipe within that tag in O1.p  pThe drawback of this approach is the size of this multidimensional array would be codeRecipes  Tagscode eg, the sum of Tags.length across all recipes, which starts to take up a lot of memory since Im storing a potentially huge number of recipes in this array.  Of course, since codeRecipeNodecode is a reference type, Im only repeating the 4byte pointers to the recipes, so this still might be the best way to go.p  pIs there a more efficient data structure or algorithm I could use to allow me to find a random recipe that contains a certain allowed tag  Thanksp

Negative 2054 pThere is no doubt that MonoTouch is one of the great crosscompilers. Similarly, SenchaTouch is one of the great HTML 5 Web App Kit.p  pI know a little about both of them however i made a very small application using MonoTouch for iPad, certainly MonoTouch and particularly with supporting XCode is awesome. But i did not tried SenchaTouchp  pThe advantage of using MonoTouch is that you can write c consequently i really enjoy it owing to the fact that i am a c developer In contrast a disadvantage of SenchaTouch for me is Java language and i really did not find any IDE like visual studio or xcode to DragampDrop UIs and it generate the Xml Codep  pMany are in this view that on account of the fact that MonoTouch is a CrossCompiler Consequently the applications developed by MonoTouch is not as fast as others like SenchaTouch .p  pI am really looking for a good advise from you, Your advise is welcome here.p  pRegards, S.

Negative 2054 pIm working on a Flex 3 app, implemented in Actionscript 3 and MXML, that includes an embedded video player, which is essentially a black boxI load it as a SWF from another site on demand, and I dont have access to its source code. It does, however, inherit from Sprite.p  pThe problem is that, when focus is on the Flash app, the video player is somehow receiving and processing keyboard events, even when the player itself isnt in focus. So when users are typing text elsewhere in the GUI, if they hit the space bar, the video pauses.p  pIve tried intercepting key events in the Sprites parent, and setting tabEnabled  false, tabChildren  false, and buttonMode  false on the Sprite, but nothing seems to work. Its as if the Sprite is getting keystrokes through an alternate Event path.p  pDoes anyone have any ideas on how I can prevent the player from receiving keyboard events or input events entirely Its fine with me if no input events reach the player, since Ive implemented my own, separate video controls.p

Negative 2054 pIm experienced in working with MVC web applications Zend Framework. When I was looking for a better description of each layer of the MVC pattern i.e. Model, View, Controller Ive found the Page Controller pattern that describes a similar behavior as you can see on the image belowp  pa hrefhttpmartinfowler.comeaaCatalogpageController.html relnofollowhttpmartinfowler.comeaaCatalogpageController.htmlap  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comhRvWp.gif altPage Controllerp  pThe MVC patternp  pa hrefhttpmartinfowler.comeaaCatalogmodelViewController.html relnofollowhttpmartinfowler.comeaaCatalogmodelViewController.htmlap  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comBoQLz.gif altMVCp  pSo far, the differences Im able to identify, is that the controller on the MVC pattern found on various applications actually implement business logic by deciding the actions upon the models entities. Sometimes those actions will be performed within the Repository Pattern instead of accessing the models entities directly. Thus you will find applications that have a service layer as a facade for the business logic, in such cases, controllers are thin and do not have any business logic, just presentation logic whereby the view is determined accordingly with the http request data and the data returned by the Service or Repository.p  pThe main question is. Does MVC implement the Page Controller pattern as it is Or the Controller on MVC is similar but have a distinct pattern p  pCalling a controller that does implements business logic a PageController doesnt sounds right, since its not just a page controller. But if we remove the business logic from the controller it does makes sense to call it a page controller.p

Negative 2054 pI released an app that uses Google LVL to the Market many months ago. For some reason, the app instance on my Nexus One development phone consistently fails validation, starting about 3 days ago March 25, 2012. Customers running the same version of my app do not report any failures. I tried toggling the licensing response via my Developer console  license check still fails. I uninstalled and reinstalled the app, to no effect. I install the app on my developer phone with adb, as Google doesnt allow me to purchase my own app through the Store. Im wondering whether this problem is due to recent changes in the MarketPlay app the phone is running version 3.5.15 of the Play Store.

Now i run to some problems when i want to use this on other platforms android, and iphone, using mono.p  pSo i came to the conclusion that i may need to remake te library using codeSystem.Drawingcode only. Because that namespace is available on all three platforms, and if i have googled correctly contains some functionally in drawing stuff on uis.p  pMy Questionsp  ol lipAm i correct in the fact that drawing contains drawing functions.. If so, how do i make a multi point line or polyLinepli lipAre there any allready available libraries that do the same using the System.Drawing namespace onlypli lipIf there are any plotting libraries that are available for only Android an MonoTouch than that will do aswell, because ive allready got a graph drawing function on my windowsphone, This will be my last resort. Because i want to keep the code behind the platforms mostly the same.pli ol

Negative 2054 pMy designer handed me a 640w design to work with on an iPhone and Android mobile website.p  pI got everything setup using the 320w measurements and replacing graphics with media queries based on pixel ratios.

My understanding is that the viewport meta exists to help handle this type of problem across multiple viewport sizes without having to define new media queries every time a slightly different viewport comes to market.p  pIf my approach is off please do share a reference to a better approach.  We have a mix of elements that need to be fluid and fairly fixed, which makes this a challenge but Im open to suggestionsp

Negative 2054 pIm using HTML5 appcache and mostly its working well.  However, sometimes, users browsers Chrome or Safari will hold onto the cached manifest file even though Im positive that the server has a brand new manifest file with a unique version number inside of a comment like with  app version 1.0.0.8 or whatever.p  pIn IIS version 6, the content expiration was set to 1 day, so could that be the problem  I cant seem to reproduce this issue which makes debugging difficult.  As a precaution, in IIS Ive changed the content expiration to expire immediately for the directory that stores the manifest file.  Could that explain why some browsers were hanging onto manifest files even when a new version was availablep  pI also noticed that when a browser was behaving this way, even if I deleted the manifest file on the server, the users browser would use its own cached copy of the manifest file which isnt supposed to happen if the file is no longer available in my understanding.p  pThanks,p  pAndyp

Negative 2054 pIve been attempting to learn Haskell independently in the last few weeks. Currently, Im trying to implement a goofy little guessing game where the computer chooses a random number and the user tries to guess it. If the user is wrong, the program tells the user either that the answer is higher or lower and allows the user to guess until they guess correctly. Ive got it working, but I would like to add the ability to keep track of the number of guesses that the user makes every game and report that number to the user once they guess correctly.p  pComing from an imperative background, the natural thing to do would be to have a counter that is incremented every time the user makes a guess, but you cant really do that in Haskell at least it seems like the statelessness and immutability of everything would prevent that.p  pI toyed with the idea of making the getGuess and giveHints functions take an extra parameter that represents the number of guesses so far lets call it numGuesses, and, on every call to those methods, pass numGuesses1.

Negative 2054 pI have an app that connects to our WCF service to send data. It uses custom user validation to authenticate the user.p  pCurrently, if the client time is significantly different to our servers the default 5 mins, then this error will fault the connection.p  pIm trying to catch this specific error so that on the server side, I can notify someone when it occurs and for the userclient that it occurred for.p  pI want to do this because allowing a larger clock skew wont solve our problem, there can be huge variation on the clients machine times. We dont control the client machines, however we can get them to update their time.p  pI have tried to put a generic trycatch in the validate method, and that does capture other exceptions like if the authentication fails  I throw a FaultException , it doesnt seem to catch the clock skew issue. Im guessing this isnt the correct place to catch this, but Im at a loss as to where else it should go.p  pI would implement passing the client time as part of the login as I have seen suggested elsewhere, however Im not able to do this at this time and really need a way to identify clients with incorrect datetimes in the meantime.p  pIf it helps, the service is using strongbasicHttpBindingstrong and its security mode is strongTransportWithMessageCredentialstrongp

Negative 2054 pI am looking for a way to nest select elements, meaning i would like to have the selection from the parent box determine the options found in the child box. For instance, the parent box will have a list of US states and the child box should have only cities found in the state selected, ie if the parent box is california, the cities available in city selection box should be only cities from california.  i know this is possible, but i am wondering what exactly is the easiest way to accomplish this type of nested selection boxes.  thanks.p

Negative 2054 pI needed to create a NSButton with both image and title but I didnt like any of the standard positioning methods in cocoa. p  pI decided to subclass the button cell and override the codeimageRectForBoundscode and codetitleRectForBoundscode to provide my custom positions. The problem is that the codetitleRectForBoundscode method gets called normally but the codeimageRectForBoundscode is not.p  pThe images in the buttons are shown normally so the cell must have a frame to draw the images I just dont know where it gets it from.p  pThe code is really simple. At the moment the only thing I did is to subclass NSButtonCell and override those two methods. Then in IB I choose an NSButton and change its cell class to my custom button cell.p  pHere is the codep  precodeimport JSButtonCell.h  implementation JSButtonCell   NSRecttitleRectForBoundsNSRecttheRect      NSLogBounds for title     NSLog,NSStringFromRecttheRect     NSRect titleRect  [super titleRectForBoundstheRect]     NSLogTitle rect     NSLog,NSStringFromRecttitleRect     return titleRect    NSRectimageRectForBoundsNSRecttheRect      NSLogBounds for image     NSLog,NSStringFromRecttheRect     NSRect imageRect  [super imageRectForBoundstheRect]     NSLogImage rect     NSLog,NSStringFromRectimageRect     imageRect.origin.y  20     return imageRect   end codepre

Negative 2054 pI have some HTML and CSS code which works really well in every other browser except IE10 and below, surprise surprise. Basically, theres a user profile page with their profile picture avatar.p  pWhen you hover over the avatar, some CSS tells a div inside the avatar div to change opacity from 0 to opacity 1. Inside that div, theres a Tweet button  embedded using an iframe and a hrefhttpsocialitejs.com relnofollowSocialite,a but thats irrelevant.p  pWhat happens in IE is that youll hover over the avatar and the button will display as its meant to, except when you hover over the Tweet button, it blocks the cursor from being on top of the avatar div, which causes it to disappear.

The grid object its a ComponentOne TrueDBGrid is owned by that form, and we have events set up to allow the form to tell the grid to ask for new data.  That call leads to this handler, whose purpose is to request an underlying data class to fetch a DataTable with records, and then to merge that table with the grids BindingSource which is a DataTable of the same schema.p  pMy problem  when the Merge method is called to merge new data into the grids newly emptied BindingSource again, a DataTable itself, a massive series of exceptions is being thrown.  Each exception instance is really a triad of exceptions  one System.Reflection.TargetInvocationException followed by a pair of System.InvalidOperationExceptions.  This results in incredibly poor performance, and this is what I must remedy.p  pI understand what is happening.  On the form, we are binding TextBox controls to the grids BindingSource using the controls Text property.  This binding is being fired every time a row is merged into the BindingSource.  That last part has not been observed, its a bit of a guess, but the sheer quantity of exceptions suggests it is the correct assumption.  That, and the fact that when I commented out all of the binding, the performance increased dramatically.p  pSo what I am asking for is help understanding how I can suspend this binding trigger.  As you can see, I have lines in the event handler that attempt to suspend it on the BindingSource.p  pI have already tried this as wellp  precodeg.SuspendBinding codepre  pIt made no difference.  In fact, I have tried suspending the binding on both ends of the equation, in the form and in the threaded refresh, but always all attempts have been fruitless.p  pCan you helpp

Negative 2054 pHere is the question p  blockquote   pRamu was a lazy farmer. He had inherited a fairly large farm and a nice house from his father. Ramu leased out the farm land to others and earned a rather handsome income. His father used to keep a buffalo at home and sell its milk but the buffalo died a few days after his father did.br   Ramu too wanted to make some money from buffaloes, but in a quite a different way. He decided that his future lay in speculating on buffaloes. In the market in his village, buffaloes were bought and sold everyday. The price fluctuated over the year, but on any single day the price was always the same.br   He decided that he would buy buffaloes when the price was low and sell them when the price was high and, in the process, accummulate great wealth. Unfortunately his house had space for just one buffalo and so he could own at most one buffalo at any time.br   Before he entered the buffalo market, he decided to examine to examine the variation in the price of buffaloes over the last few days and determine the maximum profit he could have made. Suppose, the price of a buffalo over the last 10 days varied asp      p10  12  8  11  11  10  12  15  13  10p      pRamu is a lazy fellow and he reckoned that he would have been willing to visit the market at most 5 times each time to either buy or sell a buffalo over the last 10 days. Given this, the maximum profit he could have made is 9 rupees. To achieve this, he buys a buffalo on day 1, sells it on day 2, buys one more on day 3 and sells it on day 8. If he was a little less lazy and was willing to visit the market 6 times, then he could have made more money. He could have bought on day 1, sold on day 2, bought on day 3, sold on day 4, bought on day 6 and sold on day 8 to make a profit of 10 rupees.br   Your task is help Ramu calculate the maximum amount he can earn by speculating on buffaloes, given a history of daily buffalo prices over a period and a limit on how many times Ramu is willing to go to the market during this period.p      pInput formatbr   The first line of the input contains two integers N and K, where N is the number of days for which the price data is available and K is the maximum number of times that Ramu is willing to visit the cattle market.

The integer on line i1, 1  i  N, indicates the price of a buffalo on day i.p      pOutput formatbr   A single nonnegative integer indicating that maximum amount of profit that Ramu can make if he were to make at most K trips to the market.br   You may assume that N  400 and K  400.br   Time limit  3sec.p blockquote  pIf we did not have the constraint k, we could solve this problem using a greedy approach, p  precode while c lt N    i  c    while price[day i] gt price[day i1] increment i    j  i1    while price[day j] lt price[day j1] increment j    add price[day j]  price[day i] to out profit    c  j1 codepre  pBut we cant use it here because whether to visit on a particular day or not depends on how many days we visited.

Negative 2054 pWe would like to do a partial explicit implementation of a interface in classes that are part of a class library.

However, the codeUtilitycode member we would like to implement explicitly and provide additional utility operations specific to that driver while accessed from the driver object.p  pWe are looking to understand any possible sideeffectsconsequences of partial explicit implementation in this scenario.

Negative 2054 pConverting a floatingpoint number to an integer using either a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarys2dy91zy.aspx relnofollowCInta or codeCTypecode will cause the value of that number to be rounded. The codeIntcode function and codeMath.Floorcode may be used to convert a floatingpoint number to a whole number, rounding toward negative infinity, but both functions return floatingpoint values which cannot be implicitly used as codeIntegercode values without a cast.p  pIs there a concise and idiomatic alternative to codeIntVar  CIntIntFloatingPointVarcode Pascal included codeRoundcode and codeTrunccode functions which returned codeIntegercode is there some equivalent in either the VB.NET language or in the .NET frameworkp  pA similar question, ema hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7684176Double to integer conversion issue concerning CInt and roundingaem was asked in 2011, but it simply asked if there was a way to convert a floatingpoint number to an integer the answers suggested a twostep process, but it didnt go into any depth about what does or does not exist in the framework. I would find it hard to believe that the Framework wouldnt have something analogous to the a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiPascal28programminglanguage29 relnofollowPascala codeTrunccode function, given that such a thing will frequently be needed when performing graphical operations using floatingpoint operands [such operations need to be rendered as discrete pixels, and should be rounded in such a way that roundx1  roundx1 for all x that fit within the range of  2311 even if such operations are rounded, they should use Floorx0.5, rather than roundtonearesteven, so as to ensure the above property]p  pIncidentally, in C a typecast from codeDoublecode to codeIntcode using codetypeexprcode notation uses roundtozero semantics the fact that this differs from the VB.NET behavior suggests that one or both languages is using its own conversion routines rather an explicit conversion operator included in the Framework. It would seem likely that the Framework should define a conversion operator Does such an operator exist within the framework What does it do Is there a way to invoke it from C andor VB.NETp

Negative 2054 pThere are numerous posts available on alternatives to global state, but I have lingering questions regarding implementation in a web environment.p  pIn ASP.NET, values stored in the session are practically global variables, but it seems you cant reasonably store, e.g., authenticated username, permissions, etc. across pages and events without resorting to the codeSession[]code collection. I would typically use dependency injection, but you wouldnt want to pass these values in the viewstateurl to the client.p  pSo I take that global state is a necessary evil in web development due to the stateless nature of HTTP and the answer is to just use it responsibly. What is a good facade pattern for implementation A static class such as the one below that just codegetcodes and codesetcodes values in the session doesnt do much to mask the global state.p  precodepublic class SessionWrapper      public static string UserName              get  return Convert.ToStringSession[UserName]          set  Session[UserName]  value           public static bool IsAuthenticated              get  return Convert.ToBooleanSession[IsAuthenticated]          set  Session[IsAuthenticated]  value        codepre

Negative 2054 pAs the title suggests, how do I kill a python thread from the main thread that created it I am currently running 3rd party code in a separate thread say thread 2 from my main thread and sometimes their code simply hits an infinite loop that is bounded with a blanket tryexcept statement. This means that I cannot simply raise an exception in thread 2 to stop it. Also, I cannot modify the 3rd party code to make their code more thread friendly. I understand based on the many questions from stack overflow that killing a thread is usually a bad pattern to use, but I believe this is the best solution in the current circumstance.p

Maybe the dll is not supposed to end on removal of the EA from the chart Could it be like that by design If so I can just set the flag to false manually I guess.p  pBut wouldnt that mean that if I add the EA to the chart again there will be another instance of the dll p  pIf anybody has a definitive answer though that would be great.p
Negative 2054 pIn a hrefhttpbook.realworldhaskell.orgreadsoftwaretransactionalmemory.htmlReal World Haskell, Chapter 28, Software transactional memorya, a concurrent web link checker is developed. It fetches all the links in a webpage and hits every once of them with a HEAD request to figure out if the link is active. A concurrent approach is taken to build this program and the following statement is madep  blockquote   pWe cant simply create one thread per URL, because that may overburden either our CPU or our network connection if as we expect most of the links are live and responsive. Instead, we use a fixed number of worker threads, which fetch URLs to download from a queue.p blockquote  pI do not fully understand why this pool of threads is needed instead of using codeforkIOcode for each link. AFAIK, the Haskell runtime maintains a pool of threads and schedules them appropriately so I do not see the CPU being overloaded. Furthermore, in a hrefhttpwww.haskell.orgpipermailhaskell2011April022735.htmla discussion about concurrency on the Haskell mailing lista, I found the following statement going in the same directionp  blockquote   pThe one paradigm that makes no sense in Haskell is worker threads since the RTS does that   for us instead of fetching a worker, just forkIO instead.p blockquote  pstrongIs the pool of threads only required for the network part or there is a CPU reason for it toostrongp

Negative 2054 pIn java, how can you overload the equality operation and print operation for a classp  pLike in python, you can do it by doing codedef eqselfcode or codedef strselfcode, but how can this be done in javap  pI know you can just manually make a method and call it like codeequalscode or something, but I wanted to find out if there is an actual one that works with the codecode operator and codeSystem.out.printcode function.p  pDoes anyone knowp  pThanks.p
Negative 2054 pI have a data set consisting of 200 99x20 arrays of frequencies, with each column summing to unity. I have plotted these using heatmaps like img srchttpimgur.comEYZuYfB.png altthis. Each array is pretty sparse, with only about 1720 values per 99 positions being nonzero.p  pHowever, I would like to cluster these samples in terms of how similar their frequency profiles are minimum euclidean distance or something like that. I have arranged each 99x20 array into a 1980x1 array and aggregated them into a 200x1980 observation array. p  pBefore finding the clusters, I have tried whitening the data using codescipy.cluster.vq.whitencode. codewhitencode normalizes each column by its variance, but due to the way Ive flattened my data arrays, I have some 8 columns with all zero frequencies, so the variance is zero. Therefore the whitened array has infinite values and the centroid finding fails or gives 200 centroids.p  pMy question is, how should I go about resolving this So far, Ive triedp  ul liDont whiten the data. This causes kmeans to give different centroids every time its run somewhat expected, despite increasing the codeitercode keyword considerably.li liTransposing the arrays before I flatten them. The zero variance columns just shift. li ul  pIs it ok to just delete some of these zero variance columns Would this bias the clustering in any wayp  pEDIT I have also tried using my own whiten function which just doesp  precodefor i in rangearr.shape[1]     if np.absarr[,i].std lt 1e8 continue     arr[,i]  arr[,i].std codepre  pThis seems to work, but Im not sure if this is biasing the clustering in any way.p  pThanksp
Negative 2054 pIm implementing a class in C that is supposed to monitor a directory, process the files as they are dropped then delete or move the processed file as soon as processing is complete. Since there can be multiple threads running this code, the first one that picks up the file, locks it exclusively, so no other threads will read the same file strongand no external process or user can access in any waystrong.

Negative 2054 pI have a windows application written in C. In this we used to check a file name is unicode or not using the wcstombs function. If the conversion fails, we assume that it is unicode file name. Likewise when i tried the same in Linux, the conversion doesnt fail. I know in windows, the default charset is LATIN whereas the default charset of Linux is UTF8. Based on whether file name is unicode or not, we have different set of codings. Since I couldnt figure it out in Linux, I cant make my application portable for Unicode characters. Is there any other work around for this or am I doing anything wrong p

On small data sets, this algorithm works fine.p  pIs this likely caused by the extreme recursion How do I handle this this is an essential part of my algorithm Ive done some research and have heard using a queue, for even just massive forloops. p  pWhat will reduce the likelihood of causing a stackoverflow p  pThank youp  precode   Fills all void cells in the 3D grid of Atom.     param x              The starting x coordinate   param y              The starting y coordinate   param z              The starting z coordinate   private void fillAllVoidCellsint x, int y, int z       Base case  If not BLOATEDATOM, BOUNDINGBOX,      or VOID then must be a cavity only 4 CellType      enum types.     if grid[x][y][z]  CellType.BLOATEDATOM          grid[x][y][z]  CellType.BOUNDINGBOX          grid[x][y][z]  CellType.VOID               Pop off runtime stack         return          else               Set to void then check all surrounding cells.         grid[x][y][z]  CellType.VOID          fillAllVoidCellsx  1, y, z  right         fillAllVoidCellsx  1, y, z  left         fillAllVoidCellsx, y  1, z  in front         fillAllVoidCellsx, y  1, z  behind         fillAllVoidCellsx, y, z  1  above         fillAllVoidCellsx, y, z  1  below       codepre  p EDIT  New Method Implemented Using a Stack per Roee Gavirel help Would this be a correct implementationp  precode                Fills all void cells in the 3D grid of Atom.             param x                  The starting x coordinate       param y                  The starting y coordinate       param z                  The starting z coordinate           private void fillAllVoidCellsint x, int y, int z              Point p  new Pointx, y, z          stack.pushp          while stack.isEmpty             p  stack.top         stack.pop           Base case  If not BLOATEDATOM, BOUNDINGBOX,          or VOID then must be a cavity only 4 CellType          enum types.

Negative 2054 pIm using the Application Initialization module for IIS 7.5 on a Windows 2008 Server for a web site thats mapped to port 8080. After setting up the warmup module, I was able to get it to trigger codeApplicationStartcode in codeGlobal.asaxcode, but not any of the pages I set up as initialization pages. When I added logging in codeApplicationBeginRequestcode, it showed that the warmup module was calling the pages on codelocalhost80code instead of codelocalhost8080code. I tried using codeServer.TransferRequestcode but that didnt work. Response.Redirect shouldnt work since these are dummy requests and there is no client to respond to the redirect. I was also wondering how any of this mattered at all, the web application was sent the request, as evidenced by triggerring codeApplicationBeginRequestcode, but then why didnt it proceed to render any of my pages Logging on codeApplicationErrorcode didnt show any errors on the requests to codelocalhost80code pages.p  pDoes anyone have an idea on what is causing this issue and how to fix itp

Previously I was looping through each player and creating their own cURL request at a time and storing the data  While this was a slow process, everything was working fine for weeks doing anywhere from 5001,000 players everyday.p  pAs we gained more players the cron started to take too long to run so I rewrote it using a hrefhttpswww.google.comurlsatamprctjampqampesrcsampsourcewebampcd1ampcadrjaampved0CDQQFjAAampurlhttpsgithub.competewardenParallelCurlampeiQQyfUemMdCB0QGd0YGgCgampusgAFQjCNGs6NfcD6sX8jm6xJMBgvZoL0WguQampsig2VNgEM3zszxnh5L0PRtSwampbvmbv.47008514,d.dmQ relnofollowParallelCurla cURL multi handling about a week ago. It was set to open no more than 10 connections at a time and was running perfectly  doing about 3,000 pages in 34 minutes. I never noticed anything wrong until a day or two later I was randomly unable to connect to their servers returning http code of 0. I thought I was permanently bannedblocked until about 12 hours later I could suddenly connect again. The block occurred several hours after the cron had run for the day  the only requests that were being made at the time were the occasional single file requests that have been working fine and left untouched for months.p  pThe past few days have all been like this. Cron runs fine, then sometime later a few hours I cant get a connection for an hour or two. Today I updated the cron to only open 5 connections at a time  everything worked fine until 56 hours later I couldnt connect for 2 hours.p  pIve done a ton of googling and cant seem to find anything useful. Id guess that possibly a firewall is blocking my connection, but Im really in over my head when it comes to anything like that. I am really clueless as to what is happening, and what I need to do to fix it. Id be grateful for any help  even a guess or a just point in the right direction.p  pNote that Im using a shared web host HostGator. 2 days ago I submitted a ticket and made a post on their forums, I also sent an email to the company and have yet to see a single reply from anything.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pHeres my code to run the multiple requests using parallelcurl.

But when I try to compile the same class in ant to get cobertura report, all the strongintegration tests are giving errorsstrong, but the unit tests are getting compiled.  Seems like there is some problem in compiling the integration tests alone, as the jUnit tests are running without errors. The test database also is not created as the integration tests dont get executed.p  pIs there some problem with the classpath Or am I missing something herep  pThanks in advance.p  pEdit I have just sorted out the issue.

Negative 2054 pI am developing a web application with ratchet.js and their push.js and have a very basic problem. My CSS code positions elements in one page in three columns. The user then can click on a navigation bar button to goto the next page. Once in the next page, the user can search for something. For the search, I handle it via a form and use jquery to detect when a form is submitted. However, when the form is submitted, the page is reloaded and push.js malfunctions.

Negative 2054 pJava has special markers on methods called codesyntheticcode and codebridgecode. p  blockquote   pa hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavasespecsjlsse7jls7.pdfJLS 13.1.7a, Any constructs introduced by a Java compiler that do not have a corresponding   construct in the source code must be marked as strongsyntheticstrong ...p blockquote  pSo synthetic methods are anything generated by the compiler and not represented in the source code, and although its not mentioned in that specification PDF very well, strongbridgestrong methods are used to typecheck generics. E.g. codeAnimal.interactWithCreature ccode gets a bridge method codeinteractWithObject ccode, which casts to Creature and calls the other method.p  hr  pWe have this API called Bukkit, which provides stable access to change how a Minecraft server works. One facet of the underlying implementation of the API aka vanilla Minecraft, which we have little control over, was recently forced in version code1.6.1code to change from integer values to float values. And in the interest of avoiding the difficulty of another change, we chose to change all our API methods to codedoublecodes.p  pSo, for examplep  precodepublic int getHealth public void setHealthint health  Must now be public double getHealth public void setHealthdouble health codepre  pHowever, as always, we would like plugins compiled with the previous version, code1.5.2code, to still work as much as possible  thats the whole point of the API.p  pThe codesetHealthcode is a solved problem, just introduce an overload. And currently, we have a method named codeINVALIDgetHealthVIcode which is being renamed at implementation compile emnotem API compile to codegetHealthVIcode, and this lets the old plugins continue to run.p  pHowever, when someone tries to extend our implementation of these renamed methods, they get compile errors from the doublynamed methods and overriding.p  pIs there a way to provide both the codeintcode and codedoublecode returns using a strongmanually  toolinsertedstrong synthetic or bridge method, strongthat wont cause compilation errorsstrong for those who try to change parts of our API implementationp

Negative 2054 pI would like to use rsync via ssh to copy files from emsourcemachineem to emdestmachineem both Linux boxes. Due to a security policy that is beyond my control, the files on emdestmachineem must be owned by emuser1em but emuser1em is not allowed to log in. I am emuser2em and can log in via ssh to both machines, emuser2em is in the same group as emuser1em, and both users exist on both machines. After logging into either machine emuser1em can become emuser2em by first doing emsudo sem no password prompt and then emsu user1em.p  pThe files typically have the following permissionsp  precodesourcemachine rwrwr user2  group1  file.txt  destmachine rwrwr user1  group1  file.txt codepre  pRsync always changes the ownership on emdestmachineem to be user2, becuase I am usingp  precodeusrbinrsync rlvx delete excludefrom ignorefile.txt rysncpathusrbinrsync pathtofiles e ssh user2destmachine.example.compathtofiles codepre  pas part of the rsync command.

Negative 2054 pSo heres the problem.  Im set to release an update soon for iOS that will address some problems in iOS 7.  In order to do this, I need to use some specific iOS 7 functionstypes.  Ive made absolutely certain that iOS 7 code will only be executed on iOS 7 and fallback to different code for pre iOS 7.  Of course, Im not allowed to submit with the current Xcode beta, so Im trying to compile with the current Xcode release.  However, I cant seem to find a way to disable this particular warningp  pcodeUse of undeclared identifier ltRedactedgt.code  p  pDoes anyone know of a way to disable this warning using a codepragmacode.  Ive tried a bunch of different ones includingp  pcodewcode, codeWeverthingcode, codeWallcode p  pbut nothing seems to work.p  pstrongUPDATEstrong Answer You cant, of course, because the compiler cant compile an identifier it knows nothing about.  My solutions was to simply create a codedefinecodep  pcodedefine ltredactedgt 1codep  pstrongUPDATE 2strong The answer below actually made it much easier.  I had already created a codedefine Xcode5Codecode, altcode that allowed me to execute code blocks conditionally.  By modifying it using the solution by maddyp  precodeif IPHONEOSVERSIONMAXALLOWED gt 70000     define Xcode5Codecode, alt code else     define Xcode5Codecode, alt alt endif codepre  pThis allows me to to easily hide blocks of code from the compiler by usingp  precodeXcode5Code     Code to be execute only with Xcode 5 ,      code to be executed in previous versions of Xcode  codepre  pThe main benefit of using the codedefine Xcode5Codecode is that Xcode will autocomplete it for you, which is a lot easier than using the full codeif IPHONEOSVERSIONMAXALLOWED gt 70000code, which Xcode wont autocomplete.p  pThis wont actually distinguish between iOS 7 and pre iOS 7 devices.  It only distinguishes what version of iOS the current Xcode can handle.  To distinguish between iOS devices versions I usep  precodeNSUInteger DeviceSystemMajorVersionvoid      static NSUInteger deviceSystemMajorVersion  1     static dispatchoncet onceToken     dispatchonceamponceToken,          deviceSystemMajorVersion  [[[[[UIDevice currentDevice] systemVersion] componentsSeparatedByString.] objectAtIndex0] intValue]          return deviceSystemMajorVersion  codepre  pThe above is Apples code, by the way. To dance around the NDA a little, Ill say that this helps with laying out a root controllers view, because that depends on both the version of Xcode youre using AND the version of iOS thats on the device.  And if youre trying to manage betas as well as production code, this can help a lot.  Once you can submit apps with Xcode 5, the codedefine Xcode5Codecode will no longer be necessary.p
Negative 2054 pWhen dealing with local codeDateTimecode values provided by a user, its quite possible to have a time that is either invalid or ambiguous, due to Daylight Saving Time transitions.p  pIn other languages and frameworks, there are often methods such as codeisAmbiguouscode and codeisValidcode, on some representation of the time zone.  For example in .NET, there is a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarybb396403.aspxcodeTimeZoneInfo.IsAmbiguousTimecodea and a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.timezoneinfo.isinvalidtime.aspxcodeTimeZoneInfo.IsInvalidTimecodea.p  pPlenty of other time zone implementations have similar methods, or functionality to address this concern.  For example, in Python, the a hrefhttppytz.sourceforge.netpytz librarya will throw an codeAmbiguousTimeErrorcode or codeInvalidTimeErrorcode exception that you can trap.p  pPHP has excellent time zone support, but I cant seem to find anything to address this.  The closest thing I can find is a hrefhttpwww.php.netmanualendatetimezone.gettransitions.phpDateTimeZonegetTransitionsa.  That provides the raw data, so I can see that some methods could be written on top of this.  But do they exist already somewhere  If not, can anyone provide a good implementation  I would expect them to work something like thisp  pre classlangphp prettyprintoverridecodetz  new DateTimeZoneAmericaNewYork echo tzgtisValidTimenew DateTime20130310 020000        false echo tzgtisAmbiguousTimenew DateTime20131103 010000    true codepre

Negative 2054 pWhat algorithm should I use to find the minimum flow on a digraph where there are lower bounds, but not upper bounds on flow Such as this simple examplep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comXVqf6.png altDiagram of simple example. Source ltjwezorek.comwpcontentuploads201309minflow.pnggtp  pIn the literature this is a minimum cost flow problem. In my case however the cost is the same as a nonzero lower bound on the flow required on each edge so I worded the question as above. In the literature the question would be what is the best algorithm for finding the minimum cost flow of a singlesourcesinglesink directed acyclic graph in which each edge has infinite capacity, a nonzero lower bound on flow, and a cost equal to the lower bound on flow.p  pFrom my research it seems that the main way people deal with any kind of minimum cost of any kind of network is to set the problem up as a a hrefhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiLPtypeproblem relnofollowLPtype problema and solve that way. My intuition, however, is that not having upper bounds on flow ,i.e. having edges with infinite capacites, makes the problem easier, so I was wondering if there is an algorithm specifically targeting this case using more graphy techniques than the simplex method et. al. p  pI mean, if all the costs and lower bounds are 1 as in the above... we are then looking for a flow that covers all edges, obeys flow rules, and isnt pushing too much flow through any path from s to t. This just feels like it shouldnt require an LP solver to me and indeed the Wikipedia article on min cost flows states that if the capacity constraint is removed, the problem is reduced to the shortest path problem but I think they are talking about the case in which the lower bounds are all zero.p  pAlso is there open source CC code for minimum cost flow anywhere From googling what is available I find that I can either set the problem up as an LP problem myself and solve with an open source LP solver, or I could use LEMON which provides several algorithms for mincost flow. The boost graph library does not include an implementation as far as I can tell.p  pIs there anything elsep

Negative 2054 pIm having a very unique dilemma regarding my appsubmission to the iOS AppStore.p  pIts an app for kids between 1.5 and 3 years old, the idea behind the app is that a voice guides you through learning animal names and their sounds. Nothing revolutionary here. The app has always been in Swedish, but ive now added support for English both the voice and texts.p  pSo, how should i handle this when submitting to the AppStore The default route would be localisation, but that will put to much faith on the device and its settings. Also, i absolutely does not want to include any settingsmenu in the app. If the customer download a swedish app, the app should be in swedish, regardless of the languagesettings on the device.p  pMy reasoning to exclude any settings in the app is that the target audience is small kids, and they should not have any other options then to play in the app. If id add flags to the start screen, the kids would click those and end up with a language they wont understand. Adding a languagesetting in the Settings.app, is an option. But does all parentsusers know that there are even appsettings in there Also, its pretty bad if a swedish user buy the swedish version in the AppStore, but gets the english version on their iPad just because the iPads language is in english.p  pThe other way to go about is to build targets and simply release another app to the AppStore, which is hardcoded to a specific language. The apps will have different names and the icon could differ slightly, such as backgroundcolours andor flags.p  pPros and cons with localisationp  ul li This is the preferred way by Appleli li  I can utilise the features of multilingual apps in the AppStore reviews etc li  Customer gets all language when they buy the app even though few, if none, will change language li  Parents need to be aware of that changing language on the iPad will change language on the App li  A swedish user with an iPad in english will get the english version li   It wont tell english users that there is an swedish version of the app available in the App Store. li  All assets for all language will be in the same binary, binary could become rather big.ul  pPros and cons with two apps different targetsp  ul li  Very clear for the customer, downloading it in swedish and the app will remain in swedish, regardless of language on the iPad. li li  The extra promotion in the App Store wont hurt customers see multiple language options in the App Storeli li  No settings neededli li  Only unique assets for the language, smaller binaries  faster downloadsli li  Same icon for two apps different names though and adding flags represents countries rather than language.li li  Apple could ban my entire developeraccount if they think that im spamming the App Store.li li  Customer need to buy two copies for two languages. Probably mute argument though, very few kids are multilingual at 2 years of age li ul  pAnyone with any similar experience that like to share Im really leaning towards both solutions here. p

Negative 2054 pBefore AJAX was popular, it was possible to convert between ids and entities by using a custom property editor and registering that in your controllers. So if you had a codeUsercode form backing object that contained a codeCompanycode, if codecompany.idcode was 5, Spring would call your custom property editor to so that you could go fetch the Company with id code5code and set it onto your codeuser.companycode property.p  pNow in the Ajax way of doing things, we have similar requirements. Instead of using a form backing object, we want to do an HTTP POST or PUT of a codeUsercode object as JSON data and have Spring automatically convert that JSON to a User object on our behalf. Spring has made this possible with the codeRequestBodycode annotation, and by using Jackson to marshall the JSON back and forth to Java objects.p  pThis is just a fictitious example. Imagine a codeUsercode containing a codeCompanycode object with the appropriate getterssetters.p  precodeRequestMappingmethod  RequestMethod.POST ResponseStatusHttpStatus.NOCONTENT public void createValid RequestBody User user      userService.saveUseruser  codepre  pSince property editors are a thing of the past as far as Spring is concerned, we are expected to use the new Conversion Service API. For my application, I have successfully created a factory that does what my old property editor did before  converting ids back to entities.p  pMy question is, how can I get Spring to call into the conversion service during or after Jackson marshals the JSON data I know it is possible to create a custom codeJsonDeserializercode, but I find writingtesting these to be a pain and lengthy process as I need to do it for a massive number of entities, and each deserializer would take anywhere from 60 to 200 lines of code each. p  pId love it if Spring could do the id to entity mapping for me on my behalf, just as it did for form backing objects. Is there a wayp

Negative 2054 pIve written an Eclipse plugin that depends on version 1.0 of another plugin lets call it WidgetMaster. Now, version 2.0 of WidgetMaster has been released with interface changes on many of the classes I was using. How can I continue to maintain one version of my plugin while supporting both versions of WidgetMasterp  pSo far what Ive come up with isp  ol liCreate my own interface for all the functionality provided by WidgetMaster. This means Id also have to create wrappers for all of their types I was using, which is a lot.li liFor each supported version of WidgetMaster, create a Fragment project that implements my interface and all the wrapper classes in terms of that versions API.li ol  pThis is going to be a significant amount of work because I currently use WidgetMaster classes throughout my plugin code. If I will only be depending on a specific version of WidgetMaster from my Fragment projects, I will have to move and wrap all of that. Also, 99 of the wrappers will be the same from version to version but Ill still have to copy them to each Fragment.p  pIs this the right approach or is there a better way to handle this situationp

Negative 2054 pfirst of all Im using CanvasRenderer for compatibility reason, I need to draw a lot of custom 2D shapes and lines which are formed by bezierCurveTo and drew by Particle, Ive referred many examples to find this way.p  pMy question is how can I select the shapes and lines properly, I ask on the Github site of Three.js and Mrdoob give this answerp  pParticles hit area is only a circle. If you want a custom shape youll have to write a second check pass on your own. Figure out where in the circle the click was and then check if youre hitting your shape maybe by checking the transparency of the pixel hit.p  pThere comes another question, if there are multiple custom lines in the circle, how can I know which one is being selected, I believe there is a way to get colortransparency of every pixel, but how can I know if the colortransparency of all the lines are the same. p  pOr is there any other way to do thisp  pAny comments will be appreciated , thanks p

Currently a 32bit floatingpoint representation is used, 16bit floatingpoint is proving insufficiently accurate.p  pMy initial thoughts are to try and store the data in a 16bit integer and to simply use the schemep  precodex216  1 [x is an unsigned short] codepre  pTo keep the algorithms largely the same and to retain use of the same floatingpoint hardware operations at least at first, I would ideally like to keep converting this fractional representation into floatingpoint representation, performing the operations, then converting back into fractional representation for storage.p  pClearly, there will be a loss of precision going back and forth between these two quite different, imprecise representations, but for our application, I suspect this might be an acceptable tradeoff.p  pIve done some research looking at what is currently out there that might give us a good starting point. The seminal What Every Computer Scientist Should Know About FloatingPoint Arithmetic article a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comcdE19957018063568ncggoldberg.html relnofollowhttpdocs.oracle.comcdE19957018063568ncggoldberg.htmla led me to look at a few others, Beyond Floating Point a hrefhttphome.ccil.orgcowantempp319clenshaw.pdf relnofollowhome.ccil.orgcowantempp319clenshaw.pdfa being one such example.p  pCan anyone point me to other examples of representations that people have used elsewhere that might satisfy these requirementsp  pIm concerned that any potential gain in exactness of representation were wasting much of the floatingpoint format currently by using this specific range will be completely outweighed by the requirement to round twice going from fractional representation to floatingpoint and back again. In which case, it may be required to do arithmetic using this fractional representation directly to get any benefit out of this approach. Any advice on this point would be helpfulp

Negative 2054 pWhen you implement a Runnable which uses a Handler and Looper, you end up with a blocking queue for the MessagesRunnables within the run method of your Runnable, because the loop method blocks.p  pLike thisp  precodepublic class Task1 implements Runnable      private Handler mHandler     private boolean mCancelled  false      private void init          Looper.prepare         mHandler  new Handler             public void handleMessageMessage msg                 process incoming messages here                              Looper.loop           Override     public void run          init          while mCancelled             try                 do stuff here               TimeUnit.SECONDS.sleep2             catch InterruptedException e                 handle exception here               e.printStackTrace                                public void cancel          mCancelled  true         Looper.quit       codepre  pIn the implementation of a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidosLooper.html relnofollowLooper.classa you see that the queue that is being used makes a call to queue.next which can BLOCK the running thread.p  precodepublic static void loop       ...     for           Message msg  queue.next  might block          ...       codepre  pThis is NOT what I want. I want to be able to use the runnable task to communicate with a handler send and receive Messages but also do the actual work within the run method, for example Bluetooth communications. When you call the connect method of a BluetoothSocket, this call blocks the current thread until a connection is made. See a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidbluetoothBluetoothSocket.htmlconnect2829 relnofollowBluetoothSocket.connecta for details. So this means I have a blocking thread as long as no connection is made. There is nothing to communicate without an established connection, so that is good. After the connection is established, I would like to exchange messages. If the threadrunnable gets cancelled, it also quit the LooperHandler.p  pNow my question is how do I use a LooperHandler within a Runnable and not let the Looper block the Runnable so that the normal code can be executed instead I only want to receive Messages through the Handler, not Runnablesp  pThanks for your kind help.p  pEdit too bad the Looper doesnt have a function like the BlockingQueue interface does, like take instead of next, which is blocking.p

Negative 2054 pI managed to get a delete button on a codeJFileChoosercode.  I figured out where to put the button.  In the process, I figured out, by messing with the codegetComponentscode method, where the codeJTextFieldcode where the file is searched for and replaced it with a codeJComboBoxcode.  The plan is to get it to list all the files that begin with the text in the first row, the only one that can be edited on the codeJComboBoxcode, otherwise its uneditable, and it could select an item in another row and it would set the text of the item at the first row to the text of that item.  And also update the codeJCombobBoxcode, though I dont think I implemented that part yet, though a simple method call should do that, but, anyway, I tried a hrefhttpwww.javaprogrammingforums.comwhatswrongmycode34289usingjcomboboxjfilechooserhavingproblems.html relnofollowpostinga this on Java Programming Forums. p  pIts showing the items in there, but its not letting it update with the typing.  It is, instead, showing all the items in the directory.  Also, when I go to select an item, it removes the first row and sets the text of the first row to the item.  However, it now makes the first row uneditable I think or does something wacky.  p  pIt is removing the first row because the brilliant people who developed the JComboBox class couldnt bother to make a codesetItmeAtObject item, int indexcode method, only a codegetItemAtint indexcode.  So I had to get the text of the item, put it in a variable, remove the item at the first row, and then readd at the first row an item that has the text of the selected item.  p  pI fear that maybe my code was too long, so I made it shorter, though even doing that today got no results at the Java Programming Forums, as the issue is with the codeJComboBoxcode and the File class and stuff.  p

Negative 2054 pFor a personal project Im currently working on, I use dependency injection and TDD as a basis for development. I also use factory classes to achieve the followingp  ul liSeparation of concern to separate the responsibility of object creation from application logic code. Single point of object creation.li liTo make unit testing easier as I can mock objects created by the factories.li liWiring to inject certain dependenciesservices into the objects it creates without the client code having to be concerned with doing so.li ul  pI understand that generally a factory class should be responsible for instantiating one particular type and that its usefulness really becomes apparent when dynamically creating different implementations of a type at runtime, however, Im not using the factories specifically for this purpose my reasons are those listed above. To avoid going overkill, I have not created a separate factory class for each class but I have used factory classes to instantiate groups of related classes, such asp  precodeinterface TagsFactory  NSObject     Create a new tag with the specified name   idltTaggt createTagWithNameNSString name     Create a new TagsViewController with preselected tags.

Negative 2054 pIn my project i use the jQuery input mask, for setting many masks. Recently i saw an issue were the text is not visible when the content is more and the width of the text field is small.p  pBasically if an input field is with a width of 100px and content is more than width of the 100 px, then the content will be automatically scrolling towards the left side. but in my case, the content is not scrolling and the text is added behind the text box.p  pAs per my knowledge, the issue should in the jQuery input mask plugin. If any have already faced this issue and fixed it, please let me know it.p
Negative 2054 pstrongHow can I send a custom SWT key event such that it results in the typing of that exact literal character without any conversionstrongp  pWe are making a custom onscreen graphical keyboard that allows for multiple possible layouts  QWERTY being the main one, but several others planned, including ones that visually simulate the iPhone keyboard layout or others that are nonstandard relative to the PC.p  pI would like to be able to send any arbitrary character of my choosing as an event, such that it will result in the typing of that exact character.  However, whenever I send an event with a given character, strongSWT seems to automatically interpret and convert it based on the systems keyboard settings and statusstrong, changing it to be capitalizedlowercase or using the shifted symbols depending on whether or not the shift key the real one on the actual keyboard, for instance is pressed.  For instance, passing the character T through a key event will result in either t or T depending on the shift key.  It performs similarly with the 4 character, doing either 4 or  based on shift.p  pThis is problematic, as I wish to perform the shifting of characters manually, and indeed may not wish to use the same shift characters as the standard QWERTY keyboard in any given case perhaps, for instance, I want  to be the shifted or function key version of R on a smaller, cellphonelike keyboard.  How can I use these events such that it does not assume the usage of QWERTY keysp  pThe documentation for the character field in the SWT events says the followingp  blockquote   pthe character represented by the key that was typed. This is the final   character that results after all modifiers have been applied. For   example, when the user types CtrlA, the character value is 0x01. It   is important that applications do not attempt to modify the character   value based on a stateMask such as SWT.CTRL or the resulting   character will not be correct.p blockquote  pThis makes me believe that it should not be converting my character as it is doing, as I am commanding it to use my final result.p  pI have created a simple, standalone example to demonstrate my issue please note that this is not how I am doing the actual Keyboard, and is only meant to highlight the key event issuep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comcW8gW.png altscreenshotp  precodeimport org.eclipse.swt.SWT import org.eclipse.swt.events.SelectionAdapter import org.eclipse.swt.events.SelectionEvent import org.eclipse.swt.events.SelectionListener import org.eclipse.swt.layout.GridLayout import org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Display import org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Event import org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Shell import org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Text import org.eclipse.swt.layout.GridData import org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Composite import org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Button  public class KeyboardIssueExample extends Shell      private Text txtTextArea     private Composite cmpButtons     private Button btnBigA     private Button btnBigS     private Button btnLittleD     private Button btnSix     private Button btnSeven     private Button btnDollah     private Button btnStar      private SelectionListener mainListener  new SelectionAdapter          Override         public void widgetSelectedSelectionEvent selE              Button b  ButtonselE.widget             char c  b.getText.charAt0             sendKeyc                           Launch the application.       param args           public static void mainString args[]          try              Display display  Display.getDefault             KeyboardIssueExample shell  new KeyboardIssueExampledisplay             shell.open             shell.layout             while shell.isDisposed                  if display.readAndDispatch                      display.sleep                                        catch Exception e              e.printStackTrace                           Create the shell.       param display           public KeyboardIssueExampleDisplay display          superdisplay, SWT.SHELLTRIM         createContents                  Create contents of the shell.           protected void createContents          setTextSWT Application         setSize450, 300         setLayoutnew GridLayout          txtTextArea  new Textthis, SWT.BORDER  SWT.HSCROLL  SWT.VSCROLL  SWT.CANCEL  SWT.MULTI         txtTextArea.setLayoutDatanew GridDataSWT.FILL, SWT.FILL, true, true, 1, 1          cmpButtons  new Compositethis, SWT.NONE         cmpButtons.setLayoutDatanew GridDataSWT.FILL, SWT.FILL, true, false, 1, 1         GridLayout glcmpButtons  new GridLayout7, false         glcmpButtons.marginWidth  0         glcmpButtons.marginHeight  0         cmpButtons.setLayoutglcmpButtons          btnBigA  new ButtoncmpButtons, SWT.NONE         btnBigA.setLayoutDatanew GridDataSWT.FILL, SWT.FILL, true, false, 1, 1         btnBigA.setTextA          btnBigS  new ButtoncmpButtons, SWT.NONE         btnBigS.setLayoutDatanew GridDataSWT.FILL, SWT.FILL, true, false, 1, 1         btnBigS.setTextS          btnLittleD  new ButtoncmpButtons, SWT.NONE         btnLittleD.setLayoutDatanew GridDataSWT.FILL, SWT.FILL, true, false, 1, 1         btnLittleD.setTextd          btnSix  new ButtoncmpButtons, SWT.NONE         btnSix.setLayoutDatanew GridDataSWT.FILL, SWT.FILL, true, false, 1, 1         btnSix.setText6          btnSeven  new ButtoncmpButtons, SWT.NONE         btnSeven.setLayoutDatanew GridDataSWT.FILL, SWT.FILL, true, false, 1, 1         btnSeven.setText7          btnDollah  new ButtoncmpButtons, SWT.NONE         btnDollah.setLayoutDatanew GridDataSWT.FILL, SWT.FILL, true, false, 1, 1         btnDollah.setText          btnStar  new ButtoncmpButtons, SWT.NONE         btnStar.setLayoutDatanew GridDataSWT.FILL, SWT.FILL, true, false, 1, 1         btnStar.setText          init           private void init          btnBigA.addSelectionListenermainListener         btnBigS.addSelectionListenermainListener         btnLittleD.addSelectionListenermainListener         btnSix.addSelectionListenermainListener         btnSeven.addSelectionListenermainListener         btnDollah.addSelectionListenermainListener         btnStar.addSelectionListenermainListener           Override     protected void checkSubclass           Disable the check that prevents subclassing of SWT components            private void sendKeychar c          sendKeyEventc, SWT.KeyDown         sendKeyEventc, SWT.KeyUp           private void sendKeyEventchar c, int eventType          txtTextArea.forceFocus         Event event  new Event         event.type  eventType         event.character  c         getDisplay.postevent        codepre  pAs you will find, the key events do not respect my own custom usage of capitalization, and instead uses its own.

Negative 2054 pI have searched the questions and there are similar questions asked but no solution that I think I can use. This question is similar to a fuzzy match...sorta. I need help with comparing two tables. One table is a company reference table and the other is a table that gets raw company data imported into it daily. The reference table is clean and has a company id associated with every single company. The daily data that is imported does not have a company id. What Im trying to do is have the daily data reference the Company Reference Table on companyname and update the Company Tables column companystate based on the companyname. Unfortunately, the daily data string for companyname coming in is not always the same each day. There can be various characters az, 09, , , . and spaces in front or after the actual company name with varying lengths daily so I do not believe I can use charindex to clean it up.p  pstrongCompany Reference Tablestrongp  precodecompanyid  companyname  companystate 1           Awesome Inc   NY 2           Excelguru    AL 3           Clean All     MI  codepre  pstrongCompany Tablestrongp  precodecompanyname              companystate abc123 Awesome   Inc      NULL Excel gur xyz987         NULL Clean All Cleanall        NULL codepre  pWhat I want it to do is this.

Negative 2054 pSo i have an app which needs some text based data in the image like a calendar app in which shows a calendar and Some User input text that a user has entered and it would appear in the image. I know its an NSString or some sort but what i dont yet understand is how do i implement this. Here is an examplep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comHeE4C.png altUser Textp  pAs you may see in this calendar app, the user set up a reminder in which displays data, what i want to do is place additional data like in the image itself also.p  pAnother thing is how would i add this kind of image to an app which should show a UITableView right below the imagep  pAny great tutorials on how to accomplish this  The image should be editable meaning it can be deleted like an icon on an iPhone where if i click edit, it would show a Delete icon.p

Negative 2054 pI read a lot about the new concepts in OpenGL 4 in comparison to OpenGL 1. My problem is, that in old GLSL I could use the predefined glVertex for calculations in my vertex shader out of the box. But in the current version 4.1 this has been removed.p  pThere are many questions about this, but no one gives an example in how to actually make the old glVertex available in the shader. I found some possibilities like codelayout location  0 in vec3 vertexposcode or codeglBindAttribLocationshader, 0, vertexposcode. But nowhere is explained where I got the knowledge in which index the current vertex position is stored. Actually I found a hrefhttpwww.opengl.orgsdkdocstutorialsClockworkCodersattributes.php relnofollowthis site with indexesa but that doesnt seem to work with the above mentioned code snippets.p  pMaybe someone could bring light in the dark and show a very little example.p

Negative 2054 pI am reading about web analytic and came across GTM and GA.p  pIt seems that GA is a service provided by google which generates reports and statistics on website traffic. As per my limited understanding in order to generate this reports we need to perform some type of tagging at our end.p  pIt also looks like that in GTM also we need to add some tags in our website.p  pSo, if both GA amp GTM are related to tagging what is the difference between them and why do we have two different products by google.p

Negative 2054 pIm trying to implement a producerconsumer queue using Dataflow for HTTP requests towards a web service. I found a hrefhttpblog.stephencleary.com201211asyncproducerconsumerqueueusing.html relnofollowan excellent post from Stephen Clearya, which is covering exactly this scenario. However, in contrast to Stephens post, I cannot mark the producer queue as complete since clients shall be able to enqueue requests throughout the entire lifetime of the application. The idea behind this approach that the client can constantly produce requests and the consumer is able to handle requests differently if more than 1 request is pending which is required.p  pThis requirement leads also to the fact that the consumption of the requests cannot be started after the production was finished, but have to be started the first request was enqueued. This also requires me to start the consumption in a nonblocking way otherwise it would lead to a deadlock. Ive done this via an asynccall which is not awaited, which unfortunately hampers the exception handling. Exceptions occurring during the consumption implementing the HTTP requests cannot bubble up since the call of the consumefunction is not awaited. Ive introduced and event to deal with this kind of problem, but this leads me to the following questionsp  ol liIs it a good idea to use an event to forward exceptions from the consumer to the client of the producerli liIs this a good idea to implement the producerconsumer pattern in that fashion for my use caseli liAre there potentially other approaches, which are more beneficial under the given circumstancesli ol  pTo make it a more explicit, Ive prepared a code example illustrating the problem I described abovep  precodepublic class HttpConnector       private BufferBlockltRequestPayloadgt queue      public delegate void ConnectorExceptionHandlerobject sender, Exception e     public event ConnectorExceptionHandler ConnectorExceptionOccured      public Taskltboolgt ProduceRequestRequestPayload payload              ifthis.queue  null                      this.queue  new BufferBlockltRequestPayloadgt             this.ConsumeRequestsAsyncqueue   this call cannot be awaited since it would lead to a deadlock                                                 however, by not awaiting this call all exceptions raised in                                                  ConsumeRequestsAsync will be lost                  return await queue.SendAsyncpayload           public Task ConsumeRequestsAsyncBufferBlockltRequestPayloadgt queue              whileawait queue.OutputAvailableAsync                      try                              var payload  await queue.ReceiveAsync                 do the HTTP request...                          catch Exception e                              ConnectorExceptionOccuredthis, e fire event to forward the exception to the client                              public class Client       private HttpConnector connector  new HttpConnector      public Taskltboolgt UpdateDataAsync              connector  object sender, Exception e   register an event handler to receive exceptions occur                                                      during the consumption of the requests                       handle exception or rethrow                    connector.ProduceRequestnew RequestPayload  produce a request       codepre

Negative 2054 pIm trying to put 2 elements side by side, where the second element has a fixed width of 100pixels, and the first one is to take up all the space beside it. So if the width is 900 pixels, it would be 800 pixels. p  pI tried doing it with percents but obviously different screen resolutions will mess it up completely. Basically, if youve done Android programming, what Im trying to do is have one object thats 100pixels, and the other to be of matchparent width to fill out the rest of the LinearLayout.

Negative 2054 pI have been testing this code for 2 months, it is the first exercise in my tutorial to learn AngularJS. The challenge is to count all .json files in a folder and increment it with 1 so that when I save another json file it will always have a higher ID then the previous one. I am having lots of trouble with web servers, first of all NodeJS does not seem to allow JSON posts in its standard configuration. So I have found a modified webserver.js from stockoverflow from a different question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions19618010resourcesaveisnotfunctioningresource.save is not functioninga a hrefhttpsgithub.comglepretreangularseedcommit9108d8e4bf6f70a5145b836ebeae0db3f29593d7diffd169b27b604606d4223bd5d85cad7da1 relnofollowhttpsgithub.comglepretreangularseedcommit9108d8e4bf6f70a5145b836ebeae0db3f29593d7diffd169b27b604606d4223bd5d85cad7da1a I have also tried the webserver.js that came with the tutorial  a hrefhttppastebin.comCkfh4jvD relnofollowhttppastebin.comCkfh4jvDa that seemed to work better. WAMP also did not work I could not get Apache to allow JSON posts.p  pProblem is the webserver posts the json or sees the json as an object not as an array, even though I have used isArray true and I use .query instead of .get. And I have tried many other things like transformResponse []. I need the array to get .length to work Also sometimes it GETS an array and POSTS an object which it later reads as object again it is getting really weird.p  pThe code works sometimes as posted or sometimes I need to change id to id.json, usually this means the server is retrieving it as an object again which is not what I wan but this differs between the 2 nodeJS servers.p  precode.factoryeventData, [resource, q, function resource, q              var resource  resourceappdataeventid, id id, getAll method    GET, isArray true             var number  resource.query             console.lognumber             return                  getEvent function                       var deferred  q.defer                     resource.getid 1,                     function event                          deferred.resolveevent                     ,                             function response                                  deferred.rejectresponse                                                  return deferred.promise                 ,                 save function event                      var deferred  q.defer                     event.id  number.length                     resource.saveevent,                             function response                                  deferred.resolveresponse                              ,                             function response                                  deferred.rejectresponse                                                                       return deferred.promise                                       ] codepre  pEDIT This seems to work better however I need to figure out how to put an .then into this servicep  precode.factoryeventData, [resource, q, function resource, q              var resource  resourceappdataeventid.json,                 id id, method getTask, q  ,                 query  method get             var number  resource.query codepre

Negative 2054 pIm having a very specific problem that I could not find the answer to anywhere on the web. Im new to python code C is my first language, so Im assuming this is just a semantic problem. My question is regarding objects that are declared inside the scope of a for loop. p  pThe objective of this code is to create a new temporary object inside the for loop, add some items to its list, then put the object into a list outside of the for loop. At each iteration of the for loop, I wish to create a NEW, SEPARATE object to populate with items. However, each time the for loop executes, the objects list is already populated with the items from the previous iteration. p  pI have a bigger program that is having the same problem, but instead of including a massive program, I wrote up a small example which has the same semantic problemp  precodeTest  class Example     items  []  objList  []  for x in xrange5     Object  Example      Object.items.appendFoo     Object.items.appendBar     print Object.items      objList.appendObject  print Final lists  for x in objList     print x.items codepre  pBy the end of the program, every item in objList even the ones from the first iterations contains p  precode[Foo,Bar,Foo,Bar,Foo,Bar,Foo,Bar,Foo,Bar] codepre  pThis leads me to believe the Example called Object in this case is not recreated in each iteration, but instead maintained throughout each iteration, and accessed every time the for loop continues.p  pMy simple question in python, how to I change thisp

I have an onClick event on a list item and depending on a boolean, I want to navigate to a specific page. p  pThe two possible pages the user will move to are almost identical. There is only one div which is different containing a list view. Originally I had only one page and I loaded the html of the div dynamically with javascript but the css was not being applied to so I decided to create an additional page which was almost identical apart from the one div mentioned above.p  pMy issue now is that whichever divpage I create first in my index.html will work for navigation but the second one will not i.e.p  pif I define the divs in the following orderp  precodeltdiv idpage1 datarolepagegtltdivgt  ltdiv idpage2 datarolepagegtltdivgt codepre  pthen navigating to page1 will work and navigating to page 2 will not. But if I switch the order in which I place the divs in the index.html page i.e.p  precodeltdiv idpage2 datarolepagegtltdivgt  ltdiv idpage1 datarolepagegtltdivgt codepre  pthen navigating to page 2 will work and navigating to page 1 will not.p  pHope this made sense.

Negative 2054 pI have two different elements, one is a contenteditable DIV as a directive where you can enter some HTML such as img tags and it will render automatically on keypress.p  pSecondly I have a textarea which is bound to an ngmodel and there I also want users to be able type HTML mainly img tags so it renders automatically however, I cant figure out if this is possible, if users type  tag then it saved as is.p  pWhat is the best solution to achieve what I want on the textarea Do I have to make a directie or is there a more simple solution where I can leverage the ngmodel variable that it is bound to.p  pFinal question, are there any security implications I need to be worried about so I handle input safely I.e. I do not want people to put script tags in there, just img tags, links and maybe some formatting HTML. I use santize service for the directive doing sanitizehtmlContent before rendering.p

Upon subsequent calling, the listener is called twice, thrice and so on ,it keeps on increasing.p  pThe callSecondFunc is called when the callFirstFunc has been executed, so the listener for this is also called as many no. of times the listener for broadcast in callFirstFunc.

Negative 2054 pAlright so my professor posted up an assignment but the reference code that were supposed to use is confusing me. He made a JFrame and inside that Jframe he put in a button, but the beanclass for that button is the subclass JHoverButton.Java which extends JButton. When I try to do that in my code, I cant get the Bean Class to be my own sub class. Ive tried custom creation code, Ive tried binding and Ive looked around on stack overflow but I couldnt really find an answer.

Negative 2054 pSituation I was running a mapreduce job for data aggregation, when the progress of reduce comes to near 96, the progress starts running really really slow. Before that magic 96 number, every 1 of reduce takes only couple of seconds. After that, every 1 takes minutes to finish, and further the progress goescloser to 100, slower the progress is. Most of time it just hangs in the 98, 99 and I waited hours for every 1 finishes.p  pAnalysis I checked the log messages for each tasktracker in HADOOPHOMElogs , everything is normal no exceptions, no errors. Altough it takes longer time to finish 1 of reduce when its near 100, reducer is running normally. Only thing worth noticing from the log is that the theres only reduce task left after around 96 of the progress, which means shuffle, sort are all done. p  pI guess theres a bug about job countersprogress report in mapreduce. Not sure.p  pAttempts I tried changed the number of reducers by setting mapred.reduce.tasks . for 36 reducers, that magic number is around 95 for 360 reducers, that magic number is around 97 for 3600 reducerswhich lowered the average reduce time, that magic number is around 99. I also tried to set mapred.tasktracker.reduce.tasks.maximum to control number of reduce slots that can run in parallel in one tasktracker, it didnt change anything either. p  pEnvironmentp  ul li6node cluster, for each node 15 GB memory, 8 core cpu li lidata size50 GB data input 17 GB data output  li liWhen running mapreduce, theres no overheat, no other errorsexceptions.li ul  pHeres an example of the weird progress I talked aboutp  precode141118 005252 INFO mapred.JobClient  map 100 reduce 83 141118 005254 INFO mapred.JobClient  map 100 reduce 84 141118 005302 INFO mapred.JobClient  map 100 reduce 85 141118 005305 INFO mapred.JobClient  map 100 reduce 86 141118 005312 INFO mapred.JobClient  map 100 reduce 87 141118 005315 INFO mapred.JobClient  map 100 reduce 88 141118 005317 INFO mapred.JobClient  map 100 reduce 89 141118 005319 INFO mapred.JobClient  map 100 reduce 90 141118 005325 INFO mapred.JobClient  map 100 reduce 91 141118 005331 INFO mapred.JobClient  map 100 reduce 92 141118 005339 INFO mapred.JobClient  map 100 reduce 93 141118 005351 INFO mapred.JobClient  map 100 reduce 94 141118 005407 INFO mapred.JobClient  map 100 reduce 95 141118 005509 INFO mapred.JobClient  map 100 reduce 96 141118 005643 INFO mapred.JobClient  map 100 reduce 97 141118 010413 INFO mapred.JobClient  map 100 reduce 98 codepre  pFrom 93, things get slower.

This a hrefhttpmunnabd.wordpress.com20131226retrivedatatokendogridbysearchinmvc relnofollowexamplea is so close but it converts data to JSON and uses client side click event.p  pThe primary problem is how to send data to the grid from button codebehind, server side and providing dynamic schema. As far as I understand, I can format search data as JSON and use some dynamic schema, but didnt get a clear picture.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 2054 pOn Chrome, it used to behave so that JavaScript can be immediately disabled.p  pFor example, if the JavaScript code has something that disables highlighting text andor copying the selected text, then if we disable JavaScript in the Developer Tools, then we can immediately select text and copy it.  And the same goes for right click for the context menu to Save Image As....p  pHowever, since a certain version of Chrome, it became that we cannot disable JavaScript like that.  We cannot even disable JS and reload the page.  We have to go to Chromes Settings, find JavaScript, and choose to disable JS in any page, and then reload the webpage.p  pDoes it actually make sense that disabling JS in Dev tool will still disable the highlighting and copying  I thought event handling is observer pattern and we register what function to run on click, for example, and disabling JS should disable this event handling mechanism and therefore it is as if JS is totally turned off  Then the current Dev tool behavior is actually incorrectp  pA side item of this question, how can we quickly select text and copy, andor right click to save images even if the page disabled it, without using any browser extension by disabling JS or by any other methodp  psomeone mentioned going to codechromechromesettingscontentcode in the question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13405383howtodisablejavascriptinchromedevelopertoolsHow to disable javascript in chrome developer toolsa and it is faster, but it still requires changing global setting and reloading the page content.p

Negative 2054 pIve a parent  child actor relationship to upload files to Dropbox. The relation consists of a supervisor actor and an upload actor. The supervisor actor defines a supervisor strategy for the upload actor. So if an upload to Dropbox fails the actor should be restarted as long the max number of retries was reached. In my application Im interested in the status of the upload. So I use the ask pattern to receive a future in success or failure case. Below you can find the current implementation of my actors.p  precode   An upload message.     param byte The byte array representing the content of a file.   param path The path under which the file should be stored.   case class UploadMsgbyte Array[Byte], path String     The upload supervisor.   class UploadSupervisor extends Actor          Stores the sender to the executing actor.       val senders ParHashMap[String, ActorRef]  ParHashMap         Defines the supervisor strategy       override val supervisorStrategy  OneForOneStrategymaxNrOfRetries  10, withinTimeRange  1 minute      case  DbxException gt Restart     case e Exception gt Stop            Handles the received messages.       override def receive Actor.Receive       case msg UploadMsg gt       implicit val timeout  Timeout60.seconds        val actor  context.actorOfPropsContext.getclassOf[UploadActor]       senders  actor.path.toString gt sender       context.watchactor       askactor, msg.mapTo[Unit] pipeTo sender      case Terminateda gt       context.unwatcha       senders.geta.path.toString.map  sender gt         sender  akka.actor.Status.Failurenew ExceptionActor terminated         senders  a.path.toString                An aktor which uploads a file to Dropbox.   class UploadActor Inject client DropboxClient extends Actor          Sends the message again after restart.         param reason The reason why an restart occurred.     param message The message which causes the restart.       override def preRestartreason Throwable, message Option[Any] Unit       super.preRestartreason, message     message foreach  self forward             Handles the received messages.       override def receive Receive       case UploadMsgbyte, path gt       val encrypted  encryptor.encryptbyte       val is  new ByteArrayInputStreamencrypted       try          client.storeFile  path, DbxWriteMode.force, encrypted.length, is         sender          finally          is.close            codepre  pMy question is now is there a better solution to tell my application that an upload actor failed after the specified number or retries. Especially the map to store the senders for the actors feels a bit awkward.p
Negative 2054 pI have 2 datepickers From date, to date or when a people arive at my hotel and when he leaves.

Negative 2054 pI am using the a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comyoutubeandroidplayerdownloads relnofollowYouTube API v3a and have the thumbnail videos for a codeListcode working nicely, and when you click a video in the list, it pops open a video box over the list that plays the video. This part works. But the video box was created as part of the codeAPIcode library Im assuming and so its fullscreen button in the box itself is clicked to get it into fullscreen. However, when I go to fullscreen, the video disappears and it is blank. No crash or anything, just blank. My initialization works fine. I get the codeerrorReasoncode value of codeSUCCESScode when I log it. So I dont know what else could be causing this blank.p  pIn some other codeYouTube APIcode code I find online, they use an codeIntentcode to go into fullscreen mode, but this is not what the video list class from the codeYouTubecode sample uses, so I dont know if thats needed somehow or not. The codeYouTubecode sample works perfectly as a list, it shows the video list and then seamlessly goes into fullscreen landscape mode when you click that tiny expand button on the video box. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comUJa5G.jpg altVideo box over list itemsp  pDoes it seem like I am missing anything Keep in mind, the video box and the fullscreen mode are both fragments, and are created programmatically, not in the codeUIcode. In my xml, you will just see fragment placeholders with a reference to the class where their codeUIcode is created.p  pThanks for your help.p  pstrongVideosActivity.javastrongp  precodepackage org.azurespot.cutelinks.cutevideos  import android.animation.Animator import android.animation.AnimatorListenerAdapter import android.app.ListFragment import android.content.Context import android.content.Intent import android.content.res.Configuration import android.os.Build import android.os.Bundle import android.support.v7.app.ActionBarActivity import android.util.Log import android.view.Gravity import android.view.LayoutInflater import android.view.MenuItem import android.view.View import android.view.ViewGroup import android.view.ViewPropertyAnimator import android.widget.BaseAdapter import android.widget.ListView import android.widget.RelativeLayout import android.widget.TextView import android.widget.Toast  import com.google.android.youtube.player.YouTubeApiServiceUtil import com.google.android.youtube.player.YouTubeInitializationResult import com.google.android.youtube.player.YouTubePlayer import com.google.android.youtube.player.YouTubePlayer.OnFullscreenListener import com.google.android.youtube.player.YouTubePlayer.Provider import com.google.android.youtube.player.YouTubePlayerFragment import com.google.android.youtube.player.YouTubeThumbnailLoader import com.google.android.youtube.player.YouTubeThumbnailView  import org.azurespot.R  import java.util.ArrayList import java.util.Collections import java.util.HashMap import java.util.List import java.util.Map  import static android.view.ViewGroup.LayoutParams.MATCHPARENT import static android.view.ViewGroup.LayoutParams.WRAPCONTENT   public class VideosActivity extends ActionBarActivity implements         OnFullscreenListener        The duration of the animation sliding up the video in portrait.      private static final int ANIMATIONDURATIONMILLIS  300      The padding between the video list and the video in landscape orientation.      private static final int LANDSCAPEVIDEOPADDINGDP  5     protected static final int RECOVERYDIALOGREQUEST  1      The padding between the video list and the video in landscape orientation.      private VideoListFragment listFragment     private VideoFragment videoFragment     private View videoBox     private View closeButton     private boolean isFullscreen     private boolean isPortrait       Override     protected void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState          super.onCreatesavedInstanceState         setContentViewR.layout.activityvideos          getSupportActionBar.setDisplayUseLogoEnabledfalse         getSupportActionBar.setDisplayHomeAsUpEnabledtrue          listFragment  VideoListFragment getFragmentManager.                 findFragmentByIdR.id.listfragment         videoFragment  VideoFragment getFragmentManager.findFragmentById                         R.id.videofragmentcontainer          videoBox  findViewByIdR.id.videobox         closeButton  findViewByIdR.id.closebutton          videoBox.setVisibilityView.INVISIBLE          layout          checkYouTubeApi            private void checkYouTubeApi          YouTubeInitializationResult errorReason                  YouTubeApiServiceUtil.isYouTubeApiServiceAvailablethis         Log.eERROR RESULT, Error initialization result is   errorReason         if errorReason.isUserRecoverableError              errorReason.getErrorDialogthis, RECOVERYDIALOGREQUEST.show          else if errorReason  YouTubeInitializationResult.SUCCESS             String errorMessage  String.formatgetStringR.string.errorplayer,                     errorReason.toString             Toast.makeTextthis, errorMessage, Toast.LENGTHLONG.show                    Override     protected void onActivityResultint requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data           if requestCode  RECOVERYDIALOGREQUEST               Recreate the activity if user performed a recovery action             recreate                    Override     public void onConfigurationChangedConfiguration newConfig          super.onConfigurationChangednewConfig          layout           Override     public void onFullscreenboolean isFullscreen          this.isFullscreen  isFullscreen          layout                  Sets up the layout programatically for the three different states.

Negative 2054 pThe question is fairly straightforward.Suppose you run a javascript in html file with the following codep  precodedocument.write... codepre  p... can be anything syntactically acceptable.We know that this calls the write method of the document object. This means a document object is already made and loaded into the RAM for use. Here are the points I want be clear aboutp  ol lipWhere is the document DOM object created Knowing the DOM Model applies to multiple programming languages, does that mean the interpreter for each language constructs a suitable document object before executing the scriptOr is it constructed by the browser and loaded on demand by the script  p  pem the questions apply to equivalents of the given code for each programming language implementing the DOMem pli liWhen is the document object constructed On demand or by default once the script runsli liWhat about the browsers DOM Objects like Navigator or Window do the same answers of questions 1 and 2 apply to them tooli ol

But since the captions may not be unique, it is desirable to also produce labels of the ancestor members, because together they do identify the member uniquely. p  pIn my example, I could use the parts of the member unique name to do this, but in ic cube not,since the member u name is structured differently.p  pI have 2 questionsp  p1 How can I tell beforehand what format the XMLA provider will use to identify the membersp  p2 What would be the recommended way in ic cube to produce the labels for the ancestor members p  pUPDATEp  pLuc Boudreau informed me that the ampersand indicates key notation  it designates the member key rather than its name.

Negative 2054 pI am currently facing a really weird issue. I simply want to remove all controls from a group box, but it just does not remove all controls. It really seems like a bug on Microsofts end right now. I tried many different techniques of removing these controls, but none of them worked.

Negative 2054 pThis is a very basic question which I am unable to find a satisfiable answer yet.p  pIf I have two classes codeTestCar.javacode codeCar.javacode in my directory, when I execute a codejavac TestCar.javacode the program successfully compiles and it results in creating two .class files for each class.p  pI only asked the compiler to compile codeTestCar.javacode , but somehow the compiler figured out that it needs to compile the codeCar.javacode file as well. If that is how it works I should be able to ask codejavaccode to compile only the main class of my program and it should be able to compile all the .java files the program depends on. If thats true, why do we need to issue commands like codejavac .javacode or codejavac dir1.java dir2javacode and so on p  pEven when using packages we should be able to compile all the files by executingp  precodejavac comprojectMainClass.java  codepre  pand the compiler should be able to compile all the files the program depends on.

Negative 2054 pI want to be able to take a video and extract segments that, when looped, appear continuous for the purposes of creating animated GIFs en masse.p  pStep one would obviously be extracting each frame of the video as an image.  My current idea is to take the difference of every frame and its following N frames and look for a very small difference.  That is to say, simply search for segments where the last frame closely resembles the first frame.p  pDoes this seem like a viable way to accomplish this task  If not, what would be a better way  If so, how would I accomplish taking the difference of imagesp
Negative 2054 pIm pretty new to Android and Im really struggling trying to understand what is going on in my application.  Im trying to build a small game in which a circle appears on the screen, in a random position and it disappears as soon as the user clicks on it.

Negative 2054 pI am having an issue with Cocos2dx 2.2.6 on Android 5. After playing my game for a little while it starts to severely lag. This does not happen with Android 4. After doing some research many people have said it is a problem with Android 5 working with Cocos2dxs Audio engine. Unfortunately I have not come up with a solution for this. I am sure this is the problem because if I take sounds and music out of my game on Android 5 then there is no lag at all. Some people have said to take the sound engine files from Cocos2dx 3 but I am not sure how to set that up. I believe this is a serious problem then many cocos2dx 2.2.6 users are having so I feel someone has come up with some sort of solution. Any help would be highly appreciated.

Negative 2054 pIm trying to get a list of top performing Facebook posts that belong to a page using the JavaScript Insights API. However, I cant seem to find a way to do this with just one API call.

Negative 2054 pIm trying to do a compute pass where I render to a texture that will be used in a draw pass later on. My initial implementation was based on shader storage buffer objects and was working nicely.

Negative 2054 pSo recently I started looking more seriously into classes and OOP in general in PHP. Im trying to create a simple site while taking advantage of classes as much as possible but there have been some questions that have been stuck in my mind.p  pMore specifically Id like to know how would a proper site structure look like with classes and methods that deal with users, pages, menus, etc. Currently Im using a hrefhttpsgithub.comjoshcamPHPMySQLiDatabaseClass relnofollowthis wrappera to get around MySQLi more effectively and I cant seem to decide how should I implement this wrapper with other objects  do I create a new class for users, menus, etc separately and just pass the database variable through the class every time I create an instancep  precodedb  new Mysqlidb DBSERVER, DBUSERNAME, DBPASSWORD, DBNAME user  new User db codepre  pOr do I just extend the SQL class as models like the wrappers author has pointed out a hrefhttpsgithub.comjoshcamPHPMySQLiDatabaseClassblobmastertestsmodelsuser.php relnofollowherea. p  pAlso in general, what should remain a class, what should I handle with only functions How should I handle things with my MySQL classp  pIs it a good practice to handle every single menu itemuserpage as an objectp  pThese are just some of the things confusing my mind right now. There are quite a few examples on the web about OOP but I still havent found a decent one to explain the questions I asked above.

Negative 2054 pI have an existing code which does some set task. This is how the flow goes.p  ol liThere is an entry point which gets a request object which is of some interface type.li liBased on the request type we decide whether it is a create ordermodify order operationli liNext for each operation we have steps like Validate inputConvert inputcreate request type for server and finally execute the operation.li ol  pThe same applies for all the operations. Few catch here is that each workflow requires different arguments based on the previously executed step. For eg. validate requires just the request initially passed whereas Convert requires request along with some additional parameter which the validate workflow will return. Similarly CreateRequest will need the actual request plus some additional arguments that convert workflow returned. p  pFinally we need an option to run some of the workflows asynchoronously if required This we can configure initially. p  pWhat kind of a pattern can we use for this kind of a scenario Any sample diagram or code will help. p  pThanks Jithup

Negative 2054 pIm new to JavaScript, focusing primarily on JavaPHP development. The JS applications Ive built in the past have been pretty hackish, untestable, and unextensible. p  pIm now trying to create an application that interfaces with data in a more appropriate manner. Basically Im building a user interface for creating rulesactions that our support team and end users can access. The logic for the application contains a lot of Boolean and logical operators and just requires that some arbitrary set of conditions be met, and then will apply certain actions.p  pSo, Ive pretty much settled on a query builder type of application, and I love a hrefhttpsgithub.commistic100jQueryQueryBuilder relnofollowMistics worka. Unfortunately, we dont have a Node.js server. So, Ive set about finding ways to make this work with vanilla JSjQuery. One iteration used Knockout.js. However, I found that API to be difficult to work with. p  pNow, I found this a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netgraphitekomap9gxo4L relnofollowJSFiddlea, which uses Mistics work in a standalone version. Id prefer to use this, but one thing I cant quite piece together is how to create multiple Query Builders dynamically. Rules will appear in a table as shown in the second link, and Ill need an Add Row button. p  precodebuilder.queryBuilder  sortable true,  filters [     id coreID, codepre  pIve tried using the jQuery code.eachcode function to create query builders bound to each element with a class of builder, but to no avail. p  precode.each.builder.queryBuilder codepre  pCan you guys show me how youd go about dynamically creating new QueryBuilder objects as shown in the third link p
Negative 2054 pWhile the main principle of polymorphism is decoupling what from who in term of codetypescode, but what confuses me how does methodcall mechanism finds out and calls the correct method body in polymorphism.p  pSince in java all method binding is codelatebindingcode unless the method is codestaticcode, codefinalcode or codeprivatecode, and latebinding is done by JVM which precomputes codemethod tablecode for each class and then do a table look up during runtime in normal method call.p  pBut the same thing happens during polymorphism too.
