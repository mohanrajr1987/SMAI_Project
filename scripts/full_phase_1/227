Are there already opensource implementations p  pIt seems that youd need a scoring function for a given board constellation, and a very fast way of exploring several likely future board constellations. Exploring all possible future moves is of course impossible, so one could greedily follow the most promising moves, or use approximate techniques like a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiSimulated5Fannealingsimulated annealinga to follow likely moves probabilistically.p  pDo you think that is within the scope of a a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiMachine5Flearningmachine learninga graduate student project  assuming there was an opensource implementation that the students could use, that does the basic things like returning the next possible moves for a given figure Probably too hard p  pIt would be a fun project to have different teams work on chess engines and then let them play against each other ... p

In programming, we know that objects hold references to other objects, and once those references are lost, garbage collection will come and delete those orphaned objects that no longer have any references pointing to them. In the example I provided, codePersoncode has a reference to codeAddresscode, and once the reference to codeAddresscode is lost, it will get garbage collected, assuming no other codePersonscode have a reference to it as well.p  pOn the database side, there is no concept of garbage collection. To the database, there is only onetomany or manytomany relationships, or in other words, a parent with a collection of children. Going back to codePersoncode and codeAddresscode, we see that this is a onetomany relationship from codeAddresscode to codePersoncode each person can only have one address, but an address can belong to many people, such as a household of people that share a common address. The database considers the codeAddresscode the parent and the codePersoncode as a collection of children. Thus, it makes sense that by deleting a codePersoncode, the codeAddresscode should not be deleted as well put another way, if you have a bookshelf with a collection of books, deleting a book should not delete the bookshelf.p  pSo how do we fix this Well have to delete any parents where their child collections are empty. In this case, an codeAddresscode with an empty collection of codePersonscode should be deleted. This is a business rule, as nothing states that an codeAddresscode cannot exist by itself, but in the application Im developing, an codeAddresscode by itself means nothing if its not attached to a person, and thus should be eliminated. However, its entirely possible for the address to remain in an orphaned state until some other codePersoncode comes along and references it.p

Negative 227 pI finished converting my app to use the CoreData layer for a small datawarehouse I want to use. I have some concerns about the performance and how to best use it. In particular I have a lot of runs where I read from disk attributes within files each attribute should generate a new object, unless an object of that type and that value already exists. So, for each file I read, I execute a fetch to check if that managed object already exists if yes finish, otherwise I create the object, assign value and save context.p  pCurrently, I save the context once for each time I create a new object, so it happens more or less ten times for the ten attributes for each file read which can be hundreds. Would be better to reduce the context saving points, maybe once for file instead of once for attribute I do not know the overhead of this operation so I dont know if is ok to do this so often, or how to find out the time spent on this maybe with the instruments Dont really know how.p

Negative 227 pIm having what I think is a weird problem. I have one div, inside a parent div, and Im giving the child div a width of 100, but its not growing to the size of the parent div.p  pThe parent div does strongnotstrong have a set width of any kind. So my question does width in percentage only work when a parent element has a set width, or should it grow anywayp  pCLARIFICATIONp  pSome may be wondering how the parent div has a width to grow to at all, if it itself does not have a set width. The reason is I have other siblings of the child element inside the parent div, with a set width to them, so the parent div has grown to meet those sibling widths.p  pCODE SAMPLEp  precodeltdiv idparentdivgt     ltdiv idchildelement stylewidth 100gtContentltdivgt     ltdiv idsibling stylewidth 250pxgtltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pChild element is not growing to meet the parent div. The width of 100 is essentially not doing anything at all that I can tell. This is in IE7.p  pThanks.p  pstrongFOLLOWUPstrong Thanks everyone for the answers. Im busy testing on my end. I originally thought that parent divs only grow as wide as their children, but it turns out I was wrong given my example above, which I coded only to demonstrate my issue Im having. In my case, my parent div has a codeposition fixedcode and codebottom 1pxcode and coderight 1pxcode applied to it. From my tests, this appears to change the behavior of the parent div. No longer does it automatically stretch to the entire width of the page, but assumes the behavior I thought was the case anyway, which is the parent div expands only enough to accommodate its widest child. So thats the behavior Im seeing now, but only because my parent div has a fixed position.p

Negative 227 pIm creating a database with Access. This is just a test database, similar to my requirements, so I can get my skills up before creating one for work. Ive created a database for a fictional school as this is a good playground and rich data many students have many subjects have many teachers, etc.p  pQuestion 1 What is the difference, if any, between using a Lookup column and a manytomany associate table  Example I have Tables Teacher and Subject. Many teachers have many subjects. I can, and have, created a table TeacherSubject and run queries with this.  I have then created a lookup column in teachers table with data from subjects. The lookup column seems to take the place of the teachersubject table. though the data on relationships is obviously duplicated between lookup table and teachersubject and may vary. Which one is the better option Is there a snag with using lookup tables I realize that this is a very general question. Links to other resources and answers saying that depends... are appreciatedp  pQuestion 2 What attracts me to lookup tables is the following When creating a form for entering subjects for teachers, with lookup I can simply create checkboxes and click a subject for a teacher on or off. Each click onoff createsremoves a record in the lookup column which replaces teachersubject.  If I use a form from a query from teacher subject with teacher as main form and subject as subform I run into this problem In the subform I can either select each subject that teacher has in a bombo box, i.e. click, scroll down, select, go to next row, click, scroll down, etc. takes too long OR I can create a list box listing all available subjects in each row but allowing me to select only one. takes up too much space. Is it possible to have a click onoff list box for teachersubject, creatingremoving a record there with each clickp  pNote  I know zero SQL or VB. If the correct answer is you need to know SQL for this then thats cool. I just need to know.p  pThanksp

Now, I figured there emmustem something wrong with the token verification  but when I hardwire in another test to echo the value of fail after the test, its still false  The conditional is never entered I also just put a straight codediecode instead of codefail  truecode  and I still get a codevideomp4code header.p  pI simply cannot believe that commenting out code that never gets executed could cause a distinct response  and furthermore, that it emwouldem play in Chrome, but not in Safari whatevers happening serverside with PHP should be completely transparent to the browser.p  pCrazy.p  pstrongAHAstrongp  pI added some logging to my script, and it turns out that when serving HTML5 video, the browser makes emtwoem requests.p  pHeres the two successful requests from Chromep  precodeFri Jun 25 174122 2010 Browser [Mozilla5.0 Macintosh U Intel Mac OS X 1064 enUS AppleWebKit533.4 KHTML, like Gecko Chrome5.0.375.86 Safari533.4] Fail [0] Token [83e50b519c0ed4662b6b7fabb8f6671e] Timestamp [1277509282] Fri Jun 25 174122 2010 Verification passed  Fri Jun 25 174122 2010 Browser [Mozilla5.0 Macintosh U Intel Mac OS X 1064 enUS AppleWebKit533.4 KHTML, like Gecko Chrome5.0.375.86 Safari533.4] Fail [0] Token [83e50b519c0ed4662b6b7fabb8f6671e] Timestamp [1277509282] Fri Jun 25 174122 2010 Verification passed codepre  pAnd heres the two from Safari first successful, 2nd failsp  precodeFri Jun 25 174132 2010 Browser [Apple Mac OS X v10.6.4 CoreMedia v1.0.0.10F569] Fail [0] Token [6374fba3d9eac7d94de9741db76953c6] Timestamp [1277509291] Fri Jun 25 174132 2010 Verification passed  Fri Jun 25 174133 2010 Browser [QuickTime7.6.6 qtver7.6.6cpuIA32osMac 10.6.4] Fail [1] Token [] Timestamp [1277509291] codepre  pI have to go out right now, but Im almost certain this behavior is the root of the bug.

Negative 227 pIm attempting to make an autoindenting textarea and so far it works with the following code. The problem that Im having is that Im currently preventing the default action of pressing enter in order to calculate the tabs in the line, and then inserting the newline afterwards.p  pThis works, but I want to have the default action of the textarea, in that if you hold enter down, it doesnt scroll the textarea until the caret hits the bottom row, and then the scroll bar stays with caret at the bottom row. The current code below keeps the caret in field of vision if used anywhere in the textarea, but it causes content above the caret to scroll up, which is a compromise as the caret no longer disappears. If there is no other solution this will work fine, but Im hoping there are other ideas.p  precode    var start  this.selectionStart1     var end  this.selectionEnd     var sT  this.scrollTop     var sH  this.scrollHeight     var vH  this.height      var x  sH  sT  vH       Check if hitting enter on the first line as no newline will be found     if this.value.lastIndexOfn,start1      var startSubstr  0     else       var startSubstr  this.value.lastIndexOfn,start1      var endFirst  end  startSubstr      var valueToScan  this.value.substrstartSubstr,endFirst     var count  0       Count only t at the beginning of the line, none in the code        while valueToScan.indexOft1       if valueToScan.indexOft0       break      count      valueToScan  valueToScan.substrvalueToScan.indexOft1            Command to isert the newline, and then add the ts found in previously       this.insertAtCaretn     for var i0iltcountcount       this.insertAtCarett             var sH  this.scrollHeight     this.scrollTop  sH  x  vH codepre  pstrongEDITstrong  As an update, to clear away any confusion, Im attempting to create an IDE style textbox, so for example in most IDEs if you type the followingp  precodefunction examplewhatever       Example Stuff  And then hit enter here codepre  pI want it to take you to the same tab distance from the left border as Example Stuff in order to keep your code easier to read. I currently have that functionality but the problem is that I am intercepting the enter key, which means I have to then provide that functionality. Im having difficulty replicating the exact functionality of not scrolling the textbox until the cursor hits the bottom border. So, if you were to hold enter at the top of the textarea, the cursor just scrolls down the textarea, moving any text with it until it hits the bottom border, and then the scrollbar for the textarea will follow the cursor. Make sensep  pstrongEDIT 2strong emUpdated tags to indicate code is with PHPemp  pIve been working on this while this post has been sitting. I think another option that Im going to explore when I get a chance is rather than preventing enter just allow the default action of hitting enter and read the string from codelastIndexOfn1code to the most recent codencodefor any codetcode. I think that would give me the string Im looking for, but without messing up the behavior of the textarea. Will update again after testing.p  pstrongEDIT 3strong Resolved, as per my previous update I decided to scan the string after the key is pressed, preserving the natural behavior section changed added below for those interested and the only problem that really remains is that if you hold enter, it wont count the indentation from the origin of the enter press, which is fine by me. Im going to give this one to matyr, although I did figure out before he responded he was still the closest.p  precodeif this.value.lastIndexOfn,start21   var startSubstr  0  else   var startSubstr  this.value.lastIndexOfn,start11      var valueToScan  this.value.substrstartSubstr,start codepre

Negative 227 pOk, Ive spent two days on this and am losing confidence in both myself and the Entity Framework.  I posted a question similar to this yesterday, but since I did not phrase it right, I was unable to get my issue resolved completely.  Here it goes again.p  pFirst of all, I am writing a Silverlight application using RIA Services with the Entity Framework.  In my database I have two very simple tables  HeaderTable and DetailsTable.  The relationship between the two is a 1 to many.  The EDM generated properties to navigate back and forth between these two entities.  For example, in HeaderTable, I have a property called DetailTables that is a collection of all the DetailTalbe entities for the current HeaderTable entity. p  pKeeping it simple, from the client I want to return ALL of the HeaderTable entities.  I do it like thisp  precodepublic void TestFromClient    if context  null                context  new TestContext     EntityQueryltHeaderTablegt query  context.GetHeaderTablesQuery     context.LoadltHeaderTablegtquery    codepre  pWithin my callback method I do in fact get a collection to all the HeaderTable items.  However, the property DetialTables which should hold all of my detail records is empty.  Since these entities are related, I figured I would get them during the query.  So, once I found I was not getting these entities, I made changes to my GetHeaderTables on the server as followsp  precodepublic IQueryableltHeaderTablegt GetHeaderTables    return this.ObjectContext.HeaderTable   Original   return this.ObjectContext.HeaderTable.IncludeDetailTables  codepre  pThis should now be explicitly bringing back my details within my headers, but just like my first attempt, by the time it gets to the client, the DetailTalbles property within my HeaderTable property is empty. Just as a test, I decided to see what was going on within the server function GetHeaderTables and did this so I could debug the valuep  precodepublic IQueryableltHeaderTablegt GetHeaderTables    return this.ObjectContext.HeaderTable   Original   return this.ObjectContext.HeaderTable.IncludeDetailTables   ListltHeaderTablegt test  this.ObjectContext.HeaderTable.IncludeDetailTables.ToList  codepre  pSure enough, all of my HeaderTable entities had a valid DetailTables property with a collection of all the details.  So, it is working on the server, but it is not working on the client.  I am clearly missing something, but I cant figure out what. If anyone can see what I am doing wrong or have advice for going at this a different way, Im all ears.p  pAs a side note, I also cant figure out why I am not able to specify the Include on the client side context.

Negative 227 pWe have an old Win32 and new WPF version of our blotter software, which the traders are currently running side by side. However, running the WPF application often severly slows down the redraw rate of the Win32 application.p  pWithout the WPF application running or minimized, draw rate is fluid and fast in the Win32 application. With the WPF application open alongside it, the Win32 appls UI draw rate slows down noticeably. Running the WPF application seems to trigger use of some resources which are taken away from the Win32 app both graphicsheavy  causing the slow down it seems.p  pCPU and Memory are not anywhere near being saturated, so it doesnt seem to be related to those. Lowering resolution andor reducing the number of monitors to display on therefore decreasing video card memory usage and bandwidth load makes no noticeable difference, therefore it doesnt seem to be a graphics hardware performance issue either.p  pOne hypothesis that may explain the cause is as followsp  pUnder the hood, we know that both the WPF and Win32 applications output graphics information to a windows message pump which is basically a queue of instructions of what to draw to the screen. It seems as if when the WPF application is not running, the Win32 has full unfettered access to this and screen updates are fluid. Running the WPF application alongside it puts additional messages on this queue, so Win32 application has to compete harder for access to it in order to do each screen element update, therefore clogging the pump giving the effect we see.p  pIf the above is the case, can anyone recommend approaches to managecontrol the window message pump in order to prevent this happeningp  pThe flicker is the type you typically get when resources run low, where you can see individual elements forms, labels flicker and gradually draw on to the screen.p  pIf anyone has any suggestionsideas, let us know.p

To compile a program, you need a compiler, which is also a type of program, so what compiled the compiler Somebody told me that the first compilers were written in assembly or machine code. But thinking about that, that is still not the complete story. After all, how does the machine code go from the hard drive to RAM to the CPU without an operating system and drivers The drivers had to have been programmed somehow.p  pI know that the very early computers had switches and allowed you to flip the switch to indicate bits. I am wondering how the leap was made from switches to a way to get the CPU to read machine code without needing a computer program to tell it to do so.p

Also not a problem. Its conceivable that theres a slight window where the target job could get started before this code can start it, but after checking if its started. However, I can just wrap that up in a try catch and just ignore the error, rightp  precodebegin try if dbo.WQIsQueueJobActiveindex  0 begin     exec msdb.dbo.spstartjob JobName     break end          end try begin catch      nothing here end catch codepre  pheres the problem, though.p  p9 times out of 10, this works just fine. SQL agent will raise the error, its caught, and processing just continues on, since the job is already running, no harm no foul. p  pBut occasionally, Ill get a message in the Job History view keep in mind the above code to detect if a specific job is running and start it if not is actually running from another job saying that the job failed because SQLAgent has refused to start the job because it already has a pending request.p  pOf course, this is the exact error that TRY CATCH is supposed to be handlingp  pWhen this happens, the executing job just dies, but not immediately from what I can tell, just pretty close. Ive put logging all over the place and theres no consistency. One time it fails, itll be at place a, the next time at place b. In some cases, Place A and place B have nothing but a p  precodeselect var  message codepre  pin between them. Very strange. Basically, the job appears to be unceremoniously dumped and anything left to execute in the job is not executed at all.p  pHowever, if I remove the exec StartJob or have it invoked exactly one time, when I KNOW that the target job cant already be running, everything works perfectly and all my processing in the job runs through.p  pThe purpose behind all this is to have a job started as a result of a trigger among other things, and, if the job is already started, theres really no need to start it again.p  pAnyone ever run into behavior like this with SQL Agents Job handlingp  pEDIT Current flow of control is like sop  ol liChange to a table update or insert...li lifires trigger which calls...li lia stored proc which calls...li lispStartJob which...li listarts a specific job which...li licalls another stored proc called CheckQueue which...li liperforms some processing and...li lichecks several tables and depending on their contents might...li liinvoke spstartjob on another job to start up a second, simultaneous job to process the additional work this second job calls the CheckQueue sproc also but the two invocations operate on completely separate sets of datali ol

While this is being done another process might come along and try to save new content.

Negative 227 pI need help in enhancing a thread scheduling strategy I am working on.p  h1Backgroundh1  pTo set the context, I have a couple 2030 thousand tasks that needs to be executed. Each task can execute independently. In reality, the range of execution time varies between 40ms and 5mins across tasks. Also, each individual task when rerun takes the same amount of time.p  pI need options to control the way these tasks are executed, so I have come up with a scheduling engine that schedules these tasks based on various strategies. The most basic strategy is FCFS, i.e. my tasks get executed sequentially, one by one. The second one is a  batch strategy, the scheduler has a bucket size b which controls how many threads can run in parallel. The scheduler will kick off nonblocking threads for the frist b tasks it gets, then waits for those started tasks to complete, then proceed with the next b tasks, starting them in parallel and then waiting for completion. Each b set of tasks processed at a time is termed a batch and hence batch scheduling.p  pNow, with batch scheduling, activity begins to increase at the beginning of the batch, when threads start getting created, then peaks in the middle, when most of the threads would be running, and then wanes down as we block and wait for the threads to join back in. Batch scheduling becomes FCFS scheduling when batch size b  1.p  pOne way to improve on batch scheduling is what I will term as parallel scheduling  the scheduler will ensure, if sufficient number of tasks are present, that b number of threads will keep running at any point in time. The number of threads initially will ramp up to b, then maintain the count at b running threads, until the last set of tasks finish execution. To maintain execution of b threads at any time, we need to start a new thread the moment an old thread finishes execution. This approach can reduce the amount of time taken to finish processing all the tasks compared to batch scheduling average case scenario.p  h1Part where I need helph1  pThe logic I have to implement parallel scheduling follows. I would be obliged if anyone can help me onp  ul liCan we avoid the use of the startedTasks list I am using that because I need to be sure that when the Commit exits, all tasks have completed execution, so I just loop through all startedTasks and block until they are complete. One current problem is that list will be long.li ul  pOR p  ul liIs there a better way to do parallel schedulingli ul  pAny other suggestionsstrategies are also welcome  main goal here is to shorten overall execution duration within the constraints of the batch size bp  h2ParallelScheduler pseudocodeh2  precode assume all variable accessupdates are thread safe Semaphore S with an initial capacity of b QueueltTaskgt tasks ListltTaskgt startedTasks bool allTasksCompleted  false   The following method is called by a callee  that wishes to start tasks, it can be called any number of times  passing various task items METHOD void ScheduleTask Task t       if the PollerThread not started yet then start it       starting PollerThead will call PollerThreadAction        set up the task so that when it is completed, it releases 1      on semaphore S      assume OnCompleted is executed when the task t completes      execution after a call to t.Start     t.OnCompleted gt S.Release1      tasks.Enqueue  t     This method is called when the callee  wishes to notify that no more tasks are present that needs  a ScheduleTask call.

Negative 227 pIn heavy loops, such as ones found in game applications, there could be many factors that decide what part of the loop body is executed for example, a character object will be updated differently depending on its current state and so instead of doingp  precodevoid myloopfunctionint dt    if conditionX ampamp conditionY      doFoo   else     doBar    ...  codepre  pI am used to using a function pointer that points to a certain logic function corresponding to the characters current emstateem, as inp  precodevoid updaterint  void somethinghappens    updater  ampdoFoo  void somethingelsehappens    updater  ampdoBar  void myloopfunctionint dt    updaterdt    ...  codepre  pAnd in the case where I dont want to do anything, I define a dummy function and point to it when I need top  precodevoid donothingint dt   codepre  pNow what Im really wondering is am I obsessing about this needlessly The example given above of course is simple sometimes I need to check many variables to figure out which pieces of code Ill need to execute, and so I figured out using these state function pointers would indeed be more optimal, and to me, natural, but a few people Im dealing with are heavily disagreeing.p  pSo, is the gain from using a virtualfunction pointer worth it instead of filling my loops with conditional statements to flow the logicp  pstrongEditstrong to clarify how the pointer is being set, its done through event handling on a perobject basis. When an event occurs and, say, that character has custom logic attached to it, it sets the updater pointer in that event handler until another event occurs which will change the flow once again.p  pThank youp
Negative 227 pI fell in love with codeCustomTablecode to build datadriven WiX installs.  I had a custom action that I needed to execute on a dozen or so objects during an installation.  Instead of having 12 codeltCustom Actioncode... entries in the codeInstallExecutecode sequence, I put all the appropriate stuff into a CustomTable and process via a loop inside a single CustomAction.p  pNow I want to leverage the functionality that WiX provides, such as codeXmlFilecode in conjunction with CustomTables.  For example, I have a bunch of .configxml files to process during the install instead of having a million codeltXmlFilecode... elements in the Wix source I would like to add rows to the codeXmlFilecode table directly.  Similar situation for configuring IIS where there are many WebApplication and WebVirtualDirs that I need to configure.p  pIt looks like this can be done by inserting temporary rows into the appropriate table ie codeXmlFilecode or codeIIsWebVirtualDircode.  But I cant seem to find any examples of how to do this with DTF or otherwise.  p  pBob Arnson alluded to the fact that this is possible in an old post on a hrefhttpwww.joyofsetup.com20070701semicustomactions relnofollow titlesection Extra Creditjoyofsetupa that I came upon, unfortunately I cant find any other references to how to implement.p

Negative 227 h3The Scenarioh3  pI have a need to represent an object in two different contexts. One context should not persist and the other should. The persistent objects are actual data pulled from another system. The nonpersistent objects represent parts of a product definition. The two will be compared, and Im not interested in storing the definition data. The persisting object needs to have additional information stored with it. p  h3The Implementationh3  pIn order to accomplish this, I decided that the most logical thing to do would be to create the base class in the srcgroovy folder to avoid grailshibernate wanting to persist it as a domain class. p  precodeclass Resource     String name     Date lastModified   codepre  pThe domain class that I want to persist looks like the following.p  precodeclass OwnedResource extends Resource     Date dateCreated, lastUpdated   Owner owner   static belongsTo  [owner Owner]   static mapping      I assumed I would need this so that grails would not expect     to store the object in the base class table that doesnt exist    tablePerHierarchy true     table ownedresource     codepre  pLastly we then have the Owner class which hasMany OwnedResources.p  precodeclass Owner   Date dateCreated, lastUpdated   String name   static hasMany  [     resources OwnedResource   ]  codepre  h3The Problemh3  pWhen I runapp, I end up getting a friendly Hibernate exceptionp  precode20111024 203201,307 [main] ERROR context.GrailsContextLoader   Error executing bootstraps  Error creating bean with name messageSource Initialization of bean failed nested exception  is org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanCreationException Error creating bean with name  transactionManager Cannot resolve reference to bean sessionFactory while setting bean  property sessionFactory nested exception is  org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanCreationException Error creating bean with name  sessionFactory Invocation of init method failed nested exception is  org.hibernate.MappingException Association references unmapped class OwnedResource  org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanCreationException Error creating bean with name  messageSource Initialization of bean failed nested exception is  org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanCreationException Error creating bean with name  transactionManager Cannot resolve reference to bean sessionFactory while setting bean  property sessionFactory nested exception is  org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanCreationException Error creating bean with name  sessionFactory Invocation of init method failed nested exception is  org.hibernate.MappingException Association references unmapped class OwnedResource at org.grails.tomcat.TomcatServer.startTomcatServer.groovy212 at grails.web.container.EmbeddableServerstart.callUnknown Source at GrailsRungroovyrunclosure5closure12.doCallGrailsRungroovy158 at GrailsRungroovyrunclosure5closure12.doCallGrailsRungroovy at GrailsSettingsgroovyrunclosure10.doCallGrailsSettingsgroovy280 at GrailsSettingsgroovyrunclosure10.callGrailsSettingsgroovy at GrailsRungroovyrunclosure5.doCallGrailsRungroovy149 at GrailsRungroovyrunclosure5.callGrailsRungroovy at GrailsRungroovy.runInlineGrailsRungroovy116 at GrailsRungroovy.this4runInlineGrailsRungroovy at GrailsRungroovyrunclosure1.doCallGrailsRungroovy59 at RunApprunclosure1.doCallRunApp.groovy33 at gant.Gantdispatchclosure5.doCallGant.groovy381 at gant.Gantdispatchclosure7.doCallGant.groovy415 at gant.Gantdispatchclosure7.doCallGant.groovy at gant.Gant.withBuildListenersGant.groovy427 at gant.Gant.this2withBuildListenersGant.groovy at gant.Gantthis2withBuildListeners.callCurrentUnknown Source at gant.Gant.dispatchGant.groovy415 at gant.Gant.this2dispatchGant.groovy at gant.Gant.invokeMethodGant.groovy at gant.Gant.executeTargetsGant.groovy590 at gant.Gant.executeTargetsGant.groovy589 at com.intellij.rt.execution.application.AppMain.mainAppMain.java120  Caused by org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanCreationException Error creating bean with name transactionManager Cannot resolve reference to bean sessionFactory while setting bean property sessionFactory nested exception is org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanCreationException Error creating bean with name sessionFactory Invocation of init method failed nested exception is org.hibernate.MappingException Association references unmapped class OwnedResource ... 24 more  Caused by org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanCreationException Error creating bean with name sessionFactory Invocation of init method failed nested exception is org.hibernate.MappingException Association references unmapped class OwnedResource ... 24 more  Caused by org.hibernate.MappingException Association references unmapped class OwnedResource ... 24 more codepre  pPerhaps my implementation is bad practice, since after much googling and searching of StackOverflow, I have yet to encounter anyone facing this same issue or attempting a similar implementation.

Or may even be a popup, so Badguy writes the letter in HTML format and adds some positionfixed or positionabsolute styles, so one of the blocks for this example let it be email information  login and password popup, saying user session has ended, to renew, enter your data with design like the goodmail.ex service has. The user thinks its okay and not related so he inputs it and this information gets send somewhere else.p  pSo The question is not how I can block this css, some filtering with a custom parser should work well here, but how can I block user to use any of the CSS classes that goodmail.ex is using For example goodmail.ex is filtering every letter for positionfixed, but has some block floating with a class named goodmailfloatingbox, so the Badguy simply writes  and the fakelogin gets the positionfixed attribute. This is something not really well explained, but I hope you will understand what is required.p  pOh yes, iframe is not an option.p  pSo is it possible to override existing defined class styles with some code in the middle of the page to make it safe AND make it as much crossbrowser compatible as it canp  pThank youp

Negative 227 pI am wanting to use a JTable but with a different cell selection method rather than clicking in the cells.  I am using the glasspane to allow users to draw a rectangle and am discovering what cells are contained in the rectangle to select.  But I am only wanting to select a cell if it is totally within the rectangle.  For example, imagine a simple 3 x 3 table.  The user my want to select the middle cell 1,1.  I want them to be able to click in the first cell 0,0 and drag down to cell 2,2 drawing the rectangle for selection.  But I dont want cells 0,0 or 2,2 selected.  Or get all 9 selected, for that matter.  This is a simplified example.  Drawing the rectangle might actually encompass cells from more than one table on the screen.p  pI looked into implementing the ListSelectionModel interface, but dont really want to try and rewrite that.  While experimenting I saw that setSelectionInterval in the model was being called like crazy for every single mouse movement as I click and dragged around in the table.  What I would really like is to find a simple way to turn off whatever listenermechanism is on the table that makes the calls to the SelectionModel, while keeping the model in place.

Negative 227 pI have an interesting case to solvep  pI have a native winapi application, which uses MDI. This application allows me to extend itself with a simple scripting language. The scripts are launched on different thread than UI thread although I can get the UI thread ID with appropriate functions. The scripting language also allow me to launch any c code through LoadLibrary. p  pWhat I would like to achieve is to create a new window inside this application, which could host WPF and attach it as a MDI child window to MDI client mdi area. Also, I would like this window to properly talk to MDI area, for example update list of windows in mdi menu.p  pSo far, my first guess was to just create a WinForms window, host WPF inside, and then try to make it mdi child window by setting MDI client as its parent because my hosting application is not written in c, I only have a handle, so I did this with codeUser32.SetParentcode PInvoke. This worked almost well, after I attached my script thread to GUI thread, but I had few problems with it the MDI menu with active windows did not update, the window did not interact correctly it stayed on stop when it shouldnt etc.. p  pThen, I tried to set flags style, exStyles with codeSetWindowLongPtrcode. It changed my windows behavior a bit, but that was still not it.p  pNow Im considering using codeCreateMDIWindowcode function, or doing it by codeSendMessagecode, according to docs sending message should create a window, even if I send it from different thread. The problem is, that this way would give me a native handle only, and I could not find yet any way of hosting WinForms  WPF inside it. p  pIm curious if anyone tried to do something similar and had any results with it Which way would be the best  trying to create a WinForms window and add it to MDI client, or create a native window and try to host WinForms in it any particular way of doing that p  pMost answers for this question I have found are dealing with situation where hosting application is managed, so you can just set code.MDIParentcode property, which wont work in this case Im afraid.p

Negative 227 pheres the situationp  pI have javascript which creates a table layout for a textarea. This is part of a list which users can dynamically add and delete textareas.

The only way its broken in IE is none of the textareas that are generated send their POST data.p  pThis used to be written in pure javascript, but I recently learned that utilizing a library like jQuery is preferable since that puts some of the burden of maintenance on the jQuery team as new browsers are developed. p  pHere is the javascript and the html it outputsp  pJavascriptp  precodevar currentstep  1       STEP ID NAME CONSTANTS  var stepcontainerid  stepcontainer var steptitlecontainerid  titlecontainer var steptitleid  steptitle var steptextcontaineridtextcontainer var steptextdata  textdata  var removestepid  removestep  var addstepid  addstep    Well use a doubly linked list to navigate the instruction structure.   var LISTHEAD  null  var LISTTAIL  null    ...

Negative 227 pi am new to sockets and i am learningreading some epoll materials and codes. My questions is that could epoll totally replace selectpoll when epoll is available in systemLinux p  pi think socket programming also should have some paradigms to follow in practice. When i was reading codes, i find some select with epollp  ol lipa server code use select when it deals with blocking socket. I think epollLT behaves just the same as select so it is ok to use epoll to replace all select.pli lipsome legacy code use epoll to monitor. After events returns, select is used on corresponding fd to check it just before readwrite. i am not quite sure the meaning of this select.pli ol  pi am confused about these select code and hope someone can help.p

Negative 227 pWe are using a set of Excel files on several machines in our company. These files contain a VBA application which utilizes a couple of ActiveX control objects from codemscomct2.ocxcode library namely, codeMonthViewcode and codeDateTimePickercode. ActiveX objects are to be displayed in UserForm. Unfortunately the portability of these files seems limited in a very peculiar way.p  pThere appears to be 2 groups of machinesp  ul listrongGroup Astrong I can create a Excel file containing codeMonthViewcode on such machine and work with it on any Group A PC. But when I try to open this file on any machine from Group B, Im getting a emCould not load an object because it is not available on this machineem error. However, files with the same ActiveX created on Group B machines work normaly on A machines.li listrongGroup Bstrong File with an ActiveX in question created on these machines work everywhere i.e. on any A and B machine. But, as I said earlier, B machines give the error mentioned above when the file with ActiveX saved on A machine is opened.li ul  pIn one sentence emfiles created on A machine work only on other As, files created on Bs work everywhereemp  pThe strangest thing here is that every machine has codemscomct2.ocxcode registered once again I can create the form with the codeMonthViewcode strongon any machine in questionstrong. The code.ocxcode itself is in place on each machine and the whole set of registry keys is present CLSIDs for controls classes, IIDs, typelib ID.... In addition, the data in these registry keys seem to be the same on A and B group machines GUIDs, ProgIDs, versions etc.. There are slight differences in description strings values like Microsoft MonthView Control 6.0 SP6 on some machines but this does not seem to affect the situation some machines in B group have such descriptions different but files created on them still work everywhere.p  pNaturally, thanks to Murphys law, the machine I use to edit these Excel files belongs to Group A, so files saved here are unportable to B machines...p  pThe OS and Excel versions dont seem to affect the situation. For example, one of B machines is working under Win 7 64 bit Excel 2007, while most others group A and B machines are Win XP Prof 32 bit SP3, with Excel 2003 installed. So it seems that OS and Excel versions dont affect compatibility and the problem is somehow connected with ActiveX.p  pThe only ActiveXrelated difference between A and B groups I found is the file version of codemscomct2.ocxcode at least several of A machines have version 6.1.x.x, while Group B has 6.0.x.x. I dont see how can such difference cause problems ActiveX are COM objects after all, and according to registry key values, the exposed typelib, com objects and interfaces seem to be the same in all cases. Nevertheless I tried to replace my 6.1.x.x codeocxcode with 6.0.x.x version... and ran into more trouble. What I did isp  ol licoderegsvr32 u mscomct2.ocxcode  completed successfullyli liReplaced the codemscomct2.ocxcode with file of 6.0.x.x versionli licoderegsvr32 mscomct2.ocxcode  completed successfullyli ol  pAfter these steps I tried to make an Excel file with single form containing the codeMonthViewcode. But when I tried to place a control in the form Ive got a messagebox with error emClass not registeredem. This is really strange cause everything seem to be registered the control class, its interfaces, typelib yes, Ive checked the registry to be sure. But still the error was there.p  pAfter that I did the unregisterreplaceregister procedure again to go back to my original 6.1.x.x file. That took me back to the original SNAFU situation I could again install ActiveX to user form and use it, but the Group B machines still gave the error on files saved by my machine.p  pI assume that the problem of fileswithActiveX portability and the problem of codeocxcode registration are somehow connected, but I dont see how. Perhaps there are some additional requirements for registration of an ActiveX in Excel VBA which I dont know...p  pThe only thing I need is to have the ActiveX object contaned in my Excel file compatible with other machines. Can anyone help me with thatp

Negative 227 pI am currently able to visualize correctly in ParaView a .vtp file for each time step of a simulation, and to print a screenshot for each. I want to do that in batch, but I want to keep the same state for each one view point, filters applied, etc. I have already saved the state into a .psvm file , and I tried to write a python script which, after being run by pvbatch, will hopefully print the screenshots. But, unfortunately, it is not working. I tried to change the filename in the state by processing the state file and doing a search and replace, but still it is not working. For instance, it keeps plotting the first data input only, even if the current file is different altough GetSources shows an always increasing list of sources. I use ParaView 3.14.0 in Snow Leopard.

Negative 227 pI have recently encountered a very strange issue that might be due to the kernel memory allocator.  At first, I suspected some type of memory bug in my C code but the exact behavior I am seeing leads me to believe that perhaps it is not due to a bug in the code. Its quite strange, but heres my best description of the problem.p  pI have an application that writes and overwrites files in the devshm area of my machine. At the beginning of the program, it declares file pointers for all of the files it is going to write and continuously overwrite. These pointers all created at the start of the program.p  pWhen I run the code, I notice the following.  First memory usage jumps up to 4.3 of my system total looking under top.  This happens right when I launch the executable. Then, the CPU usage hovers around 4050 before the code even starts doing anything.  After about 23 minutes of this, the memory usage then goes to 5.0 and there are no further increases.  At the time this happens, the CPU usage falls to 515 which is the range the program usually runs at due to the rate that data is being passed to it.p  pSomething is happening behind the scenes during my programs startup with the memory but I cant understand what it is, it feels like it shouldnt take 23 minutes to allocate 5 of system memory 1.2GB on a modern x8664 server. Note that after this strange startup, the program usually runs without issue.p  pHowever, today, I had to increase the number of files the program is writing to in devshm and accordingly, the number of pointers as well.  And here is where the trouble is, during the startup procedure, the CPU usage suddenly jumps to 100 and stays there.  This is a huge problem because it leads to a massive slowdown of my application, below acceptable levels.  The only difference between this and the working executable is the number of files I am having it write.  To give specifics, I increased the number of files from 1345 to 1350. In fact, just one over 1346 is sufficient to kick off this 100 cpu issue.p  pIm really at a loss about what I am dealing with here.  Im suspecting perhaps something with SLABSLUB allocator my system is Centos 5.8 with 2.6.35 kernel.  Any ideas or hints about how to resolve this will be much appreciated.p

Negative 227 pIs there anyway in Linux or more generally in a POSIX OS to guarantee that during the execution of a program, no file descriptors will be reused, even if a file is closed and another opened My understanding is that this situation would usually lead to the file descriptor for the closed file being reassigned to the newly opened file.p  pIm working on an IO tracing project and it would make life simpler if I could assume that after an openfopen call, all subsequent IO to that file descriptor is to the same file.p  pIll take either a compiletime or runtime solution.p  pIf it is not possible, I could do my own accounting when I process the trace file noting the location of all open and close calls, but Id prefer to squash the problem during execution of the traced program.p

Negative 227 pFirst of all sorry if this was already asked and sorted out. I really did a hard search and cant able to find a better solution.p  pRequirement We are developing an Android application where we need to upload the video files to a folder in the web server. The web server is running in PHP.  The video files are very huge in size more than 10 MB.  And the web server is hosted on a shared hosting server where they have PHP upload limit as 2MB.p  pI hope my requirement is very clear to understand.p  pWe struggled for several days and found apache FTP could solve our problem.  After having few sleep less nights, we able to done the upload via FTP.  The problem in FTP is if the data Internet  3G goes down then the FTP is stopped and it is not resuming after the data Internet  3G is available.p  pNow we are back to square 1.  Searching again how to upload large files from android device to PHP server.p  pI need your advice on this.  Kindly help.p  pThanks amp Regards Malaip
Negative 227 pIm trying to optimize traffic signal lights timings with genetic algorithm. Ive made an animation of traffic in html5, and GA is implemented in javascript. So, when i want to run simulation of that animation, it runs forever. p  pAnimation on every 20ms draw semaphores and cars, and updates values for next iteration. In simulation I only call update functions, because I dont need to draw semaphores and cars. p  pSo the difference between animation and simulation is in that, that simulation doesnt draw anything on canvas and it runs in while loop, while animation runs in setInterval loop. p  pAny ideas how could I speed up simulationp  pI tried to calculate travel time for each car, but its really hard because you need to include waiting times on red, in congestion etc.p

Negative 227 pI am trying to come to some sort of solution to a common problem with synching projectile firing and game networking in general, but am unsure on what would be the best fit.p  pThis is a 2D action sidescroller with several projectiles no instant hit weapons and already has much of the framework in place C XNA Framework and Lidgren library.p  pAt this time I am thinking the architecture is going to be modeled similar to the halflife source engine.  Clients will interpolate remote entities 100ms or about 3 frames in the past fixed step 30fps and using client side prediction.  Server has authority over the simulation.  Thinking about coding the implementation with movement seems fine, but when it comes to projectiles I am unsure of how it would best work to provide the best gameplay for all players.p  pbrp  h2EXAMPLE PROBLEMh2  pClient Abr Client Bbr Serverp  ol liClient A and B are just standing facing each other.li liClient B starts to fire toward A and sends input to server as usual. Server detects fire input and starts to fire weapon in its simulation while relaying the event to client A.li liClient A receives the message but is still interpolating client B in the past meanwhile the projectile is now coming toward A on the server and client Bs machine.li liClient As rendering finally gets to the point where B shot the projectile and starts rendering that.li liClient A sees it and jumps, easily clearing it on his screen.  However, the projectile hits him on the server and on client Bs point of view.li ol  pThis is also 2D sidescroller so everything is visible.p  pIt seems to be a fundamental side affect of using interpolation which I think is a must, but am open to suggestions, as even without any network latency there is inherent interpolation latency.p  pbrp  h2QUESTIONh2  pI know it cant possibly be perfect, but are there any more or better ways that I can implement to obfuscate or ameliorate this so that it emlooksem goodseamless, or am I missing anything obvious  The firing of the weapon emdoesem have a short animation time before the projectile is actually fired which I realize we can use that time to hide some of the latency, but the weapons are not instant fire, and any way I look at it there is always going to be this large gap with the client trying to dodge projectiles and other clients seeing their projectiles hitting them.p  pWe can use lag compensation on the server for cases where the players are moving, but I dont think that could help this situationp  pIf the projectile hit causes client As position to be altered I would have to rewind client A and replay his inputs with the new data, or if it doesnt, I have to remove the projectile from midair and maybe they die, ugly either way .p

Negative 227 pSo I have this dilemma, where I have a backbone view that creates a subviews that will be appended to the main view. Each of these subview have to make a ajax call that will retrieve data to complete the subview. Now the super view calls each subviews render and a appends it to itself. I then take the element of the main view and post it to a server, the problem is the ajax are finish after I sent the post to the server. Is there a better way to structure this work with asynchronous calls I have this working with synchronous but the load bar doesnt even show up. p  pSo here is example of what it is likep  precodeWebView generatefunction     var html  new MainView.render.el     ajax post to server with html   MainView      initalize     renderfunction         this.el.appendnew Subview.render.el       Subview     initialize     renderfucntion         ajax  with  a success that alters the el         return this      codepre  pNow the generate function finishes before I can even get the data back from the calls and I cant bind to anything because the data is already sent to the server.p

Negative 227 pIm making a War Game for iOS using Monotouch and C.  Im running into some problem with the audio sound effects.  p  pstrongHeres what I requirestrong  The ability to play many sound effects simultaneously possibly up to 1020 at once and the ability to adjust volume for example, if the user zooms in on the battlefield the gun shot volume gets louder.  p  pstrongHere are my problemsstrongp  pWith AVAudioPlayer, I can adjust volume but I can only play 1 sound per thread.  So if I want to play multiple sounds I have to have dozens and dozens of threads going just incase they overlap...  This is a war game, picture 20 soldiers on the battlefield.  Each soldier would have a sound thread to play gun fire sounds when they shoot because It is possible that every soldier could just happen to fire at the same exact time.  I dont have a problem with making lots of threads, but my game already has dozens of threads running all the time and adding dozens more could get me into trouble... right  So Id rather not go this road of adding dozens of more threads unless i have too...p  pWith SystemSound, I can play as many sounds as I want in the same thread, but I cant adjust the volume.... So my work around here is, for every sound effect i have  save it like 4 times at 4 different volumes.  That is a big pain... Any way to adjust volume with SystemSoundsp  pBoth of these answer some of my requirements, but neither seems to be a seamless fit.  Should I just go the AVAudioPlayer multithreading nightmare road  Or the SystemSound multifilewithdifferentvolumelevels nightmare road  Or is there a better way to do thisp  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 227 pWeve started to research the possibility of creating the LOB W8 Store apps pushed to Surfaces through ourcustomers domain store. Weve got a portfolio of working WinForms and WPF apps written in .Net, and are thinking of migrating some of them to Surface because of the customers preferences.

On the other hand, JS is IMHO, again unusable for DomainModel application because the code would have to be rewritten no time for that and, despite the language and typechecks introduced in JS, I think the language is hardly usable for our DomainModel requirements and learning curves.p  pFrom what I was thinking, strongis there a possibility of writing the UI part in HTMLCSSJQueryJS and DomainModel parts in .NetCstrong So that wed have a bunch of HTMLs, JS and, lets say ViewModels to bind to, and a domain DLL written in C I mean to use it similarly to creating a solution in C.Net and adding a couple of C and VB.Net projectsdll references to it and referencing the classes in itp  pI read that the only way how to achieve this since the JS app is native AFAIK, is to use the Interops and COMs, and, Im afraid that this would not be possible with our software.p  pThank you guys.p

Negative 227 pI am trying to design a database for an ecommerce project.p  pThe current models are categories which have a foreignkey to themselves and products which have a fk to a category. What I am trying to implement now is custom properties.p  pEssentially, I want to be able to dynamically specify the properties for a given category. For example, in the monitors category, I would want to be able to specify that products in this category will have a resolution property. Note that this is something I want to do dynamically  I do NOT want to hardcode in any properties. The obvious solution to this is to use EAV. However...p  pWhen a user navigates to a given category, I need to be able to let them specify and filter based on custom properties. In other words, I want to let a user navigate to the monitors category and specify that they only want to see monitors with a resolution  1080p. Well, this is where it gets complicated. I need to know, just based on a category, what properties like resolution are available, AND what possible values they have like 1080p.p  pI cannot for the life of me figure out an appropriate model... can anyone point me in the right directionp  pNOTE I am currently using MySQL, but I am definitely open to other options. For example, I know that NoSQL dbs offer the ability to have N user defined files because you are just storing arbitrary data so if MySQL or even SQL altogether cannot provide a 1 reasonably elegant and 2 reasonably efficient solution, I am totally willing to consider other technologies.p

Negative 227 pSo I have two classes  codeFilecode and codeFileSetcode, which have a bidirectional manymany relationship linked by a join table codeFILEFILESETcode.p  pOne File can be part of many FileSets, and vice versa. Alterations to FileSets are cascaded to individual files through the codeManytoManycascade  CascadeType.Allcode annotation but not the other way round. In particular, it is not uncommon to encounter 1000 files in a FileSet. We have the code for these classes up and running, but we have a problem when we try to delete individual Files from FileSets while the deletion occurs correctly, as the number of files in the set increases, the time taken for deletion scales with On2. This is because the current code for deleting the FileSetFile association gets an instance of the FileSet, removes the File and then saves the updated FileSet with codeSaveOrUpdatecode, which in turn saves all the associated Files. p  pThis is fine for small sets, but gets restrictively slow when there are many Files in a FileSet. Unfortunately, FileSet objects are saved at a number of other points in the code where cascading is a good thing, so Id rather not turn off cascading altogether.p  pSo, to reach my actual question is there a way in hibernate to remove a specific association between two objects For example, is there an HQL query I could run to remove the entry from the join tablep

Negative 227 pHi for the print method to work on excel i need the printername and the port name like this printer On NE3 just as an example. The problem is, is that I use a virtual printer and the port is different, pretty much every time i need to use it.p  pThe program needs to run in the background, so open dialog boxes to choose is not an option. I have also tried to retrieve the port name from WMI with thisp  precode    protected string FindPrinterWithPortstring printerName              StringBuilder query  new StringBuilder         query.AppendSELECT  FROM Win32Printer          query.AppendWHERE DeviceID  printerName         ObjectQuery objectQuery  new ObjectQueryquery.ToString         var searcher  new ManagementObjectSearcherobjectQuery         foreach ManagementObject mo in searcher.Get                      return printerName  On  mo[PortName]                  return string.Empty      codepre  pThe portname i receive doing this gives me the full path to the virtual printer program. I previously used the methods below to change printer for excel, and i alway knew they should be changed eventually, the code is neither fast nor good, but it worked for a while, until I made it multithreaded and its just a big blockade. Because i need to lock these methods not to change the default printer in windows.p  precode    private bool SetPrinterForExcelstring printerName         string[] ports  new string[]Ne00, Ne01, Ne02, Ne03, Ne04,             Ne05, Ne06, Ne07, Ne08,                 Ne09, Ne10, Ne11, Ne12,                 Ne13, Ne14, Ne15, Ne16,                 LPT1, LPT2, File, SMC100         foreach string port in ports                      string printerWithPort  printerName   On   port             bool success  SetAndTestPrinterprinterWithPort             ifsuccess                 return true                   return false          private bool SetAndTestPrinterstring printerWithPort              try                      excel.ActivePrinter  printerWithPort             return true                  catch                      return false               codepre  pAny Idea how to retrieve the port, or is there a way from WMI query i can get the correct port.p  pThanks in advancep  pEditp  pI have not gotten it work getting, what i have done to print now is change the default printer on windows and then just do the print method on my excel object. I Changed it by usingp  precode    [DllImportwinspool.drv, CharSet  CharSet.Auto, SetLastError  true]     public static extern bool SetDefaultPrinterstring Name codepre  pAnd i lock it method and print. I have thought about trying to do a lock and save the ActivePrinter, even tho i believe performance will properly just as bad. Because the lock will stay until the default printer is changed, which takes sometimes up to 1 second, in a multithreaded envirorment thats is a very long lock.p  precode string printernamewithPort  string.Empty  lock ActivePrinterLock       SetDefaultPrinterprintername     printernamewithPort  excel.ActivePrinter    foreach Worksheet worksheet in workbook.Worksheets       worksheet.PageSetup.PaperSize  XlPaperSize.xlPaperA4     worksheet.PageSetup.Orientation  XlPageOrientation.xlPortrait     worksheet.PageSetup.FitToPagesWide  1      worksheet.PageSetup.FitToPagesTall  false     worksheet.PrintOutExActivePrinter printernamewithPort,Collate true, Preview false, PrintToFile false   codepre  pWhat i dunno is that, if the default printer changes right away from another thread, if it looses the port given to the virtual printer. I have not done proper testing of this. In normal circumstances it seems that my Method FindPrinterWithPort would work.p

Negative 227 pIm building a 16 state FSM on a PIC18 with C18. Im considering having each state as its own function which jumps to and gets jumped by other states. Im tempted to just write a branch cases of states at the end of each state to determine where the program should go, but Im thinking this would die pretty quickly since the compiler likely expects this to return, not branch forever the stack on my microcontroller would quickly fill up and eventually overflow. p  pIs C18 smart enough to know that my function call will never return back and replace the instruction with a GOTOJMP instead of a CALLBRANCH accordingly Im aware GOTO exists in C and is usually strongly advised against for readability reasons but I cant think of more appropriate reason to use it than here. Im aware that I can just force it to goto with an asm endasm block, but Ill save myself the trouble if its not necessary. What would be the best way in C to say to go to a function and never come backp  pNaturally, all help is appreciatedp

Negative 227 pIf we take a look under the umbrella of Accelerate Framework we will see several libraries img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comEatnT.jpg altAccelerate Frameworkp  pI know that BLAS and LAPACK are open source and that the same code used otherwhere can be compiled against Accelerate. But what about vForce, vMathLib and other in vMisc and vDSP Is there any open source equivalent for those librariesp  h2EDITh2  pLet me elaborate it a little more only know I have knowledge enough to do so. Basically, vDSP, vFoce and vMathLib are vector oriented libraries. So, if we have a vector and want to calculate a componentwise function over it, say sin and cos, it is faster to use vvsincos from Accelerate because it will pipeline the calculations of sin and cos for all the entries in the vector, which is faster than using a for loop over the vector. Simply expanding those functions in Taylorseries and using trigonometric relations, we see that there are several repetitive calculations going on and the framework tries to avoid this.p  pThis is the same for FFT under vDSP and so forthp  pThan, my problem is what is the BEST open source equivalent to this And if I develop my project under Accelerate, how can I distribute it using open source tools without needing to rewrite my codep

Negative 227 pI am planning on creating an application that will allow multiple devices running the application to send messages urlsidsstrings to a another device running the application.p  pSo if I had 4 devices. Device A, B, C amp D. Device A decides to become the host device, devices B, C amp D will then like to see Device A through the app, and then send some requests to Device A.p  pMy challenge is picking the correctmost efficient and cost effective method of doing this.p  pI have considered the following optionsp  ul liPeerto Peer connectionli liStarting and running a server on host device on the flyli liPush notifications li ul  pI have deliberately avoided the user of a middleman server as I want to avoid additional costs as I do not have any foresight on how this app will do commercially. I secondly must mention that at any one time, I would not expect more than 10 devices would want to send messages to this Host Device and no more than 50100 messages to be sent over the course of 5 hours. So not to taxing.p  pAll the devices would be on their individual mobile networks but potentially on the same wifi. I do not want to restrict this to being on the same network.p  pAny thoughts on what would be the best option in my case would be greatly appreciated. I am personally leaning towards peertopeer as it would seem easiest to implement and would do fine with the number of requests the host device would be able to handle.p  pThanks in advance, Jamesp

I moved the code out of validate and instead its run by clicking resize button.p  pSo you can se the red panel lower should emnotem be visible until scroll is clicked, at which point yellow scrolls up while red scroll into view. And then back again in the opposite direction. To do this, I need the yellow panel taking up all the vertical height and if I can do this with a layout manager then yay.p  pIve updated the original snippet and the diagram to mirror the names used in here.p  pThanksp
Negative 227 pIm working on a quite large and messy project that I havent really got time to clean up and Ive been tasked with providing an API for it.

It works just fine with different but same order of magnitude values of d and ds.p  precoded250e9 ds1e9 xlim0  while xlim lt d2ds     xlim  xlim  ds end  dispxlim codepre  pxlim is returned as 1.25e7. Then,p  precodexrel  xlimdsxlim codepre  pThis displays xrel, which starts at 1.25e7 and ends at 1.24e7. Incidentally, there are exactly 250 values later in my code I count on this being an odd value. Any ideas on a work around Thanksp

Negative 227 pIm trying to understand why the code below does not compile. The error I get isp  blockquote   pMyClass does not implement interface member IFace.Deliver. MyClass.Deliver cannot implement IFace.Deliver because it does not have the matching return type of IDoSomething.p blockquote  pPlease note that I am not asking for someone to reword the compiler error and and simply tell me the same thing as the compiler, or to say, ...the compiler doesnt support it, nor am I asking how to fix the code to make it compile I can do that by uncommenting the method shown in the example.p  pIm trying to understand the rationale in the code not compiling. If someone could point me to a location in the C specification that addresses this issue, that would be perfect.p  pTo my way of thinking, the code should be valid becausep  ol liIts logically valid. A ThisOrThat object IS a proper implementation of IDoSomething unless theres some subtle issue Im missing.li liIt is consistent with the spirit of polymorphism. If a method is declared as returning an interface, it must return an instance of a concrete class which implements the interface. Why should it be invalid then for the same method to be declared as returning a concrete class that implements the interface The compiler can certainly verify the class implementation. And yes, I already know the compiler does not approve.li ol  pAdmittedly, 2 is a rather vague reason and I dont want to get into a philosophical discussion. Im really looking for a technical reason why it doesnt work.p  pAs I said, I know what I need to do to fix it but I really want to understand WHY it should not compile as written.p  precode  interface IFace       IDoSomething Deliver       interface IDoSomething         class ThisOrThat  IDoSomething         class MyClass  IFace       public ThisOrThat Deliver          return new ThisOrThat              Uncomment the lines below to make it compile.

Negative 227 pLets say I get an object from REST web service and this object has a time stamp. This time stamp has a milliseconds component.

If I round the time stamp down, Ill always get the object back as if its always modified. If I round it up I risk missing some updates.

Negative 227 pIntro Im trying to quick hack fix old code and use try MSVC extension to check if some ptr points to some legit memory or if ptr will cause memory violationif so I drop processing of this ptr. So I wrote something likep  precodebool checkIsPtrPointingToValidAddressconst void ptr      try              auto cpy  intptr  force mem access...         if  cpy 42 ampamp randrandrandrand rand  1                      FILE pFile  fopen tempdata.dat,w ... by unlikely but possible action              fputs  ,pFile              fclose pFile                  return true          except1              return false        codepre  pThing is that my solution to force mem access seems weird, ugly, and as a bonus Im not sure it is correct. Also please not I cant disable optimizations on the entire project, so that is not an option.

Negative 227 pOne of our PostgreSQL queries started getting slow 15 seconds so we looked at migrating to a Graph database.  Early tests show significantly faster speeds, so AWESOME.p  pHeres the problem we still need to store a backup of the data in Postgres for nonanalytics needs.

Negative 227 pI currently have a script in R studio that loops around 2000 times codeforcode loop, and on each loop it queries data from a database using a url link and the coderead.csvcode function to put the data into a variable.p  pMy problem is when I query low amounts of data around 10000 rows it takes around 12 seconds per loop and its fine. But now I need to query around 50000 rows of data per loop and the query time increases quite a lot, to 50 seconds or so per loop.

Negative 227 pIve got similar code elsewhere in our project but I cant seem to get it to work the same in this section. What is supposed to happen is when the form submit button is clicked, the form is bound until I specify to unbind it and it opens a dialog window. When the user clicks yes or no the form should unbind and submit but the submit portion doesnt seem to be working properly.p  pIm fairly certain the unbind is working because I can press yes or no and the window will close. I can then press the submit button again and it successfully submits the form.

Negative 227 pIve been working on a project that has recently migrated from Subversion to Git. I had been committing to the Subversion repo via codegitsvncode prior to the migration. After the migration, I noticed a fair amount of history has been lost because each of my merge commits from topic branches have been squashed either via the codegitsvncode bridge, or due to the migration, losing some of the commit messages I want to keep. Is it possible to use my local copy of the premigration repo to unsquash the merge commits in the postmigration repo, perhaps via something like cherrypickingp
Negative 227 pIn my iPad app, I have custom codeUITabBarItemcode images. I set the selected and unselected icons. The selected icon is red, and the unselected icon is the outline of the red icon, but in gray. When a codeUIModalPresentationSheetcode is pulled up, the default behavior of the app is to tint the background gray, along with bar button items and views. However, the active tab bar item remains colored. When I use the default tab bar items, it auto tints to gray. How can I tint my custom tab bar item to match everything else in the background while the modal view is activep  pHere is what I use to use my custom imagep  pappdelegate.mp  precode BOOLapplicationUIApplication application didFinishLaunchingWithOptionsNSDictionary launchOption       UITabBarController tabBarController  UITabBarController self.window.rootViewController     UITabBar tabBar  tabBarController.tabBar      UITabBarItem home  [tabBar.items objectAtIndex0]      home.selectedImage  [[UIImage imageNamedhomeactive.png] imageWithRenderingModeUIImageRenderingModeAlwaysOriginal]     home.image  [[UIImage imageNamedhomeinactive.png] imageWithRenderingModeUIImageRenderingModeAlwaysOriginal]   codepre

Negative 227 pIm writing a simple program that needs to manipulate arrays of bits. The arrays are loaded from a file using an ifstream I simply read bytes from the file until I hit EOF, pushing each complete array onto a vector.p  pThe crash Im seeing is consistent the 7th call to pushback on the vector fails, in the Release build only. In Debug, to contrast, we can read arrays indefinitely without ever hitting EOF. This would seem to imply some kind of memory screw up, but I dont see anything Im obviously doing wrong. The crash happens regardless of the size of the array and regardless of whether or not I actually read anything from the file. p  pOne caveat Im working here with a library that was provided with literally zero documentation. A prior developer had to reverseengineer the API by dumping the strings from the DLL and doing a lot of experimentation frankly Im amazed we have something that works at all. So Im willing to accept a possible explanation of That library youre working with has hosed your stack, lacking any better ideas.p  pAnyway, heres the codep  precodestdvectorltchargt bufList  Grab new buffer information from the file bufFilename. void loadBuffersint bufWidth, int bufHeight      printfReloading buffers...n      First destroy old buffers, if applicable.     if bufList.empty              for stdvectorltchargtiterator i  bufList.begin i  bufList.end i                      freei                       bufList.clear      printfbufList is empty nown       Read buffers from the file until we hit the end.

Negative 227 pI have a local repo that contains all the code for cloud deployment. This repo contains lots of sensitive files specific to the cloud. All these files have already been committed to a private remote repo hosted on the deployment cloud. Now I want some way to commit that code to a public repo while excluding all the sensitive data files. I was going through a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10475273githavedifferentgitignorefileforeachremotethisa but I think my situation is a little bit different. My current local repo already contains all the sensitive files which have not been added to .gitignore file. If I happen to create a public branch from the deployment branch like thisp  precodedeployment       A gt B gt C gt D                                                                              public           gt A  gt B  gt C  gt D codepre  pThen, for the first iteration A, I would have all those sensitive files in my repo once again. I would then have to do a hrefhttpshelp.github.comarticlesremovesensitivedata relnofollowthisa to get rid of all those sensitive files, modify my .gitignore to exclude those files in future, and then push the public branch to remote.p  pHowever, I cant think of how this would go ahead in the future. p  pShould I be merging my public branch to the deployment I think NO p  pWhen the deployment code is updated, how would I propagate those changes to the public branch In that case, should I merge deployment branch with publicp  pIs there any simpler way to do all thisp

Negative 227 pIn my application i request certain date field from my server, the server returns values like 20140603 000000 EEST , but i need to load that data using GMTGMT2 format, i am using the following code  p  precode double unixTimeStamp  [[date objectAtIndexindexPath.row] doubleValue]         NSTimeInterval intervalunixTimeStamp         NSDate dateToFinal  [NSDate dateWithTimeIntervalSince1970interval]         NSDateFormatter formatter[[NSDateFormatter alloc]init]         formatter.dateFormat  yyyyMMMMdd HHmmss zzz         [formatter setTimeZone[NSTimeZone timeZoneWithAbbreviation[[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] objectForKeytimeZone]] ]         [formatter setDateFormatdd MMMM yyyy]         dateFinal[formatter stringFromDatedateToFinal]             NSLogDate Time lt 3  , dateFinal codepre  pthe user has the possibility to change his timezone, thats why when he saves it its stored in a local cached variable , which i call in the previous code. But the most weird part is ,  if the user changes to GMT 1 or 2 or whatever, the application would still output the same hour time, which is 0000, but if he changes to anything different from GMT, it will change. Its not normal to have GMT,GMT1,GMT4 to output the same hour which is 0000. As a unix timestamp example we have 1401742800, which if u use an online time converter you would get Mon, 02 Jun 2014 210000 GMT , but in the app its neither the same date nor timewhat am i missing p

Negative 227 pWhat techniques do you use to display messages in a GUI without popup dialogsp  pPopup dialogs are generally quite horrible for a user  they get in the way and often you are not interested that you just caused an error. An alternative is just to ignore errors and do nothingp  pHowever, there may be the occasional user who wants to know when they caused an error...p  pSo you want to display informative messages but without requiring that the user has to click away annoying popup boxes. p  pOne option could be to use a statusbar of the mainwindow, but in order for any widget to use it, you need to pass around references to this damn statusbar Im thinking of pythonqt here...it quickly gets confusing and removes resuability of your widgets imagine you create another app, without a statusbar and you want to reuse a widget in it......p  pAny ideasp

Negative 227 pI am new to Android so I am making a coloring book app just to get myself acquainted to android programming. I have looked up my problem extensively and implemented the solutions but still no progress.p  pI have an activity ColoringActivity which calls a class PaintView which extends surfaceview. I am trying to update the canvas in a separate thread. I also have a button in the layout which takes the user to another activity for picking colors. The problem is that when the user returns after choosing the color, the canvas becomes empty and I cant draw on the canvas anymore. I think i somehow loose the thread in between activities and although the thread is running in the background, I have no access to it. p  pI read on this forum that I must implement pause and resume methods in the thread class and basically kill the thread when I go to another activity and restart it when I return. Also I read I have to override onPause and onResume method in activity class and construct the surfaceview in onResume so that it is constructed every time user returns to this activity.p  pI am sorry if it doesnt make much sense because I am lost as well.p  pMy ColoringActivity  p  precodepackage com.ali.coloryourself  import android.app.Activity import android.content.Intent import

Negative 227 pMy team and I are building on a large web application project that uses older versions of popular JavaScript libraries jQuery, Backbone, Underscore, etc.. Were currently trying to phase in the use of TypeScript for new solutions as well as for replacing existing JavaScript code. Because our project is heavily dependent on specific JS library versions e.g. jQuery 1.8.3, updating these libraries to the newest versions is slightly more complicated than just downloading and dropping in the most recent version. p  pThis creates a problem for us in regard to phasing in TypeScript we need declarations of dated JS library versions that are compatible with the latest TypeScript standards. Although a hrefhttpsgithub.comborisyankovDefinitelyTyped relnofollowDefinitelyTypeda does a great job at providing declaration files for the  strongneweststrong versions of JS libraries specific to the stronglateststrong version of TypeScript, it doesnt provide declaration files for strongolderstrong JS library versions that are compatible with the latest TypeScript standards.p  pIt seems that as TypeScript grows, all of the older library declarations e.g. jQuery1.8.3.d.ts are left in the dust because those libraries are simultaneously evolving. This is completely understandable as I dont expect there to be much of an effort in the community to continuously update dated library declaration files so that they are compatible with the new TypeScript standards.p  pSo my question is strongwhat is the best way to go about phasing in new TypeScript code that relies heavily on older JS librariesstrongp  pBelow is an example of a problem that Im running into. Im essentially trying to create a Backbone application using TypeScript.p  precode Model.ts  import Backbone  requirebackbone export class NewModel extends Backbone.Model      ...  codepre  pAnd because were using AMD with require.js we get the something like the followingp  precode Model.js ... define[require, exports, backbone], functionrequire, exports, Backbone  ...  codepre  pThis is great and its exactly the output that we want because our require.config file defines all of the libraries that we needp  precode Config.ts require.config     baseUrl .,     paths          jquery ..jquery1.8.3.min,         underscore ..underscoreunderscore.min,         backbone ..backbonebackbone,         text ..requiretext     ,     shim          jquery              exports          ,             underscore              exports          ,         backbone              deps [underscore, jquery],             exports Backbone                codepre  pHowever, strongTypeScript wont let us compile this code unless we have a embackbone.d.tsem that describes the structure of our embackbone.jsem library and provides an ambient declaration of the backbone modulestrong. p  precode backbone.d.ts declare module Backbone      ...     export class Model extends ModelBase          ...          ...  declare module backbone      export  Backbone    Model.ts  ltreference pathpathtobackbone.d.ts gt  import Backbone  requirebackbone export class NewModel extends Backbone.Model      ...  codepre  pIf we dont have these declarations then we have no ambient declaration of the Backbone module and thus cant codeextend Backbone.Modelcode in TypeScript because codeBackbone.Modelcode is not defined as a class anywhere. This is a bit of an exaggerated sample problem because the codeModelcode class type exists in all backbone.d.ts files regardless of the version. However, there are more subtle changes to JS libraries that can cause your code to break if you dont have an accurate .d.ts file to represent it. p  pThat being said, you can also get away with using a more recent version of the .d.ts file which we have been doing as long as you only use the parts that actually exist the associated JS library and as long as you use them directly. Otherwise, if you use a function that doesnt exist or if you pass a function too many parameters, then you will only see that error when the function is actually invoked. TypeScript wont pick up on it because its information is based solely on that of the .d.ts file.p  pWe could generate the codedefinecode requirements using the emamd dependency workaroundem with something likep  precode Model.ts   ltamddependency pathbackbone gt var Backbone  requirebackbone export class NewModel extends Backbone.Model      ...  codepre  pWhich would generate the followingp  precode Model.js ... define[require, exports, backbone], functionrequire, exports  var Backbone  requirebackbone ...  codepre  pThis gives us the codeBackbonecode reference that we want but TypeScript still complains because it has no knowledge of the codeBackbonecode variable that were declaring. In other words, it doesnt provide the structure that the .d.ts file provides. p  pMost of our TypeScript solutions are actually working as they should despite our lack of correlation between .js files and their associated .d.ts files. My concern is strongin the future will this discrepancy cause major problems in our applicationstrongp  pRight now, the best solutions I can think of are top  ol liGet the .d.ts versions closest to our JS library versions and update them so that they are compatible with the latest TypeScript standards.li liUse the most recent .d.ts files and update them accordingly as we run into problems.li ol  pIm not particularly thrilled about either solution, which is why Im reaching out for another opinion. If anyone is still with me at this point sorry for dragging this on, then I would appreciate your proposed solution.p

Negative 227 pIm trying to understand how a java client application that communicates, through JDBC, with a pgSQL database server can catch the result produced by a query that will be fired using a trigger whenever a record is inserted into a table.p  pSo, to clarify, via JDBC I install a trigger procedure prepared to execute a query whenever a record is inserted into a given database table, and from this querys execution will result an output wrapped in a resultSet, I suppose. And my problem is that I have no idea how the client will be aware of those results, that are asynchronously produced.p  pI wonder if JDBC supports any callback mechanism able to catch the results produced by a query that is fired through a trigger procedure under the INSERT INTO table condition. And if there is no such callback mechanism, what is the best approach to achieve this resultp  pThank you in advance p

Negative 227 pIve been working on an iOS application in Swift much of it being moved from ObjectiveC.  Im using Core Data and trying to use extensions to add functionality to classes autogenerated from my model.

Negative 227 psince i am trying the switch first time new to android i am not sure how to handle this issue. i have a switch on an activity and an attached setOnCheckedChangeListener to it. when the activitys oncreate is called i make an async call to database and depending on the values received i set the status of the switch onoff. Now the problem is that however i am setting the switch state to just show whats its current status on db and no user has changed it yet, still the listner function is called. i know that the code is working correctly but with the state changed listner i need something else to confirm that the state has been changed by the user . i think  onTouchEventMotionEvent event can fill the purpose but do not know hot to use it in conjuction with switch.setOnCheckedChangeListenerp  pdoes anyone know of any better solution to it or atleast can help me telling how to use ontouch even with listner...p  precodeswrecordingswitch.setOnCheckedChangeListenernew OnCheckedChangeListener          public void onCheckedChangedCompoundButton buttonView, boolean isChecked      codepre  pthanks p

Im talking about any general object the numbers in the following are only an example.p  pSince random.shuffle acts inplace and returns None, that makes it slightly clunky to shuffle a slice or subset of that list. For a slice or subset, is there a better way than taking the slice or a deepcopy, shuffling it, then overwriting the original list slice with the result i.e. as follows p  precodeimport copy import random  class SomeNumberobject  just a stupid class to illustrate the point     def initself, n         self.n  n     def reprself         return strself.n  ll  [ SomeNumberi for i in range6 ]  [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]   Say we want to shuffle slice 2end ld  copy.deepcopyll[2] ld  ll[2]  [2, 3, 4, 5] random.shuffleld  [3, 2, 4, 5]   ll didnt get shuffled though, so must overwrite the original slice... ll[2]  ld  [0, 1, 5, 3, 4, 2]  del ld codepre  pConsider also the more general case where I might want to pass a boolean vector of which elements are to be included in the shuffle. Then extract that subset, shuffle it and reinsert it.

Negative 227 pIm using dynamic URLs in my application for easy readability. The url structure is code[organizationslug][productslug]code. In other words, an codeorganizationcode is the owner of a codeproductcode. For security purposes, I want to display a 404 when somebody types an organization in the URL when it doesnt exist. Also similarly, display a 404 when a product that doesnt exist is entered into the URL.p  pIve implemented the Ember 404 as described a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions14548594howtohandlenoroutematchedinemberjsandshow404pagein this posta. Then, Im hooking into codeafterModelcode to see if the query returned a record and trying to transition into the codefourOhFourcode route if not. Here is my relevant code currentlyp  pcoderouter.jscodep  precodeRouter.mapfunction    this.routefourOhFour, path path   this.resourceorganization, path organizationslug, function      this.resourceproduct, path productslug     codepre  pcoderoutesorganization.jscodep  precodevar OrganizationRoute  Ember.Route.extend   model functionparams      return this.store.findorganization, slug params.organizationslug   ,   afterModel functionorganization, transition      iforganization.getlength  0        If its not a correct URL render the 404       this.transitionTofourOhFour        ,    serialize functionmodel      return organizationslug model.getslug      export default OrganizationRoute codepre  pcoderoutesproduct.jscodep  precodevar ProductRoute  Ember.Route.extend   model functionparams      var self  this      Verify that the product belongs to the organization in the URL     return this.store.findorganization, slug Ember.organizationSlug.thenfunctionorganization        var organizationID  organization.getfirstObject.id       return self.store.findproduct, slug params.productslug, organization organizationID        ,   afterModel functionproduct      ifproduct.getlength  0        this.transitionTofourOhFour        ,   serialize functionmodel      return productslug model.getslug      export default ProductRoute codepre  pThe problem is that the transition is not firing. The route is not activating and the template is not being rendered. I think this has something to do with the fact that the route exists due to the nature of the dynamic URL. However, I want to maintain the URL path but display the 404 template, which is not working properly. If I change the codepathcode of the 404 route to a static string like code404code the transition works. However, Id like to keep the URL path of the original request if possible.p  pThat way, if someone requests a route that emactuallyem doesnt exist i.e. codefoobarbazcode, it will look identical to a page where the route is valid but the record does not exist. Can anyone point me in the right directionp  pThanks in advancep

For example codeNotFoundExceptioncode indicates an HTTP 404 not found response code, although one could have created a general codeWebApplicationExceptioncode instance with a response code of 404.p  pIs there some simple way for me to take a nonsuccess HTTP response code and create the appropriate codeWebApplicationExceptioncode subclass one of those defined in the JAXRS API Or am I forced to create a factory method with a big codeswitchcode statement to do thisp

Negative 227 pI would like to construct an answer that is very detailed in preparation for software engineering interviews and also to really understand what happens under the hood. p  pWhat I have right now isp  blockquote   pWhen you key in the url, there is a TCP handshake that occurs between   ones browser and the server. Once connection is established, the   request for the webpage is routed to a server via a loadbalancer in   the data centre. That particular server will return the webpage to the   browser, which renders it for display based on DOM rules specified in   the webpage.   Hence, the speed of connection is affected by   1 Location of data centre   2 Routing algorithm used by the load balancer    3 Time taken for the server that contains the webpage to clear the requests sent its wayp blockquote  pThis is an answer I gave in an interview, which was deemed insufficient. I understand its probably rudimentary and am on a determined path to understanding as much as possible about this process. Please can someone shed good light on this questionp

Negative 227 pThis is a two part question. Im trying to use JUnit for a project Im working on in Sublime Text 3.

Negative 227 pIn my chrome app, Ive successfully downloaded image files from the network and stored them in the Chrome App persistent filesystem storage.p  pFor example, the app might download a file named foo.png and store it in the file system with that same name. The app is then able to read the file from the file system using the same name. However, if the javascript tries to set the src on an  using the same name it failsp  precodeimage.attrsrc, foo.png codepre  pIf instead, I read the file and store its contents in a blob, then use the blobURL it works. However, if instead of an image, Im setting the src for an iFrame, and the contents of the iFrame have links to other assets, the app fails to load the other assets as it doesnt seem able to access the assets with their vanilla file names.p
Negative 227 pI am connecting to a remote database and through a statement retrieving a resultset.  I am doing this in a separate thread as network activity is not allowed on the main thread.p  pI want to present this data in a list view.p  pA lot of the examples I see have the same thread populating an array or something with the entire contents of the resultset.  But I am thinking this makes some assumption about the number of records.p  pI am minded to create my own adapter that will on its one side retrieve data from the resultset and on the other supply the list with view content.  However I do not know how much of the resultset the dB driver will fetch at a time and presumably sooner or later the call to resultset.next inside the adapter will result in network activity and presumably this will be occurring on the main thread.  p  pI am thinking I could try to find a way to manipulate my statements and retrieve the first n records then detect the bottom of the list and retrieve the next n records but not sure really how this would work with the existing listview and sounds a bit clunkyp  pOn the other hand perhaps the driver populating the current window of underlying data for the result set is all managed on a separate thread anyway and I dont have to worry about anything.p  pAssuming I do have to worry about it what are the recommended strategies for resolving this issuep

Negative 227 pIve identified the bottleneck in my program as the copy operation from intaking a wchar[] and initializing a string from it, thus copying the buffer.p  precodeconst stdwstring name  payloadgtHeadergtName codepre  pThis code happens over and over again with different values, but for the lifetime of codenamecode, the payload struct cannot change. So there is only need for a single buffer to exist. The wchar array comes from an API that cannot change. And there is subsequent code that expects codenamecode to be a wstring and is well optimized already and I consider it cleaner that it uses wstring and not arrays.p  pI know under the hood, wstring is just a wchar buffer anyway. What I need is like the general equivalent of stdmove but for this special case. Is there no standard way to even signify the emintentem here, so the compiler could maybe optimize this if it canp

Negative 227 pI am a beginer trying to make a gallery for my site, but I am failing somewhere. What I am trying to do is create a page with menu on the top and then under it boxes of small pictures. When you click on one of them, the picture should be loaded under those boxes. So far I have my menu done, and I have the boxes with the pictures, but the problem is that when you first load the page all of the pictures in the small boxes are loaded under and when you click on any boxes  they disapear and only the selected picture is loaded, as it should be. So my problem is that I cant make the page not load all those pictures when loaded for a first time. I dont mind if it just loads one of them, but not all.

Negative 227 pIm working on a management system for a small library. I proposed them to replace the Excel spreadsheet they are using now with something more robust and professional like  PhpMyBibli  a hrefhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiPhpMyBibli relnofollowhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiPhpMyBiblia  but they are scared by the amount of fields to fill, and also the interfaces are not fully translated in Italian.p  pSo I made a very trivial DB, with basically a table for the authors and a table for the books. The authors table is because Im tired to have to explain that codeGabriele DAnnunzio  Gabriele dAnnunzio  Dannunzio G.code and so on.p  pMy test tables are now populated with  100k books and  3k authors, both with plausible random text, to check the scripts under pressure.p  pFor the public consultation I want to make an interface like that of Gallica, the website of the emBibliothque nationale de Franceem, which I find pretty useful. A sample can be seen here a hrefhttpgallica.bnf.frSearchArianeWireIndexindexampp1amplangENampftypedoclivreampqComputerampx0ampy0 relnofollowhttpgallica.bnf.frSearchArianeWireIndexindexampp1amplangENampftypedoclivreampqComputerampx0ampy0ap  pThe concept is pretty easy for each menu, e.g. the author one, I generate a fancy codeltselectgtcode field with all the names retrieved from the DB, and this works smoothly.p  pThe issue arises when I try to add beside every author name the number of books, as made by Gallica, in this way warning  conceptual code, not actual PHPp  precodeSELECT id, surname, name FROM authors foreach row      SELECT COUNT as num FROM BOOKS WHERE idauthid     echo ltoptiongtsurname, name numltoptiongt  codepre  pWith the code above a core of the CPU jumps at 100, and no results are shown in the browser. Not surprising, since they are 3k queries on a 100k table in a very short time.p  pJust to try, I added a LIMIT 100 to the first query on the authors table. The page then required 3 seconds to be generated, and 15 seconds when I raised the LIMIT to 500 seems a linear increment. But of course I cant show to library users a reduced list of authors.p  pI dont know which hardwaresoftware is used by Gallica to achieve their results, but I bet their budget is far above that of a small village library using 2nd hand computers.p  pDo you think that to add a numberofbooks field in the authors table, which will be updated every time a new book is inserted, could be a practical solution, rather than to browse the whole list at every requestp  pBTW, a similar procedure must be done for the publication date, the language, the theme, and some other fields, so the query time will be hit again, even if the other tables are a lot smaller than the authors one.p

Negative 227 pLong story cut short  I have an app that has been around for about 4 years now with a smallish user base around 500 devices.

Negative 227 pI have this tablep  precodecreate table myTable keyword text, category text, result text                     , primary key keyword,category  insert into myTable values     foo,       A, 10,     bar,       A, 200,     baz,       A, 10,     Superman,  B, 200,     Yoda,      B, 10,     foo,       C, 10 codepre  pI want to retrieve results according to tuples codekeyword,categorycode. So basically, with one easy tuple I have the following queryp  precodeSELECT result FROM myTable WHERE keyword LIKE a AND category  A  returns 10,200 as expected codepre  pBut I can have as many tuples as I want. Extending this query for several tuples returns bad resultsp  precodeSELECT result FROM myTable     WHERE  keyword LIKE a AND category  A     AND    keyword LIKE Superman AND category  B  expected 200 but returned no rows...  SELECT distinct result FROM myTable     WHERE  keyword LIKE a AND category  A     OR    NOTkeyword LIKE Superman AND category  B  expected 10 but returned 10,200... codepre  pThats pretty logical because PostgreSQL does not follow the operator order and parenthesis.p  pOnly codeORcode clauses are working.

Negative 227 pI recently upgraded from Magento 1.5 to 1.9 and I have noticed some odd behavior with datestimes.  I cant say I payed much attention to this prior to the upgrade, so Im going to try to go back and test this on 1.5 to confirm it didnt happen.  So far I have tested this on our live production website, my local dev copy of our site, and a clean Magento CE 1.9.1.0 that has no customizations at all, and I get the same results every time.  The problem Im seeing is that, in some cases, the customer Created at time gets buggered such that the Month and Day values get swapped.  The steps to reliably reproduce arep  ol liPlace an order on the frontend, using the option to save your account for later useli liGo into the admin and view the customers account.  Take note of the Created at time.  Today, for instance, it would say Apr 2, 2015.li liFrom the admin, create a new order for the same customer.li liAfter placing the order, go back to the customers account and look at the Created at time.  Note that it has changed to Feb 4, 2015.li liRepeat steps 34 and note that it has changed the Created at back to Apr 2, 2015li ol  pAs I said, this happens for me on 2 different servers in both our website code and a clean 1.9.1.0 install, which leads me to believe it is a bug in the code and not a configuration issue, but Im not 100 sure.  Timezones, locales, and such can get a little confusing, so I might have something wrong in the setup.  If you have any ideas or cancannot reproduce this, please share your findingsthoughts.p  pThanksp

Negative 227 pI am currently migrating SSIS packages from VS2008 to VS2012 to run on a 64bit server and have come across an issue I cant seem to find a resolution to online. We have several Data Flow tasks that connect and pull data from different Oracle servers. We used the Microsoft OLE DB Provider for Oracle for most of our Data Flow tasks but it appears the Microsoft provider does not have a 64bit version.p  pSo, I created a new connection manager with the Oracle Provider for OLE DB with a successful connection test. Im aware that there are differences between TSQL and PLSQL, also differences in how the Oracle provider reads in data compared to the Microsoft provider inline comments, square brackets...etc, but I cant seem to pinpoint why the following code is failing when I try to preview the results. I believe the issue lies in the CASE statement because when I completely take the case statements out the preview runs fine.p  pAlso, this code runs fine with the Microsoft Provider and also works in TOAD when directly connecting to the Oracle database.p  precodeMy example code  SELECT       CASE           WHEN ORDERNUM IS NOT NULL           THEN 1            ELSE 0       END AS ORDERFLAG   FROM TABLE1  END My example code codepre  pERRORp  blockquote   pThere was an error displaying the preview.

Negative 227 pAlthough there seems to be plenty of information on UISearchControllers, many of the approaches I have found have been deprecated in iOS 8.

Pretty standard boilerplate stuff  just persisting and fetching entities.

Using core data instead of a standard array is where the complication begins, and there isnt sufficient documentation using this particular approach. Open to any and all suggestions.  p  pTo kick things off, lets consider that I have stored my fetched items from core data in a mutable array.

Negative 227 pI have a question in regards to how I would do a lazy initialization of a class variable that holds a function. In the project I am working on  in a view controller  I need to run a function based on information that I will only know after the view controller is created. Hence, I wanted to use a lazy initialization to solve this problem. I suppose I could solve the problem other ways, but now I am curious about what I am not understanding about lazy initialization that I am have such difficulty in figuring out how to get a lazily initialized variable to hold a function. That is, if it can be done at all.p  pHere is some example code of what I am trying to do. I want to be able to call codetalkcode on an instance of codeTestClasscode and then this instance codetccode in this case call codefcode which is either codefoocode or codebarcode depending on circumstances.p  precodeclass TestClass       func foo          printlnfoo           func bar          printlnbar           lazy var f gt           return foo           func talk          f        var tc  TestClass tc.f codepre  pNow, this doesnt compile and I get the errorp  precodePlayground execution failed swiftTesting.playground2830 error TestClass gt  gt  is not convertible to  gt      lazy var f gt   codepre  pThen I tried changing my codefcode lazy var top  precode    lazy var f TestClassgtgt           return foo      codepre  pThis again did not work and now I get the error, codeMissing argument for parameter 1 in callcode. p  pCan anyone shed some light on how to do lazy initialization with a variable containing a function I know that I could work around this by not using lazy initialization but I am hoping that someone can help me understand what I am doing wrong in this situation.

Negative 227 pim searching for a way to paus a thread that for example displays some animation on a scene by switching to a different one. The background is to save cpu load of to mutch executing tasks. I also want to resume the Thread after i switch back to the scene.

When not i will add some example code for sure.p

Negative 227 pSo, heres the use case.  I work for Salesforce Marketing Cloud as a technology architect.  We have a very robust Marketing Cloud app which I dont do any development on.  I dont have access to source codeetc.  I do have access to the application though, as a user.  p  pQuick 2 sentence overview of the application big companies like Company A utilize our software to be able to send billions of emails promotional and transactional to their customers.  So, say you get an email from Company A telling you of all the great products they offer  that email is sent from our system.p  pSo, the use case the Marketing Cloud application, for simplicitys sake, is able to create an email from HTML.  Basically, the user myself can copypaste HTML into the huge text field, and click Save, and the email code is saved into the back end SQL Server table.  This application does not have any kind of source control to manage the different versions of the email that the user decides to createchangemodify.  p  pNow, I have access to develop a customized whatever via CSSJS that has access to all of the elements in the database that the application writes to.  So, if I wanted to grab the latest version of an email saved by a user, I can simply write a SQL query to grab this content. p  pHeres my goal To create a very simple version control system without getting into the source code of the application.  Ambitious, I know.  I have all the different pieces of this mapped out in a document, but the one obstacle Im running into is how can I capture the save event for when a user clicks save and saves an email  I believe this is a client side event, but Im not 100 sure.  My initial thought is to write a browser extension, but not knowing exactly what browser extensions have the capability of doing, Im not sure if this is a good route to take.  How can I capture an event from a UI from a web based application when I dont have access to the source codep

Negative 227 pI have a batch job which reads from the database, does some processing and writes the results out to a CSV. Im using spring boot for coding this job. In my code I want to use nonpersisted inmemory database for jobRepository. I tried to achieve this by setting MapJobRepository to the job, task and also tried by extending DefaultBatchConfigurer to override jobRepository creation. Still it didnt help much as the JobLauncher is not picking this repository and uses JdbcRepository for some reason. Here is my BatchConfiguration code p  precodeConfiguration EnableBatchProcessing public class BatchConfiguration extends DefaultBatchConfigurer   Logger logger  LoggerFactory.getLoggerthis.getClass  Autowired SomeRepository someRepository  Autowired JobBuilderFactory jobs  Autowired StepBuilderFactory stepBuilderFactory  Bean public ItemReaderltSomeModelgt reader      RepositoryItemReaderltSomeModelgt reader  new RepositoryItemReaderltSomeModelgt     reader.setRepositorysomeRepository     reader.setPageSize10     reader.setMaxItemCount100     HashMapltString,Sort.Directiongt sort  new HashMapltString, Sort.Directiongt     sort.putcolumn1, Sort.Direction.ASC     reader.setSortsort     reader.setMethodNamefindAll     return reader   Override protected JobRepository createJobRepository throws Exception      return new MapJobRepositoryFactoryBean.getObject   Bean public ItemProcessorltSomeModel,ListltSomeModel2gtgt processor      return new SomeItemProcessor   Bean public ItemWriterltListltSomeModel2gtgt writer      ListItemWriterltListltSomeModel2gtgt writer  new ListItemWriterltListltSomeModel2gtgt     return writer   Bean public Job myJobStep s1       JobBuilder jobBuilder  jobs.getmyJob     MapJobRepositoryFactoryBean mapJobRepositoryFactoryBean  new MapJobRepositoryFactoryBean     try              logger.debugSet a inmemory database job repository         jobBuilder  jobBuilder.repositorymapJobRepositoryFactoryBean.getObject         logger.debugInmemory database job repository set      catch Exception exception              exception.printStackTrace          return jobBuilder             .incrementernew RunIdIncrementer             .flows1             .end             .build   Bean public Step step1ItemReaderltSomeModelgt reader, ItemWriterltListltSomeModel2gtgt writer, ItemProcessorltSomeModel, ListltSomeModel2gtgt processor      TaskletStep taskLetStep  stepBuilderFactory.getstep1     .ltStop, ListltGpsDatagtgtchunk1     .readerreader     .processorprocessor     .writerwriter     .build     MapJobRepositoryFactoryBean mapJobRepositoryFactoryBean  new MapJobRepositoryFactoryBean     try              logger.debugSet an inmemory database job repository          taskLetStep.setJobRepositorymapJobRepositoryFactoryBean.getObject         logger.debugInmemory database job repository set      catch Exception exception              exception.printStackTrace          return taskLetStep    codepre  pAfter executing job I still get batch table not found exception p  precodeCaused by com.mysql.jdbc.exceptions.jdbc4.MySQLSyntaxErrorException Table schema.BATCHJOBINSTANCE doesnt exist codepre  pOne solution is to disable automatic job launch by boot by setting spring.batch.job.namesnone But then Ill still like to use boot to launch jobs. Any suggestions on how I can wire the MapJobRepository into JobLauncherCommandLineRunnerp
