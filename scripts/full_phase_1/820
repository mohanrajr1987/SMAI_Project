Positive 820 pIm am trying to use tablesorter to parse json returned for a php POST request.p  pThe Post request returns the json successfully, however, the tablesorter doesnt function correctly.  From what I can tell, only the static table data is taking the tablesorter. The tablesorter is not being applied to the returned JSON data that is being formatted into the table rows.p  pSo basically, what I get is a the filter functionality on the header values that are manually placed in the HTML body.  I believe that this is happening because the returned json is not in the DOM when tablesorter is being applied to the table.  I thought that placing the tablesorter code after the Jquery php post request would fix this, but still not working.p  pIf the problem tablesorter wont work on the returned data, is my only option then to construct the table in the php, and then return the completed table to the page with a php postp  precode.when.post..phploadjson.php,path dir.done     functiondata     var obj  jQuery.parseJSONdata     var html       forvar i  0 i lt obj.length i         html  lttrgtlttdgt  obj[i].vala lttdgtlttdgt  obj[i].valb lttdgtlttdgt  obj[i].valc lttdgtlttdgt  obj[i].vald lttdgtlttdgt  obj[i].vale lttdgtlttrgt   mytable tbody.first.afterhtml                          mytable      .tablesorter     theme blue,     headerTemplate  content icon,     widthFixed true,     widgets [zebra, filter]         lthtmlgtltbodygt     lttable idmytable classtablesortergt     lttheadgtlttrgt     ltthgtvalaltthgt     ltthgtvalbltthgt     ltthgtvalcltthgt     ltthgtvaldltthgt     ltthgtvaleltthgt     lttrgtlttheadgt     lttbodygt     lttbodygt         lttablegt ltbodygtlthtmlgt codepre

Positive 820 pI have created and Instagram clone and I am having some trouble with appending comments to individual codeltdivgtcode elements. What I would like to accomplish is to have a user type some text in the codeltinputgtcode box, click the submit button, and have said text appear under the codeltinputgtcode area via a codeltligtcode in a codeltulgtcode I created called codecommentlistcode. Similarly, I would only like said input to be targeted to each specific image imported from my JSON GET request without text duplication on any single item. The jQuery seems right to be able to append the text, but it isnt working and a fresh pair of eyes certainly wouldnt hurt.p  pHere is the jsbin a hrefhttpjsbin.comtecahaeditoutput

Positive 820 pFirst of all, lets suppose that I have the following canvas codeltcanvas idcan width400 height200 gtcode. And Then, I need to resize it with codewidth 100 height autocode to fit my responsive container. And now, lets suppose that my canvas got a width of 800. And the problem is that everytime when I try the get the positionx, y of a click event, I get the coordinates relative to the actual mouse position.p  pTo be clear, If I click the bottomedge of the canvas, Insted of getting the position400, 200, I get 800, 400.p  pAlready searched on the web for a solution but I cant find my specific problem and neither jQuery or vanilla javascript seems to have a easy approach to the problem. The only solution that I thought of was using a kind of a mathematical relation between the actual canvas dimensions setted in the DOM and the width and height of it after the scaling, but I really cant figure how.p

Negative 820 pDoes anybody know of a fully threadsafe codesharedptrcode implementation E.g. boost implementation of codesharedptrcode is threadsafe for the targets refcounting and also safe for simultaneous codesharedptrcode instance reads, but not writes or for readwrite.p  psee a hrefhttpwww.boost.orgdoclibs1370libssmartptrsharedptr.htmThreadSafetyBoost docsa, examples 3, 4 and 5.p  pIs there a sharedptr implementation that is fully threadsafe for codesharedptrcode instancesp  pStrange that boost docs say thatp  blockquote   psharedptr objects offer the same level of thread safety as builtin types.p blockquote  pBut if you compare an ordinary pointer builtin type to codesmartptrcode, then simultaneous write of an ordinary pointer is threadsafe, but simultaneous write to a codesmartptrcode isnt.p  pEDIT I mean a lockfree implementation on x86 architecture.p  pEDIT2 An example use case for such a smart pointer would be where there are a number of worker threads which update a global sharedptr with a their current work item and a monitor thread that takes random samples of the work items. The sharedptr would own the work item until another work item pointer is assigned to it thereby destroying the previous work item. The monitor would get ownership of the work item thereby preventing the work item to be destroyed by assigning it to its own sharedptr. It can be done with XCHG and manual deletion, but would be nice if a sharedptr could do it.p  pAnother example is where the global sharedptr holds a processor, and is assigned by some thread, and used by some other thread. When the user thread sees that the processor shardptr is NULL, it uses some alternative logic to do the processing. If its not NULL, it prevents the processor from being destroyed by assigning it to its own sharedptr.p

Negative 820 pAn application Im building is generating XHTML documents that are going to be distributed in a bunch of different ways, including email.  I can open these documents in Firefox or Chrome and by open I mean from Windows Explorer, not through a web server.

Sometimes its still running in Task Manager and I have to kill it.  Sometimes not.p  pIf I name them with the extension .htm or .html, then they open properly, except the IE Information Bar comes up telling me that it has blocked content of some kind.

They dont even reference external CSS.p  pWhen the customer Im developing this for opens the documents in emhisem environment hes just using the .xhtml extension at this point, IE opens them and renders them as XML documents.p  pIve spent a fair amount of time on Google to try and get to the bottom of this, and everything I find there has to do with specifying the MIME type in the HTTP header, which is not especially useful as Im not actually serving these files.p  pThe files all seem to have the proper DOCTYPE, processing instruction, and namespace declarations the top of each looks like thisp  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingutf8gt ltDOCTYPE html PUBLIC W3CDTD XHTML 1.0 StrictEN httpwww.w3.orgTRxhtml1DTDxhtml1strict.dtdgt lthtml xmlnshttpwww.w3.org1999xhtmlgt codepre  pAny ideasp
Negative 820 pIm using mootools to toggle the display and existence of two DOM elements in one of my forms.  Then, I am using javascript to validate the form to make sure that all of the required fields were filled in.  The problem is that the the browser seems to be caching the elements.  For example, I have html like thisp  precodeltinput nameinputbox idinputbox typetext gt ltselect nameselection idselectiongt...ltselectgt codepre  pAnd the javascript for validation is something like thisp  precodeif form.inputbox  null ampamp form.inputbox.value      dont submit form  else if form.selection  null ampamp form.selection.value  0    dont submit form  codepre  pNow, this works fine when the page is first loaded and the codeinputcode element has been removed.  However, when I click the button that replaces the codeinputcode element with the codeselectcode element, from then on the codeform.inputboxcode and codeform.selectioncode in the javascript code contain the respective element as it was in its last state in the DOM  even if it is no longer in the DOM.  So is the javascript caching the DOM and not updating the elements when they are removed from the DOM  What is going on here, and, more importantly, how should I go about fixing itp  pEdit I am using mootools to do the removing and replacing of the elements, the documentation for the respective functions can be found a hrefhttpdocs111.mootools.netNativeElement.jsElement.remove relnofollowherea and a hrefhttpdocs111.mootools.netNativeElement.jsElement.replaceWith relnofollowherea.p

Negative 820 pIve found lots of examples of the repository pattern, all of which show the repository managing its own connection lifecycle.  I was wondering how people deal with a case where they want to share a single connection across multiple repositoriesp  pThe main reason Im asking is because when I create a transaction, using TransactionScope, I dont really want it to escalate to an DTC transaction.  It seems a bit heavyweight, though simple to setup.p  pWhat I was thinking was using something similar to the TransactionScope, that would manage a connection lifecycle.  However, it seems that is linking the data access to the business process a little.  An example of what I mean isp  precodeAs DataScope will handle connections, then repositories will be created from them in order to share the connection. usingDataScope scope  new DataScope     scope.GetRepositoryltCustomerRepositorygt.FindById10  codepre
Negative 820 pIs using the synchronized keyword on methods in a Java DAO going to cause issues when used by a web applicationp  pI ask because I have a multithreaded stand alone application that needs the methods to by synchronized to avoid resource conflict, as seen here.p  precodejava.util.concurrent.ExecutionException javax.persistence.PersistenceException org.hibernate.HibernateException Found shared references to a collection com.replaced.orm.jpa.Entity.stuffCollection codepre  pstrongWhat I am concerned about is that when a significant number of people try and use the application that the synchronized methods will block and slow the entire application down.strongp  pI am using a Spring injected JPA entity manager factory, which provides an entity manager to the DAO. I could technically remove the DAO layer and have the classes call the entity manager factory directly, but I enjoy the separation the DAO provides.p  pI should also note that I am being very careful not to pass around connected entity ORM objects between threads. I speculate that the resource conflict error comes about when accessing the DAO. I think multiple threads are going at the same time and try to persist or read from the database in nonatomic ways.p  pIn this case is using a DAO going to do more harm then helpp  phr p  pA big piece of information I left out of the question is that the DAO is not a singleton. If I had been thinking lucidly enough to include that detail I probably wouldnt have asked the question in the first place.p  pIf I understand correctly, Spring creates a new instance of the DAO class for each class that uses it. So the backing entity manager should be unique to each thread. Not sharing the entity manager is, as Rob H answered, the key thing here.p  pHowever, now I dont understand why I get errors when I remove synchronized.p  phr p  pAccording to this a hrefhttpforum.springsource.orgshowthread.phpt33804 relnofollowthreada, the PersistenceContext annotation creates a threadsafe SharedEntityManager. So you should be able to create a singleton DAO.p
Negative 820 pSo the main program is in C.  Inserting new records into a VFP database table.  It was taking too long to generate the next ID for the record via p  precodeselect maxid1 from table codepre  p, so I put that code into a compile dll in VFP and am calling that COM object through C.p  pThe COM object returns the new ID in about 250ms.  I then just do an update through OLEDB.  The problem I am having is that after the COM object returns the newly inserted ID, I cannot immediately find it from C via the OLEDB p  precodeselect id form  table where id  newlyReturnedID codepre  preturns 0 rows back.  If I wait an unknown time period the query will return 1 row.

Negative 820 pI am creating a CMS and am using serialize to handle publish and rollback, which seems to work fine.  Basically, The normal site tables are what gets displayed and anything not displayed is serialized in a separate table.  The problem however is in making the Preview functions work.  p  pSince the front end is created using normal SQL calls, and all the prepublishedrolled back data is in a separate table it would mean updating every sql statement with some fancy code to pull the version correct to the preview.  It will also get especially problematic with things like limits etc and would be a nightmare for the front end.p  pThe only other approach I can see is a separate databasetables for the preview copy, but many people may be using the preview function and I am loathe to create a duplicate database for every person using preview as it will very quickly get out of hand.p  pIs there any way of doing this that will allow preview, and rollback preview, but will not require much from the code that displays the contents of the database and also avoid the problem of mass duplicationp

Negative 820 pIm writing a simple program for file encryption. Mostly as an academic exercise but possibly for future serious use. All of the heavy lifting is done with thirdparty libraries, but putting the pieces together in a secure manner is still quite a challenge for the noncryptographer. Basically, Ive got just about everything working the way I think it should.p  pIm using 128bit AES for the encryption with a 128bit key length. I want users to be able to enter in variablelength passwords, so I decided to hash the password with MD5 and then use the hash as the key. I figured this was acceptablethe key is always supposed to be a secret, so theres no reason to worry about collision attacks.p  pNow that Ive implemented this, I ran across a couple articles indicating that this is a bad idea. My question is why If a good password is chosen, the cipher is supposed to be strong enough on its own to never reveal the key except via an extraordinary read currently infeasible bruteforce effort, right Should I be using something like PBKDF2 to generate the key or is that just overkill for all but the most extreme cryptographic applicationsp

Negative 820 pNow that Im working on my newer application that uses MEF with the MVVM light toolkit, Ive run into a case where I cant load specific plugins because they rely on a part that isnt getting exported.  That part isnt getting exported because its a View, and the View isnt resolved with MEF yet.p  pIt seems that every time I play with MEF, I need to move the part composition step i.e. create container, catalog, then compose parts closer and closer to the main application.  I believe that I am now at that point.  However, the problem is that Im not sure exactly where to put it.  p  pId like to put it MainWindow, which I believe is created by the MVVM light tookit project template.  I have used the codeExportcode attribute on MainViewModel and Model.  I am importing the ViewModel in the ViewModelLocator, and I import the Model in the ViewModel.  To me, this seems like enough to ensure that everything gets composed properly.  However, while the ViewModel is composed properly it hits its constructor, the Model is emnotem.  I checked the output window during composition, and I dont get any MEF errors there.p  pSo in summary, these are my issues 1.  Where is the right place to compose parts  In the WPF  MVVM case, would it always be at the start of the app 2.  In the absence of MEF errors in the output window, what are other techniques to figure out why things arent getting resolved  Normally, I will step all the way through Compose to try to get some insight.  Are there better debugging techniques than this 3.  Can you think of why my Model wouldnt get loaded 4.  Are there good MEF  MVVM light toolkit projects I can download to studyp

Negative 820 pIm currently trying to implement shadow volumes in my opengl world.

Negative 820 pI created a controller in my ASP.NET MVC application to handle the application warmupinitialization i.e. initial loading of web service client proxies and other actions that can initially take a good chunk of time. To call the WarmUp controller, I am using the IIS 77.5 warmup module to send a request whenever the application pool starts up.p  pI do not want all users to be able to execute the WarmUp controller actions, so I decorated the controller with an code[Authorize]code attribute.

However, when using the IIS warmup module, even when I provide proper credentials, I am seeing warnings in my Application event log specifying that the authentication failed.p  pIf I specify only a type and user name for the warmup modules user context, I get a codeProviderExceptioncode with the messagep  blockquote   pMethod is only supported if the user name parameter matches the user name in the current Windows Identity.p blockquote  pIf I specify both a username and passwordtoken, I get an codeArgumentExceptioncode with the following messagep  blockquote   pInvalid token for impersonation  it cannot be duplicated.p blockquote  pIf I remove the code[Authorize]code attribute from my controller, then the warmup modules request goes through without any exceptions.

Negative 820 pIve done several forms that follow a similar patternp  ul liptwo interdependent form fields, lets say street address and location lonlat.pli lipwhen user fills in one field, the other is updated via an ajax call.p  peg. if the user fills in street address, do a request to a geocode API and put the result in the location field if the user fills in the location eg. via a map UI, do a request to a reversegeocode API and put the result in the address field. No problem so far, these are easy to hook up to blur andor focus change events.pli lipThe problem occurs if the form is submitted before an ajax call completes. In this case one field will have a correct value and the other will be stale. The handler on the server needs to detect that this has happened and update the stale value. We cant just check for the default value because the user might have changed both fields any number of times.pli ul  pThere are two possible solutions Ive thought of, and I dont much like either one. Id love other suggestions.p  pstrongSolution 1.strong  Use hidden fields as flags to indicate freshness set the value to 0 by default, reset it to 0 before the ajax request is sent, and set it to 1 when the response comes back.  On the server side, check these fields and recompute any field whose freshness flag is set to 0.  There is still a potential race condition here but the window is greatly narrowed.  Ive used this technique and it works eg. a hrefhttpfixcity.orgracksnew relnofollowhttpfixcity.orgracksnewa.  It is annoying though, as it requires more code on both client and server and is another possible source of bugs.p  pstrongSolution 2.strong Use synchronous AJAX calls instead SJAX.  Not appealing since AJAX here is just a UI convenience, its not strictly necessary for the application to work, so Id rather not make things feel slow  then it becomes UI inconvenience.p  pstrongSolution 3.strong Always do serverside postprocessing. If its expensive, use caching to make it cheaper  eg. if the value is emnotem stale, that means the client just made the same request via AJAX so we should have populated the cache if needed during the AJAX handler. This one currently seems the most appealing to me, although it has two limitations it cant be used for things that are not safe and idempotent  eg. if the AJAX request was doing a POST and it cant even be used for this example because we have two interdependent fields and no way to know which is correct and which is stale.p

Negative 820 pI am a developer who works primarily with embedded devices programmed with C and assembly.  My C and OOP knowledge is very limited although I can fake my way through it when necessary.  I have five devices that interface with a PC via USB.  The PC does some calculations and sends a result to the device.  The same calculations are performed for each device, but the calculations are done differently.  For each device, I have a C Windows Forms application that does some work and sends data back and forth to the device.  Currently, Im trying to get the five different applications merged into one so we can easily make changes, add new devices easily, and have a standard user interface.  My problem is that I dont exactly know the best way to do it since I dont know which device will be used until run time.  Im trying to avoid a bunch of if statements and I would like to be able to put each device in a separate file.  Here is some psudocode of what Im talking about.p  precodeclass Device This is what EVERY device can do  ... DoWork1 DoWork2 DoWork3 ...   class Device1  ...

Determine what device could be one of five is currently being used CurrentDevice  which device is currently being used Could be CurrentDevice  new Device1    private void Button1Click  CurrentDevice.DoWork1 But this could be Device1.DoWork1 or Device2.DoWork1, depending on what device is currently being used which was determined in the frmMain constructor  codepre  pIm not really sure, but Im thinking I could use an interface or maybe inherit the Device1 class for the Device class and override the methods...But I dont know how I would have one generic way of saying CurrentDevice.DoWork1 since CurrentDevice could be Device1 or Device2.p  pAny ideas would be greatly appreciated.

Im developing a website that will allow users to book hotels all around the world, just like booking.com, expedia.com, etc. p  pWhen the user searches for hotels in a certain city, I connect through Web Services with different providers, and then show the results.

The other two points are also necessary, but my intention is to improve the user experience by strongshowing hotels as they loadstrong. p  pLets say you are looking for hotels in Buenos Aires. You enter Buenos Aires as your destination, and hit the Buscar button. As you may notice, a loading message is shown until the following page has been completely loaded. Instead of waiting for all hotels to load, what I would like to do, which I think will improve users experience isp  ol liWhen user hits Buscar button, immeadiately send user to HotelList pageli liShow each hotel as their information is obtained, and a message on the top saying something like Loading 1 of XXX hotels...

Negative 820 pHere is where I am at right now. I have four tables task, project, opportunity, and taskxref. The project and opportunity tables each have a onetomany relationship with task. I am storing those relationships in taskxref. The schema looks something like this for each table simplifiedp  precodetask  idpk name  project  idpk name ...  opportunity  idpk name ...  taskxref  taskidtask id fkeyother table id codepre  pAssume that the keys in project and opportunity will not be the same GUID so an opportunity cant fetch tasks for a project and so on. This works well on the surface, one xref table to maintain the relationships between task and project, opportunity or any other tables that might need a task relationship in the future.p  pMy current dilemma is of bidirectionality. If Im looking to get all the tasks for an individual project or opportunity its no problem. If Im pulling back a task and want to know the name of the related project or opportunity I cant. I have no way of knowing whether the related fkey is a project or opportunity. In the future I will probably have other tables with task relationships while I have 2 tables now, there could be many more in the future.p  pHere are the possible solutions Ive thought of so far 1 separate xref table for each pair e.g. taskprojectxref, taskopportunityxref...    cons I have to run a query for each xref table looking for relationships for a taskp  p2 a third column in taskxref to point to the parent table    cons this seems like a kludge to mep  p3 store the primary keys in project, opportunity in an identifiable way e.g. proj1, proj2, proj3, opp1, opp2, opp3 so I can tell which table a task relates to by looking at the fkey    cons this feels like Im making the primary keys in projects and opportunities magical, imbuing them with more meaning than just being an identifier to a single record maybe Im overthinking itp  pMy question then is this Are there other solutions I am overlooking Which solution is betterworse than the othersp  pI am trying to keep joins limited if possible and performance as good as possible.

Ive tried using strongEncoding.UTF8.GetBytesstrong, strongEncoding.Unicode.GetBytesstrong and strongEncoding.ASCII.GetBytesstrong to convert it to a byte[] that the strongX509Certificate2strong constructor expects.li ulli ol  pI have tried searching Google for every shred of information I can find on how to do something useful ie. decode the ASP Request.ClientCertificate in its raw form but have come up empty. Ive also saved this data to a file and attempted to decode this using CertUtil but it still fails to decode the data and just errors out.p  pAs I continue to play around with this I decided to look at the size of the client certificate returned by ASP and ASP.NET and I found the size to not match. My certificate coming from ASP was 647 bytes and 1295 bytes in ASP.NET. I dont know why the size is skewed between both environments. Consequently I have no issues whatsoever decoding the client certificate returned by ASP.NET using the X509Certicate2 class. p  pIve also tried using the following pinvoked functionp  precode[DllImportcrypt32.dll, CharSet  CharSet.Auto, SetLastError  true] public static extern uint CertCreateCertificateContextuint dwCertEncodingType,    byte[] pbCertEncoded, uint cbCertEncoded codepre  pSo in either case of using X509Certificate, X509Certificate2 and the function above I get a consistent result the certificate coming from ASP is not usable by these functions.

Is there anyway besides parsing code14code from the codeSERVER[REQUESTEDURI]code that I can get it emwith multiviews enabledemp

Negative 820 pWe are having ans issue with our storesite.  We are using jQuery to fire a the AJAXToolkitExtender for a modal.br The issue is that we are supposed to wrap the button in an update panel that calls the jQuery that fires the modal. Our issue lies in that we are getting a double post back in Firefox and Chrome for some reason.  Which in turn when we get an error back from the server to show on the UI it clears our cart.  We want to get the status of our call through jQuery without having to use an UpdatePanel.  UpdatePanels have known issues in Firefox as making a double post back. Does anyone have a straight client site solution or a solution where we dont have to use an update panel to get the status or our calls to the server and show and hide an update panel.

Negative 820 pIm currently completing a project in PHP, but the general principles of OO still apply.p  pI have a parent class called Node, which is abstract  i.e. it cannot be instantiated. There are many classes that extend Node, and are instantiable. Some of these include Event, Person, and Project.p  pThe issue Im having is that I often need to instantiate a Node without knowing which child class it will be. All Node and nodesubclasses always takes the same type of object a row from a database as an argument to the constructor. To get around the problem of not knowing what type of implementing class I need, I created a simple static class that will return the correct subclass of node. An example of this code is as followsp  precodeltphp  class NodeClassRegistry      public static function initclassnode          switch nodegttype              case person                 return new Personnode              case event                 return new Eventnode                  gt codepre  pThis seems like really bad design to me  its kind of a factory pattern, but it seems really tied to global state.

Negative 820 pI have a view based NSTableView that contains cell views that have layers enabled. The NSTAbleView itself is also inside a view that has layers enabled.p  pFor some reason I just get a quick flicker of the table view cells when it first loads, and I have to scroll them in and out to make them appear.p  pI just cant seem to figure out the reason why this is happening, are view based NSTableViews not supported with Core Animation it just sounds strange to me if it isnt.p  pIn general I have problems with Core Animation on OSX as opposed to iOS, and I have several cases where certain views just disappear as soon as I enable layer on their superviews.p  pAfter lots of googling I finally understood the difference in how the system treats layer backed views vs. layer hosting views, and it helped one of the problems I had, but not all.p  pAny input on this is greatly appreciated.p

Negative 820 pIve been doing a fair amount of work with Couch DB in my spare time recently and really enjoy using it. I find it to be much more flexible than using a relational database, but its not without its disadvantages.p  pOne big disadvantage is the lack of dynamic queries  view generation... So you have to do a fair amount of work in planning and justifying your views, as you cant put that logic into your application code as you might do with SQL.p  pFor example, I wrote a login scheme based on a JSON document template that looked a little bit like thisp  precode     id blah,    type user,    name Bob,    email bobtheaquarium.com,    password blah,  codepre  pTo prevent the creation of duplicate accounts, I wrote a very basic view to generate a list of user names to lookup as keysp  precodeemitdoc.name, null  codepre  pThis seemed reasonably efficient to me. I think its way better than dragging out an entire list of documents or even just a reduced number of fields for each document. So I did exactly the same thing to generate a list of email addressesp  precodeemitdoc.email, null codepre  pCan you see where Im going with this question p  pIn a relational database with SQL one would simply make two queries against the same table. Would this technique of equating a view to the product of an SQL query be in some way analogousp  pThen theres the performance  efficiency issue... Should those two views really be just one Or is the use of a Couch DB view with keys and no associated value an effective practice Considering the example above, both of those views would have uses outside of a login scheme... If I ever need to generate a list of user names, I can retrieve them without an additional overhead.p  pWhat do you thinkp

The Live subdomain is on the same server, and in reality, it would be the same svn update ... command as with the DEV, but to a different path.  p  pI was thinking I could have a specific file in my repo, and maybe I could just change this file, and then make some sort of condition in my postcommit file to also update to my live dir if that specific file has changed.  p  pBut I dont know how to write that code.

Negative 820 pthis is crossposted from grailsforum.co.ukp  pHi all, Im relatively new to Grails and Spring, Hibernate, etc so please forgive me if this is a noob question. Googling has got me nowhere, but its rather a difficult problem to search for.p  pWhen I run a particular GORM query in grails 1.1.1, it normally works fine, but in the case where there are no records in the database that match, instead of returning nothing I get an exception bubbling right up from the database driver level. I had wondered if this was an issue with the particular flavour of Oracle my local dev database is running, but this also occurs when running on the inmemory JDBC database, and on the remote dev server which has a database equivalent to the ones our production servers use. It appears, as far as I can tell, that somewhere down the line the query is actually resolving into invalid SQL.p  pThe query is on the domain class CourseTerm, which represents a semester at a university. This class defines starting date and ending date as properties. My query aims to select the set of all course terms active on a given date there may be multiple as they can overlap, as belowp  precodedef currentCourseTermsdate  new Date       return CourseTerm.findAllByCourseStartDateLessThanAndCourseFinishDateGreaterThandate, date  codepre  pAs I say, this works perfectly if there are any course terms which match the query. But in the case where no terms are current, the request fails and I get the following outputp  precodeError 500 org.springframework.dao.InvalidDataAccessResourceUsageException could not execute query nested exception is org.hibernate.exception.SQLGrammarException could not execute query Servlet grails URI ltrpgrailsscheduleableCourselist.dispatch Exception Message ORA00936 missing expression  Caused by org.springframework.dao.InvalidDataAccessResourceUsageException could not execute query nested exception is org.hibernate.exception.SQLGrammarException could not execute query  Class ScheduleableCourseController codepre  pOn my workstation where I get the log output, I also see thisp  precode20120323 150418,664 [13262636qtp214487182] ERROR util.JDBCExceptionReporter   ORA00936 missing expression codepre  pMy research and general intuition tells me that this is probably a bug in Grails or Spring, and that the solution will be to update to a newer version of Grails. This is definitely on the roadmap as Im not a fan of running outofdate webapps at the best of times, but my recent attempt to upgrade to the latest 1.x release was not a success, and I dont have time to fight with it right now.p  pIm working around the problem by catching the exception when the query is called, but there are enough random errors showing up in our logfiles already without adding more, and I would like to get this functioning properly if at all possible. If anyone can advise me of a solution or more elegant workaround, or at least inform me if this is a known issue, I would appreciate it greatly.p

Negative 820 pIm running Mac OS X 10.6.x Snow Leopard right now, so Im pretty sure that there could be some issues with supported systems, but Im trying to install JavaFX 2.0 or 2.1.x in Eclipse Juno for Java EE version 3.8. p  pI have already installed the efxclipse plugin, but Im not sure if Im downloading the right JavaFX .zip file from the Oracle website. I downloaded the JavaFX 2.2 beta release because it seemed to be the only release available for OS X, but I could be wrong. Once I download this archive, Im not exactly what to do with itwhere to place it so that Eclipse recognizes it as the JavaFX 2.2 SDK.

Negative 820 pI am using the classes .js and .nojs on the lthtmlgt element to differentiate between layouts that have Javascript and those that dont. p  pWith the lthtmlgt element, I added a default class of nojs. Then I include a single line of script in the header, codedocument.getElementsByTagNamehtml[0].setAttributeclass,jscode to switch the html class to js. Obviously this line of code will only work for browsers that have js enabled, so the lthtmlgt element will become lthtml classjsgt whereas nonjs enabled browsers will continue to read lthtml classnojsgt.  p  pAnd then I will simply use code.js someElement fontweightboldcode versus code.nojs someElement fontweightnormalcode to style my page differently. p  pHowever, I find that this approach fails dramatically on IE7. On IE7, the script works  or so it seems. On Developer Tools, it shows lthtml classjsgt. However, ALL css styling that start with .js are ignored by IE7, and IE7 behaves as though the lthtmlgt element has a class of .nojs. Check out a hrefhttpbit.lyLMre3N relnofollowhttpbit.lyLMre3Na to get a clearer picture. p  pI cant begin to imagine what exactly is wrong here is this a case of IE7 behaving wrongly when rendering CSS, or is it a case of scripting not working properly Heres what I triedp  pstrongCSSstrongp  ol liChanging the order of .js and .nojs declarations, as I figured it could be the latter overriding the former thats causing the problem  NOPE.li liChanging the order of the script and stylesheets, since it might be because IE7 read the .nojs stylesheet before it read the script  NOPE.li liChanging the specificity of the declarations  perhaps being more specific will lead IE7 to read the .js declarations  NOPE.li liRemoving the .nojs class from the document altogether, hoping that IE7 will thus read .js declarations. NOPE  it simply ignores both the .nojs and the .js declarations. li ol  pIn short, IE7 totally and completely ignore the fact that there is a .js declaration. So I figured it might be the script that had problems, and heres what I didp  pstrongJavascriptstrongp  ol liI added typetextjavascript to ltscriptgt  No effect. li liI tried codedocument.documentElementcode instead of codedocument.getElementsByTagNamehtml[0]code  still the same.li liI used codevar htmlOrWhatdocument.getElementsByTagNamehtml[0] alerthtmlOrWhatcode, FF, Chrome, Opera, Safari, IE8, and IE9 returns [object HTMLHtmlElement], whereas IE7 returns [object], leading me to think IE7 is not reading the lthtmlgt element properly. li liI then tried to read the id and lang attributes of lthtmlgt to test if IE7 is actually reading the element properly and yes, it retrieves these attributes correctly, it just simply refuse to apply .js css declarations to it. li ol  pBy now, Im at my wits end though I suspect the [object] anomaly is related to my problem, and I hope someone here at Stackoverflow will be able to help me out.

Negative 820 pIm seeking to reduce redundant code in my Android project.  Let me tell you what I already have.p  pI have two main groups of views.  One is called MapView, which is a View containing a bitmap that can be zoomed, panned, etc.  The other is called StepInfoView, which is a View that contains static data, such as an array of coordinates and information about those coordinates.  This View is also zoomed and panned emin an identical wayem as the MapView is, however, the scale factors and amount panned needs to be independent from the MapView.p  pStepInfoView is extended by several different classes 6 in total, all of which need to be in sync coordinates are plotted on one, lines between coordinates are plotted on another, etc..p  pSo, here is the gist of my code, currentlyp  precodepublic class MapView extends View      protected float scale  1      protected class ScaleListener extends ScaleGestureDetector.SimpleOnScaleGestureListener              Override         public boolean onScaleScaleGestureDetector detector                      scale  detector.getScaleFactor             return true                      ...   public class StepInfoView extends View      static protected float scale  1     protected class ScaleListener extends ScaleGestureDetector.SimpleOnScaleGestureListener              Override         public boolean onScaleScaleGestureDetector detector                      scale  detector.getScaleFactor             return true                 ... public class StepView extends StepInfoView         Custom onDraw, same scale as PathView  public class PathView extends StepInfoView       Custom onDraw, same scale as StepView  codepre  pAs you see, the onScales are emidenticalem.  I want to create an abstract class to hold the scaling function, let us call it RootView.  Both the MapView and StepInfoView have scales, but I cannot make scale static in RootView because the MapView scale must be independent of the StepInfoView.  Here is a solution that I know would work, but I dont like the clutter of getters and settersp  precodeabstract class RootView extends View      abstract protected float getScale      abstract protected void setScalefloat s     protected class ScaleListener extends ScaleGestureDetector.SimpleOnScaleGestureListener              Override         public boolean onScaleScaleGestureDetector detector                   setScalegetScale  detector.getScaleFactor          return true                ... public class MapView extends RootView      public float scale  1     protected float getScale         return scale           protected void setScalefloat s         scale  s        public class StepInfoView extends RootView      public static float scale  1     protected float getScale         return scale           protected void setScalefloat s         scale  s       public class StepView extends StepInfoView         Custom onDraw, same scale as PathView  public class PathView extends StepInfoView       Custom onDraw, same scale as StepView  codepre  pThat works exactly how I want it to work, but once again, there is duplicated identical code getters and setters and a scale variable in MapView and StepInfoView.p  pWhat I wish I could do is declare a nonstatic scale in RootView and cast it as static in StepInfoView.  Thats not exactly possible...p  pCan ya help me outp

Negative 820 pI am currently researching if CQRS can be applied when building a particular system and have some questions I cannot easily find answers for.p  pIn CQRS commands are used to respond to user actions. Users select the actions they want via UI and UI layer knows which commands will handle them.p  pHowever sometimes commands are not valid based on the context, such as user role, entity business state public, archived and users relationship with the entity for example, a ticket has reporter and person assigned.p  pCommands can check this as a part of overall validation. Obviously if the command is not valid for particular entity state it should not make any changes, therefore the validation and changes should be wrapped in a transaction if applicable.p  pThis is all good and necessary, but we need to know if the command is valid within UI layer for the context, we dont care about full validation here so the appropriate UI element like button or menu item will simply be omitted if its not applicable. Therefore it seems to me that the read model for detailsupdate views should return list of valid commands. Also if there is a read model that lists entities similar security trimming is needed here too, using the same rules and code.p  pAs a bonus, some entities have state that is dependent on time, therefore it cannot be stored in the model but must be determined at runtime by using current server time.  p  pThe fact that read model cannot store such information is also apparent because it cannot be known without a context.p  pAs I see to handle this in a user friendly and clean manner without violating DRY so as not to duplicate business logic we have to bend CQRS here a bit by appending additional query conditions based on context and business state checking and add list of valid commands within read models, therefore these system aspects become less separated and emthe process of returning read models involves command handlerem.p  pPerhaps I am worrying here too much and security trimming can be allowed to violate CQRS principles by being crosscutting concernp

Negative 820 pIve been working on this for hours and having alot of difficulty been unable to find a solution.p  pI have two divs. div3 must change its contents accordingly whenever div2 changes. Div2 is changed via ajax, thus when this happens it must trigger another ajax call to change div3 as well.p  pbHere are the detailsbp  ol liI have main.html, which contains several different clickable buttons. Onclick, each of these buttons will trigger an ajax function to load, which outputs a php file in div2.li lipThis php script outputs the results of a database query, which are different depending on which button in main.html was clicked.pli lipI have a div div3, which is supposed to display the contents of a subsection of data of the current  div 3 output.pli lipThus it logically follows that whenever div2 changes, div3 contents must change accordingly.pli lipInitially i thought i could just put the function call to the second ajax function at the end of the php file, that way it would always load right after the php file, but apparently java cannot be read from within an ajax output.pli ol  pbHeres what ive triedbp  ol liTried putting a function call in javascript codeltscriptgtcode tags at the end of the php file, but didnt work for above mentioned reasons.li liI tried to call the function as an codeonloadcode event of the last div of the php file, but it doesnt work. li liI tried to add codeonchangecode to the div2 element so that whenever the contents is changed via ajax the second ajax script runs, but it didnt work.li liI tried to call my second ajax function from the very end of the first ajax function, but that prevented my first function from working properly.li liStrangely enough, if i attach the function to an codeonclickcode event in the php file, and click on it from div2 when the php has loaded, it works, and updates div3 contents.li ol  pAll i need to do is find a way to turn that codeonclickcode function call into something automatic whenever  either the php page loads, or when div2 contents change. p  pbAdditional notesb 1. Id like to stay away from codeevalcode if i can, because i tried to learn it but the methodology of developing an appropriate regex and all the other details seemed very complicated to me. It might take me hours to develop an appropriate approach and even then might not work....Id prefer to stick with all the possible simple options ive overlooked or might not have implemented properly. 2.

Negative 820 pIve a perl module which needs to run within both Win32 and Linux OSes. This module employs Win32ProcessList to avoid concurrency issues with a 3rd party application under Win32, and has no equivalent requirement when run under Linux.p  pSo far, Ive managed to have two copies of the same module, with Win32specific stuff commented out for the Linux version  and Im obviously not happy with this errorprone approach.p  pIt is clear that winspecific stuff does not make install in Linux.

Negative 820 pI am currently about to build a website for a client. For static content I am going to use middleman. The website consists of a series of categories and inside each there are several products with their own html page. For example cars.html has a series of links inside of it that go to corolla.html or accord.htmlp  pI was planning on building the site using only middleman, and generating an html page for every product item inside a yaml file. Doing it this way could really speed up development since products are not added regularly, almost all products are going to be added at once, but this means no database is being used.p  pThe issue I am having is that the site needs to have a search box not Google Search so that users can quickly jump to the relevant page, but without a proper database I am not sure if this can be done.  What tools could I use to archieve this p  pI have been looking at alternatives such as Ruby on Rails or Wordpress but I feel it might be overkill. Any help is greatly appreciated Thanks, Nickp

Negative 820 pIm trying to understand how QEMU handles interrupts for ARM processors. I have a bare metal  binary blob ie, not linux  just some assembly code which was built for a ARM1176. When run in QEMU, during initialisation the code in the binary blob sets bit 13 of the CPSR indicating that the interrupt vector table is located at code0xFFFF0000code. Hooking up GDB and dumping the instructions at that address, I can indeed see the corresponding interrupt vector table. On an IRQ, it jumps to code0xFFFF0018code, which just does a jump to code0xFFFF00070code, which has the code for the first irqhandler, and ultimately jumps to a second irqhandler.p  pThats fine, but when I look at hooking up interrupts in QEMU every reference I find is hooking up my own irqhandler. If you allocate an irq, I need to provide a codeqemuirqhandlercode that gets called when the IRQ is fired. But in this case, I dont want my own handler to get called. I was assuming that QEMU would emulate the ARM processor and jump to code0xFFFF0018code when I, for instance, called codeqemusetirqcode and start running the code there.p  pIm sure something is lacking in my understanding, but is there not some way to get QEMU to jump to the interrupt vector table and run the code there when triggering an interrupt, for example, with codeqemusetirqcodep
Negative 820 pAlright, Im working on one project which involves html5 audio, in addition to that a video is shown while audio is playing Just video, no controls etc. Video is a visualisation sometimes called equaliser of audio that is playing, made beforehand in adobe after effects. both files video and audio are same length e.g. 3 min 20 sec. I need a way to synchronise both, as video might load slower than audio or vice versa. Therefore I need to make it so that on computers with slow internet connection if video stops loading at some point and starts buffering I need to pause audio, and once video resumes start audio again, both at exactly same time, also when user skips to a certain bit in a song, video should skip to that bit as well, Ill use custom api made player for video so there would be no controls on video, only on soundcloud player. It is almost as if I was using soundcloud custom player to control video. Im struggling to find any resources on this anywhere, and would really like to know how to achieve this functionality. javascript or jQuery solutions are preferable.p  pWhat makes it even more complicated is that I use SoundClouds custom player to play songs a hrefhttpdevelopers.soundcloud.comdocscustomplayer relnofollowhttpdevelopers.soundcloud.comdocscustomplayerap  pAnd upload videos to VimeoYouTube all done to decrease load on a websitep

Negative 820 pIve been trying to figure out the best way to use Rails, Ember 1.0RC and jQuery mobile but with no success.p  pIm building a simple single web app with Rails as a backend that provides simple JSON. Now I know that Ember and JQM dont like each other and you have to write custom helpers to render Ember views. This makes things quite complicated.p  pI know that there are a few examples out there but they are quite obsolete since Ember was under heavy development and there have been many changes.p  pId like to hear from experienced developers if it is a good idea or not to use Ember with JQM in my casep  pMaybe I should go for other MVC framework which onep  pSorry for the question being pretty open but I could not find any reliable resources on the web.p  p edited on March 20p  pIve watched 2 Ember screencasts from Peepscode and Railscasts and they shed some light on the matter. Now I know a little bit more. But let me explain what Im after.p  pIm building an internal kudos app based on the merits system. That is every Monday an employee receives 20 kudos to give other coworkers. The design is as follows the main page shows a list of all employees and at the top, also as an list item, there is position that belongs to himself. It shows for example how many kudos to give left and how many he or she received from others. The owner do not know how many kudos other employees received. But I think therell be a Top 3 kudoers page.p  pWhen you taphold an item, a modal dialog will appear that will ask you if you what to give a kudo.p  pIt is done. But what remained is porting it to Ember.p  pNow, after watching screencasts I kind of know what to do, but what buggs me is how to make JQM internal hash pages and Ember router a breeze.p  pI saw that one page app in Ember uses urls like these myappusersuserp  pwhereas JQM uses internal pages like this myappsomepagep  pId like to keep the app as simple as possible following Ember convention over configuration and make use of JQM internal pages.p  pSo my question is how can they both go with each otherp
Negative 820 pIm trying to send data from the clients side to the servers side using TCP socket programming. p  pWhat I did is I read in the file names in the clients directory and then send the file name to the servers side by sending codeclientSocket.sendFILE fileToTransfer  ncode. Then on the servers side, I use regex to get the file name out. p  pHowever, the client will always send the FILE fileName.txt and the files contents together. So I suppose at the servers side, I will have to use regex to separate the file name with the files contents. p  pSo what I did at the servers side is to use codegetFileName  re.matchrFILE .n.,datacode to get the file name and its contents separately. Unfortunately, code.code does not include line breaks. p  pIn that case, how do I separate the file contents with the file name Is there a way to get the clients side to send the file name first then wait for servers side to get the file name before the file contents can be sent over Or is there a regex which I can use so that I can separate the file name and the file contentsp

Negative 820 pI would appreciate any assistance with techniques strategies to implement the scenario belowbr 1. SQL Database has a Customer table with some fields. 2. User is allowed to add additional custom fields and specify the data type and some rules such as value is required etc.  3. When the user loads the user interface, these custom fields need to appear as any other standard field with validation on the field.  4. When the user saves the changes, the values in these custom fields need to be saved to the databasep  pTechnology br We are still in the design phase  so open to all suggestions.

Negative 820 pI am new to C but have worked extensively with C. I have a C function that needs to be called from C. After reading some answers from SO and some googling, I conclude that I need to make a pure C interface to the function. I have done this, but am still confused about how to call it from C. p  pThe function in C looks like thisp  precodeint processImages     stdstringamp inputFilePath,                       An input file     const stdvectorltstdstringgtamp inputListOfDirs,  Input list of dirs     stdvectorltInternalStructgtamp vecInternalStruct,   InputOutput struct     stdvectorltstdvectorlt int gt gtamp OutputIntsForEachFile,     stdvectorlt stdvectorltSmallStructgt gtamp vecVecSmallStruct,  Output     int verboseLevel      codepre  pThe same function, converted in C, looks like thisp  precodeint processImagesC     char pinputFilePath,                An input file     char pinputListOfDirs,             Input list of dirs     sizet pnumInputDirs,               Indicating number of elements     InternalStruct pvecInternalStruct,  InputOutput struct     sizet pnumInternalStructs,      int pOutputIntsForEachFile,        a 2d array each row ending with 1     sizet pnumOutputIntsForEachFile one number indicating its number of rows     SmallStruct pvecVecSmallStruct,    Output     sizet pnumInVecSmallStruct,     int verboseLevel      codepre  pThis is based on a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2179270passcsharpstringtocandpasscresultstringcharwhatevertocsthisa advice. p  pNow I need to call this from C, which is where the confusion is. I have tried my best to convert the structures. p  pThe C code looks like thisp  precode[DllImport     Cpathtocppdll.dll, CallingConventionCallingConvention.Cdecl,      EntryPointprocessImagesC, SetLastErrortrue] [return MarshalAsUnmanagedType.I4] unsafe public static extern int processImagesC     String inputFilePath,     String[] inputListOfDirs,     ref uint numInputListOfDirs,       Should I use ref InternalStruct  vecInternalStruct     ref InternalStruct[] vecInternalStruct,       ref uint numInternalStruct,       Or ref int[] or ref int[][] or int[][]     ref int[][] OutputIntsForEachFile,       ref uint numOutputIntsForEachFile,       again, ref ..[], [][], or ref [][]     ref SmallStruct[][] vecVecSmallStruct,       int verboseLevel  codepre  pThere are memory allocations for all the output variables pointers done within the CC code. This likely means we need to declare the code as unsafe, correctp  pHow do we handle memory deallocation Should I write another API function that does the deallocation of objectsarrays allocated by CCp  pThe C code needs to be standard compliant and platform independent, so I cannot insert any windowsspecific things in it. p  pI hope someone could make sense of this and provide an answer or at least point me in the right direction. p

Negative 820 pHi could someone please help I am using matlab to generate a disparity map. I have performed multiwavelet transforms on two rectified stereo pairs and have used a stereo matching algorithm to combine the corresponding babsebands from each image to produce four intial disparity maps. However, I am now stuck and completely clueless on how to use a median operator to combine the values of these four disparity maps into one. Could someone please help mep  pthe four of my images are equal in size. The previous code is irrelevant since it is in a different fileI have just saved the output from the previous file and now I am trying to code this in another file.p  pMy thoughts were to 1.  Read the value of pixel p from each of the four basebands  2.  Sort the values into ascending order 3.  Calculate the median value of the pixel 4.  Write the pixel value to a new image 5.  Set p1 and repeat steps 14 until last pixel is reachedp  pThank youp

Negative 820 pI have an issue that Ive been scratching my head at Ive looked into the codeIndexMatchcode lookup method, and codeVHLookupcode, but Im not sure these will help just yet. Heres whats happeningp  pI have two worksheets in a hrefquestionstaggedexcel2007 classposttag titleshow questions tagged excel2007 reltagexcel2007a. One has a Customer ID column which does and will have duplicate IDs in the instance that the customer did x activity more than one time in a month and then the date that this happened in another column. The second sheet is for giving an overview of a specific day, IE what happened on 7113.p  pThe issue is that my raw data sheet is sorted via the first of the month descending, so 71,72,etc, and when I run the codeVlookupcode, if a Customer ID has a record on 72 and on 715, the codeVLookupcode will pull data only from the 72 first row. Has anyone experienced this and found a workaroundp  pMy current workaround would be to make either a new table for each days data, or instead of using my codeVLookupcode of codeVlookupA2, Data Sheet AD, 4, 0code to give the columns row numbers, like codeVlookupA2, Data Sheet A1D30, 4, 0code. This is a daily report, and that would be intense. Please help if you canp  pAnother side note, I have one main sheet for the view, one data sheet where its all collected, and then 30 sheets, one for each day of the month, this case being July. For each sheet, Ive named them the day of the month, so Im reflecting the data as suchp  pSheets7113 has data from the 1st on it. The Data Sheet in its entireity has data from 7113 to 73113. I need to reference IDs on the 1st to the data for the 1st and the 1st only.p  pI want to use something like this, but Im having a hard time with itp  precodeVlookupA2, Data Sheet, AD ONLY IF THE CREATE DATE OF THIS ITEM IS 71, 4,0 codepre  pbut of course its not that easy pp

Negative 820 pI have a webservice that either adds or updates room inventory based on whether it is available or not. Code below. The problem I am having with this code is that it will either do a add or an update for the entire range or throw an error like for example if I am changing inventory for the period 1882013 to 2582013 and 188238 has no inventory but 248258 has, an error is thrown for 248 saying inventory is available and insert is not possible halting the entire process. I want my code to be able to add or update the entire date range rather then just doing an add or amend of everything. Is that possible Do I need to change my code for that How do I do that Would be grateful for any insight on where I have gone wrong or how to change my code to be able to do this.

Negative 820 pI am trying to read a fixed width text file and store each element to a class object.  Each row in the text file needs to be checked for which parsing action must be performed.  Rows 1000 and 1001 each need to be parsed differently and rows 10021004 use the same parsing action.  I am reading the file and parsing correctly, but when I add elements to the class object the object gets overwritten in each if statement.

Negative 820 pI have a legacy project which I have been approved to work in a codeknockout.jscode module.  This is great however the application is extremely complex and I need to use some of the prebuilt form validation of our application.  My form validators work fine until a dynamic template gets switched out.  I cant for the life of me figure out the error.  Nothing in the console and my vast debugging efforts have been fruitless.  Im thinking that my solution could be something along the lines of limiting the scope of the knockout application similar to how one can declare codengappcode in codeangular.jscode.  I cant find a working example of how to do this or any documentation relevant to codeknockout.jscodep  pAny help or suggestion is appreciated.  Thank you ladies and gentlemen.p

Negative 820 pLike many people, my brain tends to work well with visual aka nontextual information for reading, writing, and creating.p  pWhat are some tools that in some way allow me to see my currentlyrunning javascript environment visuallyp  pOne obvious example would be to just put one box on the screen or an HTML page to represent each object that is currently inmemory. The box might contain a label which is the variable currently bound to the object. If Im using a pubsub library, the box might flash momentarily when the object it represents gets a message that it is subscribed to. Clicking on the box might give me a list of all the public methods for that object, and if the code has method signature annotations, I would see the names of its parameters.p  pAnything somewhat similar to this that is in Javascript and works on a currentlyrunning process is welcome Also, it must be in the form of a javscript library that I can tack onto existing code, but examples of this kind of tool as found in some IDE or browser plugin as an illustration are welcome.p

Where is the build agent service According to this article, Im supposed to have two different user accounts a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryvstudioms253149.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryvstudioms253149.aspxap  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comFrBzC.jpg altenter image description herep
Negative 820 pI came across a problem while using coderChartscode in my codeShinycode application. I generate dynamically 13 codetabPanelscode depending on the user selection and in each of them one plot is rendered. Plot may be of two types simple with emgraphicsem libary or rCharts with strongemmorrisem librarystrong. The whole codetabsetPanelcode is rendered within the codeuiOutputcode component, each time an user changes his input. The type of the codeui outputcode codeplotOutputcode for simple plot or codeshowOutputcode for rCharts is defined when a codetabPanelcode is rendered, so the plot strongdoesstrong have a emproperem environment. p  pAnd the strongproblemstrong simple plots with graphics, ggplot2 etc. do work OK  they are displayed correctly in a codetabPanelcode. However, when I work with application and have 2 or 3 rCharts to be displayed, it happens that strongone chart is not displayingstrong  almost at all see the images below. Of course, such a problem does not appear with simple plots. p  pI tried to have the output size fixed, size flexible, but the problem still exists.

Negative 820 pI have come across an oddity where my pivot table misses out a Grand Total count on a text field, when it is used alongside a Min or Max value for another field.

In the bottom right of the pivot table, the codeTotal Max of Vcode shows correctly as code0code but the codeTotal Count of IDcode shows as blank.  p  pInterestingly, this does not seem to happen if the counted value is numeric. To demonstrate, go back to Sheet1, replace the values codeA1code to codeA6code with numbers code1code to code6code go to the pivot table sheet and refresh the pivot table codeTotal Count of IDcode now shows correctly as code6code.  p  pIn my real case, my data source is a data connection to SQL Server, and my counted values are text.  p  pExcel About shows Excel 2007 12.0.6550.5004 SP2 MSO 12.0.6554.5001  I cannot update in my corporate environment.p

Negative 820 pI am working with a framework that uses a hrefhttpapi.jquery.comcategorydeferredobject relnofollowjQuery Deferred Objectsa.p  pIn my code, one async operation should executed successfully so that another async operation be executed.p  precodefunction doOperation       var def2mock  .Deferred     var def1  doSomeAsyncOperation.donefunction           var def2  doAnotherAsyncOperation          return .whendef1, def2mock  codepre  pSo I put the call for the second operation in the done promise of the deferred of the first operation as in the example. Now, I wrap this sequence with the function codedoOperationcode. The result of codedoOperationcode should be the join of the two deferreds of both async calls. Meaning codedoOperationcode succeeds if all async operations succeed and fails if any of them fail, which is exactly what a hrefhttpapi.jquery.comjQuery.when relnofollowcode.whencodea does.p  pstrongThe problemstrong is that in order to create the join with code.whencode, I need both deferreds present at the time code.whencode is called. And because the deferred of the second async operation is not available at that moment, I had to find a way to create the join first, then add the deferred of the second async operation to the join emlaterem.p  pTo do this, I thought I can define a new emmockem code.Deferredcode named codedef2code in codedoOperationcode. And when the real codedef2code is ready, I can somehow emlinkem the real deferred to the mock one, i.e. make the real one synchronize its state with mock one. The only way I found was to dop  precodedef2.donedef2mock.resolve  and  def2.faildef2mock.reject codepre  pbut I dont feel this manual linking is the right way to do it.p  pSo please tell me if you have a better suggestion on how to do it the right way.p

Negative 820 pAfter reading the documentation, testing and reading a lot of other questions here on stackoverflowp  pWe have documents that have titles and description in multiple languages. There are also tags that are translated to the same languages. There might be up to 3040 different languages in the system, but probably only 3 or 4 translations for a single document.p  pThis is the planned document structure p  precode  luck      id 10018,     pub 0,     pr 100002,     loc        lat 42.7,       lon 84.2     ,     t [            lang enanalyzer,     title Forest,     desc A lot of trees.,     tags [       Wood,       Nature,       Green Mouvement     ]       ,            lang franalyzer,     title Fort,     desc A grand nombre darbre.,     tags [       Bois,       Nature,       Mouvement Vert     ]            ],     dates [       20140101T2000,       20140606T2000,       20140808T2000     ]     codepre  pPossible queries are arbre or wood or forest or nature combined with a date and a geodistance filter, furthermore there will be some facets over the tags array that obviously include counting.p  pWe can produce any document structure that fits best for elasticsearch or for lucene. Its crucial that each language is analyzed specifically, so we use analyzer in order to distinguish the languages. p  precode   luck      properties        id      type long       ,       pub      type long       ,       pr      type long       ,       loc      type geopoint       ,       t      analyzer        path t.lang     ,     properties        lang          type string       ,     properties        title          type string       ,       desc          type string       ,       tags          type string                             codepre  pA Apparently, this idea does not work after PUTting the mapping, we retrieve the same mapping GET and it seems to ignore the specific analyzers A test with a toplevel analyzer worked fine. Does analyzer work for subdocuments and if yes how to should we refer to it We also tested declaring the subdocument as object or nested. How is multilanguage document indexing supposed to work.p  pB One possibility would be to put each language in its own document In that case how do we manage the id Finally both documents should refer to the same id. For example if the user searches for nature and we dont know if the user intends to find nature in English or French, this document would appear twice in the result set, and the counting and paging would be very wrong also facet counting.p  pAny ideasp

However, I currently loop through only the four directories, so I expect I wouldnt be able to increment a progress bar with any higher resolution than 25 per tick. I am wondering if theres a way I might change it so that I can include a progress bar to monitor it, and have it be a little more accurate Furthermore, Im not sure if this should be asked in a different thread or not, but this method of file copying takes a very long time. It takes hours to copy 500MB worth of files, and I was wondering if there might be a way to speed it up That part isnt a priority though. Right now Im mainly interested in adding in a progress bar. Cheersp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pAfter some fiddling I realized I could probably use code similar to this This exact code may or may not workI just jotted it down quickly so I wouldnt forget it, it is still untested.

The question now is about a SwingWorker, which I believe Ill need in order to run the longterm methods in the background.

Negative 820 pWhen are codeconstexprcode objects constructed relative to noncodeconstexprcode nonlocal objects with static storage duration Do they start their life prior to initialization of any other objects, i.e., prior to dynamic initializationp  pIm contemplating whether it would be reasonable to have a a hrefhttpideone.comVs1VChcodestringliteralcode class live examplea which is used, e.g., to compare codestdstringcodes against certain keywordsp  precodeclass stringliteral       private members public     constexpr stringliteralchar const b     bool operator stdstring constamp other const     bool operator stdstring constamp other const      other member functions   constexpr stringliteral hellohello void fstdstring constamp s      if s  hello           do something       codepre  pSince the codestringliteralcode could parse the stringliteral at compiletime to locate the first nullcharacter, I could imagine that these comparisons can be made faster than comparing a codestdstringcode against a stringliteral. However, to be safe it is necessary that the codehellocode object is readily constructed when the first constructor is executed at runtime during static initialization otherwise these objects could be accidentally accessed when they are not, yet, constructed.p

Negative 820 pI have written a SoapServer program, and am trying to test it.

I am using SoapUI, have loaded the WSDL, and am trying to reach the SoapServer program.  According to SoapUI, the response I keep getting is an HTML file that is the UI for the PHP program that has started the SoapServer.p  pI am guessing that the WSDL should provide an actual URL for the soapaddress and that it should be overridden during testing with the options array, but I cant seem to find a combination that works.p  pMany of the examples I have found have extended addresses like a hrefhttpmyserver.comwissoapCBServer relnofollowhttpmyserver.comwissoapCBServera, without explaining where these came from.

Negative 820 pIm working in Silverlight, but potentially a WPF solution would work as well.p  pMy problem is very simple. I have lots of modal Child Windows that can be open, and in their generic menu is a home button. This button is supposed to close all of the child windows and return to the base screen. I have a few different types of generic child windows that host lots of different UserControls, so by far the easiest way to implement this is to, when the window comes into focus, check if the global codeReturnToHomecode bool is true, and if it is, just close it.p  pIve tried all of thesep  precode    private void ChildWindowGotFocusobject sender, RoutedEventArgs e              if CommonResources.ReturnToHome DialogResult  false           private void ChildWindowMouseEnterobject sender, MouseEventArgs e              if CommonResources.ReturnToHome DialogResult  false           private void ChildWindowIsEnabledChangedobject sender, DependencyPropertyChangedEventArgs e              if CommonResources.ReturnToHome DialogResult  false      codepre  pThe issue is, codeGotFocuscode doesnt fire until I actually click on the window. codeMouseEntercode is a little better, but doesnt fire until I move the mouse. codeIsEnabledChangedcode never fires because the Child Window doesnt disable anything. Checking every child window when it closes to see if Home has been clicked isnt easy because of the sheer number of places where you can open child windows, and several of them are nested within User Controls where I couldnt even easily access codeDialogResultcode. Any idea how I could do thisp  pAlso I should note that I want each of the windows to close one by one, from top down, because each window that closes does its own verification to see if it should warn the user before closing giving the user the option to cancel closingp

Negative 820 pI have a lot of rows in my gridview which are filled manually. However some columns have always the same value. So instead of manually entering the same data over and over again, I want to add a data to the top of the column, and when a button is clicked, I want all the column cells to be filled with the same value. I am looking for ways to do it at the moment but couldnt find an easy way at the moment. p  pEdit Until now I added an image button to the header row [0], and when clicked the image button clicked event fires. I can get the cell in row [0] but not in row[1], because I dont know how to find the column identity. If I will be able to reach cell value of this specific column, then I will copy it to the rest of the column p

Negative 820 pI am trying to make a proxy in Python that allows the user to route all of their web traffic through a host machine this is mainly for me and a couple people I know to confuseavoid hackers andor spies, who would only see web pages and so on coming in through one IP. I have run into several difficulties. The first is that I would like to be able to use the final, compiled product with Firefox, which can be set to route all of its traffic through an installed proxy program. I dont know what kind of configuration my proxy needs to have to do this. Second, the way the proxy works is by using codeurllib.requests.urlretrievecode yes, going to die soon, but I like it to download a webpage onto the host computer its inefficient and slow, but its only going to be used for a max of 710 clients and then sending the file to the client. However, this results in things like missing pictures or broken submission forms. What should I be using to get the webpages right I want things like SSL and video streaming to work as well as pictures and whatnot.p

Negative 820 pLibraries like a hrefhttpsgithub.comrsSDWebImage relnofollowSDWebImagea and a hrefhttpsgithub.comAFNetworkingAFNetworking relnofollowAFNetworkinga add the ability to set the codeimagecode on a codeUIImageViewcode based on a  URL which loads asynchronously, thus not making the user wait while the image loads.p  pFor my use, Im creating a gallery similar to Photos.app but the images are loaded from URLs. In case the gallery has say, 50 high resolution images I dont want the user to have to wait for every single one to load before they can view even the first, so these libraries are perfect for my use case Ill load the first image then load on demand.p  pHowever, Im confused as to how to show the images in the view when their frame is not yet known as the image has yet to be downloaded. This would be a nonissue if every one had the same frame if they were avatars, for example, but this is not the case.p  pIn my case, I use UIImageViews as followsp  precode Create image view self.imageView  [[UIImageView alloc] initWithImageimage] self.imageView.userInteractionEnabled  YES   Create scroll view self.scrollView  [[UIScrollView alloc] initWithFrameself.view.frame] self.scrollView.delegate  self self.scrollView.contentSize  self.imageView.bounds.size self.scrollView.showsHorizontalScrollIndicator  NO self.scrollView.showsVerticalScrollIndicator  NO self.scrollView.decelerationRate  UIScrollViewDecelerationRateFast   Figure out the zoom extremities, as well as the initial zoom level so full image is visible CGFloat scrollViewWidthRatio  CGRectGetWidthself.scrollView.bounds  self.scrollView.contentSize.width CGFloat scrollViewHeightRatio  CGRectGetHeightself.scrollView.bounds  self.scrollView.contentSize.height CGFloat minScale  MINscrollViewWidthRatio, scrollViewHeightRatio self.scrollView.minimumZoomScale  minScale self.scrollView.zoomScale  minScale self.scrollView.maximumZoomScale  1.0   Add image view and scroll view [self.scrollView addSubviewself.imageView] [self.view addSubviewself.scrollView] codepre  pHowever this all seems to break when the images load asynchronously. What do I set the frame to as the image could be any of a million different sizes What do I set the codescrollView.contentSizecode to due to the same issue How do I calculate the scrollViews zoom scalesp  pBasically, how do I employ any concept of a frame or sizing when I dont know it yet Is there a way to refresh all this when the image is loadedp
Negative 820 pI would like to generate all permutations of the ordered pairs a, b where a  b, and a, b are elements of set S lets say S  1..k, but excluding permutations of the individual elements of S.p  pFor example, setting k  2, the possible ordered pairs are 1, 2, 2, 1 giving 2 possible sequencesp  ul li1, 2, 2, 1 li li2, 1, 1, 2li ul  pbut which are actually duplicates under the permutation mapping of 12, 21.p  pFor k  3, there would be 6 possible ordered pairs, giving 6 sequences including duplicates. But with 3  k possible permutations, the desired number of unique sequences is 5, and is easily generated by only taking sequences that begin with the pair 1, 2.p  pIn the general case, there would be kk1 pairs, giving [k  k1] sequences including duplicates, and there would be k permutations, so I should end up with [k  k1]  k sequences.p  pI only intend to use small values of k, but am wondering if there are any good ways of generating these sequences. Im fairly certain this is a specific case of filtering out unique sequences [allowing duplicate elements] subject to permutations of the possible elements in those sequences, but maybe theres something particular about what Im looking for that is easier than the bruteforce approach of generating all possible sequences and then filtering.p

Negative 820 pI am developing one Rich Text Box using JavaScript.By reading some excellent reference in Mozilla I have developed content editable div to make text Bold , Italic, Underline and some more fundamental effects. But When I apply the effect to my whole text and after that I am not able to put cursorcarat out side of the tag. Like when I type something my Div contenteditable  true becomes editable. And I type ABC. Then I select ABC and I press the Bold Button. And I got Bold text but after that I am not able to type in my div without BOLD tag. Can some one give me the solution. By Observing following code and output I hope I will clear my question.

Negative 820 pIm facing an odd problem with my web application. p  pLet me explain my application setup   The application is made with asp .net mvc 3 hosted in IIS 7.x .I use Spring .NET for instantiating my controllers, business layer and repositories. The repository uses NHibernate 3.3. The NHibernate session factory is created once per application controlled with Spring .NET. A new session is created and bound to a context per request in Global.asax begin request. The session is unbound from the session context in End request. Obviously, there are checks to ensure that this is done only for a valid action method and not every request. p  pThe business layer is injected with repository classes and a custom wrapper around an NHibernate ISession. Functions inside this class perform necessary DB operations. The createupdatedelete actions are always inside an NHibernate transaction. This has worked out well for the past few months of this application.p  pI was marking my business layer classes as singletonfalse in Spring .NET XML configuration. This meant that for each request, a new controller instance and a new instance of the business layer and its dependencies would be created. After doing some performance profiling, Ive found that this was a fairly expensive operation in terms of CPU cycles. So, I switched to marking my business layer classes to singletontrue. This brought down the CPU cycles needed to recreate business layer objects via the MVC3 GetService call. p  pemstrongThe problem emstrong after changing the business layer class to singletons, DB updates are no longer committed. codeCreate actions are persisted to the DB. But not updates.code I took a look at the NHibernate session activity via NHProfiler and what I see this p  pfor a create operationp  precodebegin transaction select  from tablex insert into table tabley ....  commit end transaction codepre  pfor an update operationp  precodebegin transaction end transaction codepre  pAnd thats it, just a begin and end transaction. The contents of the transaction are never flushed. NHibernate entities in memory for that session are updated. The ISession.WasCommitted propery returns true.. everything reads fine, the session is bound to a context for that request and then unbound for that request, everything else happens normally. Interestingly, strongif theres an insert operation, that is flushed to the DB but only the insertstrong. However, that operation doesnt show in NHProfiler when an update also happens. p  pIf I toggle the singleton property in the Spring .NET context config XML for that business layer object back to false, everything works normally. All CRUD operations continue as before. p  pSo, what could I be doing wrong Any helpsuggestions would be appreciated. p  pThanksp

However if it has multiple projects that depend on each otherno circular dependencies then I have to go through the quit and reopen sequence for as many times as there are projects minus one since the first one always seems to build.p
Negative 820 pI know how to test upon page load or refresh if JS is enabled, but it is possible to do this at every reflowp  pSay a page loads while JS is enabled, but during the browser session it is disabled, after which point any JS dependent actions performed by the user will fail. After testing I found for example that Chrome needed a refresh before these changes took effect while Firefox applied them instantly  so the site that originally worked fine broke when JS was disabled and no fallbacks that come into effect at page load were initiated.p  pSome may call this a trivial issue, and I am sure there are fallbacks that could solve this issue, but is it possible to test the state of the page at every reflowp  pAny further ideassuggestionsfallback examples welcome.

Negative 820 pI have some square table cells arranged in 5x5 matrix that change size depending on the resolution of the screen and depending on the orientation. Their height and width could be as low as 76px and as high as 182px  I think this range could be different depending on screen it is shown on.p  pHeres the problem. I am putting country names inside these boxes and they could be short 5 letter words such as Italy or they could be long names such as Afganisthan. Is there a way, using JQuery since that is what I am using to determine the screen size to alter the font size so that the word makes full use of the space available Country names could be made of multiple words such as Antigua and Barbuda. In this case I only care about the longest word in the name since it is OK to wrap the text. I already have a function in the C code behind that detects the longest word in the string, but I dont know how to use that information to affect the JQuery function that would resize the text.p  pIt is important that the code is client side since the user might decide to rotate their device and I would like the text resizing to occur without sending a server request.p  pThanksp

Negative 820 pIm working with push notifications. I read through Apples programming guide that in case of Remote or Local notifications, applicationdidFinishLaunchingWithOptions is called and hold the payload in the launchOptions. From there in case of notifications I can respond to the push. Im testing push on two devices. One that issues the push and the second receives it. I ran the app on both devices and i kept one turned on and the second exited the app to home screen and closed the phone to wait for a notification i didnt close the app on xcode though. I issues a push and i received it on the receiver device, however using NSLog, it seems that applicationdidFinishLaunchWithOptions is not being called when the push is opened and only once at application first start. I didnt provide code because there no much added to test that other than the push which is working fine. What could be wrong is that the right way to respond to notifications opened when the app is in the backgroundp

Negative 820 pIm running some task on Linux which produces certain CSVs. Once theyre produced, I need to copy them into different sheets of an excel file and then run some VBA macros to generate a report. Since this has to be done multiple times a day with no predefinedfixed schedule, Id like to automate it.p  pHere is what I tried I wrote a VBScript, which takes the CSV files and other required input files, opens an excel file, copies the CSVs into the excel, runs some VBA macros, and saves and closes the result. This VBScript works fine when triggered locally on a windows server. p  pI have uploaded a simpler version of the files involved a hrefhttpsdrive.google.comfiled0B4ugWarhx5tMNlpVbnhtZWZvbVkedituspsharing relnofollowherea which somewhat clarify my requirements Note that the macros I need to run are much more complicated 500 lines compared with the macros here. There are four files inside the archivep  ol liTemplate.xlsm The Excel template of the report into which data is to be pastedli liInputSheet2.csv  The input data to be pasted into the template into sheet 2li liInputSheet3.csv  The input data to be pasted into the template into sheet 3li liRun.vbs The vbscript which triggers the copypaste macro present inside the Excel template.li ol  pThe command to run the VBScript is cscript Nologo Run.vbs NoCancelp  pNow, in order to automate whole task, I thought to trigger this VBScript remotely from Linux over ssh. I installed the cygwin ssh daemon on the windows box and facilitated ssh connections from the Linux machine. This cygwin ssh connection from Linux allows to run several windows commands, but fails to run the VBScript and doesnt produce any excel output.p  pI cant figure out which component has limitations. Is it cygwin ssh not facilitating execution of VBScript Is it VBScript not facilitating creation of files remotely Is it ssh client on Linux not allowing opening of excel in GUI format Or there is another way to automate this task from Linux.p  pThanks,p  pShubhamp

Negative 820 pLooks like I have a huge issue which is making me quite confused on how to fix it.p  pI am using 4.0.3.RELEASE of Spring and created an MVC rest application. Most of the configuration is done via Java config as wrote a class WebMVCConfig which extends WebMvcConfigurerAdapter.p  pI have a spring bean that loads a text mining system which has some heavy lists. In a standalone application, I just load it once and everything I need to process some text I just call the process sentence method out of it. The constructor for that loads all lists once and after that it is just a matter of calling that function. The process function sometimes takes about 10 seconds, but sometimes it takes a few milliseconds to run all depends on the data.p  pNow, putting it on a Spring MVC application is interesting. If I set the scope to session scope for that bean Scopevalue  WebApplicationContext.SCOPESESSION, proxyMode  ScopedProxyMode.TARGETCLASS it works just great, of course takes sometime to load on my rest application.p  pHowever, eventually it will run out of the memory as sessions are never killed right away.p  pIf I do it on request it will be the same issue.p  pIf I do it default application scope than I have an issue with concurrent usages of that bean. One user runs well, the other crashes.p  pI have no idea of what to do. Although session scope seems to be the correct answer to it as the state is preserved on each call. Not only the Bean is heavy but it can take 10 seconds sometimes to perform the analysis.p  pI have a Java Configuration class where I inject that bean into my Service Implementation class via Inject annotation. Wonder if the correct would be Autowire instead.p  pBasically I have my datamining Bean that is injected into my services bean via Inject. I had assigned the 2 beans to be Session beans.p  pWonder if I should assign the datamining Bean as session and the service bean as application and which method to use to wire that Datamining bean. Whether I use an Autowire annotation or something else to avoid the problems I am having.p  pAlso, what about ScopedProxyMode Which one should be used on this casep  pThe situation, again, is a Heavy Bean which can have a slow processing time 10 seconds.p  pThanks,p

Negative 820 pIm writing to get some information regarding JavaFX. I have designed an application using SceneBuilder that has a primary scene consisting of a few text fields and buttons used to browse for files. There is also a text area used for output once the program has been run. I have added change listeners within the initialize method of the Controller so that when the output text area is updated a log file gets modified. p  pInitially I tested this using the output text area to display the log file. I was able to get everything working correctly with it logging and displaying the log in this output text area once I select a view log menu item from the main File menu. I ran into an issue that didnt seem very cleanly solved where when I displayed the Log it wanted to also log that display. I couldnt think of a clean work around for this and decided I would rather have the log open in its own secondary popup scene.p  pOne of my issues is that if I place a change listener on the output text area inside the Controllers initialize method, when I try to view log it throws a null pointer exception and points me to the line where the change listener is added. But please note that although it throws this exception trying to open the log window the change listeners and output text area still work appropriately.p  pIf I remove the change listener the window opens fine  but nothing is updated within the logFileOutputTextArea. p  pController Filep  precodepublic class AppController implements Initializable      FXML     private TextArea logFileOutputTextArea       Override     public void initializeURL url, ResourceBundle rb                verifierOutputTextArea.textProperty.addListenernew ChangeListenerltStringgt                      Override             public void changedObservableValuelt extends Stringgt ov, String t, String t1                               IF we have a valid file                 if verifierOutputTextArea.textProperty.getValue.equalsValid                                    openOutputFolderButton.visibleProperty.setValueopenOutputFolderButton.visibleProperty                         .getValue                                                   verifierOutputTextArea.textProperty.addListenernew ChangeListenerltStringgt                      Override             public void changedObservableValuelt extends Stringgt ov, String t, String t1                              appendLogverifierOutputTextArea.textProperty.getValue     append the output to the log                                  Check for a preset input file location         checkDefaultInputDirectory        END INITIALIZE       FXML     private void openLog               try                      Stage dialogStage  new Stage              Parent root  FXMLLoader.loadgetClass.getResourcefxmllogwindow.fxml              Scene scene  new Sceneroot              dialogStage.setScenescene             dialogStage.setTitleLog             dialogStage.show                  catch IOException ioe                      ioe.printStackTrace                   Path logFilePath  Paths.getStaticTools.LOGFILELOCATION             IF the file doesnt exist         if Files.existslogFilePath                      this.logFileOutputTextArea.textProperty.setValueLog has not been created yet                  else                      try                              byte[] fileByteArray  Files.readAllByteslogFilePath                  this.logFileOutputTextArea.setTextStaticTools.cryptToolnew StringfileByteArray, Cipher.DECRYPTMODE                            catch IOException e                              e.printStackTrace                              END OPENLOG    END CONTROLLER codepre  pLog Window .fxmlp  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingUTF8gt  ltimport javafx.geometry.Insetsgt ltimport javafx.scene.control.Labelgt ltimport javafx.scene.control.TextAreagt ltimport javafx.scene.layout.gt ltAnchorPane xmlnsfxhttpjavafx.comfxml1 minHeightInfinity minWidthInfinity prefHeight304.0         prefWidth478.0 xmlnshttpjavafx.comjavafx8       fxcontrollerapplication.javafx.AppControllergt     ltchildrengt         ltGridPane layoutX14.0 layoutY22.0 prefHeight269.0 prefWidth446.0gt             ltcolumnConstraintsgt                 ltColumnConstraints hgrowSOMETIMES minWidth10.0 prefWidth100.0gt             ltcolumnConstraintsgt             ltrowConstraintsgt                 ltRowConstraints maxHeightInfinity minHeightInfinity prefHeight20.0 vgrowSOMETIMESgt                 ltRowConstraints vgrowSOMETIMESgt             ltrowConstraintsgt             ltchildrengt                 ltLabel textLog Filegt                     ltpaddinggt                         ltInsets bottom5.0gt                     ltpaddinggt                 ltLabelgt                 ltTextArea fxidlogFileOutputTextArea editablefalse prefHeight200.0 prefWidth200.0                           wrapTexttrue GridPane.rowIndex1gt             ltchildrengt         ltGridPanegt     ltchildrengt ltAnchorPanegt codepre  pDo I need a separate controller for each fxml file Why does placing initialize statements and change listeners into the initialize method cause issues Why after the output text area in the main scene has been modified, either by clearing the text or setting the text, does alttabbing to a different window throw codejava.lang.IllegalArgumentException argument type mismatchcode exceptions every timep  pThank you for your time  p

Negative 820 pRendezvous Hashing is an algorithm which solves the same problem as consistent hashingp  blockquote   p...an algorithm that allows clients to achieve distributed agreement   on which site or proxy a given object is to be placed in.p      hr      pRendezvous hashing has the following properties.p      ol   lipLow overhead The hash function used is efficient, so overhead at the clients is very low.pli   lipLoad balancing Since the hash function is randomizing, each of the n sites is equally likely to receive the object O. Loads are uniform   across the sites.pli   lipHigh hit rate Since all clients agree on placing an object O into the same site SO , each fetch or placement of O into SO yields the   maximum utility in terms of hit rate.

Negative 820 pThis is more sort of a logical question, everything is working fine. p  pI have an ImageView and for that I download images from the web server. Our web server keeps the biggest size image and then I am rescaling the images down for required devices. So lets say, if I have an UIImageView with size 200  200 and I am downloading image of 400  400, I rescale the image to 200  200 and then I put it in the imageview, I tried putting 400 by 400 image in 200 by 200 image view and it looks fine to me no pixelation. The way I implemented the downscaling isp  precode[image drawInRectCGRectMake0,0,newSize.width,newSize.height] codepre  pwithin the image context. Now I feel like apple might be doing this anyway because it is rescaling my image to fit in the image view, so is it really required Or should I just put high resolution images directly in the image view p  pSuggestions required. p

Negative 820 pI have two classes, AbstractProject and Project. AbstractProject is an abstract class, and is extended by Project.

My twig templates access the properties without complaint they come up blank, but dont complain about the property or method not existing, and I can use the inherited properties in the parent class, yet doctrine refuses to recognize them. Classes and mappings below, appreciate another set of eyes on it maybe Im missing something simple.p  pIf it helps, when I try to generate entities for dpProjectBundle where the AbstractProject lives I get an error Bundle dpProjectBundle does not contain any mapped entities.

Negative 820 pThe other night the oomkiller was summoned on a linux machine thats been running nicely for a while now because overall RAM usage went out of control at some point. The output of that in varlogmessages was a little surprising to me, in that it showed the rmiregistry process using almost 1G of memory. Our system is very simple and only binds only one object to the rmiregistry, which is just a collection of static methods. So that object itself uses almost no memory. On a normal system the size of that process is more like 30M, which still seems awfully high to me. Other than loading the classes serialized by the bound object, and maybe some representation of the bound object somehow, what is actually stored in the rmiregistry process Im using OpenJDK 1.6.033.p

It is a global pause that will pause any media player currently playing, whether it is in fore or background.p  pI even got SendKeys to work with win32ole and was able to correctly send CAPSLOCK, and set my keys to CAPSLOCK, but PAUSE didnt work, nor did STOP. a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryaa266279vvs.60.aspx relnofollowhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryaa266279vvs.60.aspxa.p  pThank you kind friendsp

Negative 820 pI am trying to detect an object in the frames received from camera on an android device, using OpenCV.p  pRight now I am stuck because of the lack of tutorials and examples.

Also a hrefhttpdocs.opencv.orgdoctutorialsintroductionandroidbinarypackagedevwithOCVonAndroid.html relnofollowHerea is the famous original tutorialp  pAnyway, how I see it, an app like this one should havep  ol liSome initialization part for the library, so OpenCV would be loaded when the app is startingli lionCameraFrame, I should do the object detecting, then if detected, I will Log the detection and move forward.li ol  pSo the test app runs just fine... My biggest problem so far is that on the display of my device I see an inverted image, not just filped but inverted, or maybe flipped horizontally and vertically, i cant really tell. But I do not request any flipping anywhere as far as I can see.

Now the image is no longer inverted.p  pBut now, the image is not occupying all the screen, but it is centered, just like it would be a square...p  pStill, how do I prevent, or make sure that my final app wont start with my image inverted Is there a reason this happened I read already somewhere that some manufacturers of tablets have some kind of hardware bug that makes the image from the camera inverted... but with me it only happens sometimes... So the tablet I am using might not be among those buggy devices its a Samsung Tab2 GTP3100. So, still... something is not right with this. It never happened to me to turn the default camera on to take a photo and to find the image inverted...p

That means redirects are not allowedfor certain URLs and I need either app to be able to respond to the same URLs that currently exist. Cant add in wp or anything like that. The URLs need to be identical.p  pSo for instance we currently have a page at a hrefhttpexample.compage.html relnofollowhttpexample.compage.htmla that is being generated by WordPress.  I would like to replace this with a page that is generated by silverstripe.p  pIs there a way to configure Apache or Nginx so that if the silverstripe app understands the request has a route defined for a hrefhttpexample.compage.html relnofollowhttpexample.compage.htmla it will be generated by silverstripe and if it doesnt understand the request it will fall back to WordPress and be served strongemfrom the same URLemstrong a hrefhttpexample.compage.html relnofollowhttpexample.compage.htmla by WordPress.  Not a hrefhttpexample.comwordpresspage.html relnofollowhttpexample.comwordpresspage.htmlap  pThanksp

Negative 820 pHello Stack Community.p  pI am doing work with network analytics and have a data reshaping question. p  pMy original data comes in as a series of columns each column being a source and target pair. The final data frame needs to be made up of two columns source and target. Note these pairs are staggered as they source and targets are linked as in a directed network. See the finaloutput in the code example for desired outputp  pI created a very hacky method producing the output I need see code below but it does not accommodate differing numbers of columns without me adding variables and whatnot. Also, please note in some cases the number of column pairs will be an odd number, i.e. one source with no target at the end of the data frame. In this case the missing target column is created with NAs.p  pI feel there is a smooth way to produce this without all the handwork. I have been searching and searching and have not come across anything.

Negative 820 pI am using Chrome to debug a complex web page written in javascript. When events of long duration occur, the web application puts up a gray wait shield on most of the currently displayed web page to lock the page and indicate to the user that no input is currently allowed. This wait shield is very similar to the gray page that the Chrome debugger puts up when it hits a break point. In fact, the chrome debuggers gray shield is making it very hard to debug my applications gray shield. Does anyone know if there is a way to tell the Chrome debugger to NOT display a gray shield when hitting break pointsp

Im using an a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidwidgetExpandableListView.html relnofollowcodeExpandableListViewcodea to group by album, artist or year depending on the users selection.  When the selection changes it automatically regroups the items.p  pWhat makes this more complicated is that the items are the result of a search which may still be in progress.  So there is a fairly strong coupling between the search thread class and the adaptor a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidwidgetBaseExpandableListAdapter.html relnofollowcodeBaseExpandableListAdaptercodea so that the search can dynamically pump data into the groups and generate new groups over a period of up to two minutes.  This all is working fine.p  pMy question is how do I switch to showing all tracks ungrouped.  There doesnt seem to be an option to display child items without a group item.  At the moment Ive got round this by creating a single group All items.  This doesnt look good on the UI.  Ive tried setting it to expanded and visibility a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidviewView.htmlGONE relnofollowcodeGONEcodea but that still leaves the group item in place, just blank.

Negative 820 pI am developing a framework and several example applications that use the framework at the same time.p  pIdeally, I would like to be able two switch back and forth between the two without having to do anything special at all. For example, while developing one of the applications I discover that I need the framework to do something different. Id like to open the framework in another window, make the changes, compile it, go back to one of the applications, compile that and voila, the application has compiled with the new framework included.p  pIm guessing that I need to add a build phase to the framework that copies the frameworks bundle somewhere shared by all the applications, but Im not clear on where is the right place LibraryFrameworks LibraryFrameworks, and I dont think I am doing the copyfiles build phase right.p  pDoes anyone know of a fresh tutorial that handles exactly this case The ones Ive seen are quite old, and XCode has changed a lot. Can you describe the right technique simply Thanks so much.p  pI am running Xcode 6.3.1 on OSX 10.10.3. p

Negative 820 pI am trying to start using Travis for continuous integration, and all our tests pass except one, although it passes on our local OSX machines.

Negative 820 pIs there a way to give an SKNode its own physics I have an SKShapeNode call backGround which I use for the parent node of most of my other nodes. I am constantly moving background to the left, to give the illusion that the player is moving forward.

Negative 820 pAfter doing some profiling, weve discovered that the current way in which our app concatenates strings causes an enormous amount of memory churn and CPU time.p  pWere building a codeListltstringgtcode of strings to concatenate that is on the order of 500 thousand elements long, referencing several hundred megabytes worth of strings. Were trying to optimize this one small part of our app since it seems to account for a disproportionate amount of CPU and memory usage. p  pWe do a lot of text processing p  pTheoretically, we should be able to perform the concatenation in a single allocation and N copies  we can know how many total characters are available in our string, so it should just be as simple as summing up the lengths of the component strings and allocating enough underlying memory to hold the result.p  pAssuming were starting with a prefilled codeListltstringgtcode, is it possible to concatenate all strings in that list using a single allocationp  pCurrently, were using the codeStringBuildercode class, but this stores its own intermediate buffer of all of the characters  so we have an ever growing chunk array, with each chunk storing a copy of the characters were giving it. Far from ideal. The allocations for the array of chunks arent horrible, but the worst part is that it allocates intermediate character arrays, which means N allocations and copies.p  pThe best we can do right now is to call codeListltstringgt.ToArraycode  which performs one copy of a 500k element array  and pass the resulting codestring[]code to codestring.Concatparams string[]code. codestring.Concatcode then performs two allocations, one to copy the input array into an internal array, and the one to allocate the destination strings memory.p  pFrom referencesource.microsoft.comp  precode    public static String Concatparams String[] values          if values  null             throw new ArgumentNullExceptionvalues         Contract.EnsuresContract.ResultltStringgt  null          Spec Consider a postcondition saying the length of this string  the sum of each string in array         Contract.EndContractBlock         int totalLength0           gt Allocation 1 lt         String[] internalValues  new String[values.Length]          for int i0 iltvalues.Length i              string value  values[i]             internalValues[i]  valuenullString.Emptyvalue             totalLength  internalValues[i].Length              check for overflow             if totalLength lt 0                  throw new OutOfMemoryException                                return ConcatArrayinternalValues, totalLength           private static String ConcatArrayString[] values, int totalLength            gt Allocation 2 lt         String result   FastAllocateStringtotalLength         int currPos0          for int i0 iltvalues.Length i              Contract.AssertcurrPos lt totalLength  values[i].Length,                              [String.ConcatArray]currPos lt totalLength  values[i].Length              FillStringCheckedresult, currPos, values[i]             currPosvalues[i].Length                   return result      codepre  pThus, in the best case, we have three allocations, two for arrays referencing the component strings, and one for the destination concatenated string.p  pCan we improve on this Is it possible to concatenate a codeListltstringgtcode using a single allocation and a single loop of character copiesp  h1Edit 1h1  hr  pId like to summarize the various approaches discussed so far, and why they are still suboptimal. Id also like to set the parameters of the situation in concrete a little more, since Ive received a lot of questions that try to side step the central question.p  p...p  pFirst, the structure of the code that I am working within. There are three layersp  ul liLayer one is a set of methods that produce my content. These methods return smallish string objects, which I will call my component strings. These string objects will eventually be concatenated into a single string. I do not have the ability to modify these methods I have to face the reality that they return string objects and move forward.li liLayer two is my code that calls these content producers and assembles the output, and is the subject of this question. I must call the content producer methods, collect the strings they return, and eventually concatenate the returned strings into a single string reality is a little more complex the returned strings are partitioned depending on how theyre routed for output, and so I have several sets of large collections of strings.li liLayer three is a set of methods that accept a single large string for further processing. Changing the interface of that code is beyond my control.li ul  pTalking about some numbers a typical batch run will collect 500000 strings from the content producers, representing about 200500 MB of memory. I need the most efficient way to concatenate these 500k strings into a single string.p  p...p  pNow Id like to examine the approaches discussed so far. For the sake of numbers, assume were running 64bit, assume that we are collecting 500000 string objects, and assume that the aggregate size of the string objects totals 200 megabytes worth of character data. Also, assume that the original string objects memory is emnot countedem toward any approachs total in the below analysis. I make this assumption because it is necessarily common to any and all approaches, because it is an assumption that we cannot change the interface of the content producers  they return 500k relatively small fully formed strings objects that I must then accept and somehow concatenate. As stated above, I cannot change this interface.p  h2Approach 1h2  pemContent producers  codeStringBuildercode  codestringcodeemp  pConceptually, this would be invoking the content producers, and directly writing the strings they return to a codeStringBuildercode, and then later calling codeStringBuilder.ToStringcode to obtain the concatenated string.p  pBy analyzing codeStringBuildercodes implementation, we can see that the cost of this boils down to 400 MB of allocations and copiesp  ul liDuring the stage where we collect the output from the content producers, were writing 200 MB of data to the codeStringBuildercode. We would be performing one 200 MB allocation to preallocate the codeStringBuildercode, and then 200 MB worth of copies as we copy and discard the strings returned from the content producersli liAfter weve collected all output from the content producers and have a fully formed codeStringBuildercode, we then need to call codeStringBuilder.ToStringcode. This performs exactly one allocation codestring.FastAllocateStringcode, and then copies the string data from its internal buffers to the string objects internal memory.li ul  pstrongTotal cost approximately 400 MB of allocations and copiesstrongp  h2Approach 2h2  pemContent producers  preallocated codechar[]code  codestringcodeemp  pThis strategy is fairly simple. Assuming we know roughly how much character data were going to be collecting from the producers, we can preallocate a codechar[]code that is 200 MB large. Then, as we call the content producers, we copy the strings they return into our codechar[]code. This accounts for 200 MB of allocations and copies. The final step to turn this into a string object is to pass it to the codenew stringchar[]code constructor. However, since strings are immutable and arrays are not, the constructor will make a copy of that entire array, causing it to allocate and copy another 200 MB of character data. p  pstrongTotal cost approximately 400 MB of allocations and copiesstrongp  h2Approach 3h2  pemContent producers  codeListltstringgtcode  codestring[]code  codestring.Concatstring[]codeemp  ul liPreallocate a codeListltstringgtcode to be about 500k elements  approximately 4 MB of allocations for Lists underlying array 500k  8 bytes per pointer  4 MB of memory.li liCall all of the content producers to collect their strings. Approximately 4 MB of copies, as we copy the pointer to the returned string into Lists underlying array.li liCall codeListltstringgt.ToArraycode to obtain a codestring[]code. Approximately 4 MB of allocations and copies again, were really just copying pointers.li liCall codestring.Concatstring[]code  ul liConcat will make a copy of the array provided to it before it does any real work. Approximately 4 MB of allocations and copies, again.li liConcat will then allocate a single destination string object using the internal codestring.FastAllocateStringcode special method. Approximately 200 MB of allocations.li liConcat will then copy strings from its internal copy of the provided array directly into the destination. Approximately 200 MB of copies.li ulli ul  pstrongTotal cost approximately 212 MB of allocations and copiesstrongp  hr  pNone of these approaches are ideal, however approach 3 is very close. Were assuming that the absolute minimum of memory that needs to be allocated and copied is 200 MB for the destination string, and here we get pretty close  212 MB. p  pIf there were a codestring.Concatcode overload that 1 Accepted an codeIListltstringgtcode and 2 did not make a copy of that IList before using it, then the problem would be solved. No such method is provided by .Net, hence the subject of this question.p  h1Edit 2h1  hr  pstrongProgress on a solutionstrong.p  pIve done some testing with some hacked IL, and found that directly invoking codestring.FastAllocateStringncode which is not usually invokable... is about as fast as invoking codenew string0, ncode, and both emseemem to allocate exactly as much memory as is expected.p  pFrom there, it seems its possible to acquire a pointer to the freshly allocated string using the codeunsafecode and codefixedcode statements. p  pAnd so, a rough solution begins to appearp  precode    private static string Concat Listltstringgt list               int concatLength  0          for int i  0 i lt list.Count i                       concatLength  list[i].Length                   string newString  new string 0, concatLength           unsafe                      fixed char ptr  newString                               ...                                return newString      codepre  pThe next biggest hurdle is implementing or finding an efficient block copy method, ala Buffer.BlockCopy, except one that will accept codecharcode types.p

I have posted a sample of my code Note I am using App Engine for this applicationp  precode ...logic to get authcode, etc...

The first URL does the job for me, but it is a GET request this is in contrast to the second URL which requires a POST. p  pIve also read that the GET endpoint is being deprecated, as mentioned in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma245102141058612this SOa answer.

Negative 820 pI am struggling to see how to use Entity Framework Code First migrations to target multiple identical Oracle databases, where each database exists in its own schema.

This fails when generating an initial migration, with the error Value cannot be null. Parameter name seqOwner.  This suggests to me that the OracleMigrationSqlGenerator is not intended to work without specific Schema names.pli lipFinding some way to pull the Oracle user name out of the current connection string, and use that as the schema name in the migration.  Ive already had to do this in the app itself, to stop Entity Framework looking in the dbo Schema for an Oracle database, but that was done by examining ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings when the model is built, Im not sure how the same would be achieved from inside migration code.pli lipSimilar to 2, but just using a variable somewhere  maybe in the appsettings element in the Web.config, to store the Oracle schema, and referring to that from inside the migration code.  An Oracle migration script would then refer to this variable instead to find out the schema.

I am using supervised learning to train our model with a GMM.p  pAll the training data is read from XML files. After calculating the features, their values are stored into a linked list.

Also an instance of a second script called playback will be included. This script manages the state of the player. Clicks on the player buttons call functions in the playback script.p  pNow when you press play for the very first time, the jPlayer object will be initialized, before finally the function playCurrent is called to play the current MP3 file in the queue.p  pThe initialization of the jPlayer objectp  precodejQueryplayerID.jPlayer         swfPath scriptPath  jquery.jplayer.swf,         ready function              if stoppedByError                   move the cursor to part 0 and play it                 if singleStringMode                      moveCursor0                                     console.logFIRST START                  update the player status                 setPlayerStatus1                  play the current text part                 playCurrent                      ,         ended functionevent              if stoppedByError                  self.goToNext                      ,         errorAlerts false,         supplied mp3,         error functionevent              if stoppedByError                  handlePlayerError                        codepre  pThe code to start the playback in the function playCurrentp  precodejQueryplayerID.jPlayersetMedia,      mp3 textParts[currentPart].mp3     ogg sample.ogg .jPlayerplay codepre  pOf course the assigned URL of the MP3 textParts[currentPart].mp3 is checked before this code to make sure the MP3 has successfully been transmitted from the server.p  pAll of this works fine on desktop PCs in Chrome, Firefox and newer versions of IE. However, on some mobile devices iOS, Android there is a strange bug When you press the play button for the first time, it changes to a pause button, but the playback does not start. Only when you press the button two more times once to pause the playback and one more time to start it again, everything works as in desktop browsers.p  pI am aware that jPlayers autoplay generally does not work on mobile devices, so this option is just turned off on mobile. But I can not find any good explanation why the playback fails at the first attempt. I used jConsole for mobile debugging and there wasnt any error. One thing that I tried was to assign some silent dummy MP3 file to the jPlayer instance in the ready function to really make sure that some audio is available when the player is started for the first time, but it didnt help either.p  pThis doesnt seem to be a general problem of jPlayer as I tested the demo sites for MP3 playback on the same devices and it works just fine. What is also very odd that the problem does not apply to Windows Mobile, just iOS and Android.p  pAny suggestions what could go wrong in the process of initializing jPlayer and starting it for the first timep

Negative 820 pWeve implemented rich snippets for a product type, as well as rich snippets for the organization type.p  pBoth types have their attributes passed into a JSONLD type script wrapper.p  pstrongPlease see the markup and validation here a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comstructureddatatestingtoolurlhttp253A252F252Fwww.jomashop.com252Fpanerailuminormenwatchpam00104.htmlampfilterRICHSNIPPETSPRODUCTS relnofollowStructured Data Testing Toolastrongp  pGoogle picks up the organization type and this is verifiable because weve actually changed the logo on our organization card. p  pstrongemHowever, Google has not picked up any of the rich snippets attributes for our products.emstrongp  pstrongNotestrong Both the product snippet and organization snippet validate perfectly, without any errors or warnings on the Structured Data Testing Tool. I do not think this is an issue with markup unless there is something instrinsically wrong with JSONLD formatted rich snippets as opposed to the inline markup varietyp  pstrongAdditional Notestrong These JSONLDs have been printed inside all of our product pages 30,000 for well over 3 months now, with no change.
