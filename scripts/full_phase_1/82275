Positive 82275 pFirst of all I apologize for the vague title, but the problem is that Im not sure what is causing the error.p  pIm using Python to extrapolate some data from a website. The code I created works perfectly when passing one link at the time, but somehow breaks when trying to collect the data from the 8000 pages I have it actually breaks way before. The process I need to do is thisp  ol liCollect all the links from one single page 8000 linksli liFrom each link extrapolate another link contained in an iframeli liScrape the date from the link in 2.li ol  pPoint 1 is easy and works fine. Point 2 and 3 works for a while and then I get some errors. Every time at a different point and its never the same. After some tests, I decided to try a different approach and run my code until point 2 on all the links in 1, trying to collect all the links first. And at this point I found out that, probably, I get the error during this stage. The code works like this in a for cycle I pass each item of a list of urls to the function below. Its supposed to search for a link to the Disqus website. There should be only one link and there is always one link. Because with a library as lxml, its not possible to scan inside the iframe, I use selenium and the ChromeDriver.p  precodedef geturlwebpageurl     chromedriverpath Applicationschromedriver      driver  webdriver.Chromechromedriverpath      driver.getwebpageurl     iframesdriver.findelementsbytagnameiframe     listurls[]     urls[]       collects all the urls of all the iframe tags     for iframe in iframes         driver.switchtoframeiframe         time.sleep3         listurls.appenddriver.currenturl         driver.switchtodefaultcontent     driver.quit      for item in listurls         if item.startswithhttpdisqus             urls.appenditem      if lenurlsgt1         print too many urls collected in iframes     else         urlurls[0]      return url codepre  pAt the beginning there was no time.sleep and it worked for roughly 30 links. Then I put a time.sleep2 and it arrived to about 60. Now with time.sleep3 it works for around 130 links. Of course, this cannot be a solution. The error I get now, its always the same index out of range in urlurls[0], but each time with a different link. If I check my code with the single link where it breaks, the code works, so it can actually find urls there. And of course, sometimes passes a link where it stopped before and it works with no issue. I suspect I get this because maybe of a timeout, but of course Im not sure.p  pSo, how can I understand whats the issue, herep  pIf the problem is that it makes too many requests even though the sleep, how can I deal with thisp  pThank you.p
Positive 82275 pIm testing a responsive website where a different image is used if a browser is reduced in size or when viewed on a phone.

Positive 82275 pI am trying out cucumber for browser testing and am learning about BDD testing for the first time  so i am quite a beginner to BDD. I have encountered a problem and would like to know the bestpractice way of solving it.p  pemI am using it for a node.js webapp, so it is cucumber.js and selenium WebDriverJS, but the platform should not matter for this questionemp  pstrongDESCRIPTIONstrongp  pIn tutorials for the Gherkin syntax, you often see examples on clicking a button at a specific page, like for example p  precodeGiven something When I click the submit button Then something codepre  pImplementing the stepdefinition for this step is quite simple  just make selenium locate the element with whatever cssselector happens to match the button and then make selenium click on it.p  pstrongPROBLEMstrongp  pBut what if you have different buttons on different pages with the same human readable name i.e. the same name in the cucumber steptext, but which must be located by different cssselectorsp  pIt seems that you cant have stepdefinitions which are local to features, but that all stepdefinitions are shared among all features. This means that if you create a step I click the submit button, as above, the stepdefinition must work for testing all pages in the entire webapp which has a submit button. I am not really sure what is the proper way to do this.p  pstrongQUESTIONstrongp  pWhat is the best practice for handling thisp  hr  pstrongEXAMPLE OF THE PROBLEMstrongp  pLets say we have 3 pages which all have a next button, which does something completely different on each page and are located completely differently in the DOM. Lets say we have one feature for each of these pages. In each feature, the scenarios involving the next button looks like this p  precodeGiven I am on page xyz And ... And I click the next button And ... When ... Then ... codepre  pThe problem is that on the first page, the next button is perhaps located by .nextbutton, on the second page it could be someContainer .btn.btnprimary and on the third pageassetButtons linthchild3. If we had a stepdefinition local to each feature, they could simply look like p  precodethis.GivenI click the next button, functioncallback      this.driver.findElementthis.webdriver.By.css.nextbutton.click     callback   this.GivenI click the next button, functioncallback      this.driver.findElementthis.webdriver.By.csssomeContainer .btn.btnprimary.click     callback   this.GivenI click the next button, functioncallback      this.driver.findElementthis.webdriver.By.cssassetButtons linthchild3.click     callback  codepre  pBut since the stepdefinitions are global to all features, and you naturally cant create two stepdefinitions for the same regex, the stepdefinition for I click the next button need to know which page we are on or which next button the scenario is referring to.p  hr  pstrongSome of my own thoughtsstrong emoptional readingemp  ul liCould make the stepnames less generic and make them also refer to  which page the button is on I click the next button on the front page.  The problem with this is that we already wrote in the scenario that we are  on that page, so it is redundant.li liCould make up different names for the next button on the different pages  like front page next and search page next. li liCould make the stepdefinition detect which page you are currently on and use different cssselectors depending on the page. It could query selenium for the current URL, for example, and lookup which cssselector to use, based on both the buttonname from the step and the current page.li liCould include the cssselector in the steptext itself. But that is not quite human readable and doesnt seem like the BDD way.li liChoose a higher abstraction level, where you dont talk about buttons, etc, but the higher level action, such as I go to the next page in the search results. does not seem like a good approach in general  often the exact steps are important, since the same action can often be done in different ways, and all of those paths should of course be exercised by the test. For example, if you could also go to the next page by pressing N or swiping, this would only test 1 of these cases but could of course include that in the steptext too.li ul  pBut what is the RIGHT way to do itp

Positive 82275 pI am using Selenium WebDriver to automate the downloading of videos from a few online video converting sites.p  pBasically, all the user has to do is enter the URL of a YouTube video and the program will run the script to download the videos for you.p  pEverything runs very smoothly, but the problem is when the website fails to convert the video. p  pFor example, clipconverter.cc sometimes throws an Unable to get video infos from YouTube error, but it works when you try again. I have done some error checking in the event that there are missing elements and the program will stop running the script but in the example I mentioned above, I want to rerun the script again.p  pWhat is a possible way of achieving this Do I have to recreate the error page and get the elements presented therep
Positive 82275 pWhen my script opens the chromedriver codedriver  webdriver.Chromecode in Windows 10, the window maximizes to full size on my monitor. To minimize disruption, I would prefer it was barely noticeable. The closest I can get is the followingp  precode    driver  webdriver.Chrome     driver.setwindowsize1, 1 codepre  pThis works well in that the window size is minimal. Unfortunately, it still first pops open to the full monitor and then readjusts to the preferred minimal size. Is there any way to preset the window size before opening up the chromedriverp
Positive 82275 pSince WebElement is an interface, it means that all the methods present in the WebElement interface are abstract, i.e. they dont have a body.

Positive 82275 pFrom time to time, I find myself spending quite a bit of time diagnosing and troubleshooting false positives that come from my automated tests.  Out of a few hundred tests driven in a browser, around 4 of them fail with seemingly no rhyme or reason, and they tend to be different each and every time.  For example, some simple shared steps may work in one example but then fail for no reason in another.p  pIve continued to spend time troubleshooting and improving these areas improving waiting on elements, improved preconditions, etc but it seems to only help marginally.  Anecdotally, this phenomenon seems to worsen when using IE11 vs Chrome.p  pIve come across a neat gem called coderspecretrycode which simply retries any failed tests as they come along.  Im wondering what the consensus is with this approach, as Im adamant of making sure that Im testing the right way.p

Negative 82275 pI want to build a parser for a C like language. The interesting aspect about it is that I want to build it in such a way that someone who has access to the source can easily modified it to extend the language a new expression type of instance with the extensions being runtime configurable they can be turned on and off.p  pMy current intent is to build a recursive decent parser as an object. Each production will be a method of an object. The method of extension will be to derive classes from this base replacing methods and production definitions as needed. Im still trying to figure out how to mix and match extensions. One idea is to play games with the vtbl. Objects would be constructed with a vtbl that is a copy of the base but with methods replaced from derived classes.p  pAside from the bittwiddling nature of the solution the only issues I have with it isp  ul lia reasonable way to do the vtbl mixupli liwhat to do when 2 extensions alter the same  productions as most replacements will end up calling the original having one replacement call the other would work but the mechanics of setting this up are the issueli lihow to allow the extension of extensions this might end up looking like a standard MI system, but Ive never got how they workli ul  pAnother solution a slightly more mundane version of the same same approach would be to use static member variables to store functionpointers and call them for the same effect.p  pemEditem I have already built a system that lets me build productions from BNF definitions. I can alter it to support whatever I decide on.p

Negative 82275 pI am currently working on a SharePoint project that needs to use the Lists SharePoint web service Lists.asmx. Therefore, we need to add a service reference to it in Visual Studio. However, we all develop and test on different virtual machines with different VM names, URLs, etc.. The QA, Test and Production environments all have different names and URLs as well.p  pAdding a service reference adds a bunch of references to the URL that was specified when the reference was created in the app.config. .wsdl, .disco, etc.. This is obviously a problem for us as code that works on one machine wont work anywhere else which breaks the build and continuous integration We also have to delete and add the service reference every time we work with code that was checkedin by someone else.p  pThis must be a fairly common problem for people developing Web services so I wondered if there was a way around it. I know you cant really create a dynamic web reference, but perhaps the impacts of the URL change could be minimized somehow p  pThanksp

Negative 82275 pApologies for the rather verbose and longwinded post, but this problems been perplexing me for a few weeks now so Im posting as much information as I can in order to get this resolved quickly.p  pWe have a WPF codeUserControlcode which is being loaded by a 3rd party app. The 3rd party app is a presentation application which loads and unloads controls on a schedule defined by an XML file which is downloaded from a server.p  pOur control, when it is loaded into the application makes a web request to a web service and uses the data from the response to display some information. Were using an MVVM architecture for the control. The entry point of the control is a method that is implementing an interface exposed by the main app and this is where the controls configuration is set up. This is also where I set the codeDataContextcode of our control to our codeMainViewModelcode.p  pThe codeMainViewModelcode has two other view models as properties and the main codeUserControlcode has two child controls. Depending on the data received from the web service, the main codeUserControlcode decides which child control to display, e.g. if there is a HTTP error or the data received is not valid, then display child control A, otherwise display child control B. As youd expect, these two child controls bind two separate view models each of which is a property of codeMainViewModelcode. p  pNow child control B which is displayed when the data is valid has a codeRefreshServicecode propertyfield. codeRefreshServicecode is an object that is responsible for updating the model in a number of ways and  contains 4 codeSystem.Timers.Timercodes p  ul lia codemodelRefreshTimercodeli lia codeviewRefreshTimercodeli lia codepageSwitchTimercodeli lia coderetryFeedRetrievalOnErrorTimercode this is only enabled when something goes wrong with retrieving data.li ul  pI should mention at this point that there are two types of data the first changes every minute, the second changes every few hours. The controls configuration decides which type we are usingdisplaying. p  ol lipIf data is of the first type then we update the model quite frequently every 30 seconds using the codemodelRefreshTimercodes events.pli lipIf the data is of the second type then we update the model after a longer interval. However, the view still needs to be refreshed every 30 seconds as stale data needs to be removed from the view hence the codeviewRefreshTimercode.pli ol  pThe control also paginates the data so we can see more than we can fit on the display area. This works by breaking the data up into Lists and switching the codeCurrentPagecode which is a List property of the view model to the right List. This is done by handling the codepageSwitchTimercodes Elapsed event.p  h2Now the problemh2  pMy problem is that the control, when removed from the visual tree doesnt dispose of its timers. This was first noticed when we started getting an unusually high number of requests on the web server end very soon after deploying this control and found that requests were being made at least once a second We found that the timers were living on and not stopping hours after the control had been removed from view and that the more timers there were the more requests piled up at the web server.p  pMy first solution was to implement codeIDisposablecode for the codeRefreshServicecode and do some clean up  when the controls codeUnLoadedcode event was fired. Within the codeRefreshServicecodes Dispose method Ive set codeEnabledcode to codefalsecode for all the timers, then used the codeStopcode method on all of them. Ive then called codeDisposecode too and set them to codenullcode. None of this worked.p  pAfter some reading around I found that event handlers may hold references to Timers and prevent them from being disposed and collected. After some more reading and researching I found that the best way around this was to use the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryaa970850.aspx relnofollowWeak Event Patterna. Using a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.comdelayarchive20090309controlsarelikediapersyoudontwantaleakyoneimplementingtheweakeventpatternonsilverlightwiththeweakeventlistenerclass.aspx relnofollowthisa blog and a hrefhttpweblogs.asp.netokloetenarchive200711125090199.aspx relnofollowthisa blog Ive managed to work around the shortcomings in the Weak Event pattern.p  pstrongHowever, none of this solves the problem.strong Timers are still not being disabled or stopped let alone disposed and web requests are continuing to build up. Mem Profiler tells me that This type has N instances that are directly rooted by a delegate. This can indicate the delegate has not been properly removed where N is the number of instances. As far as I can tell though, all listeners of the Elapsed event for the timers are being removed during the cleanup so I cant understand why the timers continue to run.p  pThanks for reading.

Negative 82275 pI am developing web application where users have collection of tags. I need to create a suggestion list for users based on the similarity of their tags. br For example, when a user logs in to the system, system gets his tags and search these tags in the DB of users and showing users who have similar tags. For instance if strongUser 1strong has following tags [strongemLinux, Apache, MySQL, PHPemstrong] and strongUser 2strong has [strongemWindows, IIS, PHP, MySQLemstrong] it says that strongUser 2strong matchs strongUser 1strong with a weight of 50, because he has 2 similar tagsstrongemPHPemstrong and strongemMySQLemstrong. br But imagine the situation where strongUser 1strong has [strongemASP, IIS, MS Accessemstrong] and strongUser 2strong has [strongemPHP, Apache, MySQLemstrong]. In this situation my system doesnt suggest strongUser 2strong as a emfriendem to strongUser 1strong or vice versa. But we know that these two users has similarity on the field of work, both works on Web Technology or Web Programming, etc. br So, that is why I need kind of taxonomy of computer science right now, but probably I would need taxonomy of other fields also, like medicine, physics, mathematics, etc. where these concepts are categorized and so that when I search for similarity of strongemASPemstrong and strongemPHPemstrong, for example, it can say that they have similarity and belong into one groupor category.br I hope I described my problem clearly, but if something wrong explained would be happy for your corrections. brThanksp

Negative 82275 pWe have a SQL Server database with a millionish records that are indexed by codeLucene.netcode through codeNhibernate.Searchcode.

Negative 82275 pI have a question about Django, unixODBC, FreeTDS, Apache2, modwsgi, that is somewhat similar to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1904505djangofailssometimesveryerraticbehaviorthis questiona asked before on SO.p  pI have a Django website built to run on the latest Django, that is, 1.2.3. It uses managed models for the most part, in that, save for the session information, nothing is written to the DB by Django, only read from it. p  pThe DB in question is hosted on a Windows machine on MSSQL 2005. p  pThe Django project is hosted on a Linux machine. It is served over modwsgi on Apache2. The DB connection is through the infamous FreeTDS and unixODBC duo. Latest versions of both FreeTDS and unixODBC are running. On the Python end, pyodbc, and djangopyodbc are used for the DB stuff.p  pThe project is deployed on two Linux live servers, with identical setups, that are behind a load balancer. There is one DB server that both connect to. p  pOn the live, production servers, there are some intermittent issues. On the pages that query the DB to get records to display, sometimes, and I mean sometimes, an exception is thrown, with the error p  precodeIM001, [IM001] [unixODBC][Driver Manager]Driver does not support this function 0 SQLColAttribute codepre  pOne of the strange bits about this conundrum is that whenever you get this error, simply hitting refresh on the web browser clears it and renders the page with the records fetched from the DB. p  pThe generated SQL, from the debug output when the error occurs, is very simplep  precodeSELECT COUNT FROM [TABLE] WHERE [TABLE].[category]  5 AND [TABLE].[newRelease]  1  codepre  pOn the Django development server, this doesnt show up, of course. On the development machine, with modwsgi running in daemon mode, I came across this error a number of times. I tested by deploying on modpython, where I didnt see any errors. I then tested with modwsgi in embedded mode, where, as well, I didnt see any errors. I think changed the setup on the live server to use modwsgi in embedded mode, but the errors still crop up sometimes. p  pI am really stuck with this. I am not sure what to try to get closer to figuring out whats really causing the problem. I am not sure whether I have provided all helpful information. If I havent, please do point it out, and I will update the question.p  pI dont believe there is anything in the code that is wrong and causing this. It wouldnt work most or all of the time, if it were the case. Ive tried clearing .pyc files, restarting Apache, etc, on the live servers, but to no avail. p  pAny, any help will be very much appreciated. p  pThanks.p  pstrongUPDATEstrong I tacked the nevercache decorator to most of the view functions, hoping that perhaps whatever little modellevel caching that Django does could be turned off.

Negative 82275 h2Quick summaryh2  pPinging back to a webservice in ajax from the client keeps the users session alive, I dont want this to happen.p  h2More extensive summaryh2  pFor a website were developing, we need the client to ping back in js to a webservice ASMX on the server IIS7.5. This happens to let the server know that the user is still on the site, and hasnt browsed away to another site.p  pThis is as our customer wants to let users lock records, but if they browse away to other sites, then let other people take over those locked records. Perhaps the distinction between the client being on the site but inactive and on another site seems unimportant, but thats kinda irrelevant, I dont get to write the UI spec, I just have to make it work.p  pMy problem is this, the ping stops the user from being timed out on the server through the standard forms authentication timeout mechanism. Not surprising as there is that 30 second ping in the background keeping the session alive. Even though we want to know if the user is still on the site, we want the normal forms authentication timeout mechanism to be honoured.p  pI thought I might be able to fix this by removing the ASP.NETSessionId and .ASPXAUTH cookies in the XMLHttpRequest that is the server ping, but I cant figure out how to do this.p  pThis is how my web service amp method are definedp  precode[WebServiceNamespace  httptempuri.org] [WebServiceBindingConformsTo  WsiProfiles.BasicProfile11] [ScriptService] public class PingWS  WebService      [WebMethod]     public void SessionActivestring sessionID               does stuff here      codepre  pThis is how Im calling it in js request is over HTTPS, p  precode.ajax     type POST,     url PingWS.asmxSessionActive,     data sessionID  aspSessionID  ,     beforeSend function xhr          xhr.setRequestHeaderCookie,          xhr.setRequestHeaderCookie, ASP.NETSessionIdaaa .ASPXAUTHbbb     ,     dataType json  codepre  pI was trying with the setRequestHeader, but that just appends to the header rather than overwrites the header, and IIS is happy to ignore that junk I added.p  pIm thinking maybe I should be trying to do this at the server end, someone take PingWS.asmx out of the loop so that it doesnt keep the session active, but Im not sure how to do this.p  pAlthough the title of the question is focused on clearing the cookie in the header, Id be super happy if anyone points out that Im being really stupid and there is actually a much better way of trying to do what Im doing.p  pIm thinking at this stage maybe I need to add something to the webmethod that says how long this particular page has been inactive, and use that knowledge to timeout manually. That actually sounds pretty easy, so I think Ill do that for now. Im still convinced that there must be an easy way to do what I originally wanted to do though.p  h2Updateh2  pIm thinking Im pretty screwed in terms of cookie manipulation here as both the .ASPXAUTH and ASP.NETSessionId cookie are HttpOnly, which means the browser takes them out of your hands, you cant access them via the document.cookies object. So I would say that leaves me withp  ol liUpdating my SessionAlive webmethod to track each request so I can tell how long the user has been sitting idle on a page and timeout if needs beli liMarking the .asmx page somehow on the server end so that its taken out of the normal authenticationsession tracking flowli ol  pI know how to do 1. so Ill start there but 2. seems much cleaner to me.p

Negative 82275 pI have a couple of small programs that a mate of mine needs ported to OS X. Ive used Mono to get a couple other things working on a Mac before, but while it made the port extremely easy, it just seemed a bit unwieldy. For the apps that Im making I dont want to have to force the person to download and install the Mono framework, nor do I want to have to teach them how to open up a terminal, navigate to the applications directory, and have to use the codemono appname.execode command.p  pIm an absolute lover of Visual Studio and C. Because of this, Id like for my OS X development experience to be as similar to that as possible. I dont mind learning a new language in order to code for OS X, but I would like a visual designer for the GUI so that I can easily make the interface, and itd be nice for the language to be at least somewhat similar to C as well, although this isnt as big a requirement so long as the IDE is decently helpful. With Visual Studio I learn a lot just from the codecompletion that it offers who honestly wants to memorize a Classes every property and method..  .p  pstrongWhat Im looking forstrongp  precodea Good graphical interface designer that makes nativelooking OS X GUIs b Backend language that wont seem totally foreign to a C developer c Something that runs natively on OS X without a framework needing to be installed d As many Visual Studiolike features as possible. code completion, hints, etc codepre  pstrongAlso, what is the native interface calledstrong I see references to strongCocoastrong, strongGTKstrong, strongand a few othersstrong.

Negative 82275 pOk Ive been doing lots of vector math stuff and wrote my own template for it.p  pMy requirements are lots of vector maths addition, subtraction, scale, cross prod, and dot prod also I need to be able to pass my vector as a float[] so that openGL can make use of it.p  pIve been using this quite happily for sometime, today a lecturer saw it and groaned. There was two things he particularly hated one of which I understand, my use of inheritance because it didnt seem to follow an codeis acode style. And my casting codeTthiscode, of course he didnt have much in the way of a solution.p  pstrongFirststrong The inheritance, I need to be able to make use of vec2 to vec4s so I designed my vectors like this.p  precodetemplatelttypename Tgt Vector2D   public  getX, getY, setX, setY ....   templatelttypename Tgt Vector3D  public Vector2DltTgt   public  getZ, setZ ...   templatelttypename Tgt Vector4D  public Vector3DltTgt   public  getW, setW ...  codepre  pWhy is this bad and tbh I cant see how to improve it. I needwant to be able to define type and have getters and setters of some sort. If I rearranged it likep  precodetemplatelttypename T, int sizegt VectorT codepre  pId loose my code.getXcode, code.setXcode stuff and have to replace it with something like code.atcode or code[]code. tbh I prefer the readability of code.getXcode, although it would make operator definitions easier.p  pstrongSecondstrong I can see why this is bad, but to make it so I can pass these vectors into openGLs method that expect a float array Ive overloaded the splat operatorp  precode Defined in Vector2DltTgt operator  return Tthis  codepre  pAs I understand it, there is no guarantee that the compiler will put the member variables x,y,z,w at the beginning of the class, and if not careful I might end up passing the vtable instead. However I must admit Ive had no problems so far.p  pThe only way I can see around this is to maintain an array that gets returned. Which I suppose would be easier if I changed they way I deal with vectors in the first place.p
Negative 82275 pI am trying to speed up a piece of code by having background threads already setup to solve one specific task. When it is time to solve my task I would like to wake up these threads, do the job and block them again waiting for the next task. The task is always the same.p  pI tried using condition variables and mutex that need to go with them, but I ended up slowing my code down instead of speeding it up mostly it happened because the calls to all needed functions are very expensive codepthreadcondwaitpthreadcondsignalpthreadmutexlockpthreadmutexunlockcode.p  pThere is no point in using a thread pool that I  dont have either because it is a too generic construct here I want to address only my specific task. Depending on the implementation  I would also pay a performance penalty for the queue.p  pDo you have any suggestion for a quick wakeup without using codemutexcode or codeconvarcode p  pI was thinking in setup threads like timers reading an codeatomic variablecode if the variable is set to 1 the threads will do the job if it is set to 0 they will go to sleep for few microseconds I would start with microsecond sleep since I would like to avoid using codespinlockscode that might be too expensive for the CPU.

Negative 82275 pI have a Facebook app which loops forever when run in IE. In other browsers it works fine.p  pI need your help to debug this, but before that I need to mention how I have implemented it.p  pFB recommends that when user tries to access the app we should redirect the user to the app authorization page. From there FB will redirect using 302 code to an url which we like. In this case I ask FB to redirect to my apps url with a flag codeappLogin1code in query string. But along with that FB attaches a really long param codecodecode in the query string which is quite ugly. So, in this case I put a flag codeLoggedIncode in my PHP session and redirect the user back to the app url using a JS code codewindow.top.location.href  ltapp urlgtcode. This cleans the url in the location bar.p  pThis works fine in Firefox and Chrome, but in IE codeLoggedIncode flag is missing from the session after the code redirects from codeappLogincode stage. In fact it seems the PHP session has reset in this case. This confuses my app into believing that this is an initial request so it redirects user to the authorization page.p  pI hope the above makes sense. Really appreciate any insight.p  pstrongUpdate1strongp  pAs requested.

Negative 82275 pSince version 3.0, .NET installs a bunch of different reference assemblies under CProgram FilesReference AssembliesMicrosoft...., to support different profiles say .NET 3.5 client profile, Silverlight profile. Each of these is a proper .NET assembly that contains only metadata  no IL code  and each assembly is marked with the codeReferenceAssemblyAttributecode. The metadata is restricted to those types and member available under the applicable profile  thats how intellisense shows a restricted set of types and members. The reference assemblies are not used at runtime.p  pI learnt a bit about it from a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.combmsbuildarchive20070412newreferenceassemblieslocation.aspxthis blog posta.p  pId like to create and use such a reference assembly for my library. p  ol liHow do I create a metadataonly assembly  is there some compiler flag or ildasm postprocessor li liAre there attributes that control which types are exported to different profilesli liHow does the reference assembly resolution at runtime  if I had the reference assembly present in my application directory instead of the real assembly, and not in the GAC at all, would probing continue and my AssemblyResolve event fire so that I can supply the actual assembly at runtimeli ol  pAny ideas or pointers to where I could learn more about this would be greatly appreciated.p  pemUpdateem Looking around a bit, I see the .NET 3.0 reference assemblies do seem to have some code, and the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.runtime.compilerservices.referenceassemblyattribute.aspxReference Assembly attributea was only added in .NET 4.0. So the behaviour might have changed a bit with the new runtime.p  pemWhyem For my ExcelDNA  a hrefhttpexceldna.codeplex.comhttpexceldna.codeplex.coma  addin library, I create singlefile .xll addin by packing the referenced assemblies into the .xll file as resources. The packed assemblies include the users addin code, as well as the ExcelDNA managed library which might be referenced by the users assembly. p  pIt sounds rather complicated, but works wonderfully well most of the time  the addin is a single small file, so no installation of distribution issues. I run into not unexpected problems because of different versions  if there is an old version of the ExcelDNA managed library as a file, the runtime will load that instead of the packed one I never get a chance to interfere with the loading.p  pI hope to make a reference assembly for my ExcelDNA managed part that users can point to when compiling their addins.

I have 3 rows in the users column family key jsmith, yomama and bobbyjo.p  pNow I take down a node, either 2, 3 or 5 I didnt touch 1 yet since its my only seed, and I connect to 4, processing the following CQL query p  precodeselect Key, fullname, email, state, gender, birthyear from users codepre  pAS expected, it gives me my 3 rows even with 1 node missing.

Negative 82275 pI noticed that in Android API Level 11 ICS a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidviewMotionEvent.htmltransform28android.graphics.Matrix29 relnofollowcodeMotionEventcodea has a codetransformcode method that takes a codeMatrixcode. This would actually make something Im doing somewhat cleaner, but Im coding for Level 8.p  pIs there a convenient alternative to codeMotionEvent.transformcode that works on earlier versions of Android Id like historical and multitouch coordinates to all be transformed, and Id like it to correctly handle the distinction between relative versus absolute coordinates, which is where things get kind of tricky.p  pWhat I really want to know is if can I create a codeMotionEventcode thats a transformed copy of another codeMotionEventcode. I actually dont need arbitrary transformations, but I need to be able to both translate and scale. I believe I can translate with codeoffsetLocationcode, but I dont see any way to scale a codeMotionEventcode prior to Level 11. In particular, how can I transform the coordinates of a multitouch event The codeobtaincode methods just take a single x,y pair, not an array.p  pThe reason I want to do this is that I have one object that dispatches events to a set of child objects. Right now each of those children transforms the coordinates in a kind of ad hoc way. The parent the dispatcher knows what transformation needs to be performed, however, so it would be a lot cleaner to just transform the codeMotionEventcode or a copy before dispatching it to the children. Alternatively I could create my own class that either wraps the codeMotionEventcode or copies and transforms the data out of a codeMotionEventcode, but it would be a lot simpler if I could use a codeMotionEventcode.p

Negative 82275 pThis one has me stumped.  I have three classes  a large class called codeLevelcode that contains, among other things, a multidimensional vector of pointers to codePlantcode instances and a multidimensional vector of pointers to codeMobcode instances both vectors are meant to classify the mobs and plants according to their position, so that I can search for each in a smaller vector based on their approximate location, rather than cycling through all existing plantsmobs in order to find the one nearest to a given point.p  pThe vectors are as follows, with the smallest stdvectors representing a square area of 128 pixels on each side.  Mobs and plants are classed by dividing their X and Y coords by 128 and adding them to the proper sector I am careful that the resulting values are in fact integers.p  pcodestdvectorlt stdvectorlt stdvectorltPlantgt gt gt mPlantSectorscodep  pcodestdvectorlt stdvectorlt stdvectorltMobgt gt gt mAnimalSectorscodep  pThe mobs sometimes need to find plants.  Here is where the problem arises when the mobs query the multidimensional vector, searching for plants in their approximate area if the mobs coords128 are, say, [1,2] it searches mPlantSectors[2][1], they sometimes find plants that dont exist.  p  pNot only that, but these plants have impossible positions, on the order of 1.9777e33 or 3.75853e39 for instance.  When I try to change the color of the chosen plant to red in order to find it visually, I find that none of the plants on the screen the only plants are ones Ive handplaced have changed color.  p  pIve marked all the plants with an integer ID there are 36 plants, with IDs from 136, but the plants my mobs find have IDs like 63 or 429  ones that cant possibly exist, since no such number of plants was created there is a single plant creation function that consistently reports how many plants exist, so no plants are being accidentally created.  The mobs all run off to the upperleft part of the screen after the imaginary plants, and die of starvation.p  pSo somehow, I an creating ghost plants.  So far, Ive tried two separate approaches for allowing codeMobcode instances to look for codePlantcode instances.  The first looks like thisp  precode    float TargetDist  256  256     Plant Candidate  0     Plant ForageTarget  0     int xSect  mX  128     int ySect  mY  128     stdvectorltPlantgt ThisSect  pLevelgtCheckPSectorxSect, ySect     for int i  0 i lt ThisSect.size i              cout ltlt Searching in Sector  ltlt ySect ltlt ,  ltlt xSect ltlt n         Candidate  ThisSect[i]         cout ltlt Candidate at  ltlt CandidategtGetX ltlt ,  ltlt CandidategtGetY ltlt n         CandidategtMark         Calculate distance         float xDist  CandidategtGetX  mX         float yDist  CandidategtGetY  mY         float tDist  sqrtxDist  xDist  yDist  yDist         if tDist lt TargetDist                      ForageTarget  Candidate             TargetDist  tDist               codepre  pWhere CheckPSector looks like thisp  precodestdvectorltPlantgt LevelCheckPSectorint x, int y      return mPlantSectors[y][x]  codepre  pThe second thing I tried was thisp  precode        float TargetDist  256  256         Plant Candidate  0         Plant ForageTarget  0         int xSect  mX  128         int ySect  mY  128         stdvectorlt stdvectorlt stdvectorltPlantgt gt gt Sectors  pLevelgtAccessPlantSectors         for int i  0 i lt Sectors[ySect][xSect].size i                      cout ltlt Searching in Sector  ltlt ySect ltlt ,  ltlt xSect ltlt n             Candidate  Sectors[ySect][xSect][i]             cout ltlt Candidate at  ltlt CandidategtGetX ltlt ,  ltlt CandidategtGetY ltlt n             CandidategtMark             Calculate distance             float xDist  CandidategtGetX  mX             float yDist  CandidategtGetY  mY             float tDist  sqrtxDist  xDist  yDist  yDist             if tDist lt TargetDist                              ForageTarget  Candidate                 TargetDist  tDist                       codepre  pUsing thisp  precodestdvectorlt stdvectorlt stdvectorltPlantgt gt gt LevelAccessPlantSectors      return ampmPlantSectors  codepre  pBoth of these, however, result in the animals finding imaginary plants and running off into the void.p  pI dont want to copy potentially large multidimensional vectors into codeMobcode instances on a regular basis, because there will be many such instances at any one time, and Id like the program to run somewhat smoothly.  Even so, I just tried to do the whole thing by copying the entire vector instead of just the relevant one, and I get the same result imaginary plants.p  pIve never quite had a problem like this before what could be happening herep  pEDIT Perhaps I should mention that getting the chosen plants to selfreport their own position and ID fails equally, turning up absurd results, so it isnt just the functions in codePlantcode I use to access private members.

For example consider the following two lines in a header file shared across multiple compilation unitsp  precode templateltclass Tgt void myFuncT in    templateltgt void myFuncltintgtint in   codepre  pNow from the Linux linker I would get something along the lines ofp  blockquote   pfile xyz Multiple definition of myFuncint in, first defined in some file.p blockquote  pBut how would I prevent that Since it works on Windows I suppose it should work on Linux too somehow p  pThe same goes for static template data members, which are more or less the same as above just that you declare a variable instead of a function. I would prefer if it worked for static template data members. p  pIf everything else fails I suppose I could still create a MakeAll.cpp file which just includes all CPP there are, but that doesnt sound like a desirable solution to me...p  pThanks for your helpp

Either c or c are acceptable as well.p  pYou can also assume that I only care about past or present dates, never the future.p  pCurrently I have a hack which looks like this I know localtimer is a library extension, but its close enough to the same functionality that I can make it portablep  precodestruct tm tm  convert the time string to a broken down structure in localtime ifstrptime200949, Ymd, amptm       convert the broken down structure into seconds since epoch     const timet t  mktimeamptm       convert it back to a broken down structure, this seems pointless at first...      but libc will fill out fields such as tmisdst     localtimerampt, amptm      printfDST  dn, tm.tmisdst  codepre  pWhile this works and seems to be a pretty effective way, I feel like its silly to be converting back and forth. Is there a better wayp

Apart from this image issue, all edits to HAMLSASS files work, and I can instantaneously see my changes. p  pI thought it might be some sort of browser renderingcaching issue, but similar issues occur in Firefox and Chrome. If I use Firebug I can sometimes see that the correct file is being picked up but its not showing in the page itself.p  pI can only think that this has something to do with Vagrant. The only thing that is guaranteed to fix it entirely is restrating the Vagrant box, but that takes a long time.p  pI realise that this may not be a simple problem, as it may have something to do with our Rails app and configuration of VagrantVirtualBox, but I just thought Id post the issue here in case anyone else has had similar issues.p  pThanksp

I read a bit about this and found out it is not possible to give administrative privileges to an already running process, and that I needed to use the COM elevation moniker to create a new process with administrative rights. httpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopms67968728vvs.8529.aspx Thats where the problem begins.p  pRight now, I have a COM atl dll with MFC support, merging of the proxystub code and support for COM, and I need to host an ActiveX control based on IWebBrowser2 in the one dialog contained MFC Dialog in this dll. However, after going through the elevation process and calling the exposed method to show the dialog, it always fails to launchdisplay. I have been looking around for solutions, and stumbled around some things, but cannot seem to fix the problem. Here are some things I have done p  pAdded AfxEnableControlContainer in the dlls InitInstance  CoInitializeExNULL, COINITMULTITHREAD in the thread that calls the dll. This actually causes the program to get an assertion fail wincore.cpp, line 884, afxmaphwnd  NULL apparently when trying to call the dialogs DoModal.p  pI tried purely removing the ActiveX control inside the dialog and if I do so, it seems to work fine, so the problem really looks like its linked with the ActiveX control.p  pI tried creating a nonmodal dialog never know I guess but the same problem occursp  pI have observed that in the output I get the following errors when the dialog is created dont know if it is the cause or consequence of my problem though  Firstchance exception at ...  0x800706BE The remote procedure call failed. Firstchance exception at ...  0x800706BA The RPC server is unavailable.p  pI might be missing something very basic student at University right now, so I might not know some stuff that may seem obvious to some, so if anyone has an idea about what might be wrong, please tell me.p

Negative 82275 pIm fairly new to Android development and I cant seem to grasp the Java Out of Memory exception. I know it means that my app has gone over the VM budget but after Googling this many times I still dont seem to grasp this concept. Im afraid that my app uses too much memory because I have six button selectors per screen with two bitmaps for each selector which are around 20 kb each according to the properties tab. On my rooted G2x I have set the VM budget to 12mb,restarted my phone and ran my app with no problems whatsoever. I am unbinding  drawables on each onDestroy and hinting at the GC to run here also. After using the app for a while in the emulator I click Cause GC on my DDMS screen and the results are  ID1, Heap Size 6.133 MB, Allocated 2.895MB, Free 3.238 MB,  Used 47.20,  Objects 52,623. p  pThis is where I dont understand whats happening, my emulator is set to 24MB of VM. Where is that number The actual problem Im having is that if i set the emulator to 16MB of VM my app crashes on the second activity with the Out of Memory exception. How come it doesnt crash on my phone with the VM set to 12 MB or on my old HTC Magic phone with 12 MB of VM stock Also do you guys think my app is taking up too much memory I have no idea if those DDMS numbers are good or not. Thanks for your time. p  pAs for my code I have every image specified in XML layouts I do not do anything programmaticly with them except for adding listeners to them. I found this bit of code on here and Ive added it to every activity that I have...p  precode    Override     protected void onDestroy                  super.onDestroy              unbindDrawablesfindViewByIdR.id.myRootLayout             System.gc            private void unbindDrawablesView view                  if view.getBackground  null                                  view.getBackground.setCallbacknull                          if view instanceof ViewGroup ampamp view instanceof AdapterView                                  for int i  0 i lt ViewGroup view.getChildCount i                                                  unbindDrawablesViewGroup view.getChildAti                                          ViewGroup view.removeAllViews                   codepre  pp  pOtherwise all I do is add onClickListeners to the buttons that have the PNG backgrounds. I would like to learn how to specify button backgrounds programmaticly but I need to have the selector functions like on focus, on press, nonfocused but pressed etc. to make the button backgrounds change according to user interaction. I have reviewed the docs about this but it seems overwhelming, thats why I figured Id start here with the basics of managing Heaps and work my way up to specifying selectors in code. This may not make sense but is there a healthy amount of memory allocation that an app could allocate without getting close to the Out of Memory exception For example if an app allocated 6MB it should be fine but 8MB would be pushing it, are there bounds like that in memory allocation Thanks again Alex Lockwood for your response Im going to read and reread it again until this stuff makes sense to mep

Negative 82275 pI have a ViewModel in Knockout that is derived mainly from the mapping plugin ie, dynamically. This works fine. However, now my client wants me to make sure that all inputs have whitespace trimmed off before submitting to the server. Obviously, the trimming code is very simple, but being relatively new to Knockout, Im not sure exactly where to put this code. I read about a hrefhttpknockoutjs.comdocumentationextenders.htmlextendersa, but that seems pretty verbose and repetitive to go back and add that to each observable. Plus Im not even sure I can do that to dynamically generated observables a la, the mapping plugin.p  pstrongIs there any central mechanism I can extendoverride where I can inject some trimming code every time an observable changesstrong Basically Im trying to avoid hours spent going through all of our forms and adding special binding syntax in the HTML if I dont have to.p  pThanks.p

Negative 82275 pI have a Java EE application that uses Log4J for logging. In the past we have supported deployment to OC4J, all is good.  We have 3 separate appenders thus 3 log files. p  pIn WebLogic 10.3.4, chaos is created. We have a single weblogic domain with two servers in it. The AdminServer and our application server.  When I deploy my application to the AdminServer, all is good. I see 3 log files in the domain directory. Goodness.p  pWhen I deploy to my other WebLog server in the same domain. All the log messages are pumped to the server.out file.  The server.out file, from what I read, is where nodemanager puts all logging messages for the server for stdoutstderr. Obviously, we need to deploy to the NonAdminServer...but our log files from log4j are not there.p  pI am racking my brain trying to figure out what is different between and AdminServer and a nonAdmin Server in WebLogic...and why it is confiscated my log messages.  The only diff I can see is the server is startedmanaged by nodemanager...p  pAny thoughtsp
Negative 82275 pWhen I call codecomponent.requestFocusInWindowcode, Swing enqueues asynchronous codeFOCUSGAINEDcode and codeFOCUSLOSTcode events rather than synchronously transferring focus. As a workaround, it appears that codeDefaultKeyboardFocusManagercode is trying to emsimulateem synchronously switching focus by delaying the dispatch of keyboard events until focus events have finished dispatching. But it appears that this isnt working properly.p  pQuestion Is there any way to change focus synchronously in Swing Is codeDefaultKeyboardFocusManagercode really trying to simulate synchronous focus, and is it seriously buggy Is there a focus manager that does this correctlyp  pMotivation I have a codeJTextFieldcode that automatically transfers focus when its full. In writing integration tests using codejava.awt.Robotcode, I need its behavior to be deterministic and not timingdependent.p  pRelated question that didnt get much response a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3389335swinghowtograbfocusnowHow to grab focus emnowemap  pHeres a demo. Expected behavior when you hold down a key, each codeJTextFieldcode will contain a single character. Actual behavior focus does not change fast enough so they get multiple characters.p  pstrongUpdatestrong Note that this behavior is not specific to progammatically changing focus. In the third example, I took out the custom focus calls and instead simply set the document update delay to 500ms. Then I typed kbd1kbdkbdTabkbdkbd2kbdkbdTabkbdkbd3kbdkbdTabkbdkbd4kbdkbdTabkbdkbd5kbdkbdTabkbdkbd6kbdkbdTabkbdkbd7kbdkbdTabkbdkbd8kbdkbdTabkbdkbd9kbdkbdTabkbdkbd0kbd.

Negative 82275 pI used Weka to successfully build a J48 C4.5 decision tree. I would now like to evaluate how effective or important my features are.p  pOne obvious way is to loop through all the features, remove one at a time, and rerun classification tests each time to see which feature has the largest drop in classification accuracy. However, this may hide codependencies between features.p  pHowever, I am thinking of another approach based on understanding the C4.5 algorithm. Since each split in the tree is based on a maximum information gain decision, a split on a feature closer to the root of the tree must mean that the feature had more information gain than a split with a different feature lower in the tree. So for a given feature F that occurs in several splits within the tree, I can calculate Fs average distance away from the root. I can then rank all the features by average distance, with the lowest average being the most valuable feature. Would this be a correct approachp

Negative 82275 pIm creating an HTML5 app for iPhone to run in a UIWebview using Sencha Touch 2. p  pIve created several methods to help myself to css animations. One of them does translate in the Y axis for me. Ive set on things like strongwebkitbackfacevisibilitystrong in my CSS to help smooth over animations. Ive tried strongwebkit perspectivestrong and strongwebkit preserve3dstrong, but they seem to not help.p  pAnyways, Ive gotten the animations to a point where they are very smooth. The problem is, if Im translating a large group of elements simultaneously, one of them wont translate. p  pLets say Im translating A, B, C, D, E, and F upwards. F will just skip right to the end  no translation. Its almost as if the strongwebkittransformstrong gets set before the strongwebkittransitiondurationstrong, which is not whats happening in my code. Furthermore, A, B, C, D, and E animation perfectly.p  pIm not even sure if this is exclusive to when Im animating a large group of elements, but that seems to be how it is happening now. If it happens to F, it will always happen to F  so it is at least consistent in that sense.p  pI even tried to fix it by dynamically creating a  element with a new class style equal to the transform and duration, embedding that in the DOM, and then setting the elements class equal to the class of the style. I got the same problem.p  pThe thing is, if I embed the final line of strongAnimations.translateYstrong in a setTimeout function, even for 1 millisecond delay, the everything will always animate. This, however, leads to the screen flickering nastily 33 of the time, which Im guessing is due to too many setTimeoutsp  pAs for browser consistency, I see the lack of animation without setTimeout in both chrome on my PC and the UIWebview on the iPhone device. I only see flicker with setTimeout on the iPhone device.p  precodeAnimations.translateY  functionelement, measurement, duration, callback, easing      Animations.setAnimationCallbackelement,callback      var css  translate3d0,measurement,0  duration  parseFloatduration element.style[webkittransitionduration]  duration  s     element.style[webkittransform]  css  codepre  pthe animation callback code..

I sort of mashed things together until it worked.p  pHowever, I just know Im doing something wrong here. I have RaiseCanExecuteChanged and CanExecute in the same area being called. Surely this is not how its donep  pHeres my xamlp  precodeltButton Margin10, 25, 10, 25 VerticalAlignmentCenter HorizontalAlignmentCenter Width50 Height50 Grid.Column1 Grid.Row3 ContentHostgt     ltiInteraction.Triggersgt         ltiEventTrigger EventNameClickgt             ltmvvmLightEventToCommand CommandBinding HostChat MustToggleIsEnabledTrue gt         ltiEventTriggergt     ltiInteraction.Triggersgt ltButtongt codepre  pAnd heres my codep  precodepublic override void InitializeViewAndViewModel      view  UnityContainer.ResolveltLoginPromptViewgt     viewModel  UnityContainer.ResolveltLoginPromptViewModelgt     view.DataContext  viewModel     InjectViewIntoRegionRegionNames.PopUpRegion, view, true      viewModel.HostChat  new DelegateCommandExecuteHostChat, CanHostChat     viewModel.PropertyChanged  new System.ComponentModel.PropertyChangedEventHandlerViewModelPropertyChanged   void ViewModelPropertyChangedobject sender, System.ComponentModel.PropertyChangedEventArgs e      if e.PropertyName  Name  e.PropertyName  Port  e.PropertyName  Address              viewModel.HostChat as DelegateCommand.RaiseCanExecuteChanged         viewModel.HostChat as DelegateCommand.CanExecute        public void ExecuteHostChat    public bool CanHostChat      if String.IsNullOrEmptyviewModel.Address          String.IsNullOrEmptyviewModel.Port          String.IsNullOrEmptyviewModel.Name              return false          else         return true  codepre  pSee how these two are together Surely that cant be right. I mean... it WORKS for me... but something seems wrong about it. Shouldnt RaiseCanExecuteChanged call CanExecute It doesnt... and so if I dont have that CanExecute in there, my control never toggles its IsEnabled like I need it to.p  precodeviewModel.HostChat as DelegateCommand.RaiseCanExecuteChanged viewModel.HostChat as DelegateCommand.CanExecute codepre  pEDITp  pIf I end up using the Command property of button to bind my command to... everything works fine. I can remove the CanExecute and just leave the RaiseCanExecuteChanged and everything works brilliantly.p  pLike this... this works just fine.p  precodeltButton CommandBinding HostChat Margin10, 25, 10, 25 VerticalAlignmentCenter HorizontalAlignmentCenter Width50 Height50 Grid.Column1 Grid.Row3 ContentHostgt ltButtongt  void ViewModelPropertyChangedobject sender, System.ComponentModel.PropertyChangedEventArgs e      if e.PropertyName  Name  e.PropertyName  Port  e.PropertyName  Address              viewModel.HostChat as DelegateCommand.RaiseCanExecuteChanged         viewModel.HostChat as DelegateCommand.CanExecute         CommandManager.InvalidateRequerySuggested       codepre

Negative 82275 pDoing a project for school where we implement the Nearest Neighbor heuristic which I have already done, and the Traveling Salesperson Problem where we do an exhaustive search we then analyze the algorithms, their time complexity, etc. Our teacher said to look around for code to use or modify for the exhaustive search part instead of programming the whole thing as in the Nearest Neighbor portion. I have looked around, put only found stuff that does not pertain to how we were instructed to do our program. As opposed to the typical problem where you use integers, we are using points x, y. My goal would be to calculate the shortest permutation and be able to know what that permutation was. So Im thinking to have an array of arrays which contains the permutations.p  pIf someone could help me out with the exhaustive search that would be nice.p  pHere is some excerpts from my code member variables, function to calculate distance between two points, and where all the points are storedp  precodeprivate int x private int y private boolean visited  public double dist point pt      int xdist  this.getX  pt.getX     int ydist  this.getY  pt.getY     double xsr  xdistxdist     double ysr  ydistydist     return Math.sqrt xsr  ysr    point[] points  new point[n] codepre  pAny help is greatly appreciated.p

A generalization of what is found at a hrefhttpblog.sigfpe.com200612evaluatingcellularautomatais.htmlEvaluating cellular automata is comonadica.p  precodedata U n  Nat x where   Point      x                           gt U Z     x   Dimension  [U n x] gt U n x gt [U n x] gt U S n x codepre  pThe idea is that the type codeU num xcode is the type of a codenumcodedimensional grid of codexcodes, which is focused on a particular point in the grid.p  pSo I wanted to make this a comonad, and I noticed that theres this potentially useful function I can makep  precodeufold  x gt U m r gt U n x gt U Plus n m r ufold f Point x  f x ufold f Dimension ls mid rs    Dimension map ufold f ls ufold f mid map ufold f rs codepre  pWe can now implement a dimension join that turns an ndimensional grid of mdimensional grids into an nmdimensional grid, in terms of this combinator. This will come in handy when dealing with the result of codecojoincode which will produce grids of grids.p  precodedimJoin  U n U m x gt U Plus n m x dimJoin  ufold id codepre  pSo far so good. I also noticed that the codeFunctorcode instance can be written in terms of codeufoldcode.p  precodeinstance Functor U n where   fmap f  ufold x gt Point f x codepre  pHowever, this results in a type error.p  precodeCouldnt match type n with Plus n Z codepre  pBut if we whip up some copy pasta, then the type error goes away.p  precodeinstance Functor U n where   fmap f Point x  Point f x   fmap f Dimension ls mid rs      Dimension map fmap f ls fmap f mid map fmap f rs codepre  pWell I hate the taste of copy pasta, so my question is this. strongHow can I tell the type system that codePlus n Zcode is equal to codencodestrong And the catch is this you cant make a change to the type family instances that would cause codedimJoincode to produce a similar type error.p

Negative 82275 pMy scenerio is a user could click on 12 different items on the page and depending on which item they click, a div will be populated with text.

Negative 82275 pSo, I am using Visual Studio 2012 with the onboard Windows SDK 8, writing Direct3D11 applications and i have a huge problem. I have a class which handles all the initialization, setup and draw calls on top off D3D11. I instantiate the application class which holds an instance of the D3D11 driver class properly with all the data it needs to know.p  pThe D3D11 driver class constructor takes the applications primary window handle and uses it to hook D3D into the applications primary window. It constructs itself properly and returns out where it calls codeappgtruncode which drives the main loop.p  pIn the main loop, that driver is called to simply test draw a blank reddish screen. Observing the debug information, the render target in question is operational, created to bind the backbuffer from the swap chain to the pipeline.p  pcoderenderTargetViewcode strongIS NOT NULL. HRESULT is validated to be SOK.strongp  pIf I try to call the Draw function within the D3D11 driver class constructor, it works. strongIt doesnt get deallocated inbetween calls.strong p  pIts like the constructor of the Application class doesnt finish before the run function, if I try to continue without exiting for a few frames forward, the reddish tint of the cleared render target shows. Can someone enlighten me, please Im at the end of my wits.p  pstrongITS NOT NULL. HRESULT is validated to be SOK. There are reports this is fixed in Windows 8, while the Win7 SDK still suffers. Google doesnt yield anything useful, most people forget to create the render target view stays NULL or intellisensemiss OMSetRenderTargets for OMGetRenderTargets.strongp

Negative 82275 pAs part of a program which dynamically loads user inputted strings as Haskell source code, I want to do some preprocessing on the users input before compiling it.p  pOne of the things I would like to be able to do is to search the source for particular function occurrences and add an extra argument to them. So, for example , I might want all occurrences of p  precodeaddThreeNumbers 3 5 codepre  pTo becomep  precodeaddThreeNumbers 3 5 10 codepre  pWhat is the best way of accomplishing such behavior Is it complicated enough to warrant manipulating some sort of abstract syntax tree with functions in the GHC API  Template Haskell Or is this something simple that can be accomplished with some sort of Haskell preprocessing  parsing library If so, what libraries and resources would you recommendp

Negative 82275 pThis is my first post to Stack Overflow, and Im a iOS beginner, so please bear with mep  pI have an example app where I have three UIViews headerView, scrollViewContainer, and bodyView in a parent UIView topView, and all of these views are created in code. The topView is added to a UIScrollView pageScrollView created in storyboard.p  ppageScrollView is filling the full screen of an iPhone, and I used Autolayout. The app only contains the ViewController.h and companioning .mfile seen below, plus Appdelegate.x. I think I used the single view application template to start with. Im using iOS 6 and Xcode 4.6, but I also tried 4.5.p  pIve tried to remove as much as possible of other code thats irrelevant to this problem.p  pThe problem When the app starts it shows all its views correctly, and the scrollView allows to view all three views as intended. But after rotating to landscape, the scrollView somehow offsets the content. For example Stay at top and rotate  content looks OK, but scroll down a bit and rotate makes the top of the content not to show.p  pWhat I have tried Ive searched the net for help, but I havent found anything that seemed to help me. Ive added logging of various data like origin, and contentSize, and also tried to set some of them but without any success. I also used po [[UIWindow keyWindow] autolayoutTrace] to ensure that the constraints are OK.p  pI cant see what Im doing wrong.

Negative 82275 pThe following class is used in an ASP.NET application to read currencies from a database result set and add them up e.g. show totals in US Dollars plus show totals in GB Pounds.  It works in the following mannerp  ol liRead currency ID valueli liIf currency ID exists already, increase the total for that currencyli liIf currency ID does not exist, add it to the list with its valueli liNextli ol  pIt works well using the codeCurrencyIDcode property as the differentiator between each unique currency.  However, it has now become apparent that codeIsoCurrencySymbolcode is also unique for each currency by default, and so codeCurrencyIDcode is not actually needed.p  pSo... I was wondering if it would be possible to inherit from this class and remove any reference to codeCurrencyIDcode, therefore making the codeCompareTocode method use codeIsoCurrencySymbolcode instead.p  pThe trick is to leave the existing class as it is used extensively, but introduce a modified version without codeCurrencyIDcode being needed.

Negative 82275 pIm currently working on a system within which objects animate along a bezier curve. At various, user defined, points on the curve, there can be an event which the animating object has to react to.

The problem I am having is that I cant pass a pointer to the parent object to the child as this will then create a circular dependency, but I also have the problem where I dont know at compilation what type of actions the event will be decorated with.p  pAny ideas about how to overcome this would be greatly appreciated If Ive forgotten any info which might help, Ill try and edit it in.p

Negative 82275 pSo Im trying to parse out JSON files into a tab delimited file. The parsing seems to work fine and all the data is coming through. Although the oddest thing is happening on the output file. I told it to use a tab delimiter and on the output it does use tabs, but it still seems to keep the single quotes.

Negative 82275 pIm using Maven to run integration tests with JUnit in a multimodule project. However, these testcases rely on data that needs to be in Websphere cache to work.

My idea is to abstract that from code, and put it to work using a Maven plugin. Is that possible How do I do thatp

After the process is complete I zip all the files in the working folder This includes the text file that I use for logging. But during the zip process, I always encounter a file in use error. I believe this is not strange because the file is actually in use by the log provider. Is there a way to zip the file along with all the others Or like I proposed in my Title, is there a log provider that can send these errors to a variable and then write them to a file and afterwards zip it. This way I am sure the file is not is use when I am executing the zip task. I am using 7zip for my zip task process.p

Negative 82275 pA few weeks ago I had some problem moving my MySQL database.  I copied it from one server to another.  Now there is something wrong with the privileges.p  pI can create users, databases etc when logged in as root, but I cant change users privileges, which is not good as I dont want to give my script route access.p  pThe error I get is .. p  precodeGRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON  newdatabase .  TO  newuserlocalhost WITH GRANT OPTION    MySQL said   1044  Access denied for user root to database newdatabase  codepre  pSo I did some reading and it appears my informationschema might be bust.  The suggestions were to run flush tables on there which I have done via phpmyadmin and mysqladmin but this hasnt helped.p  pAny ideasp  pThanksp

Negative 82275 pIve done a good bit of searching, but it doesnt seem like this particular brand of form creation is addressed anywhere.p  pIm creating a search page that queries the database for the set of all elements which have attributes at or above a given threshold. Right now I have a simple form that has 5 attributes, which have 5 thresholds each, each with their own checkbox i.e.p  precodeattrib1 X threshold 1 X threshold 2 X threshold 3 X threshold 4 X threshold 5 attrib2 X threshold 1 X threshold 2 X threshold 3 X threshold 4 X threshold 5   ... etc ... codepre  pThe HTML looks something like thisp  precode  ltdiv class forminlinegt     ltlabelgtAttribute 1ltlabelgt     ltlabel classcheckbox inlinegt       ltinput typecheckbox nameattrib 1 value1gt Very Negative     ltlabelgt     ltlabel classcheckbox inlinegt       ltinput typecheckbox nameattribt 1 value2gt Negative     ltlabelgt     ltlabel classcheckbox inlinegt       ltinput typecheckbox nameattrib 1 value3gt Nonfactor     ltlabelgt     ltlabel classcheckbox inlinegt       ltinput typecheckbox nameattrib 1 value4gt Positive     ltlabelgt           ltlabel classcheckbox inlinegt       ltinput typecheckbox nameattrib 1 value5gt Very Positive     ltlabelgt   ltdivgt codepre  pI then search the database using the information in the GET parameters. When I display the search results, whats an elegant way to make sure the checkboxes reflect the search query I expect that the user will check some boxes, look at the results, then check some more to refine the search and I dont want them to have to recheck all the boxes each time they submit a search. p  pIve considered a few way to do this. I could use ifelse statements for each checkbox and fill in the checked attribute appropriately. This would work, but seems inelegant, not very DRY, and would result in a very complex template. Alternatively, in the view I could create a data structure dict of lists or list of tuples, probably dict of lists, which would have either checked or the empty string for each checkbox. This would result in a cleaner template, but I suspect theres a more properly DjangoPythonic way to do this. I also considered a custom form, but that seemed like trying to fit a square peg in a round hole.p  pSo, whats an elegant way to make sure that check boxes on a search form are properly checked based on GET parametersp

Negative 82275 pIm still new at this so I will try to explain my problem the best I can. English is not my first language so I apologize if I use some terms incorrectly.p  pI have a 100 line code that is executed every time a button is pressed. My problem is, I have 20 buttons and they all contain the same code they are only slightly different in means of grabbing info from different source. Is there any way to do this instead of copying the same code too many times.p  pBasically my code is thisp  precode    private void button1Clickobject sender, EventArgs e          file data source url     sourceUrl  www.myurl.com      Grab data     code     code     code     Store data     code     code     code     Write data     code     code     code      codepre  pEvery button has the same code except for the sourceUrl part. If I want to add more buttons I have to copypaste the whole code and my application is starting to get HUGE. Is there any way to shrink the code by only having the code once, and then calling an action or method every time the button is pressed. So instead of having 100 line code multiple time, Ill have one line code for each button and one 100 line code on the top that will be the source for that one line code.p  pThanks in advance p

Negative 82275 pIm busy working on a custom made CMS and website. The CMS and website both share the same datalayer and the datalayer is using an generic repository pattern combined with a Unit of Work store.p  pThe problem occurs when im viewing a page of the website having a simple line of text on it. This line of text is edited in the CMS. When editing this line of text and saving it in the CMS I see the entity being modified and I also see the changes in the database. However after changing this small piece of text through the CMS and then refreshing the website page im still being presented with the old text.p  pThe only way for me to be able to show the new, changed text is to restart IIS of add an space in the web.config and save it so the application pool is recycled. So it seems to me it has something to do with the caching of the entity context.p  pBelow is my generic repository code and my unitofworkstore code.

When the image size is less than the content view bounds the full image is displayed. However, when the image is zoomed the scroll bars activate to allow navigation. This seems simple enough. Below is the view hierarchy I have constructed. Note that the image view is contained inside a custom NSView this is because I have been following the previous question approach where the custom view draws a background, this container view is to the NSScrollViews codedocumentViewcode and than the views where embedded inside the scroll view using the IBs emEmbed Inem command.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comFZlx8.jpg altZooming an image in a scroll view.p  pI have setup the following constraints in IBp  ul liThe image views codeintrinsicContentSizecode is set to the size of the image.

Negative 82275 pIve got another question involving selfreference in Common Lisp. I found a a hrefhttpcodegolf.stackexchange.comquestions12368printeverycharacteryourprogramdoesnthavethread on Stack Exchangea which poses a problem of writing the shortest program that would print all printable ASCII characters NOT present in the programs source code. This got me thinking how to tackle the problem in Common Lisp. I hit against two problems  one probably trivial, the other more trickyp  ul lipFirst is the case of writing a CL script, e.g. starting with codeusrbinenv sbcl scriptcode. I thought that through codeposixargvcode I could access all command line arguments including the name of the called script. I also looked for the equivalent of Bash code0code but could find none. What worked for me in the end is this ugly Bashified SBCL script, which explicitly passes code0code to SBCL and proceeds from thatp  precodebinbash  sbcl script 0 0 exit  defun filestring path   withopenfile stream path     let data makestring filelength stream       readsequence data stream       data  let printable mapcar codechar loop for i from x20 to x7e collect i        absent setdifference          printable          coerce filestring cadr posixargv list   print coerce absent string codepre  pMy question regarding this point is can you think of any way of doing it without relying so heavily on Bash supplying relevant arguments Or, more briefly is there a CL SBCL in particular equivalent of code0codepli lipNow comes the part that Im totally puzzled with. Before resorting to the script approach above I tried to accomplish this goal in a more REPLoriented way. Based on the codeampwholecode specifier in codedefmacrocode and considerations in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions21410189translatingthistocommonlispthis threada Ive tried to get the name of the macro from the codeampwholecode argument and somehow read in its source. And I have absolutely no idea how to do it. So in short given the name of the macro, can I somehow obtain the codedefmacrocode form which defined it And Im talking about a generic solution, rather than parsing the REPL history.p  pEDIT Regarding mbratchs question about use of codemacroexpand1code heres how I do itp  precodedefmacro selfrefer ampwhole body   macroexpand1 ,body codepre  pWith this call Im able to obtain codeSELFREFERcode by calling codeSELFREFERcode.

Negative 82275 pstrongIve recently taken on a VPS Ubuntu 12.04 to host a few websites with domains and have recently set up PostfixDovecot to act as a mail server for the sites as well. The name server records are pointing to my registrars nameservers.strongp  pI have a few domains domain1.com, domain2.com, domain3.com with their A records pointing to the IP of my VPS, which Ive set up with name based virtualhosts for apache.p  pI imagined that once it was set up correctly, I would be able to enter mail.domain1.com as my pop3imapsmtp mail server on an email client, along with my username and password. It would be fine for this to be the same for the other domains too. p  pCould someone tell me what the correct A and MX DNS records should be for this and how I should set my hostname on my vps and in settings for postfixdovecotp  pemFor instance Ive set my vps hostname as domain1.com and I put the same in the postfixdovecot config, but wondered if I should have put mail.domain1.com Do I set CNAMEs for mail, imap, pop, smtp to point to an MX record or an A record so that the server can be reached at all of thememp  pMany thanks for any help you can offer p

Negative 82275 pFirst of all I am very new to Python  this is my 2nd month of programming only a few weeks with PySideSQLAlchemyso please be gentle.p  pI am developing a plant management app and have a form with a bunch of check boxes that relate to months of the year when seeds can be sown and another bunch of checkboxes representing planting zones. I developed the form with QTDesigner.p  pI am collecting the object names and state of the check boxes and storing them in a dictionary using the checkbox object name as the key, and the checkstate true or fals as the item and then storing that in a sqlite db via sqlalchemy using PickleType for the Column.p  pI want to read a record from the sqlite db and restore all the checkboxes to the state they were in when saved.p  pMy problem is that the key from the dict which is the checkbox object name is a string.

Negative 82275 pI am using the Apache Http Client in a Scala application.p  pThe application is fairly high throughput with high parallelism.p  pI am not sure but I think perhaps I am leaking connections.  It seems that whenever the section of code that uses the client gets busy, the application become unresponsive.  My suspicion is that I am leaking sockets or something which is then causing other aspects of the application to stop working.  It may also not be leaking connections so much as not closing them fast enough.p  pFor more context, occasionally, certain actions lead to this code being executed hundreds of times a minute in parallel.  When this happens the Rest API Spray of the application becomes unresponsive. There are other areas of the application that operate in high parallelism as well and those never cause a problem with the applications responsiveness.p  pCutting back on the parallelism of this section of code does seem to alleviate the problem but isnt a viable long term solution.p  pAm I forgetting to configure something, or configuring something incorrectlyp  pThe code I am using is something like thisp  precodeclass SomeClass    val connectionManager  new PoolingHttpClientConnectionManager   connectionManager.setDefaultMaxPerRoute50   connectionManager.setMaxTotal500   val httpClient  HttpClients.custom.setConnectionManagerconnectionManager.build    def postData      val post  new HttpPosthttpSomeUrl  Typically this URL is fixed.

I have tried adjusting the DefaultMaxPerRoute and the MaxTotal to a variety of values with no noticeable effect.  It seems like I am missing something and as a result the connections are not being reused, but I cant find any documentation that suggests what I am missing.  It is critical that these connections get reused.p  pstrongEDIT 2strongp  pWith further investigation, using lsof p, I can see that if I set the MaxPerRoute to 10, there are in fact 10 connections being listed as ESTABLISHED.  I can see that the port numbers do not change.  This seems to imply to me that in fact it is reusing the connections.p  pWhat that doesnt explain is why I am still leaking connections in this code  The reused connections and leaked connections found with netstat a showing up in TIMEWAIT status share the same base url.  So they are definitely related.  Is it possible perhaps that I am reusing the connections but then somehow not properly closing the responsep  pstrongEDIT 3strongp  pLocated the source of the TIMEWAIT leak.  It was in an unrelated section of code.  So it wasnt anything to do with the HttpClient.

Negative 82275 pI know keepalives are great for eliminating the TCP connection penalty when we have lots of rapidsuccession requests from a client browser, but what about the case of something like a JSONP web service  This has different characteristics than a web page loadp  ol lipThe client browser will typically make 1 request at a time.  Few to no ancillary rapidfire requests for referenced files like in HTML.pli lipThe requests will occasionally be in succession, but more usually a few seconds or even minutes apart.  Setting keepalive very low like many advise isnt always a reasonable setting.  Apaches current default is 5s a hrefhttphttpd.apache.orgdocs2.4modcore.htmlkeepalivetimeout relnofollowhttphttpd.apache.orgdocs2.4modcore.htmlkeepalivetimeouta, which is lower than 1.3s 15s a hrefhttphttpd.apache.orgdocs1.3modcore.htmlkeepalivetimeout relnofollowhttphttpd.apache.orgdocs1.3modcore.htmlkeepalivetimeouta.  Both are emmuchem lower than a minute.  This could be because 15 was too high, or broadband mitigated latency  or both.  The current 5s would probably accomplish nothing good for this scenario.pli ol  pWe can assume we do not hog a Linux task per connection  a thread or process  while the socket is left open in idleWAITblocked keepalive state, but would it be a good idea to just leave sockets like that dangling open for a few minutes  Options to make that happen would be Nginx, Apache Event MPM, etc. that use underlying event based features in nix like kqueue or epoll.  Assume dynamic content is fulfilled in another task pool and once done, the keepalived socket will be just an open file descriptor.p  pIs it really just a file descriptor  How much does it cost the linux kernel for example to track more of them in an more or less idle state.  Will this cause a webserver to run out of FDs or starve it in any way  This cost should be weighed against the cost of building up another TCP connection for a subsequent request from scratch.p  pa hrefhttpgabenell.blogspot.com201011connectionkeepalivetimeoutsfor.html relnofollowhttpgabenell.blogspot.com201011connectionkeepalivetimeoutsfor.htmla amp a hrefhttpblog.fastmail.fm20110628httpkeepaliveconnectiontimeouts relnofollowhttpblog.fastmail.fm20110628httpkeepaliveconnectiontimeoutsa document that everything except Safari will hold it  1 minute.  a hrefhttpwww.semicomplete.combloggeekeryssllatency.html relnofollowhttpwww.semicomplete.combloggeekeryssllatency.htmla documents TCP latencies for HTTP and HTTPS.p

Negative 82275 pI have an app that uses GPS for regular updates. It used to be the case that when the device was put to sleep screen turned off, screen timeout etc, the location updates kept on coming through. This was on an HTC Desire running 2.2.p  pI need that behaviour for various reasons.p  pHowever, now being tested on an HTC Desire S running 4.0.4, and what seems to happen is that updates continue 1sec for about 5 seconds after entering sleep mode, but then stop. However, exactly the same code running on a Google Nexus 7 running 4.4.2, and the updates keep coming through.p  pThe activity life cycle seems to be doing all the right things onPause when entering sleep, onResume when exiting sleep, but on the Desire S, the location updates stop.p  pWhilst no doubt it is more power efficient to turn them off, I need them on. The behaviour seems OS andor device dependant. How can I achieve thatp  pEdit actually Ive found that location updates do keep coming, just much less frequently than requested.p

Negative 82275 pIm new to web application development, and aiming at designing an application which will serve both browsers and mobile devices which will consume REST services to communicate with the server.p  pFor this I think of creating 2 separate layers for web and rest. I follow the spring io getting started guides full tutorials a hrefhttpspring.ioguidesgs relnofollowhttpspring.ioguidesgsa, which use an architecture that holds a domain package within the rest layer which constructs the objects that will be sent as replies to rest requests.p  pIn another web tutorial they have a similar package under web layer for handling the domain objects prior to displaying them.p  pI read this question and if I follow the general guidelines in the answer, I would implement separate domain packages since even if the view layer uses REST, there are still some differences which might be a source of maintenance problems should I decide to change something in the future a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions23308241bestpracticemultilayerarchitectureanddtosBest Practice  Multi Layer Architecture and DTOsap  pMy question is regarding an application that has both, should the web layer hold DTOs like the rest one, or is it a good practice to have the views call the rest services or use the same rest.domain.POJOs and extract these POJOs from that package to a common onep  pThanks.p

Negative 82275 pThe problem I am writing a program that will test a players reflexes using a random letter Q,W,E,R. The idea for the end program is that, when the player presses space, a timer will begin. Then the program will show them a random letter Q,W,E,R. When they press the correct key and then press enter, it will print correct and show them the next letter. If they press the wrong key, then press enter, the program will return incorrect. After ten letters, it will divide their total time by ten to give them their reflex time. I have not added the timing part yet because of the problem, that it only prints Correct or Incorrect once every 3 times. The other times seem to be ignored and are not added to the score either.

Negative 82275 pOkay, using Scala Play Framework I have an Action method in my Application Controller that accesses a database for a specific serial and sends a JSON object using Okjson, which can be accessed through the route codeGET jsonserial controllers.Application.getDataserial Stringcode. This part works I am able to retrieve a unformatted JSON objects for specific serial numbers going directly through localhostjsonemserialem. p  pIn my views, there is a page for editing this database information. There is an HTML select drop down with a list of serial numbers, and when one of them is selected Id like to send an AJAX request with that serial number to json and get a JSON object in return. Once I have the JSON object, the forms should be populated with that information so the users know what they are editing. p  pSo essentially my question is how can I use AJAXjQuery to request a JSON object over HTTP using route jsonserial so that I can populate an HTML form with the various fields in the JSON object when a serial is selected from a drop downp  pLet me know if anything is unclear or too ambiguous Thanksp  pEDIT Some Codep  precodeval getDataserial String  Action   val scInfo  some database query val ctrlInfo  another database query val json JsValue  Json.obj         name gt scInfo0.1,         notes gt scInfo0.2,         ctrl1 gt Json.objname gt scInfo0.3,             port gt scInfo0.4,             apc gt scInfo0.5,         ctrl2 gt Json.objname gt ctrlInfo0.1,             port gt ctrlInfo0.2,             apc gt ctrlInfo0.3,         rack gt scInfo0.6,         comtrol gt scInfo0.7           Okjson  codepre  pThis is a picture of what the form will roughly look like I figured seeing the actual page was easier than reading the markupp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comBZAcW.png altFormp  pSo when a Storage Center is selected, that number is sent via AJAX to codejsonserialcode and should request a JSON object as a result, which will then populate the other fields in the form.p  pEDIT 2p  pHeres the markup for the view.

Now to where the issue arises. If I unremm the commented sections of code and remove the http.get section, then my issue comes to light.

Negative 82275 pallp  pThis issue comes from my currently working C project.  In solution, it includes three projects, one is UI project, another is interface project, the third is component project. The basic idea of my solution is UI project can dynamic load the component DLL which inherit interface defined in interface project. And in interface project, I defined two classes, one is a interface which is used by UI project to dynamic load DLL, and this interface defines all exposure entities in component object. And besides this interface, theres another abstract component core class which inherit public interface, and it includes all common operations in actual component object. I draw a plot following to describe my explanation before.p  pUI Class  Interface lt Abstract Component Core lt Actual Componentp  pAnd in my design, I use C BackgroundWorker in abstract component core object. And BackgroundWorker contains two event ProgressChanged and RunWorkerCompleted. In my design idea, these two events should be registered by UI Class. For example, UI class can register its operation when components BackgroundWorkers progress changing or operation finishing. And another thing is that I dont want to expose BackgroundWorker object in Component Core to UI class, so the BackgroundWorker object is defined in abstract component core, not in interface. So in my raw design, I create two events in interface which accepts same event handler as BackgroundWorkers two events. As followingp  precodeevent EventHandlerltProgressChangedEventArgsgt ProcessChanged event EventHandlerltRunWorkerCompletedEventArgsgt RunWorkerCompleted codepre  pAnd in later some places, I will assign these two event handlers to BackgroundWorkers actual events. Code as followingp  precodemBackgroundWorker.ProgressChanged  new ProgressChangedEventHandler  this.ProcessChanged  mBackgroundWorker.RunWorkerCompleted  new RunWorkerCompletedEventHandler  this.RunWorkerCompleted  codepre  pBut I dont like this design. Because the user of componet here is UI class assign its event handler to components event, and it real operation, component will add  this event handler to BackgroundWorkers event handler. So this cause BackgroundWorker will have several same event handler if UI running again and again. The idea situation for me is that 1BackgroundWorkers event only can contain one event handler 2When user assign event handler to component cores own event, then it can transfer this event handler to BackgroundWorkers event at the same timep  pAnyone can give me some workable design idea Thanksp

For examplep  precodecreate table a x int not null primary key create table b x int not null primary key, y int not null alter table a add foreign key x references b x codepre  pNow, assuming you set up some data in these two tables, you can get a certain number of rows from ap  precodeselect x from a codepre  pAdding a join to b following the foreign key does not change thisp  precodeselect a.x from a join b on a.x  b.x codepre  pHowever, that is not true of joins in general, which may filter out some rows or by Cartesian product add morep  precodeselect a.x from a join b on a.x  b.x and b.y  42  probably gives fewer rows  select a.x from a join b on a.x  b.y  probably gives more rows codepre  pWhen reading SQL code there is no obvious way to tell whether a codejoincode is the keypreserving kind, which may add extra columns but does not change the number of rows returned, or whether it has other effects.  Over time I have developed a coding convention which I mostly stick top  ul liif a keypreserving join, use codejoincodeli liif wanting to filter rows, put the filter condition in the codewherecode clauseli liif wanting more rows, sometimes codecross joincode for Cartesian product is the clearest wayli ul  pThese are usually just style issues, since you can often put a predicate into either the codejoincode clause or the codewherecode clause, for example.p  pstrongMy questionstrongp  pIs there some way to have these keypreserving joins statically checked by the database server when the query is compiled  I understand that the query optimizer already knows that a join on a foreign key will always find exactly one row in the table pointed to by the foreign key.  But I would like to tag it in my SQL code for the benefit of human readers.  For example, suppose the new syntax codefkjoincode is used for a join following a foreign key.  Then the following SQL fragments will give errors or notp  precodea fkjoin b on a.x  b.x  OK  a fkjoin b on a.x  b.x and b.y  42  Error, join can fail due to extra predicate  a fkjoin b on a.x  b.y  Error, no foreign key from a.x to b.y codepre  pThis would be a useful check for me when writing the SQL, and also when returning to read it later.  I understand and accept that changing the foreign keys in the database would change what SQL is legal under this scheme  to me, that is a desired outcome, since if a necessary FK ceases to exist then the keypreserving semantics of the query are no longer guaranteed, and Id like to find out about it.p  pPotentially, there could be some external SQL static checker tool that does the work, and special comment syntax could be used rather than a new keyword.  The checker tool would need access to the database schema to see what foreign keys exist, but it would not need to actually execute the query.p  pIs there something that does what I want  I am using MSSQL 2008 R2.  Microsoft SQL Server for the pedanticp

Negative 82275 pAfter searching alot on Internet we have came to one conclusion in order to ensure an persist xmpp connection with xmpp server we have to create an service,p  pWe have created one  which uses aSmack library to connect with xmpp server and it is working fine with mobile and wifi network.p  pEvery time you make something design approach always matter, aSmack have this reconnection mechanism already implicitly implemented in there library which listen to connection and if connection drops aSmack try to reconnect with xmpp server at some interval of time.p  pOur use case scenariobr                        INTERNET connectivity can be because of wifi or data network,here if connection go is ideal state of someone turn off screen cpu goes to sleep now any data is sent to server on this connection there will be no response because server is no more listening to client ,on client side XMPP connection is already in connected mode connection listener is not detecting any disconnection from server,so here flow gets complected.  p  pAfter searching on INTERNET we found that possible solution to solve this is to ping server after a fix we are using 1 min as fix period,after ping fail detected ,we have implemented reconnection mechanism same as smackidea taken from aSmack reconnection mechanism itselfby making use of timer task.p  pProblem only problem we have is bratty draining ,if user is still connected with INTERNET and reconnection interval increases it will drain batty.p  p1.

Negative 82275 pIs there a way I can pass Snap.svg a jQuery object say, a collection of all codeltlinegtcode elements and convert it so that Snap.svg can use it eg. animate itp  pExamplep  precodethis is jQuery code or Javascript querySelectorAll if you like var lines  line   there is some step missing here that converts  the lines variable to a usable Snap object   this is Snap.svg code lines.forEachfunctione      e.animate x1 80, y1 120 , 3000  codepre  pThe reason I cant use the Snap.svg native codeselectAllcode function is that Im using a custom SVG namespace to save additional attribute data to the codeltlinegtcode elements. Id rather use some Snap.svg code akin to codesvg.selectAllcustomnsvar13code but that doesnt work because querySelectorAll does not support custom namespaces and with jQuery or plain Javascript I could work around that. Any help is appreciated.p
Negative 82275 pI am in the process of replacing a legacy web application written in ASP.NET 1.0. My plan is to rebuild a new GUI using MVC5 on top of the existing database schema. As part of the process, I migrated the entire database from SQLServer 2000 to SQLServer 2014 and pointed the same web instance at the new DB server. p  pAlthough queries on the new server run much faster, the DB upgrade has caused our website to slow way down. I traced the slowness to a DataAdapter.Fill call. When connecting to SQLServer 2014, the call from the web app takes about 10 seconds instead of 3 seconds with the old DB Server 3 times slower. The underlying sproc is very fast so thats not the bottleneck.p  pThe new DB server is located on the same network, so latency should not an issue. The Web server can ping both the old and the DB Servers in less than 10 ms.p  pAny idea why the DB upgrade would cause such a dramatic slowdownp
Negative 82275 pI updated to OSX 10.9.5 and realized that one function pipeline that I used flawlessly is now broken.p  pI send a wakeonlan magic packet to my OSX from my Raspberry Pi which successfully wakes up the OSX, but unlike before the iMacs display stays dark. Previously the display also brightened up. The problem is not that particularly, but that when I run an applescript through SSH the iMac goes back to sleep by itself in the middle of running and I have to wake it up again to finish the interrupted script. I have setup my energy saving to Never so it shouldnt do that.p  pI even tried running a script that actually sets the brightness of iMacs display to highest, but that doesnt wake up the display either.p  pOnly when I take a VNC connection or move the local USB mouse the display wakes up and OSX wont go back to sleep by itself.p

Negative 82275 pI was trying to read the gmail mail box using codeimapheaderscode and codeimapheadercode function available in php, it was working fine without any problems. Here in gmail codeimapheadercode function gives the count of only unread mails and codeimapheadersmessagenumbercode function would take the message number as input and would return the header information of the mail. Executing codeimapfetchstructurecode and codeimapfetchbodycode the message would be marked as read and that message would not come in the next run, since it was marked as read.p  pNow when I am using office365 account the function codeimapheadercode is returning the count of all mails in the inbox and not the unread mails count, also as contrary in previous case codeimapfetchstructurecode and codeimapfetchbodycode are not marking the mail as read and hence the read mails also get tracked in the next job cycles.p  pAny inputs on this is really helpfull.....Thanksp

Negative 82275 pIve a problem with the Fetch as Google tool for my ajax website. My site is a little old, ajax website written using jquery. The developers who have made it havent used the Hash Fragments. But theyve defined static routes and the ajax calls are used only within the views to load the page content. Now I wanted to make this specific page Google friendly, and Ive already implemented what Google asks a hrefhttpssupport.google.comwebmastersanswer174992hlen relnofollowherea.p  pSince my site is not a full Single page app, Ive selected the third step directly.

So it should be crawlable, rightp  pHere is an example a hrefhttpexample.comtopicHealthConditionsandDiseases relnofollowhttpexample.comtopicHealthConditionsandDiseasesap  pthis page uses an ajax call to get details from the server and update the view.

The fetching keeps saying pending and ends with an error it takes a long time to show as Error, but nothing mentioned about the error. Ive confirmed that both these versions are working by manually visiting each url. and before I implement this, the Fetch tool actually showed the image of the page without content. So now I was expecting to see it with content. But no idea why its taking a long time  it gives the error. p  pCan somebody please where Ive done wrong Is it correct what Im thinking about the escapedfragment p  pThank you in advance, Looking forward for tips from you all.p

Negative 82275 pHopefully someone can help. I have been pulling my hair out on this one Below is some of the control pad code from my Sprite Kit game which uses codeapplyForcecode to move the hero ship. I like how the controls and movement feel, its got some nice drift, etc... However I have inconsistent results on the animationmovement it produces. Sometimes about half the time the animation is perfectly smooth and looks correct. The rest of the time the ship movement animation stutters at different intensities. p  pThe monsters and pickups in the game run on various paths with codeSKActioncode. Their animations do not suffer when the issue happens to the hero ship and I typically see it happening with a sold 60.0 fps in the debug, which makes me think it is not a frame drop issues. My memory usage is consistent and I dont see any large spikes.p  pWhen the bug happens it is always apparent from the beginning of the scene it never starts happening after I start with a smooth movement making me think its something with the initial force or multiple forces at once and continues to happen until I restart the level or pause and unpause the game, at which point I get a new behavior of either perfectly smooth animation, or glitchy animation.p  pMy draws and nodes are pretty optimized with atlases and preloading and even when I turn most everything in the game off everything but the ship and the control pad I still experience this issue with codeapplyForcecode on the ship.p  pI have noticed that I experience this more often when plugged into Xcode, often when Im logging but not always, and especially while running instruments.p  pMy ControlPad calls back to the game scene with a delegatep  precode Game Scene   interface GameScene  ltSKPhysicsContactDelegate, ControlPadDelegategt  ...   voidcreateHero      self.heroShip  [Hero createHeroInFrameself.frame]     [self.gameObject addChildself.heroShip]     self.heroShip.position  CGPointMakeself.heroShip.size.width, self.frame.size.height  2    Move Hero By X And Y   voidmoveHeroByXfloatmoveByX andYfloatmoveByY      [self.heroShip.physicsBody applyForceCGVectorMakemoveByX, moveByY]    Control Pad Class   static float const sensitivity    10 static float const maxMove        10  interface ControlPad   Touch Points property nonatomic CGPoint navPadTouchPrevious property nonatomic CGPoint navPadTouchCurrent   Touch Instances property nonatomic UITouch  navPadTouchInstance  implementation ControlPad   idinitWithSizeCGSizesize  ...

Ive successfully used autolayout to constrain the top right label to the top and right. I have an explicit width set on the top left layout so that if the user name is too long, it will truncate before the top right label. strongFirst question Is it possible to make the width dynamic such that the top right label stays plastered to the top and right part of the cell, and the top left label truncates if it is within a centimeter from the top right label This is important for different screen sizes.strong p  pNext I have successfully established the dynamic height label 3rd one down from the top to have a width of the entire cell by constraining it to the left and right margins. I tried constraining it on the bottom also, but this is where I run into my huge issue. The text leaks into the next cell if it is too long.

Were considering the collapse unintentional and using standard height instead.strongp  pHowever, when I place that code into my View Controller, the label does have a dynamic height, but because there is a constant height to each row, it leaks through. I dont know how to mitigate this because without that line, the warning as stated uses the standard height instead, which lumps all my labels and buttons together all on top of themselves and then for some reason, the dynamic label text no longer has a dynamic height, but instead conforms to one line.p  pHow do I fix this issue Ive been puzzled and stuck on this for a long while.p

Lets say in the xib, FooView has only one subview, FooLabel. FooLabel has a top, leading, trailing, and bottom constraint of 0 it fills the FooView, and its number of lines is set to 0. What measures do I have to take so that instead of the FooLabel shrinking to fit the frame of FooView, FooView grows in height to fit the full content of FooLabel.p  pAs the code stands now, the width and x values are set correctly, but the height gets set to the value FooViewController.xib defines. I understand why this is happening, as Im not doing anything to tell it to resize based on the label content  and thats basically my question how do I have the view resize in this wayp

How will Ember submit requestsstrongp  pIm quite new to REST in general. I think Ember simply use the appropriate verb for the action it wants GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.

Negative 82275 pI want to allow users to request webpages of my website both directly from the server or using links, which will be handled by Backbones router.p  pWhen a user requests a webpage directly from the server, a full page is served with html, head, body, stylesheets and scripts.p  pOn the other hand when a user requests a webpage by clicking on a link, only the relevant part of the page is requested and then inserted in the correct place, and other elements of the webpage remain untouched.p  pBy eminserting in the correct placeem I mean creating a View once a particular route is reached. The view is then initialized and calls its render method to fetch the relevant part of the webpage and inserts it into DOM using codeel.htmlcontentcode.p  pBut I do not want to call the views render method when a webpage was fetched directly from the server, because all needed content has already been rendered, and rerendering it only causes some uiflickering effects. p  pIs there some common way to let Views know that they shouldnt render themselves, because the fully rendered webpage has been fetched from the serverp  pI could pass a flag like codeclientSideNavigation  truecode to the router, everytime a link is clicked, which then will be passed to views by the router so that they know whether to render the content or not. p  pBut it does not work when user uses aa backfoward buttons.p  pI could also check in a view if within its codeelcode there is some particular element that should be present on this webpage  for instance if I had a view called codeCatsViewcode I could check if codecatsboxcode is within its codeelcode element. But it involves some more DOM manipulations, which I would prefer to avoid.p

Apperently when it loses connection it skips to the next item on the list, and what I want to do is to rebuffer the current channel even if the connection is slow.p  pNow for the mkv and mp4 Im using the roVideoScreen, the problem is that with HD content more than 420 it buffers a alot, and I would like to buffer only once even if it takes longer.p  pAny help would be appreciatedp

Negative 82275 pWe are currently in the process of upgrading from TFS 2008 to TFS 2012.  When TFS 2008 was set up, the people involved didnt understand a lot of what the work item fields were for, and we ended up with very heavily customised templates and in fact lost a lot of default fields.  As part of the upgrade to 2012 we are trying to return to the out of the box templates as much as possible to ensure we get to use as many of the features as possible, however there are a small number of custom fields that we need to include for reporting purposes.p  pOur product development process involves a roadmap for upcoming releases which includes new work as well as bug fixes.  When a bug is assigned to be worked on by the developers we would like to be able to choose which release were targeting the fix for  as far as I can see, Iteration is best suited for this.  At the point the bug is closed though, we would also like to track what release it was actually fixed in, since things often get bumped from one release to the next if higher priority bugs or change requests come in, but this is where we come unstuck since I cant seem to assign Iteration to both fields such that the two show different values.p  pIf possible we would prefer not to have global lists that have to be constantly updated with release numbers across our product range we have around 8 different products which are constantly in development, each with their own release numbers, and leaving one of them as a text field leaves open the possibility that we will get inconsistencies in what people enter, eg 1.01 versus 1.1 which will show up in reporting as 2 different releases.  As the fields are just looking up a set of values in the background, is there no way that the iteration list can be used twice  Or does someone have an alternative suggestion as to how we get round thisp
Negative 82275 pIve searched SO on how to format numbers with currency or percent symbols while using textwatcher, but still cant get things to work.

Negative 82275 pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions307179whatisjavascriptshighestintegervaluethatanumbercangotowithoutlosinThis questiona asks about the highest number in JavaScript without losing precision. Here, I ask about the highest representable number in JavaScript. Some answers to the other question reference the answer to this question, but they do not answer that question, so I hope I am safe asking here.p  pI tried to find the answer, but I got lost halfway through. The highest number representable in JavaScript seems to be somewhere between 21023 and 21024. I went further in the iojs REPL withp  precodevar highest  Math.pow2, 1023 forlet i  1022 i gt someNumber i    highest  Math.pow2, someNumber  codepre  pThe highest number here seems to be when codesomeNumbercode is between 969 and 970. This means it is between 21023  21022  ...  2970 and 21023  21022  ...  2969. Im not sure how to go further without running out of memory andor waiting years for a loop or function to finish.p  pWhat is the highest number representable in JavaScript Does JavaScript store all digits of this number, or just some, because whenever I see numbers of 1021 or higher they are represented in scientific notation Why can JavaScript represent these extremely high numbers, especially if it can remember all the digits Isnt JavaScript a base 64 languagep  pFinally, why is this the highest representable number I am asking because it is not an integer exponent of 2. Is it because it is a floating point number If we took the highest floating point number, would that be related to some exponent of 2p

Negative 82275 pI have a class with many switch statements in it. The code looks very ugly to me but I cant figure out how to fix it. If somebody could suggest a design pattern or a trick that cleans this up that would be great. Below is a abbreviated version of the Class with some annotations for context.p  precode   Slides a desktop Notification from the edge of the screen into the desktop by some margin.    public class SlideManager extends NotificationManager       Location enum provided below for reference     public enum Location          NORTH, NORTHEAST, EAST, SOUTHEAST, SOUTH, SOUTHWEST, WEST, NORTHWEST          private Location mloc  the corner  edge of the screen where the Notification should appear      A Screen abstracts away the padding logic.      The idea was that you would just give it a padding and I could reuse      it later in all my NotificationManagers to give me the x and y for a Notification Location later.     private Screen mstandardScreen     private Screen mnoPaddingScreen      the direction that the Notification should slide in from.      For instance, if we had our Notification show up on the center east side of the screen,      it should slide in from the edge towards the west until it was a suitable margin away from the edge of the screen.     private SlideDirection mdirection     private double mslideSpeed      this is a flag to signal when the user has overridden the default SlideDirection calculation.      If the user constructs the SlideManager without calling setSlideDirection later,      this will be false. However, if the user does setSlideDirection      we want to avoid changing that automatically if the user later calls setLocation.     private boolean moverwrite      public enum SlideDirection          NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST                    mstandardScreen  Screen.standard         mnoPaddingScreen  Screen.withPadding0         mslideSpeed  300         moverwrite  false           public SlideManager          mloc  Location.NORTHEAST         recalculateSlideDirection           public SlideManagerLocation loc          mloc  loc         recalculateSlideDirection                  Sets the location where the Notifications show up.       If the user has not explicitly given a SlideDirection, this will also recalculate the SlideDirection.        For example, if the user moves the Notification spawn location from East to West        we want to change the SlideDirection from West to East, respectively.             param loc           public void setLocationLocation loc          mloc  loc         if moverwrite             recalculateSlideDirection                  Sets the direction that the Notification should slide in from.             param slide           public void setSlideDirectionSlideDirection slide          mdirection  slide         moverwrite  true           private void recalculateSlideDirection          switch mloc           The tricky part is when the user wants the Notification to appear in a corner of the screen.          If this werent the case, it would make no sense for a user to set          his own SlideDirection because the SlideDirection for Location.          EAST would always be West, Location.NORTH would always be SOUTH, etc.          But for the literal corner cases I want to somehow give a way for the user to have a preference.          For example, in the top right corner the Notification could either slide in from the right or from the top.          By default I choose the top, but I want the user to be able to change this and also have that choice remembered if the Location changes.         case NORTHWEST             mdirection  SlideDirection.SOUTH             break         case NORTH             mdirection  SlideDirection.SOUTH             break         case NORTHEAST             mdirection  SlideDirection.SOUTH             break         case EAST             mdirection  SlideDirection.WEST             break         case SOUTHEAST             mdirection  SlideDirection.NORTH             break         case SOUTH             mdirection  SlideDirection.NORTH             break         case SOUTHWEST             mdirection  SlideDirection.NORTH             break         case WEST             mdirection  SlideDirection.EAST             break                             When a Notification is added it should slide in from the edge towards an area slightly off the edge.

Negative 82275 pWhat Id like to do is to be able to add a tag to commits which Jenkins is building from. Right now I tag commits with the Jenkins build number but I want to also add in the app version as listed in the Info.plist CFBundleVersion in front of that.p  pWhat I want to know is, how I can grab that value using Jenkins or otherwise and be able to use that as a parametervariable within Jenkinsp  pIve seen references to using plistbuddy to set this value so I would assume theres a way to use that to get the same value. Though how and how to get that to where I can use it in Jenkins I dont know.p  hr  pFor further clarification I am using Git Publisher in Jenkins to create a tag and push it with this formatp  pjenkinsbuildBUILDNUMBERp  pThis results in a tag on the commit in git like this  jenkinsbuild303p  pWhat I want, assuming my app is currently at version 3.5 is a tag that reads  jenkinsbuild3.5303p

Negative 82275 pWe are going to have multiple apps an ASP.NET MVC website application and iOS, Android apps.  We need all versions of our software to allow users to register and login, no matter what version of the app they are using.  So Ive been tasked with creating an ASP.NET Web API REST service that will register and authenticate users and return a token.  As a web developer, Ill also be working on the MVC site that will call this web service.  All the examples I see use GoogleFacebook to authenticate users, but I dont want that.  I want to use my web service instead, where the data for users will be stored in a SQL Server DB.p  pHow do I go about creating this web service  Is there any sample code out there that does this  I dont care about Facebook or Google logins...our logins are internal only and should be stored in SQL.  Please help p  pAlso, should the authentication web service be separate from the web service that returns report data within the consuming apps  Id prefer the service to handle it all as the database will be the same.p

Negative 82275 pId like to try integrating Elastix callcenter with a backoffice system. The backoffice system makes a list of calls to be made available to the callcenter via a REST interface. I would need to create a script on the Elastix server which adds the calls from the backoffice system to the Elastix call list i.e. rather than uploading a call file manually, I want the calls to be fetched automatically from the backoffice system. I see that Elastix is using a MySQL database, so my question is whether I can simply write to this database inserting calls from a, say, scheduled Python script.p  pAnyone with experience of this type of integration of Elastix with backoffice systems If theres a better or more standard way to do it, Id be happy to hear about it too...p

Negative 82275 pI do run a web application, which I stripped to the max to avoid a high tcpsndbuf values. Still a failcnt on tcpsndbuf will be reached after a few days and very, very little traffic.p  pI initially thought it is an application container issue as described in this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions31979522unabletofillpoolnobufferspaceavailablethreada.p  pThe tcpsndbuf values rise and rise. It seems as the buffer value is never released completely. Thus, it continuously increases until it breaches the limit and demands its tribute of 100 CPU throttle.p  pHowever, after ruling out different sources like hibernate configs, mysql driver error, I want to focus on openvz managed by Parallel PleskPower Panel and the apache proxymod.p  pThe reason why I belive it, is the fact that numeruous process of codeusrsbinapache2 k startcode are listed in the process list Parallels Power Panel, Processesp  pI use the proxymod to route port 80 to my application server which is on a different port but the same host.p  pHow can I analyse the socket states in detail E.g. what buffer is locked by which application, when has it been assigned Can I see the proxymod connections Is that type of data available Any other hints on tcpsndbuf provoking a max CPU load are highly welcome.p

Negative 82275 pFriday I spent some time refactoring an AngularJS application that Ive been working on for the last few weeks. My refactoring centered on 4 pretty specific areasp  ol liwrapping all of my AngularJS code in IIFEs,li lirearranging my controller code so that I eliminated virtual functions in favor of assigning functions to members by the same name in my controller, li licleaning up any issues by adding use strict to all of my js files in the appropriate places andli lieliminating the use of a global app variable. All went well and introduced fewer issues than I originally expected.li ol  pAfter I completed the above work, I was astonished by the performance boost it apparently gave my app. The app uses Angular Material fairly heavily and the AM components that seemed to be somewhat sluggish were noticeably snappier. Is this type of performance boost to be expected p

Negative 82275 pIm new using d3 but it is kind of making me crazy with something that seems so simple, basically Im using the partition graph from d3, my idea is that when I click an element I will change it fill color to red, thats not a problem, pretty easy, however I want to also change all of its descendants fill color to red. I can access the children data and children of children data and would only need a recursive function to change the color, however what I cannot seem to access is the rect element associated with each child. Ive tried the d3.selectchild.stylefill, red function but it does not work, Im guessing Im doing something wrong but can someone point me in the right directionp  pI have this locally but I am basically using this same example I added jquery to my solution a hrefhttpmbostock.github.iod3talk20111018partition.html relnofollowhttpmbostock.github.iod3talk20111018partition.htmlap  pIn there, using firebug I set a breakpoint in partition.html on line 84. To hit that breakpoint I just click on a blue box in the graph and from there what I want is to be able to select the rect or the g elements associated to the one I clicked.p  pAgain, I now I can do d.children[0] to get the data for the first child, but I do not know from there how to accessedit it css to change the color of its fill.p  pAny help will be appreciated, also, I know I might not have given the best explanation, Ill gladly answer any question or try to clarify any confusion.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 82275 pThe purpose is to do a fun animation on mouse hover, for the background of the landing page of a creative website. The background is entirely made of polygons, which makes it harder to create, I think.p  pIm not sure if I should do the animation using css or jquery, nor do I know how to display the background  should I use svg, images, or css  p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comhmDwT.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comhmDwT.png altThe animationap  pSo, onhover, a polygon should display a new backgroundcolor, and on mouseout, it should return to the initial one  which is white.p  pThe cool thing would be to launch a function on hover that would display a color with a gradient or something similar, so that each polygons background slowly disappears... Like, from blue on hover, to blue with 50 opacity, to white.p  pI am quite new with jQuery, so Im not a pro really..  Dont pay attention to the fact that it is displayed on an iPad, just see it as if it were a desktop regular computer.p  pDo you guys have any idea on how to code this  p
