Positive 1281 pI am trying to include a modular thirdparty library a hrefhttpwellcaffeinated.netPhysicsJS relnofollowPhysicsJSa into my webpack project. This library is AMD and CommonJSfriendly, and has wellformed submodules that I want to access. However it is primarily structured for RequireJS, via its codepackagescode definition spec in coderequire.configcode, so the entry point isnt a standard codeindex.jscode. Instead the entry point is codephysicsjs.jscode. p  pIn other words, I cant seem to figure out how to configure webpack to resolve both the librarys main file and its submodules. It just seems like if the librarys entry point isnt codeindex.jscode and it has submodules, you are out of luck, and I just cant believe thats correct, so I must be missing something.p  pSo, how can the following statements be made to resolvep  precoderequirephysicsjs  entry point requirephysicsjsbodiesrectangle   submodule codepre  pI have tried variations of this configp  precoderesolve      modulesDirectories [         jsbowercomponents     ],     alias          physicsjs PhysicsJSdist,          doesnt find physicsjs.js          physicsjs PhysicsJSdistphysicsjs.js          doesnt find the submodules      , codepre  pThe directory structure looks something like thisp  precode js    main.js    bowermodules      PhysicsJS        dist          physicsjs.js  module entry point          bodies            rectangle.js  desired submodule    lib      MyModule.js codepre  pNote that PhysicsJS does have a minified version of the entire library, which I will use if there is no other alternative, but I would rather only load what I actually use.p  pAlso, the submodules themselves use coderequirephysicsjscode, so calling coderequirephysicsjsphysicsjscode is emnot a solutionem.p

Positive 1281 pIm using Visual Studio 2013. I have a Custom Build Tool I think thats the right terminology at least created which processes Simulink .slx files. The gist of how it works is that VS will compile a Simulink model by launching MATLABSimulink and telling it to build the Simulink model into a DLL and generate some headers for use in other VS projects in the Solution. That functionality works just fine from the MATLABSimulink side. p  pThis Custom Build Tool, called Real Time Workshop  SLX, consists of a .props file, a .targets file, and a .xml file. To use it, I have a VS project with its Configuration Type set to Utility Properties, General page and my Custom Build Tool checked in the projects Build DependenciesBuild Customization... dialog. Then I drag various .slx files onto the project in the Solution Explorer and it adds them. Then I can build the project and it will process each .slx file as described above. p  pEach .slx file is dependent on a number of MATLAB scripts and other files. Changes in one of those other files needs to trigger a rebuild of the .slx file by Simulink. Currently, whenever the .slx file itself is unchanged, VS just skips over it. I cant seem to set additional dependencies for the .slx files.p  pIf I go to the Properties dialog for an individual .slx file, the Item Type specifies my Real Time Workshop  SLX as expected. However, when I go to the General page underneath Real Time Workshop  SLX things are grayed out and there is no Additional Dependencies entry.p  pI thought the purpose of Custom Build Tools was specifically to enable special processing like this. How do I specify file dependencies for the individual .slx files to be processed by my Real Time Workshop  SLX Custom Build Toolp  pOne other thing to note is that it appears that additional dependencies can be added to the .props file within the codeltAdditionalDependenciesgtcode tag, but then that creates a dependency relationship for emallem .slx files, which is not a viable solution.p

Positive 1281 pHopefully I explain this well enough so that it isnt confusing.p  pLets say Im creating a static library called SimpleImage. It uses two external static libraries GraphicsMagick and libsquish. In my Additional Dependencies I include codelibsquish.libcode and codeCORERLMagick.libcode, as well as the dependencies for these libraries for example, GraphicsMagick requires codeCORERLpng.libcode and codeCORERLbzlib.libcode.p  pNow, lets say I have another static library called SimpleGraphics. One of its dependencies is my static library SimpleImage. Now, my question is, do I STILL need to include codelibsquish.libcode, codeCORERLMagick.libcode, codeCORERLpng.libcode, etc. Or would that be redundantp  pThe reason Im asking is because Ive noticed that my static libraries are huge when compiled, and Im curious if this is the culprit. When I eventually include my master static lib in either a DLL or an executable, they are also bloated in size. There is another program out there that uses the exact same libraries I do, plus MANY more BOOST, an XML library, etc, and the exe is way smaller 3,141 MB than my executable 5,503 MB. My actual code base is much smaller than this other program to begin with. And yes, I have all optimizations on.p  pI just want to know if adding all these additional dependencies are necessary.p
Positive 1281 pI have been messing around with py2exe and I was able to self contain everything into a single executable. However, after all of the required libraries are imported, and the executable is made. The program ends up being around 20 MB My program only represents about 2MB of that. p  pAlthough this isnt terrible, Id like it smaller if possible. If I were to do regular updates, I wouldnt want a dozen people to keep having to download 20 MB of data for every little change, especially if a lot of that data is just python dependencies that wont change.p  pIs there any way with py2exe to have it so all of emmy programem files are in the EXE and then the library.zip file just includes all of the dependencies Or maybe two zip files, one for my program, and one for the python dependenciesp  pFor examplep  precode  setupwindows[fileInfo],    optionspy2exe                         bundlefiles 2,                        optimize 2,                      ,   ,   zipfilelibrary.zip,     codepre  pThanks for any help.p

Positive 1281 pWhat is the best way to tackle the following use case with a package only application structure in meteorp  pPeople should be able to use a search box that searches different types of media like pictures or articles. The search package itself should be extendable because more media types can be added later on.p  pFirst I created a package appsearch, apparticle and apppicture. Is this really the best way to go Furthermore I am not sure how to handle the dependencies between the packages in general. Does appsearch depend on apparticle or is it the other way aroundp  pBest case would be to be able to develop each package by its own in a clean enviroment. But if I try to implement the packages they become dependent soon. What is the best way to go in general to handle this problemp

Positive 1281 pI use the application component segmentation logic when creating my angular application, which is to say I have the following folder structurep  precodeapp.module.js app.config.js components  core  core.module.js  etc...  component1  component1.module.js  etc...  component2  component2.module.js  etc...  etc... shared  sharedComponent1  etc...  etc... assets codepre  pNow, I group all my components into my codeapp.module.jscode file and thats pretty much all that file is there for. My codecomponent1.module.jscode will list dependencies that module requires and so on. Now, I realize that it sort of doesnt matter where I define module dependencies and that I can put all my dependant module, regardless of component in the codeapp.module.jscode file, but thats simply not clean nor does it offer good modularity.p  pThat being said, Im not sure what to do with modules that are used in every, or almost every other module, like modules for localization for example. The real problem here isnt that the whole app uses that module, its that that universal module needs to be configured, so I was thinking about putting that dependency, and the required configuration, in the codecore.module.jscode and codecore.config.jscode file, respectively.p  pIve read a lot about angular best practices, but I wasnt able to find something concerning module dependency organization which, I suppose, is because angular puts all the modules in a big box anyway.p  pAnother approach would be to create a shared component that focuses on incorporating that particular dependency, or group of dependencies into angular, and then have my other components depend on that component, but Im not sure if this is too much.p

Positive 1281 pOur code base is split between several projects that have some dependency relationships between them. Say that executable codeEcode depends on static library codeLcode to be build. Therefore, within project codeEcode, some information is written stating it depends on codeLcode.p  pThe issue comes when handling the versions of these projects. codeEcode has codetrunkcode, codebranchcode the latest, ignore older ones, and codetagscode. Same for codeLcode that also has codetrunkcode, codebranchcode, and codetagscode.p  ul licodeEtrunkcode depends on codeLtrunkcode.li licodeEbranchcode depends on codeLbranchcode.li licodeEtags1.1code depends on codeLtags2.1code.li ul  pThe issue pops up when tagging. Indeed, we create the tag by copying the branch content. However, within codeEbranchcode the dependency is on codeLbranchcode. Therefore we usually first create codeEtagcode, and then change the dependencies within this tag. This is not good thing to change stuff in a tag. Furthermore its error prone as one can easily forget to change these dependencies it already happen, leaving us with a tag of a project depending on branches of other projects. Not exactly the purpose of a tag.p  pWeve tried to create another branch directory codereleasecode. This directory is a stagging area, where all dependencies are on sub project tags. Its this codereleasecode that is copied to codetagscode. This has proven possible where a project is mainly a dependencies project think of an overall project gathering everything for a final setup with very few code. But for other projects, this would mean managing all of codetrunkcode, codebranchescode, and codereleasescode. Impracticable.p  pDoes anyone know strategies for handling dependencies and taggingp

Positive 1281 pI have run into the following situation a couple of times and I cannot find a fully satisfying solutionp  pI am developing a Java application using OSGi and, following OSGis best practices, it is highly modularized. Heres an extract of some of my plugins and classes in themp  precode com.example.core.db.manager plugin      com.example.core.db.manager package           DatabaseManager interface   com.example.core.business.objectmanager plugin      com.example.core.business.objectmanager package           BusinessObjectManager interface   com.example.some.businessobjectmanager.consumer plugin      com.example.some.businessobjectmanager.consumer package           SomeBusinessObjectManagerConsumer interface             obviously this is not the real name, but the name is irrelevant codepre  pWherep  ul licodeDatabaseManagercode is a lowlevel construct that interacts directly with the database.li licodeBusinessObjectManagercode is a highlevel construct that acts among other things as a sort of adapter for the codeDatabaseManagercode.li licodeSomeBusinessObjectManagerConsumercode consumes codeBusinessObjectManagercode and should not know about the underlying database, not even that there emisem a database. It should emnotem know about the codeDatabaseManagercode rather, it should interact only with the codeBusinessObjectManagercode.li ul  pSo far so good. But now codeSomeBusinessObjectManagerConsumercode needs to update some edges between entities in the database I use a a hrefhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiGraphdatabase relnofollowgraph databasea, meaning my entities what would normally be rows in a table are nodes, and the relationships between them are edges. As explained before codeSomeBusinessObjectManagerConsumercode doesnt know anything about the database, but it knows there are some business objects nodes and that there are links between some of them edges.p  pIn codeBusinessObjectManagercode, I create a method codereplaceLinkscode as follows...p  pre classlangjava prettyprintoverridecodeUpdatedLinks replaceLinksBusinessObjectUID from, SetltBusinessObjectUIDgt to codepre  p...which is supposed to make sure that, by the time it returns, the codefromcode business object will only be linked to the codetocode objects, possibly removing previous links and adding new ones. I would like to know about these removals and additions. I create an interface codeUpdatedLinkscode in plugin codecom.example.core.business.objectmanagercodep  pre classlangjava prettyprintoverridecodepublic interface UpdatedLinks      SetltBusinessObjectUIDgt getRemovedLinks     SetltBusinessObjectUIDgt getAddedLinks  codepre  pBut the codeBusinessObjectManagercode is not really the one who is going to perform this link replacement and put together the codeUpdatedLinkscode return object. Instead, it delegates this to codeDatabaseManagercode. So I create an equivalent method in codeDatabaseManagercode, and codeBusinessObjectManagercode will simply invoke this method.p  pThe problem now is where to place the interface codeUpdatedLinkscode it is needed by codeDatabaseManagercode, codeBusinessObjectManagercode and codeSomeBusinessObjectManagerConsumercode, but the dependencies between these classes and their corresponding plugins goes in this directionp  precodeSomeBusinessObjectManagerConsumer dependsongt BusinessObjectManager dependsongt DatabaseManager codepre  pSop  ul liI cannot put codeUpdatedLinkscode in codeBusinessObjectManagercodes plugin because then it is not visible for codeDatabaseManagercode.li liI cannot put it in codeDatabaseManagercodes plugin because then it is not visible for codeSomeBusinessObjectManagerConsumercode remember that codeSomeBusinessObjectManagerConsumercode doesnt know anything about codeDatabaseManagercode because of modularization in OSGi, it can only have access to codeDatabaseManagercode if I declare an explicit dependency on it, which I dont want to do.li liIt is too specific to put it in some kind of utilities plugin.li liI do not currently have any plugin where it makes sense to put this interface and that would make it available to all the dependent plugins.li ul  pBasically, I would have to create a new plugin emjust for this interfaceem and I cannot even find any meaningful name for that plugin, considering who is going to depend on it. But mainly, I resist the idea of creating a plugin just for this interface, which exists just as a means to deliver the results of the codereplaceLinkscode method.p  pI have encountered this situation several times especially lately using OSGi, because of the modularization and I can never find a fully satisfying solution.

The others are measurements of complexity and readability, which really has nothing to do with quality.p blockquote  pApart from the fact that I dont agree with this statement at all, it got me thinking.p  pWhen I have to review code that has hardly any associated tests, whether unit, system or integration, I tend to approach the code much, much more warily than if I see a good suite of tests that have been successfully passed.p  pSame thing when performing security audits on code. If I see unused variables, huge functions, bizarre mixtures of configs, per server, per dir, etc. being used in Apache modules it also predisposes me to approach the code very warily.p  pDoes anyone else use this initial gut feeling approach and does it affect the outcomep  pBTW I dont agree with Kriss comment because all the other metrics are definitely valid measures that will help highlight badly designed, poorly executed code.

Negative 1281 pI come across this problem when i am writing an event handler in SharePoint. My event handler has a web reference. When i create this web reference, the URL of the web service will be added in the .config file of the assembly. If i have to change the web reference URL i just have to change the link in the config file. p  pProblem comes when I try to GAC the dll. When i GAC the DLL, the config file cannot be GACed along with the dll, and hence, there is no way for me to update the web reference. p  pOne workaround i have found is to modify the constructor method Reference.cs class which is autogenerated by visual studio when i add a reference, so that the constructor reads the web service url from some other location, say a registry or an XML file in some predetermined location. But this poses a problem sometimes, as when i update the web referenc using visual studio, this Reference.cs file gets regenerated, and all my modifications would be lost.p  pIs there a better way to solve this problemp

Negative 1281 pDeveloping server side code i finally got my eyes Xcrossed trying to write  and then understand, of course  forms or other html code in which text strings attributes within double quotes must occur in tagged string markup opening and closing properly but often javascript text within apostophes must be instantiated, quite often quoting other text within quotes, of course or instantiating computed values that must be placed within language dependent markup   pThis is a complete mess and a mainroad to blindness, and madness, and a sure way to waste my time tryng to figure out why the last cell in a  table is rendered before the table caption  sure, I missed an apostrophe in a string of 512 characters. After trying to reinvent the wheel crafting some API to manage the unmanageable, I have seen this possible solution well, the damned xhtml  is, in facts, XML. So why not use a XMl parser on server to create from scratch a document fragment, populate it adding childnodes at my will, then having the parser serialize all the fragment tree taking care of the stupid details like opening and closing tag, adding the apostrophes and all the other similar stuff Using it only in the backoffice side should keep low workload on the server  only few people in this planet could authenticate and access the serious stuff, so object creation and release is kept acceptable.p  pMy question is is this in your opinion a good solution to the problem mentioned above Maybe there are simpler solutions I am neglecting There is some problem I did not see Is it a sort of overkill Ironic congrats, you finally got it are accepted.p  pThanksp

Ive set up a SourceForge account, a git repository, as well as a document which lists all the features and what the program is going to accomplish.p  pA basic break down is that the suite is going to be written in java, and the suite will have the ability to support many languages via their locale.  The courses for learning the languages will be written in jython.  Coursemakers will have the ability to use premade jython courses to teach their course, or make their own original ones.  Im hoping this will allow for the software to teach copious languages via many mother tongues.p  pIm also planning on having a repository of released courses which are ones which I or people who better comprehend the language think are topnotch courses.  This will hopefully make the program seem more professional and secure to the users while allowing third party participation.p  pWith this in mindp  pAre there any fatal flaws or suggestions about my project you would like to makep  pIs there anything Im missing about making a big project in generalp  pThank you for your time and effort,p  pJoseph Pondp

Negative 1281 pI am working on an application that will have support for plugins. I am wondering if I can apply the LGPL on the application, or is the LGPL only for librariesp  pThe main point is that I want the application to be roughly GPL, but that this is not enforced on plugins or scripts that the application loads. However, the GPL considers plugins to be derived works, so a pure GPL is not good in this case.p  pCurrently I have been thinking about the MPL, but that explicitly states that the license will be under Californian jurisdiction, which for a European is not really acceptable.p  pWhat would the more prudent choice be for the license of the application be if I want a weak copy left. Are there any standard exceptions to the GPL that I should apply instead of the LGPL, and how does the LGPL apply to applications The license does speak about libraries, which for me is rather confusing if I want to apply it on an application.p

Negative 1281 pSo I use Qt a lot with my development and love it. The usual design pattern with Qt objects is to allocate them using codenewcode.p  pPretty much all of the examples especially code generated by the Qt designer do absolutely no checking for the codestdbadalloccode exception. Since the objects allocated usually widgets and such are small this is hardly ever a problem. After all, if you fail to allocate something like 20 bytes, odds are theres not much you can do to remedy the problem.p  pCurrently, Ive adopted a policy of wrapping large anything above a page or two in size allocations in a trycatch. If that fails, I display a message to the user, pretty much anything smaller, Ill just let the app crash with a codestdbadalloccode exception.p  pSo, I wonder what the schools of thought on this are on thisp  pIs it good policy to check each and every codenewcode operation Or only ones I expect to have the potential to failp  pAlso, it is clearly a whole different story when dealing with an embedded environment where resources can be much more constrained.

Negative 1281 pWe have an interesting problemp  pWe have a JMS queue of job statuses, and two identical processes pulling from the queue to persist the statuses via JDBC. When a job status is pulled from the queue, the database is checked to see if there is already a row for the job. If so, the existing row is updated with new status. If not, a row is created for this initial status.p  pWhat we are seeing is that a small percentage of new jobs are being added to the database twice. We are pretty sure this is because the jobs initial status is quickly followed by a status update  one process gets one, another process the other. Both processes check to see if the job is new, and since it has not been recorded yet, both create a record for it.p  pSo, my question is, how would you go about preventing this in a vendorneutral way Can it be done without locking the entire tablep  pEDIT For those saying the architecture is unsound  I agree, but am not at liberty to change it.p

BUT webkit seems to have its own problems with this now, since it wants to center the text vertically ignoring any evidence of lineheight according to the height of everything.  In other words, if you want the text vertically closer to the top, I havent been able to figure out a way to do that.p  pIdeasp

My main problem with this code is the codeinvokeLatercode stuff.p  pAs far as I understand codeinvokeLatercode, it sends a task to the event dispatching thread EDT and then the EDT executes this task whenever it can whatever that means. strongIs that rightstrongp  pTo my understanding, the code works like thisp  ol lipIn the codemaincode method we use codeinvokeLatercode to show the window codeshowGUIcode method. In other words, the code displaying the window will be executed in the EDT.pli lipIn the codemaincode method we also start the codecountercode and the counter by construction is executed in another thread so it is not in the event dispatching thread. Rightpli lipThe codecountercode is executed in a separate thread and periodically it calls codeupdateGUIcode. codeupdateGUIcode is supposed to update the GUI. And the GUI is working in the EDT. So, codeupdateGUIcode should also be executed in the EDT. It is the reason why the code for the codeupdateGUIcode is enclosed in codeinvokeLatercode. Is that rightpli ol  pWhat is not clear to me is why we call the codecountercode from the EDT. Anyway, it is not executed in the EDT.

Negative 1281 pI am having trouble getting my model manager to behave correctly when using the Admin interface. Basically, I have two modelsp  precodeclass Employeemodels.Model     objects  models.EmployeeManager     username  models.CharFieldmaxlength45, primarykeyTrue     . . .  class Eotmmodels.Model Employee of the Month     date  models.DateField     employee  models.ForeignKeyEmployee     . . . codepre  pAnd I have an codeEmployeeManagercode class that overrides the codegetcode method, something like thisp  precodeclass EmployeeManagermodels.Manager     useforrelatedfields  True      def getself, arguments, keywords         try             return superEmployeeManager, self.getarguments, keywords         except self.model.DoesNotExist             If there is no Employee matching query, try an LDAP lookup and create             a model instance for the result, if there is one. codepre  pBasically, the idea is to have codeEmployeecode objects automatically created from the information in Active Directory if they dont already exist in the database. This works well from my application code, but when I tried to create a Django admin page for the codeEotmcode model, things werent so nice. I replaced the default widget for codeForeignKeycode fields with a codeTextInputcode widget so users could type a username since codeusernamecode is the primary key. In theory, this should call codeEmployeeManager.getusernamewhatevercode, which would either return an codeEmployeecode just like the default manager or create one and return it if one didnt already exist. The problem is, my manager is not being used.p  pI cant find anything in the Django documentation about using custom codeManagercode classes and the Admin site, aside from the a hrefhttpdocs.djangoproject.comendevtopicsdbmanagerscontrollingautomaticmanagertypes relnofollowgeneric manager documentationa. I did find a a hrefhttpmitchfournier.comp11 relnofollowblog entrya that talked about specifying a custom manager for codeModelAdmincode classes, but that doesnt really help because I dont want to change the model represented by a codeModelAdmincode class, but one to which it is related.p

Negative 1281 pWhat are the proscons of having a centralized continuous integrationbuild setup in our case it will be cruise control as opposed to projectspecific setup p  pSo far, we had a project specific setup of cruisecontrol, but now many other groups want to move to CI as well, and are asking for a central cruiseserver. Id like to know if anyone has any experience goodbad to share that can help me on this.p  pHere are some initial thoughts p  pPros A central system would be easy to administer avoiding duplication of efforts all across the organization in setting up and maintaining cruise instances for various projects.p  pCons The central system may have to be a more controlled setup w.r.t access etc., and hence may need to be owned by a dedicated persongroup, while the project cruise instances can be under the control of the project group, making changesenhancements faster and projectspecific. p  pId appreciate any inputs on this.p

Negative 1281 pI am creating a PHP application and Im having a bit of trouble finding a solution for a problem Im having. I need to somehow completely deny access to anyone trying to access files on a web server likely by returning a 403 Forbidden error or something via HTTP unless a certain condition is true, such condition would be checked on a perconnection basis. I need to find the best way to do this, Im guessing I need to set some special settings in Apache that I can modify with PHP, but these Apache settings much obviously be configurable via PHP. As you can guess, I can write PHP well but have little experience with advanced Apache configurations.p  pI was thinking on that maybe if I used chmod via PHP to change the files permissions for a validated user and have them change back when the connection is closed it would work, but if there are concurrent connections then the users connecting afterwords would have full access regardless of whether or not they are valid, the could actually just bypass the validation. Maybe there is a better way to do it like this however.p  pThanks very much for the helpp

Negative 1281 pI got stumped within my code. I think classes will be simpler than structures, but the chapter within my book makes me do structures.   I am currently getting an error message that my function was not matched up for an overloaded function. The book does talk about them, but the examples of overloading functions in the book arent helping me out. Also the book wants me to enter account numbers and fill in the objects and when they are asked for an account number they should have the opportunity to QUIT entering numbers and proceed onto the next part of the program that whole way of thinking has my brain a bit fried and I was hoping I could get some help. I apologize if the formatting of my code is messy, I tried to reformat it within here so it would all go into the code brackets.p  pThe Error happens at line... 161 at the displayAccounts function. Parameters were different within the top and bottom of the two functions I changed it and it works. I am going to go over different parts and if its correct post the correct code.p  pI figured out exactly the question that I need. I need the QUIT loop to be allowed to be followed up within the account numbers.

Once theyve made all their desired changes on the page, they hit Save, and Hibernate does its magic to run the required SQL on the database. Apparently, Hibernate works out which records need to be deleted, which need to be inserted, and leaves the rest untouched. Unfortunately, it does the INSERTs first, then it does the DELETEs.p  pIf the user deletes a link to a payment, then changes their mind and reinserts a link to the same payment, Hibernate quite happily tries to insert it then delete it. Since these insertsdeletes are running as separate SQL statements, Oracle validates the constraint immediately on the first insert and issues strongORA00001 unique constraint violatedstrong.p  pWe know of only two optionsp  ol liMake the constraint deferrableli liRemove the unique constraintli ol  pOption 2 is not very palatable, because the constraint provides excellent protection from nasty application bugs that might allow inconsistent data to be saved. We went with option 1.p  precodeALTER TABLE bondpayments ADD   CONSTRAINT bondpaymentuk UNIQUE bondnumber, paymentid   DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED codepre  pThe downside is that the index created to police this constraint is now a nonunique index, so may be somewhat less efficient for queries. We have decided this is not as great a detriment for this particular case. Another downside advised by Gary is that it may suffer from a particular Oracle bug  although I believe we will be immune at least, mostly due to the way the application works.p  pAre there any other options we should considerp

Then, it will print the list, swap the last two, print the list again, and return up one level and repeat.p  pFor example, for 123p  blockquote   p123 swap position 0 with position 0p  precode    23    gt 123 swap position 1 with position 1     32    gt 132 swap position 1 with position 2 codepre      p213 swap position 0 with position 1p  precode    13    gt 213 swap position 1 with position 1     31    gt 231 swap position 1 with position 2 codepre      p321 swap position 0 with position 2p  precode    21    gt 321 swap position 1 with position 1     12    gt 312 swap position 1 with position 2 codepre blockquote  pfor a four letter number 1234p  blockquote   p1234 swap position 0 with position 0p  precode    234    swap position 1 with position 1             34 gt 1234            43 gt 1243     324    swap position 1 with position 2            24 gt 1324            42 gt 1342     432    swap position 1 with position 3            32 gt 1432            23 gt 1423 codepre      p2134 swap position 0 for position 1           134    swap position 1 with position 1                  34  2134                  43  2143           314    swap position 1 with position 2                  14 2314                  41 2341           431    swap position 1 with position 3                  31 2431                  13 2413p blockquote  pThis is the code i currently have for the recursion, but its causing me a lot of grief, recursion not being my strong suit.

When Im debugging a program I can see variables in the immediate scope, but I cant see variables which are global, static, or variables inherited by this class.

Negative 1281 pIm attempting to write tests for a very long and kludgy getPost method in a webapp Im working on for my job. Im using codeJUnitcode, codeHtmlUnitcode, and Jettys codeServletTestercode to approximate sending a request to a servlet and receiving a response. Ive managed to get it mostly working, but Im having a problem. Im trying to test the login functionality. If the user logs in successfully, the server should send some JSON back to the client with the users information. If the user is already logged in, the server should send back result failure and an error message.p  pMy problem comes when I try to test the second requirement. I can log in successfully, and get the correct data back. However, when I try to send the request again, it returns 404 not found. I tried breaking the code up into different tests, but I have to be able to call login twice in order to test the second requirement. Later tests in the JUnit file run just fine, and the servlet is staying connected the same time. I tried making a second, identical request, but that also failed. Ive searched the internet to no avail. In short, Im stumped.p  pHeres what Im working with unnecessary code has been edited outp  precodeIn MyFunServlet class private final static String USERIDATTRIBUTENAME  userid void doPostHttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response      String action  request.getParameteropt     final HttpSession session  request.getSession      ifaction  null        Long userId  Longsession.getAttributeUSERIDATTRIBUTENAME        ifuserId  null            do stuffz         else             ifaction.equalslogin                 User user  LoginUserrequest, response                try                    JSONObject json  new JSONObject                    ifrequest.getAttributeresult  success                        json.putresult, success                        json.putid, user.getId                        json.putname, user.getName                     else                         json.putresult, failure                        json.putmessage, request.getAttributemessage                                        SendJSONResponsejson, request, response                catchException e                              else                  System.out.printUnknown opt   action                 response.setStatusHttpServletResponse.SCNOTFOUND                              private void LoginUserHttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response     final HttpSession session  request.getSession     User user  null     Long userId  Longsession.getAttributeUSERIDATTRIBUTENAME     ifuserId  null         request.setAttributeresult, failure         request.setAttributemessage, The user is already logged in.      else          final String email  request.getParameteraccountEmail         final String password  request.getParameteraccountPassword         ifemail  null              user  helperClass.magicallyGetUserByEmailemail             ifuser  null                 ifuser.getPassword.equalspassword                     session.setAttributeUSERIDATTRIBUTENAME, user.getId                     request.setAttributeresult, success                                        else             request.setAttributeresult, failure                   return user   private void SendJSONResponseJSONObject json, HttpServletRequest request,                                 HttpServletResponse response      String contentStr  json.toString     response.setContentTypeapplicationjson     response.setStatus HttpServletResponse.SCOK     response.setContentLengthcontentStr.length     response.getWriter.printcontentStr     response.flushBuffer  codepre  pFor reference purposes, this file is 1084 lines long.

Negative 1281 pIm pretty new to the world of SOA and I have read already a lot about it. Theres one thing however that is still not clear to me which is handling large data volumes. p  pSo far our company used feeds to integrate between different applications. For example, AS400 would spit out a large number of xml files which are picked up by another app that processes it and stores it inside their internal database. The drawback is that we have to handle this file feeds on both ends with all possible problems that comes along. Multiply this a number of times, different applications that require integration, different teams, lack on overall rules for this and you can imagine where we are today.p  pThe company decided to adopt a SOA strategy and therefore Im looking into this matter. I wonder if the SOA concept includes problems like this integration issues as mentioned above. But it is hard to find information on this topic. Is it because SOA and large volumes is just not doable, is it because I need to look to somewhere else to solve this issue Master data management perhaps, or do I need to start fighting all this large data volume feeds and ban them from our companyp  pthanks already for any insight in this matter p

Negative 1281 pIm asking this question for posterity reasons and general interest.  Years ago I noticed an odd behavior within Windows.  I know this works in XP and at that time it also worked in Windows 2000 and even 98 and Id assume this behavior still works for Windows 7.p  pTo setup my question, try this experiment by following these steps.p  ol liOpen the Task Manager and navigate to the Processes tab.li liOpen an application that you use that you know consumes a fair amount of memory a web browser should work fine and find the process in the Task Manager.li liNow use the application by opening windows, documents, web pages, etc. until the Memory Usage of your application grows significantly.li liMake note of the applications Memory Usage and minimize the application you should see a significant reduction in the amount of memory that the application is using.li liFinally, restore the application.li ol  pAfter restoring the Window, you should that that the Memory Usage of the application should spike a little but no where near as much as it was before you minimized the application.  This is quite consistent with any GUI based application but it is certainly more profound with larger applications.p  pstrongQUESTIONstrongp  pInternally within the OS, what process is taking place that forces this assumed garbage collection to take place  Furthermore, via COM or some .Net calls is there a way to force this process without minimizing an application  If so, please provide source code.  The language doesnt matter.p  pIf you are like me, you may keep a lot of applications open at the same time.  Memory usage can creep up... up... up.. and before you know it, you need to close a few applications to free resources.  It would be nice if I could at least integrate into the software that I have control a mechanism to force garbage collection from the OS similar to the behavior from the exercise above.  p  pI know that in .Net there is a GC object and you can call the garbage cleanup as you desire.  It does not, however, seem to be related with the nature of the memory cleanup that happens when an application is minimized.p  pI hope this is a head scratcher and that after years of curiosity that someone can give me a good, technical explanation of what is going on.p  pstrongPage Files and Going Further Down the Rabbit Holestrongp  pInteresting stuff has been posted as an answer to this question by Kragen amp Alex K.

Negative 1281 pIm developing a game in as3 for iPhone, and Ive gotten it running reasonably well consistanty 24fps on iPhone 3G, but Ive noticed that when the character goes partly off the screen, the frame rate drops to 1012fps.  Does anyone know why this is and what I can do to remedy itp  pUpdate  Been through the code pretty thoroughly, even made a new project just to test animations.  Started a image offscreen and moved it across the screen and back off.  Any time the image is offscreen, even partially, the frame rates are terrible.  Once the image is fully on the screen, things pick back up to a solid 24fps.  Im using cacheAsBitmap, Ive tried masking the stage, Ive tried placing the image in a movieclip and using scrollRect.  I would keep objects from going off the screen, except that the nature of the game Im working on has objects dropping from the top down yes, Im using object pooling.  No, Im not scaling anything.  Striclt x,y translations.  And yes, I realize that ObjC is probably the best answer, but Id really like to avoid that if I can.  AS3 is so much nicer to write inp

As the upload is processed, it uploads the UploadProcessing record with the current status of the work until it is finally completed.p  pI first started with just calling the codeWCFClient.ProcessUploadargs...code from the codeCommitClickcode event, but that just processed the upload and waited until it was complete before enabling the AJAX update status timer which always showed that it had already completed because it had. Then I tried calling the same method asynchronously but it appeared to function in the same way because the page wouldnt fully post back to the client with the enabled timer until the async complete handler got its response, effectively resulting in the same completed response to the user.p  pSo what Im politely and respectfully asking the community is how would you fire and forget this codeProcessUploadcode method via WCF so it can do its thing in the background while the page is free to async postback and monitor its status Perhaps some sort of ThreadPool solution on the WCF side Or maybe a slave service that monitors the UploadProcessing table for pending uploads and then handles them that wayp  pThank you in advance for any advicep

Negative 1281 pI have a text box for searching my photos website. As a user types, instead of showing a list of suggestions, I would like to show a count of results, informing my user that there are photos for what they are typing.p  pI will add an onChange event to my text box, that will call my AJAX function. The function will then gather what has been typed already, AJAX it to my ASP page that produces the count and posts it back to display.p  pI know how to accomplish this but I dont know how it will work on performance. The problem I foresee is if the user types a really long string, really quickly, it might have to do 50 calls for each character in string.

Negative 1281 pI am trying to use Telerik MVC Q2 TabStrip which contains a Telerik MVC Grid within it. The Grid is returned in a Partial View by TabStrips LoadContentFrom. The Grid is based on ajax binding mode and works well in IE and Google Chrome. But when I use Mozilla Firefox, the Grid shows no records. Infact when I debugged the same, I found that the Controller Action method which fetches the records as specified in databinding Ajax.Select of the Grid is never called. So this surely seems to be some JavaScript problem. p  pLooking for a solution on web, I came across various resources which basically hinted at including the Grids JavaScript files manually in cases where the Grid is loaded inside a Partial View. Even though this is not required starting from the Telerik version 2011 Q2, nevertheless I tried registering the JavaScript files manually but could not get the grid working on Mozilla. Now I am really clueless as to what prevents the Telerik from fetching the data using Ajax Binding. The TabStrip code is given below. p  precodeHtml.Telerik.TabStrip.NameTabStrip     .Itemsitems gt                  items.Add.TextDonor List                    .LoadContentFromDonorList, DonorSearch.Selectedtrue          codepre  pThe DonorList action method above returns a Partial View that contains the Telerik Grid in question.

Negative 1281 pI am making a application in WPF. I am using a lot the a hrefhttp3dtools.codeplex.com relnofollow3DToolsa. I have a tetrahedron and, inside it, a cube.

So, if I want to move it deeper in the screen, I just rotate the tetrahedron and move it in Y axis, for example. I think this can be a good solution.p  pI have to problems, and I would like help to solve then first, when I move my tetrahedron inside the Trackball the Trackball looks like moving all the system coordinates. I say this because I draw axis for debug purpose, and those axis are being rotate also. But this is not true  they are moving just because are objects inside the trackball right. strongEDITstrong Actually, I think the coordinate system inside the trackball are really changing. When I move the cube in YX axis, I behaves ok. But if I turn a little bit, and try to move in the Z axis, I see it getting bigger closer to camera and smaller far from camera. p  pSo my questions is stronghow to define a plane which will not be rotate by trackballstrong For me the answer looks something like ok, just define it outside the track ball but, as I said and 3DTools documentation say I have a border over my viewport...

Negative 1281 pGiven a run length encoded string, say A3B1C2D1E1, decode the string inplace. The answer for the encoded string is AAABCCDE. Assume that the encoded array is large enough to accommodate the decoded string, i.e. you may assume that the array size  MAX[lengthencodedstirng,lengthdecodedstring]. p  pThis does not seem trivial, since merely decoding A3 as AAA will lead to overwriting B of the original string.p  pAlso, one cannot assume that the decoded string is always larger than the encoded string. Eg Encoded string  A1B1, Decoded string is AB. Any thoughtsp  pAnd it will always be a letterdigit pair, i.e. you will not be asked to converted code0515code to code0000055555codep

Negative 1281 pSorry for the vague title.p  pCurrently, if a value is typed into a QDoubleSpinBox which is out of its range e.g. typing 100 when max is 90, the value is rejected and instead the last valid value is placed back into the SpinBox.p  pI want to change this behavior to allow typing outofrange values which will be automatically corrected to either the minimum or maximum, because otherwise it would be stupidly hard for the user to guess the value range. After studying the docs and source code of QT, I decided to subclass QSpinBox will deal with Double variant later into QSpinBoxFS, and reimplement both methods mentioned in the title. Somehow though, this is having no effect at all, the behavior is still the same.p  pThese are my methodsp  precodeQValidatorState QSpinBoxFSvalidateQString ampinput,                                        int amppos      QIntValidator validator  new QIntValidator     return validatorgtvalidateinput, pos   int QSpinBoxFSvalueFromTextconst QString amptext      const int max  maximum     const int min  minimum      QString copy  text     int dummy  0      QValidatorState state  validatecopy, dummy      if state  QValidatorAcceptable              bool ok         int num  locale.toInttext, ampok, 10         if ok  goto badtext           if num lt min  return min          if num gt max  return max           return num          else              badtext         return max gt 0  min  max       codepre  pOf course, this is not really adequate to the pedantic checking done in QSpinBoxPrivatevalidateAndInterpret, but I just want the basic concept working for now. I tried changing validate to always return Acceptable, but weirdly enough the resulting spinboxes would still behave in the old way.p  pEither a correction of my own methods or a different approach to this problem are welcome Thank you for your time.p

This means when carrying out any meta tweaks they can be done in the template rather than someone going into my controllers.p  pHope someone can shed some light,p  pThanks for reading.p

Negative 1281 h3What This Question Is emNotem Abouth3  pThis question is emnotem about how to autoclose a file with Fileclose or the Fileopen block syntax. Its a question about where Ruby stores its list of open file descriptors at runtime.p  h3The Actual Questionh3  pIf you have a program with open descriptors, but you dont have access to the related File or IO object, how can you find a reference to the currentlyopen file descriptors Take this examplep  precodefilenametmpfoo x touch filename  File.openfilename filehandle  File.openfilename codepre  pThe first File instance is opened, but the reference to the object is not stored in a variable. The second instance is stored in emfilehandleem, where I can easily access it with inspect or close.p  pHowever, the discarded File object isnt gone its just not accessible in any obvious way. Until the object is finalized, Ruby must be keeping track of it somewhere...but wherep

Negative 1281 pSo Ive been developing an instant messenger for iOS, which uses APNS for notifications when a user has no active sessions.p  pCurrently, if the user is active, it will not send a notification, but there may be times when a message is sent, and then the user closes the app a split second after the message arrived.p  pThis means that the user will probably miss the message, since no notification was sent. On the other hand, if a notification is sent all the time, the user will probably get a ding dong on the lock screen.p  pMy question is, is sending an APNS notification along with every message industry standard Do apps like whatsappviber do this, or do they try to play nice with APNS and only use it when theres no sessions storedp
Negative 1281 pBefore anyone says duplicate I have looked at other questions with similar titles and none answer my specific question, so please read onp  pI am a complete web development novice but have started looking into very basic HTTP and HTML. My background is RPCSOAP style services and desktop apps. The thing is I am really quite confused about HTTP itself at a fundamental level, in particular the POST, PUT and DELETE verbs.p  pI can understand that GET is used to request a page from a web server, but I dont understand what happens when you actually do any of the other three verb actions. If you are a hosting a web page on Apache or IIS and you have a web form with a submit button, presumably that will send a POST with the data you have filled out in the form...but what does the web server do with this How does a web page even make use of PUT and DELETE PUT what DELETE what Its not like you are calling some method on a service that then does an action against a database. I presume frameworks like ASP.NET come into play here, but in vanilla HTTPHTML I just dont get how it fits together...p  pI am really totally missing something here...help appreciatedp

Now read the following quote from the articlep  blockquote   pThe potential exists that the environment the program is being run on does not support 3D texturing, which would cause us to get a NULL address back, and attempting to use a NULL pointer is A Bad Thing so make sure to check for it and respond appropriately the provided example exits with an error. p blockquote  pThat quote is referring to the following functionp  precodeglTexImage3D  PFNGLTEXIMAGE3DPROC wglGetProcAddressglTexImage3D codepre  pWhen running my program on my computer which has OpenGL 3.3 that same function returns null for me. When my friend runs it on his computer which has OpenGL 1.2 it does not return null. p

Negative 1281 pIm a data scientist with mediocre coding skills, so until now in working with neo4j, Ive avoided java in favor of Cypher and Gremlin. p  pIve shoved a bunch of graph data into neo4j with a weight property on each edge. Id like to run aStar or dijkstras on this graph from within the gremlin console if possible. JUNG seems not to have a weighted shortest path algorithm, so Ive turned to GraphAlgoFactory, but all the discussion of it online seems to be in straight Java.p  pMy goal is to get the shortest weighted path between two vertices of my choosing where the weights are dictated by the weight properties on the edges.p  pThanksp

I found a PHP directive setting that seems to mention subdirectories, but it looks like it is referring to subdirectories of temporarily stored session files. p  pIve double checked using the HTTPFox firefox plugin, as soon as I visit any page 2 levels deep, the session is gone, and and a new session ID is issued.

Negative 1281 pIn my android app, I am reading a file from internal storage every time a new game loads. The first 4 times I do this, it works fine, but on the fifth time it force closes.

If I change the length to 2000000, it closes after the second time and if I change it to 100000 it closes after the eighth time. Im pretty clueless as to why this would happen because I am creating a new byte array every time the method is called so I wouldnt think that the size would change anything.p  pUpdatep  pAfter going back and doing some more testing it seems like file input has nothing to do with why my app is force closing. When this code is commented out, the app will load five levels in a row without force closing so I thought that it was the problem, but it still force closes after eight tries so clearly theres something else thats not working. Thanks for your help anyway.p

Then I try to test it with Selenium.p  pIn Selenium, I find the element for the span containing the text of an item, and I call codeclickcode. No errors finding the element, and no errors calling codeclickcode, but the handler does not run. Looking around, it looks as if Ext sets up the handler for the entire tree and then sees what you clicked on to decide what you meant. So clicking on the span down there should be effective.p  pAny suggestionsp
Negative 1281 pI have set up a pseudo distributed mode cluster setup. The FIFO scheduler got stuck somehow in between and therefore a lot of jobs got piled up which I had scheduler through cron. Now, when I restarted YARN resourcemanager it gets stuck after a while and the jobs keep piling up. p  pIs there a way I can clear the whole queue. Or, is it that my complete understanding of hadoop scheduling is somewhere flawed. Please help. p
Negative 1281 pId like to have an widget with items organized in tree structure. However it should be viewed in one line and every substree should be represented in braces. For examplep  pstrong1. element1 2. element2 3. element3strong em3. element31 4. element41 4. element43 5. element53  5. element 51 6. element61em 3. element32 4. element 42 strong4 element4 5. element5strongp  pEach element should also have an associated icon and should be clickable. I think about QListView or QTreeView. The second one sounds better but I have to idea how to force it to display items in such manner.p

Negative 1281 pSuppose an URL is encoded in a multibyte character set where one of the characters in the multibyte sequence could be between 0 and 127, i.e. an otherwise valid 7bit ASCII character.p  pExample The Japanese codeShiftJIScode character set, where the character codecode would be escaped as code834acode. Now code4acode is also the ASCII character codeJcode, so I could instead write code83Jcode.p  pWould that be OK by the whatever standards applyp  pIm not asking because I want to send URLs like this although the latter saves a couple bytes, but whether I should accept those on the server side, i.e. whether it is standardscompliant and also, whether I can expect other servers to handle this in the same way.p

And after checking a certain valuelets say that im checking whether the object I get with given key has a null name, I add them to a list.

My need is to apply the rest of procedures after every id is checkedmapping in redis db and checking the name. But I do not know how to do it. Maybe if I can attach callback to the for loop and assure the rest of my functions start to run after loop is finishedi know its impossible but just to give an ideap

Negative 1281 pI am currently working on porting a vb.net winforms program over to a web based version, and one of the functions in the original program has be stumped.p  pIn the original program, every 5 minutes, a form pops up for user input. There is also a label control on the main form which counts down to the next popup. This is accomplished with a single timer control with a 1 second duration. every tick, it decrements the countdown, and when the countdown reaches 0, it pops up the form and then resets. Simple enough, but in my web app, I cant afford to be doing a postback every second, so what I am attempting is to combine a javascript countdown widget with an AJAX timer. Essentially, what should happen is that when the page loads, the countdown begins decrementing from 300  seconds, and the AJAX timer begins with a duration of 300 seconds. My idea is that when the timer ticks, it will run my function, as well as reset the countdown to 300 seconds again.p  pMy problem, is that I am not able to reset the countdown with the code that I have, and I know that I am doing something likely very simple wrong, but I dont know enough Java to know what.p  pIf I hardcode the Timer var to 300, the countdown works, and the timer ticks fires the additional functons, but the countdown just keeps counting down into negative numbers. How do I reset the countdown variable from  code behindp  pHere is the countdown functionp  precode    var Timer  lt CountDown gt      function updateClock            Update Countdown         Timer  1         var TimerMin  Math.floorTimer  60         var TimerSec  Timer  TimerMin  60         TimerSec  TimerSec lt 10  0    TimerSec         var TimerFormat  TimerMin    TimerSec           Update the countdown display         document.getElementByIdjavaCountdown.firstChild.nodeValue  TimerFormat        codepre  pHere is the body codep  precodeltbody onloadupdateClock setIntervalupdateClock, 1000 gt codepre  pAnd the Code Behindp  precodeProtected Sub PageLoadByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs Handles Me.Load     Countdown  300 End Sub  PProtected Sub Timer1TickByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As EventArgs Handles Timer1.Tick     Countdown  300     Additional Functions End Sub codepre

Negative 1281 pI found a few questions related to this, but none that I could figure out how to apply to my issue.

My problem is that event handler for the CheckChanged event is not firing.

Negative 1281 pIf I use the System.Windows.Forms.MessageBox class show function to draw a message box, a window pops up. I would like to know where the actual code to draw this window is Is it in some Win32 API or user32.dll etc. Through reflector I am unable to see the definition of Show method.p  pAlso, is .NET a wrapper around win32 api then I know that when we compile .net code it generates IL which is converted to CPU specific instructions at run time and then our CPU executes those instructions. But I have a feeling that there is some common code in Windows OS thats responsible for drawing a window or reading from text file etc.. All these languages like C, F, C, Java etc. eventually call that code from within the framework. But the question how can I go about finding it and verify itp  pFor example in MFC or Win32 whichever function we called to draw a window on the screen, MessageBox.Show also calls the same function but its abstracted from usp  pThen on the other hand we can inter operate between two languages.p  pSo I am little confused here. Also I am reading CLR via C these days so my brain is in super excited state p
Negative 1281 pIve recently signed up for an Azure account as I am developing a Django application and porting it from Heroku. Ive created a Windows Server 2012 vm on Azure and Ive managed to copy my application and install its dependencies on the VM. Ive also managed to run it directly on the command line. Now Id like to run it under IIS. Ive searched around the net and it seems there are many ways to skin this cat. Id like to know the best way. Which approach would a professional who is deploying a production site use Im having a hard time finding out what the best approach is. The docs on the Django site are reportedly outdated and it points to another site which explains how to install Django with performance tools. The documentation on MSDN only includes tutorials that show installing under Windows and running from the command line or installing to an Ubuntu VM. Im looking to get some guidance from someone who has done this and could explain the merits and weaknesses of one method over another. Thanks in advancep

Negative 1281 pIve got a quick question to the Oracle XML DB experts p  pI measured the insert performance of several large xml files. In theory XMLType CLOB should have a unrivaled insert performance, because the inserted XML document is directly written in a character large object, no conversion needed. But my measurements suggest that the insert in the XMLType BINARY column is much faster, although it is a preparsed binary format. Can someone tell me how this is possiblep

Negative 1281 pHi stackoverflow members, Do you know why an instance variable in a Java Class must be declared only in one line and not in 2 for examplep  precodeString ring ring  indeed  codepre  pIt gives a compilation error. Why is it not allowed It is senseless doing it as I did in this example, however it might be useful using that procedure to initialize the variable inherited from a superclass without using the subclass constructor.p  pfor examplep  precodeclass Ringo String ring  class RingoStar extends Ringo ring  Thats how to play drums  codepre  pObviously it gives a compilation error. Thats the point, Does anyone know why it is not allowedp

I also dont want to need to keep track of a list of default options somewhere Id like to just set their animation settings as they are initialized, so any scripts later dont need to worry about passing in options.p  pIs there a way to save the default options for select targets Something like...p  precodefoo.setDefaultOptionshide,  New Defaults   or... foo.hide.defaults   New Defaults  codepre  pSo calling the below will just use those options without further inputp  precodefoo.hide  Uses those default values set earlier codepre  pThank you.p

Negative 1281 pQuick question. p  pI have a select droplist that contains items from a DB.

However, it posts everytime I loop through the dropdown.p  pI know the reason for this is because my ajax code is contained in the .each loop that loops through each item int he select list. How can I code it, so that the post action happens only once p  precode grab current val var cv  this.val   loop through gov bodies drp to make sure that value isnt already present drpCurrentGOVBody option.eachfunction        if cv  this.text           value is already present         select it in drp down         this.attrselected, selected       else           value isnt present.

What type of transformation does NAudio do, and how can I get it ton give me the audio stream in such a way that I can serialize it and the browser will be able to play it Or for another suggestion if NAudio to heavyweight for something as simple as raising the volume whats a better option for me p

Negative 1281 pUsing Google Maps v3, Im trying to create a map with a marker that is always centered on the maps location. When the marker is draggable, the marker is never replicated on the mirrors of the same map by that I mean the identical maps you see when at zoom level 1.

Negative 1281 pI am writing a programm to show my notes like the short notes of windows 7 on the desktop. Therefore i created a main window with a menu from where you can create notes. If you click on newNote, a new note is created instantly and directly shown on the desktop, besides the main window.p  pOf course, later I only want to see the notes, and the handling of the notes should be made from an icon in the systray so no more with the mainwindow.

Negative 1281 pIm an embedded engineer not a network guru building a piece of Linuxbased equipment a portable measurement instrument that is normally not connected to the Internet, but we need to make it possible for the equipment to call home for support, including updates and troubleshooting, in a manner that compromises neither the products security, nor the customers network security nor our own company network.p  pThe call home capability will be completely controlled by the user, perhaps by pressing a physical button to activate it, after the equipment has been connected to whatever network the customer chooses to use.  For prototype and demonstrations systems, this network could be at someones home or office or even via a phone connection the equipment will contain only a wired Ethernet port, and the customer would need to provide a wired AP if WiFi access is desired.p  pMaking the connection should require no percall configuration at the users end, nor within our box, so Im thinking we can require the customer to provide DHCP, and not much else.  We can also require the customer to first contact us before pressing the call home button, so we can have our support interface up only when needed.p  pWhen a unit does call home, it merely makes a connection to a company system, doing nothing else until an engineer well, me directly connects to it.  Other than the existence of the connection, we should get no or minimal information about the network the customer is using.  So Im thinking some kind of SSH connection, but thats as far as I have gotten.p  pIf possible, it should feel as if Im connecting locally, as if the unit were on my desk perhaps with much more latency, loss, and minimal bandwidth.p  pBut I have no idea whatsoever how to make an SSH connection if thats the right tool to use for this as two separate halves The remote unit calls somewhere, presumably on one of our company systems, then that system notifies an engineer me that a call home has been initiated, then waits for the engineer to connect, forming the other half of the connection.p  pThe connection need not identify the remote system make, model, serial number, version, etc. Id do that manually after logging in securely.p  pIf needed, I can create a new system on our end Linux, BSD, Windows, whatever, physical or VM that can be dedicated to just this function.  I can get at least one static port mapped out to our corporate WAN, if needed but something Id prefer to avoid, if possible.p  pIdeally, Id also like for there to be minimal information in the equipment itself, so that possession of the equipment by an adversary or competitor could not compromise customer or company networks, other units, nor the callhome technique itself.  From what little I know, Id guess a hostname or IP address, a port number, and a key would be needed, but less would be betterp  pId also like the system to require manual intervention at both ends, with minimal automation that can be buggy or be compromised.  Once we implement and test the initial system, automation could be added as our experience with it, and confidence in it, grows.p  pThats about as far as my thinking has taken me.  Beyond this, Im pretty much clueless.  Am I on the right track  What pieces am I missing  Is this already a popular thing to do, and I simply dont know what it is called  How simple and stupid can this capability be made for a couple of prototype systemsp  pEDIT If it wasnt obvious already, please assume Im a networking idiot who can be trusted only to follow an explicit recipe, and not much more.  KISS appliesp

I have assigned a game thread, which handles most duties, and a render thread, which is tasked with swapping buffers and rendering.

Negative 1281 pIve been trying to work out the best practices on storing nonvolatile values.p  pA common solution is to store it in a database, for example if you are storing types of something, you then have a structure for normalization.p  pHowever, my problem is that this data will hardly ever change, and even if it does, the occasion will be so rare that it would prove more efficient to hard code it a class of constants for example.p  pThe second problem is that there is a risk if small that the data will be deleted, and finally, every installation would require this data be created first.p  pI am trying to build a system that does not depend on data to at least function not break, I do feel that data should be dependent on code to give it meaning, opposed to code being dependent on data to function.p  pHas anyone found an elegant methodology to thisp  pI have tagged as PHP, Symfony and Doctrine because these are the tools I am working with, the question is generally applicationframework agnostic, but if you can give examples based on those tools it would be helpful.p  pEditp  pAn example off the top of my head could be storing product types in a database.  I dont mean categories of products, much lower level.  Is the product material something you can touch, a service, information, or digital media.p  pOut of the physically possible variants that I can think of, only these four exist.  It feels meaningless to create a table for these types, but it also feels inelegant to hold a field in the products table stating which it is.p  pBased on which one it is, four very different branches of functions are possible, and these functions would be hard coded with some level of scalability obviously.p

This is done by my own buffer class, where I recently added a method to sorta minify the resulting HTML using emregexem that replaces em2 or more whitespacesem into emjust one spaceem.p  pThe result of this is the fact, that the final HTML has no new lines at all. That works fine in the browser and its displayed fine, no problem whatsoever.p  pIm not interested in any other method of HTML minifying or other PHP classes that do the same thing. I have a simple two liner that does everything I need and the resulting HTML is much smaller than before.p  pWhat I am interested in is this strongAre there any downsides of having an .html file with content that has emno new lines at allem and has all the source code in one very long linestrongp  pApart from the human readibility, of course  Im interested in somewhat technical or maybe even other reasons, that would render this a bad practice.p
Negative 1281 pI wanted to know how we can calculate the length of a text in a checkbox in pixels.

It works for chinese and japanese, but for other languages it is not returning the correct value.p  pIs there a better way to find out the text length in pixelsp  pThanks in advance.p

The output of this next statement is a 64 byte hex           string representing the 32 byte sha256 hash of the password.

As stated, I now only use vector.pushback for this, but thought Id post and see if there were any insights.p  precodeinclude ltstringgt include ltiostreamgt include ltfstreamgt include ltsstreamgt include ltnewgt  int main      ifstream infile.openfile.txt      string str1, str2 stringstream os      int length     string vecarr  new string[length]     length  0      whileinfile.eof              getlineinfile,str1         ifstr1.findexpression  stringnpos                      length             vecarr[length1]  str1                    infile.close     return 0  codepre

Negative 1281 pI am implementing a licensing system into my software using a MySQL database with the license key and unique machine ID combination of MAC code, CPU code and others. I was looking for a secure way to check the validity of a license key that the user enters into a text box in a C application.

Then I would access this file and get the return string from the C application by using a codeWebClientcode or codeWebRequestcode. p  pObviously, using this current method is insecure as you could redirect the URL to the localhost and fake the result. I guess my real question is, using this method, how can I make it more secure Is there a way for my C application to identify that it is connecting to the real PHP file by signing it or something  p

Maybe a little sprite I want to make something simple and get an insight on how this works. p  pI want to draw graphics in a new window 320x240, no antialiasing and get rid of the console window. Im a beginner, I dont really understand how this works, but from what I understand, C is just a programming language and Ill have to include something else which I dont know to draw the graphics. p  pIm using Notepad and MinGW for compiling my code. though compiling goes really slow. Id love to know a better and faster, but free compiler that just like MinGW, works across more than one platformp  pI hope someone could help me out. p  pThanks,p  pA very enthusiastic newbie and modellerartistmusician with big ideas. p

Negative 1281 pIm in the process of building a small system here at work that will track our patients data as we are conducting research for a new drug. p  pWith that said, Im at a loss on how I should structure the data for one aspect of this. We have several forms that must be completed for each patient. Not each patient will have all forms completed for them at the same time. No two forms have the same questions, same answers, or same number of questions. I have come up with the structure for the patient information and other general info, but I do not know how to structure this section with the forms.p  pThe way the users want the pages to work is that they would have a main page where they click on the study, then the patient name, and then there would be a list of all the completed forms for that patient as well as a button to complete a new form.p  pWould it be best to create a new table for each form and then do some huge union query to show the list of completed forms That doesnt seem like an efficient way to do this Ideasp

Negative 1281 pI am trying to lookup a value when two columns are the same. To start, I have a drop down menu. The users selects which item name they want and when they click it, it enters into cell H26. Next, I have a table. There are 4 columns  NAME, LOGIC, TITLE to DISPLAY, VLOOKUP.  p  pCells E39E43is the NAME column.  So pretty much when the user select from the drop down menu an item list those being Modules 17, Modules 812, etc., the label gets inserted into cell H26. The Logic column has an IF statement that will either put 17, 812, etc. or leave it blank. p  pI am using the Title to Display column to reference. Below is the table. I am trying to use the vlookup column and in one cell be able to lookup and match when a cell in the Logic column matches the cell in the Title to display. When a match occurs, I need the value, whether its 17, 812, 1316 etc. Can this be accomplished using one cell and with the least complicated logic. The front end program doesnt respond well to perplexed and elongated excel functions. Thank you for your time img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comSCned.png altenter image description herep
Negative 1281 pDoes anyone know how fast the copy speed is from Amazon S3 to Redshiftp  pI only want to use RedShift for about an hour a day, to run updates on Tabelau reports. The queries being run are always on the same database, but I need to run them each night to take in to account new data thats come in that day.p  pI dont want to keep a cluster going 24x7 just to be used for one hour a day, but the only way that I can see of doing this is to Import the entire database each night into Redshift I dont think you cant suspend or pause a cluster. I have no idea what the copy speed is so I have no idea if its going to be relatively quick to copy a 10GB file in to Redshift every night.p  pAssuming its feasible, my thinking is to push the incremental changes on SQL Server dbase in to S3. Using Cloud Formation, I automate the provisioning of a Redshift cluster at 1am for 1 hour, import the dbase from S3, and schedule Tableau to run its queries between that time and get its results. I keep an eye on how long the queries take, and If I need longer than an hour I just amend the cloud formation.p  pIn this way I hope to keep a really lean Tableau server by outsourcing all the ETL to Redshift, and buying only what I consume on Redshift.p  pPlease feel free to critique my solution, or out right blow it out of the water. Otherwise If the consensus of the answer is that importing is relevantly quick, It gives me a thumbs up Im headed in the right direction with this solution.p  pThanks for any assistancep

Negative 1281 pI build C DLL using MinGW and I want to use this DLL in visual studio application. But I get Linking Error. According to a hrefhttpwww.mingw.orgwikiInteroperabilityofLibrariesCreatedbyDifferentCompilerBrands relnofollowhttpwww.mingw.orgwikiInteroperabilityofLibrariesCreatedbyDifferentCompilerBrandsa this URL   DLLs that are written in C work too, as long as you communicate with them only through a C interface declared with extern C. If you do otherwise, you will probably get linker errors because different compilers mangle C names differently. p  pSo the problem seems to be with different name mangling used by different compilers. Is there a way by which MinGW could use same name mangling that is used by visual studiop
Negative 1281 pI want to achieve a menu bar whose background extends to the length of the browser window, while the actual menu is centered in the middle.

What is interesting is that, if I change the position of the container to fixed, it works just fine, but unfortunately that is not what I need. I need this menu to scroll with the pages content.p  pAny idea what I did wrong p  pstrongUPDATE 1.strongp  pI think I am zeroing in on the problem. After trying all your suggestions, including getting rid of the inner div, as well as playing with the width, I realized what the problem might be p  pThe container automatically inherits the width of the browser window, which on iPad is around 1000 pixels. But I have elements on the webpage that are wider than that, stretching the content area above a 1000 pixels. So, while the content of the webpage is stretching just fine, the 100 width element remains the width of the original browser window at about 1000 pixels and do not updates automatically like it does on desktop browsers. what baffles me, however, is why isnt fixed positioning affected by this I am trying to use minwidth at the moment to fix this problem.p
Negative 1281 pI have the following scenario, and couldnt find anything with Google searches so this is my last resort.p  pWhat my intention isp  pI want to create a single ASP.NET Web API project that implements ASP.NET Identity. So I have created numerous versions of these kinds of implementations the past few months, so the basics I understand, but what I want to do now is have a single point of login and user validation that multiple projects can use in the future.p  pSo I have implemented the basic project that exposes the bearer token on the end point Token with the whole granttypepassword but now I am stuck.p  pIf I now create another project and I want to secure that project without implementing it all again, and not allowing access to the users database to that project, how would I go about it.p  pSo Project 1 is the asp.net identity implementation.p  pProject 2 needs to secure its controllers by validating against project 1, but I have no idea where to start looking, and cant really find any decent answers on Google, please let me know if anything is unclear.p  pThanksp

Negative 1281 pIn an MVC App we are suppose to dynamically load some strings from database. Basically a codeltstring,stringgtcode keyvalue dictionary. Loading each text each time from the database would kill the application, so those texts would normally be pulled from the DB just once and then stored in cache namely codeWeb.HttpContext.Current.Cachecode. There are also default texts that are hardcoded and those would be used if nothing was found in the database. To make things more simple I would also put those default texts in the cache.p  pThe logic is as followsp  ol lipTry getting the text from cache and return it if its found.pli lipIf there was no text in the cache, try pulling it from the databaseand and if its found, save it to cache and return it.pli liIf all above failed, use the default text and save it to the cache so no further queries will be made for this particular key.li ol  pIf I understand it correctly the only way to check if key is set in codeWeb.HttpContext.Current.Cachecode is by comparing its value to a null. My problem is, its not entirely unlikely that the default text will be a null. So if I put that in the cache, I will not know that the key was set and I will try to pull the nonexistant value from the database each time the text is needed.p  pI know I could use an empty string instead of a null, but its possible that I might need to distinguish between nulls and empty strings for some reason in the near future.p  pSo is there some way to tell if a key is set in the codeWeb.HttpContext.Current.Cachecode when the value assigned is a nullp

Negative 1281 pYou have an i by j matrix. For the purposes of this example, take the following very small matrix. However, the algorithm should be fast and scalable.p  precodevalues lt c2,5,3,6,7,             9,5,4,9,9,             1,5,4,8,1,             3,1,5,6,2,             2,9,4,7,4 my.mat lt matrixvalues, nrow  5, byrow  TRUE codepre  pstrongObjectivestrong Iteratively remove rows or columns from my.mat such that meancapplymy.mat, 1, min, applymy.mat, 2, min is minimized given the number of rows and columns remove. Do so greedily so once a column or row is removed, it never returns to the matrix. In other words, simply remove the rows or columns with the largest minimum value. The following caveats apply.p  pFirst, if removing a row or column changes the minimum value of a column or row i.e., if they are each others minimum values, remove the row, column pair. If a row or column is paired with multiple columns or rows, iteratively remove the additional columns or rows until the pairing is 11, then remove the remaining pair simultaneously. Second, where there are ties, select randomly.p  pstrongOutputstrong A vector that indicates the order of removal according to this objective. It can either reference the rowcolumn names or it can reference the cell values, so long as it implies the correct order of removal. p  pSo for the matrix above, a correct answer is...p  precodeColumn 4, Row 2, Column 3, Either Row 1 or Row 5, Row 5 or Row 1, Column 1 or Column 5, Row 4 and Column 2, Column 5 or Column 1 AND Row 3 codepre  pHowever, the actual implementation shouldnt be undetermined. For instance, it should randomly choose Row 5 or Row 1, then remove the remaining row in a later step when appropriate.p  pIts very easy to imagine a very sloppy solution to the problem. However, it is hard to imagine a fast, vectorized solution. p  pIf there were no ties where columns and rows are not paired with each other and if there were not instances of multiple rows or columns paired with a single column or row, you could simply sort the unique row and column minima, then iteratively remove the rows and columns with minimum values equal to the emiem th value in the sorted minima. However, when there are ties, like in my.mat, this breaks because it would unnecessarily remove rows and columns that dont change the minima of a corresponding column or row. For instance, if a row is paired with two columns, they would all have equal minima, and so this crude algorithm would remove the row and both columns, when the correct answer is to remove at random one of the columns, then to remove both the remaining column and row. One potential solution to this problem is to jitter the values such that the correct ordering is implied, but as the matrix gets large, it becomes difficult to ensure that the jittering wont lead to incorrect orderings.p  pstrongEDIT 1strong Explaining the example p  pAndrewMacDonald raised a question about the example, so Ill explain the ordering. p  pThe minima for each row and column is as follows, where Ci, Ri are the emiem th columns, rows.p  precodeC4 R2 C3 R1 R5 R3 R4 C1 C2 C5   6  4  3  2  2  1  1  1  1  1  codepre  pThe first three steps are easy. C4, R2, and C3 are not minima for other rows or columns, nor are there any ties.

They obviously arent paired with each other nor are they minima for any columns, so we can remove them one at a time without changing the minima of any other row or column. We randomly pick between the two to determine the order. p  pstrong4 Row 1 or Row 5 Ill arbitrarily pick row 1strongp  precode   C1 C2 C5 R3  1  5  1 R4  3  1  2 R5  2  9  4 codepre  pstrong5 Row 5 or Row 1 whichever wasnt picked in step 4strongp  precode   C1 C2 C5 R3  1  5  1 R4  3  1  2 codepre  pThe remaining rows and columns are tied  1. You cant remove R3 because then C1 or C5 would get worse. But you can remove either C1 or C5 and not make R3 worse. Similarly, you cant remove R4 or C2 without making the other worse. So well have to remove R4 and C2 simultaneously. p  pThe final few steps are then, remove one of either C1 or C5, then the remaining two pairs R4 and C2, R3 and the remaining of either C1 OR C5.p  pstrong6 C1 or C5 Ill arbitrarily pick C5strongp  precode   C1 C2 R3  1  5 R4  3  1 codepre  pstrong7 R4 and C2strongp  precode   C1  R3  1  codepre  pstrong8 R3 and the remaining of either C1 or C5strongp  precode[] codepre  pNOTE Steps 7 and 8 are actually interchangeable.

Negative 1281 pI have two tables that both contain codeidprimary keycode, codecontactidcode and codenamecode.  I want to find out the differences between two tables. So, if one record in codetable Acode is different than codetable Bcode, the sql query should find it. For example, in the code below, code2,test2code does not appear in table B. So, the record code2,test2code is difference between two tables. However, we might have opposite situations such as one record appears in codetable Bcode but not codetable Acode. Or a records codecontactidcode could be the same in both table, but the codenamecode field can be different. In this case, the different record should also be returned.

Negative 1281 pI have a tablet app Im working on and I need to add a side panel that looks like a transparent overlay.  There are a couple different types of panels that will show up, so I have my main view laid out in a storyboard and am planning to pull in the panel from a .xib file.

Negative 1281 pWith the help of some users, they were able to provide assistance to read a text file, create new files in a group in a new folder with a specified count.  For instance, my text file that I am reading has 10,000 lines in this case.  I grouped it to read 1,000 lines and create a new folder each time.  The expected output should be 10 folders created with 2,000 objects in each folder 1 image file, 1 metadata file.  However, the actual output is 10 folders created with either plus or minus 2,000 objects in each folder.  The actual output also does not always put the respective 1 image file with its 1 metadata file together.  Some times they are in the same folder which it should be, while other times they are in separate folders which it should not be.p  pI stepped through the program and do not understand why this happens.  Below is the code that I have used to perform these actions above.p  precodeprivate string[] sourceline  new string[]  private string folder  string.Empty private int bs  1000  ...

As mentioned, it is not consistent with creating 2,000 objects per folder and does not always put both files in the same folders.  Any insight is greatly appreciated  Thanks all.p

If I comment an offending column out of my POCO, everything works.p  pHeres a pair of rows to illustratep  precode RDWYLINKID           RLCLINKOSET          SIGN                        1829                   1.51639964279667746989761971196153763602 1  14380                  578.483600357203322530102380288038462364 1  codepre  pThe first column is seen in .NET as strongintstrong, the second column as type a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comcdB2835901win.111b28375featTypes.htm relnofollowstrongOracleDecimalstronga, and the third as strongdecimalstrong. The second one is the problem. p  pFor example, removing Dapper for the moment and using vanilla ODP.NET to access these records thusly indicates the problemp  precodeint linkid  intreader.GetValue0 decimal linksign  decimalreader.GetValue2 decimal dlinkoffset  decimalreader.GetValue1 invalid cast exception at at Oracle.ManagedDataAccess.Client.OracleDataReader.GetDecimalInt32 i object olinkoffset  reader.GetValue1 same decimal dlinkoffset  reader.GetDecimal1 same object[] values  new object[reader.FieldCount] reader.GetValuesvalues same OracleDecimal linkoffset  OracleDecimalreader.GetProviderSpecificValue1 this works double dblinkoffset  reader.GetDouble1 interesting, this works too decimal dlinkoffset  linkoffset.Value overflow exception dblinkoffset  linkoffset.ToDouble voila codepre  pWhat little browsing and breakpointing Ive done in Dappers SqlMapper.cs file shows me that it is extracting data from the reader with GetValueGetValues, as above, which fails.p  pAny suggestions how to patch Dapper up  Many thanks.p  pUPDATEp  pUpon reflection, I RTFMed Section 3, Obtaining Data from an OracleDataReader Object of the a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comcdB2835901win.111b28375toc.htm relnofollowOracle Data Provider for .NET Developers Guidea which explains. For NUMBER columns, ODP.NETs OracleDataReader will try a sequence of .NET types from Byte to Decimal to prevent overflow. But a NUMBER may still overflow Decimal, giving an invalid cast exception if you try any of the readers .NET type accessors GetValueGetValues, in which case you have to use the readers ODP.NET type accessor GetProviderSpecificValue, which gives you an OracleDecimal, and if it overflows a Decimal, its Value property will give you an overflow exception and your only recourse is to coerce it into a lesser type with one of OracleDecimals ToXxx methods.p  pBut of course the ODP.NET type accessor is not part of the IDataReader interface used by Dapper to hold reader objects, so it seems that Dapper, by itself, is Oracleincompatible when a column type will overflow all .NET types. p  pThe question remains  do the smart folk know how to extend Dapper to handle this. It seems to me Id need an extension point where I could provide implementation on how to use the reader forcing it to use GetDouble instead of GetValue, or casting to OracleDataReader and calling GetProviderSpecificValue for certain POCO property or column types.p

Negative 1281 pWhen querying in DynamoDB with a hashandrange primary key, is it essential to provide the hash key or can you simply search by providing the range key This is my use case I have a table which has the following schema CategoryDomain String  Hash key GroupTypeGroupName String  Range key Some other string fields like UpdatedOn, UpdatedBy etc.p  pI have to frequently do there two things 1. Given a CategoryDomain, get all the matching items. 2. Given a GroupTypeGroupName, get all the matching items.p  pBoth the operations are fairly frequent so I do not want to use scan. Is there an effective way to do this in DynamoDB Is there a better way to design the schema more tables, secondary indexes etc. Any suggestion would be helpful. Someone suggested using Global Secondary Index but with that my question is will I be able to make the range key of my main table as the hash key of my gsi I know all the keys are copied over automatically but this would help me only if I can make GroupTypeGroupName as the hash key in the gsi so as to be able to query on it. Also, is there any special way to handle gsi from DynamoDBMapper Will I need to create a new POJO p

Negative 1281 pI have the following function to resize an image to fill its container div without skewing the image. It uses css to fill by height and if the image is not wide enough to fill the div then the function uses width to fill the div and sets height to auto. The problem is the code only works with window.load, so if the user is paying attention they can see the image load, then after a second it changes. So how would I change the function to work with document.ready p  precodefunction imageResize    .square.eachfunction     ifimg,this.width lt this.width         img,this.cssheight, auto         img,this.csswidth, 100          codepre  pEdit The problem with using document.ready with the current function is if the image is to big, the document is ready before the image has loaded.

Negative 1281 pI migrated to a new domain name and now use .PHP instead of classic .ASP. I successfully setup an .htaccess to redirect all the old .ASP requests to .PHP requests.

Negative 1281 pSo Im working on an implementation of a Grid class for a small, personal utilities library. After much work, Im tidying up the Grid class and adding some functionality. One of the key pieces of functionality that I wish to use with my Grid class is to be able to take a single, 2D array of any given type as an argument to the constructor.p  pThis worked fine until I realized that I cant compile any code that attempts to pass in any array of primitives to the constructor. Since autoboxing doesnt happen on primitive arrays, this presents a design problem to me in the form of code reuse. The method for initializing the Grid is the same regardless of the type of array passed in, even if they are primitives, but it appears that I need to write a separate constructor for all the different types of primitives. Which leaves me with 9 different constructors assuming I just use my base constructor and I had planned to have constructors with different arguments for things such as gridwrapping options. p  pAm I right in assuming that there is no way to avoid all this code duplication p

Negative 1281 pI am sorry but I am relatively new to the programming world and have run into an odd issue that I cannot overcome. At my company we use an open source ticketing system called Clocking IT version 0.99.3. Unfortunately, there does not appear to be any formal support for this program anymore which is why I am posting here. The issue that we are having is after the year change from 2014 to 2015 the login page no longer redirects to the home page after successful login, rather it redirects back to the login page to have you supply credentials again.p  pI validated this theory by setting the system time and date back to 12312014 160000 and can successfully log in, but if the date and time are restored to current that there is not successful login. p  pFrom what I know of the system, it is running in Linux using Apache  Ruby  and MYSQL. I have evaluated the logincontroller.rb file and cannot find anything that stands out as the issue. I appreciate any advice that you guys can offer and can retrieve logs or configs upon request. Thank you.p
Negative 1281 pI currently have the simplest of simple batch files ping 8.8.8.8 all it does is ping google 4 times, and report back the times, along with the minimum, maximum and average from the 4 pings. What I want to do is make it so that I can press a button on my keyboard I have a blackwidow, with macros enabled or maybe just open a program, and have it ping, then report back with only the max, min and average times, as an overlay in the corner. Is this possible within a batch file or do I have to move up to something more powerfulp
Negative 1281 pOur current code uses Azure SDK 1.8 and to generated a shared access signature it would first call codeCloudBlobContainer.GetBlobReferencecode and then call codeCloudBlob.GetSharedAccessSignaturecode.

Negative 1281 pGood afternoon everyone, in my WinApp I export data to a specific tab of an Excel spreadsheet, in which there are macros file extension .xlxm. In this workbook, the data is always inserted from the same cell when it is empty, but it can happen that has already had the previous entries, so you have to retrieve the first available blank cell on the new line after the one that has already had the data inserted. The sequence of entries in the cells is similar to the following in cells A1 A3, and then such as A10 A15, dropping the cells A4 to A9 because they are cells with formulas. I would to add that I must to control every cell of workbook for to fill in data from winApp. Ihope to be able to explain the scenario ... thanks to all in advancep
Negative 1281 pHi I have a project that involves uploading documents. I am using html for the front end and python for the backend. Ive managed to link my html and python file but Im having a problem with the server. At first I though it was a random thing but Im pretty sure its because of what I added to the python code. I havep  precodeimport cgi import sys import os  htmlform  cgi.FieldStorage filedata  htmlform[myfile]  if not fileitem.file return  name,ext  os.path.splitext fileitem.filename  if ext  .jpg or ext  .png or ext  .gif ioFlag  wb else ioFlag  w codepre  pI was able to log into my page go to the html form submit the form and got to a basic success html page I had below the above input. Now Im pretty new to python and didnt realise that the if statements should be indented. And I get a 500 internal error when I uncommented the if statement. I did it once and then went through commenting out my code being completely confused as to why I was getting error but after a while it just started working again. My guess is the incorrect if statement somehow got it stuck. I expect after about an hour itll be working again but ideally Id like to know if I could stop the process on the server if possible.

After few months i have started geeting configuration issues related to Impala. In order to avoid configuration issues we thought to remove Impala from our cluster as this is not in use I have performed below steps CM UI  Impala Instances Role TypeSelect all Role Type from Action Tab and select stop option . Once all the roles are stopped , go to CM UI  Impala Service drop down option and select Delete  and confirm. After perrmorming above steps it is giving  me a warning to first remove Hue,Oozie,Hive as they are the dependencies of Imapala as we have many users in Hue and many tables in Hive as the system is in production state, in last two months there are many users added and many tables are created in Hivep  pIf suppose i remove Hue Hive amp oozie to remove Impala then how to restore these service back in inital stage.

Negative 1281 pIn my application, there is a transparent codeInkCanvascode on top of a codeViewport3Dcode object. The codeViewport3Dcode shows a large 3D mesh. The user will sketch on the codeInkCanvascode in order to select a portion of the 3D model that the codeViewport3Dcode is rendering. The user is allowed to draw circles on the codeInkCanvascode.br When the user sketches, I iterate over all the points that fall inside of the drawn circle and I use the codeVisualTreeHelper.HitTestcode function to perform raycasting and determine which vertices of the codeViewport3Dcode mesh coincide with the sketch.  p  pThe problem is that codeVisualTreeHelper.HitTestcode is very slow. In case I used a codeParallel.Forcode I still would not be able to perform multiple raycastings on the Viewport3D in parallel due to the fact that the owning thread of the codeViewport3Dcode object is the UI thread and Id have to use codeViewport3Dcodes codeDispatcher.Invokecode function which will defeat the purpose of having a codeParallel.Forcode in the first place.p  pIs there a way to speed this up using multiple threads Better yet, is there an alternative solutionp

I am setting notification codesetAutoCancelfaslecode which make the notification to remain in notification area.p  pThe problem is if I got the notification and I am on the codeThirdActivity.classcode then it sets codeThirdActivity.classcode in PendingIntent to be open on notification click at first time now if the second time user clicks on notification then it should not open the codeThirdActivitycode instead it should open codeHomeActivitycode when user clicks on notification second time.p  pSetting class where classString is fetched depending on the state of the app as described earlierp  precodeIntent notificationIntent  new Intent         notificationIntent.setClassNamecontext, classString codepre  pSo how can I change the pendingIntent at run time after user have clicked it first time.p

Negative 1281 pIm working with SharePoint Lists, I have 2 Lists for this issue i.e. Movies amp Theatres. Only one list is used tough, because Theatres reference a movie. p  pI know this is weird but Im not actually working with movies and theatres, its just using an analogy so anyone could understand the problem so lets assume each Theatre only plays a single movie P p  pSo from the Theatres list I create a dataset with following fields LinkedMovie Title, Country, TheatreNumber.p  pI want to create a report that shows a tablix that lists all Movietitles with all the countries its shown in and a count of the theatres that are playing that movie. So the tablix should look like example belowp  precodeMovieTitle  Country     of theatres                        Movie 1     Country A  5             Country B  10 SubTotal            2  15                         Movie 2     Country C  15 SubTotal            1  15                        Total               3  30 codepre  pI have already created a tablix which groups on LinkedMovie first and Country second. Then in the detailssection I just count the theatres that play that certain movie in that specific country. To achieve this I created a second dataset with the exact same data so I could use emLookUpSet.Lengthem. But even though my calculations are correct the tablix still generates a row for each individual theatre. So my tablix actually looks like example belowp  precodeMovieTitle  Country     of theatres                        Movie 1     Country A  5                        5                        5                        5                        5  ....       ...        ... codepre  pSo if anyone knows how I would be able to achieve a tablix like the first example that would be greatly appreciated.p  pIf anything is still unclear please dont hesitate to ask.p  pKind regards Gravincop

Negative 1281 pOk i have a bundled .json file that I am looking to parse with swifty json. The model I am using in swifty json is a top level object that has an array of objects that each contain values of either strings or ints. I was wondering what code I need to create in order to make this. Anyone help in this matter is appreciated. I am new to coding in general and while I actually understand the sequence of most coding this parse function is a bit difficult for me to really grasp. If someone could make me a example code and explain what each part of it does that would be extremely helpful. Lets say I just want to pull one value out of one of the objects and use put it in an array to display in a uitableview. Hope this was clear and any help would be amazingp

Negative 1281 pI would like to replicate a table call this table codesource tablecode to a readonly table call this table codedest tablecode in the same database. I have only found information regarding publishing and subscribing across different databases. Is functionality to replicate a table in the same database supported in Microsoft SQL Serverp  pThis need arises from the fact that we have a very complicated and not easy to change process that updates and inserts records into the codesource tablecode, and since this process was created, weve developed a need to query the codesource tablecode, which has caused intermittent conflicts i.e. our process that updates the codesource tablecode is temporarily blocked while other queries are running. And we need to avoid these blocksdelays to our process. Our queries on the codesource tablecode are always lower priority. p  pAll of the queries that run against the codesource tablecode are queried on indexed columns for speedefficiency and minimal table locking and most of the queries that are run against the codesource tablecode are completed codewith nolockcode hint for the same reason. Yet we still encounter locking problems that delay our process that updates and inserts new records to the codesource tablecode. p  pBased on everything Ive read regarding transactional replication, this should allow us to query the codedest tablecode as much as we want without locking the codesource tablecode. The problem with what I know about replication is that I would like my codesource tablecode and codedest tablecode to reside in the same database.p  pWorst case, I can replicate the codesource tablecode to another database on the same server and query across databases. I would prefer to avoid being forced to use two separate databases if there exists an option to complete this on the same database.p

Negative 1281 pI have a User model with some fields. Some of them will require feedback, are they correctly filled if not, specific message will be displayed on user profile.p  pThe problem is, how to represent invalid fields in database. My idea is to create another model call it ExtUser with OneToOneField to User. And ExtUser should have same fields names as User, but their types will be all boolean, determining whether field is filled in correctly. For example, if User has a field called emailp  precodeemail  models.CharFieldmaxlength100 codepre  pExtUser would have following fieldp  precodeemail  models.BooleanFielddefaultFalse codepre  pHeres a problem with this approach. How am I supposed to create fields in ExtUser Of course I can create them manually, but that would be breaking of DRY principle, and Im not going to do that. The question is, can I add fields to model dynamically, and have them in database so I assume it would require to be called before migratep  pI have django 1.8 and I dont want to use any external moduleslibraries.p  pIf someone has an another idea of how to represent that data in database, please add comment, not a reply  as this question is about creating fields dynamically.p
Negative 1281 pI have an endless set of objects in a queue in those will keep coming in the queue in variable rate.p  pI am trying to essentially stream writes of those objects to a database.

While the writes in batches is what I was after with this approach I would like to flush whatever is in the SqlBulkCopy buffer in the db otherwise it may stay there for hours.p  pExamplep  ul liBatch Size 10li li1 Million Objects arrive in the queueli liProcessingli liDatabase now contains 999,990 objectsli li10 objects in SqlBulkCopy buffer.li ul  pThe next item arrives in one hour. Therefore the database will be missing 10 items for 1 hour.p  pI would like to be able to control this aspect.p  pThanksp

Negative 1281 pWe actually have a 10Gbs servers and 1Gbs servers that coexist together temporary migrating solution [UDP traffic]. We would like to shape the traffic coming from the 10Gbs servers in order to avoid big bursts that the 1G servers could not handle.p  pIt seems that tc cannot do the job with a tbf or maybe we use it the wrong way. For instance on our 10G servers we tried the followingp  psudo tc qdisc add dev eth5 root tbf rate 950mbit latency 1s burst 50mbit peakrate 1000mbit mtu 1500p  pHere we normally set the peakrate at 1mb which normally cant generate burst  1mbs. Unfortunately, that does not work, in fact after using this tc config, we lower our main bandwidth to at max 2Mbs.. p  pOur only clue for this strange behavior is that sentence in the tc manualp  pTo achieve perfection, the second bucket may contain only a single packet, which leads to the earlier mentioned 1mbits limit. p  pThis limit is caused by the fact that the kernel can only throttle for at minimum 1 jiffy, which depends on HZ as 1HZ. For perfect shaping, only a single packet can get sent per jiffy  for HZ100, this means 100 packets of on average 1000 bytes each, which roughly corresponds to 1mbits. p  pSo, its sure we cant have a peakrate  1Mbits p  pMaybe, there is another completely different way to achieve our goal, if anyone has a suggestion that would help me achieve our goal..  p  pKind regardsp

They are displayed vertically in page and when user clicks on say number 3 browser should alert in box 3. Everything in terms of designdisplay is working.

Negative 1281 pIm trying to use Bullet physics along with either ODE or Newton depending on which one I can get working inside my multi device firemonkey c application. The problem that I keep running into, however, is that these libraries dont seem to cater for C builder. They each register their own custom types through conditional defines. For example, theyll use int64 when detecting MSVC or long long with ming or gcc to type their own big ints. These types are not set within C builder because c builder doesnt set any environment defines that the libraries check for so the build fails.p  pIm no pro with c, so Im assuming Im doing something wrong here. What is the best way to handle this kind of situationp  pAs a side note, Im including the source files in the project so that it will build the physics library with any of the platforms I decide to build with so Im not using anything prebuilt.p

Negative 1281 pWere integrating with a single signon interface which provides a very nice remote JavaScript call to retrieve user information.  The library we reference via a remote URL even changes the state of the loginlogout links and provides a bit of user data their name and whatnot when they have already authenticated.  The resource returns a Json object which we parse, and then update the session state within our app to maintain their user information.p  pOur issue is that ASP.NET serves the HTML and completes its Page Load eventweb forms before the JavaScript object has been called and completed, and more importantly before the data is returned and the Ajax call is made to the server to update session.  The result is an onpage flash caused by JavaScript it starts off as logged out and then switches to logged in once the script has finished and pages that load in an incorrect state causing us to redirect the user needlessly.p  pHas anyone every played with preventing the page from loading prior to that remote script completing  I know we can hide the body content until the script has finished, which will eliminate the flashing and create an annoying wait for our users, but that wont eliminate our latent session issue.p  pAny ideas Thanks in advance.p  pBDp

Negative 1281 pI am doing some boolean operation on Nef polyhedra converted from regular polyhedra. After doing the boolean operation I want to convert the resulting Nef polyhedra into regular polyhedra. However it seems that Nef polyhedra only support if the result is a single volume. Some boolean operations however result in multiple volumes. Is there a way to split the Nef polyhedron into into the discrete volumes it contains and convert these back to regular polyhedra separately Alternatively is there some more appropriate approach p  pI have found the Nefpolyhedron3Volume and the corresponding iterator, but i have not been able to identify a way to utilize these to split up the Nef Polyhedron.p
