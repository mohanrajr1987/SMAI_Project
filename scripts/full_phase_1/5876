Positive 5876 pIve gotta solve this once and for all.p  pIm currently working on a 4 years old project, written in PHP and that is run on Apache server.br We are a team of about 40 folks and each of us uses the prefered OS, so we have Windows, Macs and Linuxes running this code. Im among those who prefer Ubuntu.p  pAnyway, everytime I clone this project, I have to modify some portions of code so itll work in my machine, because of the following old codeincludecodecoderequirecode issuebr So suppose I have the following files and dirsp  precoderoot    index.php    framework        index.php        framework.php    config.php codepre  pSummarizingp  ul licoderootindex.phpcode does coderequireframeworkindex.phpcodeli licoderootframeworkindex.phpcode does coderequire..config.phpcode and coderequireframework.phpcodeli liObviously, the code above gives me an error on the first coderequirecode, because its looking for codeconfig.phpcode in the directory in which coderootcode folder is located at.li ul  pYes, I do know that we should use some constants like codedefineROOTDIR, pathcode or use codedirnameDIRcode inside requires. My problem is that strongthis very code runs flawlessly on some machines around herestrong including the production server, which also runs Ubuntu LTS, so its believed that strongthis error is due to an Apache or PHP configurationstrong. I must run this code locally for development, but therere just too many codeincludecode and coderequirecode, and they wont let me change all of the original projects coderequirecode so it contains codedirnameDIRcode or whatever buit in it, as its believed to be unecessary.p  pSo, please dont suggest me to do anything to the preexisting coderequirecode calls. I need to know how to change PHP or maybe another services configuration so when it requires files, itll check them in relation to the script that is requiring the files, not in relation to the very first script that started this coderequirecode chain.p  pMaybe this is not relevant, but everytime I reinstall Apache2 and PHP5 on my Ubuntu LTS 14.04, its default configurations are so that this code doesnt run. One of my coworkers, who uses Windows used to run 8.1, now hes running 10, never has this problem, as in Windows apparently the XAMP or WAMP or whatever he uses has default configurations that will allow this code to work.p  pPlease help. Thanks in advance.p

Positive 5876 pIn apache2, we only allowed contact with our company wiki from the headquarters ip address.  Headquarters moved and we lost our network guru at the same time.

Positive 5876 pI have a shared hosting server where each subdomain is in its folder in root. The codewww.domain.comcode is in the codewwwcode folder, the codesubdomain.domain.comcode subdomain is in the codesubdomaincode folder, etc. p  pWhat I want right now, is to restrict access to codesubdomain.domain.comcode with a code.htaccesscode password, but show a customized message for users who dont have a password. And I cant get Apache2 to read the 401 error document. I have found some common troubleshooting saying that the file has to be readable, which in my case it definitely is. p  pSo, the only two places where I can put the auth file in this configuration, since codesubdomaincode is protected, is either under the codewwwcode folder, or in the root like code401.htmlcode, which I have no idea if it makes any difference. But in both cases, those are folders obviously readable by Apache2, because I am using them, I am using the other main domain for PHP scripts, and I am getting error logs in the root, the file permissions are the same as on the 404 document which works, and the owner is the same. p  pAnd I dont think my hoster is disabling me from using custom 401 error documents I am already successfully using custom 404 and 500 documents, because only when I try to specify a 401 document, I get an additional row in my error output that says codeAdditionally, a 401 Authorization Required error was encountered while trying to use an ErrorDocument to handle the request.code. As if its trying to do it, but there is something else in the way. p  pWhat could it be, and what should I try p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pThis is the contents of the code.htaccesscode file p  precodeOptions Indexes FollowSymLinks RewriteEngine On  RewriteRule [.] index.phpdata1 [QSA,L]  AuthName Restricted Area AuthType Basic AuthUserFile subdomain.htpasswd AuthGroupFile devnull require validuser  ErrorDocument 404 tplerrors404.php ErrorDocument 500 tplerrors500.php ErrorDocument 401 authalpha.html codepre  pAnd what Im noticing right now pasting this, is that my 404 messages are an absolute path starting with the codehttpcode address, not the root of the file system, which means that if I start the 401 error document with a codecode, it will try to read it from the same domain Which makes little sense to me, because it should be an Apache2 directive, not a browser directive, right Anyway, when I tried putting code..authalpha.htmlcode instead of codeauthalpha.htmlcode, then the browser outputs ONLY the string code..authalpha.htmlcode on the page.  p

Negative 5876 pI have a Windows Form C .NET 3.5 with a number of buttons and other controls on it, all assigned to a topmost Panel which spans the whole Form. For example, the hierarchy is Form  Panel  other controls.p  pAs soon as I assign a BackgroundImage to the Panel, the controls draw very slowly. I have the same effect if I use the Forms BackgroundImage property and set the Panels BackgroundColor to transparent. It appears as if the window with the background is drawn first, then each control is added onebyone each with a slight delay before the next is drawn. In other words, you can actually follow the order in which each control is drawn to the Form. Once all Controls have been drawn once this effect doesnt happen anymore but the responsiveness of the Form is still slow.p  pIn Visual Studios designer I get the same effect, especially noticeable when moving controls around. Sometimes the forms drawing stops completely for a second or two which makes working with BackgroundImage a total drag, both in the designer and the resulting application.p  pOf course, I tried using DoubleBuffered  true, and I also set it on all controls using reflection, to no effect.p  pAlso, heres the forms loading code because its a bit unusual. It copies all controls from another form onto the current form. This is done in order to be able to edit each screens visual appearance separately using the designer while sharing a common form and common code basis.

Could anyone offer some suggestionsp  h1Edith1  pI suppose the main problem Im having with this is simulating the codeyieldcode statement. As I understand it, it is a pretty simplelooking, but in reality complex, statement it creates a generator with its own codeitercode and codenextcode methods which are called automatically. Searching through the docs, it seems to be associated with the a hrefhttpdocs.python.orgcapigen.htmlPyGenObjecta however, how to create a new instance of this object is unclear. codePyGenNewcode takes as its argument a codePyFrameObjectcode, the only reference to which I can find is a hrefhttpdocs.python.orgcapireflection.htmlcodePyEvalGetFramecodea, which doesnt seem to be what I want or am I mistaken. Does anyone have any experience with this they can sharep  h1Further Edith1  pI found this to be clearer when I essentially expanded what Python was doing behind the scenesp  precodeclass IterObject     def initself, max         self.max  max     def iterself         self.i  0         return self     def nextself         if self.i gt self.max             raise StopIteration         self.i  1         return self.i  class Sequence     def initself, max         self.max  max     def dataself         return IterObjectself.max codepre  pTechnically the sequence is off by one but you get the idea.p  pThe only problem with this is its very annoying to create a new object every time one needs a generator even more so in Python than C because of the required monstrosity that comes with defining a new type. And there can be no codeyieldcode statement in C because C has no closures. What I did instead since I couldnt find it in the Python API empleaseem point me to a standard object if it already exists was create a simple, generic generator object class that called back a C function for every codenextcode method call.

Negative 5876 pA friend has asked me for help with her website design. Although I know a fair amount about the basics behind HTML, XML, Php, ASP.Net, javascript, etc., Im not really comfortable sitting down and coding from scratch. All of the work I do is in Java, C, and so on.p  pMy friend would like to add a vertically scrolling marquee to her site  no problem, there is code for that all over the internet. Here is the tricky part  she would like the text to be dynamically pulled from another website. This isnt like a simple text file, either  its a list of names from a specific blog post, so there would be a lot of text processing involved to wade through all of the other markup, and extract the relevant info.p  pThe way I see it, here are her options  p  p1 Write some kind of a perl script or somesuch that is set to run daily. This script will visit the blog and extract the necessary info. It will then update the HTML files marquee text with its new info.p  p2 Some sort of active page written in ASP or PHP that will dynamically build the marquee and the rest of the site each time the site is visited, basically doing the work of the perl script each time. This seems like it has the potential to be somewhat slow.p  pPer my understanding, those are her only options. Am I correct There is no simply way to do this in javascript that I am just missing I know you can reference an image to be dynamically pulled with the marquee, but this isnt that simple...p  pThanks.p  pEDIT I guess where I was going with my question was this Unless I implement this statically, this is going to be fairly involved, right I believe it is over my head. This is why I would like to simply copypaste the text list into the html document. It would need to be updated every time the blog does, but that only appears to happen every few months, so thats not a large chore. I realize this is a lazy solution, but this is from someone very inexperienced in web development.p  pFor reference, this is the SPECIFIC blog post which the text will come from, and my friend would ONLY like to display that list of names that begins when you scroll several paragraphs down.p  pa hrefhttptruthnottasers.blogspot.com200804whatfollowsarenameswhereknown.html relnofollowhttptruthnottasers.blogspot.com200804whatfollowsarenameswhereknown.htmlap

Negative 5876 pConsider this somewhat of a follow up to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1534626arethereanyupdatesoflocalizationsupportinc0xthis questiona.  Essentially, the C datetime formatting facilities seem to be hopelessly broken  so much so that in order to do something as simple as convert a datetime string into an object, you really have to resort to either Boost.Datetime or good old C codestrftimecodecodestrptimecode facilities.  p  pThe problem is that neither of these solutions work directly with the C locale settings imbued onto a particular iostream object.  The C facilities use the global CPOSIX locale settings, whereas the IO facilities in Boost.Datetime seem to bypass iostream locale settings entirely by allowing the user to directly set the names of months, weekdays, etc., regardless of locale.p  pSo, I wanted something that would respect the locale settings imbued onto a particular IO stream that would allow me to convert a string into a codestruct tmcode.  It seemed easy enough, but I ran into obstacles around every corner.  At first, I noticed that some implementations of the STL provide a nonstandard codestdtimegetgetcode function, so I decided to implement something similar.  Basically, I would simply iterate over the format string and whenever I hit a format flag, I would use one of the timeget facilities like getmonthname, getweekday, getyear, etc. to convert the input string into a codestruct tmcode.  This seems easy enough, except each one of these functions requires an exact iterator range.  You cant convert codeMonday,code, it has to be codeMondaycode exactly, or the conversion fails.  Since the iterators have to be codeistreambufiteratorcode, you cant simply scan ahead, because each increment changes the get position in the stream buffer.  So, basically you have to first iterate over the stream, copying each character into emanotherem streambuffer, and then when you hit a delimiter like a space or a comma, use the second streambuffer with the timeget facilities.  Its literally as if the C designers went out of their way to make this as annoying as possible.p  pSo, is there an easier solution  What do most C programmers do when they need to convert a datetime string to an object  Do we just have to use the C facilities, and lose the advantages that come along with different locale settings imbued on different iostream objectsp

Negative 5876 pI followed the excellent post by Nadia here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions860055jqueryoverridedefaultvalidationerrormessagedisplaycsspopuptooltiplikehttpstackoverflow.comquestions860055jqueryoverridedefaultvalidationerrormessagedisplaycsspopuptooltiplikea and it works great. But the form i am working on is submitted via ajax and a table above the form is updated when succesful The table grows with each submit and the position of the form slides down on the page as a result. Nadias solution postions the error message when the errorPlacement function is called. The problem is that errorPlacement is only called the 1st time an error occurs. When the user corrects the error the div is hidden but not removed. So the next time there is a validation failure the validate function only replaces the html of the div wrapper. As a result the absolute position is off because it was calculated relative to the input before the table was modified. Has anyone run into this and have a workaround Below is the errorplacement function that i am using which is straight out of Nadias solution in the linked post.p  precodeerrorPlacement functionerror, element                      offset  element.offset                     error.insertBeforeelement                     error.addClassmessage   add a class to the wrapper                     error.cssposition, absolute                     error.cssleft, offset.left  element.outerWidth                     error.csstop, offset.top                  codepre

Negative 5876 pThis is my problem I can build a binary in one of two ways and each has checks that can be done on them under their own make targets I would like a codecheckcode target to run whichever target is appropriate dependent on which build target was run under a previous call of codemakecode can this be done internally without touching files or some other external way of recording which build target was runp  pAn illustration may helpp  precode.PHONY all modified all obj     CXX ... o BIN  modified obj extraobjs     CXX ... o BIN   .PHONY check checkall checkmodified checkall all     ...  checkmodified modified     ...  check       Some makefile variable I dont know about codepre  pso that I can ask this of the shellp  precodemake X        lt X  all, modified ...           lt this is important this is not a question of target dependency make check    lt have check run checkX target codepre  pI figure that the only way for a particular codemakecode call to know which target was run before is by determining if it needs updating or not. Id est, if codeallcode is uptodate, then run codecheckallcode, if codemodifiedcode is uptodate then run codecheckmodifiedcode, and default to codecheckallcode.p  pSo, can I ask codemakecode internally whether target X would be updated if I asked to run it Internal meaning no calling of codeMAKE ncode, or no codetouch Ycode and then asking the shell codeif [ f Y ] ...code.p  pAs you can see, its not quite a question of dependency because that, clearly, will build the dependency when all I want to do is check to see whether it has been run before. So, any ideas or alternative suggestionsp  pUPDATEp  pOK, I guess the answer is No. The best I can probably do is thisp  precode.PHONY check check if wildcard firstword extraobjs,checkmodified,checkall codepre  pObviously, this method is functionally the same as creating a file when creating one of the targets and then checking for that, but in this case the file Im checking for is created anyway and unique to the target that creates it, which I suppose makes it slightly less ugly.p  pNote I ran into the problem thatp  precode.PHONY check check     MAKE q modified ampamp MAKE checkmodified  MAKE checkall codepre  pwont exactly work for the code I had above because codeallcode and codemodifiedcode are phony and so will always need updating as far as codemakecode is concerned, so that kind of rules that one out But, its a simple and concise way of solving the problem for targets named after the file theyd create so Ill mention it for reference.p

But there may be some other difference that is crucial lurking here  I have asked the resident ClearCase Guru about this.  However, it looks as though the difference is more likely in the configuration on the two machines than it is some versionspecific change in functionality.  Both versions superficially support the codenosuidcode option, even though neither is selfevidently invoking that option  except that the 7.1.1.1 version is managing to invoke it where the 7.0.1 version is not.p

Negative 5876 pstrongScenariostrongp  pI have a server process implemented in Python and gevent, which is connecting to a backend service over TCPIP and serving many Web clients 1000 per process with fast changing dynamic content based on the changes delivered by the backend service. The service is running on Ubuntu 10.04 and wont run on Windows, so the target platform is fixed. Were using Python 2.6.6, currently.p  pstrongProblemstrongp  pServing the changes to that many clients can cause a lag in processing the changes sent by the backend, so my plan is to split the server into multiple processes. A number of worker processes would serve the Web clients, while the main process would still be connected to the backend service. Im already using a separate pool of greenlets to serve the Web clients, but they need to be put into worker processes.p  pstrongQuestionstrongp  pCould you please point me to a working process pool implementation for gevent or figure out how can I use Pythons own multiprocessing module with gevent the right wayp  pstrongRestrictionsstrongp  pI would like to avoid introducing Python threads into our processes, since that would give room for GIL contention, which would reduce performance by introducing latencies. So it would be a clean multiprocessing  gevent solution, if possible.p

Negative 5876 pWe are just putting user input into our game so the user can enter email address etc. The entire game is Gl with no iOS UI at all. The EAGLView does not change orientation, it is always in portrait, however the game is in landscape and we handle this with a camera transform.p  pWe want to bring up the iOS keyboard and overlay a UITextView for the text input. The UITextView is a subview of the EAGLView. Obviously it, and the keyboard, shows up in portrait as the EAGLView is in portrait.p  pWithout having to change the EAGLView to landscape is there any way I can force the UITextView and the keyboard to show up in landscape orientationp  pIf I do change the orientation of the EAGLView to landscape to get this working, is there any hit on performance I have read several times that orienting a GL view in anything other than the default portrait view will give a performance hit, although I cant find any solid evidence of this.p  pThanks,p

I think CityZipCode is 10n I have read others saying this is not always the case but they never provided evidence.  If they are correct then I guess this would be a manytomany relationship.

Negative 5876 pFrom my understanding, when a process is under execution it has some amount of memory at its disposal. As the stack increases in size it builds from one end of the process disregarding global variables that come before the stack, while the heap builds from another end. If you keep adding to the stack or heap, eventually all the memory will be used up for this process.p  pHow does the amount of memory the process is given get determined I can only imagine it depends on a bunch of different variables, but an asgeneralaspossible response would be great.

Negative 5876 pIm trying to get around the ugly conditional casting involved when interpreting an update call for an observable that will want to notify its observers of multiple types of events. Also, Id prefer not to pass flags to the notifyObserversupdate method. p  pI do not want the observers to have to poll the observable object to find out whats changed, Id like this new data to be given to the observers via the update method or similar.p  pI have an idea for a solution. I instanciate one observable object for each type of notification. For example The observable is an object representing a hardware device, it will contain observables representing its statep  precodepublic final Observable connectionState  new Observable public final Observable dataState  new Observable  codepre  pThis way, observers dont need to do any sort of querying or conditional casting, as one observer, i.e. one overridden update method can be used per notification type.p  pAfter much frustration this is the most elegant solution I can think of, however I have this horrible feeling that Ive missed the point about how to use ObserversObservables properly.p  pMy main issues with that solution arep  ol liIt still involves a cast at least its not conditionalli liSince the observables need to be observable, they must be public members. While this does allow observers to call addObservable, it also allows them to call notifyObservers.li ol  pAm I doing the right thingp  pThanksp

As far as I know I only have one file open at a given time, so the exception doesnt make sense. p  pAfter some more debugging I found out the following using the process explorer.p  pWhen running locally the process starts with 400 handles probably because of .NET then when I press the start button the number of handles increases to 600 quickly, then it decreases to 400, then rises to 600, etc... This is probably the Garbage Collector kicking in, keeping the number of file handles down.

I could then harvest the BinariesContentSatellites to get the items I need in my fragment and then set a single Directory Id that I can reference in the main product WXS.

In onItemClick method, I handle navigation and change the background color of the clicked item so it appears as selected. Ive created a separate xml file for this and include it in every other xml file I have. So, instead of having tabs serving as a host to my activities, my every activity serves as a host to tabs.. this doesnt seem like a very neat solution.  is there a better way to implement thisp
Negative 5876 pOkay, I have a somewhat complicated form with a lot of complicated business logic, and as a result Im actually generating fields on the fly when the form is created. I need to be able to access the fields in the template but of course since theyre generated I cant just do something like code form.fieldname code because in this case codefieldnamecode is actually made from a variable.p  pI tried something like this in the formp  precodedef initself, args, kwargs      initialization code is here, so lets just skip that     self.items  kwargs.popitems, []     self.myfields  []     for item in self.items         self.fields[itemd  item.pk]forms.CharFieldrequiredTrue, labelitem.name         self.myfields.appendself.fields[itemd  item.pk] codepre  pHowever, in the template, when I try thisp  precode for field in self.myfields       field   endfor  codepre  pI get something like codeltdjango.forms.fields.CharField object at 0x2b08aeb45810gtcodep  pIs there a way to do this so I can get the actual rendered fieldp  h1Updateh1  pLooks like rendered fields have a type codedjango.forms.forms.BoundFieldcode and are created when codegetitemcode is called on the codefieldcode object. Basically, I guess I need some way to create something that behaves like codehiddenfieldscode only contains my fields instead.p

Negative 5876 pI have a web application that uses AJAX to grab JSON data from the server. It requires that the user first log in with their browser so that a cookie can be set.

Negative 5876 pI am in the process of building a web application and have been tasked with building a pretty tricky visual requirement.  p  pI need a way to display visual representations of entities in circles.

There can be n number or circles.p  pIf I was forced to do it from scratch, some suggestions on how to approach it would be appreciated.p  pAlso, the circles should be draggable.  If I wanted to remove perl from my canvas, I should be able to just drag it into a trash can. Feel free to comment for questions andor clarifications.p  pOne last thing, each section of the circles should be clickable.  In otherwords, if I click on the object oriented intersection, I should fire an event that fetches languages that are object oriented.p

Negative 5876 pIm currently developing an iOS application iPad and iPhone that uses OpenGL ES 1.0 to render some basic textures. I use atlases to store and present my textures.p  pMy main atlas is relatively large 2000x2000 but my internal algorithms load and resize the texture to 2048x2048 since OpenGL ES only accepts power of 2 sized textures. Im able to draw the tiles, everythings fine on this side.p  pIm facing a serious memory leak every time I try to load and unload destroy the texture. This should happen in the final version but I needed to make sure that my loading and unloading were fine. In memory the texture occupies 2048x2048x4 RGBA bytes  16MB approx. This is a huge amount of bytes so you understand that the problem is pretty annoying to me iOS kills the application after a few minutes..p  pWhen I load a texture, Instruments indicates that the overall memory used by the application increases by 16MB this is correct I use the Real Memory column. The problem occurs when I need to destroy the texture to free all the possible bytes used by it it never looses the 16MB...and since I load and unload in a loop, the memory keeps being used and never freed.p  pHeres how I load the texturesp  precodeGLubyte outData  mallocdataWidth  dataHeight  4  sizeofoutData GLuint texture  declared as un instance variable so its address never changes glGenTextures1, amptexture glBindTextureGLTEXTURE2D, texture glTexParameterfGLTEXTURE2D, GLTEXTUREWRAPS, GLCLAMPTOEDGE glTexParameterfGLTEXTURE2D, GLTEXTUREWRAPT, GLCLAMPTOEDGE glTexParameterfGLTEXTURE2D, GLTEXTUREMINFILTER, GLLINEAR glTexParameterfGLTEXTURE2D, GLTEXTUREMAGFILTER, GLLINEAR glTexImage2DGLTEXTURE2D, 0, GLRGBA, dataWidth, dataHeight, 0, GLRGBA, GLUNSIGNEDBYTE, outData freeoutData codepre  pHeres how I unload the texture this is called, I checkedp  precodeglDeleteTextures1, amptexture codepre  pI used glGetError everywhere to check if an error occurs but it always returns 0 even after  the glDeleteTexture.p  pDoes anybody have an idea Thank youp

Negative 5876 pIm creating a Custom Membership Provider to be shared across all my MVC3 and ASP.NET applications.  I started with some sample code I found on CodeProject.

Negative 5876 pI evaluate SOA products of wso2 for few weeks and there are some basic and crucial to me features which I cannot finduse or maybe it just does not exist. I want to make sure.p  pFirst of all, creating IDE support. As probably most of you know wso2 team delivers Carbon Studio which is quite a nice thing. Unfortunately when it comes to team work so often importing existing projects into IDE I hit a wall becausep  p1 If I use Distribution Project Im required to commit .projects files which actually contains nature understand by Carbon Studio. It is acceptable but it is as well bad practice in my opinion.p  p2 If I use Maven then after import Im going to loose project nature so plugins are not going to work without preparing .projects.p  pAm I missing something I would like get rid of .projects and be able to use IDE on 100. Is it possible Cant it be generated or something. Normally plugins are trying to recognize file type and edit it with specified plugin. I understand that most Synapse configs for example are all XMLs but that is not a reason for me. Any way, does someone know some kind of solutionp  pAlso Distribution Project cannot be build from command line if known maven repositories cannot deliver some artifact. I can write maven plugin to implicitly build each wanted artifact but it is not something I want to do if maven can do it for me. And I cannot use maven because after import Ill lose IDE features.p  pTo me IDE is useless if Im required to fix each project before actually importing it. Time is very precious.p  pThe second important and unacceptable feature is importing jars into project when using, for example, generators. Why created project cannot be configured to use dependenciesp  pRobertp

Negative 5876 pI noticed while using an LDAP connect pool that calling codeclosecode on the context did not appear to return it to the pool, despite the documentation a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavasejnditutorialldapconnectpool.html relnofollowsayinga a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase6docsapijavaxnamingContext.htmlclose2829 relnofollowotherwisea. Thus when I attempt to get an item from the pool when it is already at its max size, it hangs.p  pI managed to narrow it down to a minimal case. Even though I believe Im calling codeclosecode on all of the relevant objects deterministically, it seems to rely on garbage collection to actually return objects to the pool, which is unexpected. strongWhy is this happening Is there some other object I should be closingstrongp  pIn the code snippet belowp  ul liIve artifically set the max pool size to 1 to highlight the problem.li liI get a codeDirContextcode from the pool line 2, attempt to return it to the pool line 4, then get another one from the pool line 6 which ought to return the same, returned object.li liinstead, the second request line 6 hangs on some internal call to codeObject.waitcode. Im guessing its waiting for a pooled object to become available.li liif turn off pooling by commenting out 1, it doesnt hang but I want pooling.li liif I comment out 3  a call to codeSearchResults.nextcode  it works fine.li liif I uncomment line 5 to force garbage collection between the return to pool call and requesting a new object to the pool, it does not hang.li ul  pSince commenting out line 3 makes the problem go away, perhaps Im not closing the return value of it correctly, and its holding the pooled connection open.

This is intended and no problem for the further execution of the program.p  pThe problem is that when the ISR is entered first and I press the button a second time while the ISR is executing this has to be done fast a pending interrupt is set and causes the ISR to execute again if it has ended for the first time. This is normal behaviour I guess, since EXTIClearEXTIFlag1 does not clear any pending interrupts in the NVIC. So I added NVICClearPendingIRQEINT1IRQn to clear the new pending interrupts on several locations in the ISR code to be sure the pending interrupts isare cleared. Strangely enough this does not work at all.p  pSome my question is, how can I read the pending interrupts via JTAGdebugger memory address. And what is going on here Can someone explain this behaviour and maybe has a clue how to fix itp  pThanksp

I know I had an issue like this in the past, but I guess Heroku changed support to stack overflow. I can no longer view my old tickets with Heroku. Any help would be much appreciated.p  pWhy is my App Haltingp  pEDIT I just deleted my app from heroku and created another app with the cedar stack. Fresh start. Pushed my local app to heroku. I get an application error when trying to view the page, and I still get the plugin error when I try running a codeheroku run rakecode command.p  pEdit I thought that there might be some sort of incompatibility with ruby versions. Log file has directory codefrom appvendorbundleruby1.9.1code but codeheroku run ruby vcode yielded 1.9.2. I updated my gemfile to include ruby 1.9.3 and pushed to heroku. Heroku is indeed running 1.9.3 just like my local env, but the log it puts out is still the same.p  pEdit I wiped out the db again, restarted the heroku app, and got a new log.p  pEdit I had an issue with my carrierwave initializer. Fixed. Pushed.

Negative 5876 pI have a question about best practices around serving varying representations of an resource. My use case is a bit more complex than simply serving representations of the object in different content types Say xml or json. p  pBackground This API is for a content management system. One crucial aspect of the API is that a user can request a zip file of a document, as well as all of its dependencies Linked images, and other documents.p  pFor instance, one might access a document at coderestalldocumentsdocidcode which would return  the XML representation of the document. p  pWhen designing a way for them to get a zip of the document and all its dependencies, I have come up with a few optionsp  ol liUse content negotiation and set the codeAcceptcode header to something vendor specific, ie vnd.company.compileddoczipli liUse a sub collection such as coderestalldocumentsdocidexportcode Export is a verb, so I am not sure if this is well standardizedli liProvide a service at a different URI which was read only coderestcompileddocumentsdocidcodeli ol  pAs this problem is likely to come up again and again I am having a really hard time determining what is going to be best way to design this part of the API. So far I am leaning towards option 3,p  pThanks,p  pCaseyp

Negative 5876 pIs there a way to copy an object from a reference range or cell for example to a variablep  pThe reason why I want to do this is because I have a huge macro that calculates a lot of things and uses many copypaste operations and it loops over many cells and alters them. This does not perform very well at all, so I wanted to minimize the GUI operations and work in the background, this way I could have the whole result in an array which I paste to the GUI in the end. The problem is that I need the objects not just the value of the cellsranges because I need also to alter other properties e.g. size or color.p

Negative 5876 pA quick introductionbr Were developing a positioning system that works the following way. Our camera is situated on a robot and is pointed upwards looking at the ceiling. On the ceiling we have something like landmarks, thanks to whom we can compute the position of the robot. It looks like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comKzIQj.png altenter image description herep  pOur problembr The camera is tilted a bit 04 degrees I think, because the surface of the robot is not perfectly even. That means, when the robot turns around but stays at the same coordinates, the  camera looks at a different position on the ceiling and therefore our positioning program yields a different position of the robot, even though it only turned around and wasnt moved a bit.p  pOur current hardcoded solutionbr Weve taken some test photos from the camera, turning it around the lens axis. From the pictures weve deduced that its tilted ca. 4 degrees in the up direction of the picture. Using some simple geometrical transformations weve managed to reduce the tilt effect and find the real camera position. On the following pictures the grey dot marks the center of the picture, the black dot is the real place on the ceiling under which the camera is situated. The black dot was transformed from the grey dot its position was computed correcting the grey dot position. As you can easily notice, the grey dots form a circle on the ceiling and the black dot is the center of this circle.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comnqbth.png altenter image description herep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comwVqEt.png altenter image description herep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comoxRbe.png altenter image description herep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comS2EzJ.png altenter image description herep  pThe problem with our solutionbr Our approach is completely unportable. If we moved the camera to a new robot, the angle and direction of tilt would have to be completely recalibrated. Therefore we wanted to leave the calibration phase to the user, that would demand takings some pictures, assessing the tilt parameters by him and then setting them in the program. My question to you is can you think of any better more automatic solution to computing the tilt parameters or correcting the tilt on the picturesp

Here are a few of my tries that have not workedp  precodeThis was my attempt to just count the results of a subquery on the subscribers table FAILED SELECT COUNT FROM SELECT COUNT as subscount FROM subscribes WHERE subscount gt 1 AS dummytable WHERE 1  This was my attempt to produce a count of the number of subscribers and count that FAILED SELECT COUNT FROM subscribes WHERE count gt 2 GROUP BY blogid  Im sure of how to get the number of subscribers to each blog irregardless of subscription count, that query looks as followed SELECT id, title, COUNT as subscount FROM blogs, subscribers WHERE blogs.id  subscribers.blogid GROUP BY blogid ORDER BY subscount DESC codepre  pHowever restricting that query to only return the blogs with 2 or more subscribes I cannot figure out yet. Thank you for your help and time all.p

Negative 5876 pHi for the print method to work on excel i need the printername and the port name like this printer On NE3 just as an example. The problem is, is that I use a virtual printer and the port is different, pretty much every time i need to use it.p  pThe program needs to run in the background, so open dialog boxes to choose is not an option. I have also tried to retrieve the port name from WMI with thisp  precode    protected string FindPrinterWithPortstring printerName              StringBuilder query  new StringBuilder         query.AppendSELECT  FROM Win32Printer          query.AppendWHERE DeviceID  printerName         ObjectQuery objectQuery  new ObjectQueryquery.ToString         var searcher  new ManagementObjectSearcherobjectQuery         foreach ManagementObject mo in searcher.Get                      return printerName  On  mo[PortName]                  return string.Empty      codepre  pThe portname i receive doing this gives me the full path to the virtual printer program. I previously used the methods below to change printer for excel, and i alway knew they should be changed eventually, the code is neither fast nor good, but it worked for a while, until I made it multithreaded and its just a big blockade.

I Changed it by usingp  precode    [DllImportwinspool.drv, CharSet  CharSet.Auto, SetLastError  true]     public static extern bool SetDefaultPrinterstring Name codepre  pAnd i lock it method and print. I have thought about trying to do a lock and save the ActivePrinter, even tho i believe performance will properly just as bad. Because the lock will stay until the default printer is changed, which takes sometimes up to 1 second, in a multithreaded envirorment thats is a very long lock.p  precode string printernamewithPort  string.Empty  lock ActivePrinterLock       SetDefaultPrinterprintername     printernamewithPort  excel.ActivePrinter    foreach Worksheet worksheet in workbook.Worksheets       worksheet.PageSetup.PaperSize  XlPaperSize.xlPaperA4     worksheet.PageSetup.Orientation  XlPageOrientation.xlPortrait     worksheet.PageSetup.FitToPagesWide  1      worksheet.PageSetup.FitToPagesTall  false     worksheet.PrintOutExActivePrinter printernamewithPort,Collate true, Preview false, PrintToFile false   codepre  pWhat i dunno is that, if the default printer changes right away from another thread, if it looses the port given to the virtual printer. I have not done proper testing of this. In normal circumstances it seems that my Method FindPrinterWithPort would work.p

Negative 5876 pI have a Visual Studio solution with a library project lets call it codelibFoocode, and an executable project  lets call it codeBarcode which depends on codelibFoocode.p  pWhen I change, for example, codelibFoobar.cppcode and attemp to build codelibFoocode then Visual Studio compiles my bar.cpp file, but does not regenerate the library codelibFoo.libcode, saying that it is already up to date.p  pI checked the system clock. I also verified that the modification time of the codebar.objcode file is actually updated and that the library is older than the obj. But it still does not recreate the library.p  pThe actual solution actually consists of around 100 projects, some of them are libraries and some of them are executables. The problem happens on the computers of 3 of my team members. The rest are unaffected. We have no idea why it happens, and how to fix it... or weather it might happen to the other team memebers.p  pI were not able to reproduce it by creating my own small solution with a library and an executable that depends on it. So I believe that this is some combination of an environment problem and a problem with our solutionproject files.p  pThanks, Alex.p  pstrongEditstrongp  pThe solution was created on Visual Studio 2010 and developed on VS2010 for the past years, until we started using VS2012. The problem happens for users having both VS2010 and VS2012 installed. The solution is a VS2012 solution now, and the projects use the VS2010 platform toolkit.p  pWhen we started using VS2012, our team migrated the solution but we left the platform toolkit for all the C projects to be that of VS2010, to allow compatibility of our code with the other teams still using VS2010.p  pGoogle did not reveal any plausible solution. Although it did reveal the fact that other people also encountered similar problems.p

I understand the technical differences quite well, but Im having a hard time getting to the core motivation of typeclasses.  The best motivation I found so far is the followingp  pWhile subclassing or implementing interfaces allows you to do mostly the same designs, typeclasses allow you to specify features of a type on a permethod basis, whereas a generic class with type codeTcode and upper bound codeUcode constrains codeTcode everywhere where it is used. With this in mind, typeclasses provide more finegrained control over features of T in generic classes.p  pAre there any very clear examples motivating the patternp

Negative 5876 pI need some help in training a SVM for an Android app.  I have a set of images in different classes 12 classes and got all descriptors from them. I managed to get the same amount of descriptors for each image. What I need is to train a SVM for my android application with those descriptors. Im not sure if I should train it in the Android emulator or write a C program to train the SVM and then load it in my app if I use the OpenCVs lib for windows to train the SVM and then save it, will the lib Im using for Android recognize the saved SVM file. I guess I shouldnt train the SVM with such big dataset in the emulator. Ive already tested my descriptors dataset on the SMO of Weka a hrefhttpwww.cs.waikato.ac.nzmlweka relnofollowhttpwww.cs.waikato.ac.nzmlwekaa and got good results, but I need to implement or use the openCVs SVM and save it trained for future classification.

Negative 5876 pI have opened a can of worms by using an old prebuilt project as the foundation for a new one. p  pWhen I open the old project in the simulator or on a device, it uses images and settings from the new app that arent even referenced or included in that original project.

Negative 5876 pstrongBACKGROUNDstrongp  pI have a a camera mounted on a car facing forward and I want to find the roadmarks. Hence Im trying to transform the image into a birds eye view image, as viewed from a virtual camera placed 15m in front of the camera and 20m above the ground. I implemented a prototype that uses OpenCVs warpPerspective function. The perspective transformation matrix is got by defining a region of interest on the road and by calculating where the 4 corners of the ROI are projected in both the front and the birds eye view cameras. I then use these two sets of 4 points and use getPerspectiveTransform function to compute the matrix. This successfully transforms the image into top view.p  pstrongQUESTIONstrongp  pWhen should I undistort the front facing camera image Should I first undistort and then do this transform or should I first transform and then undistort.p  pIf you are suggesting the first case, then what camera matrix should I use to project the points onto the birds eye view camera. Currently I use the same raw camera matrix for both the projections.p  pPlease ask more details if my description is confusingp

Negative 5876 pIn a JAXRS BookShop I want to filter customer recensions for xss content. For a JSF application I do this by applying a filter in web.xml which checks the value of the attached parameter for xss content. Since JAXRS webservices are receiving serialized obejects instead of parameter values it would be much easier to validate the content within the recension bean itself.  Hence, I am of the opinion that there is no reason to apply a xxs filter within a JAXRS services.  Am I rightp

Negative 5876 pFor an enterprise application framework im working on right now, im looking for a way to manage assets cleverly and simply from a developers perspective. Essentially, the scenario is one of applications metadata information being persisted on a relational database ie the name of the application, the different pages, the roles for that application, etc, accessed through a REST API in example, if i want to access to full application x metadata, i can navigate to applicationsx and get the representation of that application in terms of pages and components of each page.p  pThere is no code except by what we call components you may think of them as bundles of reusable cssjshtml. Now, the question is I have metadata of components on database in example, component id, component description, etc but also components code is on a file system under a versioned control system SVN in our case. Meaning that the component information is both on DB and file system.  So, if in example, some developer creates a component that is, commits code to a particular folder where components are persisted on file system i need to let the database know that there is a new component, and so it should be updated. On the other hand, if the API is used to remove a particular component something like DELETE componentscomponentId1 that would remove code on file system also.p  pSomeone would argue that code could be added as a blob to DB, but i still want to use a versioning system like SVN or GIT, so that is not an option. Also, working with code that is on a file system is much more simpler that code on a database.p  pSo, my question is if you can provide me with some ideas, approaches, etc. to know how could be implemented a solution for managing these kind of assets that lives both on a database and on a file system, and should be consumed  modified  created both from a file system and a REST api. p

Is it possible to handle thisp  pSay I post an object JSONp  pre classlangjs prettyprintoverridecode   prop1  123,   prop2  5  codepre  pAnd the response if not an object with properties codeprop1code and codeprop2code, as RestKit expects by default, but something elsep  pre classlangjs prettyprintoverridecode   data  [1,2,3,4,5,6],   message  hello world  codepre  pIve seen examples where operation.targetObject was set to nil, but I believe this is only in Core Data managed scenarios.p  pI am trying something simple like thisp  pre classlangobjc prettyprintoverridecodeRKObjectRequestOperation operation  [self.objectManager appropriateObjectRequestOperationWithObjectbody methodRKRequestMethodPOST pathitems parametersnil]  [operation setCompletionBlockWithSuccessRKObjectRequestOperation operation, RKMappingResult result      success is called, but the result does not contain what the response JSON is  failureRKObjectRequestOperation operation, NSError error     failure ]  [operation setWillMapDeserializedResponseBlockidid deserializedResponseBody       deserializedResponseBody is always nil ]  [operation start] codepre  pI thought I could be able to look at the response contents in the setWillMapDeserializedResponseBlock, but it is always nil.p  pBecause the posted object has codeprop1code and codeprop2code properties, and how RestKit works by default, it expects JSON with said properties. But, since the result has nothing to do with the posted object, codeprop1code and codeprop2code are just nil which I dont care for anyway.p  pBy the way, I have setup the request mapping correctly, so the codebodycode being passes in the operation object is correctly mapping my NSObject and sending it in the correct JSON format to the server.p  pIs there a way that I can make such a call with RestKit, and manually pull out what I am looking for on the success event Even if it was a dictionary representation of the JSON responsep

Negative 5876 pIn my OpenGL iOS application Im trying to implement the producerconsumer model where the producer needs to load the textures while the consumer needs to display them.

Negative 5876 pIve been working on a C application that embeds a prolog reasoning engine lately and, as stated in the title, I am now trying to generate a DLL instead of an executable so I can use it in another project. Since I am new to DLL development, I thought I could start with a small example. I have 3 filesp  ul licodelikes.plcode sample prolog file defining the predicate likes2li licodelikes.cppcode defining the function codegetfoodcode that calls codePlQuerycode and return the results in a codestdstringcodeli licodefood.cppcode using the DLL to list all kinds of food that Sam likesli ul  pSo my first try was the followingp  precodeswiplld shared dll o likes goal true likes.cpp likes.pl DLIKESEXPORTS v g o food.exe s food.cpp L. llikes I. Lcprogram files x86swipllib lswipl Icprogram files x86swiplinclude codepre  pFirst of all, let me point out that when codegetfoodcode only returns a string without any call to prolog, this works fine. However, after two days of investigation, I cant figure out how to get the DLL to call prolog. I think there are two things I am possibly doing wrong, maybe both the PlEngine intialization and the saved state.p  pIve tried both calling PlEngine in codegetfoodcode and in codefood.cppcode codemaincode function, same result. So for now I am sticking to the first option since I am more interested in having everything done in the DLL. I see here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13785922embeddingswiprologinadllEmbedding SWIProlog in a dlla that it can later be done in the codeDllMaincode but also that it is not recommended. What is the best way to do it Should I give food.exe ascodeargv[0]code or something else libswipl.dll a saved state p  pSecondly, I noticed that one difference when using swiplld to generate a DLL instead of an EXE is that it ommits the linesp  precodeswipl.exe f none F none g true tconsult[likes.pl],qsaveprogrampltmp4228.exe,[goaltrue,toplevelprolog,initfilenone] cat pltmp4228.exe gtgt food.exe codepre  pSo I tried to do it manually, replacing the random name by mystate.exe and using the Win32 codecopy bcode command to append it to food.exe. This makes food.exe a toplevel console where I can test codelikes2code. Is it because the Dll doesnt have any codemaincode Anyway, this is the furthest I could get for now and I guess there were a few things to change in the codeqsaveprogram2code second argument. I tried replacing codetoplevelprologcode with codestandalonetruecode. By the way, the command example given at the end of a hrefhttpwww.swiprolog.orgpldocdocforobjectsection282,272.1027,swi2827docManualcompilation.html272929 relnofollowhttpwww.swiprolog.orgpldocdocforobjectsection282,272.1027,swi2827docManualcompilation.html272929a doesnt generate any file at all.

Negative 5876 pWe have an onpremise CRM with rollup 13. Some of the forms need to be populated with external data that comes from multiple sources and needs to be preprocessed. To do this, we developed a custom WCF service that runs on the same server as CRM and is hosted in IIS as a virtual app in CRMs website to avoid crossdomain scripting issues and exposes a REST endpoint to the javascript that runs in CRM forms. The javascript makes requests, the service collects and processes data and then replies back to javascript with some nice simple JSON.p  pSince some of the data we need comes from CRM itself, we figured well let the service collect that also using CRMs SOAP endpoint, rather than making the requests from javascript to CRM web services directly. We have passthrough authentication set up in IIS, so our custom app makes requests to CRM while impersonating the user thats logged into CRM.p  pMost of the time, this all works great. However, once we got more testers we started noticing that occasionally CRM will stop replying to our service for some user, throwing an exception. If that user closes the browser and reopens it and then tries the exact same operation, it all starts working again. I turned on tracing on the CRM server and found that when this happens, CRM is logging Crm Exception Message The user Id is invalid., ErrorCode 2147214049.

Negative 5876 pI have a responsive website.  I already have...p  pcodeltmeta nameviewport contentwidthdevicewidth, initialscale1gtcodep  p...in the header. The website doesnt just scale everything down automatically to fit on a smartphone screen.  It maintains the proper size of my DIVs whether they be fixed or percentages and I design my elements to fit accordingly.p  pHowever, on one page, I have an interactive diagram with several elements.  These are blocks with text inside them, and they have to maintain fixed widths.  The problem is, these fixed widths are much larger than smartphone screens.  Its about 1000px wide.p  pI cant make this div percentage based.  It has to be at least 1000px wide and maintain that size on every device.  Obviously, this means that it will not fit on smartphone screens.p  pWhat I would like to do is continuing using...p  pcodeltmeta nameviewport contentwidthdevicewidth, initialscale1gtcodep  p...for every other element in my website, except this one DIV.  I need to scale the entire parent DIV, its child DIVs and the text inside of the child DIVs.p  pI have tried the CSS zoom property.  But, it doesnt scale the text properly, and the widths of the child DIVs dont seem to zoom equally.  They get out of alignment.p  pHow can I conditionally apply that meta viewport tag to everything except this specific, fixed width DIVp

Negative 5876 pUDP packets are sent to a Linux client. If those packets are not sent for a particular time interval1 min and sent again to the same UDP port, then the coderecvcode function returns 1 and error is codeEAGAINcode.

Why this problem occurs, when using a switchp  pAnd this problem was fixed temporarily, when the UDP client uses the send function to send dummy data to the server whenever coderecvcode function returns codeEAGAINcode error.

Negative 5876 pIm wondering if its possible to change the default behaviour of PHPs errorlog functionality to include the source and originating line number by default.p  pI am guessing this could be potentially be done either with a PHP ini setting or by configuring apache in some specific way, though not being an apache guru Im not sure how this would be made possible.p  pIn my default environment, finding the source of the errors in a log generally doesnt pose too much of a problem where the error is legitimately spawned by a PHP warning or notice, as it will report automatically where the line originates... however, calls made manually by programmers to PHP errorlog dont do this, and I cant find a way to make this behavior default.p  pI am aware that generally speaking you can achieve the line reporting manually with the magic constant like thisp  pcodeerrorlogFailed to login to MySQL .LINEcodep  pHowever, I am curious and open to suggestions about if there are any ways to perhaps configure the way errors are reported universally in the log or anything else to get around changing every single call in code to include the magic constant.p

Negative 5876 pI have a codeListViewcode in my app, that each row of the codeListViewcode will need to load multiple images from remote resources.i.e. the listview looks something like Instagram where each item contains at least one image.p  pI am implementing a twolevel cache to improve the load image experiencep  ol lipMy first level memory cache is defined like thisp  pcodeprivate MapltString, SoftReferenceltBitmapgtgt l1ImageCache  new HashMapltString, SoftReferenceltBitmapgtgtcode br that I could keep some SoftReference of the image in memory to make the app lookup faster.pli lipMy second level file cache is a folder on SD card or phone storage. Where I keep some of my already downloaded images in there. If the app could not find the image in the memory cache, it will come look up in the file directory. If the image file existing, it will load the file locally and put the file reference in to the memory cache as well.pli lipIf The app cannot find the needed image from either memory cache or file cache, it will use a codeImageDownloadWorkercode extends codeAsyncTaskcode to kickoff a thread and download the image. However, android could only allow as many as 128 threads per app, I am thinking a way to save some threads. The I created this data structurep  pcode keep all pending downloadscode  brcodeprivate HashMapltString, ImageDownloadWorkergt downloadTaskMap           new HashMapltString, ImageDownloadWorkergtcode brIn which the String field will be the URL to download. This is to check if a thread to download a certain URL is already running, so I dont have to start another thread to download the same thing.pli ol  pbMy question isb According to the code, suppose one case that the app is about to download an image. The image is neither exiting in the memory cache, nor in the downloaded files folder. So the app checked the codedownloadTaskMapcode if theres already a thread downloading this file, so that it doesnt have to create a new AsyncTask to the same thing. bBUTb how I can know when this pending download task has finished or not without blocking the main thread If I do something like a waitnotify or some infinite whileloop, I was wondering this will block the UI threadp  pPointers are welcome, thank youp

Im assuming that the project root is the folder that contains the gemfile.p  pIm assuming that the gemfile.lock will force my colleagues gems to match mine, even if one of his gems is more up to date than mine.p  pIm assuming that the contents of RMs External Libraries will be recreated on my colleagues RM, without my needing to include these files in the ZIP.p  pI would be grateful for any advice.p

Negative 5876 pI am working on a logic where I have populate a composite class instance from a dictionary KeyValue pairs. The composite classes will be marked with attributes which will be mapped against the keys from the dictionary. One specific requirement is that if class C1 is having a property of type class C2, but there are no pairs in the dictionary for the properties of class C2 to be mapped against then C2 should be set to null. Otherwise if there is at least a single property of C2 which can be mapped, then C2 property of C1 must be instantiated. I have written a recursive function to implement this logic. The requirement is not working as intended. I am using a flag isInstanceValuePresent which check if at least one of the property of C2 can be mapped. Else, its false value should tell me that I have to assign null to the C2 property of class C1. If anyone can help me understand why the logic fails and what could be the correct solution, I would very well appreciate that.

Negative 5876 pThe more I figure out how XText works and what it does the more I like it. Im using it in several areas of my development and have a feature Id like to build where I want to programmatically construct an ecore model based on the generated Xtext model for my DSL and then reverse engineer that model back into DSL code. I suppose I could build a code generator for doing this unique to each DSL but it would be great if XText had a generic feature allowing me to take an in memory model of my DSL and generate the DSL code like it nicely does from code to ecore model. Cant find much online and wondering if anyone might be able to help. Thanks   Duncan Krebsp

Negative 5876 pIm building a page that has a list on the left, and a container showing a single items details on the right. Here is a sample image showing the page layout and the parts I want to scroll.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comVanku.png altenter image description herep  pIn both the left container and the right container, I need to scroll when the data exceeds the containers viewport height. I only want the redhighlighted containers to scrollthe outer blue container is fixed, and the yellow portion inside the blue container is fixed. Only the red containers contents should scroll, only when applicable. p  pIve put up a a hrefhttpcdpn.iovaouE relnofollowcodepena where Im playing around with it and can share it with you the app itself is behind firewall, codepen is the best I can do. What youll see on the codepen is that I can get the container to scroll when I set its height in this case, 380px, which is loosely about how much space is there on screen. If you move the sample codepens container up, youll see the scroll area stays fixed duh, and if you increase the height of the scrollable container beyond 380px, once you go below viewport, scrolling starts to go awayat around 800px or so it completely goes away. p  pWhat the heck am I missing here  The blue containers should size themselves to the bottom of the viewport, whether its 800px high or 1600px high. Then The red containers height would fill that available height inside the blue container, and scroll if necessary. p  pIm really stumped on what Im missing here. p  pstrongEditstrong jQuery and javascript sizing are not options. This is achievable by CSS only, Im just missing some property somewhere and am stumped. p  pstrongEdit 2strong I tried the suggested html html height100, etc. It works in codepen, but when I attempt it on my full version of the site, it doesnt work. In the screenshot here, you can see the blue highlighted area is the scroll container in question, and the white bar on the right is the scrollbar customstyled background but no actual scrolljust the bar background. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comlA3GZ.png altenter image description herep

Negative 5876 pI have an annoying problem since a month ago. Let me introduce the problem. Several weeks ago i got 2 similar projects, and each of them would be implementing push notification. Say the apps name were AB and DC. So i tried to find out some articles about push notification, and i found a hrefhttpwww.raywenderlich.com32960applepushnotificationservicesinios6tutorialpart1 relnofollowhttpwww.raywenderlich.com32960applepushnotificationservicesinios6tutorialpart1a. At the first time i was implementing the Push Notification on the AB project, and it was going well, it was well done at the firsttry. Then i did the same things, I did couple of steps for DC project. And it didnt work DC Project. I had just copied the same code ive used in AB to the DC project, and it didnt work DC Project. The codes were similar. As before I thought that i missed any single code, so i used the AB certificate in DC project, and it worked but the notification was sent for AB project, then i thought the DC code was correctly written. Does anyone of you know what has been going wrong p  pFYI p  pFor AB Project worked  I was using Development Cert p  pSystem and Tools  XCODE 5  For Push Agent I was using C MoonAPNSp  pI think i have the similar problem with this thread a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions18956915stuckcreatingp12fileformoonapnsrq1Stuck creating p12 file for MoonAPNSa but the referred thread hasnt been answered yet. p  pThanks in advance .p

Apple does not allow tracking devices. p  pBut yet, I am in need to implement that kind of functionality in my App. I was wondering if it is possible  I am aware of location tracking, my concern here is live GPS tracking.p  pPlease point me in right direction here, Any help with be truly appreciatedp
Negative 5876 pI just started making my own mapgenerator. I finished the perlin noise yesterday. The problem now is that it gives me a texture with more wholes in it than a swiss cheese... So i planned to make some code to cut out one of the wholes with some kind of automatic algorithm. Later i could blend them together on some background and make many different sized caves and ores and so on. Now i need an algorithm that can cut out one cave and put it on an alpha channel.p  pThe way i would do it now is making my own method wich needs X and Y as parameter. This method would check if the pixel at the Coordinates is black. If it is it puts this pixel down on a 2dTexture and it would call itself with the Coordinates of the pixels that are located next to the pixel it checked. if the pixel is not black it does nothing. I would also have to make sure the pixels will only get checked once.p  pNow do you think this is a clever way of generating my terrain, ores, caves, etcp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comDCZtY.jpg altenter image description herep

Negative 5876 pI started using PyQt4 a while ago and now Im trying to create a small animation using QGraphicsItemAnimation. I never did that with PyQt4 before, I always used pygame. There have to be different layers, qpixmaps can be animated on these layers but these layers can also be drawn onto other layers and then the whole layer can be animated with all qpixmaps draw onto it. I saw somewhere that with QGraphicsItemAnimation I can animate the QGraphicsItems without having to redraw them to the layer theyre on like I have to in pygame. Its a little bit hard to explain. I hope you understand what I mean. Ill add some pictures so its more clear.p  pFor example if I have these two shapesp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.commSd10.png altenter image description herep  pI can for example move only the qgraphicsitem of the rectanglep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comtrIXt.png altenter image description herep  pBut I can also move the whole layer, the ellipse and the rectangle are drawn onto the same layer, so if I move the whole layer after moving the rectangle, itll look like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comKm8Lm.png altenter image description herep  pTo achieve this I somehow have to create these layers and I thought of doing this by using the QGraphicsPixmapItems as layers and then draw other QGraphicsPixmapItems onto them, either as layers or as single pictures. Something like when you add a QGraphicsItem to a QGraphicsScene, but QGraphicsScenes cant be animated with QGraphicsItemAnimation as far as I know. I looked through the documentation but I could only find QGraphicsPixmapItem.setPixmap and that replaces the old pixmap instead of adding another one on top of it. So how can I add a QGraphicsPixmapItem to another QGraphicsPixmapItem Im using Python 2.7.3 if that matters.p

Negative 5876 pHow can I parse sequence of binary digits in python. Following is an example for what i am trying to do.p  pI have a sequence of binary digits, for examplep  precodesequence   1110110100110111011011110101100101100 codepre  pand, I need to parse this and extract the data.p  pSay the above sequence contains istart, id, data and end fieldsp  pstart is a 2 bit field, id is an 8 bit field, data field can vary from 1 to 8192 bits and end is a 4 bit field.ip  pand after parsing Im expecting the output as followsp  precoderesult  start  11,           id  10110100,           data  11011101101111010110010,           end  1100,           codepre  pIm using this in one of my applications. Im able to parse the sequence using regex but, the problem is regex must be written by the user. So as an alternative im using BNF grammar as grammars are more readable.p  pI tried solving this using pythons iparsimoniousi and ipyparsingi parsers. But am not able to find the solution for the fields with variable length.p  pThe grammar i wrote in parsimonious available for python is as followsp  precodegrammar  sequence  start id data end  start  [01]2 id  [01]8 data  [01]1,8192 end  [01]4  codepre  pSince the data field is of variable length, and the parser is greedy, the above sequence is not able to match with the above grammar. The parser takes end field bits into the data field.p  pI just simplified my problem to above example.p  pLet me describe the full problem. There are 3 kinds of packets lets call them Token, Handshake and Data packets. Token and Handshake packets are of a fixed length and Data packet is variable length. The example above shown is an example for data packetp  pThe input consists of a continuous stream of bits. Each packet beginning is marked by the start pattern and packet end is marked by the end pattern. Both of these are fixed bit patterns. p  pExample Token packet grammarp  precodestart  2 bits, id  8 bits, address  7bits, end  4bits 111011010011011101100 codepre  pExample Handshake packet grammarp  precodestart  2 bits, id  8bits, end  4 bits 11101101001100 codepre  pExample top level rulep  precodepacket  tokenpacket  datapacket  handshakepacket codepre  pIf there were only one type of packet then slicing would work. But when we start parsing, we do not know which packet we will finally end up matching. This is why I thought of using a grammar as the problem is very similar to language parsing.p  pCan we make the slicing approach work in this case where we have 3 different packet types to be parsedp  pWhats the best way to solve this problemp  pThanks in advance,p
Negative 5876 pI am not sure if this is the right place for this question. So please let me know before down voting the question. Since the introduction of codeARTAndroid Runtimecode in code4.4 KitKatcode there have been bundles of apps which keep on crashing every single time whenever the virtual machine is selected to codeARTcode. So my question is How do you make a app codeARTcode compliant. Is there some specific code that we need to use, changes in the manifest What are the changes that we developers need to do to make a app run flawlessly on both codeDalvikcode and codeARTcode. I researched a bit online but cannot find anything concrete as of yet. Any sort of help is highly appreciated.p

Negative 5876 pStill fairly new to RoR, let alone Ruby itself. Heres my issue. Im using Rails 4 and Ruby 2.1.0p  pI have a User class with this relationshipp  precodehasmany roles, gt uniq , through gt userroles acceptsnestedattributesfor roles codepre  pNow, the table roles simply has a list of roles, such as admin, moderator, visitor, artist, etc.p  pThe table userroles, is just a relational table, with the roles key and the users key.p  pSo, to clarify, users has a one to many relationship with userroles and userroles table has a many to one relationship with the roles table.p  pSomething like thisp  precodeusers id, name, email ie 12, mikey, mikefoobar.com userroles id, userid, roleid ie 4324, 12, 8 roles id, name, weight ie 8, moderator, 11 codepre  pIve been given the task of adding a checkbox toggle in the admin section so that an admin can grant the moderator role to any one user.p  pEach admin page is for one specific user. Therefore, the formfor is based on the user instance, depending on which user the admin selected for editing.p  pRailsCasts 196 kind of helped me understand the concept, but its platform is just different enough that Im not sure how to exactly translate it into what I need. Likewise, there are some similar questions here on StackOverflow as well  but again, I cant seem to get it to translate correctly into my situation.p  pWhat I do have, I think should be at least somewhere in the realm of the right direction. THen again, maybe Im way off.

But, first things first.p  pUPDATE So, the reason Im getting the undefined error is because it doesnt exist for that user. Which is bad. I need to be able to add the role to the user or remove the role. However, the only roles coming through are the roles the user has already been assigned to. So Im totally doing this wrong. Now Im really in the dark.p

Negative 5876 pHello I am creating a card game and using System.Net and System.Net.Sockets classes.  What I am having a hard time doing is figuring out how I am going to distinguish who did what and who to send that packet of information to.  For example here is the order of things that would be happening.p  p1. User logs into program and Credentials are checked against a MySQL Database.p  p2. The user gets to create a game ID or game  that is also checked against a database to see if there is already a game ID matching and allows them to join the game or if there is no game then inserting data into the database and essentially waiting for another player to join it think server browser if you will for online games.p  p3. Once the user has either joined a game in progress or has created a game it calls a Async BeginConnect.p  p4. The user then plays the game and the data like played card or looses life etc is sent to the only other player in the current game.p  pMy question is how to only send that information to the correct players.  The game will only support 2 players 1 on 1 but there could be multiple games going on at one given time.  For example there could be 5 games playing each supporting 2 players.  What is the best way for me to keep track of these sockets so that I can distinguish between the game IDs.p  precodegt user1 is playing in game with ID 1 against user2 gt user1 plays a card gt Only send this information to user2 codepre  pI appreciate the help in advance and please let me know if I left something out that would be fruitful in answering my question.p  p UPDATE  I have continued to keep looking at examples how others are handling keeping track of individual sockets for each user or in this case Game Room.  Should I create a class for lets say a ClientSocket and assign it propertiesp

Negative 5876 pI would like to create a new Swing JComponent based on an existing one, but with a different API. In other words, I dont want to extend the existing component, because I dont want its API to be accessible.p  pHere an example to clarify my needsp  pA replacement of the codeJCheckBoxcode which show two buttons ONOFF. This could be based on a empreconfiguredem codeJCommandButtonStripcode some info a hrefhttpinsubstantial.github.ioinsubstantialflamingolearn.html relnofollowherea but exposing exactly the same API of codeJCheckBoxcode. The configuration of the codeJCommandButtonStripcode must not be altered.p  pWhat is the best approach for such a problemp  pstrongClarificationsstrongp  pAs someone pointed out, what I wrote about API is not clear.p  pOf course codeJComponentcode have a number of public fields and methods which will be available for each subclass. Then each subclass of codeJComponentcode may add its own public fields and methods. For example, codeAbstractButtoncode adds the codeisSelectedcode method, while codeJCommandButtonStripcode adds the codegetButtonCountcode method.p  pSo, what I meant is I want to create a new codeJComponentcode subclass codeMyJComponentcode, which is based on an existing one codeExistingJComponentcode. I dont want the public methods of codeExistingJComponentcode, except those of codeJComponentcode, to be exposed by my class codeMyJComponentcode. Then I want to add some public methods to codeMyJComponentcode.p  pPlease note that Im not looking for an alternative to the codeJCommandButtonStripcodecodeJCheckBoxcode example. Im interested in a general approach to such a problem.p

Negative 5876 pI have a problem with my media queries.p  pI am targeting to start with a maxdevicewidth of 1024px with one stylesheet, and mindevicewidth of 1025px with another, then using percentages so the content adapts to the browser resizing.p  pHowever, my large 20inc screen uses the same stylesheet as my 11.6inch screen, I assume this is due to resolution as my old computer with a 15inch screen uses the other, smaller stylesheetp  pBecause I am usingpercentages for my main content area, this area appears fine on my large screen as clearly I dont want the content spread over my whoe 20inch screen, but on my small 11.6inch screen it looks tiny.p  pWhat am I doing wrong Is there best practice for targeting devices and is using percentages a viable option I like the way my content adapts to the browser resizing bit by bit.p  pI understand a decent amount about how media wueries work, but would love to have a method that I could use for most sites, be it using devicewidth, width or resolution etc, as at the minute I find I need to keep adding stylesheets.p  pThanks in advancep

might have lots of errors, and I am grateful if anyone points them out, but I am most interested in why my rotating cube is gray and not colorful.p  pI have skipped all error handling to keep source code size low, sorry about thatp  pstrongEDITstrong Found out I missed some UV settings, still gray cube though ...p  precodeinclude ltwindows.hgt include ltSDL.hgt  include ltGLglew.hgt include

Each activity is given a window in which to draw its user interface. The window typically fills the screen, but may be smaller than the screen and float on top of other windows.,             A Service is an application component that can perform longrunning operations in the background and does not provide a user interface. Another application component can start a service and it will continue to run in the background even if the user switches to another application. Additionally, a component can bind to a service to interact with it and even perform interprocess communication IPC. For example, a service might handle network transactions, play music, perform file IO, or interact with a content provider, all from the background.,             Content providers manage access to a structured set of data. They encapsulate the data, and provide mechanisms for defining data security. Content providers are the standard interface that connects data in one process with code running in another process.,             An Intent is a messaging object you can use to request an action from another app component. Although intents facilitate communication between components in several ways, there are three fundamental usecases.

Multiple values of 253 will mean that there will be multiple blocks for that one value. In this case we know Variable C needs 3 bytes.

Negative 5876 pWhen I compile 32bit C code with GCC and the fomitframepointer option, the frame pointer ebp is not used unless my function calls Windows API functions with stdcall and atleast one parameter.p  pFor example, if I only use GetCommandLine from the Windows API, which has no parametersarguments, GCC will omit the frame pointer and use ebp for other things, speeding up the code and not having that useless prologue.p  pBut the moment I call a stdcall Win32 function that accepts at least one argument, GCC completely ignores the fomitframepointer and uses the frame pointer anyway, and the code is worse in inspection as it cant use ebp for general purpose things. Not to mention I find the frame pointer quite pointless. I mean, I want to compile for release and distribution, why should I care about debugging if I want to debug Ill just use a debug build instead after reproducing the bugp  pMy stack most certainly does NOT contain dynamic allocation like alloca. So, the stack has a defined structure yet GCC chooses the dumb method despite my options Is there something Im missing to force it to not use frame pointerp  pMy second grip I have with it is that it refuses to use push instructions for Win32 functions. Every other compiler I tried, they used push instructions to push on the stack, resulting in much better more compact code, not to mention it is the most natural way to push arguments for stdcall. Yet GCC stubbornly uses mov instructions to move in each spot, manually, at offsets relative to esp because it needs to keep the stack pointer completely static. stdcall is made to be easy on the caller, and yet GCC completely misses the point of stdcall since it generates this crappy code when interfacing with it. Whats worse, since the stack pointer is static, it still uses a frame pointer Just whyp  pI tried mpushargs, it doesnt do anything.p  pI also noticed that if I make my stack big enough for it to exceed a page 4096 bytes, GCC will add a prologue with a function that does nothing but bitwise or the stack every 4096 bytes with zero which does nothing. I assume its for touching the stack and automatically commiting memory with page faults if the stack was reserved Unfortunately, it does this even if I set the initial commit of the stack not reserve to high enough to hold my stack, not to mention this shouldnt even be needed in the first place. Redundant code at its best.p  pAre these bugs in GCC Or something Im missing in options Should I use something else Please tell me if Im missing some options.p  pI seriously hope I wont have to make an inline asm macro just to call stdcall functions and use push instructions and this will avoid frame pointer too I guess. That sounds really overkill for something so basic that should be in compilers of today. And yes I use GCC 4.8.1 so not an ancient version.p  pAs extra question, is it possible to force GCC to not save registers on the stack at function prologue I use my own direct entry point with nostartfiles argument, because it is a pure Windows application and it works just fine without standard lib startup. If I use strongattributestrongnoreturn, it will discard the epilogue restoring the registers but it will still push them on the stack at prologue, I dont know if theres a way to force it to not save registers for this entry point function. Either way not a big deal in the least, it would just feel more complete I guess. Thanksp

Negative 5876 pLong story short, I had a 4.3 GB SVN dump file, and because of broken DVD sectors, now I have a 4 GB file and a 300 MB file.p  pcodesvnadmin loadcode has no problem with the first chunk, but Im unable to recover the second one. I cant load it on top of the partially recovered one or in a new one, because there are paths created in the corrupted chunk in the middle that are now lost.p  pIs there any way to force codesvnadmincode to ignore these files, so that at least I can recover whatever files were added in the last 300 MB dumpp

Negative 5876 pI want to filter my column, lets call it AllStudentID from dataset1 with another column from a different datset.p  pDataset1 had many column such as AllStudentID, Class, Time, Location. Dataset2 has other columns but im focused on a similar column called OnCampusID.p  pIve tried looking into using a filter but since the report itself has the columns from Dataset1, i run into an issue where if I select the column in dataset2, it always gives a FirstOnCampusID. And I dont want that.p  pI looked into IIF but again, im using a column from a different datset plus if lets say that they are NOT equal, I dont want to display anything, instead of putting something there. I know that you have to put a result if true and a result if false.  If Im thinking of it in terms of SQL statements, its like having a WHERE clause WHERE AllStudentIDOnCampusID.p  pI tried running a Parameter but I dont want the select part on the top but rather have the report filtered already.p  pAm I missing something I know it has to be simple.p  pMind you, the following example above is just an example i made up, not the real thing.p

Negative 5876 pI am working on an .net application that needs to present to the user data from 3 different platforms and any actions taken are also saved to the respective databases.

Products added to these different sites need to be reviewed in a single application and each product is either approved to rejected by the user .

Negative 5876 pI am confused as to how Androids memory is structured and managed. I want to understand the way memory is divided and shared between applications.p  pFrom what I have understood so far, every application is allocated its own Dalvik heap of memory which has a strict upper limit. This is managed using a concurrent markandsweep garbage collection mechanism.p  p1 My question is, are only heaps used in applications, or does each application have a stack as well I read a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4859424garbagecollectorinandroid23herea that there is a stack as well as a heap for each process and copying GC works on the heap. Where is this stack and what is it used forp  p2 The link also says that CMS is used on the stack, which does not make sense to me, because doesnt going through the stack elements sequentially kill the point of LIFO And wouldnt compaction be required in this casep  p3 Also, when processes share memory ashmem is it implemented as a shared heap or a shared stackp

The things I usually check on these http requests are p  ul lipresence of requests to various and foretold hostsli listring analysis of these requests if foundli ul  pIs there a tool out there where I can do this kind of task or do I have to build one from scratch I know fiddler has plugin support, maybe I can do one suitable for mep  pIf Im going to build the tool from scratch, what languagemethod do you advise to mep  pThank you in advancep

Negative 5876 pI have a small game server Im making that will have dozens of connections sending player data  constantly. While Ive finally accomplished some basics and now have data sendingreceiving, I now face a problem of flooding the server and the client with too much data. Ive tried to throttle it back but even then I am hitting 90100 cpu simply because of receiving and processing the data received running up the CPU.p  pThe method below is a bare version of receiving data from the server. The server sends a List of data to be received by the player, then it goes through that list. Ive thought perhaps instead just using a dictionary with a key based on type rather than for looping but I dont think that will significantly improve it, the problem is that it is processing data nonstop because player positions are constantly being updated, sent to the server, then send to other players.p  pThe code below shows receive for the client, the server receive looks very similar.

Negative 5876 pIm currently developing a little test game and Ive got over 1.000 divs like a map on the screen. I want to implement a possibility to resize all divs at the same time using a jquery animation. Every div has got the class codetilecode.

Is there a possibilty to resize all my divs with a smooth animation and no freezingp
Negative 5876 pSo Im designing a game similar to Galaga or Space Invaders in JavaFX and while the collision does work, just having it run constantly checking makes the game slow down and if you fire more than 23 shots at a time the game freezes and crashes.  So my though was create a timer that counts down and when it reaches 0 it runs the method it is supposed to.p  pSo here is what I have  when I add an enemy in the addEnemy method it calls countdownToSmallCollisionCheck which runs the smallCollisionCounter method the given number of times, the smallCollisionCounter method reduces the counter an int for the milliseconds until it reaches 0, which at that time it calls the smallCollisionTimeline method and resets itself to its original value, the smallCollisionTimeline method contains the animation that controls the collision check and actually checks for collisions.p  pSo the route this takes is  addEnemy  countdownToSmallCollisionCheck  smallCollisionCounter  smallCollisionTimeline  checkCollisionSmallp  pI know I have some sort of logic error in here somewhere as the collisions are never being detected, but I cant seem to figure out what it is.  Also there might be a better way to do this that I havent figured out.  Ive looked through the API and other book and web sources but nothing seems like a direct way to do this where I can just use one function to call the method after X time passes.  Anyway, Im grateful for any and all help with this.

Negative 5876 pI use a RecyclerView to display a list of items with a list layout. I switch from a list layout to a grid layout, showing just a subset of all the data when in grid layout. This switch uses a different layout XML than when list layout is presented.  p  pAll this works well, except that when I scroll, recycled cached list layout views populate the grid, mixed in with proper grid layout view items. In other words, instead of using my codelayoutgrid.xmlcode for each items layout in the RecyclerView, I get items using the codelayoutlist.xmlcode layout, but in a grid format.p  pThis tells me the LayoutManager is working correctly, switching from a list to grid layout. But not all item view items are recreated using the grid xml layout, but rather recycled list layout views are used.p  pI tried codeRecyclerView.removeAllViewscode, codeRecyclerView.removeAllViewInLayoutcode, codeRecyclerView.swapAdaptercode to force adapter reload, all to no avail.p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pIf I scroll two positions down in the list, and then switch from list to grid, the first two positions do not go through onCreateViewHolder, but straight to onBindViewHolder and are therefore not forced to use the grid layout xml. Instead those first two position items are recycled I think and displayed in their list layout format.p

Negative 5876 pI was reading the chapter in a hrefhttpshop.oreilly.comproduct9780596510046.doBeautiful Codea on the Linux kernel and the author discusses how Linux kernel implements inheritance in the C language amongst other topics.  In a nutshell, a base struct is defined and in order to inherit from it the subclass struct places a copy of the base strongat the endstrong of the subclass struct definition.  The author then spends a couple pages explaining a clever and complicated macro to figure out how many bytes to back in order to convert from the base part of the object to the subclass part of the object.p  pstrongMy questionstrong Within the subclass struct, why not declare the base struct as the emfirstem thing in the struct, instead of the emlastem thingp  pThe main advantage of putting the base struct stuff first is when casting from the base to the subclass you wouldnt need to move the pointer at all  essentially, doing the cast just means telling the compiler to let your code use the extra fields that the subclass struct has placed after the stuff that the base defines.p  pJust to clarify my question a little bit let me throw some code outp  precodestruct device   this is the base class struct      int a      int b      etc  struct usbdevice   this is the subclass struct     int usba     int usbb     struct device dev  This is what confuses me                           why put this here, rather than before usba  codepre  pIf one happens to have a pointer to the dev field inside of a usbdevice object then in order to cast it back to that usbdevice object one needs to subtract 8 from that pointer.  But if dev was the first thing in a usbdevice casting the pointer wouldnt need to move the pointer at all.p  pAny help on this would be greatly appreciated.  Even advice on where to find an answer would be appreciated  Im not really sure how to Google for the architectural reason behind a decision like this.  The closest I could find here on StackOverflow is a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions16397192whytousetheseweirdnestingstructurewhy to use these weird nesting structureap  pAnd, just to be clear  I understand that a lot of bright people have worked on the Linux kernel for a long time so clearly theres a good reason for doing it this way, I just cant figure out what it is.p

Negative 5876 pI have been having a very odd problem when trying to use OpenGLs C API. I am trying to load in a texture using ImageMagick, and then display it as a simple 2D textured square. I have a decent amount of experience with using OpenGL in Java, so I understand how to render a texture and bind it to a primitive. However, each time I attempt to draw it, the program either fails to render, or it renders it as a properly sized white square. Im not entirely sure what is going on, but I believe it has to do with ImageMagick.p  pI have been using Ubuntus terminal for compiling, and Ive learned just how painful it can be to have to install libraries manually. ImageMagick first refused to compile when used in my program, and when I finally got the program to compile, it would segfault each time it ran. Ive finally got it working, but now, whenever I attempt to load in the image, the program will run without rendering. I havent found anything like this on Google.p  pa hrefhttpimgur.comC7yKwDK relnofollowhttpimgur.comC7yKwDKap  pThe odd thing is, very rarely, it will work correctly and render the square as expected. However, when I then try to rerun the program, it fails as shown above. Ive determined that the line that causes it to fail to render is the same line the image is loaded, so that led me to believe that the image was just being loaded incorrectly, causing the program to fail. strongHoweverstrong, if I move the texture loading code before the creation of the GL window, the program will consistently render successfully, but the textured square appears only as white though the size of the square is correct, so I know the image loading is working.p  pAnyway, sorry for the long post. Ive just given up solving this one on my own, and was hoping one of you could help me out.p  pstrongOpenGL Initialization Codestrongp  precodeTexture tx void GraphicsOGL  initialize3Dint argc, char argv[]      MagickInitializeMagickargv         glutInitampargc, argv      Loading Here ALWAYS Causes White Square     glEnableGLTEXTURE2D       tx  new TextureResourcesImagestest.png       txgtload      glutInitDisplayModeGLUTDOUBLEGLUTRGBA      glutInitWindowSizeSCREENWIDTH, SCREENHEIGHT     glutInitWindowPosition100, 100     glutCreateWindowOpenGL Game         glViewport0,0,SCREENWIDTH,SCREENHEIGHT     glOrtho0,SCREENWIDTH,SCREENHEIGHT,0, 3,1000      glEnableGLDEPTHTEST     glEnableGLALPHATEST     glEnableGLTEXTURE2D      Loading Here SOMETIMES Works, But Typically Fails     tx  new TextureResourcesImagestest.png     txgtload      glutDisplayFuncdisplayCallback     glClearColor0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f      glutMainLoop  codepre  pstrongTexture Loading Codestrongp  precodebool Textureload      try          mimage.readmfileName        This Line Causes it to Fail to Render         mimage.writeampmblob, RGBA          catch MagickErroramp Error          stdcout ltlt Error loading texture  ltlt mfileName ltlt   ltlt Error.what ltlt stdendl         return false           width  mimage.columns     height  mimage.rows      glGenTextures1, ampmtextureObj     glBindTexturemtextureTarget, mtextureObj     glTexParameteriGLTEXTURE2D, GLTEXTUREBASELEVEL, 0     glTexParameteriGLTEXTURE2D, GLTEXTUREMAXLEVEL, 0     glTexParameterfmtextureTarget, GLTEXTUREMINFILTER, GLLINEAR     glTexParameterfmtextureTarget, GLTEXTUREMAGFILTER, GLLINEAR      glTexParameterfGLTEXTURE2D, GLTEXTUREWRAPS, GLREPEAT     glTexParameterfGLTEXTURE2D, GLTEXTUREWRAPT, GLREPEAT     glTexParameteriGLTEXTURE2D, GLGENERATEMIPMAP, GLTRUE      glTexImage2DmtextureTarget, 0, GLRGBA, width, height, 0, GLRGBA, GLUNSIGNEDBYTE, mblob.data           glBindTexturemtextureTarget, 0      return true  codepre  pstrongTexture Drawing Codestrongp  precodevoid GraphicsOGL  drawTexturefloat x, float y, Texture tex      glEnableGLTEXTURE2D     texgtbind      float depth  0, w, h     w  texgtgetWidth     h  texgtgetHeight      glBeginGLQUADS         glVertex3fx, yh, depth  glTexCoord2f1,0         glVertex3fxw, yh, depth    glTexCoord2f1,1         glVertex3fxw, y, depth  glTexCoord2f0,1         glVertex3fx, y, depth    glTexCoord2f0,0     glEnd  codepre

Negative 5876 h2Preambleh2  pA known library a hrefhttpsgithub.comwinstonjswinstonWinstona has the same issue as many other different libraries that serve the purpose of multitransport logging. When one of the transports is codeconsolecode the reported message in debugger console browser or any environment for Node.js misses very powerful information the place where the initial call was initiated developers file and instead the place of call inside the library is displayed. In this case multiple calls from different filesplaces are all reported as if logged from one same place.p  h2Solutions triedh2  pIve research two approaches. One was trick on browserNode when they infer the place of call to codeconsole.logcode. The only way i found it can be done is via a hrefhttpwww.html5rocks.comentutorialsdevelopertoolssourcemapssource mapsa. This is a technology that allows to map minified js sources to original sources and debug it while looking at the full source. However, this assumes that there is strongonestrong transition from real minified source to original. And in case of substituting source for codeconsole.logcode in potential library codemyloggercode should be dynamic and reflect the multiple places where codemylogger.logcode is called. I havent found a way to do this dynamically since browser loads the map file just once.p  pAnother one was to substitute the call of codeconsole.logcode and inside of custom function call all other transports this can be the same Winston. However, if we do a simple replace like belowp  precodevar originalLog  console.log console.proto.log  functionmessage     message  [new Date.toISOString, message].join      originalLog.callconsole, message here send via other transports     body.innerHTML  body.innerHTML  message  ltbrgt  codepre  pthe place of call to codeoriginalLogcode will always be the same and it will be reported accordingly in console output. So I thought of intercepting the call to codeconsole.logcode but leaving the original native function in place. But I failed to get the parameters of call.p  precodefunction interceptGettingLog     var originalLog  console.log     Object.definePropertiesconsole.proto,          log              get function arguments is always empty here, which is not a big surprise                 originalLog.callconsole, log accessed   JSON.stringifyarguments                 return originalLog                             codepre  h2Question in shorth2  pDoes anybody know a different approach to logging or a way to trick on browserNode.js when calling codeconsole.logcode The goal is to have a multilevel multitransport logger which would allow to switch verbosity and transports in configuration which will be different for development and production, have full power of codeconsole.logcode and at the same time neat syntax, i.e. a single function call at a place where developer needs to log something.

Really, for each net configuration, one may just cut all the connections up to the output layer. This is really possible, for example, by setting all hidden weights to nearzero or setting biases at some insane values in order strongto oversaturate the hidden layer and make the output independent from the inputstrong. After that, we are free to adjust the output layer so that strongit just reproduces the output as is independently from the inputstrong. In batch learning, what happens is that the gradients get averaged and the net reproduces just the mean of the targets. The inputs do not play ANY role.p

Negative 5876 pWe are using Grails 2.5.0 with MongoDB 3.0.3 and are using Memcached to cache domain instances.

In this case, Grails does not invoke the proxy instance to fetch the values from the database.

Negative 5876 pI am building a Web Application that will be installed many times. The application needs to be able to save certain setting itself upon request.p  pI have an installer InnoSetup but I want to very careful about what permissions I give the Web Application.p  ul liI cant use a database. li liA default install always leaves the web.config as readonly.

The server error page is helpful and gives options such as explicitly giving the IUSRMachineName explicit permission but this is a no go for me.p  pSo my final solution is to have the installer create a user configurable folder and then assigning all users ReadWrite access to that folder.  The administrator can always lock it down more if they want.p  pIf anyone has a better option then let me know.p

Negative 5876 pprogram takes as input a balanced binary search tree with n leaf nodes and computes the value of a function gx for each node x. If the cost of computing gx is minno. of leafnodes in leftsubtree of x, no. of leafnodes in rightsubtree of x then the worstcase time complexity of the program isp  pMy solution p  pFor each internal node the maximum cost would be n2. For every leaf node the cost is zero. p  pAnd number of internal nodes for a balanced binary tree are  leaf nodes  1p  pSo the total cost will be p  pn2  n1 p  pOn2p  pAm I right p

Negative 5876 pFrom my android device I goto settings  add account  select google as the mail account I want to add and there is a wizard to set it up. Part of the wizard opens a browser and has me authenticate via a SAML iDP and then is emsupposedem to return me to the wizard flow and let me add the google account.p  pBut after the SAML iDP login I am just left stuck in the browser tab. i.e. there is something wrong with the SAML response that isnt telling android to go back to the wizard, close the browser tab. Is there any way to get debugging info for this from the android device i.e. more than what I have now which is just a browser window but no idea why the SAML flow isnt working.p

Negative 5876 pUsing ExtJS 4.2, I have a grid with several rows. Within one of the columns, I have a numberfield. If I type code123code into the number field, and then click tab, the value is saved and the grid tabs over to the next column. However, if I type code123code into the numberfield and manually select left click the next column, the value code123code is erased and the data is set back to its original state blank. This seems to be default behavior within an EXT grid.p  pHow can I force EXT to not reset this data when manually selecting out of a field I have tried setting the value programmatically  on codeblurcode but that doesnt seem to work.p

Negative 5876 pI am having a little trouble in Matlab regarding property listeners. I have added a listener to the codeXLimcode and codeYLimcode properties of an axis, triggered on codePostSetcodep  precodeh  addlistenermyaxes,XLim,YLim,PostSet,myfunc codepre  pNow I want my program to do something after both properties have changed, or if only one has changed, but in the latter case I must be sure that the other one was not changed.p  pWhen using the zoom tool on the axes, the properties always change both and always in the order codexcode, then codeycode. So in this case I would not have a problem, but sometimes I am setting the codeXLimcode or codeYLimcode properties programmatically and want the same function to trigger. Somehow I must be able to tell if only one of these two properties has triggered the listener or both. p  pIn the current stage, my callback executes twice once for codeXLimcode and once for codeYLimcode. I want it to execute exactly once, and exactly after I know there is no further change to the two properties. Do you have any idea how to do thisp
