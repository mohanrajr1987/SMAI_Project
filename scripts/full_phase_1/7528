Positive 7528 pIn the old version, I had more control over how I would backup my table and data.p  pAfter selecting the database and table, I would click on the Export tab, and at the bottom was a Save as file checkbox.  From there I would get the Microsoft Windows Explorer Save As dialog box and had more control where to save my .sql files.p  pThis latest version of phpmyadmin no longer gives me that option.  I am given the options Quick and Custom.  Choosing Custom gives me the option to Save output to a file, lets me specify a File name template which is set to TABLE and the character set.  It does not give me the option to choose the save location.p  pWhen I click Go, it opens up the output in my editpad light but through the browsers default downloads folder, and it is frustrating to have to either copy and paste the text in a new file or navigate through a series of folders every time.p  pI am using Version 4.2.5, latest stable version 4.5.0.2 and latest version of Google Chrome.p

Positive 7528 pSo Ive got a table with 700,000 rows in it at the moment. This table takes up about 60MB. When using PHPMyAdmin to browse this table, the first few dozen sets of 30 will load just fine, taking lt0.001 seconds to load.

Im using a PHP script that automatically creates the table when a user submits the questionnaire and it uses the input names to name the columns of the table.p  pI figured a good way to keep everything easy for me to follow later on when I review submissions is to use the questions as the name attribute for the HTML inputs so that when I query it everything is right there and I dont have to wonder which answer goes to which question or go back and forth looking at something else. p  pThe problem I ran into is theres a limit to how long the names of SQL columns can be.  Im not sure of exactly how long that is but I ran into an error until I shortened the input names.p  pSo what I need to accomplish is using shorter names for the inputs so theyre not too long for the sql columns, but somehow link it to another table that consists of the actual names so they can be queried later on when I need to go over a submission.  Is there a workaround for thisp

Negative 7528 pIm trying to figure out if theres a reasonably efficient way to perform a lookup in a dictionary or a hash, or a map, or whatever your favorite language calls it where the keys are regular expressions and strings are looked up against the set of keys.  For example in Python syntaxp  precodegtgtgt regexdict   re.compilerfoo.  12, re.compilerFileN.  35  gtgtgt regexdict[food] 12 gtgtgt regexdict[foot in my mouth] 12 gtgtgt regexdict[FileNotFoundException file.x does not exist] 35 codepre  pObviously the above example wont work as written in Python, but thats the sort of thing Id like to be able to do.p  pI can think of a naive way to implement this, in which I iterate over all of the keys in the dictionary and try to match the passed in string against them, but then I lose the O1 lookup time of a hash map and instead have On, where n is the number of keys in my dictionary.  This is potentially a big deal, as I expect this dictionary to grow very large, and I will need to search it over and over again actually Ill need to iterate over it for every line I read in a text file, and the files can be hundreds of megabytes in size.p  pIs there a way to accomplish this, without resorting to On efficiencyp  pAlternatively, if you know of a way to accomplish this sort of a lookup in a database, that would be great, too.p  pAny programming language is fine  Im using Python, but Im more interested in the data structures and algorithms here.p  pSomeone pointed out that more than one match is possible, and thats absolutely correct.  Ideally in this situation Id like to return a list or tuple containing all of the matches.  Id settle for the first match, though.p  pI cant see O1 being possible in that scenario Id settle for anything less than On, though.  Also, the underlying data structure could be anything, but the basic behavior Id like is what Ive written above lookup a string, and return the values that match the regular expression keys.p

Negative 7528 pI have an ASP.Net web page, which uses a Master Page template.p  pThe page has an UpdatePanel with some basic AJAX functionality change the value of a DropDownList and the UpdatePanel will refresh. This is all working nicely.p  pI also have a link that pops up a nyromodal Modal, inside the modal, another ASP.Net web form is loaded.. Because I want this page itself to have its own functionality and not just be a static page etc. Its a Create New dialogue to be precise. So it creates a new record, then when it closes you go back to the main list of records page etc.p  pIm using the following jQuery code to initiate the nyromodal calls.

Its even using the blockeraspnetForm bit which stops nyromodal from going outside of ASP.Nets main postback form named aspnetForm, which is meant to solve an a hrefhttpcode.google.compnyromodalissuesdetailid114 relnofollowalmost identical problema.p  pBUT..p  pThe web page that Im loading into my modal, is ALSO a .Net web form. So it also has its own builtin postback aspnetForm of course. So when the modal appears and I use FireBug to check the DOM structure, I actually have two ASP.Net forms now nested. And because nyromodal is essentially just a div or a few divs, the form tags are essentially nested.p  pSo I think this is screwing things up big time. Its actually crashing IE7 totally fatal exceptions. IE7  FireFox When I close the dialogue, my main web form wont postback any more. I think its been very confused by the 2 form tags that were there a moment ago.p  pIt should be a really simple requirement to be able to open an ASP.Net web form as the contents of your modal using nyromodal. I do blame it on ASP.Net for being so lame and putting a mandatory form tag in every page. If I was using PHP, I wouldnt have experienced ANY of these problems Ive had today, but Im stuck using ASP.Bloat for work purposes.p  pAny thoughts or insight greatly appreciated p

Negative 7528 pHi everyone I have a few questions about the django admin.p  pFirst the relevant details. I currently have Client, Printer, Cartridge, and Order models.p  pThe Printer model has a ManyToManyField to the Cartridge model, which would allow you to select all the cartridges that can be used with that printer.p  pThe Cliente has a ManyToManyField to the printers which they own.p  p1 I want to create an Order through the Django admin which lets your specify the Client, a dicount, and multiple cartridges through a ManyToManyField. This is getting kinda tricky because I have to do it through another table that specifies whether its a new Cartridge or a refill. p  p2 I want the admin to filters the Cartridges to only show the ones that belong to the printers that they own. p  p3 Also I would like to have a field that holds the total price of their order, but it should calculate it based on how many cartridges they have added to the order. I dont know if this should be done by adding more of the same cartridge to the order or by having another field in the related table that specifies the quantity.p  pCan this be done in the admin or do I need to use a form And if so how would I go about adding this to the admin It seems difficult and probably something I will have to do in multiple parts since in order to filter the list of cartridges I have to know the client beforehand.p

Negative 7528 pI have gone through the OWASP top ten vulnerabilities and found that CrossSite Scripting is the one we have to take notes. There was few way recommended solutions. One has stated that Do not use blacklist validation to detect XSS in input or to encode output. Searching for and replacing just a few characters codeltcode and codegtcode and other similar characters or phrases such as codescriptcode is weak and has been attacked successfully. Even an unchecked codeltbgtcode tag is unsafe in some contexts. XSS has a surprising number of variants that make it easy to bypass blacklist validation. Another solution said that Strong output encoding. Ensure that all usersupplied data is appropriately entity encoded either HTML or XML depending on the output mechanism before rendering. So, which is the best way to prevent cross site scripting to validate and replace the input or encoding the output p

Negative 7528 pI have recently encountered some inconsistencies in running unit tests inside VS2008 vs running the same unit tests with mstest on the command line.p  pMy scenario is a bit advanced, so I have probably hit some corners. I have many data driven unit tests running against the same DataSource. I also like experimenting with PostSharp. So, I have written a PostSharp aspect  codeTestDataSourcecode  which I apply to a unit test type, not the unit test methods. When the type is built, this aspect instructs PostSharp to attach the codeDataSourcecode attribute to each and every unit test method in the type.p  pExamining the built assembly in Reflector shows that each test method is indeed attributed with the correct codeDataSourcecode attribute. Running the tests with mstest on the command line behaves as expected  each test is run against the specified data source.p  pHowever, running exactly the same unit tests in VS2008 fails to find the data source. It is as though VS2008 ignores the built assembly and looks at the source code, which, of course, does not appear to be a data driven test, because the codeDataSourcecode attribute is injected during the build.p  pThere is no problem with deployed items. Attaching the codeDataSourcecode manually to the tests makes VS2008 run them happily.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 7528 pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pI have a Windows service that uses various thirdparty DLLs to perform work on PDF files.  These operations can use quite a bit of system resources, and occasionally seem to suffer from memory leaks when errors occur.  The DLLs are managed wrappers around other unmanaged DLLs.p  pstrongCurrent Solutionstrongp  pIm already mitigating this issue in one case by wrapping a call to one of the DLLs in a dedicated console app and calling that app via Process.Start.  If the operation fails and there are memory leaks or unreleased file handles, it doesnt really matter.  The process will end and the OS will recover the handles.p  pId like to apply this same logic to the other places in my app that use these DLLs.  However, Im not terribly excited about adding more console projects to my solution, and writing even more boilerplate code that calls Process.Start and parses the output of the console apps.p  pstrongNew Solutionstrongp  pAn elegant alternative to dedicated console apps and Process.Start seems to be the use of AppDomains, like this  a hrefhttpblogs.geekdojo.netrichardarchive20031210428.aspxhttpblogs.geekdojo.netrichardarchive20031210428.aspxa.p  pIve implemented similar code in my application, but the unit tests have not been promising.  I create a FileStream to a test file in a separate AppDomain, but dont dispose it.  I then attempt to create another FileStream in the main domain, and it fails due to the unreleased file lock.p  pInterestingly, adding an empty DomainUnload event to the worker domain makes the unit test pass.

Negative 7528 pIve got a web application that loads some content from an external source to the dom via an ajax call, one of the things that comes back is a set of images different sizes and aspect ratios to be displayed in an profile photo section. Id like for each of the images to be resized to fit within a 64px x 64px area and Id like to maintain aspect ratio. I was able to do this in firefox, chrome, and safari, but Ive no luck getting this to work in IE 7 or 8. The problem Ive had is finding a jquery event that reliably gets triggered after the image loads since the image was added after the page load. Heres what works in the listed browsersp  precodewindow.loadfunction           .profileThumbnail.eachfunction i              var divHeight  this.height             var divWidth  this.width             if divHeight gt divWidth                  this.cssheight, 64px                 this.csswidth, auto                          else                  this.cssheight, auto                 this.csswidth, 64px                           divHeight  this.height             var divParentHeight  this.parent.parent.height             var divNewHeight  divParentHeight  divHeight  2             this.parent.csstop, divNewHeight             divWidth  this.width             var divParentWidth  this.parent.parent.width             var divNewWidth  divParentWidth  divWidth  2             this.parent.cssleft, divNewWidth               codepre  pIm also trying to center horizontally and vertically them which is what the rest of that code does, but I think Ive got all of that working if I can find a way to trigger this code after the image loads in IE.p  pkeep in mind this needs to work both on the first visit not cached and subsequent visits cached.

Negative 7528 pBack again and have a different question with the same function that I posted beforep  precode AIEnemyUnit  hitTestForEnemyUnitCGPointwhere      CALayer  layer  [self hitTestwhere]      while layer          if [layer isKindOfClass[AIEnemyUnit class]]              return AIEnemyUnit layer          else              layer  layer.superlayer                    return nil  codepre  pI have a bomb that the user drags on top of the enemy so that it is displayed directly above the AIEnemyUnit.  For this bomb I implemented the CALayer codecontainsPointcode to return NO during a drag to allow hitTest to pass through the layer.  Basically this type of hit testing was working fine with these passthrough layers as long as I only used CGImageRef contexts.  However once I started implementing sublayers for additional effects on the bomb,  codehitTestcode immediately broke.  It was obvious, the new layers were capturing the codehitTestcode.  I tried implementing the same technique by overloading codecontainsPointcode for these layers, but it was still returning the bombs generic CALayer subclass instead of passing through.p  pIs there a better wayp
Negative 7528 pI have 4 MSMs that are needed for one of my products and they are all producing ICE32 errors when included.

Negative 7528 pIm working on a GroovyJava calendartype application that allows the user to enter events with a start date and an optional recurrence.

Given a date, I want to figure out whether a recurring event occurs on this date. My logic in pseudocode will be as followsp  precodepublic boolean occursOnDatedef date, def event     def firstDate  event.startDate    if firstDate gt date      return false     else if event.isWeekly      return event.dayOfWeek  date.dayOfWeek     else if event.isMonthly      return event.dayOfMonth  date.dayOfMonth     else       At this point we know the event occurs every X weeks where X gt 1      Increment firstDate by adding X weeks to it as many times as possible, without      going past date     return firstDate  date       codepre  pThis logic seems reasonable, but will actually be quite a lot of effort to implement when you consider all the weird edge cases e.g. how to handle a monthly recurring event in February whose first occurrence is Jan 31.p  pIs there a library that can take help me to implement this Some specifics would be much appreciated e.g. no credit will be awarded for Use Joda Time.p  pThanks, Donp

Negative 7528 pStrings are reference types, but they are immutable. This allows for them to be eminternedem by the compiler everywhere the same string literal appears, the same object may be referenced.p  pDelegates are also immutable reference types. Adding a method to a multicast delegate using the codecode operator constitutes emassignmentem thats not mutability. And, like, strings, there is a literal way to represent a delegate in code, using a lambda expression, e.g.p  precodeFuncltintgt func   gt 5 codepre  pThe righthand side of that statement is an expression whose type is codeFuncltintgtcode but nowhere am I explicitly invoking the codeFuncltintgtcode constructor nor is an implicit conversion happening. So I view this as essentially a emliteralem. Am I mistaken about my definition of literal herep  pRegardless, heres my question. If I have two variables for, say, the codeFuncltintgtcode type, and I assign identical lambda expressions to bothp  precodeFuncltintgt x   gt 5 Funcltintgt y   gt 5 codepre  p...whats preventing the compiler from treating these as the same codeFuncltintgtcode objectp  pI ask because section 6.5.1 of the a hrefhttpwww.microsoft.comdownloadsendetails.aspxfamilyidDFBF523CF98C4804AFBD459E846B268EC 4.0 language specificationa clearly statesp  blockquote   pConversions of semantically identical   anonymous functions with the same   possibly empty set of captured outer   variable instances to the same   delegate types are permitted but not   required to return the same delegate   instance. The term semantically   identical is used here to mean that   execution of the anonymous functions   will, in all cases, produce the same   effects given the same arguments.p blockquote  pThis surprised me when I read it if this behavior is explicitly emallowedem, I would have expected for it to be implemented. But it appears not to be. This has in fact gotten a lot of developers into trouble, esp. when lambda expressions have been used to attach event handlers successfully without being able to remove them. For examplep  precodeclass EventSender      public event EventHandler Event     public void Send              EventHandler handler  this.Event         if handler  null  handlerthis, EventArgs.Empty         class Program      static string message  Hello, world      static void Main              var sender  new EventSender         sender.Event  obj, args gt Console.WriteLinemessage         sender.Send           Unless Im mistaken, this lambda expression is semantically identical          to the one above. However, the handler is not removed, indicating          that a different delegate instance is constructed.         sender.Event  obj, args gt Console.WriteLinemessage           This prints Hello, world again.         sender.Send       codepre  pstrongIs there any reason why this behaviorone delegate instance for semantically identical anonymous methodsis not implementedstrongp

Negative 7528 pIm trying to validate a simple arithmetic expression to insure it fits within the format operand operator operand  234.34  5.  I figured out how to validate this easy enough, but I want the users to be able to continue inputting more than 2 values such as 234.34  5  6  7  34.  So far my regex is as followsp  precode[]d[.d[Ed]][s[]s[]d[.d[Ed]]] codepre  pThis partially works, but the problem I have is it allows for some strange things I dont want such as 4.34.1  34 p  pAny suggestions p
Negative 7528 pIm not QUITE done with a hrefhttplearnyouahaskell.com relnofollowthisa tutorial. Its starting to get more abstract and I feel like I need to start some kind of Haskell project in order to solidify what I already know and see the things Ive yet to learn in action so theyre more concrete and less theoretical. Problem is, I dont know what to work on. Ive looked at HappStack  which looks AWESOME, but it also looks a little advanced. I was going through the 99 haskell problems on haskell.org, but those are boring and I cant show off when Ive completed them. Not that im just looking to show off, I just want something I can sort of use.p
Negative 7528 pI have the following factory class. It has two methods which take Class instances and return the corresponding object. They have the same method name, and both methods take Class as parameter but with different generic class, also return different types. Does the compiler think these two methods as duplicate When I open the java file in Eclipse, it reports errors likep  pDescription Resource    Path    Location    Type Method lookupHomeClass has the same erasure lookupHomeClass as another method in type EJBHomeFactory  EJBHomeFactory.javap  pHowever, it seems the javac wont report any error on it.p  precodeimport javax.ejb.EJBHome import javax.ejb.EJBLocalHome  public class EJBHomeFactory      public ltT extends EJBHomegt T lookupHomeClassltTgt homeClass throws PayrollException          return lookupRemoteHomehomeClass           public ltT extends EJBLocalHomegt T lookupHomeClassltTgt homeClass throws PayrollException          return lookupLocalHomehomeClass            ... define other methods ...   codepre  pUpdate 1 Here is the ant script that makes the code pass, Im not sure how it works, but it doesnt throw any errors.

Negative 7528 pI develop a graphical editor in CQt, that uses a tree of objects as its data model. The objects classes also form a class hierarchy. You can think of a tree of widgets in some kind of GUI framework, like Java Swing or Qt. Now I want to implement an undoredofunctionality. Therefore I need to track every modification to both the tree nodes e.g. changing object properties and also the tree itself e.g. adding, deleting nodes. Unfortunately the tree objects will also be modified by third party code and I have to ensure, that this code does not break my application.p  pSo, considering that the tree will be HUGE several 100,000 nodes how can I ensure, that I can see every modification to the tree It should also be noted, that the tree nodes contain a lot of modifiable properties.p

The problem is that there is no way to define triggers in hbm files and I had to write out the trigger again in Sqlite.  Now, I got through the inserted part of trigger but for the life of me cant figure out the one for update.  Can anyone here who has more experience in sqlite trigger shed some light herep  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 7528 pIm programming genetic processes in java for my project and I want simulate the mitosis of a human cell. A human cell contains 23 pairs of chromosome. Mitosis is basically a cell division, or reproduction, in which a cell gives rise to two genetically identical daughter cells.

Right So I tested and 1 was in fact the fastest.p  pThe best performance was achieved with option 1 and the Prelude [Char] functions.

I mean, interface should be a promise that a class implementing an interface has all interface methods implemented. p  pWhat I dont understand is do we have to check if class implements interface with instanceOf every time we call its methods Without reading documentation you have no idea some class implements interface. And if you read the code than you can see yourself that there is that method defined and you can call itp  pIf I have p  pcase A.p  precodeclass Ball function kick...  codepre  por  case B.p  precodeinterface Kickable function kick   class Ball implements Kickable function kick...  codepre  pthe only difference is that in case A Ill get an error when calling a method that it doesnt exist in runtime and in case B Ill get this error when trying to run the code while trying to compile.

Why do we have to implement an interface Runnable and then define run method in that class I mean, class could have a Run method without implementing an interface and there are means to check if class has a special method defined.

So for each table row selected, the detail view will populate those labels with the information contained within a single dictionary, as the UILabels are linked to the keys in the plist.

Negative 7528 pWe have a book reading application and I have been tasked with implementing basic chat functionality.  We have chosen openfire as the chat server.  My question is, while reading a book, when the user turns the page, this does a complete page refresh.  How can I keep the chat going across those refreshes I dont want to bump a user and make them rejoin.  Any ideas of the path I should take to implement this We would in theory like to drop in a client into the page and it works with minimal effort.  Anyways, are their clients that persist across refreshesp

I know there is Titanium, Phonegap, GWT, Grails, jQuery, SpringMVC and much more. However I am not sure what to pick and if I could to Web AND Mobile with those. Actually I am not sure if it makes sense to look for one particular framework that can do both, but I assume from a learning perspective it might be right. I also know there is Adobe Flex which runs in a Flash Player on the Web and on Mobiles, but I do not want to use Flex because of the Adobe announcement yesterday, I think FlexFlash has not future on mobiles.p  pIdeally the framework should be well documented, robust and have a good community.

For e.g if I load a first page everything is fine and the url of the page is localhostprojectlogin. When, the second page opens, the image source on the second page changes to localhostprojectloginimagessystemlogo.gif. When I refresh the page manually it goes back to normal i.e imagessystemlogo.gif. Why does this happensp  pAnother thing that happens, when I login or logout the name of the controller remains in the URL. However, actually the login and logout functions goes to a certain controller and then redirects the user to the dedicated page. But with jQuery mobile redirection doesnt seem to be working. I tried searching on internet, but couldnt find any help.p  pHope I have explained myself.p

For example the country where they are available where I can order the DVDp  pI get the facet counts for all fields that are contained in the medium documents from this quere, however join queries do not carry any information of the source tables used to filter the join to the result. So I need a second queryp  pI do exactly the same as above, but this time I use swap join and not joined queriesp  pSo my dismax query now becomes a join queryp  pquerysetQueryjoin fromid tomedid typedismax qfqf mm1 q.altememjunglep  pMy joined filter queries become normal filter queriesp  precodequerygtaddFilterQueryprovideramazon querygtaddFilterQueryprice[0 TO 500]  codepre  pAnd my conventional filter query becomes a joined one  this time from the field id to medidp  pqueryaddFilterQueryjoin fromid tomedidreleaseyear[1990 TO 1995] p  pThis now returns all products that match our filters.

Negative 7528 pIm new to git, and I cant make sense of the following behaviorp  pI have a bitbucket repo that I clone locally, then I modify and commit locally, then I push to the remote repo. If I do an implicit push, or push origin, theres no issue. If I push using explicit remote url, I get the status message Your branch is ahead of originmaster by 1 commit.p  pIt seems that git does not recognize the explicit address as being the same as origin, so what exactly is going on. If I do another implicit push, it does nothing, but it does clear the said message.p  pHeres a sample sessionp  precodebazbhostmorecodinggittestsask1 git version git version 1.7.2.5  bazbhostmorecodinggittests git clone httpsshishanibitbucket.orgshishanidirasi.git ask1 Cloning into ask1...

Negative 7528 pI have a file which maintains a buildnumber for release build. Everytime a release build is made, this number is incremented and the file is saved into svn repository. p  pNow say I have a plugin to do this job and i have created a build profile. But I need this plugin to be triggered only when build profile is activated and not otherwise. I guess adding pluginManagement to profile could be the way out like below.

Negative 7528 pI have a templated class called codePooledResourcecode. It handles loading things like textures and sounds for me and ensures that I dont load the same one multiple times on accident. Resources of a certain type will always be in a certain subdirectory, and I wanted to make it easier to load them, so I decided to add a static variable that keeps track of the root folder for a certain type of resource. p  precodetemplate lttypename Tgt class PooledResource  public      ...      static const char PathPrefix     static ResourceTable myResourceTable       static void loadconst char filename               Any attempt to use PathPrefix in here causes a compilation error          All I want to do is use PathPrefix and filename to get the full          path do a file and load it.         template lttypename Tgt const char PooledResourceltTgtPathPrefix  NULL  template lttypename Tgt typename PooledResourceltTgtResourceTable PooledResourceltTgtmyResourceTable codepre  pThe idea is that I can use a typedefd version of this for various types. For example, in codePooledTexture.hppcode I would havep  precodetypedef PooledResourceltTexturegt PooledTexture codepre  pand in codePooledTexture.cppcode I would havep  precodetemplate ltgt const char PooledTexturePathPrefix  ..assetstextures codepre  pThis will all compile and run fine if I dont attempt to use PathPrefix in the load function above. As soon as I use it though, I get errors like thisp  precode 90  CMakeFilesgame.dirPooledTexture.cpp.o.data0x0 multiple definition of agPooledResourceltsfTexturegtPathPrefix  91 CMakeFilesgame.dirluaLuaFrame.cpp.ousrincludec4.6i686linuxgnu.bitsgthrdefault.h241 first defined here codepre  pIve tried reproducing this with a simpler case to try to hunt down the problem, but other cases I try seem to work. Im not sure what Im doing differently here that would cause this error. p
Negative 7528 pThanks to some of the advice I have got previously on Stack Overflow I have been making good progress in my understanding of MVVM. However, it is when things start to get more complicated that I am still struggling.p  pI have the view below which is for the purpose of entering orders.

That item then want to show on the other controller.p  pMy problem is i dont know how to pass the retrieved item to my custom UITableViewController, or which is the best way to achieve this.p  pThis is the interface able to capture a bar code and connect to a web servicep  precodeimport ltUIKitUIKit.hgt import MBProgressHUD.h import ListaItemsViewController.h   interface ViewController  UIViewController lt ZBarReaderDelegate,NSXMLParserDelegate gt      IBOutlet UILabel                   resultText     ListaItemsViewController           listaItemsViewController      MBProgressHUD                      HUD     NSMutableData                      xmlData    neccesary to parse the possible error    NSMutableString                    faultString    BOOL                                esperandoFaultString    neccesary to parse message from logIn and logOut methods webservice    BOOL                                esperandoReturn    NSMutableString                    returnString    neccesary to parse and save an item   BOOL                                esperandoItem   BOOL                                esperandoDescripcionItem   BOOL                                esperandoPrecioItem   BOOL                                esperandoNumTotalItem   NSMutableString                    descripcionItem   NSMutableString                    precioItem   NSMutableString                    numeroTotalItem    NSXMLParser                        parser    property nonatomic,strong MBProgressHUD             HUD property nonatomic, retain IBOutlet UILabel       resultText propertynonatomic,strong NSMutableData            xmlData propertynonatomic,strong NSMutableString          faultString propertynonatomic,strong NSMutableString          returnString propertynonatomic,strong NSMutableString          descripcionItem propertynonatomic,strong NSMutableString          precioItem propertynonatomic,strong NSMutableString          numeroTotalItem propertynonatomic,strong NSXMLParser              parser propertynonatomic,strong ListaItemsViewController           listaItemsViewController  IBAction scanButtonTapped   IBActionesconderTecladoidsender  IBActionmostrarTecladoidsender  end codepre  pand this is the interface p  precode import ltUIKitUIKit.hgt   interface ListaItemsViewController  UITableViewController          the item list       NSMutableArray  listaItems     propertynonatomic,strong NSMutableArray  listaItems  end codepre  pthis is the implementation filep  precode  import ListaItemsViewController.h   import CaracteristicasItemViewController.h    implementation ListaItemsViewController    synthesize listaItems     idinitWithStyleUITableViewStylestyle         NSLogListaItemsViewController. initWithStyle...      self  [super initWithStylestyle]      if self           Custom initialization            return self        voiddidReceiveMemoryWarning          Releases the view if it doesnt have a superview.

Negative 7528 pMy application will be optionally sending social media updates when an action is performed. p  pI want to do this by using the users installed social media apps.

I need to be able to take advantage of the FIRST and FOLLOW sets so I can handle errors in the syntax of the source program more efficiently.

Negative 7528 pThis is kind of an odd question, but ill try to explain it as possible. I have this PHP script which fetches data from MySQL. It gets the userID, Username, Email for each user and puts it in an array p  precodephpoutput  Array  [id] gt 2 [name] gt John [lastname] gt sena  Array  [id] gt 3 [name] gt human [lastname] gt man  codepre  pand so on for as many records as there are. The problem is that i want to send this data to jQuery in order to manipulate it with jquery. I know how to send and get data with jQuery, but how can i deal with multiple arraysp  pNote  I have already used codejsonencodecode to encode the arrays.p
Negative 7528 pIm trying to implement a color scheme I got from Kuler by using the hex RGB values, and Im getting some interesting measurements, depending on the monitor Im using and its calibration.p  pIn Firefox, the color always measures correctly  codee9e8e1code Im using Pixelstick for the Mac to eyedrop the color in the app.p  pIn Chrome and Safari, the color measures off by a hair codee9e8e0code and sometimes codee9e8dfcode, but to me, its quite noticeable that theres a color difference.p  pThe bizarre thing is that eyedropping the color in the Kuler app in SafariChrome is always correct no matter what screen it is on. p  pI suspect that has something to do with Kulers Flash app overriding the color management calibrations for the monitor.p  pIs there a way to force the browser to ignore the color calibration via HTML or CSS code for Safari so that the color specified in the CSS is renderedp  pI thought of using a tiled PNG but Im getting similar measurement variations when I manually select a color in Pixelmator my graphics editing tool even though Im entering the color values manually.p
Negative 7528 pMy problem is the use of constcastlt. I have a class which inherits from vector. Now in one of its member functions when I use codethisgtbegincode, codethiscode being a const  pointer, it returns a constant iterator but I want to obtain a nonconst iterator. The code looks something like ...p  precodeclass xyz  private stdvectorltsomethinggt  public  xyz  void doSomething   void doSomething      xyziterator it     it  thisgtbegin     it.insertsomething here is the problem and this where I need to use constcast                              and in a lot more places  codepre  pIn the above function, since codethisgtbegincode returns a const iterator, I am forced to use a constant iterator and do a typecasting whenever I need to insert an element.p  pI thought of using constcast at thisbegin but my friend told me that it is a bad idea to remove the constness of the codethiscode pointer. If it is so, then what is the way aroundp

My problem is  How can I include the B related instances p  pI cant do something like this p  precodeDim res  From a In dbContext.A.IncludeBrelobj           Select a codepre  pBecause Brelobj is only defined for A1, and not in A nor A2.p  pMy solution is p  precodeDim res  From a In dbContext.A Dim res1  From a1 In res            Where TypeOfa1 Is A1            Select a1  For Each a1 As A1 In res1   dbContext.Entrya1.ReferenceFunctiona a.Brelobj.Load Next codepre  pThat works, but I dont like to loop over the results to Load. Isnt there a way to load all the collection in one time p

Negative 7528 pI read a couple of questions on the topic and the general feedback I see is that codeJPGcodes are for photos and codePNGcodes are for everything elsep  blockquote   pPNG should be used whenp      ul   liYou need transparency either 1bit or alpha transparency li   liLossless compression will work well such as for a chart or logo, or computer generated image li   ul      pJPEG should be used whenp      ul   liLossless compression will not work well such as a photograph li   liFull color is needed li   ul      pGIF should be whenp      ul   liPNG is not available, such as on very old software or browsersli   liAnimation is necessaryli   ul blockquote  pHowever, it seems like these discussions are more geared towards image download. My question is more geared toward image rendering.

So the browser will be able to pull in this image pretty quickly since its relatively small, despite the 40K difference. But does this difference matter when the browser renders the image on the page, especially since its a repeating backgroundp
Negative 7528 pI am after two things. I first want to typedef the codevectorcode class to something a little more meaningful such as codeListcode. I tried the following but it gave me a compile errorp  precodetemplate lttypename Tgt typedef vectorltTgt ListltTgt codepre  pSecondly I want to override the codeltltcode operator of the codevectorcode class, but I have no idea how I would go about it without creating a new class.p  pThis may seem counterproductive but my end aim is to have something that nonprogrammers or people that havent done c before can read that makes semantic sense.p

Negative 7528 pWhenever I load a shared library .so into Python with ctypes and call one of its procedures that uses the OpenCV filter engine like cvErode or cvDilate, the interpreter segfaults deep inside the OpenCV code. If I load the same library with dlopen inside a C program and call the same procedure everything works fine.p  pIve read in another post that it might have to do with the ABI that gcc utilizes and that python has to be compiled with the same version of gcc that the python interpreter was compiled with for this to work.

My database table goes like this, the fist selection called ClothingType  has 3 columns, ID Garment and Price, the second table has 4 columns, ID, ClothingTypeID, QtyValues and price. Basically I am trying to do is make a pricing guide so if i select a tshirt in the first selection box it will bring up 4 prices at the end of the form, 1 for each item, 2 for a total amount If selecting a higher quantity 3 for VAT and 4 Total Amount. Every time selection is selected then it will automatically update the price.

Negative 7528 pIm developing an iPhone app for iOS 5.1. I built a UIViewController which has a UITableView with a UISearchDisplayController and other views, all somehow related to the table. The UIVIewController is the delegate and the datasource of the table, and makes some customizations graphical and businessrelated to the table and search display controller. So far, everything was OK.p  pThe problem is that now I want to put this same table maybe with a different sublist of elements, of the same type in different controllers different screens of the app. I tried to add the tableView of my controller as a subview in other controllers, but it doesnt work. I tried to rebuild my table as a subclass of UIView instead of UIViewController and add it as a subview, but it neither worked it loaded the view from a NIB file, but all its properties, including the IBOutlets, where nil or 0x000000.p  pAfter searching a lot, I didnt find any example of how to reuse a tableview in different controllers. Any hint Any example Should I build it as a UIViewController or as a UIView Which class should be the delegate of the table and searchdisplay, keeping in mind that most of the logic I want to reuse is the code in the delegatesp  pThank you all in advancep

Negative 7528 pIm working rearchitecting a reportingdata warehouse type database.  We currently have a table that has data at the hotel grain i.e. HotelID plus lots of measures, including measures like Last7DaysGross, Last28DaysXXX, etc.p  pIm thinking that it would be best to move to a fact table that is at the HotelStayDate grain.  However, grouping on the HotelID and including date related measures such as Last7DaysGross need to perform very well.p  pWhat kind of structures would work here  I dont think Id be able to use indexed views the way that I had hoped, because of the multiple restrictions on them no subqueries, etc.  To have reasonable performance, will I need to create a new table at the Hotel level aggregated from the HotelStayDate level  Thats the level at which people will most often be querying.  Do I need to actually create fields such as Last7DaysGross  That doesnt seem like a good design, but Im having a hard time coming up with another one.p  pSorry this question is a little vague.  Is there something else Im missing here  I know most often these kind date related measures would be done at the frontend level i.e. in a tool such as Business Objects.

I havent figured out how to make the conductor, well, conduct what screens are displayed beyond the initial screen. p  pIm looking for a place to hook into CMs conductor that will detect when a screen is dismissed. Once a screen is dismissed I can call out to a statemachine like class that decides what Screen should be displayed next. This way each screen is unaware of the other screens in the application.p  pie Startup with a login screen, user logs in, conductor gets a screen deactivated notification and then asks a component what screen it should display next. p

Negative 7528 pIm currently implementing functionality in Tridion 2009 SP1 where the user is able to utilise a filter which in turn queries the broker for matching criteria and then returns the Component Presentations to the page.

Negative 7528 pIm writing a bash script that uses the sudo command on LINUX to automate the process of mounting and extracting media from iso.  As one of the requirements, the script should not require a user to enter their password.  Consequently, Ive edited the sudoers file so that the specified user has no password access priviledges to the mount and umount commands on LINUX.p  pHowever, I was wondering if there was a way for my bash script to detect whether the user has no password sudo priviledges for the mount and umount commands so that it can exit gracefully in the event that the sudoers file has not been configured.p  pIve thought about using sudo l to look at the users sudo priviledges however, this command requires a password.  Furthermore, sudo n true does not appear to be working either. As a result, I was wondering if another method for checking the users sudo priviledges exists without having to parse the sudoers file.p

My question is when a script is not doing what you want where do you start I mean no error messages are outputted as far as I can tell. A debugger almost seems over kill since I dont even know which line the error occurs on. If the only way to find the source of an error is with a debugger than could you please provide a guide on how to use it. Ive actually never used a debugger before in any language. Right now Ive got Venkman debugger and Im not sure how to work itif it does work.p
Negative 7528 pI am developing a game using cocos2D and I am shifting from my home view which is a viewController class to gameScene.

Negative 7528 pI have a chunk of code that tests if a directory exists, deletes it if it exists, and creates a new directory over it.

But if the directory does exist, the codermdircode loop does its job, but PHP throws an errorp  precodePHP Error[2] mkdir Permission Denied codepre  pThe commented codevardumpcode line shows me that PHP still thinks codedirectorycode is a directory even after the codermdircode call. So I use codeclearstatcachecode to update it, but it still wont detect that the directory has been deleted. And when I look it up in the file system, the directory has in fact been deleted.p  pIf I run the script again while the directory is gone, it works just fine.p  pCan anyone figure out how to resolve this error If it makes a difference, I am running this as a PHP command line script on my Win7XAMPP dev environment.p  peditp  pThanks to Wee Kiat and Phillip for the answer. The solution was to use codeunsetfilescode before codermdircode to close the recursive iterator, which was still keeping codedirectorycode open and causing codemkdircode to choke. See their code below.p

Negative 7528 pMy question concerns keychains in iOS iPhone, iPad, .... I think but am not sure that the implementation of keychains under Mac OS X raises the same question with the same answer.p  hr  piOS provides five types classes of keychain items. You must chose one of those five values for the key codekSecClasscode to determine the typep  precodekSecClassGenericPassword  used to store a generic password kSecClassInternetPassword used to store an internet password kSecClassCertificate      used to store a certificate kSecClassKey              used to store a kryptographic key kSecClassIdentity         used to store an identity certificate  private key codepre  pAfter long time of reading apples documentation, blogs and forumentries, I found out that a keychain item of type codekSecClassGenericPasswordcode gets its uniqueness from the attributes codekSecAttrAccessGroupcode, codekSecAttrAccountcode and codekSecAttrServicecode.p  pIf those three attributes in request 1 are the same as in request 2, then you receive the same generic password keychain item, regardless of any other attributes. If one or two or all of this attributes changes its value, then you get different items.p  pBut codekSecAttrServicecode is only available for items of Type kSecClassGenericPassword, so it cant be part of the unique key of an item of any other type, and there seems to be no documentation that points out clearly which attributes uniquely determine a keychain item.p  pThe sample code in the class KeychainItemWrapper of GenericKeychain uses the attribute codekSecAttrGenericcode to make an item unique, but this is a bug. The two entries in this example only are stored as two distinct entries, because their codekSecAttrAccessGroupcode is different one has the access group set, the other lets it free. If you try to add a 2nd password without an access group, using Apples keychainItemWrapper, you will fail.p  pstrongSo, please, answer my questionsstrong  p  ul liIs it true, that the combination of codekSecAttrAccessGroupcode, codekSecAttrAccountcode and codekSecAttrServicecode is the unique key of a keychain item whose kSecClass is codekSecClassGenericPasswordcode  li liWhich attributes makes a keychain item unique if its kSecClass is not codekSecClassGenericPasswordcodeli ul

Negative 7528 pI see a lot of stuff here about the android stack, but I just cant get things to work the way I want them to. In the following diagram Ive numbered each of the transitions.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comSvGfQ.png altapp navigation flowcharp  pTransition 8 was easy. I just start the level difficulty choose activity using Intent.FLAGACTIVITYNOHISTORY. Then, hitting back will just skip over it and go back to the level choose activity.p  pTransition 4 caused a problem because hitting back in the game after restarting ended up in the previous instance of the same game. I was calling finish, so I dont know why it often stuck around, but using Intent.FLAGACTIVITYNOHISTORY when starting the game activity solves this issue. However, this causes problems because transitions 6 and 7 dont work. Starting the app from the task manager or from the icon will always start at the main menu.p  pThe biggest problem is transition 5. Hitting home leaves the app. Theres no way to trap it so I can pop up a dialog to ask the user if they really wish to exit. So, that means I need to get transitions 6 and 7 to come back to the game activity. I dont know how to do that.p  pWhat I need to know is which flags to add to the various intents so that transition 4 doesnt keep multiple instances of game activity running while transitions 6 and 7 end up coming back to the game activity assuming thats where they pressed the home button.p

Negative 7528 pI think this is a very trivial question but I am not able to get a definite answer to it on the net.p  pI have a class which contains both value types and reference types. Considering the reference types in the class will get instantiated sometime during the execution, how the memory is allocated for each member of such a class How the pointer is stored and accessed for each of these members Also which type is created in which memory structure, i.e. stack or heap p  pI know this much that if only a variable of value type is used in my code then its value and all the other details like its type, etc are stored in the stack. Similarly if a reference type is instantiated then the actual object is created in the heap and a pointer to this memory location is stored in the stack. But what about value types present inside a class reference type Where are they stored and how are they accessedp  pI have given an example of such a class below.

Negative 7528 pI would like to create a web portal that provides a user basic functionality, user authorization, statistics, etc. But on a lower level provide applications of various functionality. p  pThrough research and lots of Google I think the best way to do this is making a web page project for the web portal and for easy source control, low coupling, and maintainability require all underneath applications to be a deployable dependency of the web portal. Thus they all auto compile and upload at time of publishing the website This seems great BUT I cannot for the life of me figure out how to call the underlying webpages from under the .dll deployable assembly. p  pIs this even possible It seems it would be from what I can gather since you can compile a whole website aspx and all to a .dll. So how does one go about calling the web pagesapplications in the .dllp  pFor example Id hope to do something like this www.webpage.comDefault.aspx root and web portal www.webpage.combinapplication.dllDefault.aspx the precompiled web application without routingp  pThanksp  pEDIT I want to clarify that the idea is that one development group can maintain the web portal and others can build separate independent applications that will function underneath the portal. Separate projects to be included at compile time is a must. Perhaps this functionality is not possible The purpose of the older style web site project is because this project had been started sometime ago and is a resource for the project. If the project type introduces limitations it would be feasible to change it to a newer project type ASP web application if and only if it achieves my hopes as described above.p  pI was thinking it is a bit hacking but I could add a controller to the .dll that just provides the utility to return a whole aspx or ascx web ui component on demand to be sent to the client. There must be a better way thoughp

Unfortunately there seems to be no way to tell Excel I want the paths to the text files to be relative, not absolute.

Negative 7528 pI have an app where I am trying to switch from jQuery .animate to CSS3 transitions to move a list of cards leftright in response to swipe gestures and button presses.p  pIt works great right now, except for one thing.  I want the app to move one page of cards at a time per swipe, and the only way Ive been able to preserve this has been by preventing swipes while an animation is being performed.  Otherwise, the pages suddenly get out of alignment.p  pThats fine for gesture swipes, but if a user is clicking a button or turning a rotary knob to navigate pages, it should move one page per click.  If its clicked during an animation, I want the animation to skip to the end and start a new animation.p  pUsing jQuery it was easy to clear the animation queue and skip to the end of an animation.  This is exactly what I want, but with CSS3.  But, so far I havent been able to figure out how to do that.p  pBelow is an attempt I made to stop a CSS3 transition, but it doesnt seem to work click the square once to slide, click midslide to remove CSS3 transition properties.

Negative 7528 pI know this may not be an appropriate question, but I want to know how a touch enabled OS like android detects a button in an app and calls the appropriate handler When programming an app we just give the alignment information of a particular button. So, how android keeps the mapping between a button and screen position I think this is kindof dynamic because if you change the screen orientation or use zoom or something like that the button positions are changed dynamically. So, android must look at the touch position and decide whether a button is there or not and call the appropriate handler. How this all things put togetherp  pI appreciate any reply.p

Negative 7528 pService composition is a fundamental part of SOA. All of the capabilities offered by a service inventory are expected to utilize other services within that inventory, where necessary, in order to build the task that they are accomplishing from smaller component parts. This is all from an architectural level, though how does this composition happen at the implementation levelp  pConsider this situation. I have a task service which involves posting a codeprocessrequestcode resource that will manage additional resources involved in asynchronously processing a large file to generate the real resource.  Lets call the eventual real resource a PartsInventory.  So, you provide a URL and a name for the PartsInventory to the codeprocessrequestcode service, which then creates a PartsInventory placeholder and kicks off the asynchronous ETL involved in converting the massive csv file at your URL into a real PartsInventory.  If this asynchronous job fails, it will remove the placeholder and queries to the codeprocessrequestcode service will reflect the failure.  If it succeeds, it will remove the placeholder status and queries to the codeprocessrequestcode service will instead redirect you to the PartsInventory resource.p  pNow, how does the implementation of the interaction between codeprocessrequestcode and the PartsInventory emlookem, from a code standpoint  Am I POSTing requests to a published codepartsinventorycode service, or am I calling ORM objects to create the placeholder  If the former, I am abiding by the published contract and am behaving as a consumer of my own services, which seems to fit the composability principlebut it feels really awkward to interact this way from within the same codebase. On the other hand, the latter presumes that the codeprocessrequestcode handler is going to know about how to create a PartsInventory placeholder on its own, which feels awkward in itself. The third option would be to create a specialized static factory method on the PartsInventory object, called something along the lines of codePartsInventory.createplaceholdercode, so that the codeprocessrequestcode code is at least ignorant of the constructor dependencies of a PartsInventory object. This does still separate creation into two locations, though.p  pHave you encountered this Is there a canonical right answer to this questionp

Negative 7528 pHow would I set up MQ so that every message received is immediately written to file system  I have the redbooks, but at least need someone at least point me to a chapter or heading in the book to figure it out. p  pWe are a .NET shop.  I have written C via API to read the queue, and we currently use BizTalk MQ adapter.  Our ultimate goal is to write same message to multiple directories in file system to clone the feed for our various test environments DEV, STAGE, TRAINING, etc...  The problem with BizTalk is that when we consume the message, we map it at the same time to a new message, so the message is already changed, and we want the original raw message to be cloned, not the morphed one. Our vendors dont offer multiple copies of the feed, for example, they offer DEV and PROD, but we have 4 systems internally. p  pI suppose I could do a C Windows Service to do it, but I would rather use builtin features of MQ if possible. p

I have tried this in various way to solve, but could not find out the exact way.  i tried something like this  p  precodewith open readxcsv, rb as f     reader  csv.readerf     for row in reader              list1  row[13]              queue1.appendlist1             list2  row[14]              queue2.appendlist2             list3  row[15]              queue3.appendlist3             list4  row[16]              queue4.appendlist4 codepre  pand then p  precode rb  openworkbookExact file path.....  wb  copyrb  ws  wb.getsheet0    rowno  0   for item in queue1     ifitem               ii  intitem             ws.writerowno,12,ii              rowno  rowno  1             ws.writeitem             print item     else              ws.writerowno,12,item              rowno  rowno  1    wb.saveOutput.xls  codepre  pbut problem with this solution is it does not allow me to save as .XLSX format which is strictly required for me.p  pI have tried to use Openpyxl as it can handle .XLSX format, but could not find out a way to modify the existing excel file. can anyone please help on thisp  pDoubt     1 Can we really read a whole column from a CSV file and store into an arraylist      using  python   2 Can we modify the existing excel file which is in .XLSX format using       openpyxl or any other package  p

Negative 7528 pIm currently trying to improve the testing behaviour of our application.p  pThe tests are currently started within nested transactions, where the test suite start the actual transaction and the test cases each create nested savepoints.p  pWhen a test case is finished the savepoint is simply released and the original data is restored. When the suite is finished the transaction is rolled back.p  pUsing truncation on the tables is not an option for us, since the seed data is just to big and it prevents central and concurrent testsp  pThis works fine.p  pWhen the transaction run concurrently, the transactions tend to lock each other out of tables.

Essentially that code never should appear in your app. p  pIn all of my iOS apps Ive written thus far, I always declare my variables using codepropertycode in my header file and codesynthesize VARIABLENAME  VARIABLENAMEcode Since watching the lecture, Im now confused as to if I should be using codesynthesizecode in my code at all. p  pShould I just use the property declaration What difference does it make, if any, if I use the synthesize declaration in my codep  pSince Mr. Haggerty doesnt use it, then why do I considering hes sort of an iOS demigod.

Negative 7528 pIm trying to refresh some plots that I have within a gui everytime I go once through a fitting procedure. Also, these plots are within a framw which can be resized, so the axes and labels etc need to be redrawn after the resizing. So was wondering if anyone knew how to update the sides of a figure using something like codeplot.figure.canvas.copyfrombboxcode and codeblitcode.  This appears to only copy and blit the background of the graphing area where the lines are being drawn and not to the sides of the graph or figure where the labels and ticks are.  I have been trying to get my graphs to update by trial and error and reading mpl documentation, but so far my code has jst become horrendously complex with things like codeself.thisplot.canvasofplot..etc.etc.. .plot.figure.canvas.copyfrombboxcode...  which is probably far too convoluted. I know that my language might be a little off but Ive been trying to read through the matplotlb documentation and the differences between Figure, canvas, graph, plot, figure.Figure, etc. are starting to evade me.  So my first and foremost question would bep  pstrong1  How do you update the ticks and labels around a matplotlib plot.strongp  pand secondly, since I would like to have a better grasp on what the answer to this question, p  pstrong2  What is the difference between a plot, figure, canvas, etc. in regards to the area which they cover in the GUI.strongp  pThank you very much for the help.p

Negative 7528 pI have around 20 apps with a picture on the screen and a microphone and speaker at the top of the screen so people can record their voice and play it back. All of these work fine on devices and the simulators. p  pIm finishing up a new app that uses text instead of pictures and I put either a UIWebView with scrolling enabled or a UIScrollView on the screen. Both screens display with the UIButtons for the microphone and speaker on the screen when I run it in the simulator in 6.1. Neither recording button appears in other versions of the simulator or on devices running iOS 5.1.1 or iOS 6.1.2. p  pI just updated all of the apps last week and they run fine on the simulator and on devices and Ive had no feedback from users that the recording buttons are missing. The only difference I can think of for this app is that it uses a ScrollView. If I look at what views are supposed to be on the screen,  NSLog, self.view.subviews  the microphone and speaker have been placed there, they just arent visible. Theyre the opaque buttons on top of the hidden buttons.

It just fails when I try to push it.p  pThen I have tried to upload files to the server manually, create a repo there and clone it locally, but when I do changes locally, commit it and would upload them, it also fails.p  pI really did a few things more, trying to figure it out by myself what is failing.

Negative 7528 pI wonder, how is C polymorphicp  pIf we base on the definition of the word strongpolymorphismstrong  em...polymorphism in the context of objectoriented programming, is the ability to create a variable, a function, or an object that has more than one form...em , of course I can provide more determinations of the polymorphism, but I think on the average with different words all of us understanding what is the polymorphism in Computer Science.p  pSo, about my question, which I relate to C.p  pFor e.g., Im using the very plain and simple example, here is a standard virtual method in one class codeAcode and the overriding method in other class codeBcodep  precodeusing System   class A      public virtual void CallMestring incString              Console.WriteLineincString        class B  A      public override void CallMestring incString              incString  new         Console.WriteLineincString        class App      static void Main              B objectB  new B         objectB.CallMehello       codepre  pFirst of all, I was upset Why does C now allow to use overriding of the both return type and the arguments of a methodp  pFor e.g., just to setp  precodepublic override int CallMestring incString codepre  pBut you wont get the fine result, youll catch an compiler exceptionp  pre classlangnone prettyprintoverridecodeB.CallMestring return type must be void to match overridden member codepre  pFor the situation that Ive described, we can only solve it in C by hiding a method with using a keyword codenewcode if I want to define a method with a similar name, but different return typelist of arguments. I want to admit, that if we hide it, its not a polymorphism at all,  it just a hiding process. Polymorphism in its definition requires to override the existed stuff the similar process could be found in other scientific sciences like chemistry, maths etc...p  pFor e.g. maths allow to use the polymorphism of the 2nd, 3rd... Narny order where the existed set or object could be always redefined. But what for the Computer Science and C exactlyp  pIve read, but not try, that some functional programming languages LISP, Haskell do allow such features.p  pIs it possible see in C in future, because as I see C with each new version is increasing its functional stuff, more and more and maybe it will be possible with lambdasdelegatesp  pWhat do you think about itp

Negative 7528 pI have implemented a custom scroll view not list view. Its using Intent Service to hit the server with offset and limit and display the result. For instance. i set offset  0 and limit  FIRSTBATCH int FIRSTBATCH  15 for the first call. Its returning 15 names and details. And the next intent service call. I am using offset  FIRSTBATCH and limit  FIRSTBATCH. Its retuning next 15 names, from 15 to 30. And i am displaying Load More button at the end of 30 names. Here is my problem.

I am loading the LoadMore Button. And once i click the LoadMore button i am calling the intent service again. But i know this is wrong. As the offset will be always 30 everytime. So the name will be displayed from 30 to 45 all the time. I want this to grow. Say, after i click LoadMore button. I want this to be 30 to 45 and Again hit the load More button, it should be 45 to 60 and goes on ... p  precode    final Button btnAddMore  Button myNameSearch.findViewByIdR.id.loadMore     btnAddMore.setVisibilityView.VISIBLE     loadMoreButton  false     btnAddMore.setOnClickListenernew OnClickListener          Override         public void onClickView v              loadMoreButton               codepre  pAnd here is the loadMoreSpinner methodp  precodeprivate void loadMoreButton      Intent getNameSearch  new IntentgetSherlockActivity, IntentService.class     int finalOffset  FIRSTBATCH  2     getNameSearch.putExtrasearchoffset, finalOffset     getNameSearch.putExtrasearchlimit, FIRSTBATCH     getNameSearch.setActionIntentService.ACTIONGETNAMESEARCH     getSherlockActivity.startServicegetNameSearch     mCallback.onCreateProgressDialog  codepre

Negative 7528 pI have an application where it becomes extremely noticeable if my program uses an RNG that has patterns based on its seed, as it builds landscapes based on the x coordinate of the landscape. While codeRandomcode works well if youre calling codeNextcode every time, I need to be able to have the same output every time I use the same input, and thus cant rely on codeNextcode. Instead, I attempted to simply make a new codeRandomcode every time with the input seed. Not a very good idea, I know, and it showed. The patterns were extremely obvious, with alternating high and low values, and an noticeable overall trend across the entire landscape. Id prefer not to be making new generators every time, but even so, I looked into the cryptographically secure codeRandomNumberGeneratorcode to see if I could at least use it temporarily. As expected, though, I cant seed it, leaving me without any sort of reproducible output which is rather the point of the codeRandomNumberGeneratorcode. p  pIn short, neither of the two common RNGs appear to suit my purpose. I need to be able to take in a a number and return a random number based on that value without noticeable patterns in the output. Is there another way to use the above two, or is there a third I havent used before that would better suit my purposep  pFor clarity, the method Im trying to write looks like sop  precodepublic int RandomIntint input      int randomOutput     Be random     return randomOutput  codepre  pThat will return the same value every time the same codeinputcode is given.p

I create fields in the table and add the name address, town, state, etc,. of each new business I want to list with a marker.p  pAs of right now my map on my site works the same as on the google developers. The part specifically I am interested in changing is when you click one of the red or blue markers a pop up with the name and address appears. I would like to make the name of the business a link. OR if it would be easier create a fieldcolumn inside the table to be called url. I have done do and was able to see the output of the url field in xml format by calling the file directly. but it will not show up on the map.

The fixed function is bigger than the original one, so it cant be put into the same place.  p  pHere it isp  precodeinclude ltsystypes.hgt include ltstdio.hgt  define PMERRORINVALIDCLIENT

The abstract class is there so that I can refer a list of these students by doing something like List[Master[AnyVal]] Student.func1. p  pThe problem is that I cannot have the line val function List[A]  A as I get error covariant type A occurs in contravariant position in type  List[A]  A of value function. I dont know why the return type must be the contravariant of A. I can somewhat accept this fact for name based on the Function1 trait. p  pSo how would I define my function in the abstract Master class so that the return type is a contravariant of type A I found an example of how to define this with function definitions Ex. def function[B  A]v B List[B], but how would I implement this with an anonymous function Remember A in the master abstract class must be covariant since there will be a list of function that take in all AnyVal types Int, Double, etc.p  pReally appreciate the help Let me know if any of my terminology is off.  Scala Learnerp  precodeabstract class Master[A]      val function List[A] gt A   class Student[A lt AnyVal]val function List[A] gt A extends Master[A]  object Student  def func1      new Studentparams List[Int]gtparams0  params1   val myFunc  Student.func1 val someList  List[Master[AnyVal]]myFunc codepre
Negative 7528 pThis question is the culmination of two pieces of code guided by two answers here on SO. The first question I had was how to compare similarity between two strings and I got a good answer as seen a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions653157abettersimilarityrankingalgorithmforvariablelengthstringsherea with the following codep  pstrongcode 1strongp  precodedef getbigramsstring          Takes a string and returns a list of bigrams          s  string.lower     return  s[ii2] for i in rangelens  1   def stringsimilaritystr1, str2          Perform bigram comparison between two strings     and return a percentage match in decimal form          pairs1  getbigramsstr1     pairs2  getbigramsstr2     intersection  setpairs1 amp setpairs2     return 2.0  lenintersection  lenpairs1  lenpairs2 codepre  pAfter that I needed a way to sort the list of names for me to run them through the above code. I got the code a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma186891491082673herea as seen below p  pstrongcode 2strongp  precodeimport itertools persons  [Peter parker, Richard Parker, Parker Richard, Aunt May] similarity  [] for p1, p2 in itertools.combinationspersons, 2     similarity.appendstringsimilarityp1,p2     prints  s  p1, p2     strstringsimilarityp1, p2  similarity  sortedsimilarity, keyfloat printsimilarity codepre  pNow, the final hurdle is that my data is not in a list and is actually fetched from a database with primary keys which is what I ultimately want to track. Meaning when I compare multiple names, I need to mark that e.g. ID 1 and ID 2 are the most variant. For me to determine that those two IDs are the most variant, I need to sort the result of code1 above which looks like belowp  precodePeter parker  Richard Parker  0.5454545454545454 Peter parker  Parker Richard  0.5454545454545454 Peter parker  Aunt May  0.0 Richard Parker  Parker Richard  0.8333333333333334 Richard Parker  Aunt May  0.0 Parker Richard  Aunt May  0.0 [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5454545454545454, 0.5454545454545454, 0.8333333333333334] codepre  pIn my head instead of those names there I need the Primary IDs with which the names were fetched with so am thinking using a dictionary. Is there a way to run a dictionary of PIDName, PID1Name1, PID2Name2 using codecode2code, get the similarity value using codecode1code, sort the result and then know that names with the highest similarity are PID1 and PID3 Or is there a more elegant and less hair pulling way than am currently thinking...p

Negative 7528 pI have a TabBar application, with a Home tab and a Search tab. In the Home tab, I have a search bar, and when user clicks Search Id like to copy the text string into the Search tabs view controller and perform the search with that string.p  pIn order to pass the string, I am trying to send a notification and then forcing the TabBarController to switch tabs. Both these steps are working the issue is, I will only add the observer in the Search View Controller after loading it, which will happen only after I load the view for the first time. In other words, the notification is sent before the observer can be properly set up and, consequently, it is ignored.p  pWhat is the best solution for this problemp  pEditp  pOn Home View Controllerp  precode voidsearchBarSearchButtonClickedUISearchBar searchBar    [[self tabBarController] setSelectedIndex2]  Switch to Search VC   [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] postNotificationNameSearchFromHome objectself userInfoQuery  [searchBar text]]  codepre  pOn Search View Controllerp  precode voidviewDidLoad    [super viewDidLoad]     [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserverself selectorselectorsearchFromHome nameSearchFromHome objectnil]  codepre  pSearch View Controller wont observe the notification unless I load it first method codesearchFromHomecode is not called.p  pIf I try to perform a search right after the app loads it loads at the Home VC, notification will be ignored since Search VC is not yet set up to observe it.p

Negative 7528 pI am using Entity Framework with Code First. I have a table in my database that stores relationships between users. The table structure looks a lot like thisp  ul licodeRequestIDcodeli licodeUserFromIDcodeli licodeUserToIDcodeli ul  pBoth codeUserFromIDcode and codeUserToIDcode are foreign keys to my User table. p  pIn my User entity I have a virtual property called codeRelationshipscode setup. I want this property to be a collection of of all codeRelationshipRequestscode from the table listed above where the current users codeUserIDcode is either the codeUserFromIDcode OR the codeUserToIDcode.p  pThese are my bindings in the context p  precodemodelBuilder.EntityltUserProfilegt     .HasManye gt e.Relationships.WithRequirede gt e.UserFrom     .HasForeignKeye gt e.UserFromID.WillCascadeOnDeletefalse modelBuilder.EntityltUserProfilegt     .HasManye gt e.Relationships.WithRequirede gt e.UserTo     .HasForeignKeye gt e.UserToID.WillCascadeOnDeletetrue codepre  pBut once the relationships are retrieved for a user, the only relationships in the collection are the ones where the users ID is the codeUserToIDcode. I have tried swapping them around in which case the collection only contains the relationships where the users ID is the codeUserFromIDcode. It seems as though the second binding is overriding the first instead of appending to it like I expected. Im obviously doing this wrong. My question, is there another way to do this binding so that both keys are bound the way I want, or is this something I will have to implement another wayp  pThanksp

Negative 7528 pI have two tables with field codeusernamecode in both. How i can specify field name for both local and foreign table p  pI want CakePHP will do something likep  precodeON T1.username  T2.username codepre  pin result. Without any changes tables will be joined with following conditionp  precodeON T1.id  T2.t1id codepre  pSetting codeforeignkey  usernamecode property is not enough because it will produce query like thisp  precodeON t1.id  t2.username codepre  pI have two solutions. First one is use join property and join table on the fly. In such case i can set both local and foreign field. But if i need to join more tables to that one, joined manually, i cant use contain anymore i need to write following joins manually even if that associations was set correctly. So i need to write long join definitions every time instead just use codecontain gt arrayT1, T2, T3codep  pSecond is to set primarykey of table to corresponding field. It can be done in model file or in runtime. In my case it can not be done in model because that table also have correct association by its codeidcode field. Setup it runtime is the case but i dislike it because its not obvious and looks like a hack.p  pWhen i ask this question i thought i missing something obvious but now i understand that CakePHP just cant do that. So i started a bounty hoping that somebody share solution. If not i will try to read cake sources and redefine model some of method to add ability to define local field near the codeforeignkeycode in association definition.p

Negative 7528 pI am writing a template class called codeRootedBinaryTreecode, which has a linkedlistlike structure, whose elements are of type codeNodecode, which is a struct I have defined in the header file below. Each node in the binary tree has a codeparent Node code and can either have a codeleftChild Node code and a coderightChild Node code or no children. For example if you were to draw a rooted binary tree, it should look something like this a hrefhttpmathworld.wolfram.comimagesepsgifCompleteBinaryTree1000.gif relnofollowhttpmathworld.wolfram.comimagesepsgifCompleteBinaryTree1000.gifa. p  pA rooted binary tree has two members coderootcode and codecurrentPositioncode which are of type node.  When I overload codeoperatorcode I have to do something like codecurrentPosition  RHS.currentPositioncode which is what I have written there currently. I know this is incorrect, and that what I need to do is find the node in the codethiscode tree that corresponds to the codecurrentPosition Node code in the codeRHScode tree. p  pMy question is what is a good algorithm to traverse the RHS tree to find its codecurrentPosition Node code and find the corresponding codeNodecode in the invoking tree p  pMy idea is to create an empty string and traverse codeRHScode with some sort of depth first search algorithm starting from the root down until I find currentPosition, and keep track of the path I took to get there by appending a 0 to the end of the string if I went down the tree to the left, or a 1 if I went down the tree to the right, and then using that string to traverse the codethiscode tree, which should bring me to the corresponding codeNodecode. However, I know there must be a better way to do it partially from intuition, partially because my instructor told me there is a better way haha. p  pHere are the relevant files p  pRootedBinaryTree.hp  precodeifndef ROOTEDBINARYTREEH define ROOTEDBINARYTREEH   template ltclass Tgt class RootedBinaryTree  private     template ltclass Tgt     struct Node              T nodeData         NodeltTgt  parent          NodeltTgt  leftChild          NodeltTgt  rightChild           NodeltTgtNode                      parent  leftChild  rightChild  0L                     NodeltTgt  root     NodeltTgt  currentPosition       void copySubtreeNodeltTgt  amp target, NodeltTgt  const amp original     void deleteSubtreeNodeltTgt  n   public     RootedBinaryTreeconst T amp rootData     RootedBinaryTreeconst RootedBinaryTreeltTgt amp original     RootedBinaryTree      void toRoot     bool moveLeft     bool moveRight     bool moveUp      T getData const return currentPositiongtnodeData      RootedBinaryTreeltTgt amp operatorconst RootedBinaryTreeltTgt amp RHS     void combineTreesconst RootedBinaryTreeltTgt amp leftTree, const RootedBinaryTreeltTgt amp rightTree     void setNodeDataconst T amp nodeData    endif codepre  pRootedBinaryTree.cppp  precodeifndef ROOTEDBINARYTREECPP define ROOTEDBINARYTREECPP  include RootedBinaryTree.h  templateltclass Tgt void RootedBinaryTreeltTgtcopySubtreeNodeltTgt  amp target, NodeltTgt  const amp original   Assumes that targets leftChild  rightChild  0L.

My jface dialog is such that, it has a scrolled composite in which it holds a composite. In the main composite i have 3 other composites where i have to achieve this  functionality, so if i add dynamic widgets to a composite it might expand, but it should not overlap existing composites down to it, rather it should adjust other composites accordingly and also i should be able to dispose those widgets on a button click. Did any one try this dynamic addition and removal of widgets before, Im new to swt, jface . So, could any one share their experience here, Im posting the code ive tried.p  precodeimport org.eclipse.jface.dialogs.Dialog import org.eclipse.jface.dialogs.IDialogConstants import org.eclipse.swt.graphics.Point import org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Composite import org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Control import org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Display import org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Shell import org.eclipse.swt.custom.ScrolledComposite import org.eclipse.swt.SWT import org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Label import org.eclipse.swt.layout.GridData import org.eclipse.swt.layout.GridLayout import org.eclipse.swt.layout.FillLayout import org.eclipse.swt.layout.FormLayout import org.eclipse.swt.layout.FormData import org.eclipse.swt.layout.FormAttachment import org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Text import org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Button import org.eclipse.swt.events.SelectionAdapter import org.eclipse.swt.events.SelectionEvent   public class DynamicDialog extends Dialog      private Text text     private Text text1     private Composite composite             Create the dialog.       param parentShell           public DynamicDialogShell parentShell          superparentShell                  Create contents of the dialog.       param parent           Override     protected Control createDialogAreaComposite parent          Composite container  Composite super.createDialogAreaparent         container.setLayoutnew FillLayoutSWT.HORIZONTAL          ScrolledComposite scrolledComposite  new ScrolledCompositecontainer, SWT.BORDER  SWT.HSCROLL  SWT.VSCROLL         scrolledComposite.setExpandHorizontaltrue         scrolledComposite.setExpandVerticaltrue          composite  new CompositescrolledComposite, SWT.NONE         composite.setLayoutnew FormLayout          scrolledComposite.setContentcomposite         scrolledComposite.setMinSizecomposite.computeSizeSWT.DEFAULT, SWT.DEFAULT           final Composite composite1  new Compositecomposite, SWT.NONE         composite1.setLayoutnew GridLayout4, false         final FormData fdcomposite1  new FormData         fdcomposite1.top  new FormAttachment0         fdcomposite1.left  new FormAttachment0, 10         fdcomposite1.bottom  new FormAttachment0, 85         fdcomposite1.right  new FormAttachment0, 430         composite1.setLayoutDatafdcomposite1          Label label  new Labelcomposite1, SWT.NONE         label.setLayoutDatanew GridDataSWT.RIGHT, SWT.CENTER, false, false, 1, 1         label.setText1          text1  new Textcomposite1, SWT.BORDER         text1.setLayoutDatanew GridDataSWT.FILL, SWT.CENTER, true, false, 1, 1          text  new Textcomposite1, SWT.BORDER         text.setLayoutDatanew GridDataSWT.FILL, SWT.CENTER, true, false, 1, 1          Button btnDelete  new Buttoncomposite1, SWT.NONE         btnDelete.setTextdelete          final Composite composite2  new Compositecomposite, SWT.NONE         composite2.setLayoutnew GridLayout2, false         final FormData fdcomposite2  new FormData         fdcomposite2.bottom  new FormAttachment100, 91         fdcomposite2.top  new FormAttachment0, 91         fdcomposite2.right  new FormAttachment100, 10         fdcomposite2.left  new FormAttachment100, 74         composite2.setLayoutDatafdcomposite2         new Labelcomposite2, SWT.NONE          Button btnAdd  new Buttoncomposite2, SWT.NONE         btnAdd.setTextADD            btnAdd.addSelectionListenernew SelectionAdapter              Override             public void widgetSelectedSelectionEvent e                   Label label2  new Labelcomposite1, SWT.NONE                 label2.setLayoutDatanew GridDataSWT.RIGHT, SWT.CENTER, false, false, 1, 1                 label2.setText1                  Text text12  new Textcomposite1, SWT.BORDER                 text12.setLayoutDatanew GridDataSWT.FILL, SWT.CENTER, true, false, 1, 1                  Text text13  new Textcomposite1, SWT.BORDER                 text13.setLayoutDatanew GridDataSWT.FILL, SWT.CENTER, true, false, 1, 1                  Button btnDelete  new Buttoncomposite1, SWT.NONE                 btnDelete.setTextdelete                  Point p0  composite1.getSize                 composite1.setSizeSWT.DEFAULT,SWT.DEFAULT                 composite1.layout                 Point p  composite.getSize                 composite.setSizeSWT.DEFAULT,SWT.DEFAULT                 composite.setSizep                 composite.layout                                    return container                  Create contents of the button bar.       param parent           Override     protected void createButtonsForButtonBarComposite parent          createButtonparent, IDialogConstants.OKID, IDialogConstants.OKLABEL,                 true         createButtonparent, IDialogConstants.CANCELID,                 IDialogConstants.CANCELLABEL, false                  Return the initial size of the dialog.

Negative 7528 pSo heres something weird.p  pI have 3 elements An codeEditTextcode, a codeSpinnercode and a codeDatePickercode. Whenever a value in codeTextEditcode changes or when a codeSpinnercode value is selected, the codeDatePickercode gets updated accordingly. Specifically, the codeSpinnercode has the choice of MonthsWeeksDays, so the codeDatePickercode updates X weeksdaysmonths depending on the value in codeEditTextcode. Simple enough... but Im getting some very odd behaviour.p  pI have a listener on spinner amp text field that invokes a static codeupdateDatePickercode method on any change. Everything works fine on the text field change but for the spinner whenever I update from index 0 to index 2 from months to days, the date picker does NOT get updated  it stays the same date. The odd thing is, if I go from 0 to 1 to 2, or 2 to 1 to 0 it works and any transition tofrom index 1 works. I dont check for any special transitions, the codeupdateDatePickercode method simlply does a switch case on the codeselectedIndexPositioncode of the spinner and does its work accordingly.p  pI know the actual calculation is correct because I can print out the new date I want but its just the datepicker thats not getting updated.

Negative 7528 pSuppose you have a web application with AngularJS frontend and .NET Web Services backend. You need to apply a set of normalization rules for form values. For example, where saving an item Name youd like to ensure that it contains only single spaces, that Parkway inside address is replaced with Pkwy and Drive is replaced with Dr, that 90  Latitude lt 90, etc. Most of these rules are easy to set in terms of regular expressions.p  ol liYou would like the system to be easily upgradable to a future version, which is going to read those rules from a database.

Because these sweeps are short lived I have used a thread pool. Specifically a codeExecutors.newFixedThreadPool3code, 3 for the 3 axes.p  pMy test computer was a dual core with hyper threading, so up to 4 threads should be comfortable. sub Checked using codeRuntime.getRuntime.availableProcessorscode subp  h2Questionh2  pWhen running the following test code, in which numerous short lived tasks were run either single threaded or multithreaded using a threadpool the multithreaded version was much slower see profile data. This was the case even when the multithreaded parts had no objects in common. Why was this and is there any way to run many short lived 14ms tasks concurrentlyp  pEven making the tasks much much larger only makes the multithreaded version approach the single threaded in performance not exceed it as I had expected, which makes me think im doing something seriously wrong. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comirUXp.png altenter image description herep  h2Test codeh2

Negative 7528 pSo we are told that StringBuilder should be used when you are doing more than a few operations on a string Ive heard as low as three. Therefore we should replace thisp  precodestring s   foreach var item in items  where items is IEnumerableltstringgt     s  item codepre  pWith thisp  precodestring s  new StringBuilderitems.ToString codepre  pI assume that internally StringBuilder holds references to each Appended string, combining then on request. Lets compare this to the HybridDictionary, that uses a LinkedList for the first 10 elements, then swaps to a HashTable when the list grows more then 10. As we can see the same kind of pattern is here, small number of references  linkedList, else make ever increasing blocks of arrays.p  pLets look at how a List works. Start off with a list size internal default is 4. Add elements to the internal array, if the array is full, make a new array of double the size of the current array, copy the current arrays elements across, then add the new element and make the new array the current array.p  pCan you see my confusion as to the performance benefits For all elements besides strings, we make new arrays, copy old values and add the new value. But for strings thats bad because we know that a  b makes a new string reference from the two old references, a and b.p  pHope my question isnt too confusing. Why does there seem to be a double standard between string concatenation and array concatenation I know strings are arrays of charsp  pstrongStringstrong Making new references is badp  pstrongT  where T  Stringstrong Making new references is goodp  pemEditem Maybe what Im really asking here, is when does making new, bigger arrays and copying the old values across, start being faster than have references to randomly places objects all over the heapp  pemDouble editem By faster I mean reading, writing and finding variables, not inserting or removing i.e. LinkedList would kickass at inserting for example, but I dont care about that.p  pemFinal editem I dont care about StringBuilder, Im interested in the trade off in time taken to copy data from one part of the heap to another for cache alignments, vs just taking the cache misses from teh cpu and have references all over the heap. When does one become faster then the otherp

Please excuse what must seem like messy coding to you professionals but a lot of tutorials and trial and error to get this far.  p  precode    package com.example.mathtesttwo        public class MainActivity extends Activity   Override protected void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState      super.onCreatesavedInstanceState     setContentViewR.layout.activitymain        final TextView textOne  TextView findViewByIdR.id.textView3     textOne.setText4     final TextView guessText  TextView findViewByIdR.id.textView2     final EditText userGuess  EditText findViewByIdR.id.editText1      final TextView correctScore  TextView findViewByIdR.id.textView1      final TextView wrongScore  TextView findViewByIdR.id.textView4     wrongScore.setText0             String randText        Random randGen  new Random     int rando  randGen.nextInt11       randText  Integer.toStringrando     textOne.setTextrandText           Button pushMe  Button findViewByIdR.id.button1      pushMe.setOnClickListenernew View.OnClickListener           Override         public void onClickView v        int userNumber  Integer.parseIntuserGuess.getText.toString     int textNumber  Integer.parseInttextOne.getText.toString     int highScore  Integer.parseIntcorrectScore.getText.toString     int lowScore  Integer.parseIntwrongScore.getText.toString               if  userNumber 10  textNumber                   guessText.setTextyou got it correct             correctScore.setTextcorrect        highScore1                  else                  guessText.setTextWRONG                 wrongScore.setTextwrong  lowScore1                              String randText                 TODO Autogenerated method stub             Random randGen  new Random             int rando  randGen.nextInt11               randText  Integer.toStringrando             textOne.setTextrandText                   Override public boolean onCreateOptionsMenuMenu menu       Inflate the menu this adds items to the action bar if it is present.     getMenuInflater.inflateR.menu.main, menu     return true        codepre  pLOGCATp  precode0328 152419.314 DAndroidRuntime959 Shutting down VM  0328 152419.314 Wdalvikvm959 threadid1 thread exiting with uncaught exception group0x414c4700  0328 152419.484 EAndroidRuntime959 FATAL EXCEPTION main  0328 152419.484 EAndroidRuntime959 java.lang.NumberFormatException Invalid int correct1  0328 152419.484 EAndroidRuntime959  at java.lang.Integer.invalidIntInteger.java138  0328 152419.484 EAndroidRuntime959  at java.lang.Integer.invalidIntInteger.java138  0328 152419.484 EAndroidRuntime959  at java.lang.Integer.parseIntInteger.java366  0328 152419.484 EAndroidRuntime959  at java.lang.Integer.parseIntInteger.java332  0328 152419.484 EAndroidRuntime959  at com.example.mathtesttwo.MainActivity1.onClickMainActivity.java55  0328 152419.484 EAndroidRuntime959  at android.view.View.performClickView.java4240  0328 152419.484 EAndroidRuntime959  at android.view.ViewPerformClick.runView.java17721  0328 152419.484 EAndroidRuntime959  at android.os.Handler.handleCallbackHandler.java730  0328 152419.484 EAndroidRuntime959  at android.os.Handler.dispatchMessageHandler.java92  0328 152419.484 EAndroidRuntime959  at android.os.Looper.loopLooper.java137  0328 152419.484 EAndroidRuntime959  at android.app.ActivityThread.mainActivityThread.java5103  0328 152419.484 EAndroidRuntime959  at java.lang.reflect.Method.invokeNativeNative Method  0328 152419.484 EAndroidRuntime959  at java.lang.reflect.Method.invokeMethod.java525  0328 152419.484 EAndroidRuntime959  at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInitMethodAndArgsCaller.runZygoteInit.java737  0328 152419.484 EAndroidRuntime959  at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit.mainZygoteInit.java553  0328 152419.484 EAndroidRuntime959  at dalvik.system.NativeStart.mainNative Method codepre

If I run the same tests using a selenium via java. It takes only around 23 seconds which should be ideal.  I want to use protractor coz the application is entirely on top of angular.p  pI would guess that there maybe a default timeout of lets say 300ms after each tests. which make the tests slow. So even if the check is done it waits for the timeout.p  pIs there some polling mechanism so that if the test completes before timeout it can move forward.

Negative 7528 pIm trying to test a Rails controller concern though Im not sure this fact is at all related to my issue in RSpec, so I figured Id use an anonymous controller.

I test using Guard. When Guard detects a save of the spec file and runs this test, it passes and codeCheckpointcode is printed. Every time, completely deterministically. I can keep saving the file and it keeps passing. If it helps, Guard uses Spring and runs RSpec.p  pBut when I run the test with an RSpec command, it fails. Weirdest of all, I would have expected a failure to occur because something weird happens with the anonymous controller setup and it cant find the route, but instead its the codeshouldcode that fails the test. When I run RSpec manually in this way, codeCheckpointcode never prints, indicating that the anonymous controller action isnt getting called. But because I dont get a route error, emsomeem controller action must be getting called but I have no idea what, as I dont even have any other anonymous controllers with an codeeditcode function that could possibly conflict. Ive tried restarting Springno luck.p  pAny thoughts on what I could be doing wrongp  hr  pstrongEditstrongp  pHeres more info.

Negative 7528 pWhen you are working with a stronglong, bigstrong list, certainly one should use ListView because it handles cell recycling.p  pNotice here, for example a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions20696438Can i use nested linearlayouts instead of list view, for a big lista the OP is asking about ListView verses a dynamic LinearList  the answer is have to use a ListView, because of recyclingp  pNow, say you are making a short list  imagine say a popup with only 10 or 20 items. It may even fit all on the one screen, so theres no recycling.p  pIn fact, is there any difference between using a ListView and just using a LinearLayout, and dynamically populating the little views inside itp  pIt seems to me that the latter is in many cases much simpler, more elegant, and easier to work with. But I could well be missing something that seasoned Android engineers know about.p  pstrongShould I just use an ordinary LinearList populate it dynamicallystrong for lists where recycling is not relevant Whats the usual, and why Cheersp  pIncidentally,  for popup cases, is there some better, lightweight method for choose one from a popuplist that Im too silly to know about  p

Negative 7528 pI am having some difficulty designing a subclass of dataset in Matlab R2010b. I am experienced programming Matlab, but new to using its OOP features.

Some more code using col to determine val     end end end codepre  pIn my method computeValue, I am trying to access the data in the dataset using dataset syntax, i.e. on the command line I could access Field1 using .. It complains there is no method, property, or field Field1 for class mydataset. If I try the alternate syntax p  precodecol  doubleobj,Field1 codepre  pit complains about the size of obj, e.g. Index exceeds matrix dimensions.p  pI found a workaround using subsrefp  precodemethods     function [val]  computeValueobj         s.type  .         s.subs  Field1         col  subsrefobj,s          Some more code using col to determine val     end end codepre  pAlthough the workaround works, it is not very convenient and largely defeats the purpose of wanting a subclass of dataset.

Negative 7528 pIm trying to use this. in the some event functions for my Ember views such as didInsertElement to give me access to the actual DOM stuff that a view adds to the page.  Sometimes this works, and sometimes it doesnt.  I want it to work always.  After delving into ember.js somewhat, I think Ive learned that it fails, particularly, for a view that doesnt happen to add its own div or any other tag to the DOM to wrap the other DOM elements it adds.  This seems to be a normal format for the div tagp  precodeltdiv idember208 classemberviewgt ltdivgt codepre  pIn this case, I think ember208 is the value of the views elementId field and it appears that this. uses elementId to try to look up a single tag with that ID.p  pFor some views, there is no such tag.  For instance, if I make a route called whatever but dont define a WhateverView, then I dont seem to get that special div around the rendered contents of the whatever template.  Also, implicit views seem to crop up at other times...  I think the contents of an if block may get their own view  Anyhow, its clear that didInsertElement code often runs, for me, with an empty this..p  pI am seeing this especially often because Ive hooked up code to didInsertElement via View.reopenp  precodeEmber.View.reopen    uhhh function        console.logadd   this..length   .ondidInsertElement,    hmm function        console.logdel   this..length   .onwillDestroyElement  codepre  pIt seems I have tampered with dark magics here.  I want these functions to basically let me detect every element that Ember adds to or removes from the DOM, right after its been added or before its removed.  But that length is often zero.  My perusal of the source code seems to indicate it will always be zero, except where the view gets its own wrapper tag.  I do not, in fact, want EVERY view to get its own wrapper tag.  If I want to watch Embers changes to the DOM in this way, but without having wrapper tags for every view, then...  what do I dop  pstrongEditstrongp  pClarification  I dont necessarily want didInsertElement to be called once for every DOM element that Ember adds.  Rather, I want the addition of any one element to have one corresponding call to didInsertElementwith many elements potentially sharing the same call.  So if Ember adds a whole templates worth of elements all at once, then one call to didInsertElement in which this. represents either the single newly added ancestor of all those newly added elements, or the collection of all the added elements themselves, or the collection of all their topmost newly added ancestors if there werent a single one, would serve me well.p

Negative 7528 pIve created this game using Javascript, and I play all sounds including effects and background music using the Audio type. It works perfectly when I run the page from my computer, but after I uploaded on my host and tried to run from the web, it started to sounds really terrible sometimes it is delayed, sometimes it does not play at all.p  pIve noticed that the main problem is related to playing the same audio more than once in a short amount of time it plays a shooting sound whenever the user clicks on the page, so usually it isnt that bad when theyre not spamming their mouse, but once you start clicking many times the sounds turns out terrible. p  pThe audio file for that particular sound is very short, and when running from my computer is has no problem even when the user is clicking very fast.

Negative 7528 pI have a View Controller that displays 3 custom views. My question is, would it be better to create a XIB for each subview or notp  pI have been told that loading a XIB file is really expensive, so its better to have just one XIB for the View Controller and avoid having XIB for the custom views in that controller. However, in order to avoid that, I have seen the custom views constraints set by code as there is no XIB for them and no way to use the IB, which I dont like. Thats why Im wondering if its fine both a good practice and strongefficientstrong to create a XIB for each subview and set then set the constraints using the IB.p  pThanks in advance.p

The resulting GUI looks something like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comkeZ8e.png altRuntime GUIp  pWhen the system receives the tree, it creates the GUI using the description but emdoesntem immediately populate the components with the data. This is due to the design of the system which lets it update the components in realtime as their bound variables are changed on the server when the server is queried or updated, the updated variable is sent over a ServerSocket and placed on an codeupdate queuecode, which then invokes codenotifyObserverscode on the data model objects that represent the kdb variables. The components, which are observing their respective models based on the codebindingcode tree values, are then given the new data to display. p  h2Problemh2  pUpon rendering the GUI from the tree, the codeJFrame.setVisibletruecode is called, and the components all send queries to the server asking for their data. The data objects are sent back one by one on the update queue, and the observers are notified subsequently.p  pAt this point, the frame is tiny since the components are visible, but empty. At the moment Im calling codeJFrame.packcode after each update message is strongconsumedstrong by the data model objects, which in itself is a waste of resources, but it makes sure that once the components have been populated they all are displayed properly.p  h3BUTh3  pIf the user resizes the Frame to make it bigger, and then the data on the server is updated, the codeJFrame.packcode method is invoked again when the new data is added to the update queue, so the frames resize will be undone. Im wondering if theres an equivalent to codepackcode that only fits the frame if the current size doesnt fit all of the data. p

Negative 7528 pI have a synchronous task but sometime thread get stuck while making a remoting call which blocks the execution. So I want to make remote call making part async using a ThreadPool thread , but my idea is to keep it synchronous as much possible, that is I want main thread to wait for a timout value or ThreadPool thread to complete ,so that this activity is asynchronous only in case of thread stuck.  ThreadPool thread doesnt give any handle so that I can call thread.jointimeout on that and I cant use autoreset events also as that part of code can be accessed by multiple threads so which thread sets  resets autoreset event becomes even complicated and also it is an overhead.p  pCan you please suggest a cleaner way for this problem  I cant create Thread also using Thread class because as I mentioned above that area of code can be accessed by multiple threads and it is a small task that remote call does ,something like updating a text like progress .p  pCode Snippetp  precodepublic static Exception AddProgressSession session, ITaskSetProgress progress    IIconUIServer server  IconRemotingServer.Instance.GetUiServersessiongets remote proxy object   server.AddProgressprogress calls a method over remoting IPC channel   codepre  pAnd this method can be called by more than one thread at a time.p  pMy intention is to write AppProgressAsync method ,so that when call  codeserver.AddProgressprogresscode hangs then only it should behave as async ,so I have a timeout .p  pI cant use Task Library as I need to support old customers who are on .net 3.5 still.p

Negative 7528 pI am trying to get a little script running on one of my home servers. My webserver 192.168.1.100 serves a website which has to get information from another server 192.168.1.225. This server generates a plaintext file. However, the script on my website refuses to load information from any other website because of the SameOriginRule. The only possibilities to solve this problem are either to place both files on the same server or to enable CORS. Former is not possible, so I did a little research about latter. I found that enabling CORS is done by adding the header AccessControlAllowOrigin, so I did this, without solving the problem.p  pThat means, I have the followingp  pcodeServer A 192.168.1.225 generates and serves a plaintext file on every GET request.codep  pcodeServer B 192.168.1.110 serves a simple interface and displays information received by Server B trough javascript.codep  pcodeServer B serves the following filecodep  precodelthtmlgt  ltheadgt   ltmeta httpequivAccessControlAllowOrigin contentgt   ltstylegt ... ltstylegt  ltheadgt  ltbodygt   ltpgtThis is the parsed content of somefile.cgiltpgt   ltscriptgt    function httpgeturl      var xmlHttp  new XMLHttpRequest     xmlHttp.openGET, url, false     xmlHttp.sendnull     return xmlHttp.responseText         function parsepagepage       Parse some content         var page  parsepage httpgethttp192.168.1.225foobarsomefile.cgi     document.writepage   ltscriptgt  ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pHow can I enable CORS and why is it not working the way I didp  pcodeTLDR ClientSide javascript served by 192.168.1.100 needs to get the content of 192.168.1.225foobarsomefile.cgi.codep

Negative 7528 pIm working on a website that is going to be offline. All the html files will be in a folder stored on the harddisc. Ive managed to do 90 of the work and the last part I have no idea of. Here is what it isp  pI have stored a list of products in the localStorage as various strings under the keys  like buying objects and it goes to the cart, the cart objects are in localStorage. I created a page that showed the list of all the products in the localStorage. It can be cleared if the user clears them. Now I need to create a page where all the objects that was selected before, regardless of the localStorage being cleared, show as list in this page. You can take it as the page that lists products that have been ordered in the past, i.e even after the cart is cleared the products will show in the pastorders page.p  pI do not know any server side codes, I did everything using JavaScript as it was supposed to be a simple project, but Im stuck at this part. So I cannot use PHP or anything to generate files or use a database to store stuff.p  pHeres what I thought but I dont think it works but wanted to confirm if it does or not Generate an XML file or a .txt file and store it in the drive and then clear the localStorage. But I dont think it is possible. If its possible just using JavaScript please point me in the right direction and Ill research and come up with something.p  pP.S. the website will be entirely offline what I mean is the users will never connect to the internet for this to work. Also there wont be a server or localhost.p  pThank youp  pThe site is completely offline, but functionality is similar to an eCommerce site. You click a button and some content from the website stores in the localStorage and I have to call it in multiple pages, when a user clicks another button, localStorage clears but whatever was selected before must be available without localStorage. Hmmmm.. Consider a quiz site where you answer everything and when you take a new quiz, old scores will be stored somewhere else and it wont change when you take a new test.p  pIs it possible to attain this functionality without a server side script It seems the finaltargetedusers wont know how to install any softwares that can provide a localhost or a server or something like that.p

I have noticed that it works perfectly fine if you give an input which exists in the file, however can someone help me understand why the program never exits the loop if you give an input which does not exist in the text file, even though it should exit when the variable with the text from the file becomes codenullcode.

Negative 7528 pusing JPA 2.1 is it possible to map a many to many relationship which carries attributes on the junction table while the object layer has those attributes on one side  For examplep  precodeCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS mydb.ThoroughfareAddress    ID BINARY12 NOT NULL,   AddressNumber INT NULL,   AddressNumberSuffix VARCHAR10 NULL,   StreetNamePremodifier VARCHAR45 NULL,   PRIMARY KEY ID  CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS mydb.Person    ID BINARY12 NOT NULL,   FirstName VARCHAR45 NULL,   LastName VARCHAR45 NULL,   PRIMARY KEY ID  CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS mydb.AddressType    Type INT NOT NULL,   ShortName VARCHAR45 NULL,   LongName VARCHAR255 NULL,   PRIMARY KEY Type  CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS mydb.PersonThoroughfareAddress    PersonID BINARY12 NOT NULL,   ThoroughfareAddressID BINARY12 NOT NULL,   AddressType INT NULL,   Comment VARCHAR255 NULL,   PRIMARY KEY PersonID, ThoroughfareAddressID,   INDEX PersonThoroughfareAddressFK1idx ThoroughfareAddressID ASC,   INDEX PersonThoroughfareAddressFK3idx AddressType ASC,   CONSTRAINT PersonThoroughfareAddressFK1     FOREIGN KEY ThoroughfareAddressID     REFERENCES mydb.ThoroughfareAddress ID     ON DELETE NO ACTION     ON UPDATE NO ACTION,   CONSTRAINT PersonThoroughfareAddressFK2     FOREIGN KEY PersonID     REFERENCES mydb.Person ID     ON DELETE NO ACTION     ON UPDATE NO ACTION,   CONSTRAINT PersonThoroughfareAddressFK3     FOREIGN KEY AddressType     REFERENCES mydb.AddressType Type     ON DELETE NO ACTION     ON UPDATE NO ACTION codepre  pOr more simply, you have a Person table, a ThoroughfareAddress table, an AddressType table with entries for things like home, work etc, and a junction table connecting Persons to ThoroughfareAddresses and also carrying the AddressType.  So the type is on the junction entry, allowing for things like one concrete address being a work address for one person, while it is a home address for another.p  pMeanwhile this is modeled in Java with a Person object having a set of ThoroughfareAddress objects, and the AddressType is an attribute of the ThoroughfareAddress class.  So it has been collapsed into the instance.  p  precodeEntity public class Person      Id     ColumncolumnDefinition  BINARY16, length  16, updatable  false, nullable  false     private byte[] id     private String firstName     private String lastName     private Set ltThoroughfareAddressgt thoroughfareAddresses   Entity public class ThoroughfareAddress      Id     ColumncolumnDefinition  BINARY16, length  16, updatable  false, nullable  false     private byte[] id     private String addressNumber     private String addressNumberSuffix     private String streetNamePremodifier     private AddressType addressType     private String comment   public enum AddressType      PRIMARY,     OTHER  codepre  pI cant see how to map this model to that schema.  I can see how it would work if the object model included a class for the junction table, but it doesnt.  Sorry for the length of this, I just joined and cant post an image of the schema which would have been briefer.p

Negative 7528 pI have a url rewrite rule that works fine on my local server xampp , but when I put it inside the .htaccess of a typo3 site wont work . This is how this rule looks like  p  precodeRewriteCond DOCUMENTROOTtest1.html f [NC] RewriteRule . test1.html [L,R] codepre  pand she redirects every request that ends up with www.site.comname to www.site.comname.html with showing the .html extension in the url bar . Like I said , this rewrite rule works successfully on my local server , but applied on a normal website  not a typo3  , the .htaccess of the typo3 website contains a hole bunch of other rewrite rules written by another programmer , so these are the 2 rational reasons that preventing it from working  p  p1st  the already in .htaccess existing rewrite rules overwrite the one I created eventhough when I add it at the very bottom of the file p  p2nd  maybe because the structure of the typo3 cms is different , which I dont really think it can affect on the .htaccess rules , but .. I still find it a possible reason unless someone confirm me the opposite.p  pI would really appreciate it if someone could really help me making it work using the .htaccess file and not relying on one of the extension like RealUrl .p

Negative 7528 pIm trying to work out of I can take advantage of a caching layer in my web application or not and if so which technology. p  pOur web app has and internal and external component and I would like if possible to add an inmemory cache tier between the Web App and DB Tier for the public external component. We are suffering DB performance issues and I want to alleviate stress on the DB as much as possible plus make our public facing site of the component lightening fast.  p  pThe external component offers a location search facility based on a post code. E.g enter post code for an area and you get 50 results back each time the data is relatively stale the DB might change new record added 1 per day so I was thinking if a cache tier was possible then I could invalidate the cache nightly and then load it again as opposed to the cache aside pattern. p  pQuestionp  ol liBased on my overview above e.g. postcode mapping to multiple records JSON or serializable objects can I use a cache tier to store the data inmemory total size of data 100 MG, heaps of RAM free and retrieve multiple records back per post code based on a caching technology keyvalue data storesli liIf number 1 above is feasible, what caching technology, we are using a PHP front end, Zend server has an immemory cache but it doesnt look mature, I would prefer Redis over Memcached for caching, thoughtsli liIf preloading the cache nightly is not achievable, thoughts on a better approach to utilise the cacheli liIf inmemory caching is not achievable at all based on my requirement then should I look at opmtiising the DB its SQL Server, e.g. loading the search table into SQL cache on SQL Server startupli liOther, something Im missingli ol  pThanks in advance, all comments welcomep  pCheers,p

Negative 7528 pI have a 2D particle system for a game engine in which I want to decouple the update loop of the particles from the main thread.  I am using a thread pool implemented with boostasio and am splitting up all the tasks into several stages and then combining the results on the main thread.  This works well for me, and guarantees a limit on the total threads I have allowed for the pool which is shared by all particle emitters which fire their own tasks independently.p  pI have read a lot of articles discussing stdasync and stdfuture.  This seems to be totally reasonable on windows or linux type systems where thread creation is well managed by the OS and memory is bountiful. But it seems like very little focus is spent on discussing this kind of thing in a mobile platform where thread creation may be costly.  Because I am not sure how many threads might be made on these platforms it seems hard to rely on stdasync in contexts where I dont know how many async calls may be in action at a given time if each creates its own thread.p  pa hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosdocumentationCocoaConceptualMultithreadingCreatingThreadsCreatingThreads.htmlapplerefdocuid10000057iCH15SW2 relnofollowhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosdocumentationCocoaConceptualMultithreadingCreatingThreadsCreatingThreads.htmlapplerefdocuid10000057iCH15SW2ap  pI would like to hear from an individual with multithreaded C mobile development experience.  My question in summary is thisp  pIf I create 20 particle effects, each with 4 concurrent async tasks, will this result in 100 threads each taking .5 mb of ram  Or does async have some magic support for being intelligent with thread creation and task sharingp  pAlternatively will async bog down the main thread if not being explicit with the thread creation rule effectively lagging my gameplay for relatively lowpriority particle effectsp  pIf so, what context is async strongactuallystrong useful in on mobile as it seems thread creation is something youd like to be a little more explicit about on these devices.p

Both should be able to commitpull changes between themselves but only the MASTER can pull or commit changes to a remoteonline repository, lets say on bitbucket.p  pThe two workstations can share their git repos thru the Windows Filesharing Service.p  pHow would you implement thisp  pTake into account that the most difficult part is the implementation of a mechanism to pushfetch towards the remoterepo, since the first step sharing between the two local repositories seems to work like a charm.p  pFor instance this is a snapshot related to a commit towards the online repop  precode    private static int eventtest46     private static int eventtest32 codepre  pActually with regard to what I expect the situation should be as followp  precode    private static int eventranktest32     private static int eventranktest46 codepre  pit seems like the last commit is always overridden by the last but one.p
Negative 7528 pI have a access codelistboxcode that has 2 columns and the column width is...20 so the second one is hidden. p  pI know I can do a codecontroltipcode to display a single line but the values in the 2nd column are quite long.  They are descriptions of what is in column 1. p  pHow can one display a codetextboxcode with the value in the 2nd column when hovered over a specific item in the list boxp
Negative 7528 pWe have developed multiclient application i.e. the business logic resides on server side and the interfaces are exposed via REST API and mobilewebclient consumes the APIs.p  pThe application allows different users to signuplogin to get user specific data. We use http digest based authentication and a token mechanism to keep track of user state.p  pHowever, we want to restrict the access of APIs i.e. only our registered mobilewebclient could access them. So we introduced a second layer of authentication and named it service layer authentication. We are using our custom token based system just like we did for user authentication. The over all flow for mobile clients is good enough for us but for webclients we have issues. If we embed the user credentials in Javascript, anyone can extract those credentials and consume the APIs.p  pIn summary, all we want is to identifyauthenticate the Javscript based webclient upon ajax calls.p  pP.S. Just for clarification, with webclient I mean our web application not the browser.p
Negative 7528 pI want to join against a huge partitioned table. The planner probably assumes that the partitioned table is very cheap to scan.p  pI have the following queryp  precodeselect   from          select users where age lt 18 limit 10      as users      join      clicks on users.id  clicks.userid where     clicks.ts between 20150101 and now codepre  pThe table codeclickscode is the master table with roughly 40 child tables containing together about 40 million records.p  pThis query performs very slow. When I look at the planner postgres first performs a complete scan of the codeclickscode table and then scans the user table.p  pHowever when I limit the codeuserscode subquery to 1 the planner first scans the users and then the clicks.p  pIt seems as if the planner assumes that the codeclickscode table is very lightweight. If I look at the stats in codepgclasscode the master table codeclickscode has 0 tuples. Which is true on the one hand because it is a master table, but on the other hand, for the planner it should contain the sum of all its child tables.p  pHow can I force the planner to use the cheapest option firstp  hr  pstrongeditstrong in simplifying the query I indeed missed out an additional  constraint on the date.p  pThe partitioning constraints are on codeclicks.tscode and codeclicks.useridcodep  pI have indexes on codeusers.agecode, codeuser.idcode, codeclicks.useridcode and codeclicks.tscodep  pMaybe I have to trust the planner. I am just a little insecure because I once had a case where postgres showed some weird behavior with limits a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions21385555postgresqlqueryveryslowwithlimit127237698PostgreSQL query very slow with limit 1a.p

Negative 7528 pI have a client that is sending params such as age, gender, name and so on. I need to retrieve data from the table based on the params, but first I need to check for the presence of the paramto avoid a null param and therefore an empty result. The params are working as filters, so they can be triggered or they can be left blanck. What I am doing right now isp  precoderetieve  Student.all   unless params[age].nil     retrieve  retrieve.whereage params[age] end    unless params[gender].nil     retrieve  retrieve.wheregender params[gender] end codepre  pand so on for every param I receive. This way I check if the filter has been selected, and if it has I use the selection as a parameter for the query It works, but as Ruby is known for the DRY statement, I am pretty sure someone out there knows a better way for putting this and to make this flexible.

Negative 7528 pI currently have a spring mvc app that gets a list of users from a database and displays their information in a table using JSP to basically loop through each object in the list and create a table row for them.p  pEach user has an expiry date attribute as part of their record in the database. What I want to achieve is basically a button that when toggled shows or hides all users that have expired i.e. their expiry date is less than todays date.p  pFor this I am trying to use AJAX calls to my controller to fetch me all users expired or not OR only users that havent expired depending on how the button is toggled.p  pWhat I would like help on is the best way to achieve this as I can think of a few nasty ways of doing it like having a separate page and refreshing but I am confused on a few things. p  pShould I just ditch the JSP looping through to make the table and make a method in JavaScript that creates that table when given the data If so how do I get the data from the controller to JavaScript, can an AJAX call to a controller return me a list of my user objects p  pMy best guess is that instead of adding a list of objects to a model and letting JSP do the work, that I instead return a JSON with the data and use JavaScript to build the table. I can then call an update method to rebuild the table. p

Aside from that, the keys that will be available for a particular date is not definite.p  pHeres the HTMLp  precodeltdiv ngcontrollerMyControllergt     ltnvd3stackedareachart     dataData     idGraph2     showXAxistrue     showYAxistrue     showLegendtrue     objectEqualitytrue     interactivetrue     marginleft80,right80     width500     height200     tooltipstrue     xAxisTickFormatxAxisTickFormatFunction     yAxisTickFormatyAxisTickFormatFunction     tooltipcontenttoolTipContentFunction      gt         ltsvggtltsvggt     ltnvd3stackedareachartgt ltdivgt codepre  pIs there a way to fix it Using the attributes in nvd3 Or do I need to programmatically create a javascript code that will add a data to a key that doesnt have a data dor a specific datep
Negative 7528 pI have a custom Linearlayout that combines some views together. I want this Linearlayout to be wrapcontent for the height. I tried adding layout params in the custrucor like thisp  precodeLayoutParams params  new LayoutParamsViewGroup.LayoutParams.WRAPCONTENT,                                         ViewGroup.LayoutParams.WRAPCONTENT setLayoutParamsparams codepre  pbut it has no effect. the height is still matchparent.

Negative 7528 pIve come up against a problem I thought was reasonably common, but havent been able to find a valid solution for. Im using AFNetworking 2.0 to create a queue of operations to download different resources from my custom REST API. p  pMy main request is for a resource with a lot of objects think 1000 and for efficiency Im limiting it to return 100 at a time, however we dont know what the size of the complete dataset is until the first response is available. This means that after processing the first response, another request needs to be sent with an updated offset value, until the complete collection is returned.p  pSince the operation queue uses completion and failure blocks, I thought about building a new operation from the completion block in a recursive way, but you cant assign a completion block from within itself. p  pHow do I dynamically enqueue an operation when I dont know how many requests will be necessary p  pHeres code to show what Im trying nowp  precodeblock NSInteger returnLimit  100 void failureBlockAFHTTPRequestOperation operation, NSError error  AFHTTPRequestOperation operation, NSError error      NSInteger code  [operation.response statusCode]     NSLogError  Code ld, error, code  void completionBlockAFHTTPRequestOperation operation, id responseObject  AFHTTPRequestOperation operation, id responseObject      NSDictionary  responseDictionary  NSDictionaryresponseObject     NSInteger returnOffset  [[responseDictionary objectForKeyoffset] integerValue]     NSInteger returnTotal  [[responseDictionary objectForKeytotal] integerValue]      NSArray  responseData  [responseDictionary valueForKeyPathdata]     NSLogfound lu objects, [responseData count]     [model processResponseresponseData]       check if everything has been downloaded     if incidentTotal  incidentOffset gt incidentLimit          NSURL  newRequestURL  [model constructURLForPathresource withParametersoffset  [NSNumber numberWithIntegerreturnOffsetreturnLimit], limit  [NSNumber numberWithIntegerreturnLimit]]         NSURLRequest newRequest  [NSURLRequest requestWithURLnewRequestURL]         AFHTTPRequestOperation  nextOperation  [[AFHTTPRequestOperation alloc] initWithRequestnewRequest]         nextOperation.responseSerializer  [AFJSONResponseSerializer serializer]         [nextOperation setCompletionBlockWithSuccesscompletionBlock failurefailureBlock]         NSArray  newOperations  [AFURLConnectionOperation batchOfRequestOperations[nextOperation] progressBlockNSUInteger numberOfFinishedOperations, NSUInteger totalNumberOfOperations              NSLogincident lu of lu, numberOfFinishedOperations, totalNumberOfOperations          completionBlockNSArray operations              NSLogNew request done         ]         [[AFHTTPRequestOperationManager manager].operationQueue addOperationsnewOperations waitUntilFinishedNO]        NSURL  originalRequestURL  [model constructURLForPathresource withParametersoffset  [NSNumber numberWithInteger0], limit  [NSNumber numberWithIntegeroriginalLimit]] NSURLRequest originalRequest  [NSURLRequest requestWithURLoriginalRequestURL] AFHTTPRequestOperation incidentOperation  [[AFHTTPRequestOperation alloc] initWithRequestoriginalRequest] originalOperation.responseSerializer  [AFJSONResponseSerializer serializer] [originalOperation setCompletionBlockWithSuccesscompletionBlock failurefailureBlock]   start the queue codepre
Negative 7528 pIm building an Android app that needs to communicate with a server over TCP sockets. I know that networking should be done off the UI thread but Im not sure which threading approach to go with an IntentService or AsyncTask. I read that the you should use services if you have to run something continually in the background, and use AsyncTask for oneoff tasks but I find this rather vague. For my application I only need to communicate with the server on startup and when a user clicks some button, which would seem to favour AsyncTask since this seems like a oneoff task. What would be the benefit and downside of using AsyncTask over an IntentServicep

What drives his work is sparsity, limitation, constraint. This attitude is perfectly expressed in the interim identity he designed for the New Institute launched 2013, which combines three existing institutions The Netherlands Architecture Institute NAI Premsela, The Netherlands Institute for Design and Fashion and Virtueel Platform, for eculture. With no money available for the intervention, Martens took the graphic identity designed by Bruce Mau for the Netherlands Architecture Institute represented in the CHNDM collection, 200043113 and printed over it in black, allowing enough of the old identity to show through to reveal the history behind the project, and then punched or printed three holes in the paper or envelope to represent the united institutions. As the New Institute press release stated, With Martensu2019 design, history is not only visible but it is also literally given a new layer, symbolizing a new mission and ambition. From the New Institute identity campaign, Mr. Martens is donating eighteen pieces. This campaign provides a nice process story, since it demonstrates the transition from the logo material prepared by Bruce Mau to the New Institute, allowing us to see how a company or nonprofit adjusts a prior graphic design campaign given a change in mission or circumstance.,     gallerytext null,     labeltext null,     videos null,     ondisplay null,     woecountry 23424909,     type Note card,     images [                      b                  url httpsimages.collection.cooperhewitt.org87603ae15c6c8f5c06f3db.jpg,                 width 511,                 height 1024,                 isprimary 1,                 imageid 87603             ,             z                  url httpsimages.collection.cooperhewitt.org87603ae15c6c8f5c06f3dz.jpg,                 width 319,                 height 640,                 isprimary 1,                 imageid 87603             ,             n                  url httpsimages.collection.cooperhewitt.org87603ae15c6c8f5c06f3dn.jpg,                 width 160,                 height 320,                 isprimary 1,                 imageid 87603             ,             d                  url httpsimages.collection.cooperhewitt.org87603ae15c6c8f5c06f3dd.gif,                 width 160,                 height 320,                 isprimary 1,                 imageid 87603             ,             sq                  url httpsimages.collection.cooperhewitt.org87603ae15c6c8f5c06f3dsq.jpg,                 width 300,                 height 300,                 isprimary 1,                 imageid 87603                           ],     participants [                      personid 18064377,             roleid 35351535,             personname Karel Martens,             persondate Dutch, b. 1939,             rolename Donor,             roledisplayname Donated by,             personurl httpcollection.cooperhewitt.orgpeople18064377,             roleurl httpcollection.cooperhewitt.orgroles35351535         ,                      personid 18064377,             roleid 35236655,             personname Karel Martens,             persondate Dutch, b. 1939,             rolename Designer,             roledisplayname Designed by,             personurl httpcollection.cooperhewitt.orgpeople18064377,             roleurl httpcollection.cooperhewitt.orgroles35236655              ],     tombstone          epitaph Note Card, New Institue Flyer, 2013.

Negative 7528 pI try to make a hybridwebapp with Phonegap3.7.0 and AngularJS that uses geolocation. My problem is that geolocation works in a browser, but not when I build the project in Phonegap and try to run it on a mobile device.

As I move the joystick, the program draws the blue line within the bounds listed on the screen.  x is input as a number between 0 and 65535, and after moving the joystick around a little bit the system recognizes that as the max and the min, and then proceeds to function as expected.p  pThe second joystick is less of a joystick and more of a pressure sensor.  This outputs either x  1023 or x is some number between 5 and 9.  In this case however, the blue line appears on the same level as the max line, or when the data output is x in the single digits, the blue line appears below min.  I havent been able to figure out why this would be the case, the first joystick can also produce results of 0, but it never goes below the minimum line.  What might be causing this particular issuep

Negative 7528 pstrongdoTheMathint[][], int [][], charstrong Takes two 2dimensional integer arrays as parameters and returns a 2dimensional array of integers. Its third parameter, a character, tells the method which arithmetic operation to perform. It will make a new array that is the same size as the arrays that come in through the parameters. It will use the character parameter to determine which operation to perform when filling the new array. For example, if the character parameter holds a  symbol, this method will add the corresponding entries in each array and place their sums in the same position in the new array.

Negative 7528 pI want to somehow dynamically change the MAC addresses of the devices to prevent tracking.p
Negative 7528 pI have an application that presents 3 different quizzes one at a time over a 3 week period. It is being used as an internal employee contest aimed at giving knowledge about one of the clients products. I have coded the front end using .NET aspx pages and it displays the quiz. I then have a class file that is being used to grade the quiz. What I am stuck on is the correct approach to store the answers in the class. Obviously the answers will be static and not change. There are 5 questions per quiz. p  pOne approach I thought of was to declare some variables in the class that grades the quiz, one per answer per quiz and then pass in the quiz that has been taken and use the contents of those variables to grade the quiz. That is not very objectoriented. So, without over complicating things, would it be better to create a class for each quiz that has the answers and then I can create an instance of that class and just read in Class.Answer1, etc A rough example would bep  precodepublic class QuizOne     public property answer1  A    public property answer2  B    public property answer3  B    public property answer4  C    public property answer5  E  codepre  pI could have one class like this per quiz. Then I could have some code in the grading class that looks up which class to instantiate and then once instantiated I could dop  precodeifquiz.answer1  answered1  do something for the correct answer   else   do something for the incorrect answer  codepre  pThoughts or suggestionsp

Negative 7528 pI cant clone a repository using Android StudioIntellijIdea due to the error seen below in the green box.  I have configured Git and the test of it succeeds.  The confusing thing is I just installed IntelliJ and Git on another machine and was able to clone the same repository using the same steps last night.  I updated Android studio to the latest in the stable channel and also downloaded the latest version of git.p  pIf I use the command line I can clone the repository as well as push but not from inside IntelliJ, any ideas whats going onp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com3vj3T.png altThe problemp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comCWR4I.png altenter image description herep

Negative 7528 pIm using Solr to pull information from a Database and a file system simultaneously. The database houses the file path of the file in the file system. It pulls all of those just fine.

When I clear the index and run the program again it submitsdoesnt submit the same documents. p  pAnd it will index certain PDFs it just wont index others.

Negative 7528 pwe are building an Android app which is tested by using Appium. Now I would like to see the test coverage of our Appium tests. I think this is possible, because Jacoco supports offline instrumentation a hrefhttpwww.eclemma.orgjacocotrunkdocoffline.htmlhttpwww.eclemma.orgjacocotrunkdocoffline.htmla.p  pAnd even the documentation of the jacoco gradle plugin saysp  blockquote   pWhile all tasks of type Test are automatically enhanced to provide coverage information when the java plugin has been applied, any task that implements JavaForkOptions can be enhanced by the JaCoCo plugin. That is, any task that forks Java processes can be used to generate coverage information.p blockquote  psee a hrefhttpsdocs.gradle.orgcurrentuserguidejacocoplugin.htmlhttpsdocs.gradle.orgcurrentuserguidejacocoplugin.htmlap  pBut how do I have to write the build.gradle so our acceptance debug flavor is instrumented and the exec file is written to the Smartphone when the Appium tests are executed or even manual test cases are executed Because then I can extract the exec file and send it so SonarQube for further analysis.p  pThanks Benp
Negative 7528 pOn this a hrefhttptriathlon.joomlatest01.mmsdev.com relnofollowtest sitea, I had a fancybox lightbox popping up fine. Then I added code in hopes to have it only popup on FIRST visit, but never again after.  So I have some JS below that runs setCookie when either link in the lightbox is clicked.

Negative 7528 pThis is probably a very simple question for you all who thoroughly understand InterOp.  I have an app that builds an Excel workbook consisting of four worksheets with the last sheet containing charts and tables derived from the data on the other three spread sheets.  Im working in C using Visual Studio 2010 and .NET 4.5.  I must use 4.5 to produce the 3D charts required. Everything is working fine as I develop and test in my environment. But when I install the app on an XP machine running .NET 3.x  I get a message saying it is necessary to install .NET 4.  My question  Is there any way I can include the necessary elements of .NET 4 in my install package so the user will not have to also install .NET 4p

Those were my attempts which I tried after reading several similar questions, here on Stack Overflow to remove all the strongbackslashesstrong and also these  strongustrong, which were also present there.p  pBut, after all those tries, I am unable to remove strongALLstrong the strongbackslashesstrong and strongustrong. p  pNow, if I dont remove all of those, I am not able to access the jsonresponse using its keys, So, it is very essential for me to remove ALL of them.p  pPlease help me resolve this issue. It would be better, if you provide a code , in particular for my case issue, and not a general code ratherp  pMy Code is herep  precodefrom twisted.internet import reactor from scrapy.crawler import CrawlerProcess, CrawlerRunner import scrapy from scrapy.utils.log import configurelogging from scrapy.utils.project import getprojectsettings from scrapy.settings import Settings import datetime from multiprocessing import Process, Queue import os from scrapy.http import Request from scrapy import signals from scrapy.xlib.pydispatch import dispatcher from scrapy.signalmanager import SignalManager import json , simplejson , ujson  queryrawinputEnter a product to search for  querybag query1query.replace ,      class DmozItemscrapy.Item      productname  scrapy.Field     productlink  scrapy.Field     currentprice  scrapy.Field     mrp  scrapy.Field     offer  scrapy.Field     imageurl  scrapy.Field     outofstockstatus  scrapy.Field  class DmozSpiderscrapy.Spider     name  dmoz     alloweddomains  [httpwww.firstcry.com]       def startrequestsself          taskurls  [         ]         i1         for i in range1,2             temp  httpwww.firstcry.comsvcssearch.svcGetSearchPagingProductsnewPageNo  stri  ampPageSize20ampSortExpressionRelevanceampSubCatIdampBrandIdampPriceampOUTOFSTOCKampDISCOUNTampQ  query1  amprating             taskurls.appendtemp             ii1          starturls  taskurls         plentaskurls         return [ Requesturl  starturl for starturl in starturls ]       def parseself, response         print response          items  []         jsonresponse  dictujson.loadsresponse.bodyasunicode        jsonresponse  jsonresponse.replace,        jsonresponse  jsonresponse.decodestringescape        jsonresponse  r  json.loadsresponse.bodyasunicode        d jsonresponse.json         jsonresponse  jsonresponse.strip        print jsonresponse        print d        print json.dumpsr  jsonresponse, indent4, sortkeysTrue        a  simplejson.dumpssimplejson.loadsresponse.bodyasunicode.replaceu,, indent4, sortkeysTrue         a json.dumpsjson.JSONDecoder.decodejsonresponse         a  ujson.dumpsujson.loadsresponse.bodyasunicode , indent4          ajson.dumpsjsonresponse, indent4         aa.decodestringescape         aa.decodestringescape        a.gsub,          a  a.strip         print jsonresponse         print a         print r  a        print r  json.loadsresponse.bodyasunicode          pjsonresponse[hits][hit]        print p        rawinput         for x in p             item  DmozItem             item[productname]  strx[title]             item[productlink]  httpwww.yepme.comDeals1.aspxCampIdstrx[uniqueId]             item[currentprice]Rs.   strx[price]              try                             px[marketprice]                 item[mrp]  Rs.   strp              except                 item[mrp]  item[currentprice]              try                             item[offer]  strx[promotionalMsg]             except                 item[offer]  strNo additional offer available              item[imageurl]  httpstaticaky.yepme.comnewcampaignstrx[uniqueId][1]strx[smallimage]             item[outofstockstatus]  strIn Stock             items.appenditem          print items  spider1  DmozSpider settings  Settings settings.setPROJECT, dmoz settings.setCONCURRENTREQUESTS , 100  settings.set DEPTHPRIORITY , 1 settings.setSCHEDULERDISKQUEUE , scrapy.squeues.PickleFifoDiskQueue settings.set SCHEDULERMEMORYQUEUE , scrapy.squeues.FifoMemoryQueue crawler  CrawlerProcesssettings crawler.crawlspider1 crawler.start codepre
Negative 7528 pI have 5 dropdowns in a table in my asp .net app, and Im using jQuery to add and remove rows of those 5 dropdowns dynamically. Ive got the functionality working in terms of the UI, but the example here a hrefhttpwww.codeproject.comArticles781851AddDeleteRowsDynamicallyusingjQueryinASPNE relnofollowhttpwww.codeproject.comArticles781851AddDeleteRowsDynamicallyusingjQueryinASPNEa uses fileupload in the current http context for enumerating access to the controls, and since there is only one fileupload control per row that makes it easy.p  pI am completely stumped how to access each rows 5 dropdown controls I have in a loop, so i can set the values in a List.p  pCodep  precodeltdivgt

Negative 7528 pAfter reading several stack posts about WHY you might want to use an codeltimggtcode or codeltobjectgtcode tag to reference a svg file, Ive yet to find one that answers a specific question i have with regards to CSS and svg codeltpathgtcode tags. If you embed the svg into the js or html, you can manage all hover events for example, in the CSS rulesp  pA CSS rule like so if i wanted to have a hover effect on a svg map of buildings. p  precodepath[idbuilding]hover      opacity 0.5  codepre  pBut if the svg file is very large 200kb, full of path vectors, and you want instead reverence the svg instead see below samples, then you will break the above CSS rule. All paths with id beginning with building will stop showing the hover effect of .5 opacity. p  precodeltobject typeimagesvgxml datahttplocalhost49031my.svg width300 height300gtltobjectgt codepre  pOrp  precodeltimg idmap srchttplocalhost49031my.svggtltimggt codepre  pI cant seem to wrap my head around a way to access the paths inside a reference svg file. Ive started reading on codeltusegtcode and codeltggtcode svg tags, but i have not come across the missing link that pulls this all together for me. p  pIMPORTANT NOTE I realize you can specify codeltstylegtcode tags inside each svg, but i would rather not manage my code this way if there is a better option, which Im sure there is. These svgs will be used as a svg map, with clickable hotspots that trigger maps in and out of view so individual buildings, or rooms on a floor plan can be selected, and write the objects id to a form field. p

Negative 7528 pCurrently, I am working on a problem where events with certain sequence numbers arrive at the server. The arrive in proper sequence, but may get processed out of order. While acking back, I have to ensure that I ack the even with highest sequence number which doesnt have a unprocessed event before. I.e. if I ack 100, that means events 0 to 100 are processed, but event 101 yet to get processed. p  pI am keeping the sequence numbers in in list sorted in Python. I keep popping the processed band of events from the beginning of the list and so. The number of events that the process may be working on may be huge 100000 or so and hence keeping all their sequence numbers in the list may be a performance issue, then popping some elements from the beginning of the list may also have performance issues, locating an element in the list also a performance issue as it will be a linear search.p  pIs there setmapconcurrentskiplist equivalent in Python Python set doesnt keep the items sorted as in case with C set from STL.p

Now Im aware that jQuery Mobile automatically stylizes elements to have their width fill the page, and that might be why this is occurring strongbut I cant seem to override it.strong The image below has the blue and gold coloring because Im inspecting it with chrome inspector the blue background is the divs width and the gold space to the right is its margin. a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comX7a7O.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comX7a7O.png alttwo divsap  pFirst of all, the image I am using is naturally much larger than the space that I actually want it to occupy, so I used the following styles...Ive tried using strongdisplay inlinestrong, but that makes the image huge again and seems to cancel out the effect these styles had in making the image conform to the surrounding div p  precodeltimg srcincludesimagesheart.jpg stylemaxwidth 100 height autogt codepre  pto resize it according to the div that surrounds it, which has these styles p  precode.partImageSect         margin 0 important     width 50     height 50vh  codepre  pThe second div the black one has these stylesp  precode.partControlSect      width 50     height 50vh     background black  codepre  pNo matter what I do I cant seem to remove the width. strongAgain as I mentioned before, I realize that the natural way to deal with this would be to use inline styling, but then I dont know how to resize the image to fit within its div wrapper .partImageSect.strongp  pPlease help...p

Negative 7528 pI doubt whether theres a solution to this but thought Id ask anyway.p  pcodejava.awt.Robotcode is very useful for unit testing, to simulate user inputaction. The trouble is you cant then do anything else on your comp for the duration of the test, because the Robot keyPresses, etc., will then start happening in the application which has focus at the time, not in the app which you are subjecting to testing...p  pEven if you precede every such Robot command with coderequestFocuscode or some such this is not a solution for the simple reason that between such commands, which must be run in the EDT, and the Robots command, which must be run in a nonEDT thread, you may happen to do sthg keyboard or mouse action which will transfer focus outside the test app.p  pI think therefore that a Robot which knows it must interact only with the test app is kind of essential.  Without that you lose your machine for the duration of the tests.  p  pRunning the tests in a VM might be one solution  does anyone know of any otherp
