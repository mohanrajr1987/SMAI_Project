Positive 7002 pSo Im trying to copy a backup of the data from my app. I wrote the batch script below to do this, but the script takes forever to run. p  pI start the batch script at 1am, and it is still running at 830am. This seems weird to me because when I copy the backup of my app manually in Windows File Explorer, it copies in 715 minutes depending on network traffic.p  pI codeREMcode the codebackupcmd CProgram FilesAppApp ServerDataBackups drivecode line. That was the original line of batch script I used to backup the data, and it worked efficiently up till a month ago. p  pSo I tried the codexcopycode command with codedcode, so it would only copy source files that have been changed on or after that date the current date, and the backups Im copying are made at 1201am every night and the copy backup script starts at 1am. p  pAny advice as to how to speed up my codexcopycode would be appreciated.

Negative 7002 pI am writing a Python utility that needs to parse a large, regularlyupdated CSV file I dont control.  The utility must run on a server with only Python 2.4 available.  The CSV file does not quote field values at all, but the a hrefhttpwww.python.orgdoc2.4.3libcsvfmtparams.htmlcsvfmtparams relnofollowPython 2.4 version of the csv librarya does not seem to give me any way to turn off quoting, it just allows me to set the quote character codedialect.quotechar  code or whatever.  If I try setting the quote character to codeNonecode or the empty string, I get an error.p  pI can sort of work around this by setting codedialect.quotecharcode to some rare character, but this is brittle, as there is no ASCII character I can absolutely guarantee will not show up in field values except the delimiter, but if I set codedialect.quotechar  dialect.delimitercode, things go predictably haywire.p  pIn a hrefhttpdocs.python.orglibrarycsv.html relnofollowPython 2.5 and latera, if I set codedialect.quotingcode to codecsv.QUOTENONEcode, the CSV reader respects that and does not interpret any character as a quote character.  Is there any way to duplicate this behavior in Python 2.4p  pstrongUPDATEstrong Thanks Triptych and Mark Roddy for helping to narrow the problem down.  Heres a simplestcase demonstrationp  precodegtgtgt import csv gtgtgt import StringIO gtgtgt data   ... 1,2,3,4,5 ... 1,2,3,4,5 ...  gtgtgt reader  csv.readerStringIO.StringIOdata gtgtgt for i in reader print i ...  [] Traceback most recent call last   File ltstdingt, line 1, in  csv.Error newline inside string codepre  pThe problem only occurs when theres a single doublequote character in the emfinalem column of a row.  Unfortunately, this situation exists in my dataset.  Ive accepted Tanjs solution manually assign a nonprinting character codex07code or codeBELcode as the quotechar.  This is hacky, but it works, and I havent yet seen another solution that does.  Heres a demo of the solution in actionp  precodegtgtgt import csv gtgtgt import StringIO gtgtgt class MyDialectcsv.Dialect ...     quotechar  x07 ...     delimiter  , ...     lineterminator  n ...     doublequote  False ...     skipinitialspace  False ...     quoting  csv.QUOTENONE ...     escapechar   ...  gtgtgt dialect  MyDialect gtgtgt data   ... 1,2,3,4,5 ... 1,2,3,4,5 ...  gtgtgt reader  csv.readerStringIO.StringIOdata, dialectdialect gtgtgt for i in reader print i ...  [] [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] codepre  pIn Python 2.5 setting quoting to csv.QUOTENONE would be sufficient, and the value of codequotecharcode would then be irrelevant.  Im actually getting my initial dialect via a codecsv.Sniffercode and then overriding the quotechar value, not by subclassing codecsv.Dialectcode, but I dont want that to be a distraction from the real issue the above two sessions demonstrate that codeSniffercode isnt the problem.p

Negative 7002 pWhere is a good mathematical sets implementation for JavaScript It should include efficient implementations of intersection, union, complement, and for bonus points the Cartesian product.p  pNo, its not homework. I got a yubikey, it is a USB keyboard that types a sequence chosen from 16 keycodes to type a 128bit one time password otp. To make it more useful, software should detect the keyboard layout based on the characters produced and map those characters back to what they would be in the us layout for compatibility with the existing backend.p  pSo Ive got 93 different sequences of 16 characters representing everything the yubikey can type in each of 430 keyboard layouts. Many layouts are the same for this purpose. The possible mappings for a particular otp is each 16character sequence that contains every character in the otp.p  pTo find this efficiently I use a reverse index mapping each possible character to a list of the keyboard layouts that use that character. The answer is the intersection of each entry of the reverse index for each unique character in the otp. This almost always winds up with exactly 1 element.p  pIt would be easier to write this crossbrowser with a good implementation of codeSetcode.p  pCode so far is at a hrefhttpdingoskidneys.comdholthyubikey relnofollowhttpdingoskidneys.comdholthyubikeyap

Negative 7002 pFor the specific needs of a project, I have to interface some of my code with other closedsource code. My idea is to understand how the original application communicates and then mimic the behaviour. I have already done the first step, which is analysing some HTTP exchanges done using POST request and XML replies with a hrefhttpwww.wireshark.org relnofollowWiresharka. At the end of the exchange, the server produces an output that I need to record.p  pNow, my question is what is the strongeasieststrong way to replicate the client behaviour with my input ie the one that involves less coding Basically I dont need much programming power, just the ability to parse some variables in the server responses and reuse them in the successive request.p  pIve already done a similar job replicating the client behaviour with a commandline PHP script, but its rather tedious and the code is hardly readable and hence maintainable.p  pAny suggestion is welcome Thanksp
Negative 7002 pI have an application that is written in SBCL and is deployed as an executable on Windows. The need has arisen for it to interact with Excel via COM and another application via DDE I know, I know.p  pDDE is simple enough for me to have emquicklyem wrapped what I needed in a very small, simple to maintain C library. COM, on the other hand, seems like a large enough project to just implement this portion of the functionality in Python with the Win32 extensions library.p  pThis, to me, is annoying in that a lot of CL code is being augmented with some Python that is of varying degrees of integration with the main project.p  pIve seen that LispWorks and Allegro CL both allow for COM interaction but cannot find any open source implementations of the same functionality via google or CLiki.p  pDoes such a thing existp
Negative 7002 pIve heard well read, at a hrefhttpwww.ddj.comwindows184416861 relnofollowhttpwww.ddj.comwindows184416861a, that its possible to set custom properties on a Win32 window.p  pThe trouble is, the download for the article above is on an ftp server that wont let me in.p  pAs a bit of background info, I have a .NET app.  The main window is registered to handle custom window messages. From a separate app, I need to post messages to this window.  I cant find the window by caption as the caption changes.  I cant find it JUST by window class, as the window class is the same for all forms in that app domain.p  pIdeally, Id like to set a custom property on the Win32 window of the main form Form1 that say, yes, this is form1.  Then when Im enumerating the windows of this app, I can tell that this is the required form by seeing if this custom property exists.p  pCheers,p  pStevep

Negative 7002 pI have been throwing stuff together in a small test game over the past 6 months or so, and right now everything is in the one project. I would like to learn more about creating an engine for reusability and I am trying to figure out the best way to do this.p  pStatic Libs are obviously a tiny bit faster, as they are compiled in rather than loaded at runtime, but that really does not matter to me. The advantages of DLLs over static libs seems rather large. So im wondering what the best approachmost used approach is for a game engine.p  pI am using Ogre3D rendering engine which supports dll plugins that it loads and what not, but I would like to write my dlls where I could basically use them anywhere. So would my best bet be to write individual DLLs for each portion of my sample engine, such as sound.dll, gui.dll, etc Or would I be better served by creating one large dll, deemed engine.dll or something I am assuming the best approach would be to write something like...engine.dll for the general structure, then compose it of other dlls such as soundguiinputetc.p  pWould it be silly of me to write my dlls independently of Ogres Plugin system My Sound relies on the FMOD library, my GUI relies on the CEGUI library, and so on. I mainly just want to create my engine to a point where it is easily usable with the functions I need from the individual librarys.p

Negative 7002 pIm trying to add paths to my classpath in the Clojure REPL that Ive set up in Emacs using ELPA. Apparently, this isnt the CLASSPATH environment variable, but rather the swankclojureclasspath variable that Swank sets up. Because I used ELPA to install Swank, Clojure, etc., there are a ton of .el files that take care of everything instead of my .emacs file. Unfortunately, I cant figure out how to change the classpath now.p  pIve tried using setq swankclojureextraclasspaths list ... both before and after the ELPA stuff in my .emacs, and Ive tried adding paths directly to swankclojureclasspath in .emacs, .emacs.dinit.el, and .emacs.duseruser.el, but nothing works.p  pWhat Im ultimately trying to do is to add both the current directory . and the directory in which I keep my Clojure programs. Im assuming swankclojureclasspath is the thing I need to set here. Thanks for your help.p

Negative 7002 pI have a C application which dynamically loads plugin DLLs. The DLL sends text output via stdcout and stdwcout. Qtbased UI must grab all text output from DLLs and display it.

Thus any output sent to wcout isnt reaching my buffer because C runtime truncates strings at nonprintable ASCII characters present in UTF16 encoded strings. Calling strongsetlocalestrong demonstrates, that C runtime does string reencoding. strongsetlocalestrong is no help for me for very reason that there is no knowledge of the language or locale of the text, since plugin DLLs read from outside the system and there might be different languages mixed. After giving an Nthought I have decided to drop this solution and revert to coutwcout buffer replacement and putting requirement for DLLs to call initialization method due to both reasons UTF16 not passing to my buffer, and then the problem of figuring out encoding in the buffer. However, I am still curious of whether there is a way to get UTF16 strings through C runtime into pipe as is, without localedependent conversionp  pp.s. any suggestions on coutwcout redirection to UI rather than the two mentioned approaches are welcome as well p  pThank you in advancep

Negative 7002 pThe assignment is as followsp  blockquote   pThe gas station consists of 2 pumps. Each pump has a certain amount of fuel it can distribute. Cars arrive at random intervals and attempt to use one of two pumpsbrbr      If a pump is available and has fuel, the car is immediately allowed to use it. Each car requires a certain amount of fuel random number, and has to wait for a time proportional to that amount of fuel. For example, a car may need 6 gallons and will use the pump for 3sec, another car may need 10 gallons and will use the pump 5 seconds, etc. When the car is fueled up, it leaves and the another car can use the pump. After fueling a car, the amount of fuel in the pump is adjusted accordingly.br      If both pumps are currently being used, then an arriving car waits until one of the two pumps becomes available.br      If a pump runs out of fuel, it must wait for a tanker to provide more fuel. The tanker arrives periodically but not too often, and fills both pumps to capacity. While a tanker is servicing the pumps, no cars can use the pumps.     forgot to add this brbrPart I you must submit a detailed design that matches the above specifications.

Negative 7002 pso Im extremely new to Android development.  The only thing that Ive actually coded is Hello World.  Then I used Google App Inventor but realized that that was not what I needed.  Ive also read through the developers guide.  Anyway, Im working on a project where we use various sensors accelerometers by means of a wiimote and strain gauges converted to a digital signal through an Arduino microcontroller and process the data on an Android tablet which will display the data for the user.  Then the processed data will be uploaded to a website.  Before I do anything else I need to plan out how to build this using Application Components and I wanted to make sure my general ideas are correct before I start trying to code and run into complications.  So below is a list of how I think this application should user each of the application components.p  pstrongActivitiesstrong The user displayp  pstrongServicesstrong Timerp  pstrongBroadcast Receiversstrong Listen for new accelerometer data Listen for new strain gauge data p  pstrongContent Providersstrong Send the data to a website.p  pSorry for asking such a basic question, but I find its best to understand a tool well before I use it and Ive been told that this place is noobfriendly.  Thanks for your time.p

Negative 7002 pSo Ive found myself with a conundrum.  We have some old asmx web services in our app that have worked fine for ages.  p  pAll of the sudden they stopped working on the build server CI. I say stopped working, because even though the service description displays when I navigate to the service, invoking any operation doesnt get routed to the service Web Form Routing.  There are 2 strange issues that arose in my attempt to fix this problem.p  p1. After shelving all my pending changes, grabbing latest from TFS, and doing a local build emwhich unless Im mistaken, will get me what is on the build server since we buildpush with each check inem. I noticed that I cant duplicate the error locally.p  p2. Even though I cant duplicate the error locally, I still suspect routes, however the routes for all our services are added to the table first, and look like this  codeservice.asmxpathInfocode, I guess this was added as a safety precaution as something like emMyService.svcem shouldnt even make it to the router, as the file actually exists, though Im not sure if that rule applies for emMyService.svcMyMethodemp  pIm not really sure how to test routing, i.e. where to set a break point to know if Im going through the route table for a particular request or not, so any pointers in that area would be appreciated, as well as any other ideas as to why this might be happening.p  pThanksp
Negative 7002 pWe have pretty large files, the order of 11.5 GB combined mostly log files with raw data that is easily parseable to a csv, which is subsequently supposed to be graphed to generate a set of graph images.p  pCurrently, we are using bash scripts to turn the raw data into a csv file, with just the numbers that need to be graphed, and then feeding it into a gnuplot script. But this process is extremely slow. I tried to speed up the bash scripts by replacing some piped codecutcodes, codetrcodes etc. with a single codeawkcode command, although this improved the speed, the whole thing is still very slow.p  pSo, I am starting to believe there are better tools for this process. I am currently looking to rewrite this process in pythonnumpy or R. A friend of mine suggested using the JVM, and if I am to do that, I will use clojure, but am not sure how the JVM will perform.p  pI dont have much experience in dealing with these kind of problems, so any advice on how to proceed would be great. Thanks.p  pstrongEditstrong Also, I will want to store to disk the generated intermediate data, i.e., the csv, so I dont have to regenerate it, should I choose I want a different looking graph.p  pstrongEdit 2strong The raw data files have one record per one line, whose fields are separated by a delimiter codecode. Not all fields are numbers. Each field I need in the output csv is obtained by applying a certain formula on the input records, which may use multiple fields from the input data. The output csv will have 34 fields per line, and I need graphs that plot 12, 13, 14 fields in a may be bar chart. I hope that gives a better picture.p  pstrongEdit 3strong I have modified adiraus script a little and it seems to be working pretty well. I have come far enough that I am reading data, sending to a pool of processor threads pseudo processing, append thread name to data, and aggregating it into an output file, through another emcollectorem thread.p  pPS I am not sure about the tagging of this question, feel free to correct it.p

Negative 7002 pIs there a way to define a custom warning in Eclipse  Howp  h3My motivationh3  pI have a Large Number of classes that are exposed as JavaScript objects via Mozilla Rhino.  Ive run across a couple bugs like thisp  precodepublic void jsFunctionfooString bar    if bar  null      ...    else      ...     codepre  pThe Bug A String parameter in a codejsFunctioncode IS NEVER NULL.  If the JavaScript calls codefoonullcode, the parameter that arrives is codenullcode, not codenullcode.  HUGE difference.p  pThe solution is to declare the parameter as codeScriptablecode, and then convert it if presentp  precodepublic void jsFunctionfooScriptable bar    if bar  null      String barStr  convertToStringbar     ...    else      ...     codepre  pSo anyway.  We have 50 classes we expose in JavaScript.  Rather than schlepping through them all by hand, Id like to automate the process.  Something likep  precodeif function.name.indexOfjsFunction  0 ampamp     function.paramTypes.containsString.class ampamp     stringParamComparedToNullfunction   addWarningfunction.lineNum, It doesnt work like that codepre  pIdeally this custom warning would be shared across my team or even with the Mozilla Rhino project itself so other folks wont keep making the same mistakes.p  pA way to crash Eclipse for people that compare to null would be good too.

Negative 7002 pI am working on a softrealtime event processing system. I would like to minimise as many calls in my code that have nondeterministic timing. I need to construct a message that consists of strings, numbers, timestamps and GUIDs. Probably a codestdvectorcode of codeboostvariantcodes. p  pI have always wanted to use codeallocacode in past code of a similar nature. However, when one looks into systems programming literature there are always massive cautions against this function call. Personally I cant think of a server class machine in the last 15 years that doesnt have virtual memory, and I know for a fact that the windows stack grows a virtualmemory pageatatime, so I assume Unices do as well. There is no brick wall here anymore, the stack is just as likely to run out of space as the heap, so what gives  Why arent people going gaga over aloca  I can think of many usecases of responsible use of alloca string processing anyone .p  pAnyhow, I decided to test the performance difference see below and there is a 5fold speed difference between alloca and malloc the test captures how I would use alloca. So, have things changed Should we just throw caution to the wind and use codeallocacode wrapped in a codestdallocatorcode whenever we can be absolutely certain of the lifetime of our objects  p  pI am tired of living in fear  p  pstrongEditstrongp  pOk so there are limits, for windows it is a linktime limit.

Negative 7002 pI am currently developing an application that connects to multiple database engines 2 right now, but this will grow in the future but does similar things on each database. I would like to develop a set of unit tests that I only have to write once, but can be run on a different database engine. This application will be extremely complex, and I predict that I will be writing hundreds if not thousands of tests for it. p  pFor example, I have a method that retrieves all the databases available in a database server, and I have two classes which have the same interface that defines the GetDatabases method.  I would like to develop one method that creates an instance of a class that implements IDatabaseEngine, and call the GetDatabases method on it. p  pI then want to call this method once with my MySQLDatabaseEngine class, and once again with my SqlServerDatabaseEngine class and test the output.p  pI am currently using MSTest, because this is what I am most familiar with, but I am not against switching my test engine if it proves to be unsuitable for this task. As I only started this morning, I have only written three tests for this so far, so switching would not be a problem at all.p  pIt may not even be necessary to do something different with the configuration of MSTest, but to develop some sort of test harness inside MSTest to run a method twice with different parameters. However, I would like to avoid any sort of situation where I have to p  pI have considered code generation, but I would really like to avoid this.p

Negative 7002 pI know this is a question that has been asked over and over but Im attempting to implement permission based rather than role based authorization in an ASP.NET MVC application.  So instead of just having high level roles like Manager, Admin, or User, I need to have permissions like ViewTask, AddTask, DeleteTask.  I have read a ton of comments on this and it seems like the easiest solution is to just treat roles as permissions and define roles of ViewTask, AddTask, and DeleteTask.p  pIs such an approach really a good idea  Some of my concerns are that you could end up with over 100 roles depending on the size of the application which would then rule out the ability to do role caching in cookies and thus every call to User.IsInRole hits the database.  If every action method is going to be decorated with [AuthorizeRolesXXXX] am I going to see serious performance issuesp  pMy other issue is that I still want to keep the concept of a role around so that an administrator can simply associate a user with a role that has a predefined set of permissions.  Using the approach above my thought was to create a separate entity in my application named Group and that Group would be responsible for keeping track of the ASP.NET roles that are assigned to that Group.  So, when a user is associated with a Group, I can retrieve the ASP.NET roles that need to be assigned to the user and add all the roles.p  pHas anyone implemented a system in such a way Any opinions or thoughts on this approach would be appreciated.  p  pThanksp

Negative 7002 pI have an app which uses view flippers for different tabs. On one tab I have the main flipper, which is displayed when the app is launched. This contains a list view. Objects in the list view then have a detail page which is displayed when clicking on them.p  pI have a second tab called favourites, which allows the user to add these list objects to the favourites list. Clicking on an item in the favourites list brings the user to the same detail page as in the main flipper. p  pIn this detail page, there is a text view, which shows the title of the object selected.

Negative 7002 precode2amp 15 7 3 1  codepre  pAbove is the phrase. At the end is the trace and the final outcome.  I understand that the phrase is a monad, I understand that because of  it has a left and right argument.  The same output happens if you run 15 7 3 12amp 15 7 3 1.  I also get that the right table are powers of 2 to the 1, 3, 7, 15, and the other entries are their base number times that power of 2, but I just do not understand why.  p  pOn a related note, this is a phrase from ethopian multiplication on the Rosetta Code website actually this is, as well, I got this far in trying to figure that out and  1.lt.a is the phrase.p  precode1gt.lt.a 27 27 13 6 3 1 codepre  pbut      1.lt. 27  returns a boxd version of itself and I would expect it to run 27 times.p  pOn a final of three related questions, these are all related to decomposing the ethopian multiplication code, the complete code is given asp  precodedouble   2amp halve    amp2           NB.  or the primitive   odd      2amp  ethiop   odd]  double lt 1gt.lt.halvea codepre  pand that can be trivially substituted asp  precodeethiop   2amp]  2amp lt 1gt.lt.a codepre  pAnd that works fine  Flushed with success, I fell completely off of the cliff when I thought, there is a monadic double that works on the command linep  precode 98 196 codepre  pAnd a double operator has to be faster than a double with an attached constant, maybe double just shifts, so I would think thatp  precodeethiop   2amp]   lt 1gt.lt.a codepre  pWould work...but it does not.  p  pI have tried caps, conjunctions, and so forth, and nothing gets it to work, it always says, domain error.  I am beginning to think that the code depends on the dyadically called monad to create the doubling table in a way I do not get.p  pThe only good thing is that the J verb odd has nothing to do with testing for an odd number.p  pCan anyone explain these things to me, maybe with an English explanation of how the program works  Not how the algorithm works, how it implements the algorithm.  I recall when I was playing with IBM 1130 APL back in 1970.  This was an APL interpreter that ran in 8k words, needless to say, it was limited.  For example, it had a roll but no deal. The interpreter phased itself in and out of memory, the 1130 supported code overlays, it would separate your subroutines into groups and when one group called another, it would load the new group off of disk yes, pseudo swapping in 8k. So I wrote versions of deal, using various schemes, and randomly, we would hit one that could phase in and out without seeking, and that version, no matter how badly written with how many lines and how many interpreter actions would run 10 times as fast as any other.  I had no idea what I was doing, I would keep adding ravels and meaningless assignments and breaking statements across lines or combining them until I got one that would run without seeking.  A 52 deal 52 that was seeking could take 45 seconds.  p  pAnd then last night I calculated the 150,000th Fibonacci number in J.  It had to be the 64 bit version, and it took one hour, 17 minutes.  I used exact arithmetic, the number has 31349 digits and it starts 1012838344936638038......  And I realized that the 1130 could never have calculated this, the number would not have fit, cause you need three of them and the biggest one made had 32k 16 bit words.  I want to learn the language that can do this, but there is something missing from the doc that I am just not getting.p  precode trace 2amp 15 7 3 1    4 Conj   2  amp    2amp   3 Adverb   2amp    2amp   8 Paren     2amp    2amp   0 Monad   2amp  15 7 3 1  491520 229376 98304 32768    1920    896   384   128     120     56    24     8      30     14     6     2    491520 229376 98304 32768    1920    896   384   128     120     56    24     8      30     14     6     2 codepre  pFibonacci Footnotep  precode]t150k62 a150k   r150k   ,2amp. 150000 0x 1x 4631.62  0 60 60  t150k 1 17 11.6167 r150k 10128383449366380384728502706681008427227914006240871521944866167854579423510169 50198752571599303492471943589300904953648270811064370506598260395645679940891823 17307901573781852234222080308236027906733606532470814177610613237408102006595571 1949713927351702... a150k 31349 codepre

Negative 7002 pI am designing a webservice interface for use between a Windows CE device and a PC. The Windows CE device is server and the PC is client.p  pI have decided to use the a hrefhttpgsoap2.sourceforge.net relnofollowgSOAPa library to implement the server and I am using .NETC for the client. I have followed the approach described a hrefhttpguruce.comblogposthostingwebservicesonwindowsembeddedcompactwindowsceusinggsoap relnofollowherea and everything is working well.p  pMy question is about how to best implement an asynchronous callbackevent from the server to the client. I can think of two methodsp  ol liContinuously polling the server for active eventsli liA blocking method that keeps the connection open until an event occursli ol  pI have currently chosen option 2 and it seems to be working well. I use an asynchronous method in the client and therefore get a callback when the method completes, i.e. when an event occurs on the Windows CE device. I then immediately call the same method again so it is ready for the next event.p  pExample server method no error handlingp  precodeint nsWaitForEventstruct soap soap, int eventId      WaitForSingleObjecthMyServerEvent, INFINITE     eventId  GetCurrentEventId     return SOAPOK  codepre  pExample client no error handlingp  precodeprivate void SubscribeToServerEvents      var server  new MyMethods.ServicePortTypeClient                         new BasicHttpBinding,                          new EndpointAddressmyIpAddress     AsyncCallback cb  this.Callback     server.BeginWaitForEventcb, server   private void CallbackIAsyncResult ar      var server  MyMethods.ServicePortTypear.AsyncState     var result  server.EndWaitForEventar      Do stuff with result  codepre  pThe server must be multithreaded for this approach to work, and the number of clients should be limited so the server does not have a large number of threads hanging with blocking methods. In my case none of these issues are a problem  it is simple to setup a multithreaded server using gSOAP and there will only ever be one client which I control attached to each server. p  pAre there any significant disadvantages to this approach Can you suggest a better solutionp

Negative 7002 pIve noticed a pattern recently in our codebase at work, where most of our model class have a name such as User, and there is an inheriting type that has extra fields on it called UserEx.  Ive also noticed this in the C async CTP where they put the additional static methods for Task in a class called TaskEx due to technical restrictions, since they couldnt alter the existing library.  Talking to someone at work, I learned that Ex classes exist to optimize network transfers you can pull only the bare minimum if you need.  My question, then, is what does Ex stand for  The only thing I can think of is possibly Extra. p

Negative 7002 pIn a dynamically compiled ASP.NET Website project, can the assembly for the AppCode folder be explicitly named p  pFor example, under regular circumstances when I run an ASP.NET website the assembly name generated into the codeTemporary ASP.NET Filescode folder is partially randomized like  codeAppCode.neizakfo.dllcode where emneizakfoem is the portion that can differ. Can I explicitly provide a name for the assembly like codeAppCodeWeb1.dllcode p  pstrongClarificationstrong   p  pBy business requirements, the website cannot be precompileddeployed. Therefore Im seeking a solution in context of the codeTemporary ASP.NET Filescode folder and dynamically compiled assemblies as noted above. p  hr  pemBackgroundembr I came across this question while looking for a way to perform dynamic type instantiation on a class in the AppCode folder of a website using an assemblyqualified name stored in configuration, but instantiated from the web page, thus crossing an assembly boundary. Because the web page and appcode code are compiled into two different assemblies by default, the Type.GetType.. methods default behaviour of searching for the Type name either in the current executing assembly the web page or in mscorlib doesnt suffice for picking any Type from the AppCode assembly. Being randomized, the appcode assembly name is not known for me to include in the assemblyqualified string.  p  pI can put the data Type in a class library because that does have an predefinedexact name to get rid of this problem, however Id like to know how to do this inside the website itself without creating a class library project for the purpose. p

Negative 7002 pI know some languages emphasise words differently to English, e.g. via changing word endings rather than stressing words with inflection of the voice. p  pIf you are localising a site, would you trust that codeltstronggtcode and codeltemgtcode tags and their placement will have the same meaning in other languages  would you maintain this emphasis, check with your translator or leave them outp  pWhat Im wondering is how this translates excuse the pun into the semantics of the web  Strong and em tags carry semantic meaning that is used within SEO, screenreaders etc. So should they be left in place so this isnt lost, or dropped to better conform with the target languagep

Negative 7002 pI am trying to implement fireworks with point sprites and then drawing trails by rendering the fireworks to two different textures, and then drawing them back to each other every second time with alpha set to lt 1, making each previous draw fade away more and more.p  pIt looks nice and depending on what alpha I use when drawing the previously rendered texture the trails gets longer or shorter, as expected. However, on most devices not all the trails never disappear completely. They leave a very transparent but still noticable trail after they should have faded away.p  pThis is what I do currentlyp  pdepending on a boolean called second I set the framebuffer to render to one of two textures called buff1 and buff2.p  precodeGL11ExtensionPackgl.glBindFramebufferOESGL11ExtensionPack.GLFRAMEBUFFEROES, myFBO.get0 if second     GL11ExtensionPackgl.glFramebufferTexture2DOESGL11ExtensionPack.GLFRAMEBUFFEROES, GL11ExtensionPack.GLCOLORATTACHMENT0OES, GL10.GLTEXTURE2D, buff2.texture.textureId, 0  else      GL11ExtensionPackgl.glFramebufferTexture2DOESGL11ExtensionPack.GLFRAMEBUFFEROES, GL11ExtensionPack.GLCOLORATTACHMENT0OES, GL10.GLTEXTURE2D, buff1.texture.textureId, 0  gl.glViewport0, 0, bufferSize, bufferSize gl.glClearColor0, 0, 0, 0 gl.glClearGL10.GLCOLORBUFFERBIT  GL10.GLDEPTHBUFFERBIT gl.glBlendFuncGL10.GLONE, GL10.GLONEMINUSSRCALPHA codepre  pThen I render the previously drawn texture on the current one, using a alpha value lt 1. The buff object is just a helper drawing a quad with a texture. The draw function premultiplies the alpha to the other color channels.p  precode a  alpha, higher value  longer trails  more distinct leftovers if second     buff1.setColor1, 1, 1, a     buff1.drawgl     second  false else      buff2.setColor1, 1, 1, a     buff2.drawgl     second  true  codepre  pAfter that I do the drawing of the point sprite fireworks. Also using premultiplied alpha and gl.glBlendFuncGL10.GLONE, GL10.GLONEMINUSSRCALPHAp  pFinally I reset the frame buffer and have my new texture containing the old trails fading and the current fireworks on top drawn at 100 alpha. I then use this texture to draw to my scene together with all the other objects behind and in front of the fireworks texture.p  pAs I said, almost everything is working, except for those almost transparent trails staying after the trails should have faded. The higher the alpha value drawing the previous buffer the more noticable the trail leftovers that stay forever.p  pI have been trying with different blending modes, premultiplied and not premultiplied alpha etc. But since this is an android opengl es 1.1 I think the blending should be GLONE and GLONEMINUSSRCALPHA since all bitmaps are premultiplied by default.p  pWhat am I doing wrong Is there a better way to do thisp  pThanks for any help, Andersp

Negative 7002 pIve been trying to get the PHPUnit mock objects working for some legacy code Im working on, but Im having issues getting it to sub in for the object Im after and Im pretty sure it must be because Im using it wrong. p  pCurrently we have a class which is used purely for creating queries, when another class wants to make a query it creates an object of this class and passes it the sql and database details. What I want to do is have PHPUnit replace this object with a mock version which I can test.p  pWhat Ive been finding though is, if I create the mock object in the test script, the method being tested just bypasses it. Im guessing this is because the method is creating and then using the object locally rather than it being passed as a parameter in which case I could just reference the method with the mock object passed as a parameter. Below is an example of what the code might look likep  precodeclass SampleClass     function loadData         sql  SELECT  FROM users         query  new Query         querygtquerysql         whilerow  querygtgetrow             ifrow[email]                   thisgterrors[]  Email missing from user .row[userid]                          result[]  querygtgetrow                  thisgtusers  result         ifcountusergterrors gt 1             return usergterrors         else             return true                 class Query     function querysql         thisgtresult  mysqlquerysql          function getrow         return mysqlfetchassocthisgtresult       codepre  pIs there a way to create a mock object in the PHPUnit test file which will replace the query object in SampleClass with a mock object which I can use to test the parameters being passed to and control the response of I wont be able to replace the query class or change how its referenced, as its used extensively throughout our application, but I would like to at least be able to create some form of test framework for it. Would appreciate any help you can givep  pEdited to clarify that theres more than just the query happening in the loadData method, which is the part of the method Im trying to test. Im hoping to sub in a double of the query class method getrow which will return a preset array of sample data for the method to work with rather than it hitting an actual databasep

Negative 7002 pI make an online HTML5 game, like blobby volley two jellys are playing volleyball. I have a websocket server on php. The game is running with 50 fps. Here is an example of how it works I push right arrow button, my client sets codemoveForwardcode flag to codetruecode and sends the message to the server. The server transfers the message to the other client, this client handles it. When a client handles codekeyupcode it does the same thing, but sets codemoveForwardcode flag to codefalsecode.  The problem is it takes server some time to transfer the message to the client, so when the keyup event triggers, the jelly stops immediately on one client but is still moving on the other one, and stops within a second. Any ways to make it more synchronousp
Negative 7002 pI would like the admins to control default values, and determine whether an input field is defaulted  can be writtenseen by users.p  pA couple of ideas I had were top  ul liInclude one default record that the admins can update, and then grab the values every time a user creates a new entry. In this scenario Im not sure how to control readonlyview. li liCreate a structure that uses field objects, and in the field, include bools for readonlyviewable, and a field for the actual field type and default. The downside is that the table that holds the users entries would be a subset of this set of objects. Also I am not sure how complex this structure is going to end up being, with regard to clientserver validations, etc.li ul  pIf it matters, we are using ASP.net MVC3, with CodeFirst Entity Framework 4.1. Another idea was to change the annotations at runtime, which seems complicated and maybe hard to maintaineasy to screw up.p
Negative 7002 pSo I was going about implementing AES encryption of data on an iPhone app, when I was puzzled by how to store the encryption key. I can easily enough encrypt data using a userentered password, the encryption key. However, if I store the key unencrypted, the encryption is useless as anyone with access could easily enough decrypt the data with the readilyavailable encryption key. I could encrypt the key, but then there would be another unencrypted key floating around and someone could just follow the chain down to the data. It seemed clear that I could not store the key, so I thought that I could have the key be only in the users mind. It would be very secure, but I would have no way to check if the decryption worked correctly and all data would be lost in the event that the user forgot their password, which is unacceptable. p  pEssentially, how can I securely store an encryption key for AESp  pIm sure this situation has been encountered before, as other questions have shown, but they seemed webfocused. I am interested in an iPhonecentric solution, potentially using CommonCryptop

Negative 7002 pim currently working on a multiple class assignment where i have to add a course based on whether the prerequisites exist within the program. im storing my courses within the program class using a hashmap. thought i would come in handy however, im having a bit of trouble ensuring that these preReqs exist. here is some code ive currently got goingp  precodepublic boolean checkForCourseFeasiblityAbstractCourse c throws ProgramException         AbstractCourse[] tempArray  new AbstractCourse[0]       tempArray    courses.keySet.toArraytempArray       String[] preReqsArray  new String[1]     preReqsArray  c.getPreReqs     gets all course values and stores them in tempArray       forint i  0 i lt preReqsArray.length i               ifcourses.containsKeypreReqsArray[i]                       continue                  else if courses.containsKeypreReqsArray[i]                      throw new ProgramExceptionpreReqs do not exist                       return true  codepre  pok so basically, tempArray is storing all the keySets inside the courses hashmap and i need to compare all of them with the preReqs which is an array of Strings. if the preReqs exist within the keyset then add the course, if they dont do not add the course. return true if the course adds otherwise through me an exception. keep in mind my keysets are Strings e.g. a keyset value could be Programming1 and the required prerquisite for a course could be programming1. if this is the case add then add the course as the prereq course exists in the keyset. i believe my error to be when i initialize mypreReqsArray with c.getPreReqs note getPreReqs is a getter with a return type String[]. it would be really great if someone could aid me with my dilemma. ive tried to provide as much as possible, i feel like ive been going around in circles for the past 3 hours  Thank you.p

Negative 7002 pIm having issues understanding how to simulate a situation like this a hrefhttpphet.colorado.edusimsdensityandbuoyancybuoyancyen.html relnofollowhttpphet.colorado.edusimsdensityandbuoyancybuoyancyen.htmlap  pThe point of the program is to make a simulator  like the one in the link. I want to keep it realistic and use Python. I want to draw the simulation in a hrefhttppygame.org relnofollow titlePygame websitePygamea.p  pIn my program I ask for a couple of variables the mass and the radius. The radius will be used to calculate the volume of a sphere and the mass will be used to calculate the buoyancy, gravity force and acceleration. p  pBut the thing is, to keep everything in SIunits I ask for the radius in metre. Doing this while keeping my radius under 10cm, makes for a really small number. And when I use the Pygame module to draw a sphere at the size of 0.1m, it fails. So instead of doing that, I needed to use a bigger scale.p  pSo here comes my main problem. How exacly should I scale the sphere Say I wanted to define 100 pixels to be 1 metre. I would then have to multiply my radius by 100, since that would be the scale, but now that the sphere is bigger should the velocity also be multiplied by 100p  pIve gotten really confused over this Thanks for your time.p  pDont know if you need to see this, anyhow.br Calculations.pyp  precodeimport math  class Formulas     def initself         self.pi  3.1415926535         self.gravity  9.82 ms2         self.densitywater  1000.0 kgm3         self.densityair    1.29 kgm3         self.dragsphere    0.47      def objectbuoyancyself, volume, mediumdensity         buoyancy  volume  mediumdensity  self.gravity N         return buoyancy      def objectgravityself, mass         gravityforce  mass  self.gravity N         return gravityforce      def objectvolumesphereself, radius         volume   1.3333333  self.pi  math.powradius, 3 m3         return volume      def objectmassself, density, volume         mass  volume  density kg         return mass      def objectaccelerationself, gravityforce, buoyancy, mass         totalforce  gravityforce  buoyancy N         acceleration  totalforce  mass ms2         return acceleration      def objectspeedself, acceleration, time, scale         speed   acceleration  floattime1000.0 ms         return speed      def surfaceareaself, radius         area  4  self.pi  math.powradius, 2         return area codepre

Negative 7002 pI recently came across a hrefhttpwww.scribd.comdoc1094538582SpotifyCodequest2012 relnofollowthis Edit Problem Aa interesting problem from Spotifys hacker challenge earlier this year which involves determining the switching at train truck junctions to route a train back to its starting point. The train must arrive facing the same direction it left and the train can never reverse on the tracks.p  pAs I understand it, the problem can be modeled as an undirected graph where we must find the shortest cycle from a certain vertex, or detect that no such cycle exists. However, the interesting part is that for a vertex, v, the vertices adjacent to v are dependent on the path taken to v, so in a sense the graph could be considered directed, though this direction is pathdependent.p  pMy first thought was to model each node as 3 separate vertices, A, B and C, where A lt B and A lt C, and then use a breadthfirst search to build a search tree until we find the original vertex, but this is complicated by the caveat above, namely that the adjacencies for a given vertex depend on the previous vertex we visited. This means that in our BFS tree, nodes can have multiple parents.p  pObviously a simple BFS search wont be sufficient to solve this problem. I know there are algorithms that exist to detect cycles in a graph. One approach might be to detect all the cycles, then for each cycle, detect whether the path is valid. i.e., does not reverse direction p  pDoes anyone else have any insights on approaches to solving this problemp  pstrongUPDATEstrong I followed the approach suggested by Karussell in the comments. p  pa hrefhttpsgithub.comastahlmanspotifyrailwayproblemspotifyrailwayproblem relnofollowHere is my solution on github.a p  pThe trick was to model the situation using an edgebased graph, not a traditional vertexbased graph. The input file supplied in the contest is conveniently specified in terms of edges already, so this file can be easily used to build an edgebased graph.p  pThe program uses two important classes Road and Solver. A Road has two integer fields, j1 and j2. j1 represents the source junction and j2 represents the target junction. Each road is oneway, meaning that you can only travel from j1 to j2. Each Road also includes a LinkedList of adjacent Roads and a parent Road. The Road class also includes static methods to convert between the Strings used in the input file and integer indexes representing the A, B, and C points at each junction.p  pFor each entry in the input file, we add two Roads to a HashMap, one Road for each direction between the two junctions. We now have a list of all of the Roads that run between junctions. We just need to connect the roads together at the junctions through the A, B and C switches. If a Road ends at Junction.A, we look up the roads that begin at Junction.B and Junction.C and add these roads as adjacencies. The buildGraph function returns the Road whose target junction j2 is 1A  index 0.p  pAt this point, our graph is constructed. To find the shortest path I simply used a BFS to traverse the graph. We leave the root unmarked and begin by queueing the roots adjacencies. If we find a road whose target junction is 1A index 0 then we have found the shortest cycle through the starting point. Once we reconstruct the path using each Roads parent property, its a trivial matter to set the switches appropriately as required in the problem.p  pThanks to Karussell for suggesting this approach. If you want to put your comment in answer form with a short explanation, I will accept it. Thanks to Origin, as well. I must admit that I did not fully follow the logic of your answer, but that is certainly not to say that it is not correct. If anyone solves this problem using your solution, I would be very interested to see it.p

Negative 7002 pI know I can use includemerge to include an XML file in another XML file.  If the included layout contains children and you include several instances of this in the root view, how do you find the ID of each child instancep  pFor example if the included layout contains a listview, and you include 3 instances of this layout in the root layout, how do you find and reference the 3 listview childrenp  pUPDATE For folks reading this thread  There is actually a much better solution that I have found, and in retrospect its quite obvious.  The problem with getChildAt is that if you add new views or rearrange things, this code will either crash or not work since the index of the children has changed, and the class types may not even match anymore.  So not very maintainable.  It turns out that findViewById works fine if you just drill down a bit further into the layout and if you give each of the includes an ID.  So for example, suppose you have 3 includes in a layout, with ID names listcontainer1, listcontainer2 and listcontainer3.  Each of these includes the same list view XML with the same ID name.  Now instead of trying to find your lists from the root layout, which wont work, find the containers first, then find the lists like thisp  precodemyRootLayout  LinearLayout findViewByIdR.id.rootlayout container1  LinearLayout myRootLayout.findViewByIdR.id.listcontainer1 list1  ListView container1.findViewByIdR.id.mylistview container2  LinearLayout myRootLayout.findViewByIdR.id.listcontainer2 list2  ListView container2.findViewByIdR.id.mylistview container3  LinearLayout myRootLayout.findViewByIdR.id.listcontainer3 list3  ListView container3.findViewByIdR.id.mylistview codepre  pIn the above example, the layout hiearchy is like this and could be further simplifiedp  precodeLinearLayout     ltincludegt         LinearLayout             ListView     ltincludegt         LinearLayout             ListView     ltincludegt         LinearLayout             ListView codepre

Negative 7002 pstrongIs it possible to change the Period of a repeating timer in TimerFcnstrong p  pIntuitively, when programming for Windows, I would handle WMTIMER messages and use SetTimer to edit the period of a timer, but a similar approach doesnt seem to work in MATLAB, because the timer needs to be restarted in order to change the Period property. This messes up execution, which can be best described as changing the period to nearzero. No errors are produced.p  pHeres some example code thats used to create a task array each task item consists of something to do and a delay. The array is basically walked by a timer, which should change its Period based on the current task delay.p  precodefunction obj  Scheduler     obj.scheduletimer  timer...

Negative 7002 pIm having a lot of trouble figuring out how to automatically create an instance of a model for a ForeignKey field when a form is submitted. Heres a simple toy website that illustrates the problemp  pI have two models, Model1 and Model2. Model2 contains a ForeignKey to Model1. I want the user to be able to create an instance of Model2 by either specifically selecting an instance of Model1 to store in the ForeignKey, or by leaving that value blank and letting an instance of Model1 be automatically generated.p  pHeres what I feel like that code should look like. My models.py code is very straightforwardp  precode models.py from django.db import models from django.core.validators import MinValueValidator   class Model1models.Model       Note this field cannot be negative     myfield1  models.IntegerFieldvalidators[MinValueValidator0]   class Model2models.Model      blank  True will make keytomodel1 not required on the form,      but since null  False, I will still require the ForeignKey      to be set in the database.     relatedmodel1  models.ForeignKeyModel1, blankTrue       Note this field cannot be negative     myfield2  models.IntegerFieldvalidators[MinValueValidator0] codepre  pforms.py is a bit involved, but whats going on is quite straightforward. If Model2Form does not receive an instance of Model1, it tries to automatically create one in the clean method, validates it, and if its valid, it saves it.

Negative 7002 pI am using glade to make my .ui files and then using codeGtkBuildercode I am loading that whole .ui file in my C program, so all the widgets and stuff are created from the builder files itself. p  pEarlier I had been creating widgets only from the code itself, hence allowing me to pass any type of data to the Callback since the second argument is a codegpointercode variable and I could anytime create a pointer to a custom made structure and pass any type of data to the callbacks.p  pBut now to connect to the signals I am just using this simple function p  precodegtkbuilderconnectsignalsbuilder, NULL codepre  pwhere codebuildercode is a pointer to codeGtkBuildercode. p  pThis connects all the signals mentioned in glade file with those of function defined in the .c files without having any provision of passing userdata other than that of Widgets which themselves can only be defined in glade.p  pCan anybody tell me a solution so that I can pass any type of data to my callbacks.

Negative 7002 pI am returning an object that contains nested models via breeze. Let me take the canonical sample. Customers and Orders. I am using EF5 on the server. Using Breeze, I am calling my controller to get all customers and am also including the .expand attribute in the breeze query call to include the Orders entity also. The json comes back perfectly and I am using the kendo.breeze.datasource built by Derick Bailey to map breeze entity to knockout observables [using ko.mapping] and then eventually bind to kendo grid. This works perfectly until we want to return nested types. For ex, I want to bind, order.Orderid to an element.  so, when I try to pass the data to kendo datasource to bind to grid, I get a Stack overflow exception. This scenario was handled for entityAspect and entityType recursion by the kendo.breeze.datasource module but obviously it cannot handle custom nested types. I tried to ignore the property orders.customer in ko.mapping.toJs to prevent order referencing back to customer but thats not ignoring properties at the child level. Of course, if I ignore orders completely, the binding works but I cant access order.Orderid in the grid. help plsp

Negative 7002 pI have a question but Im pretty sure the answer is no, so Im open to ideas to solve my problem.p  pThe problem I have a program with two versions of code, an online liveproduction version and a local developmenttest version. Its a Java Web Start Swing Desktop app. I have setup an error logging system that sends me an email with the stack trace of the error. But, since the local devtest version is always different from the live version, I have to look at the code that is on the live version to get to the exact line of the error. So, Ive setup an SVN which I commit to whenever I update the live program.p  pId like to, in the error email, link directly to the line of that threw the error so that I can just click the link in the stack trace. The stack trace tells me the file  line number. I can access my SVN repository through http, so I can view the code as a textonly no HTML page. But I cannot put anchors in these code pages codelta namegtcode. The code pages are textonly, no HTML otherwise Id just put an anchor on every line with the line.p  pThe question is this Is there any way to jump to line  in a textonly noHTML page If I link to the right code file, is there a way I can also jump to a line in that file without codelta namegtcode p  pIf anyone knows of any good SVN viewer web apps that can plug into my existing SVN that would be welcome to. Hopefully I was clear enough presenting the problem so that it makes sense. Ive googled around but I cant find anything. Any solutions you guys may have would be helpful.p  pThanks.p

Negative 7002 pI wrote a php script that basically fetches RSS feeds and stores them in a database.

Negative 7002 pI have a opencl kernel that does some warping on an images. This is a forward mapping and each kernel instance handles the mappingwarpping of one pixel in the source image. This means that some kernel instances pixels in the source image map to the same destination pixel.

Negative 7002 pI searched the internet for a while now, but cant find any hints on how to do this.p  pI wrote my own component in joomla 2.5 and it works fine so far. Part of the component is a form in the backend.

But I need this part of the form various times repeated like a table.p  precode    ltinput namealpha1 ....gt     ltinput namebeta1 ....gt     ltinput namegamma1 ....gt      ltinput namealpha2 ....gt     ltinput namebeta2 ....gt     ltinput namegamma2 ....gt      ltinput namealpha3 ....gt     ltinput namebeta3 ....gt     ltinput namegamma3 ....gt      ... codepre  pI cant imagine, it would be smart to have like 100 sets of fields in the xml file, and then use only some of them. So my next approach was two create my own costum field, which extends a standard field and add another parameter like an index which would be used to alter the name tag of the input field. I guess that wouldnt work, since I dont call the getIndex method of the field class but of the jform class and there are only 3 parameters.p  pSo I couldnt figure out how to do this with jforms. I now have kinda solution by just using php  to get the html structure, but I would prefer to do it with jforms, so I could use the standard and custom from fields.p  pI appriciate any help on this and Im still a newbie, so if this is the wrong approach, please let me know. p  pThanksp

Negative 7002 pI am developing an API for using hdfs as a distributed file storage. I have made a REST api for allowing a server to mkdir, ls, create and delete a file in the HDFS cluster using Webhdfs. But since Webhdfs does not support downloading a file, are there any solutions for achieving this. I mean I have a server who runs my REST api and communicates with the cluster. I know the OPEN operation just supports reading a text file content, but suppose I have a file which is 300 MB in size, how can I download it from the hdfs cluster. Do you guys have any possible solutions. I was thinking of directly pinging the datanodes for a file, but this solution is flawed as if the file is 300 MB in size, it will put a huge load on my proxy server, so is there a streaming API to achieve this.p

Negative 7002 pIm currently very stuck with this, my designer wants to have our app with WindowStyle.None to remove the borders and default ugly controls, he has then add custom controls, usually to allow dragging in the past we have used a rectangle and monitored the mousedown event to allow for dragmove.p  pHowever with Caliburn micro we lose control of the window because windowmanager create this for us, Im aware you can override the create window method, but this still doesnt give access to adding UI elements to the window itself and binding to those events.

Negative 7002 pI am considering using random forest for a classification problem. The data comes in sequences. I plan to use first N500 to train the classifier. Then, use the classifier to classify the data after that. It will make mistakes and the mistakes sometimes can be recorded. p  pMy question is can I use those misclassified data to retrain the original classifier and how If I simply add the misclassified ones to original training set with size N, then the importance of the misclassified ones will be exaggerated as the corrected classified ones are ignored. Do I have to retrain the classifier using all data What other classifiers can do this kind of learningp

Negative 7002 pAs of right now, I am working on a mock up OS via WinForms to use as a prop for movies. Upon running the application, it kills explorer.exe so that you cant accidentally have the windows task bar show up during a shoot. The issue is, upon closing the mock OS I would like for explorer.exe to be started up again. However, codeProcess.Startexplorer.execode brings up an explorer window, and does not reinstate the window taskbar.p  pI know for a fact, that task manager is more than capable of bringing back the window taskbar via typing explorer.exe under a new task, though Ive had no luck finding command line arguments to pass to task manager.p  pstrongEditstrong Im running under Windows 7. As well, Im going pretty in depth with this mock OS. Im taking control of quite a few key presses that Windows uses. For this reason, I kill explorer.exe so that I can use key presses such as AltTab and display a mock app switcher, etc. The app already runs in full screen, but it is still possible to have the underlying Windows GUI pop back up. I am essentially replacing explorer.exe with my own mock up explorer. Upon closing my custom explorer, I cant seem to get the regular Windows GUI to come back by launching explorer.exe via codeProcess.Startcode.p

Negative 7002 pWhen the touchscreen is tapped once, the finger touches multiple x,y positions on the screen by virtue of the finger being fat. But android only gives me one x,y position at a time For example, if I use adb shell getevent, it gives me only one xy coordinate at a time. Of course for a tap it gives multiple x,y positions since the tap lasts for some time and it gives the xy position for each fraction of that time if xy slightly changes. At each instant there are more than 50100 pixels that I am touching  presumably android uses some algorithm to reduce all the touch signals into one xy position. Is there a way I can get those multiple raw touch signals at every pixel I am touching at the same time I have a rooted device and am willing to delve into android source code if required.p

Negative 7002 pProbably a pretty fundamental question. When developing a singleprojectsolution in MSVC everything makes a lot of sense, every file is visible to the compiler. When moving to a multiple project solution, none of the interface elements governing project dependence seem to make sense coming from a .net background.p  pFor starters it appears setting up project dependencies with that terminology seems to only imply what order the projects are compiled in. There is no more function attached to the definition and addressing objects or methods of one project from another will not work. including the headers of the dependency doesnt seem to work either, so the dependent project cannot see the files of its dependency. Copying a link of a header from one project to another doesnt work either, where for two projects under the Header Files section, the same file is referenced in both locations. Even with this header references do not work and the files are unconnected. The only way of creating a functional dependency is to add the dependencys paths to the linkercompiler search path of the dependent or worse, simply copying the files of one project to another.p  pEither Im missing something or the .NET Visual Studio IDEs have succeeded at what the VC IDE has badly failed at.p  pstrongEditstrongp  pFor the sake of asking a specific question, take the following steps for creating a solution in VC and I ask if the missing steps can be filled inp  ol liCreate empty DLL project inside new solution.li liCreate method in DLL project and compile.li liCreate new empty executable project.li liCreate main method in new project.li li...li liHave main method call function in DLL project.li ol  pPreferably fill in the missing steps with the most most modernindustry standardbest practice method that best maintains project modularity as intended.p  pFrom this I would expect to independently be able to extrapolate and create classes, enumerations etc. in the DLL class and access them all in the executable project, so long as I can find out how this is intended to be done.p

Negative 7002 pIm writing a GUI application to displaygraph a series of graphs.  When the application starts up it automatically reads the raw data from a specified location and automatically graphs and display them.

I have a menu item to do the save and it works without problem since the application has already been displayed on screen in order to get to the menu.  Now that Im adding an automatic save capability I need to be able to trigger this save action only AFTER the form has been fully displayed on screen.p  pIm currently putting in a timer in the forms Load event that goes off in N seconds, which trigger the save action.  But for some reason it doesnt work, probably because the timer is in a different thread than the GUI thread which means the timer thread cannot access the GUI elements.p  pIs there a better way to do this simple task without resorting to overly complicated approaches like background workerp

So far Ive not had any major problems and so far have no had a need to consider any external libraries for integration such as the angular js  jquery mobile adapter. Ive created a multipage app currently only two pages and used separate controllers for each page login  content page. The app itself is simple, its just a list keeping app and ive created a quick jsfiddle based on the ui aspect of the content page a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netG7JNV4 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netG7JNV4ap  pThe app works as expected from the jsfiddle. However because the content page is a page in the same html document index.html as the login page, to navigate to the content page the url becomes p  pcode...index.htmlmainpagecode p  pmainpage being the page for the list keeperp  pThats when things start getting funny. When the url is like above, when adding an item to the list, the item is initially unstyled it doesnt look like its part of the list but the css styling for that item comes back after adding another item. Of course the next item is then unstyled and so on. p  pIf you want to see what the issue looks likep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comfG4gK.png altenter image description herep  pEverything however works fine if i dont have the hash page as part of the URL I tested this by turning the two page app into just one page for the content so that code...index.htmlcode goes straight to the content page. The css is applied to the dynamic content fine as one would expect.p  pOf course I have no idea why its doing this and I suspect that its something to do with how angular and jqm treat the hash anchor in the URL but bare in mind I dont have much experience in both Angular JS nor jQuery Mobile.p  pAny help from any of the more experienced Angular JS and jQuery Mobile users would be greatly appreciatedp

Negative 7002 pIm teaching a statistics class where Im having students explore questions in probability and statistics through simulation using R.  Recently there was some confusion about the probability of getting exactly two 6s when rolling 5 dice.  The answer is choose5,25365, but some students were convinced that order shouldnt matter i.e. that the answer should be choose5,2choose25,3choose30,5.  I thought it would be fun to have them simulate rolling 5 dice thousands of times, keeping track of the empirical probability for each experiment, and then repeat the experiment many times.  The problem is the two numbers above are sufficiently close that its quite hard to get a simulation to tease out the difference in a statistically significant fashion of course I could just be doing it wrong.  I tried rolling 5 dice 100000 times, then repeating the experiment 10000 times.  This took an hour or so to run on my i7 linux machine and still allowed for a 25 chance that the correct answer is choose5,2choose25,3choose30,5.  So I increased the number of dice rolls per experiment to 106.  Now the code has been running for over 2 days and shows no sign of finishing.  Im confused by this, as I only increased the number of operations by an order of magnitude, implying that the run time should be closer to 10 hours.p  pSecond question  Is there a better way to do this  See code posted belowp  precodeprobdist  rep0,10000  for j in 1lengthprobdist     outcome  rep0,1000000    for k in 11000000           rolls  sample16, 5, replaceT       if lengthrolls[rolls  6]  2 outcome[k]  1         probdist[j]  sumoutcomelengthoutcome  codepre
Negative 7002 pIm trying to make a code which simulates the functionality of a graphic editor. The user has to type an instruction, which is a character, followed by the parameters that each action will have.p  pThe maximum size of the image is 250, so I created a vector of 250 chars on the top of the scope. My strategy was to, in the case of coloring a pixel, I could just chose the coordinates of this vector and the color I wanted which is also represented as a char and assign them equally. p  pAt first, the code seems ok.

Negative 7002 pIm witnessing some very weird behaviour I think might be related to this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions17643548extendingtextselectioncontextualactionbarinandroidquestiona. p  pMy basic layout is a ListView with 1 header that contains a selectable TextView. When the entire ListView headeritems fits in less than the screen and I select text in the selectable TextView, everything works like youd expect the Contextual Actionbar appears, the word I longpressed is highlighted, the selectiontrianglesliders appear.p  pMy problem is when the ListView does NOT fit in the screen, selecting text in the selectable TextView causes the Contextual Actionbar to appear and immediately disappear, leaving the word I longpressed highlighted but with the selectiontrianglesliders gone, my ListView slightly scrolled down, and the app in some weird state that I need to press Back to get out of. p  pMy questions are p  p1 Am I correct in assuming that the autoscrolling of my ListView is causing a loss of focus of my selectable TextView and destroying the Contextual Actionbar or is there something else going on p  p2 More importantly, how can I fix thisp  pThanksp

Negative 7002 pI am making a chrome extension that adds html elements into the users page content when the page loads. The styles of the elements that the extension inserts are specified in the extensions css. This mostly works fine.p  pThe problem Sometimes I will have styling issues with the elements for my extension because the site that the user visits has a style sheet which has styles such as code ... code or codeimg ... code, and the styles are applied to my extensions elements.p  pI want to find a way to ensure that the html elements that my chrome extension inserts into a websites page content are only affected by my css, and are not affected by the css of the sites that a user visits. One way that Ive accomplished this is my giving most of my html elements types such as codeltmyExtensionDivgtcode instead of codeltdivgtcode. However, this doesnt work in cases where the website uses code ... code and I cant avoid using codeltimggtcode elements in my extensions html, so they are often affected.p

Negative 7002 pI ran into a slight problem. Im trying to make a column graph like this one using highcharts a hrefhttpwww.highcharts.comdemocolumnbasic relnofollowhttpwww.highcharts.comdemocolumnbasicap  pThe individual series are spring, summer, fall and winter and as categories I use various varibales such as air humidity, pressure etc. Now the problem is that I wanted to use multiple yaxes, because obviously humidity for example ranges between 0 and 100, pressure is around 1000 and they have different units as well. In the documentation I found that it is possible to set multiple axes but the problem is that it only shows how to specifiy axis for each series. In this case however, I obviously do not want separate axes for series humidity is similiar in spring, summer etc., but I want different axes for the individual categories. Does anyone know it this is possible and if howp

Negative 7002 pI am having trouble using the UnivariateFunctionDifferentiator interface in java. p  pQuoted from the Commons Homepagep  pemThere are several ways a user can create an implementation of the UnivariateDifferentiableFunction interface. The first method is to simply write it directly using the appropriate methods from DerivativeStructure to compute addition, subtraction, sine, cosine... This is often quite straigthforward and there is no need to remember the rules for differentiation the user code only represent the function itself, the differentials will be computed automatically under the hood. strongThe second method is to write a classical UnivariateFunction and to pass it to an existing implementation of the UnivariateFunctionDifferentiator interface to retrieve a differentiated version of the same function.strong The first method is more suited to small functions for which user already control all the underlying code. The second method is more suited to either large functions that would be cumbersome to write using the DerivativeStructure API, or functions for which user does not have control to the full underlying code for example functions that call external libraries.emp  pNow, my issue is simple. The first metod described above is very simple to implement yet not suitable for my situation. The reason is twofold. First, I have a very big function about 40 elements and, second, I already spend a couple of hours calculating the derivative. Hence, I am interested in using the UnivariateFunctionDifferentiator interface. p  pHowever, I cant come across any example or way to implement my univariate function f and its derivative using this UnivariateFunctionDifferentiator interface. It seems confusing to me exactly how to use this interface. My overall target is to use the newtonraphson method to solve fx  0.p  pDoes anyone have any experience in implenting this that could help me out Thanks in advance for your help and please let me know if anything is not clarified enoughp

Negative 7002 pI have a script that does things for me, but very inefficiently. I asked for some help on code reviewers, and was told to try Pandas instead. This is what Ive done, but Im having some difficulty understand how it works. Ive tried to read the documentation and other questions here, but I cant find any answer.p  pSo, Ive got a dataframe with a small amount of rows 20 to couple of hundred and a smaller number of columns. Ive used the readtable pandas function to get at the original data in .txt form, which looks like thisp  precode[ID1, Gene1, Sequence1, Ratio1, Ratio2, Ratio3] [ID1, Gene1, Sequence2, Ratio1, Ratio2, Ratio3] [ID2, Gene2, Sequence3, Ratio1, Ratio2, Ratio3] [ID2, Gene3, Sequence4, Ratio1, Ratio2, Ratio3] [ID3, Gene3, Sequence5, Ratio1, Ratio2, Ratio3] codepre  p... along with a whole bunch of unimportant columns.p  pWhat I want to be able to do is to select all the ratios from each Sequence and perform some calculations and statistics on them all 3 ratios for each sequence, that is. Ive triedp  precodedf.groupbySequence for col in df     do something  printcol  printcol[0] codepre  p... but that only makes me more confused. If I pass printcol, I get some kind of df construct printed, whereas if I pass printcol[0], I only get the sequences. As far as I can see in the construct, I should still have all the other columns and their data, since groupby doesnt remove any data, it just groups it by some input column. What am I doing wrongp  pAlthough I havent gotten that far yet, due to the problems above, I also want my script to be able to select all the ratios for every ID and perform the same calculations on them, but this time every ratio by itself i.e. Ratio1 for all rows of ID1, the same for Ratio2, etc.. And, lastly, do the same thing for every gene.p  pEDITp  pSo, say I want to perform this calculation on every ratio in the row, and then take the median of the three resulting valuesp  precodedf[Value1]  spike[data[ID]]  floatdata[Ratio 1]  1012  6.0221023  1106 df[Value2]  spike[data[ID]]  floatdata[Ratio 2]  1012  6.0221023  1106 df[Value3]  spike[data[ID]]  floatdata[Ratio 3]  1012  6.0221023  1106 codepre  p... where spike is a dictionary, and the keys are the IDs. Ignoring the dict part, I can make calculations thanks, but how do I access the dictionary using the dataframe IDs With the above code, I just get a Unhashable type Series error.p  pHeres some real datap  precodeID  Gene    Sequence    Ratio1  Ratio2  Ratio3 1   KRAS    SFEDXXYR    15.822  14.119  14.488 2   KRAS    VEDAXXXLVR  9.8455  8.9279  16.911 3   ELK4    IEXXXCESLNK 15.745  7.9122  9.5966 3   ELK4    IEGXXXSLNKR 1.177   NaN     12.073 codepre

Im guessing this means both segfaults come from the same location. 193000  0x2f1e8. I thought that 0x2f1e8 would lead to an instruction in the Python library assembly dump, but it didnt 0x2f1e8 is well out of range of the disassembly.p

Negative 7002 pI have a form that allows a user to add and delete objects from an array. The deleting process works by taking the array and dumping all the contents into a dropdown list the user can select what they want to delete from. p  precodeltphp sessionstart1  if issetSESSION[array] narray  SESSION[array] if narray  NULL echo DDDD   echo Select an object to delete  echo ltselect namedeleteobgt foreachnarray as drop         echoltoption value.drop.gt.drop.ltoptiongt       echo ltselectgt codepre  pWhenever all of the contents are deleted, the array does not clear Im not sure the word, it does not seem to be actually emptying. The echo DDDD is to see if the array has something contained inside of it. Ive also tried seeing if the array is NULL, but neither will echo anything, but the dropdown list is still being created with an empty selection. The array is being pulled from a process page by a session variable on another page. Basically array has nothing inside of it but acts like it does.

It NEEDS that FindTypeBid function to be called, TypeB is made up elsewhere in the program at a very specific moment which happens before I deserialize mind you so I do not believe that is the issue.

Negative 7002 pI have some data stored into a SQLite Database and a Python program that is supposed to retrieve them. The user inputs two dates e.g. 01012010  01012013 and the program should make some analysis on the data going from 01012010 to 01012013. The way the code is retrieving the data is the following p  precodecon  lite.connectdata.db cur  con.cursor  cur.executeSELECT ROWID from Table WHERE Date IS 01012010 rowDate1  cur.fetchall  cur.executeSELECT ROWID from Table WHERE Date IS 01012013 rowDate2  cur.fetchall codepre  pThe two variables coderowDate1code and coderowDate2code are the inferior and superior extremes to be used to execute the SQL statement that will give back the values to be used in the Python program. Basically, if I want to run my analysis for the period 01012010  01012013, the variables coderowDate1code and coderowDate2code will contain the row IDs to be used for the data retrieving. p  pSo, until a certain date, specifically 01012010, the variable coderowDate1code is giving back the rowID number with the following sample outputp  precoderowDate1  [6002,] codepre  pAfter 01012010, though, the return of the codecur.fetchallcode is empty coderowDate1  []code I have checked the data into the database and they exist, they have a rowID exactly like the others.  Moreover, if the data wouldnt exist, then even the variable coderowDate2code should return an empty value, which is not the case. In fact, if I would executep  precodecur.executeSELECT ROWID from Table WHERE Date IS 01012012 rowDate1  cur.fetchall rowDate2  cur.fetchall print rowDate1, rowDate2  codepre  pI would get the following outputp  precode[] [6002,] codepre  pI know, its absurde, but I really dont understand how this could happen. I fear this is a bug of the code and Ive really no clue. Does anyone have an idea of how can I move to detect it, what it could depend on p  pstrongNOTEstrong there is not really much more I can post about the remaining part of the code. Exactly the same statement works in the attribution of the variable coderowDate2code and not in the variable coderowDate1code I mean, if I input from the GUI the date frame 01012012  01012012, the variable coderowDate1code wont have a value while the variable coderowDate2code will.

Negative 7002 pI am making a CORS POST request and setting the ContentType header to json. This triggers a Preflight OPTIONS request to fire this is good and expectedp  pThis OPTIONS request is responded to with a 200 OK but this isnt coming from my WebAPI application. p  pI have a custom Message Handler in place and it never gets hit so the request is getting responded to by IIS prior to hitting ASP.NET it seems.p  pI have found several posts on the subject and they say the followingp  ol lipMake sure WebDav is uninstalled  removed  disabled  strongDONEstrongpli lipMake sure the OPTIONSVerbHandler is removed  changed to use aspnetisapi.dll  strongTRIED BOTHstrongpli lipMake sure the extensionlessURLHandler includes the OPTIONS verb  strongDONEstrongpli ol  pHowever, my options request is still getting hijacked. By that I mean, IIS responds with at 200 OK but isnt including an AccessControlAllowOrigin header in the response. It isnt including this header because it is never getting to my WebAPI CORS code that would set this header.p  pThe two best posts I could find that sound like my issue are p  phere a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions14897247jquerystuckatcorspreflightandiisghostresponseJQuery stuck at CORS preflight and IIS ghost responseap  pand here a hrefhttpbrockallen.com20121018corsiisandwebdavhttpbrockallen.com20121018corsiisandwebdavap  pI have tried turning on Failed Request tracing FERB in IIS and set it to trace all 200 status codes. I dont ever see the options request being logged... Not sure if this means FERB doesnt track OPTIONS requests or if I need to change something in the FERB settings to make it track OPTIONS requests, Or if this is a clue to what my problem is p  pThis is ASP.NET WebAPI 2.0 running on IIS 7.5 Also tested on IIS 8 and IISExpress with same results Doesnt matter what browser Chrome, FF, and IE all fail the same way p  pI have tried everything I can find on the subject and still cant fix my problem.p  pHelp me StackOverflow, youre my only hope.p

Negative 7002 pI have been working on the beginnings of an engine for educational pursuit and Ive run into an OpenGL concept which I THOUGHT I understood, however I cannot explain the behavior Ive been observing. The issue is with the Depth Buffer. Also, understand that I have fixed the issue, and at the end of my post I will explain what fixed the problem, however I do not understand bwhyb the problem was fixed through my solution. First I initialize GLUT amp GLEWp  precodeInitialize openGL glutInitampargc, argv Set display mode and window attributes glutInitDisplayModeGLUTDOUBLE  GLUTDEPTH  GLUTRGB  Size and position attributes can be found in constants.h glutInitWindowSizeWINDOWWIDTH, WINDOWHEIGHT glutInitWindowPositionWINDOWXPOS, WINDOWYPOS Create window glutCreateWindowGallagher   Initialize GLEW glewExperimental  true glewInit  Initialize Graphics program Initialize codepre  pThen I initialize my program Leaving segments out for readability and lack of relevancep  precodeRemove cursor glutSetCursorGLUTCURSORNONE  Enable depth buffering glEnableGLDEPTHTEST glDepthMaskGLTRUE glDepthFuncGLLESS glDepthRange0.0f, 1.0f  Set back color glClearColor0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0  Set scale and dimensions of orthographic viewport These values can be found in constants.h Program uses a right handed coordinate system. glOrthoXLEFT, XRIGHT, YDOWN, YUP, ZNEAR, ZFAR codepre  pAnything beyond that point just includes initializing various engine components, loading the .obj files, and initializing instances of a ModularGameObject class, attaching the meshes to them, nothing that touches any relevant glutglew. However, before I go on it may be important to specify the following valuesp  precodeXLEFT  1000 XRIGHT  1000 YDOWN  1000 YUP  1000 ZNEAR  0.1 ZFAR  1000 codepre  pWhich causes my viewport to follow a right handed coordinate system. The final segment of code which seems to be involved in the problem is my vertex shaderp  precodeversion 330 core Position of vertices in attribute 0 layoutlocation  0 in vec4 vertexPosition Vertex Normals in attribute 1 layoutlocation  1 in vec4 vertexNormal  Model transformations Uniform location of model transformation matrix uniform mat4 modelTransformation  Uniform location of camera transformations Camera transformation matrix uniform mat4 cameraTransformation Camera perspective matrix uniform mat4 cameraPerspective  Uniform location of inverse screen dimensions This is used because GLSL normalizes viewport from 1 to 1 So any vector representing a position in screen space must be multiplied by this vector before display uniform vec4 inverseScreenDimensions  Output variables Indicates whether a vertex is valid or not, non valid vertices will not be drawn. flat out int valid         0  valid vertex Normal to be sent to fragment shader smooth out vec4 normal  void main      Initiate transformation pipeline      Transform to world space     vec4 vertexInWorldSpace  vec4modelTransformation vertexPosition      Transform to camera space     vec4 vertexInCameraSpace  vec4cameraTransformation  vertexInWorldSpace      Project to screen space     vec4 vertexInScreenSpace  vec4cameraPerspective  vertexInCameraSpace      Transform to device coordinates and store     vec4 vertexInDeviceSpace  vec4inverseScreenDimensions  vertexInScreenSpace     Store transformed vertex     glPosition  vertexInScreenSpace   codepre  pThis code results in all transformations and normal calculations not included to be done correctly, however each face of my models constantly fighting to be above all the others. The only time I have no issues is standing inside of the first model being drawn, then nothing flickers and I can view the inside of Suzannes head just as I should be able to.p  pAfter weeks of trying anything I could possibly think of I finally worked my way to a solution which involves changingadding a mere two lines of code. First, I added this line to the end of my main function in my vertex shaderp  precodeglPosition.z  0.0001vertexInScreenSpace.z codepre  pThe addition of this line of code caused every bit of zfighting to go away, except now the depth buffer was completely backwards, vertices further away were being reliably drawn on top of vertices in front. This is my first question, why would this line of code cause more reliable behaviorp  pNow that I had reliable behavior and no more depthfighting it was a matter of reversing the draw order, and so I changed my call to glDepthRange to the followingp  precodeglDepthRange1.0f, 0.0f codepre  pI was under the assumption that glDepthRange0.0f, 1.0f would cause objects closer to my ZNEAR 0.1 to be closer to 0 and objects closer to my ZFAR1000 to be closer to 1. Then, having my Depth Test set to GLLESS would make perfect sense, matter of fact this should be the case regardless of what my ZNEAR and ZFAR are because of the way that glDepthRange maps the values, if Im not mistaken.p  pI must be mistaken though, because this line change would mean that objects closer to me would store a value closer to 1 in the depth buffer and objects further would have a value of 0 rendering a backwards draw order but sure enough it works like a charm.p  pIf anybody can point me in the direction of why my assumptions are wrong and what I could possibly be not factoring into my understanding of glsl and depth buffering. I would rather not move on with progress of my engine until I completely understand the functioning of its foundation.p  pbEditb The contents of my cameraPerspective matrix are as follows Perspective matrix diagramp  precodeAspectX     0           0               0 0           AspectY     0               0 0           0           1               0 0           0         1focalLength         0 codepre  pWhere AspectX is 16 and AspectY is 9. The focal length defaults to 70, however controls were added to change this during runtime.p  pPointed out by derhass, this does not explain how any of the information passed to glOrtho is taken into account by the shader. The viewport dimensions, due to not using the standard pipeline amp matrix stack, are considered with inverseScreenDimensions. This is a vec4 which contains [1XRIGHT, 1YUP, 1ZFar, 1]. Or for lack of variable names, [11000, 11000, 11000, 1].p  pMultiplying the screen coordinates vector by this in my vertex shader results in an X value between 1 and 1, a Y value between 1 and 1, a Z value between 0 and 1 If the object was in front of the camera it had a negative z coordinate to begin with, and a W of 1.p  pIf Im not mistaken, this would be the final step to reach device coordinates, followed by drawing the mesh.p  pemPlease keep in mind the original question I know this is not streamlined, I know Im not using GLM or all the most often used libraries for this, however my question is not Hey guys fix this My question is Why was this fixed by the changes I madeemp

I have copied the PHP software binary and modules from the production system to my local system to make sure it isnt due to a difference in machinenetwork. Running the production PHP software on my local system also runs slow. So the problem is not machine or network. Since it is the same script it is also not something with my script. This points to one of three possibilitiesp  ul liDifference in PHP versionli liDifference in Mongo driver versionli liDifference in configurationli ul  pThe script in question iterates through all records in the collection and makes an update for each one. The update has the write concern set to 0 as speed is more important than knowing it was executed successfully. The PHP profiler stopped providing information once it called update since update is implemented in C. So I turned next to strace to see if the system calls could help explain the difference in speed. The loop where the updates are being issued has the following strace output on the fast systemp  precodesendto3, 20200020600000003217000000properties2..., 130, MSGDONTWAIT, NULL, 0  130 write1, ., 1                         1 sendto3, 20200020700000003217000000properties2..., 130, MSGDONTWAIT, NULL, 0  130 write1, ., 1                         1 sendto3, 20200021000000003217000000properties2..., 130, MSGDONTWAIT, NULL, 0  130 write1, ., 1                         1 codepre  pI am outputting . between each update so I have feedback to indicate how fast the updates are going.

It looks like it is checking the reply which to me indicates its not using write concern 0. The major difference between the two PHP installations is the fast one is using driver 1.4.5 while the slow one is using 1.5.3.p  pI compared the update code for both versions. In 1.4.5 a hrefhttpsgithub.commongodbmongophpdriverblob1.4.5collection.cL957 relnofollowit seems to just send the message and returna. On the other hand looking at 1.5.3 a hrefhttpsgithub.commongodbmongophpdriverblobmastercollection.cL1017 relnofollowit sends the message then gets a replya. I dont see anything about skipping checking the reply if the write condition is 0. If you follow the code that extracts the reply you can see where it eventually calls these two additional system calls.p  pCan someone who understand this better help me figure out how to get my code running fast in production. On the fast PHP install mongo driver 1.4.5 the script executes in just 23 minutes. On the slow system mongo driver 1.5.3 I killed it after 30 minutes because I was tired of waiting. Who knows how long it would have taken to get fully done.p

errors. However, nothing was printed to the console.p  pI also scanned several ports using a port scanner and it seems that my school network has blocked all of them, since they return as closed. However, Ive made another clientserver application earlier, in which both the client and the server were coded purely in java as a desktop application. In that case, I used localhost 127.0.0.1 as the ip address and tried the application with multiple ports, and it worked. I also tried that application with my connections public ip address and it worked.p  pTherefore, I am starting to think that this isnt a problem connecting to a port, but rather a problem with the android client side of the application. But I cannot figure out what is wrong.p  pBy the way, both my phone running the client and my laptop running the server were connected to the same network while I tried to send the message.p

Negative 7002 pI have an rdl that I have loaded into a Powershell xml variable. I want to add a query parameter to each of the data sets in the report, but I find that I first have to check to see if the data set has any query parameters first.p  pIf a data set does not have any query parameters then it does not have a QueryParameters node to call AppendChild on. p  pMy rdl is loaded into a variable called target. I can get all of the DataSet that dont have a QueryParameters node into a variable called nodes.

First, it will fetch an access token to perform the request. Then, it will fetch the requested user.

Negative 7002 pAs part of encrypting and saving data, we have generated KEYs using AES algorithm with openssl.p  precodeopenssl enc aes256cbc P nosalt codepre  pOpenssl has generated KEY amp IV values, which are been stored in a plain text file. Since, storing of keys in a plain document is a not secure standard, thought of moving it to Keystore.p  pTherefore, we have generated a Keystore using keytool by executing the below command.p  precodekeytool genseckey keyalg AES alias aesstore keysize 256 keypass changeit storetype jceks keystore hello.jceks storepass changeit codepre  pThis Keystore holds a random secrey key.

Negative 7002 pIm working on making a simple Twitter clone for a project using node.js and express, and storing the tweets using MongoDB. p  pI am trying to implement deleting functionality for the tweets. a users profile displays all their tweets, and I was hoping to put a little button or link under each tweet that a user will click for deleting. p  pSo, I was thinking the easiest way to do this would be specifying a delete URL for each tweet, like ....profiledelete[mongoDB object id here]. And then in node,say that when the router receives a get request for a URL like that, remove the object with the specified id from the database. p  pI have heard you can use regular expressions to match and parse URLs to do this, but I cant really find any resources on how. So how can I write a regular expression to match these URLs, and then parse the URL to get the object ID Or is there a better way to do thisp

Negative 7002 pScratching my head, this should be relatively easy but I cant figure it out. I want to build a header that is sticky fixed to top and responsive in the way that it switches to a mobile menu layout at a certain breakpoint. The mobile layout should have a full window height, having the navigation items in a vertical row, whereas the desktop mode should align them horizontally. In addition to that I need to contain the contents for the desktop mode at a certain width.p  pMy problem is, as I need to set the header or a container to a fixed position I also need to be able to switch height once the mobile layout sets in, from say 100px to 100 height.

Negative 7002 pAssuming I have some kind of data structure to work on for example images which I want to pre and postprocess in different ways to make further processing steps easier. Whats the best way to implement this responsibility with an OOP language like Cp  pFurther assuming I have a lot of different processing algorithms with inherent complexity I very likely want to encapsulate them in dedicated classes. This means though that the algorithm implementations externally have to set some kind of info in my data to indicate it having been processed. And that also doesnt look like clean design to me because having been processed seems like an info associated with the data and thus something the data object itself should determine and set on its own.p  pIt also looks like a very common source of error in complex applications Someone implements another processing algorithm, forgets to set the flags in the data appropriately, something in completely different parts of the application wont work as expected and someone will have lots of fun spotting the error.p  pCan someone outline a general structure of a good and failsave way to implement sth like thisp

When the form gets submitted the only ones that come through are the ones you can see hidden in source code.p  pi have also tried to do the followingp  pinsert codeltphp sessionstartgtcode at the top of the pagep  pand at the bottom of page i havep  precodeltphp         SESSION[Name]POST[Name]         SESSION[Postcode]POST[Postcode]         SESSION[Building]POST[Building]         SESSION[EmailAddress]POST[EmailAddress]         SESSION[Telephone]POST[Telephone]         SESSION[datepicker]POST[datepicker]         SESSION[timeofsurvey]POST[timeofsurver]         SESSION[PropertyOwner]POST[PropertyOwner] gt codepre  pI have these on each page to make sure they get passed across each page, All the input [names] are correct and on the same page where the iframe is they are displayed back to the user in a text box to the right side of the iframe basically to show the user that their information is correct while booking their appointment.p  pHere is my iframe form source codep  precodeltdiv idapp myapp mycontrollerControllergt     ltform actionProcessing.php idregForm nameregForm methodpostgt     ltinput typehidden valueltphp echo SESSION[Name]gt nameFull Namegt     ltinput typehidden valueltphp echo SESSION[Telephone]gt nameTelephonegt     ltinput typehidden valueltphp echo SESSION[EmailAddress]gt nameEmailgt     ltinput typehidden valueltphp echo SESSION[Building]gt  nameBuilding Number or Namegt     ltinput typehidden valueltphp echo SESSION[Postcode]gt namePostcodegt     ltinput typehidden valueltphp echo SESSION[PropertyOwner]gt namePropertyOwnergt         ltinput typehidden valueltphp echo POST[datepicker]gt nameSurvey Dategt     ltinput typehidden valueltphp echo POST[timeofsurvey]gt nameSurvey Timegt  codepre  pThe only hidden variables failing to display are the following  p  precode[Name] [EmailAddress] [datepicker] [timeofsurvey] codepre  pAll other variables are being displayed fine, As i said even the page that has the iframe inserted is also displaying all variables back to the user correctly. If you click to view page source code you see them fine... Then as soon as you view the inner iframe source code you see the variables above are missing.p  pThis is the outcome when viewing the iframe source codep  precodeltdiv idapp myapp mycontrollerControllergt ltform actionProcessing.php idregForm nameregForm methodpostgt ltinput typehidden value nameFull Namegt       lt This input is missing ltinput typehidden value0123456789 nameTelephonegt ltinput typehidden value nameEmailgt       lt This input is missing ltinput typehidden value  nameBuilding Number or Namegt ltinput typehidden valueNW1 1AA namePostcodegt ltinput typehidden valueYes namePropertyOwnergt     ltinput typehidden value nameSurvey Dategt       lt This input is missing ltinput typehidden value nameSurvey Timegt       lt This input is missing ltinput typehidden namefieldpassthrough1 valueConsumer gt ltinput typehidden namefieldpassthrough2 valueenUK gt codepre  pI hope i have not gone the longest way round here trying to explain, as i understand a lot of you guys are really to busy to be reading long posts like mine when it will be something so simple..

Negative 7002 pI have a web page that uses ZURB Foundation.  Thanks to the responsive design, the page collapses on mobile without needing a separate mobile page redirect.  One issue however, is that I have scrollbars that are great on computers, but stack on top of each other for mobile, making reaching the bottom of the page a pain.p  pHow can I using CSS and Javascript make it so that when the screen size is a mobile resolution that the scrollbars disappear, but the divs actually expand when this occurs When you hide the overflow it simply hides the overflow, instead of expanding the div.

How can I move these to routes.ini so all my routes are defined there Is there something missing from my rest routes in routes.ini I just want the same behaviour, but without having to define routes in two places some in routes.ini, some in Bootstrap.php. By the way, Ive tried putting these routes at the top of the routes.ini and bottom but always the same result.p

Negative 7002 pIm new to the site as a poster, but have used it for quite a while as I research new methods for my projects. I just cant seem to find the information I need for my current project, most likely because Im not working my searches right. Im hoping you guys can point me in a direction where I can get my answer.p  pProblem I work for a company with user all around the globe and have to keep in mind that our global users cannot see all available data. With that in mind, I do have a system where some scheduled tasks are setup that some of our global users had setup and then the system was restricted to US only users. Once this restriction was placed on the system, these scheduled tasks are not accessible to the users and unfortunately that must remain on this system.p  pTo address this, I have been tasked with setting up an internal web app that is accessible by our global users that will display the scheduled task information and allow the users to run any of the tasks manually if there is a need for it. Keep in mind, when the user runs the task, the command will need to come from the server hosting the site as it will be using a user account Domain account that has admin access to the server and can run the task as the global users have no access to this system.p  pI currently have most of this accomplished. I have a nice PHP page goes through an array filled with the Scheduled Tasks names, runs the SCHTASKS.EXE command with necessary arguements and switches on the server and retrieves the information for each Task. It then sorts the data and displays the needed data in a table format for the user to view. I also have a basic button being created for each task on each row of the table.p  pHere is the issue that I am running in.

Negative 7002 pI am working on my first website and I encountered a problem with the responsiveness of the fields in my search form. I use Wordpress theme and plugins and I am overriding their styles with my own. p  pThe field groups for Priceand BuildUp Area dont behave as expected when I change the size of the browser window. I created media queries for every browser size which breaks the structure, but it seems that I need about 10 separate queries, even more, which I consider as inappropriate.p  pe.g. I have a query for maxwidth 780px and then it appears that I have to create another one for maxwidth 767px, because for that browser size the structure is broken again . p  pI have red the original CSS code of the themeplugin, but I cant understand where the problem comes from.

Negative 7002 pI have an Xcode5 project that builds a static library as its product. While building this library i had turned on the Code coverage settings i.e. strongGenerate Test Coverage files and  Instrument Program Flowstrong.  As a result, when library was built, gcno files were created for all the files correspondingly in the same directory.p  pAnd in order to calculate its code coverage i have another project which links to this library and creates an executable. This project was also built with strongGenerate Test Coverage files and  Instrument Program Flowstrong as YES.p  pNow, upon executing this product, only the gcda files for the files in the project of my test executable are generated.p  pHow can i generate the gcda files for the static library that was linked into my project while building it. p

Negative 7002 pI have an AWS data pipeline that will be running every hour. Every time the pipeline runs, it grabs data from an S3 bucket of the previous hour the names of the buckets are based on the time of creation. Since the data files in S3 arent fully populated and created for about 45 minutes, Im grabbing those files from the previous hour.p  pSo to create that expression, I have written in a Script Variable to feed to my script codehhformatminusHoursscheduledStartTime,1,hhcodep  pThe above works fine for most of the day, except for at the top of the day, when the hour reads code0000code. The expression then is evaluated and calculated as code2300code, maybe 2400 I cant exactly remember. This is an issue because the day value of codescheduledStartTimecode doesnt decrement by 1. p  pSo is there a way to decrement by 1 Im using the codehhcode value to read the matching folder in S3 with the name of whatever codehhcode evaluates to. p  pWould a ShellCommandActivity work here I have little to no idea what Shell is, even after some researchp

ListView is not getting updated after emitting dataChanged signal actually sometimes during debugging the list get updated but the behaviour is unpredictable. Also codeQQmlChangeSetcode error I was getting earlier is gone. Should there be some time difference between codebeginInsertRowscode and codedataChangedcode Whether I call dataChanged from main thread or worker thread, its not updating. Please give suggestions.p

Negative 7002 pI have two images representing x and y values. The images are full of holes the holes are the same in both images.p  pI want to interpolate linear interpolation is fine though higher level interpolation is preferable along ONE of the axis in order to fill the holes.p  pSay the axis of choice is 0, that is, I want to interpolate across each column. All I have found with numpy is interpolation when x is the same e.g. numpy.interpolate.interp1d. In this case, however, each x is different i.e. the holes or empty cells are different in each row.p  pIs there any numpyscipy technique I can use Could a 1D convolution workthough kernels are fixed p

But my problem is that when the codeTextViewcode is placed inside the codeGridLayoutcode, the codeButtoncode stays where it is. I want to move the button relative to where the codeTextViewcode is placed.p

Negative 7002 pI have an old VB6 application which we do not have source code to edit. The application tries to open a table to a server but the table name has a period on it because the old provider allowed periods on table names. Now, we are trying to make a workaround using an MS ACCESS table. Problem is MS ACCESS do not allow periods on table names. p  pOur problem is that the VB6 application will request table name MAINDIR.ITEMSTABLE and it will return a TABLE NOT FOUND error because the table or query cannot be named on MS ACCESS with a period. Is there a way that we can do a VBA function that will trigger when an external ODBC call is made to the database that will see the incoming query and replace the table name Like for example if th VB6 application sends an SQL query likep  pSELECT  FROM DBNAME.TABLENAMEp  phow can I make it refer or modify the query so that it returnsp  pSELECT  FROM DBNAMETABLENAMEp  pThank you all for your help.p

Negative 7002 pI am building an application for the raspberry pi and use pi4j as a dependency for Software PWM on GPIO. Id like to test my code on my local machine though, so I would like to compile my code without the pi4j dependency and skip method calls to the library.p  pExample codep  precodens ledserver.model   require [clojure.tools.logging as log]   import [com.pi4j.wiringpi SoftPwm Gpio]  pi4j dependency, only compiles on rPi   defn softpwmwrite [pin value]   let [ival Mathround double  value RANGE]     SoftPwmsoftPwmWrite pin ival  call to pi4j. This is what I want to skip     loginfo pin pin set to ival    codepre  ppi4j requires the wiringPi C library, which is only available on the raspberry pi which makes sense. For testing on my dev machine it would be sufficient to see the log printout. I dont want to comment out the codeimportcode and method calls for testing, I would like a more elegant solution. p

I have tried altering the endianess to no avail.p  pThe server also reads input from another client I have no access to, but it handles its inputs correctly, so the problem lies in this client.p  pI have little experience with sockets and byte conversions, so I would be grateful if you provided me with some insight.

Any idea whats going onp  pThe below config is for the remote DB Im trying to write to.p  pstrongDB Configstrongp  precodeprod gt [     read      gt [         options gt [             PDOMYSQLATTRINITCOMMAND gt SET timezone  0400             ]     ],     write     gt [],     driver    gt mysql,     host      gt envPRODDBHOST, localhost,     port      gt envPRODDBPORT, 3306,     database  gt envPRODDBDATABASE, forge,     username  gt envPRODDBUSERNAME, forge,     password  gt envPRODDBPASSWORD, ,     charset   gt utf8,     collation gt utf8unicodeci,     prefix    gt ,     strict    gt false, ], codepre  pstrongModelstrongp  precodeltphp  namespace AppModelsRemote  use IlluminateDatabaseEloquentModel  class Promotion extends Model      protected connection  null     protected table  Tournament     protected primaryKey  tournamentId     protected guarded  [tournamentId]     public timestamps  false      public function construct              thisgtconnection  envAPPENV           public function gameplayLogs              return thisgthasManyGamePlayLog, tournamentId           public function scopeActivequery              return querygtwherestatus, 3       codepre  p Creation p  precodepublic function deployPromotionMainid      post  jsondecodefilegetcontentsphpinput, true     today  dateYmd His     promo  Promotionwith[assets]gtfindid      data  [         name                      gt promogtname,         description               gt promogtdescription,         gameId                    gt intvalpromogtgameId,         categoryId                gt intvalpromogtcategoryId,         subCategoryId             gt intvalpromogtsubCategoryId,         advertiserId              gt promogtadvertiserId,         advertiserCost            gt 0,         gamePlays                 gt promogtgamePlays,         promoStartDate            gt 20150101 000000,         promoEndDate              gt 20150102 000000,         createdDate               gt today,         updatedDate               gt today,         promoFileDuration         gt 0,         eventStartDate            gt promogtpromoStartDate,         eventEndDate              gt promogtpromoEndDate,         eventStartTime            gt 000 AM,         eventEndTime              gt 1100 PM,         minPlays                  gt 1,         maxPlays                  gt 0,         minAge                    gt 18,         maxAge                    gt 0,         scoringId                 gt 1,         minLevel                  gt 1,         maxLevel                  gt 0,         tournamentDifficultyId    gt 1,         timeId                    gt 1,         timeOut                   gt 15,         defaultPrice              gt 0,         limitGames                gt 1,         distributorId             gt 0,         stateId                   gt 0,         locationTypeId            gt 0,         questionSetId             gt 0,         status                    gt 3,         sendEmail                 gt 1,         kioskModelId              gt 2,         triviaCategoryId          gt 1,         duration                  gt 0     ]      foreach promogtassets as a           switcha[assetTypeId]               case 1                 data[eventFilePath]  uploadfilestournamentevent.a[assetName]                 data[promoFilePath]  uploadfilestournamentpromo.a[assetName]                 break             case 2                 data[imageFilePath]  uploadfilestournamentimage.a[assetName]                 data[thumbnailFilePath]  uploadfilestournamentimage.a[assetName]                 break             case 3                 data[iconFilePath]  uploadfilestournamenticon.a[assetName]                 break             case 7                 data[ruleFilePath]  uploadfilestournamentrule.a[assetName]                 break             default                 break                    foreach post[env] as env           if env  dev               devpromo  PromotionRemotecreatedata  ...

Negative 7002 pI have written an app in .net using the Google Admin Reports SDK that gets the used gmail quota.  In tests with my own account this works but in a specific real life scenario the returned value is incorrect.  p  pThe value returned is 400000Mb but should be 3Tb.  The value of 3Tb is obtained by exporting all the gmails using the Vault for search and export. p  pPreviously Postini was used which was migrated to Gmail and the value of 400000Mb accurately represents the total gmail in the mailbox since the migration.  Getting the used quota for Drive returns the same number.p  pSo the question is  where are the missing gamils and how do I get the storage size for them on a per mailbox basis.  Are they stored in the Vault as I understood that the Vault just provided an eDiscovery and compliance platform on top of gmail.p

Negative 7002 pI want to communicate between an arduino and an iPhone. The Idea is that the arduino hosts a small server accessible from the local network and the iPhone gives it information by connecting to it and doing a specific http GET request I hope thats what its called, please dont bite if it isnt. For example 124.566.123someIpp1 the GET request with information. p1 would maybe set pin 1 high. The whole process should be invisible to the user, meaning no  browser should be opened or so.    Is there a way to do this using objectivec p

Negative 7002 pThe problem p  pIm dynamically creating a snap element on button press in my code. Then when this element is created in a container containing a snapObject. If I dont try and dynamically create the drag and drop element it will recognize the drop container. p  pHowever, when I use uidraggable to detect snap events it doesnt detect them. p  precodevar snapped  this.datauidraggable.snapElements codepre  pI have also tried to to pass the dynamic id to p  precodevar uiid  ui  id.toString var snapped  this.datauidraggable.snapElements codepre  pThis produces a console error snap elements undefined. I know this is just a hole in my jquery knowledge but I dont quite see the problem.p  pstrongfunction instdraggableidstrong is the function that dunamically creates the drag element and looks for the snap event on button press.p  pstrongfunction buildSubnetidstrong is the code that generates the snap target on button press.p  pAny help would be appriciated.p  pMy overall goal is to register dynamic drag and drop events from elements and turn them into forms that are child elements of each snapped targets json. Drag and drop child element additions. Then it will build the form based on what type of element you selected to create. Thus, if I wanted to drop 5 asgs inside a subnet or snaptarget each one will be a child element of that snap target with its own unique id. and the snap target will have a unique id. Later I will build a json payload based on the elements on the page. I also need dynamic subnets. Im just explaining so you have a better idea of what im doing. This is just a quick test project. p  pa hrefhttpsgithub.comzukeruatomus relnofollowhttpsgithub.comzukeruatomusap  pFull Codep  precodelthtmlgt ltheadgt lttitlegtAtomuslttitlegt ltscript srchttpsajax.googleapis.comajaxlibsjquery2.1.3jquery.min.jsgtltscriptgt ltlink relstylesheet hrefcode.jquery.comui1.11.4themessmoothnessjqueryui.cssgt ltscript srccode.jquery.comjquery1.10.2.jsgtltscriptgt ltscript srccode.jquery.comui1.11.4jqueryui.jsgtltscriptgt ltscriptgt  document.readyfunction          var welImgfadeintime  1500         var welimgfadeouttime  5000         var leftcontainerfadeintime1000             .asgDragElementContainer.hide             .snapContainer.hide         .leftcontainer.hide         .fadeOnLoad.hide          .fadeOnLoad.fadeInwelImgfadeintime         .fadeOnLoad.fadeOutwelimgfadeouttime         .leftcontainer.fadeInleftcontainerfadeintimewelimgfadeouttime             .snapContainer.fadeInleftcontainerfadeintimewelimgfadeouttime         var welcome  document.getElementByIdwelcome         welcome.play   function instdraggableid     var classid  .  id.toString     var idid    id.toString     var uiid  ui  id.toString     classid.draggable         snap .snap,         stop functionevent, ui               Get the po0ssible snap targets              var snapped  this.datauidraggable.snapElements               Pull out only the snap targets that are snapping              var snappedTo  .mapsnapped, functionelement                  return element.snapping  element.item  null                            Display the results              var result              .eachsnappedTo, functionidx, item                  result  item.text  ,                           console.logui             results.htmlSnapped to   result    Nothing  result                    idid .draggable snap true    function getelementobject           var passid  Math.floorMath.random  100  1           var builddiv  ltdiv idpassid classpassid uiwidgetcontent stylezindex1000005width150pxheight150pxpositionabsolutebackgroundimage urlleftmenubg.jpggt                            ltimg width50 height50 srcaws.pnggt                             ltdivgt           .asgDragElementContainer.htmlbuilddiv           .asgDragElementContainer.fadeIn500           instdraggablepassid  function buildSubnetid           var htmlstring  div.snapContainer.html           var passid  Math.floorMath.random  100  1           div.snapContainer.htmlhtmlstring  ltdiv id passid gt                    ltdiv idpassid classsnap uiwidgetheadergtSubnet  passid  ltdiv idresultsgtltdivgtltdivgt                   ltdivgt             window.onscroll  function       window.scrollTo0,0  ltscriptgt ltheadgt  ltstylegt body      backgroundcolorblack    margin 0    padding 0     overflow hidden   .fadeOnLoad     width100     height100     positionabsolute     zindex 9000   this is the content container  .snapContainer     width100     height100     backgroundimage urlbg.jpg     positionabsolute     marginleft21   this is the menu container  .leftcontainer     width16     height100     backgroundimage urlleftmenubg.jpg     borderleftwidth 1px     padding50px     positionabsolute     zindex 0     webkitboxshadow 10px 0px 50px 2px rgba0,0,0,1     mozboxshadow 10px 0px 50px 2px rgba0,0,0,1     boxshadow 10px 0px 50px 2px rgba0,0,0,1    .draggable          width100px         height100px         backgroundcolor transparent         fontsize .9em  .asgDragElementContainer          width150px         height150px         fontsize .9em         backgroundcolortransparent  .snap          width 700px         height 300px         marginbottom 25px         margintop30px         marginleft28     positionabsolute  .belizeholeflatbutton      position relative     verticalalign top     width 100     height 60px     padding 0     fontsize 22px     color white     textalign center     textshadow 0 1px 2px rgba0, 0, 0, 0.25     background 2980b9     border 0     borderbottom 2px solid 2475ab     cursor pointer     webkitboxshadow inset 0 2px 2475ab     boxshadow inset 0 2px 2475ab  .belizeholeflatbuttonactive      top 1px     outline none     webkitboxshadow none     boxshadow none   ltstylegt ltbodygt  ltdiv classfadeOnLoadgtltimage src .splash.jpg width100 height100gtltaudio idwelcome srcwelcome.wav preloadautogt ltdivgt ltdiv classleftcontainergt     ltcentergt         ltdiv classonethird columngt             ltpgtltinput typesubmit valuesubnet classbelizeholeflatbutton onClickbuildSubnetthis.idgt             ltpgt         ltdivgt          ltdiv idASG classonethird columngt             ltpgtltinput typesubmit valueasg classbelizeholeflatbutton onClickgetelementthisgt             ltpgt         ltdivgt      ltcentergt ltdivgt ltdiv classsnapContainergtltdiv classasgDragElementContainergtltdivgtltdivgt ltbodygt codepre
Negative 7002 pI have a Question and Answer app as a part of a project and it displays questions with their answers underneath. If someone deletes a question then its deleted field is set to True and the question is still displayed but the text is replaced by deleted. This is so that the answer thread still exists.p  pHowever, if all of the answers are deleted then I want the whole thread to go away. Ive tried to write a query which returns these questions but Im getting a emCase object has no attribute nullem exception when it reaches the final exclude. Also, my annotation isnt spitting out a boolean as expected so perhaps Im using the conditional incorrectly.

Negative 7002 pI have two programs the first one filters images and its called LRSR.exe the second one, called ALGOc.exe, calls the first one and gives it the image to filter. The programs should be able to filter 8 and 16 bits per channel images. The procedure is that I run ALGOc, I pick an image, I tune some parameters and, when I play execute, it sends all those information to LRSR.exe thats do the stuff. It almost works fine but one thing if I pass a 16bpc image to LRSR.exe it filter the image in a crappy way. The strange thing is that if I pick the image directly with LRSR.exe running it from terminal instead of calling it with ALGOc it works good and gives the right result..p  pEDIT  here it is part of the code hopefully, the useful partp  pALGOc Thats the calling programp  precodepublic int dist  public int numI public int spra  public int ker public int irc public String urlImg [...] pb.commandfolder  exe,urlImg,urlOutput, N,n,ker,ker,irc,irc codepre  pHis role is to pass to LRSR.exe some parameters.p  pfolderexe is the directory where the image will be saved, urlImg is the name of the file to filter, urlOutput is the name used to save the file after its processed.p  pNow, lets say I have an image called IMG. I would usually run ALGOc, pick IMG, select an output folder, set some parameters and click on execute. The ALGOc program calls LRSR.exe, gives him all the parameters it needs the one I listed some rows above and then LRSR.exe process the images and store a new one. The problem is when IMG is a 16bpc image. In that case, if I follow the procedure I just explained, it gives as output a crappy image. The strange thing is that the result is almost identical to the one I get from executing it with n and N parameters tuned as 1. I thought that was the problem wrong data pass from one program to the other one, so I made LRSR.exe write on a txt files these two parameters, and the result is that they are fine.. they are the ones I pass him. All this mess doesn happen if I run LRSR without using ALGOc to call him. If I call LRSR directly from terminal .LRSR.exe IMG IMGoutputName, it works fine and the result is as it should be.p  pIt also works fine if I use ALGOc to call LRSR but IMG is not 16bpc but 8 and thats another reason that makes me think its not a parametergetting problem..p  pPlease let me know if you need any more informationp
