Positive 681 pI have to develop a code which receives single precision inputs and should return single precision outputs all netcdf files.p  pMy idea was to use for internal operations single precision variables, however Ive been told that I should be using double precision instead.p  pI would have to read the single precision inputs from netcdf as double, process them and, then, report them as single again.p  pThe argument was that now with 64bits architectures, the output resulting from double precision variables has higher accuracy than single precision operations.p  pIs that right Its not clear to me.

Positive 681 pLets focus on one dll CWindowsSystem32wbemwmiutils.dll. Why Because its the file in which I personally discovered Windows delivers a different dll depending on process architecture.p  pTLDR Is there a way to programmatically determine the actual path of the dll that was returned by the file system redirectorp  pI understand that if launched as a x86 process, I get CWindowsSysWOW64wbemwmiutils.dll. And, if launched as a x64 process, I get CWindowsSystem32wbemwmiutils.dll.p  pI need to determine which wmiutils.dll Im actually looking at. The redirector makes system32wbemwmiutils.dll look and feel identical but its not.

Based on my use case, Ive come up with a couple hacks but theyre just that. Hoping somebody has found a solution as easy as parent path that actually works in this case.p

Positive 681 pLast night I tried installing Numpy on Windows 8. I have Python 2.7.10 installed on my Windows 8.1 Pro machine. Initially I realized that the only way to easily install Numpy is to install the 1.3 version[1] , which is pretty old. Then I found out that pip can install Numpy, but since my OS is a 64bit one I cannot use pip directly and have to first deal with Cython, Fortran and other stuffs installation [2].

Positive 681 pI know that is bad practice to print an integer with lu which is a unsigned long. In a project i was working on i got a large number when trying to print 11 with lu in the snprint format.old code I am using gcc 4.9.3.p  pThis code below i thought would produce the wrong number since snprintf is told to read more than the 4 bytes occupied. Its doesnt though. Works perfectly. It reads everything correctly. Either it does not go past the 4 bytes in to the unknown or the extra 4 bytes in the long are fully of zeros when it gets promoted to long from int.p  pI am wondering out of curiosity is when does printf print the wrong number What conditions does it need produce a wrong big number There has to be garbage in the upper 4 bytes but it seems like it does not set that garbage for me.p  pI read the answers here but the code worked for me. I know its a different compiler.p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions12120062printinginttypewithlucxinuPrinting int type with lu  CXINUap  precode  includeltinttypes.hgt   includeltstdio.hgt     int mainvoid         uint32t number1  11         char sentence[40]         snprintfsentence,40,Small number lu , Big numberlu n,number1,285212672         printfsentence      codepre

Positive 681 pAs I understand the x64 calling convention in Windows based on a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms235286.aspx relnofollowthisa and a hrefhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiX86callingconventionsMicrosoftx64callingconvention relnofollowthisap  ul liThe first 4 arguments are passed in registers, although 32 bytes of shadow size is reserved in the stack.li liThe overall stack must be 16byte aligned although individual arguments dont have to be.li liArguments that are 1, 2, 4, or 8 bytes can go on the stack.  All other arguments must be passed by reference.li ul  pHow are individual arguments aligned Since I couldnt find anything that specifically addressed this, and based on how I thought alignment worked in x86, I assumed that 32bit ints could be aligned at 4byte boundaries.  So, for example, if function arguments 5 and 6 were both 32bit ints, I would have expected them to be at stack offsets 32 and 36.  However, from looking at my compilers assembly output, theyre at offsets 32 and 40 i.e., theyre 8byte aligned, even though they take up 4 bytes.p  pIn other words, why does the following function call work in x64, even though its passing 64bit codeuint64tcodes when 32bit ints are expectedp  precodeint i  1 uint64t p  6 double v  2.5 printfi .fni .fn, i, p, v, i, p, v codepre

Negative 681 pShort version is in the title.p  pLong version I am working on a program for scientific optimization using Java.  The workload of the program can be divided into parallel and serial phases  parallel phases meaning that highly parallelizable work is being performed.  To speed up the program it runs for hoursdays I create a number of threads equal to the number of CPU cores on the machine Im using  typically 4 or 8  and divide the work between them.  I then start these threads and join them before proceeding to a serial phase.p  pSo far so good.  Whats bothering me is that the CPU utilization and speedup of the parallel phases is nowhere near the theoretical maximum  e.g. if I have 4 cores, I expect to see somewhere between 350400 utilization as reported by top but instead it bounces around between 180 and about 310. Using only a single thread, I get 100 CPU utilization.p  pThe only reasons I know of for threads not to run at full speed are     blocking due to IO     blocking due to synchronizationp  pNo IO whatsoever is going on in my parallel threads, nor any synchronization  the only data structures shared by the threads are readonly, and are either basic types or nonconcurrent collections.  So Im looking for other explanations.  One possibility would be that several threads are repeatedly blocking for garbage collection, but that would only seem to make sense in a situation with memory pressure, and I am allocating well above the required maximum heap space.  p  pAny suggestions would be appreciated.p  pbUpdateb Just in case anyone is curious, after some more investigation I tweaked the code for general performance and am seeing better utilization, even though nothing I changed has to do with synchronization.  However, some of the changes should have resulted in fewer new heap allocations in particular I got rid of some use of biteratorsb and btermporary boxed numbersb The CERN Colt library for highperformance Java computing was useful here it provides collections like IntArrayList, DoubleArrayList etc for basic types..  So I think garbage collection was probably the culprit.  p

Negative 681 pHello all I have a problem. I have a masterpage that all of my Content pages inherit from. Within this masterpage I have a script tag pointing to the Javascript file folder Scriptsvalidation.jsp  pOn my content pages I use different usercontrols that require the use of many of the functions within the validation.js file however if I dont put the  tag and the Javascript functions within a contentholder on the contentpage the usercontrols do not see these functions and I get errors like OnNameValidation is not defined.p  pOf course I can copy the Javascript code into all of the pages but thats 30 pages and a maintenance nightmare if I find a bug in one of the Javascript functions. p  pSo the question if you havent already figured out from my long dissertation is how can I declare the script tag with the path to the validation.js file so that contentpages and their usercontrols etc. can access the functionscode.p

Negative 681 pI am currently working on an app that uses custom annotate querysets. Currently i have 2 urls setup, but i would need one for each field that the users would like to summarize data for.

Below is an example of the code from the managerp  precodereturn self.filterstartdatetimeyearyear.filterstartdatetimemonthmonth.filterstartdatetimedayday.valuesfield.annotateCountfield codepre  pIn addition, i pass the value of emfieldem as context variable.

Negative 681 pI am attempting to make a search very complicated of course, to make it easier for usersp  pIve got an app with 3 models Campaigns, Businesses and Locationsp  plike sop  precode campaign.rb   belongsto business   hasmany locations, through gt business   actsasmappable   business.rb   hasmany campaigns   hasmany locations   location.rb   belongsto business   hasmany campaigns, through gt business   actsasmappable codepre  pThe way this is set up, there are some businesses that have multiple locations. For those that dont, the geokit info is coded into the campaign database entry.  For those that do have multiple locations the geokit info is coded into the location database entry.p  pI am trying to do a search for campaigns that will return the results within a certain distance. This is simple enough when dealing with businesses that have a single address.p  precode  Campaign.findall,          conditions gt [blahblahblah],        origin gt address,        within gt distance         codepre  pHowever, I want to also include campaigns that belong to businesses that have multiple locations. I want the search to return a result for that campaign, if the business has multiple locations, and if any of those locations fall within the bounds.  I was thinking something likep  precode  Campaign.findall,         include gt [business, locations]        conditions gt [blahblahblah],        origin gt address,        within gt distance         codepre  pBut this doesnt return any results for campaigns that belong to businesses that have multiple locations.  Im a noob when it comes to SQL so Im not exactly sure how to have rails search in one model Campaign, and search across another model the Business model to grab results from the Location model.  The fact that geokit is involved makes it even more complex.p  pI tried codeactsasmappable through gt locationscode in the campaign.rb but it just threw an sql errorp  pI messed around with a polymorphic model addressable but I found I would pretty much have to start from the ground up on the controllers of the other models.p  pIve also thought about namedscopes but I believe that geokit does not support them.p  pAny suggestionsp

Negative 681 pI was tearing my hair out to get this done...particularly for an html5 detection script. I wanted a variable that is set only once and that cant be overwritten again. This is itp  precodevar StaticConfiguration   StaticConfiguration.Main       html5 null  StaticConfiguration.getVariable  functionname      return StaticConfiguration.Main[  name]  StaticConfiguration.setVariable  functionname, value      ifStaticConfiguration.Main[  name]  null          StaticConfiguration.Main[  name]  value       codepre  pFirst, I define a global object StaticConfiguration containing all of these variables  in my case, just html5. I set it to null, since I want to set it inside the application. To do so, I callp  precodeStaticConfiguration.setVariablehtml5, true codepre  pIts set then. If I try to set it again, it fails  of course, since html5 is not null anymore. So I practically use the underscore to hide the static variable.p  pThis is helping me a lot. I hope its a good approach  please tell me if not p

Negative 681 pI am writing a client application that will run on Android phones that will interact with an OAuth server on the users behalf.  I have the OAuth server side code running on my web server for maintaining the OAuth session details while handshaking with the remote OAuth server.  Now I am wrangling with how to best handle the client side considerations on the smart phone.p  pLets assume for this question that I have, in the past, received an access token granted to me by the remote OAuth server after they logged the user in and the user granted my application access rights.  Lets also assume it is a good until revoked access token.p  pThe main concern of course is implementing something that does not leave the user at risk.  The simplest method would be to have my web server return the access token to my client code on the smart phone in encrypted form, and simply store that encrypted token in the users local storage.  Or for even tougher security, return my own encrypted unique identifier that my client code on the smart phone passes in with each request.  My web server could then decrypt the received ID, and lookup the most recent access token in a local database.  This seems pretty secure except in the case of the user losing the phone.  I guess I could implement something like the remember me option on browsers so if the user does not check it then a new reauthorization session would be triggered every session.  p  pIf my application were dealing with financial information then I would not even consider a remember me option, but the application behind the remote OAuth server is more on the level of sensitivity of Twitter or Flickr.p  pMy questions arep  ul liIs my proposed access token management and OAuth handling scheme sound and secure enough for the application I am describingli liAre there better methods  If so whatli liAny other thoughts or comments you might have on OAuth and mobile phonesli ul  p UPDATE  found these very helpful thread in the related questions list after this post was publishedp  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1934187oauthsecretsinmobileappsOAuth secrets in mobile appsap  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2397428caniavoidbakingmytwitterapiconsumersecretintomyiphoneappbinaryCan I avoid baking my Twitter API consumer secret into my iPhone app binaryap  p UPDATE 2  If you switch from a Sessions OAuth store to a database store like MySQL, remember to register the server for the given consumer key and user ID or you will get an error when you call requestRequestToken.

Negative 681 pI have outsourced and built a set of .net libraries and will be selling them soon.  I have looked around and am trying to figure out if I need an installer to install them. Do I just let the users download a zip file with the DLLs and the help file, or do I need an installer that will place them in a directory, and then the user can add the references to the DLLs that wayp  pAny suggestions would be great.p  pUpdate I really appreciate the feedback.  The approach I am going to take is offer both an installer and just the actual DLLs in a zip file, batch file, Help file and code snippets.  That solution should mitigate the issues some people have voiced over an installer.  The installer will do all of the above automatically. Thanks againp

Negative 681 pIm building a basic routing system in order to get rid of the index.phppageid2 stuff and use nicely formed URL like newsregionalsportsbaseballjuniorleague2010 which, for example, would take me to the baseball news of the junior league in 2010p  pThe basic structure is like this there is a router that evaluates the url and accesses an appropriate controller and calls a method with some optional arguments.

Negative 681 pI have an Azure worker role running that, among other functions, makes some HTTP requests once every 80 seconds or so. This happens continuously. As we scale up, it might be making a lot more HTTP requests, so I wrote the code to use BeginGetResponse, EndGetResponse and a callback. The problem is... we have a memory leak somewhere.

Sometimes the GC will kick in and free up some unused objects, but it continues its slow downward trend..p  pWhen our callback executes and we finish the request with EndGetResponse, emwe dont touch the response stream.em All we need to know is the HTTP status code, which we save for our own records.

Negative 681 pFor some reason I just cant seem to get my head around the process of creating a CArray instance variable for a class that can have elements added to it dynamically at runtime.p  pMy goal is to create a class called codeAEMeshcode. All codeAEMeshcode objects will have a carray storing the vertexdata for that specific codeAEMeshcodes 3D model for use with OpenGL ES more specifically its functionality for drawing a model by passing it a simple CArray of vertexdata.p  pInitially I was using an codeNSMutableArraycode, on the assumption that I could simply pass this array to OpenGL ES, however that isnt the case as the framework requires a CArray. I got around the issue by essentially creating a CArray of all of the vertexdata for the current codeAEMeshcode when it came time to render that specific mesh, and passing that array to OpenGL ES. Obviously the issue here is performance as I am constantly allocating and deallocating enough memory to hold every 3D models vertexdata in the app about a dozen times a second.p  pSo, Im not one to want the answer spoon fed to me, but if anyone would be willing to explain to me the standard idiom for giving a class a mutable carray some articles Ive read mention using codemalloccode I would greatly appreciate it. From the information Ive gathered, using malloc might work, but this isnt creating a standard carray I can pass in to OpenGL ES, instead its more of a pseudocarray that works like a carrayp  pAnyways, I will continue to experiment and search the internet but again, if anyone can offer a helping hand I would greatly appreciate it.p  pThanks,   Adam Eisfeldp

Negative 681 pIm fairly new to this so please go easy on me if this is a dumb question. I set the base SDK to 4.3 and deployment target to 4.0 so in theory, it should run on everything inbetween. The app works with no problems on all iPad and iPhone simulator versions between 4.0 to 4.3. However, when I uploaded the .ipa file to testflightapp.com and someone tested it on an iPhone 3G running OS 4.2.1, it seems to crash on launch. Since it runs fine on the same version of the simulator, this makes me think there is something in project settings I havent done right. Ive looked through the 4.3 upgrade notes and Im not making use of any of the added features so that doesnt seem to be my problem. Setting the base SDK and deployment target were the only things Ive done in terms of customizing the project for different iOS versions. Is there anything else I could try to make it run on that iPhonep

Negative 681 pPreface I am not using .xib files.  p  pI instantiate a UINavigationController in a class that effectively serves as my rootViewController.  This rootViewController also has two UITableViewController members that are drawn on different sections of the iPad screen.  One of which is set as the root view for the navigation controller.  Lets call it tableViewControllerA.  p  pThe problem is, when I invoke pushViewController on a valid UINavigationController, I see no effect  [tableViewControllerA.navigationController pushViewControllertableViewControllerX animatedYES] p  pIve gathered from the posts Ive searched today, that this push method should in turn cause the screen to redraw the top of stack controller.view.  This is not what Im seeing.p  pIt seemed there was a disconnect in my implementation, and it was time to reference a working example in my environment xcode 4.0.  Assuming the canned templates would provide a working basis, I created a new navigationbased applications.  I simply modified didFinishLaunchingWithOptions as follows.p  precode    UIViewController view1  [[UIViewController alloc] init]     UIViewController view2  [[UIViewController alloc] init]      view1.title  view1     view2.title  view2      [self.navigationController pushViewControllerview1 animatedYES]     [self.navigationController pushViewControllerview2 animatedYES]      self.window.rootViewController  [[UINavigationController alloc] initWithRootViewControllerview1]      [view1 release]     [view2 release] codepre  pI found similar results.  When I launch the simulator the screen title reads the title of whatever the self.window.rootViewController is pointing at.  With the code as is, the title of the resulting top screen reads view1.  When I initWithRootViewControllerview2, the resulting top screen reads view2.  p  pSo please tell me Im stupid cuz xyz... Thanks.  p

Negative 681 pIm trying to structure my iPhone app and was wondering if Im on the right track. Im not using any Navigation Controller or Tab Bar Controllerp  ul liI start with the AppDelegate and put a rootViewController in itli liThis rootViewController inits two other viewControllers and is responsible for swapping between themli liEach of these two viewControllers adds additional viewControllers and is responsible for swapping between themli ul  blockquote precode   ROOT         VC1VC2                   VC2.1VC2.2VC2.3 etc. codepre blockquote  pI was wondering if this is setup is OK or totally flawed. Should I rather use views instead of viewControllers In same instances, there is quite a huge hierarchy of viewControllers and I guess this isnt very good practice. E.g. in the example above VC2.3 is called by VC2 which is called by the ROOT viewController.p

Negative 681 pI have a Request class that is used to retrieve a file resource from an external process, using a method codeRetrieveResourcecode. This method takes approximately 1015 seconds to complete. In addition, the codeRequestcode class contains four child objects, which are instantiated using dependency injection during the construction of the class, to access the contents of the requested file. p  pThe codeRequestcode class is instantiated from the main class of the project. The main class calls codeRetrieveResourcecode approximately every 30 seconds. After each invocation, it may be necessary to adjust a particular property, for example, Property A, of one or more of the emchild objectsem of the codeRequestcode class.p  pI would be interested to hear views of the best way to accomplish this. The following list describes three approaches that could be used to change the value of Property Ap  ol lipThe main class explicitly sets the value of Property A on each child object of the Request object by calling the property directly. For example, codeRequest.Object1.PropertyA  newValuecode pli lipCreate a method in the Request class to update the value of Property A on each child object, for example, codeUpdatePropertyAcodepli lipWhen creating an instance of the codeRequestcode class, pass a builder class that is responsible for creating a new codeRequestcode instance, including the creation of the each of the four objects using DI. The builder class contains a property, for example, Property A, which is then used to set the value of the property of the name for each child object of the Request class.pli ol  pGrateful to hear thoughts. Thanks.p

Negative 681 pI am currently designing a portfolio website with wordpress. The idea is that its going to be all in one page, and use js to scroll up and down.p  pAfter coding the whole thing in fixed width, I thought of the responsive design.

Before doing anything else I am going back to photoshop and reediting the design for mobile  to quickly see what I want for mobile almost mobile first, at least on photoshop, kind of ignoring what I already havep  pIn my current design I display my work examples in slideshow. I am using this plugin a hrefhttpcsstricks.com3412anythingsliderjqueryplugin relnofollowhttpcsstricks.com3412anythingsliderjqueryplugina. my first instinct is to remove these slideshows when for mobile and use only one image for one each work. is that good ideap  pAlso I seen some responsive design tutorials which use the same images for all resolutions and then scale them down with css. Should I have different sized images for mobile for examplep  precodemedia screen and maxdevicewidth 480px    .img      backgroundurlsitesmall.jpg     media screen and maxdevicewidth 600px    .img      backgroundurlsitelarge.jpg     codepre  pAs I said my portfolio site is all in one page, and I use the jquery ScrollTo feature to get this effect on navigation a hrefhttptwo24studios.com relnofollowhttptwo24studios.coma. For mobile version, should I remove that or notp  pI have some decorative images which simply look impressive and adds very little more to the interaction, would it be better if I remove them when screen gets smaller. And on this note though I didnt look into it yet if I what to remove some content when on small screen, do I only use displaynone or is there a way to prevent the content from loading for no reason.p  pI am using one embedded font for the design, is it ok to keep that for the mobile version or is there any restriction on that, such as do mobile browsers support fontface embedding.p  pAnd the very final thing, I am planing to create a new page within wordpress, and call it something like playground which would have a list of demos on html5, CSS3 and the like just to show off my skills. should I include that in the mobile version or not. As I think a mobile user cant really take advantage of thatp  pI hope you can help me with any of these uncertainties that I havep

Negative 681 pThis is an extension of the original question of selecting a random line from a text of X lines where the probability of the text line selected is 1X. The trick is to select the Jth line if you query a random variable Y with a range of [0,1 and it returns a value less than 1J.p  pNow in this new version of the problem we have to select K random lines where K is less than X. I believe the probability for each line should be KX.p  pIm stuck on how to extend the original solution to K lines. Is it possible any explanations would be great.p

Negative 681 pI am writing a plugin for an application in C.

The requirement is to allow two applications on the same PC to share data.

N codepre  pThen, in the Django App, the form displays codeYcode the other choice. It is like the Django App cant see the MySQL value, so it defaults to codeYcode. If, through the Django App, I select codeNcode and save the form, THEN the value sticks to codeNcode in Django. p  pWhy would this be happeningp  pstrongEDITstrong  to add some codep  pForms.pyp  precodeclass SystemContactFormModelForm     class Meta         model  SystemContact         exclude  isMainContact, systemOwner, companyName, isRessyContact codepre  pViews.pyp  precodedef contactdetailsrequest, scID     redirectto  request.REQUEST.getnext, systemscontacts     if request.method  POST         syscontEdit  SystemContact.objects.getpkscID         form  SystemContactFormrequest.POST, instancesyscontEdit          if form.isvalid             form.save             return HttpResponseRedirectredirectto     else         syscontView  SystemContact.objects.getpkscID         form  SystemContactForminstancesyscontView      c           formform,         cancelredirectto               return rendertoresponsepagessystemscontactdetails.html, c, contextinstanceRequestContextrequest codepre  pModels.pyp  precodeclass SystemContactmodels.Model ISMAINCONTACTCHOICES       Y, Yes,     N, No,   ISSYSTEMOWNERCHOICES       Y, Yes,     N, No,   ISRESSYCONTACTCHOICES       Y, Yes,     N, No, this is a commercial contact,   TRADECHOICES       EL, Electrician,     LA, Landscaper,     PL, Plumber,     TR, Trencher,   SNAILMAILCHOICES       Y, Yes,     N, No,   SNAILMAILINVOICECHOICES       Y, Yes,     N, No,    firstInitial  models.CharFieldmaxlength  10, verbosename  First Initial, blank  True, null  True firstName  models.CharFieldmaxlength  60, verbosename  First Name, blank  True, null  True lastName  models.CharFieldmaxlength  160, verbosename  Last Name, blank  True, null  True phonetically  models.CharFieldmaxlength  100, verbosename  Phonetically, blank  True, null  True companyName  models.CharField maxlength  160, verbosename  Company Name, blank  True, null  True Only used for Commercial Owners, no other field needed homePhone  models.CharFieldmaxlength  60, verbosename  Home Phone Number, blank  True, null  True officePhone  models.CharFieldmaxlength  60, verbosename  Office Phone Number, blank  True, null  True cellPhone  models.CharFieldmaxlength  60, verbosename  Cell Phone Number, blank  True, null  True faxNumber  models.CharField maxlength 60, blankTrue, nullTrue, verbosename  Fax Number isMainContact  models.CharField maxlength  3, verbosename  Is the Main Contact, choices  ISMAINCONTACTCHOICES, defaultN isRessyContact  models.CharField maxlength  3, verbosename  Is this a Ressy Contact, choices  ISRESSYCONTACTCHOICES, defaultY isArchived  models.BooleanFieldverbosename  Archived, default  False systemOwner  models.CharField maxlength  3, verbosename  Is a System Owner, choices  ISSYSTEMOWNERCHOICES, defaultN  this is just a flag to say they own a system worksFor  models.CharField maxlength  70, verbosename  Works For, blank  True, null  True tradeType  models.ForeignKeyContactTrade, blankTrue, nullTrue, verbosenameTrade emailAddress  models.EmailFieldverbosename  Email Address, blank  True, null  True  billingAddress  models.CharFieldmaxlength  150, verbosename  Billing Address, blankTrue, nullTrue  billingCity  models.CharFieldmaxlength  90, verbosename  Billing City, blankTrue, nullTrue billingProvince  models.CharFieldmaxlength  30, verbosename  Billing Province, blankTrue, nullTrue billingPostalCode  models.CharFieldmaxlength  10, verbosename  Billing Postal Code, blankTrue, nullTrue snailMailOnly  models.CharFieldmaxlength  3, verbosename  Snail Mail Only, choices  SNAILMAILCHOICES, defaultY snailMailInvoice  models.CharFieldmaxlength  3, verbosename  Snail Mail Invoice, choices  SNAILMAILINVOICECHOICES, defaultY codepre

Negative 681 pIm building a site on Rails using ActiveMerchant to clear payments through Authorize.net.  Wed like to support paying for a subscription to the site using recurring credit card payments.  The Authorize.net Gateway allows me to setup a schedule of recurring payments on a given interval from a specified date.  I see httpdeveloper.authorize.nettoolsarberrorcodes that they will give me an error if the credit cards expiration date is before the start of the recurring payment period, or if the test transaction is not approved at the time that the recurring payment is setup.p  pWhat Im unclear on is how best to handle transaction failures which may occur after the recurring payment has been setup.  For example, what if the credit card used to setup the recurring payment is cancelled, or if the account has insufficient funds, before the end of the recurring period.p  pShould I be proactively checking the status of the subscriptions I have previously created in a cron job  Should I check the subscription status with Authorize.net each time my users login  Is there some other way in which I should expect to be notified if my previously valid subscriptions cease to be sop  pThanks.p

Negative 681 pIm writing a PHP script which allows a user to upload a file via a form.  The file will be stored in a MEDIUMBLOB field of a table in a MySQL database.p  pTo do this, the content of the uploaded file needs to be read, then inserted.  Fairly trivial stuff, but Im hoping to get some thoughts about which of the following methods is bestmost reliable when dealing with files that are not just text files.p  precodefiledata  filegetcontentsFILES[file][tmpname] codepre  pversus...p  precodefilepointer  fopenFILES[file][tmpname], rb filedata  freadfilepointer, filesizeFILES[file][tmpname] or use FILES[file][size] instead of filesize codepre  pBoth filegetcontents and fopenfread are binary safe, while fopen allows me to open the file in binary mode...  Im wondering if that will make a difference.p  pLastly, most scripts will sanitise the file data before inserting  many use addslashes, but I would use the mysqlis realescapestring method...p  pHowever, I notice that none of the examples Ive viewed strip the escape characters when retrieving the data e.g. the download script retrieves the data from the database, sends headers then just echoes the data without any kind of stripslashes...p  pIs this a problem, or am I missing somethingp  pCheers, Gregp
Negative 681 pI have a backgroundWorker thread running.

And when the task is done I call ProgressChanged is called and finally RunWorkerCompleted is also called. BUT when I minimize the app in middle, the components like Labels arent changed. Button text is changed, but it hangsstucks  button doesnt work any longer. MY point is  If app is minimized during executing DoWork, then when ProgresChanged amp RunCompleted is called or not. If called then why certain components arent changed. NOTE If I dont minimize in middle, then everything works perfectly fine.p

Each array is an array of dictionary objects, but the structure of each dictionary object is different. So one array contains elements that each contain a list of, say, 12 keysvalues. The other array has elements that contain a list of, say 15 keysvalues. Some of the keysvalues might be the same, but not necessarily in the same order, and not necessarily formatted the same e.g., the date field is formatted differently in each array. p  pWhat I need to do eventually is combine them, and sort on one common key  the date field. p  pI dont think an array can have elements with different structures across individual elements, can it Ive never used a language that will do this, although I ask because I wouldnt be surprised if objectivec could.  p  pAnyway, I have been reading Apples documentation, and there are a lot of great sorting and merging algorithms already provided. But I could use some help deciding on what approach to use. p  pThe fact is, I only need about 5 fields, so I feel like I want to create a third array of dictionaries with the structure I want, and then transfer all items into it, then sort after. But where do I startp  pIf anyone has any experience with this Id appreciate some guidance. p

Negative 681 pthis a question I always wanted to ask. When I am running an iOS application in Profiler looking for allocation issues, I found out that NSManagedObject stays in memory long after they have been used and displayed, and the UIViewController who recall has been deallocated. Of course when the UIViewController is allocated again, the number is not increasing, suggesting that theres no leak, and theres some kind of object reuse by CoreData.p  pIf I have a MyManagedObject class which has been given mobjc as name, then in profiler I can see an increasing number ofp  blockquote   pMyManagedObjectmobjcp blockquote  pthe number may vary, and for small amount of data, for example 100 objects in sqllite, it grows to that limit and stays there. p  pBut it also seems that sometimes during the application lifecycle the objects are deallocated, so I suppose that CoreData itself is doing some kind of memory optimizations. It also seems that not the whole object is retained, but rather the fault of it please forgive my english   because of the small live byte size. Even tough a lot of fault objects would also occupy memory.p  pBut at this point I would like some confirmationp  ul liis CoreData really managing and optimizing object in memory li liis there anything I can do for helping my application to retain less object as possible li lirelated to the point above, do I really need to take care of this issue or not li lido you have some link, possibly by Apple, where this specific subject is explained li ul  pmaybe it is relevant, the app I used for testing rely on ARC and iOS 5.1.p  pthanksp

Negative 681 pMy designer works on Illustrator and exports all the resources for mdpi, hdpi and xhdpi and also for iOS res with a script. For buttons and streachables images, Im looking for the best solution to generate the 9patches.p  pUntil now, I was using the draw9patch soft in the SDK to generate the 9patches. It still works, but seriously, I hope that there is a better way. If in my project I have 20 buttons, with 3 or 4 states, and in 3 density types, I cant imagine the hours that this solution will require.p  pA solution would be to use the Asset Studio tool, but I dont want to provide my xhdpi file, and get poorly generated images for the other density folders. My goal is to get pixel perfect 9patches for each density.p  pWe also tried to use SVG files for stretchable images, but it seems that Asset Studio doesnt accept them.p  pIf my designer tries to make the 9patch directly in Illustrator, he cant use the script to export, because the 1 px line will be scaled too, and wont measure 1px anymore.p  pSo is there a solution to make 9patches, without losing image quality, and without spending ten hours for it p

Negative 681 pIve been thinking, perhaps for too long. At the moment, I have an abstract base class called Renderer, it has virtual methods to render and register objects I have to register objects to allocate memory for VBOs.p  pHowever, Im not sure if I should keep it like that, Im thinking I should keep the base abstract class. I just wouldnt create another Renderer that will render my objects with another API, other than OpenGL. So in other words, I wont use Direct3D or any other graphics API except for OpenGL.p  pBut I may have multiple implementations of the OpenGL renderer, for example one for OpenGL ES and normal OpenGL if they vary that much, that is.p  pIf I were to use another API, such as Direct3D, creating the context would probably be the main concern for me... Im just not sure how I would do it in a neat way.p  pSorry if this doesnt make any sense, I think Ive been thinking for way too long.p

The textfields come from a custom class that extends codeJTextFieldcode and uses an overriden codepaintComponentcode method along with a codeMouseListenercode, so that when mouse enters on a textfield area the gradient color slightly changes and changes back again when mouse leaves the textfield.p  pThe problem is that the gradient color change does not perform very well when those textfields are inside a panel with a TitledBorder which by the way is a compound border. I mean that they do not respond fast enough, but they respond well when theyre not in such a panel Ive tested this.p  pI thought that the problem is the border itself, so I tried to override the codeTitledBordercodes codepaintBordercode method where I added a print statement whenever this method is called to draw the border... and it seems that every time the mouse enters a textfields area and the gradient color changes the codeTitledBordercode is painted again. If I quickly move the mouse pointer across all the textfields theyre just 4 of them then the textfields are painted again which is normal but the compound codeTitledBordercode is also painted every time and I guess that this causes the performance issue.p  pMy question is simple, is there any way that I can tell Java NOT to paint again the panels codeTitledBordercode every time that the mouse moves on the panels inner components p  pI understand that this may cause problems sometimes, for example if I had a small titledbordered panel with a combobox if I clicked on that combobox, the popup menu could hide part of the panels border provided that the combobox is close to the borders bottom side, so when the popup menu itself is hidden again the border should be painted again or else it would leave a blank area at the space where the popup menu and the border overlapped.p  pBut in the previous case where the panel has only textfields and there is no need that the border should be painted again when the mouse moves at the panels area, is it acceptable to prevent codepaintComponentcode to be called and if yes, how or should I try something completely different that I didnt think of  sorry Im not very experienced.p  pI can provide code of the gradient textfields codepaintComponentcode method and the change that occurs on codemouseEnteredcode but I thought that the problems cause is clear and my assumption of why it occurs is right correct me if Im wrong...p  pEDITp  pOk while going through my custom classes trying to make the sscce I discovered my very stupid mistake. Instead of the standard TitledBorder I was using a CustomTitledBorder class thatp  p1 eliminated the 2 extra pixels added at the right side of the titled border 2 used a compound border and different font palatino bold.p  pThe problem was that the palatino font was not stored in memory but was read from the disk emeveryem time the constructor of my custom class was called. So it was also called every time paintBorder was called. And so it was called every time the mouse moved over a textfield in the panel with the above border. This was very stupid, Im sorry about this and I was trying to figure out the performance problem for a day and more.p  pThis does not answer my question though on how to avoid paintBorder to be executed every time the mouse is over a textfield, but it is not needed anymore and Im not really sure if it is acceptable anyway.p

Negative 681 pYou can set a breakpoint on the closing codecode of a Scala method, but its pointless to do so because it wont be hit, apparently.p  pI would still like to set it there. So I thought, how about I put in a noop before that line, and set a breakpoint on thatp  pBut since evidently Eclipse is not warning me when I try to set a breakpoint that will never be hit because there is no code there, I therefore cant rely on Eclipse telling me if a noop has been optimised out particularly as Im not even using the same version of Scala to run the code as the Eclipse Scala plugin is using.p  pSo is there a short nooperation statement or expression that I can use here which is emguaranteed not to be optimised away by the Scala compiler, in all circumstancesem  and guaranteed not to be optimised away by a JIT in a way that prevents a breakpoint on it being hit I guess it has to be an expression rather than a statement in my case, because this method returns a useful value, not codeUnitcode.p

Negative 681 pIm trying to build an implementation of the codeIHttpControllerActivatorcode interface for with with StructureMap, so that I can resolve a dependency of a controller which takes a dependency on the codeHttpRequestMessagecode being processed in the MVC Web API pipeline.p  pMy implementation of codeCreatecode is as followsp  precodepublic IHttpController Create     HttpRequestMessage request,     HttpControllerDescriptor controllerDescriptor,     Type controllerType      return IHttpControllerthis.Container         .Withrequest         .WithcontrollerDescriptor         .GetInstancecontrollerType  codepre  pThe codeContainercode property is a reference to the StructureMap codeIContainercode instance passed to the activator when it is constructed.p  pMy registration for the controllers uses reflection to obtain all the codeApiControllercode implementationsp  precodeforeachvar controller in this.GetType.Assembly.GetTypes     .Wheretype gt typeofApiController.IsAssignableFromtype     this.Forcontroller.Usecontroller  codepre  pUsing the debugger, I checked that initialises the controller instances and passes in their dependencies. However, when the codeExecuteAsynccode method is called on the controller, an exception is thrownp  blockquote   pCannot reuse an ApiController instance. ApiController has to be constructed per incoming message. Check your custom IHttpControllerActivator and make sure that it will not manufacture the same instance.p blockquote  pAfter some digging and experimentation I discovered this is due to a check performed at the start of codeExecuteAsynccode which checks the codeRequestcode property of the codeApiControllercode to see if it has been assigned a value. If the property has a nonnull value, it infers that the controller has already been used to process a request and aborts the operation.p  pFurther to this, I verified that StructureMap attempted to use its setterinjection behaviour when composing the controller and is responsible for codeRequestcode having a nonnull value.p  pIn my registry, I havent configured any setterinjection, so Im confused as to why its being invoked here. A poke around the StructureMap API hasnt yielded any obvious answers as to how I could change the behaviour exhibited.p  pAm I invoking StructureMap incorrectly Is there a configuration setting I can leverage to say never ever assign a property valuep

Negative 681 pFor a class subject, I must implement a class that looks for a pattern in a set of chars that the class receives in a chronological order. Each character the class receives has a particular source a planete, identified by an int ID.p  pWe have to implement the data structure ourselves, and so I implemented a String List where I store all these characters in a chronological order.p  pThe problem is that the pattern must be matched for characters coming from the same planete source, so pattern matching must be made on each source.p  pI tried to use famous pattern matching algorithms like Rabin Karp by browsing the whole list and only taking into account the currently browsed source, and then doing this for all the sources, but the performances are really lame, even worse than a naive but synchronous solution.p  pDo you have any idea about which algorithm could be more efficient in that case  letting me use each character Im browsing, even if this implies storing the actual search state of that source somewhere, like we did for the naive implementationp  pP.S The IDs are finite from 1 to 128 but the number of chars can go up to 10p  pstrongEDITstrong Here are some details that will hopefully clarify things.p  pcodeIntlFindercode, my class,can receive characters or array of characters by a method codeAddchar pszData, int nSourcecode Hence, each character is coupled with a Source ID. The pair character, source is stored in a StringList codeComListcode in chronological order of their addition.p  pFor the pattern to be present in my class, it must be present for THE SAME SOURCE.p  pExamplep  pIf Im looking for the pattern SAYKOUKp  pstrongSstrong, 1 strongAstrong, 1 strongYstrong, 1 strongKstrong, 1 Z, 2 S, 3 strongOstrong, 1 strongUstrong, 1 strongKstrong, 1  is OK p  pstrongSstrong, 1 strongAstrong, 1 strongYstrong, 1 K, 2 O, 3 U, 1 K, 4  is not OK.p  pThis is problametic because if I only consider one source ranging from 1 to 128 and browse the whole list each time, my pattern searching method is emREALLYem slow. And I cant manage with any of these algorithms to take into account the characters of the different sources and know whenever I met my pattern with any of them p

Negative 681 pI have a class that needs to provide a fast classification service.  For example, I want to write code like classifyAc Kd Kh 3c 3s that quickly returns TWOPAIR.

In the interest of time I want to parallelize this precomputation.  HOWEVER, attempting to use classifySlowly from a 2nd thread creates a deadlock.  p  precodepublic class Classifcation Service    enum CLASS TYPEA, TYPEB, ...    static CLASS[] preComputedClassLookUpTable    static      preComputedClassLookUpTable  constructLookUpTableInParallel       Note using this method from with constructLookUpTableInParallel causes deadlock   private static CLASS classifySlowlyObject classifyMe      do time intensive work to classify the input       uses no other methods from this class     return classification       public static CLASS classifyObject classifyMe      use the lookup table to do a quick classification     return classification        codepre  pSo my question is  Is there a way to precompute this lookup table IN PARALLEL from within the static initalizer blockp  pThe only poor alternative I see is to switch fromp  precodepreComputedClassLookUpTable  constructLookUpTableInParallel codepre  pTop  precodepreComputeClassLookUpTable  loadLookUpTableFromFile ifpreComputedClassLookUpTable  null    System.out.printlnWARNING  Construction incomplete, Must call computeAndSaveLookUpTableFile  codepre  hr  pI thought this would be too much but here is the implementation of constructLookUpTableInParallelp  precodeprivate static CLASS[] constructLookUpTableInParallel     build a collection of Runnables by iterating over all possible input Objects   wrap each possible input in an anonymous Runnable that calls classifySlowly.    submit the collection of Runnables to a new ExecutorService   process runnables...   shutdown executor service        codepre  pEND OF POORLY WORDED ORIGINAL QUESTION p  pThe solution that works somewhat cleanly is splitting the classifySlowlyObject classifyMe and classifyObject classifyMe methods into two different classes.  p  pThis will allow the first class that contains public static CLASS classifySlowlyObject classifyMe to be fully loaded by the time the second class that contains public static CLASS classifyQuicklyObject classifyMe needs to use the classifySlowly method.

How can I do that Moreover, the rotated images should be aspect fill i.e. there should be no black margins at the sides of the rotated images.p  pP.S. I want to rotate UIImage, not UIImageView as there are some ways available to rotate UIImageView but they dont meet my requirements.p

Negative 681 pAlright, this is a pretty simple.. maybe even stupid question.  But I have been trying for a pretty long time to get this working properly and nothing has worked.

Negative 681 pThis is a problem with very serious ramifications, so I am posting to find out if anyone else has encountered thisp  pI am running ASP.NET 3.5 on VS2008 using VB, under WinXP. I use a complex MySQL database. I have created a complex Web App that requires tracking numerous session variables, each of which represents an object, not a simple data type.p  pSituation One of my pages is used to edit events reallife events, such as meetings, retrieved from a database using a unique identifier strongintEventIDstrong. After editing the event, the user clicks a Save button which calls a Save routine UPDATEs the DB. Very normal stuff, rightp  pYesterday, the Save routine stopped working. After a thorough examination, it became clear that the unique identifier strongintEventIDstrong had been reset to 0 between the rendering of the page and the initialization of the PostBack. To rephrase, strong1 variable in a complex object was reset to 0 between the clicking of a button and the PreInit event of the PostBackstrong. Yes, of course, I examined every line of code on the page. The variable was not changed by any line of code on the page.p  pAfter long diagnosis, I found the culprit a single line of code on a different page Web Form. Yes, an unrelated page Whats more, while I could stop the execution of that command by placing an Exit Sub command before it, no other code on the other page would execute For example, if I placed a Response.Redirect command before the offending line, it would stop execution of the line, but would not redirect as requested p  pstrongSummary one Web form, at some point before the PreInit event but only during PostBack, called a single line of code from a different Web Form.strong No amount of recompiling or rebooting could change that.p  pHas anyone else experienced thisp

Negative 681 pThis is a neat issue, and not a tell me what code works, but rather a how do I logically handle this situation question.p  pI have, in short, video  audio coming in a from an IP camera via RTSP.p  pThe video and audio are being decoded and recorded framebyframe to a single mp4 container, by separate threads shown below.p  pThe problem is video and audio becoming progressively more out of sync over time, due to lack of precision with the TimeSpan end time and start times for each video frame.p  pIt should be a duration of 1  framerate  0.0333667000333667 for each video frame, but its using even with the FromTicks method, start time  0.0 and end time of 0.0333667 for the first frame.p  pI can adjust the video decoder framerate value from 29.97 its pulling that in from the cameras settings declared framerate, resulting in either video that precedes the audio, or lags after the audiothis is simply making each video mediaBuffer.StartTime and mediaBuffer.EndTime either too early or too late, in comparison to the audio.p  pOver time, the miniscule decimal truncation ends up making the video and audio out of syncthe longer the recording, the more out of sync the two tracks get.p  pI dont really understand why this is happening, because, rounding error shouldnt logically matter.p  pEven if I only had a precision of 1 second, Id only write a video frame each second, and its placement in the timeline would be roughly where it should be  1 second, and that should make every progressive frame the same  1 second to where it should be, not adding up progressively more misplacement. Im imagining this would look like for each framep  p[lt 1 second  exact frame time expected lt 1s ]  recorded frame time p  pAm I missing something herep  pIm not doing new frame start time  last frame end time, new frame end time  new frame start time  1  framerateIm actually doing new frame start time  frame index  1  framerate, new frame end time  frame index  framerate.p  pThat is, Im calculating the frame start and end times based on the expected time they should have frame time  frame position  framerate.p  pWhat my code is doing is thisp  ptime expected  time expected  time expected frame time         frame time         frame time p  pI understand the issue mathematically, I just dont understand why decimal truncation is proving such a problem, or logically know what the best solution is to fix it.p  pIf I implement something that says every x frames, use 1  framerate  some amount to make up for all the missing time, will that be possible to have frames match where they should be, or just result in messy videop  precode    public void AudioDecoderThreadProc              TimeSpan current  TimeSpan.FromSeconds0.0          while IsRunning                      RTPFrame nextFrame  jitter.FindCompleteFrame              if nextFrame  null                              System.Threading.Thread.Sleep20                 continue                           while nextFrame.PacketCount gt 0 ampamp IsRunning                              RTPPacket p  nextFrame.GetNextPacket                  if sub.ti.MediaCapability.Codec  Codec.G711A  sub.ti.MediaCapability.Codec  Codec.G711U                                      MediaBufferltbytegt mediaBuffer  new MediaBufferltbytegtp.DataPointer, 0, intp.DataSize                     mediaBuffer.StartTime  current                     mediaBuffer.EndTime  current.AddTimeSpan.FromSecondsp.DataSize  doubleaudioDecoder.SampleRate                      current  mediaBuffer.EndTime                      if SaveToFile  true                                              WriteMp4DatamediaBuffer                                                                       public void VideoDecoderThreadProc              byte[] totalFrame  null          TimeSpan current  TimeSpan.FromSeconds0.0         TimeSpan videoFrame  TimeSpan.FromTicks3336670         long frameIndex  1          while IsRunning                      if completedFrames.Count gt 50                              System.Threading.Thread.Sleep20                 continue                           RTPFrame nextFrame  jitter.FindCompleteFrame              if nextFrame  null                              System.Threading.Thread.Sleep20                 continue                           if nextFrame.HasSequenceGaps  true                              continue                           totalFrame  new byte[nextFrame.TotalPayloadSize  2]             int offset  0              while nextFrame.PacketCount gt 0                              byte[] fragFrame  nextFrame.GetAssembledFrame                  if fragFrame  null                                      fragFrame.CopyTototalFrame, offset                     offset  fragFrame.Length                                            MediaBufferltbytegt mediaBuffer  new MediaBufferltbytegt                 totalFrame,                 0,                 offset,                 TimeSpan.FromTicksConvert.ToInt64frameIndex  1  mp4TrackInfo.Video.Framerate  10000000,                 TimeSpan.FromTicksConvert.ToInt64frameIndex  mp4TrackInfo.Video.Framerate  10000000              if SaveToFile  true                              WriteMp4DatamediaBuffer                           lock completedFrames                              completedFrames.AddmediaBuffer                           frameIndex               codepre

Negative 681 pOk I have been working on a class to iterate through all nodes in an html doc and return the data that I need. This is very simple and I have achieved this in Bash but now I am trying to port the same to C. p  pI started with the example on the libxml site but I have stepped through this function node by node and I cant understand how it is working.p  pHere is the functionp  precode    static void printelementnamesxmlNode  anode      xmlNode curnode  NULL      for curnode  anode curnode curnode  curnodegtnext          if curnodegttype  XMLELEMENTNODE              printfnode type Element, name sn, curnodegtname                   printelementnamescurnodegtchildren       codepre  pSo basically, this function takes a node assigns it to a pointer, and starts to loop through all sibling nodes, but if the current node has children, it calls the function and start over on that child node. This is all very understandable. p  pSo it drives down the doc structure, but how does it navigate back up the structure p  pDoes xmlNodechildren return the next parent node when it is found NULL As far as I can tell, this is not true, but I just cant figure out how this is working.p  pI successfully created a class to do what I want, but it is so much more complex than this and about 10 lines longer. I actually had to check if the next node was null and either navigate down if it has children or navigate back up and to the next node if it didnt. p  pThis example is much simpler and I would like to understand how to make my code better.p

Negative 681 pThis is the first time Im using BizTalk for crossmachine, asynchronous, reliable communication.br I would like to know is there a way to directly send messages from one machine to BizTalk queue or I have to use local MSMQ which in turn sends messages to BizTalkp  pIn C, is there a binding that is used in order to send messages to BizTalk queuesbr For MSMQ I know that there is NetMsmqBinding. p  pCheersp  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pSince Ive introduced a bit of confusion, Ill try to explain a bit and please correct me if Im wrong.br As far as I know, ESBs implement the concept of queues or message channels that can be used for reliable, asynchronous communication messaging in short. Now, Im having difficulty placing BizTalk into this concept. There are dozens of interpretation of ESB concept and same number of opinions on if BizTalk is an ESB, like Sonic or TIBCO...br Now, as far as I know, for example in TIBCO which implements JMS API, there are no queues or queueing services on local client machine e.g. MSMQ, but they are present and configured on TIBCO ESB and from client app I use JMS API to send messages to these queues.br So when I want to communicate via BizTalk with apps on different machines and I want to use messaging, Ill be using MSMQ on local machine and MSMQ will transfer these messages to BizTalk and other apps downstreambr Also, where should I configure the communication between local MSMQ and BizTalk Should I configure BizTalk to listen to a given MSMQ for new messages or there is some configuration that should take place on MSMQ itself, as wellp

Negative 681 pI need to solve many times, for lots of data, alongside a bunch of other things what I think boils down to a a hrefhttpwww.stanford.eduboydpaperssocp.html relnofollowsecond order cone programa.

The trouble is that everything else around this is happening in R, and it would be quite a nuisance to have to port it over to Matlab. So is doing this in R viable, and if so howp  pThis really boils down to two separate questionsp  p1 Are there any good R resources for this As far as I can tell from the a hrefhttpcran.rproject.orgwebviewsOptimization.html relnofollowCRAN task pagea, the SOCP package options are a hrefhttpcran.rproject.orgwebpackagesCLSOCPindex.html relnofollowCLSCOPa and a hrefhttpcran.rproject.orgwebpackagesDWDindex.html relnofollowDWDa, which includes an SOCP solver as an adjunct to its classifier. Both have similar but fairly opaque interfaces and are a bit thin on documentation and examples, which brings us top  p2 Whats the best way of representing the above problem in the constraint block format used by these packages The CVX syntax above hides a lot of tedious mucking about with extra variables and such, and I can just see myself spending emweeksem trying to get this right, so any tips or pointers to nudge me in the right direction would be very welcome...p

Negative 681 pFirstly, Im new to this project and its original development was outsourced. And boy, the project is a mess of workarounds and nonDrupal implementations for nearly everything. This project is impossible to upgrade without significant work across every custom module. Where the developers couldve used CCK to handle 95 of the work they did they added many tables to the database and used Drupal forms to populate them instead.p  pOur client wants a new gallery management interface to one of these special tables. We need a way to have a repeating fieldset likep  precodegallery[0][image]  can be either link or url gallery[0][caption] codepre  pDrupal 6 doesnt support repeating fields out of the box, so it looks like I have to either install a module, or come up with a juryrigged solution myself. But from what Ive seen of Drupal it looks like I should be able to implement this with a regular form and some Javascript, if I do it right.p  precode Just an example, this isnt working code. index  0  foreach gallery as id gt data    form[gallery][index][id]  array     type  gt hidden,     value gt id,       form[gallery][index][image]  array     type gt upload,       form[gallery][index][caption]  array     type gt textbox,     value gt data[caption]       form[gallery][index][delete]  array    index  1  codepre  pYet how could I tie a form similar to this to a Javascript Add more link that ties into the form state And how do I handle the result of such form inputp

Negative 681 pSuppose that at a point in time, you have a collection of codeNcode numbers and know the median element codeMcode. Now, youre given a new value, codeXcode, and so you may need to update codeMcode. Or rather, you will need to, assuming the numbers youre dealing with are all unique. Also, all the samples are received serially, so theres no issues with concurrency.p  pCalculating the new mean is straightforward take the old mean, add codeXcode, multiply by codeNcode, and divide by codeN  1code. This is clear from inspecting how the average of N elements is defined. Im not too worried about numerics, for the moment.p  pMy question is can anyone suggest a creativenovel or perhaps, provablyoptimal approach the problem of updating the median Ill provide an example simple idea of my own design below, with a bit of analysisp  pIn this sample, Ill use a codestdforwardlistcode, since C11 is where I encountered this most recently. Without loss of generality, Im going to assume youre going about this the right way maintaining an ordered list of the elements type Ts encountered thus far, codestdforwardlistltTgt sortedcode When  codeT xcode appears, simply fold it into place usingp  precodesorted.mergestdforwardlistltTgt  x  codepre  pBy the way, Im curious if anyone has a better more efficientelegant method for this. Gripes welcome.p  pSo, codeXcode is now part of codesortedcode, and heres my idea, in a nutshellp  precodeauto it  sorted.begin, itend  sorted.end typename stdforwardlistltTgtsizetype count  stddistanceit, itend for const auto ampe  sorted      if it  itend  it  itend          M  count  2  e  e  M  2         break      else  it   codepre  pThe nice if not somewhat hard to see thing that happens here is that since you move the iterator forward twice and safely, I might add, though at the price of two comparisons for each element, when codeendcode is reached, well be at the proper median value. If theres an odd number of elements, codeMcode is just that sample, if not, its just the average of this element and the old pushedout median. Because odd and even numbers alternate, either the old or new codeMcode will actually be in the collection. This reasoning is sound, yesp  pYou neednt comment on my O3n method if you think its trashyours is much better Im just suggesting it as a starting point.p

Does Pig provide an interface that would allow me to call a java method that will take in a set of keys and return a set bag or map of answers that can be joined or somehow assigned to the Tuple in the Pig relationp  pThanks in advance for your helpp

fields i.e. ascending or descending as a prefix or suffix of the 2dsphere index field and that If the sort document is a subset of a compound index and starts from the beginning of the index, MongoDB can use the index to both retrieve and sort the query results.p  pWhat am I missingp  pThanks in advancep

Do I need to register my custom attribute classes in the web.config somewhere  A comment on this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions16100300aspnetmvccustomvalidationbydataannonation16100455this answera seems to be asking the same thing.p  pFYI the reason Im creating my own attributes is because I want to retrieve the field display names and validation messages from Sitecore and dont really want to go down the route of creating a class with a ton of static methods to represent each text property, which is what Id have to do if I were to use p  precodepublic class MyModel      [DisplayNameSome Property]     [RequiredErrorMessageResourceNameSomePropertyRequired, ErrorMessageResourceTypetypeofMyResourceClass]     public string SomeProperty get set    public class MyResourceClass      public static string SomePropertyRequired              get   extract field from sitecore item             for each new field validator, I would need to add an additional      property to retrieve the corresponding validation message  codepre

Negative 681 pHeres the whole issue.  Im trying to read the IP address of a given adapter on a computer, decrement the last digit by 1, and add the new IP address as a route.  I so far have managed to extract the IP address in the following mannerp  precodenetsh interface ip show config name15 findstr IP Adress gt Cip.txt for f tokens2 delims F in cip.txt do echo F gt cipstripped.txt for f tokens2 delims1 F in Cipstripped.txt do echo 1F gtcipdigits.txt codepre  pthis gets me a file that has the IP address in it, but also blank spaces and possibly a carriage return at the end of the line.  Then I runp  precodefor f tokens4 delims. F in Cipdigits.txt do echo F gtclastdig.txt codepre  pthis gets me a file that has just the last digit in it, but also seems to have extra characters..  At that point, when I try to runp  precodefor f delims f in clastdig.txt DO Set countf echo count  set a count1    echo count  echo countgt Cdecdigit.txt codepre  pIt fails out because Im guessing, it is loading the 6 and the blank characters etc from the file at which point it cant decrement the count variable as its not just a numeric value.. Ive gotten it to return just the digit originally read in.. or it will return echo off or various other things depending on what I try.. p  pWhat Im looking for is either just enough code to get just the number loaded and decremented, or if you can think of a better way to extract and change the IP address without all the steps Im using.. that would work as well.. Im also not overly familiar with any of the code listed above having simply cribbed it from other answers on there.. so maybe Im just missing something simple as none of it make as whole lot of sense to me.p

Negative 681 pWe are using Liferay Portal 6.0, and the portlets are Primefaces 3.4, JSF 2.1, We support having more than one browser tab opened for the same user, and each tab can have up to 15 portlets at a time, each portlet is displaying a JSF page codeViewScopedBeancode using codeiframecode.p  pThe problem is that the opened JSF pages inside a codeiframecode inside a portlet dont know when their portlets get closed or when the whole browser tab gets closed, So they stay in memory until session times out. And this is causing a major problem in server memory leading to complete failure. p  pMy questions are How can I have the list of opened pages views from server side and how can I also close them I know that a codeViewScopedBeancode gets destroyed when it is redirected to another page a dummy page as a workaround, so can I redirect each page from the list If I can have it from server sidep  pThank you very much in advance.p

Negative 681 pI have a Webapp that is built on top of the Play framework and Scala. It is about presenting the user with a set of questions with each question having a set of answers. Some of the questions have radio button types an answers and some have check boxes as answers. When the user clicks start test, I call the controller, fetch the list of questions with its answers and return the result as a case class to the view template. I now need to maintain the state of the test as the user answers each question. He can go previous, next and I need to keep track of all the questions that he answered. p  pComing from a Java EE background, I thought I can store the case class in the session and manipulate it in my controller. But that unfortunately does not look like that as the Play frameworks session is a key value pair of String, String and not a String, Object. Im now stuck with my app and since my experience with the Play framework is limited, I would like to ask for suggestions.p

Negative 681 pIn most of the discussions Ive read, it indicates that making a property atomic does not guarantee it to be threadsafe, it just guarantees that the value returned wont be garbage as a result of one object writing to it and another trying to read it at the same time.p  pI understand this isnt threadsafe as a third object could be writing it and while the object accessing it wouldnt get garbage back, its not entirely certain which value it will get back as multiple objects are writing to it at the same time, and it may get any of their values.p  pSo when we say it wont return garbage, would garbage be in the sense that if an object was nonatomic and an object tried to access it while another was writing to it, it might get the result back midwrite, and only get a partial, incomplete version of the change brought about by the write Is this what garbage means in this sense, and what atomic properties help to preventp

Negative 681 pIm building a ratelimiting decorator in codeflaskcode using coderediscode stores that will recognize different limits on different endpoints. I realize there are a number of ratelimiting decorators out there, but my use case is different enough that it made sense to roll my own.p  pBasically the issue Im having is ensuring that the keys I store in redis are classspecific.

Negative 681 pThis is the CSortedList.cpp file, where Im having trouble doing what I want to do.

by the professor for this assignment, and I dont think it needs to be changed but I could be wrong. p  pThe RemoveItem function should do exactly what it says  if I were to remove an item from the list, it should be moving the items inside the array to the front, with the help of the MoveListItem function. p  pFinally, per the directions, our professor gave us this function  GetTargetIndex, but

Negative 681 pWere using Apache FOP 1.1 with XSLT to generate a PDF for printing. Our software is creating the XML correctly, and passing this directly to the FOP transformer.

Negative 681 pIm working on a web app where Ehcache is deployed. This app is load balanced between multiple servers. The app is installed on each server and when a user accesses the app heshe is redirected to one of the load balanced servers.p  pIs my understanding of the following correct If a user makes a request for a key and its annotated with codeCacheablecode a check is made for the value in the Ehcache store. If the key is in the store then its value is returned from Ehcache, if the key is not in the store then the key and its value is added to the store and its value is returned. If one of the load balanced servers becomes unavailable and the user requests a value which has already been cached in the nowunavailable server then this new value will be added to the cache store and returned to the user as described above. p  pThere is no risk of the user requesting a key which is not available, is therep

Negative 681 pWhilst reading a a hrefhttpwww.amazon.co.ukGamePhysicsEngineDevelopmentCommercialGradeebookdpB00AQNVXFWbooka about physics engine development recently, I came across a design decision which I have never even considered before. This relates to the way the raw bytes in memory are addressed by the CPU.p  pConsider the following classp  precodeclass Foo      public         float x         float y         float z           Constructors and Methods       private         float padding  codepre  pThe author claims that the padding, increasing the size of the object to a quadword in x86 architecture, results in a noticeable benefit to performance. This is because 4 words sit more emcleanlyem in memory than 3, what does this mean Padding out an object with redundant data to increase performance seems pretty paradoxical to me.p  pThis also begs another question, what about objects that are 1 or 2 words in size If my class is something likep  precodeclass Bar      public         float x         float y           Constructors and Methods       private          padding    codepre  pShould I add padding to this class so that it sits more emcleanlyem in memoryp

Negative 681 pIm very new angular and while I like it so far, I have run into a little problem with my first real case. I have a .json file of staff members information. I also have a global search run by Googles Search Appliance that just goes through pages. Ideally when a user searches for a key term if it matches any names in my .json file I would like to display their info a link to their full profile would also come from the .json separate from the search results. p  pSo far I have been able to display the .json on the page using ngrepeat and sortlimit the quantity that get displayed.

Negative 681 pI have a Json file which is 1 Terabytes in size. Each codeJson Objectcode is a text with 500600 words. There are 50 million Json objects.p  pNow this is what I have to do with this Json file. I need to insert 200300 words and a percentage value into a web page. Once this is done, the web application will read the entire Json file checking whether the inserted words are available in any Json object, and what is the percentage of the availability. If the availability percentage is higher than the percentage I inserted then this application will also keep track of words available in Json Object compared to the input list and words missing in Json Object compared to the input list.p  pI felt reading 1TB is too big, so I did a trick. I converted the text in every codeJson Objectcode into hash this hash represents any word with 3 characters and saved it into a text file. Now the hash in every new line of this text file represents the text in that Particular Json Object. This text file is 120GB big. 50 Million lines.p  pMy problem is that reading and performing the above job is still harder. It takes hours of time to complete Why Because the application read every line in this Hash, search which words are available and which words are not. So this checking algorithms are running for 50 million timesp  pIs there anyway I can reduce the time of this operation and do it within few seconds I know applications in chemistry and genetic medicine does the exact same thing within seconds I am open to all the solutions, whether it is a Big data solution, data mining or a simple fix, whatever.

This method is more intelligent but has more tables.pli lipHave an codeimagecode table and another table name codeEntityTypecode that goes between.pli ol  pcodeEntityTypecode table has an codeEntityTypeIdcode column and a codenamecode and has three records code1,EntityAcode, code2,EntityBcode, code3,EntityCcode.p  pThen in codeimagecode tablep  pIf I save a record for codeEntityAcode the record in codeimagecode table would be this code1,1,namecodep  pFirst column is codeImageIdcode, second one is codeEntityTypeIdcode and the third one is codeimages filenamecode.p  pIf I save a record for codeEntityBcode the record in codeimagecode table would be this code2,2,namecodep  pAnd if I save a record for codeEntityAcode the record in codeimagecode table would be this code3,3,namecodep  pIn this method the number of tables would decrease but the queries would be longer.p  pWhich one is optimised or any other way...p
Negative 681 pSo ive recently decided to up my game and try to learn how to use the fabled Eclipse IDE. So far so good, I love it for many reasons, but ive encountered one simple issue.p  pI added an image to a JLabel using the codeImageIconcode format like I used to when I was learning Java using the JGRASP IDE, only the problem is, the image wont display at all in Eclipse. There is just an empty panel. When I switch over to JGRASP, despite the fact that the image is far too large for the display area, it definitely displays at least partially, unlike in Eclipse. p  pMy question is, why could this be I have the .jpg file located in the src folder of my project, so that isnt the issueI used the same folder when I loaded the project into JGRASP. Do I need to define a pathway when using Eclipse or is there something else I could be missing p  pAnyways, here is my code so far, bare bones as it is.

Negative 681 pIm trying to insert a value into a string, but I am having troubles.

However, when I introduce a second power an equation like code552552code, it works the first time through evaluating to code525552code, but not the second. When it evaluates the first time round and exits the calculating method after updating the equation, the while loop will force it reexecute the method. The second time through the method acts just like the first time, and assumes that the equation is still code552552code, when in actual fact the equation is code525552code.p  pIve no idea how or why the equation is not updating. Any help will be greatly appreciated.p  pp  pAPOLOGIES, I just realised that in my loop i had a reference to my original equation which was why this problem was happening.

Negative 681 pI would like to get an opinion of what would be the best approach how to tackle my problem. I have some ideas but they are far from perfect in my opinion and maybe someone can suggest a nice and clean way how to do this.p  pThe picture below illustrates my general code structure img srchttpi.stack.imgur.com3ai16.png altenter image description herep  pI have a communications module that writes data to an array consisting of data bytes. And i want to keep the structure there as it is, because then it is a flexible fully GUI independent solution. Just to explain my reason behind this further  the data structure represents a physical memory of an external hardware unit MCU.p  pAfter that I need to split up that data into properties. Meaning that I have several properties that are bound to elements in GUI giving them data. Thus I want each property take data from specific region in array as example index 100104.p  pThe problematic part for me is how to bind these properties to the array in the mentioned way The binding needs to be two way.p

Negative 681 pIm playing a bit with SignalR and relating it back to some previous PubSub work.  In it, we have a Base Event with a couple of mandatory properties and then several Derived Events for specific payloads.p  pWith SignalR, it appears that I need to define a hub based on each of the derived events as Send is going to deal with a specific type.  For example, if I create a hub for the base class I can send any of the derived types or the base type without error but I always get back a base type losing any of the derived types properties.p  pSeems my choices are a hub for each type or putting the derived properties in some type of blob to be parsed out by the receiver.p  pHow far off is my thinkingp

Negative 681 pIve been racking my brain over this for a few days now, and being fairly new to back end stuff, I havent managed to come up with a table structure that works. What Im trying to do is create a wish list feature which allows users to save a course to their profile for later. Originally, I created three fields in my users table, named savedcourse1, savedcourse2 and savedcourse3. I then tried to come up with a phpsql code that when a user clicks the wish list button on a courses page, the id of the course is saved to the one of the saved courses fields providing that it isnt already filled, however someone pointed out to me that this would be an terrible way of doing this and it would mean my db wouldnt be normalised. So to sum my problem up, I need help with creating a table structure that would allow users to save multiple course ids to their account, then allow me to get the ids of the courses and display them in a table on their profile page. Sorry if this makes no sense, as Im finding it difficult to put it into words. p

Negative 681 pwhat is the difference between a relation of a relational database and a dimension as represented in a star diagramp  pAs part of an assignment I have a relational datawarehouse design, where most of the tables have been normalised using many to many, one to one, one to many relationship schema I think this is the right terminology please correct me if Im wrong. The next step is to draw a star diagram that could be used in a datamining environment, which I guess means a fact table that draws from different dimensions...p  pIm a little confused here because 1. any dataanalysis I could think of could be taken from the relational database, so whats the point of restructuring it and 2. If some of the tables that you want to draw data from contain foreign keys, how do you split that into dimensions.p  pfor example  I have these relationsp  precodeCourses courseid, description Modules moduleid, description Coursemodules courseid, moduleid Students studentid, address, enrollmentoption, enrollmentdate, name, surname, nationality, homelanguage, gender ... Modulegrades studentid, moduleid, assignment1, assignment1subdate, assignment2, assignment2subdate, exam, examdate, overallresult codepre  pand Id like to know how course results relate to module grades. With a relational database I would query to join a table containing students information with the module grades table. What would be the equivalent with dimensions and reports Especially as Im using multiple columns as my primary key in the grades relation..p

My problem is that the name personaname from the web api can have special characters like russian characters, greek, etc. I configured php with utf8 so i got no problem with these characters when i print them directly from the api to my php code, but when i try to insert them into the database they got corrupted into   or of. I configured the PDO with utf8 utf8unicodeci and same for the mysql. I tried using htmlentities, htmlspecialchars and utf8encode with no luck.

Negative 681 pI have a table, Job, in MySQL. It contains a lot of meta data about the job, like the status, date created etc. But also contains a lot of raw text and html in a few heavy fields. This table is also highly concurrent and cannot be taken offline for more than a few minute, at most.p  pBecause of the size of the table on disk, alters and even online alters using a Percona tool cause the table to lock and disruptions in the application.p  pI need to add a few new fields to the table but because Im effectively not able to run an alter, my thought is to create a child table JobMeta or something for the new fields.p  pThe stack is C, Fluent NHibernate, MySQL. I thought of adding a new table but then somehow mapping it back to the same Job C class, or maybe even use a view but Im not sure those are good options. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 681 pI want to make a website with a blurred Navigation Bar. The Navigation Bar is fixed and changes height when you start scrolling downwards. There are a few Menu Items inside the Navigation Bar, when you click one of the listet Items the Page start scrolling to the selected MenuPoint. I approached this with this function p  precode.fn.scrollView  function       return this.eachfunction           html, body.animate             scrollTop this.offset.top         , 1000       codepre  pNo issues so far, as I said before the height changes when you start scrolling downwards. At the top of the Page the Navigation Bar is 100px height when you scroll 100px down an animation begins and the Navigation Bar shrinks to a size of 50px. Same thing happens when you scroll to the top of the page, as soon you reached 100px the Navigation Bar gains it full height of 100px. Here is the Codep  precodevar headerDown  true scroll  document.scrollTop var headerHeight  .header.height      ifscroll lt 100         ifheaderHeight  100 ampamp headerDown  false             headerDown  true             .header.animate                 height 100px             , 400              var menuAnimation  1002  navbarHeight2             .vcenter.animate                 paddingTop menuAnimation  px             , 400               else          ifheaderHeight  50 ampamp headerDown  true             headerDown  false             .header.animate                 height 50px             , 400              var menuAnimation  502  navbarHeight2  5             .vcenter.animate                 paddingTop menuAnimation  px             , 400                  codepre  pEverything works fine so far. As you cant blur through layers like in iOS 7, I used html2Canvas a hrefhttphtml2canvas.hertzen.com relnofollowhttphtml2canvas.hertzen.coma to make a screenshot from the side and append it to the header. Than I blur this screenshot with CSS Webkit Filter. Last thing to do I tracked the scrolling from the side and set it equal to the blurred Screenshot, so it scrolls with the site and everything behind the Navbar looks like actual side blurred. p  pNow my issue, when I click on one of the Menu Items the site begins to scroll. It works perfectly but as soon the site scrolls and changes height, with the blurred Canvas inside the scroll animation is very choppy and it lags like hell. p  pIn Chrome everything works perfectly fine, but on Safari its lagging. So I started searching for the failure. I think the issue is the scroll animation and the height animation running simultan when something is actually inside the div. I think another problem is that I used overflow hidden in CSS. I read in Blogs an the solution was to use  codewebkittransform translateZ0code p  pBut it doesnt work fine the side is still a little bit laggy and doest track right with rendering on CPU. So I am asking for another solution.p  pIf you need anything more please ask for it Thanks for your help and sorry for my englishp

Negative 681 pSo, I am trying to do something ugly here, lets say its a desperate measure as I cannot have control over the runtime environment.p  pSo having that said, I run some code in an environment where I cannot have control over the classpath bad thing... Whats still worse is that the classpath has two jars, lets say productV1.jar and productV2.jar Both are exactly the same, but in different versions, so they have same classes.p  pFor some reason, in most environments the productV2.jar is loaded and the productV1.jar is left out, but in some other environment, productV1.jar is called, and it causes the program to crash.p  pWhat I want to do as a workaround is mess with the classloader to explicitly ignore productV1.jar. Ideally by overwriting some classloader funtion. I have done this with other resources like the persistence.xml file from Hibernate, but I dont want to filter based on containing classes, but rather on the jar file. Is there a wayp  pThis is only meant to work until I can do the negotiations to get rid of the offending jar...p  pEdit I will leave this question open in case there is some interesting hack. However, the issue is that everything that is in the classpth is loaded by the system classloader, and trying to switch it at runtime is not an easy task or maybe not possible at all. Only way I see is starting the process with a custom classloader, which is not what I am looking for. p
Negative 681 pIve been asked to build a web service IIS hosted which will be consumed by an ESB process, and the web service needs to run 3 queries against 3 separate databases to gather the data required.p  pOnce gathered, some advanced transformations will occur within the WS hence why we arent transforming directly within the ESB process which has limited transformation capabilities.p  pMy question is.. is it seen as an acceptable approach to run 3 DB queries within a web service If not what other approaches would be recommendedp  pI do appreciate the more DBs I query, potentially reliability could decrease but we have load balanced and clustered DB farms so generally the web service should always be able to connect to the DB serversp  pThoughts on approachesp

Negative 681 pI usually use c and am new to R. I dont quite know how to deal with this data type that Im getting when I return something from xpath. p  pI believe it is a list. I want to convert it to a vector. I know if it were an ordinary list like this p  precodegt testlist  list1,2,3,4,5 gt testlist [[1]] [1] 1  [[2]] [1] 2  [[3]] [1] 3  [[4]] [1] 4  [[5]] [1] 5 codepre  pand I could do codeunlistcode and get back  p  precodegt testvec  unlisttestlist gt testvec [1] 1 2 3 4 5 gt  codepre  pmy problem however is that when I use the xpath, I get something like p  precodetest  [[1]] ABT   [[2]] ABBV   [[3]] ACE   [[4]] ACN   [[5]] ACT  codepre  pif I try to do codeunlistcode, I just get p  precodegt unlisttest [[1]] ABT   [[2]] ABBV   [[3]] ACE   [[4]] ACN   [[5]] ACT   [[6]] ADBE  codepre  pSo I guess this is a list, but its a list of chars with no indexes I cant write this to a file, or I get p  precodegt writeunlisttest, file  test.txt Error in catlist..., file, sep, fill, labels, append     argument 1 type list cannot be handled by cat codepre  peven though I can dop  precodegt writeunlisttestlist, file  testlist.txt codepre  pjust fine. I cant seem to find any instructions on how to convert this weird list Ive got. I dont even know how I could reproduce something. p  pTo show an individual case of what Im doing, Ill show you what I get from my path. p  precode gt libraryXML  gt wikiurl  httpen.wikipedia.orgwikiListofS26P500companies  gt urlcontent  htmlTreeParsewikiurl, useInternal  TRUE  gt myxpath  div[idcontent and classmwbody]div[idbodyContent]div[idmwcontenttext]tabletr[2]td[1]atext  gt returnval  xpathSApplyurlcontent, myxpath  gt returnval  [[1]]  ABT  codepre  ponce again, Im getting this weird list of a char with no indices. Shouldnt it look something like p  precode gt reutrnval  [[1]]  [1] ABT codepre  pSo either Im not doing xpath the proper way or I theres something I should know more about lists. I just cant find any examples of this particular case. Thanks in advance p

Negative 681 pI want to open a new modal window using the MVVM pattern in a Xamarin Forms app. I have researched opening a new window with the MVVM pattern, which has got me this far, but the thing about windows in Xamarin forms, is they need a reference to the current page view to open a new window new view from. This forces me to pass a reference to the current page view from my viewModel, to my window factory, to launch the new window from. This is a violation of MVVM.

Negative 681 pI would like an authoritative answer on a point that has been a question mark for me for a little while.  There seems to be a frequent use of the term JavaScript to mean or describe UnityScript.  p  pI have been told time and again that you can use actual JavaScript to develop games in Unity, however from what I understand UnityScript could, at best, be described as a superset of JavaScript, but there really are some items that perhaps arent completely compatible and you cant simply use JS as you normally would to develop Unity games as you would have to follow their conventions.p  pAm I wrong about this  Can you actually use pure JS and its conventions directly to make Unity games outside of following the parameters that UnityScript has setp

Negative 681 pI am seeing a discrepancy in how fixed position elements behave within a relatively positioned parent.  According to the docs I am finding online, FireFox and Chrome should fix the element to the viewport and not the parent.  However, I am finding that if I do not specify a leftright value on a fixed element, it behaves in a sort of mix between static AND fixed, in the sense that its fixed vertically to the viewport, but moves as if it were a static element within the parent element.  I cant find any officialrespected documentation surrounding these conditions.  They all basically state something like the followingp  blockquote   pstrongFixed Positioningstrong   Do not leave space for the element. Instead, position it at a specified position relative to the screens viewport and dont move it when scrolled. When printing, position it at that fixed position on every page.p blockquote  pa hrefhttpsdeveloper.mozilla.orgenUSdocsWebCSSposition relnofollowSourceap  pSafari on the other hand, seems to render it as it is described where its fixed purely to the viewport, no matter if I set a parent element to relative without any toprightbottomleft properties defined.  Try it out in Safari if you have a chance by clicking on the teal div which positions it 100 pixels from the left.  The yellow bar will stay fixed to the viewportp  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netbbL8Lh4r2 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netbbL8Lh4r2ap  pSo which browser is rendering this correctly  All my browsers have been updated to the latest.

Negative 681 pI have a Jenkins job that includes an Android app and a common library.  I use Jenkins Multiple SCM plugin to download both git repos and then build and run.p  pThe common library gets updated more frequently than the app, and sometimes these updates break compatibility with the App.  When the App gets updated and committed, its generally guaranteed to have fixed any incompatibilities against the latest library version.p  pThe jenkins job should trigger emonlyem for commits to the App.  Under the common lib SCM, I have added Dont trigger a build on commit notifications as well as Polling ignores commits from certain users excluding .p  pHowever, this job still gets run when commits happen to the lib, resulting in a lot of broken build notifications.  What am I doing wrongp  pThanks.p

Negative 681 pI have a bit of code doing some parts of an http request processor.   When certain web requests come in, eg PUT, with attached xml or json, I have to convert the payload string into various types or try to anyway to see which registered methods match the URLprovided type pair.p  pIm using VS 2010 and for the xml, it was straight forward as the deserialization method took in Type as a parameter.   I have the Type I am attempting to match to in realtime.   However, for JSON conversion, the method is templatizedgeneric maybe  I dont know c that well, Im a c guy normally.

Negative 681 pYou do a pass through the student array to count how many students there are in each school. You store the counts in a counts array.p  pYou allocate another array of Students with size equal to the input array. You will use this temp array to hold the sorted elements.p  pUsing the counts array you calculate the beginning index for each school in the sorted array by noticing that the starting index for a school is the cumulative number of students for all the schools before it in the array. E.g. if the counts are 5, 10, 12 for schools a, b, c then the starting indexes for each schools students in the sorted array are 0, 5, 15p  p You do another pass through the student array and whenever you encounter a student from a school you add that student to the right portion of the helper array and increment that portions index.p  pThe helper array is now sorted by school and by ID within each school.

I want to sort a linked list using quicksort which is fairly simple, but I have been struggling with a strange issue while swapping nodes in the list. For reference, the getNode function returns a node at a certain index in the list and the nodes hold a pointer to a guitar object along with the a next node pointer. I have been experimenting for hours now and I figured out that the line such as this, list.getNodeh.element  temp.element is saying that the pointer to a guitar object in a node in the list is being assigned the value of the pointer in the temp object. This would normally work but I get an error at this point saying that the left side is not a modifiable lvalue. However I could make a pointer and put it on the left side of the assignment operator without any errors. Also, the left hand side has no error when I use the dereferencing operator  in front, but this does not successfully swap the nodes. I must be missing something.p

Negative 681 pI have a business web page I am working on that is part of a large suite of pages we have. This particular page is for managing assets. I make use of a Dynamic Class DynamicUIHelper that was written by a developer that is no longer with the company. However, the class works on the pages he wrote.p  pHere is my predicament. I am able to successfully build the 34 dynamic controls on the web page. The record associated with these 34 controls populates into the controls successfully. I have a Dictionary as a global variable on the page that contains a key for each control that I placed dynamically. If I make a change to one of the values, I can press a [SAVE]  that will take that Dictionary and save the changes to the database. The process itself works, because other pages that we use it onit works. The problem I am having, is that when I press the [SAVE] button, the postback causes me to lose the Dictionary variable. In other words, the 34 items contained within are now gone.p  pSo right now, I have a TreeView Telerik RadTreeViewthat contains the Asset List. When you get a NodeClickEvent, it saves the NodeID into a Session variable and then calls a Response.Redirect. Upon PageLoadComplete, if the Session variable  null, then it calls all of the Dynamic building stuff. This process works as expected.p  pSo instead of using the Response.Redirect, I have tried to just cause a postback to the page that will handle the dynamic fieldshowever, the DataList although it shows it has accepted 34 controls into it, will not display them on the page after a postback. It only shows them on the page if I do the Response.Redirect.p  pSo after that, I tried to store my Dictionary variable into a Session variable so that it would persist across the Page redirect. This is where I am now. I feel this is the best solution, however I cannot get it to work as I need it to.p  pThe variable is stored in Session. The page redirectsand then as a test, I have a breakpoint in PagePreRenderit retrieves the Dictionary from the Session successfullywith 34 items. Then the page throws an error in  server application. Response is not available in this context. And the page never gets loaded.p  pSo after searching around a little, I changed my code to Response.RedirectURL, false Now, I get everything back as expected, and the page DOES load however, the dynamic controls are not being placed on the screen.p  pNOTE I use a Site.Master. Due to character constraints I am unable to post everything you may want to see. I may or may not be able to post business sensitive classescode as well.p  pSo Im in a pickle because I can get each piece to work separately, but I cant get them all to function together. Any help or insight would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.p  pstrongAsset ASPXstrongp  precode                  lt  THIS IS WHERE THE FIXED ASSETS TREE VIEW GOES  gt                      lttelerikRadAjaxLoadingPanel IDajaxLoadingPanel runatservergt                     lttelerikRadAjaxLoadingPanelgt                     lttelerikRadAjaxPanel IDajaxPanel runatserver LoadingPanelIDajaxLoadingPanelgt                          lttelerikRadTreeView IDtvAssets runatserver Width300px ExpandNodeOnSingleClicktrue EnableFilteringtrue OnContextMenuItemClicktvAssetsContextMenuItemClick                             OnClientEntryAddedOnClientEntryAdded FilterSettingsHighlightMatches OnNodeClicktvAssetsNodeClick                             OnClientContextMenuItemClickingonClientContextMenuItemClicking OnClientContextMenuShowingonClientContextMenuShowing                             EnableDragAndDropBetweenNodestrue OnNodeDroptvAssetsNodeDrop EnableDragAndDroptrue                             OnClientNodeDroppingonNodeDropping OnClientNodeDraggingonNodeDragginggt                             ltContextMenusgt                                 lttelerikRadTreeViewContextMenu IDMainContextMenu runatservergt                                     ltItemsgt                                         lttelerikRadMenuItem ValueClone TextClone ...

Negative 681 pIve installed Bootstrap 3 via NuGet on an ASP.NET MVC 5 Project. Its working fine but when I deploy the application on a testserver no glyphicons are displayed. The problem is that I deploy in a virtual subfolder, for example dev.fritz.boxmyapp. In the bootstrap css file relative paths were usedp  precodefontface    fontfamily Glyphicons Halflings   src url..fontsglyphiconshalflingsregular.eot   src url..fontsglyphiconshalflingsregular.eotiefix formatembeddedopentype, url..fontsglyphiconshalflingsregular.woff2 formatwoff2, url..fontsglyphiconshalflingsregular.woff formatwoff, url..fontsglyphiconshalflingsregular.ttf formattruetype, url..fontsglyphiconshalflingsregular.svgglyphiconshalflingsregular formatsvg  codepre  pSo the app try to load the font from dev.fritz.boxfontsglyphiconshalflingsregular.eot instead of dev.fritz.boxmyappfontsglyphiconshalflingsregular.eot  This result in a 404 error and is a real problem for me because on the production server the application should also run in a subfolder. p  pIm searching for a solution that doesnt require me to do corechanges on the bootstrap.css file so that I can update them without modification. The only way I found out is to create a stylesheet which overrides the wrong path generated by bootstrap like thisp  precodefontface    fontfamily Glyphicons Halflings   src urlfontsglyphiconshalflingsregular.eot   src urlfontsglyphiconshalflingsregular.eotiefix formatembeddedopentype,        urlfontsglyphiconshalflingsregular.woff2 formatwoff2,        urlfontsglyphiconshalflingsregular.woff formatwoff,        urlfontsglyphiconshalflingsregular.ttf formattruetype,        urlfontsglyphiconshalflingsregular.svgglyphiconshalflingsregular formatsvg  codepre  pThis works because of ASP.NETs bundles. The bundled css is avaliable from the root of the application in my case dev.fritz.boxmyappmybundle.css so that all paths are relative to this file, which is the root of the application as well. But Im not pleased with this, I see it more as a workaround than a solution. The reason is that the browser try to load the fonts from the wrong path before hes using my cssfile with the fix. So there is a unecessary request made, which waste ressources, increases page loadtime and create an error in the browserconsole. p  pThe other reason is that this issue may be occur in other librarys as well which I need for the project. So I want to fix the main issue. Is there a way how I can force ASP.NET to use absolute paths in CSS files p  pThe files get modified anyway for bundeling. So it should be possible to replace the paths here too. Because this will only happening once on compingpublishing, there would be any fear for a worse performance because of this. p

Negative 681 pOk I am beginning to get involved with TypeScript and I have a general question I could use some assistance on.  I want to use TypeScript with Angular JS and I want to control these items with gulp build tasks.  My ultimate goal would be to get all my transpiled TypeScript concatenated in a file with the angular lib so one JS file to serve to users.  However, I want the sourcemaps to work correctly and link back to the .ts files not the transpiled javascript.  I got it working but the sourcemaps linked back to the transpiled JS not the typescript.  Is there a way to do this  I only see folks referencing angular in a separate script tag on the web.  In addition, how do the typing files factor into this  While of lesser importance to me I would think the .d.ts files for angular should be part of my gulp build process in order to debug angular JS from TS files Again I dont necessarily care too much about this as I dont anticipate debugguing angular code but who knows.  If it helps any I have experimented with the following npm gulp plugins gulpconcat, gulptypescript, gulpsourcemaps.p  pI have tried something like the followingp  precodevar config       bowerDir dirname  bowercomponents,     applicationDir dirname  app,     stylesDir dirname  styles,     publicDir dirname  public   gulp.taskcompilejs, function      var bundler  browserify             basedir config.applicationDir,             debug true                  .addconfig.applicationDir  index.ts         .plugintsify         .transformdebowerify      return bundler.bundle         .pipeexorcistconfig.publicDir  application.js.map         .pipesourceapplication.js         .pipegulp.destconfig.publicDir  codepre  pI found this here a hrefhttpwww.davidkudera.com20150228typescriptgulpbowerbrowserify relnofollowhttpwww.davidkudera.com20150228typescriptgulpbowerbrowserifyap  pJust one problem with the above, when I try to require the Angular module in index.ts the gulp task errors out saying it cannot find that module.

Negative 681 pFolks,p  pI am trying to track why my application stops responding to events.p  pSome Background The App in question MyCApplication is a C application with both C and C code it also referenced a .Net dll which exposes functionality as COM objects, these are register using regasm and the associated tlh is used to resolve these classes to load and use. The app also uses a third party Messaging library IPWorks, we use the SSL version for c here and this talks to other systems which are .net based over IP. These other systems use the .Net version of IpWorks,  MyCApplication acts as the business logic engine and the other apps handle Data, GUI etc.p  pThis all seems to work fine in testing amp in many client sites, in some client sites we are getting reports where the GUI is not responding to an clicks now we have seen this occur on site, the GUI is hanndling the Key Presses and dispatches its messages approiately It seems MyCApplication is not handling receiving the events.p  pWe caught this issue and using procdump mp we got a dump to analyze.p  pI automate this for Crashes with our own application which calls out to the console version of windbg, we execute the following commands for a crash p  panalyze v .ecxrp  pNow i understand this will be of no use for a hang, so i execute additional commands after this has setup the symbol paths for me etc.p  precode    Opened log file CcrashAutomateCrashAnalysisAutomateCrashAnalysisbinDebugCrashSummary1584124051.txt      Microsoft R Windows Debugger Version 6.12.0002.633 X86     Copyright c Microsoft Corporation.

Negative 681 pJust want to check if the Apache Calcite can be used for the use case Data Federation. The idea is I have a master query 5 tables that has  tables from one database say Hive and 3 tables from another database say MySQL. Can I execute master query on multiple database from one JDBC Client interface  If this is possible where the query execution particularly inter database join happens Also, can I get a physical plan from Calcite where I can execute explicitly in another execution engine  p  pI read from calcite documentation that it can push down Join and GroupBy but I could not understand it Can anyone help me understand this p
Negative 681 pI have a problem with the datagridview in c forms. I have a combo box column in dgv1, when i select a value, the value isnt really selected until i press a button or a text field or anything else. The odd thing that when i press on the tool strip menu, the box in the dgv1 is not losing focus, so for example i select a value in the combo box , and then i press FileSave i get an error.p  pI read other questions similar to mine and I saw that the problem might be with validation. I tried to add  codethis.Validatecode in the cell end edit function for the dgv, but that didnt work.  I also tried to add that in the tool strip menu click event, validating the dgv, refreshing it and many other function, but nothing seems to work.p
Negative 681 pIm making an application that copies files from one location to another, in my application I use thread pool so a few copies could be done together. When I tried to copy a read only file I got access denied exception. In order to fix that I changed the file attributes to RW by using this commandp  precodeFile.SetAttributesfileName, File.getAttributesfileName amp FileAttributes.ReadOnly codepre  pThe file attributes was changed successfully but the copy commandp  precodeFile.CopyfileName, destinationPath, true codepre  preturned the same access denied exception.p  pWhen I run this applucation again on the same file, everything is run properly and the copy success because the file attributes was changed in the last running. My question is why the file wasnt copied in the first application running even I changed the attributes first and just then I tried to copy the filep
Negative 681 pI read the other posts on this issue but the solutions were not the solutions to my problem. I followed 5 simple steps that seemed to work fine but Im still being asked for my password. It seems like the CentOS server is not even trying to use rsa keys.p  pOn the Windows10 client Cygwin I ranp  precodesshkeygen t dsa chmod 600 .sshiddsa scp .sshiddsa.pub userremote.com codepre  pOn the CentOS serverp  precodecat iddsa.pub gtgt .sshauthorizedkeys chmod 700 .ssh   codepre  pFinally, the last step should be to try to ssh into the server again and it shouldnt ask for the password. It does still ask for a password. I restarted the CentOS server and tried again but the problem persists. I closed and reopened cygwin and the problem persists. I can see that my key was added to authorizedkeys. The chmod commands worked. The sshkeygen command worked. What am I missingp

Negative 681 pIm new to jms and I was wondering when I get to know that jms Connection is a thread safe objectin contrast from JDBC. According to this the technique when we create different sessionsmessage producers from one jms connection and later use them in different threads is acceptable. For example in need to send 10k messages to destinations. In this case I can create one connection 10 sessions and 10 message producers and use sessionmessage producer in dedicated thread. But I cant understand how such approach could be efficient. As I understand jms Connection is dedicated to single TCP connectionsocket and all sessionsproducers will use the same TCP connection. p  ul liif all threads will write to socket in parallel we end up with unpredictable byte stream to broker.  That is not acceptable.li liif threads would write successively they need to synchronize access to connection and it would be a bottleneck.li ul  pPlease explain why jms spec permit such approach.p

Here is my codep  precode This module will check the handshake files sent by Pivot based on the following conventions  First handshake file loaded to the CFL, auditv2 Check every halfhour  Second handshake file proofs are loaded and available, handshake Check every 2 hours  import smtplib from email.mime.text import MIMEText from datetime import datetime, timedelta from csv import DictReader from subprocess import  from os import chdir from glob import glob   def main     auditin  prodbcslgnpclientappcsvbillauditprocesslgnp.smr.csv0000.audit.qty     with openauditin, rbU as auditqty             myauditreader  DictReaderauditqty, delimiter, restkeyignored         myauditreader.fieldnames  Property Code,                                       Pivot ID,                                        Inwork File,                                        Billing Manager Email,                                        Total Records,                                        Number of EBills,                                        Printed Records,                                        File Date,                                        Hour,                                        Minute,                                        Status           Get current time to reconcile against         now  datetime.now           Change internal directory to location of handshakes         chdirprodbcslgnpinput             for line in myauditreader             pivid  line[Pivot ID]             status  line[Status]             filedate  datetimeintline[File Date][4],                                  intline[File Date][46],                                  intline[File Date][68],                                  intline[Hour],                                  intline[Minute]              printfiledate             if status  s                 diff  now  filedate                 print diff                 print pivid                 if 10 lt diff.seconds  60 lt 30                     proc  Popenls lh 0.formatstatus,                                  shellTrue  figure out how to get output                      print proc     def sendemailrecipientlist     msg  MIMETextInsert message here     msg[Subject]  Alert Handshake files missing     msg[From]  rxxxxxx.com     msg[To]  recipientlist      s  smtplib.SMTPrxxx.xxx.xxx     s.sendmailmsg[From], msg[To], msg.asstring     s.quit   if name  main     main codepre

Negative 681 pIm building a small sync utility in C, for personal use mostly.p  pImagine we have two directories A and B that will be synced. At some point, the new files from A will have to be copied to B. The logic I used so far wasp  precodebrowse directory A for each Aafile     copy Aafile to Bafile endfor for each Aadirectory     recurse into Aadirectory endfor codepre  pThis worked well, until I noticed that with the method above, ALL of the files from A are copied EVERY TIME to B. So, I would only like to perform the copy operation if Aafile and Bafile are different.p  pSo, my question is, how can I compare them in a fast and crossplatform hopefully manner Will something like computing MD5 checksums for each file be fastp  pThe point is, since the file comparison will be probably done for a large number of file pairs, I want something that is both reliable and fast. And by fast I mean that the heavy and timeconsuming task should be the actual copy operation and not the file checking.p  pPS. I also tried finding tricks, like comparing file size and modification times, with no success.p  hr  h2EDITh2  pAfter taking into consideration the answers below, what I will finally go with to check if the two files are the same isp  precodeif optimizespeed then       if Aafile is newer then no cause Aafile is the source file       if Bafile is newer then compare bytetobyte and decide  else       compare bytetobyte and decide end codepre

Negative 681 pI send some data from main.php to process.php using jquery POST.

If it get 11 rows or even if each row data is larger, the row limit can be upto 9 rows, no output is given by the cbdata. Then I put an alert box codealertData Receivedcode to check whether the callbackdatacbdata is returing or not. I can see, it is not even returning data, it has been fixed to the message codeltbgtLoading...... Please Waitltbgtcode which I set before sending POST request. p  pAt first I thought that there may be error in my process.php page or in database. But I found that If I reduce the number of fetched row [for the sent back table] from database by giving some mysqli condition, the codecbdatacode is showing. Even If I execute the process.php independently without the POST by main.php, the larger table is shown.p  pSo, I cannot find what is making the unavailability of codecbdatacode if the table size is slightly larger I think, a table of 910 rows is not a big size table, why the data cannot be processed. I can make you sure that there is no error in code of process.php page, as the same table is showing if executes independently [by executing process.php page alone].p  pAny ideap
