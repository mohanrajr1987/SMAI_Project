So I thought, well, if I did something like this as a method in Javap  precodepublic int test     return 0  codepre  pWould the integer return show that there isisnt an error returnedp

Negative 4705 pIm running a SharePoint Application on a MOSS 2007 with a form based user authentication without using the MySite feature.

Negative 4705 pI am using a macro to export a table in a Microsoft Access database to a csv file in order to import into a mysql database. I ended up using a batchfile that would place a marker in the text file before the exporting took place, and then place everything after the last marker into a new file.

So, the setting for the outgoing mail server are correct, as were receiving other emails just fine.p  pIm using a SendEmail activity right after the createApprovalTask activity to send an email back to the submitter telling them weve received their approval request.

Negative 4705 pI have a form that acts as MDI parent form and several other forms as MDI child. The child windows have FormBorderStyle.None and ControlBox  false so that no border stuff from the MDI children is displayed in the MDI parent.

Negative 4705 pI am rewriting the core NIO server networking code for my project, and Im trying to figure out when I should store connection information for future use.  For example, once a client connects in the usual manner, I store and associate the SocketChannel object for that connected client so that I can write data to that client at any time.  Generally I use the clients IP address including port as the key in a HashMap that maps to the SocketChannel object.  That way, I can easily do a lookup on their IP address and asynchronously send data to them via that SocketChannel.p  pThis might not be the best approach, but it works, and the project is too large to change its fundamental networking code, though I would consider suggestions.  My main question, however, is thisp  pAt what point should I store the SocketChannel for future use  I have been storing a reference to the SocketChannel once the connection is accepted via OPACCEPT.  I feel that this is an efficient approach, because I can assume that the map entry already exists when the OPREAD event comes in.  Otherwise, I would need to do a computationally expensive check on the HashMap every time OPREAD occurs, and it is obvious that MANY more of those will occur for a client than OPACCEPT.  My fear, I guess, is that there may be some connections that become accepted OPACCEPT but never send any data OPREAD.  Perhaps this is possible due to a firewall issue or a malfunctioning client or network adaptor.  I think this could lead to zombie connections that are not active but also never receive a close message.p  pPart of my reason for rewriting my network code is that on rare occasions, I get a client connection that has gotten into a strange state.  Im thinking the way Ive handled OPACCEPT versus OPREAD, including the information I use to assume a connection is valid and can be stored, could be wrong.p  pIm sorry my question isnt more specific, Im just looking for the best, most efficient way to determine if a SocketChannel is truly valid so I can store a reference to it.  Thanks very much for any helpp

As I review methods for securing sensitive data in publicly accessible databases I have frequently come across the notion of database translucency. There is a hrefhttpwww.wayner.orgbookstdthe original booka on the subject and an a hrefhttpwww.oreillynet.compubanetwork20020802simson.htmlexcellent tutorial on the subject from Oriellyneta.p  pMy concern is that I have seen very little information regarding this idea on what I would consider verymodern programming sites like this one. There does not seem to be an article about the idea on wikipedia. No questions on the subject here, and no very recent tutorials or articles on the subject. To be uberbrief, the idea is that certain data is clear to some users of the system, while other users a cryptographically prevented from accessing that data, even if they have administrator access.p  pI have done substantial work on a prototype database that provides translucent data access. I have run across a considerable problem To be truly translucent, there can be no mechanism for password recovery. If an administrator can reset a users password, then they can briefly gain access to a users data. To be truly translucent, the user must never loose the password. p  pThose of us who use strong encryption to protect private data in our daily lives technorati to be sure are used to this problem when using these kinds of strong encryption systems. If the word blowfish is part of your daily lexicon that is one thing, but a website that is consumer focused I am concerned that users will not be willing to wrap their mind around the truly encrypted just for you notion implicit with true database translucency. I am afraid of the support call that begins with I lost my password and ends with me saying There is nothing that I can do for you.p  pMy question Should I implement this method in my application Are there other open source applications that have gone down this route that I can compare database designs with esp using phpMySQL I anyone else pursuing these kind of truly secure, but really inconvenient feature sets Is there another database security model that is more popular and modern that I have missed Was database translucency a fad or a legitimate database design method that I should embrace While I always appreciate discussion I would prefer objective answers that I can leverage in my design.p

However there are certain aspects I need to take into consideration prior to proceeding any further.p  pMy application is such that it would upload documents to google documents and store contacts in google contacts.

Negative 4705 pIm making a project where I want the user to search for shops in different cities and would like the url to be like this domainshopcityname.p  pSo I created a controller in codeigniter called Shop. But I cant create a city function since the city part of the url changes dependent on city name. One easy way to do it would be to add a function called search and add the functionality there but then I get urls like domainshopsearchcityname which I really would like to avoid. p  pSo my question is if its ok to add my functionality directly into the constructor to avoid that extra search part in the url Im afraid that there might be some performance tricks involved that potentially keeps the class in memory so the constructor will not be called every time.p

Negative 4705 pI have a C program and a Python program on the same machine.  The C program generates some data in nested structures. What form of IPC is the best way to get this data across to the python program p  pSerializing in C especially nested structures is a real bear, from what I hear, due to lack of serialization libraries.  I am not very familiar with shared memory, but I assume the formatting of the C structures may not be very palatable to the python program when it comes to memory alignment and following pointers.  The ctype and struct library seems to be for nonnested structures only.  So far, what I am thinking is p  pWrap all the data in the C program into some xml or json format, write it via socket to python program and then let python program interpret the xmljson formatted data.  Looks very cumbersome with lots of overheads. p  pAny better ideas  p

Negative 4705 pIve inherited a project consisting of three levels of code. The lowest layer is native C that interacts with hardware. This is mature, stable and welltested. The intermediate level code is CCLI, which interacts with toplevel C code that contains the UI elements and some additional functionality. This C code is incomplete and was rushed in development it crashes frequently and is not fit for purpose. My task is debug it and complete it.p  pIm using VS 2008 to step through the multithreaded code to understand where to start with this project. Simple question in the Threads window, I have two named threads a Worker thread which communicates with some of the underlying hardware i.e. the C code and a User Interface thread. p  pStepping through the code, however, there are quite a few Worker Threads that have no name and no call stack associated with them, which appear seemingly randomly. They dont have an entry in the Debug Location toolbar, and they dont appear to be visible in the code when Show threads in source is selected.p  pWhat are they, and should I be concerned about them They dont appear to be from the native code as it uses Boost for threading and this is clear from the call stack. Freezing them or changing their priority seems to have no effect.p  pIve not debugged multithreaded code of this complexity before so any advice much appreciatedp

Negative 4705 pwe have a C application that hosts a flex application in a MFC dialog. Everything works fine, all button pushes etc are passed directly on to flex with no problem at all, except the enter and escape keys, which immediately closes the dialog.p  pWe can trap the enter key, by implementing codePreTranslateMessagecode or codeOnOKcode and impede the window closing behavior, but we still have the problem of passing these enter key pushes on to the hosted flex app further.p  pThere is no default button on the form or anything like that, perhaps MFC is linking the enter key to the close button in the title bar behind the scenes or something.p  pDoes anyone have any ideas how we can stop MFC from treating the enter key from being a special case.p  pThanks a lot for any hints.p  pEdit Here is codePreTranslateMessagecode that mmonem requested.p  precodeBOOL CFlexDialogPreTranslateMessageMSG pMsg    if pMsggtmessage  WMKEYDOWN        if pMsggtwParam  VKRETURN            mctrlFlexgtOnReturnKeyPressed       return TRUE           return superPreTranslateMessagepMsg  codepre  pBut it is not a suitable solution, calling a method in the flex app like that, as it makes life too difficult for the flex developer, it means he must write a special version implementing the return key behavior for every control.p  pWe just want MFC to treat the return and escape keys like every other key.p

Negative 4705 pFriends, p  pIm currently brushing up on my SQL Tuning knowledge and it appears that the VSQLSTATS view could be a useful tool to use. p  pMy question is, the references to this view both in the documentation and an Oracle SQL Book Im currently reading, mention that this view is faster. p  pWhat is meant by faster Is it updated more frequently than vsqlvsqlarea or is it just quicker to query this one table rather that perform a join on vsql and vsqlareap  pHere is the description from the a hrefhttpdownload.oracle.comdocscdE1188201server.112e17110dynviews3069.htmREFRN30396 relnofollowdocumentationa.p  blockquote   pVSQLSTATS displays basic performance   statistics for SQL cursors and   contains one row per SQL statement   that is, one row per unique value of   SQLID.

Negative 4705 pAfter carrying out some research I have found out that an RTSP media server for develivering video and audio can be implemeneted in java using Netty. After consulting the web site and veiwing the documentation I have still not found any real help on how an RTSP media server can be implemeneted using it. I have been stucktrying to solve this problem for a while now and I am well aware of the RTSP protocol, other streaming protocols and all the issues that come with streaming media. Could someone please piont me at a place to start so that I can slowly work my way through the implemenattion of an RTSP server in java Netty. Any online documentation or source code that is reasonably close to this issue, or shows the very basics would be a great help. Thank you.  p

Negative 4705 pI have an Access 2010 database with a VBA module that does some statistical analysis on the data.  The results of the statistical analysis cannot be generated by SQL, but they can be presented in tabular format.  Right now, I can run the VBA function in the Immediate window and it will loop over the results and write them to the terminal using Debug.Print.p  pId like to have the results of this function available to the rest of Access so that I can create queries and reports from the table of results.  So what Im looking for is how to turn my function into a dynamic table  a table that doesnt actually store data, but stores the VBA function that runs and fills in the table data dynamically whenever that table is used.p  pIve spent quite a bit of time looking at creating tables dynamically via MAKE TABLE queries or using DDL in VBA, but all of these examples use SQL to create the new table from existing records.  I cant use SQL to generate the results, so Im not really sure how to coerce the results into an object that Access will recognize.  Part of the problem is that Im just not familiar enough with Access VBA terminology to know what I should be looking for.p  pThanks for the help.p

Negative 4705 pi am bit confused about need and usage of yield method . First of all my question is that if we have two thread of different priority in runnablestate does jvm give the equal opportunity to both threads to execute in a round robin fashion .OR high priority thread will be given priorityEdit Assume OS is windows XP.p  pNow lets come to yield method of thread class. Yield method Causes the currently executing thread object to temporarily pause and allow other threadsof higher priority or same priority to execute. p  pAt one of the article given at a hrefhttporeilly.comcatalogexpjavaexcerptindex.html relnofollowhttporeilly.comcatalogexpjavaexcerptindex.htmla it is given at If, at any time, a thread of a higher priority than the current thread becomes runnable, it preempts the lower priority thread and begins executing which is what yield is also doing p  pSo looks like from the above statements yield is automatically taken care by jvm.Not sure what yield method is providing extra herep

Negative 4705 pI have been working with AJAX for a while now, but in limited and simple ways. I use JQueryp  pCurrently I am debugging a web application. The client side code uses JavaScript and JQuery. I noticed that in this application it is possible to have multiple AJAX requests sent out at the same time one right after the other. My concern is that because AJAX is asynchronous that the AJAX request might not be completed in the correct order. I was wondering if the proper AJAX callbacks will be executed regardless of witch response is returns first or the call back functions are executed in FIFO manner    p  pLet me elaboratep  pI have 2 AJAX requests A and B. Both A and B have there own call back functions. The app first makes request A then immediately afterward makes request B. Now the App expects A to return first. Now my question is what if B returns first. Which Call back will be executed  p  pI did some research and could not find any info on this issue. So I assumed that the browser would coordinate the callbacks. To make sure I wrote a little test. My test showed that regardless of which response returns first the first requests call back is always used first. p  pMy question is what is the behavior Also what techniques or methods are used to avoid such a case. p

Negative 4705 pI am parsing the USDAs food database and storing it in SQLite for query purposes.  Each food has associated with it the quantities of the same 162 nutrients.  It appears that the list of nutrients name and units has not changed in quite a while, and since this is a hobby project I dont expect to follow any sudden changes anyway.  But each food does have a unique quantity associated with each nutrient.p  pSo, how does one go about storing this kind of information sanely.  My priorities are multiprogramming language friendly Python and C having preference, sanity for me as coder, and ease of retrieving nutrient sets to sum or plot over time.p  pThe two things that I had thought of so far were 162 columns which Im not particularly fond of, but it does make the queries simpler, or a food table that has a link to a nutrientlist table that then links to a static table with the nutrient name and units.  The second seems more flexible i ncase my expectations are wrong, but I wouldnt even know where to begin on writing the queries for sums and time series.p  pThanksp

It currently looks like thisp  precodepragma once  if definedELITEBUILD     define BUILD 3  1 personal, 2 select, 3 elite elif definedSELECTBUILD     define BUILD 2 elif definedPERSONALBUILD     define BUILD 1 endif codepre  pIn one of my .rc files there is an include for codeversionconfig.hcode that looks like this somewhat redactedp  precodeif BUILD  1 define STRDESCRIPTION  Personal Edition elif BUILD  2 define STRDESCRIPTION  Select Edition elif BUILD  3 define STRDESCRIPTION  Elite Edition pragma messageSTRDESCRIPTION endif codepre  pI added the codepragmacode command as a logging effort.  After that include, the relevant parts of the .rc file looks like this again, a bit redacted for brevityp  precodeBEGIN     BLOCK StringFileInfo     BEGIN         BLOCK 040904b0         BEGIN             VALUE FileDescription, STRDESCRIPTION         END     END END codepre  pWhen I attempt to compile this project I get the error codeerror RC2104  undefined keyword or key name STRDESCRIPTIONcode.  Im at a bit of a loss.  The value exists, I can log it immediately after setting it, and there is no codeundefcode command for it.p  p EDITED p  pIf I add placeholder defines outside of the if block the project will compile, but the values arent showing up, so my problem appears to be related to conditional definitions.  Whats confusing me most at this point is that I can put a codepragma messagecode command inside the conditional block and its executed properly, but the values defined there are nonexistent.  Hoping someone can shed some light on this for me.p
Negative 4705 pI am just using the app engine python file conversion api for the first time. I am converting html to PDF. It seems to work well, and pretty fast too, but even though the html page is set to 960px width the resulting PDF crops off the content, because the PDF seems to be formatted to output portrait in A4 size.p  pLooking at the docs I cant see any options for this. If I could make it landscape it should fit.p  pAm I missing something obvious or is it always A4 portraitp

Negative 4705 pFTP is a pure TCPconnect protocol, and thus AFAIK as fast as it gets when considering TCP file transfer options.p  pHowever, there are some other products that do not run over TCP  examples are the commercial products a hrefhttpwww.fujitsu.comglobalservicessoftwarefiletransferBI.DANGUNa, a hrefhttpwww.asperasoft.comentechnologyfaspoverview1fasptechnologyoverview1faspa and a hrefhttpwww.filecatalyst.comfilecatalystisfastFileCatalysta.

Anyone know of a guide that deals specifically with thisp  precodeltStyle TargetTypexType localTimePickergt     ltSetter PropertyHeight ValueBinding RelativeSourceRelativeSource TemplatedParent, PathHeight gt     ltSetter PropertyWidth ValueBinding RelativeSourceRelativeSource TemplatedParent, PathWidth gt     ltSetter PropertyHorizontalAlignment ValueCenter gt     ltSetter PropertyVerticalAlignment ValueCenter gt     ltSetter PropertyTemplategt         ltSetter.Valuegt             ltControlTemplategt                 ltBorder BackgroundTemplateBinding Background                         BorderBrushBlack                         BorderThickness1gt                     ltStackPanel OrientationHorizontal                                 HorizontalAlignmentCenter                                 VerticalAlignmentTemplateBinding VerticalAlignmentgt                         ltToggleButton VerticalAlignmentTemplateBinding VerticalAlignment                                       Margin0                                       BackgroundTemplateBinding Background                                       BorderBrushTransparent                                       ContentBinding RelativeSourceRelativeSource TemplatedParent, PathHourgt                             ltToggleButton.Templategt                                 ltControlTemplate TargetTypexType ToggleButtongt                                     ltAeroButtonChrome SnapsToDevicePixelsTrue                                                        BackgroundTemplateBinding Background                                                        BorderBrushTemplateBinding BorderBrush                                                        RenderMouseOverFalse                                                        RenderPressedFalsegt                                         ltContentPresenter VerticalAlignmentTemplateBinding VerticalContentAlignment                                                           HorizontalAlignmentTemplateBinding HorizontalContentAlignment                                                           SnapsToDevicePixelsTemplateBinding SnapsToDevicePixels                                                           gt                                     ltAeroButtonChromegt                                 ltControlTemplategt                             ltToggleButton.Templategt                             ltToggleButton.Stylegt                                 ltStyle TargetTypeToggleButtongt                                     ltStyle.Triggersgt                                         ltTrigger PropertyIsMouseOver ValueTruegt                                             ltSetter PropertyOverridesDefaultStyle ValueTrue gt                                             ltSetter PropertyBackground ValueLightGray gt                                         ltTriggergt                                         ltTrigger PropertyIsChecked ValueTruegt                                             ltSetter PropertyForeground ValueRed gt                                             ltSetter PropertyFontWeight ValueBold gt                                                                                             ltSetter PropertyBitmapEffectgt                                                 ltSetter.Valuegt                                                     ltOuterGlowBitmapEffect GlowColorRed GlowSize30 gt                                                 ltSetter.Valuegt                                             ltSettergt                                         ltTriggergt                                     ltStyle.Triggersgt                                 ltStylegt                             ltToggleButton.Stylegt                         ltToggleButtongt                         ltLabel HorizontalContentAlignmentTemplateBinding HorizontalAlignment                                VerticalContentAlignmentTemplateBinding VerticalAlignment                                Contentgt                         ltToggleButton VerticalAlignmentTemplateBinding VerticalAlignment                                       Margin0                                       BackgroundTemplateBinding Background                                       BorderBrushTransparent                                       ContentBinding RelativeSourceRelativeSource TemplatedParent, PathMinute gt                      ltStackPanelgt                 ltBordergt             ltControlTemplategt         ltSetter.Valuegt     ltSettergt ltStylegt codepre

Negative 4705 pI have a codeMediaElementcode that plays video. I have my video stored, in binary, in my SQL Server database.p  pThe way this works out for me is that the Silverlight app reads ALL the binary data from a web service. The web service returns a codebyte[]code that I turn into a stream, and set as source for the codeMediaElementcode.p  pThe big problem with this is that it needs to read all the data before the codeMediaElementcodes source can be set. With large videos, this takes a long time.p  pSo, I was hoping to somehow take chunks, and buffer as I go, like any online video player does.p  pAny clues on how I can actually do thatp

Negative 4705 pIm writing a program to communicate with certain patient monitor using connectionless UDP sockets. I need a suggestion for the fastest and most efficient algorithm that I should use to parse the data received from patient monitor.p  pPatient monitor sends data as AttributeList structure, the definition of the structure is belowp  precodetypedef struct    uint16 count   uint16 length   AVAType  values  AttributeList  typdef struct    uint16 id   uint16 length   void  data  AVAType codepre  pSo an AttributeList contains many AVAType structures, and every AVAType structure contains id and data as void pointer data is just an placeholder for actual data in AVAType. In fact, there are about 150 ids defined for AVAType and each ID, data must be placed in some corresponding data structure for parsing purposes. p  pSo if ID in AVAType structure is 1, then data must be parsed using algorithm A but if ID is 2 then data must be parsed using Algorithm B and so on...p  pMy current approach is using 150 ifelse statements and loading the particular datastructure for AVAType and then parse the result. Also the patient monitor sends data in network byter order and I need unpack the AVAType as per the ID. p  pPlease suggest some good approach to deal with this situation. It is just an university thing, I do not brother much about safety, I think safety can be improved gradually but right now my concern in speed.p  pYes, it is actaully AVAType values[]. Can you be more specific on why is this different from AVAType   Can it be any useful if I define my structure other way aroundp

Negative 4705 pI have an application that polls a directory for newlyadded files and processes any new ones. Its a C .NET 4 app running on Windows 7, and the directory is in fact a network share.p  pThe problem is, while iterating thorugh the files to check that they exist, the app sometimes crashes without throwing an exception. I do use trycatch, and theres no unmanaged code, or delegate code, or anything abnormal. Its a simple appp  pThe iterating code looks like thisp  precodeSystem.IO.DirectoryInfo dp  new System.IO.DirectoryInfodestinationPath System.IO.FileSystemInfo[] destinationFiles  dp.GetFileSystemInfos  foreach FileSystemInfo fileSysInfo in destinationFiles    string filePath  fileSysInfo.FullName   if filePath.EndsWithFILEVALIDEXT ampamp Directory.ExistsfilePath ampamp File.ExistsfilePath  FILEPROCESSEDEXT         Do processing.

Negative 4705 pBrand new poster here on StackOverflow.  Ive been reading and learning here for some time, but I need to start asking a few questions and interacting, so any help with a few of my issues would be greatly appreciated.p  pI basically generate a list in a  tableView of default sounds from a plist in cellForRowAtIndexPath.  This generates me a list of say x sounds and one of those sounds has a default checkmark accessory placed on its cell.  I have a plist file that stores the active sound files index value, this is how I put the original checkmark in the generated tableView.  So, in the code below, as you can see, I load in the plists value for the active sounds index, however, when a user interacts with my tableView and they select a new sound, I need the default checkmark placed to be removed from view.  Everything else is working fine.  I cant seem to crack this simple problem, Im sure its a simple syntax issue, i just dont know how to get it done.  Im sure the solution is a single line of code or two and its right under my nose.  Thank you for help in advance. p  precode voidtableViewUITableView tableView didSelectRowAtIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath    NSDictionary dictionarySound  [NSDictionary dictionaryWithContentsOfFile[self ActDataFilePath]]  NSNumber defaultSoundIndex  [dictionarySound valueForKeysoundIndex]  int theIntVal  [defaultSoundIndex integerValue]   UITableViewCell cell  [tableView cellForRowAtIndexPathindexPath]  Everything below works just fine, checkmarks are removed and placed accordingly, sounds are played just fine.

Negative 4705 pI can do an fft of a voiceaudio signal and get the different phases, intensitys, and frequencies accurately.  What Im trying to understand is why do certain values for the phase angle become greater than 2pi or less than 2pi  I know I can do a modulo of the phase angle so it doesnt go past 2pi or 2pi but Im trying to understand why I can get a phase angle of 1343 radians or 234 radians and if there is another meaning to having such large phase angles.p  pAn Example would be quaternions which deals with higher dimensional math do we arbitrarily ignore something by not taking into account such large negative and positive phase angle values    p

Negative 4705 pAs I was reading up about couchdb I stumbled upon a question about transactions and couchdb. Apparently the way to handle transactions in couch is to pull the latest version and compare it to the version you are currently working with. This can present problems if data is changing quickly. The other way is a map reduce and to separate out the transactional data into multiple documents. This also seems less than optimal.p  pI was thinking about using redis for this sort of data. The increment and decrement functions seem fairly amazing for this sort of purpose.p  pSo I could just write some sort of string for a transactional key likep  precodesome user document     name guy,    id 10,    pageviews redis userpageviews10  codepre  pThen if I read something like redis inside of some piece of transactional data then I know to go get that information from redis. I suppose I could decide these things before hand, but since a document oriented databases primary mission is to be flexible and not bound data to columns I figured that there might be an easier wayp  pIs there an easy way to link redis data to couchdb should I be doing this all manually and for the few fields that come up Any other thoughts Would it be better to update this transactional data eventually in the user document or simply not store it there p

Negative 4705 pMy android app is taking more and more memory over time. I took a heap dump and analyzed it with MAT.p  pHeres the main leak suspect img srchttpi1157.photobucket.comalbumsp588alexisscreenshot.pngp  pSo it seems like one of my activities isnt cleared from memory after I quit the app with back button then when I restart the app a new instance is created and fills in the memory.p  pNow if theyre PhantomReferences why the memory isnt cleared after a while or when I quit the app The memory is never cleared even when I use other app etc. The only way to completely close the app is to use a task manager to manually kill the app.p  pWhat can I do to avoid this anarchic memory consumption p  pEDITp  pI found the problem Each activity was setting up a CustomExceptionHandler with Thread.setDefaultUncaughtExceptionHandler and that CustomExceptionHandler was keeping a reference to the context. So I got rid of the context reference and I nulled the DefaultUncaughtExceptionHandler in the onDestroy method. Thats really better nowp

There have been reports of intermittent errors when .wav files are saved, that after multiple times recording the device sometimes fails to record, and will not do so again until the device has been restarted.p  pIve replicated the error on a Dev kit, and through debugging have seen that when recording .wav files, the waveInOpen and waveInClose methods are being used from coredll.dll. However, when the problem occurs, waveInOpen is returning MMSYSERROR.ALLOCATED, indicating the resources are being used a false positive. There is never a time when waveInOpen is called without waveInClose being called after, to clear the resource.p  pDoes anyone know any problems with this dll, the hardware, or a way to force the resources to free so that recording can recommencep

Negative 4705 pI am working with MVVMLight in Windows Phone 7 for the first time. I THINK I have finally wrapped my brain around some of it. However, one area I am struggling with is where to create an instance of my database so that I only have one connection to it. I have two models in my project, each of which I want to have their own DataService. Is there someway to pass in a db connection to the constructor of the DataService Or would I do something like create a singleton of a DB connection object when the app starts Or am I completely on the wrong track and there is a much better way to do thisp

Negative 4705 pThe C language allows source files to be read in a single pass without looking ahead at any point the compiler only has to consider declarations, prototypes, macro definitions etc. that have appeared embeforeem its current position in the file.p  pDoes this mean that for a function call to be inlined, a compiler might require the function to be defined before the call For examplep  precodeint foovoid int barvoid  return foo  inline int foovoid  return 42  codepre  pIs the call to codefoocode more likely to be inlined if the inline definition is moved in front of the definition of codebarcodep  pShould I arrange inline definitions in my code so that they appear before the calls that should best be inlined Or can I just assume that any optimizing compiler that is advanced enough to do inlining at all will be able to find the definition even if it appears after the call which seems to be the case with gccp  pstrongEDITstrong I noticed that in the Pelles C with the codeOb1code option indeed requires the definition to visible before a call can be inlined. The Compiler also offers an codeOb2code option which removes this limitation and also allows the compiler to inline functions without an inline specifier, similar to what gcc does, but the documentation states that using this second option may require much more memory.p
Negative 4705 pIm creating some algorithms that are very performance heavy, e.g. evolutionary and artificial intelligence. What matters to me is that my update function gets called often precision, and I just cant get codesetIntervalcode to update faster than once per millisecond.p  pInitially I wanted to just use a while loop, but Im not sure that those kinds of blocking loops are a viable solution in the Node.js environment. Will Socket.ios socket.onid, cb work if I run into an infinite loop Does my code somehow need to return to Node.js to let it check for all the events, or is that done automaticallyp  pAnd last but not least, if while loops will indeed block my code, what is another solution to getting really low deltatimes between my update functions I think threads could help, but I doubt that theyre possible, my Socket.io server and other classes need to somehow communicate, and by other classes I mean the main codeWorldcode class, which has an update method that needs to get called and does the heavy lifting, and a codegetInfocode method that is used by my server. I feel like most of the time the program is just sitting there, waiting for the interval to fire, wasting time instead of doing calculations...p  pAlso, Id like to know if Node.js is even suited for these sorts of tasks.p

Negative 4705 pI am developing a php application to manage routine for subjects and teacher timing for my college.

Negative 4705 pDespite having started learning programming with Pascal and C, after the jump to OO C, Java I lost sense of the structured programming paradigm. I have started learning Lua and I have researched many tutorials, but all of them only cover basic operations and language features and capabilities. They feel more like a reference doc than a programmers guide.p  pNow, when trying to work with day to day tasks, how does one go through the most common design patterns like observer, multithreaded programming, UI elements and system calls for keyboard or sensors Is it even feasible in this languages or you have to work with the C binding, libraries and lowlevel programming to get most stuff done Do I get the Lua scope wrongp

A lot of concrete customer classes inherits from this class.p  pThe problem is that for some customers say CustomerB we do not use the objects Rule2 and Rule3 because the features in the application which are using these objects Rule2 and Rule3 are disabled from the application user interface for that customer, so we are not really needing to instantiate these objects at all.p  pThe simplified code is here, i.e in reality ApplicationRulesFactory has much more virtual methods, and more concrete customer classes that inherits from it p  precodeclass ApplicationRulesFactory    virtual Rule1  GetRule1  0   virtual Rule2  GetRule2  0   virtual Rule3  GetRule3  0      .....   class ACustomerRulesFactory  public ApplicationRulesFactory     Rule1 GetRule1          return new ACustomerRule1        Rule2  GetRule2        return new ACustomerRule2        Rule3 GetRule3      return new ACustomerRule3         class BCustomerRulesFactory  public ApplicationRulesFactory      Rule1 GetRule1            return new BCustomerRule1          Rule2 GetRule2  not needed             what to return here             Rule3 GetRule3  not needed            what to return here        codepre  pSo how should I go to implement this p  p1 Return some default implementation  in the base class ApplicationRulesFactory  p  precodeclass ApplicationRulesFactory    virtual Rule1  GetRule1  0   virtual Rule2  GetRule2   return new Rule2DefaultImpl   virtual Rule3  GetRule3   return new Rule3DefaultIml     codepre  pBut this seems wrong, to inherit new classesRule1DefaultImpl,Rule2DefaultImpl from Rule1, Rule2,  and probably make them with empty implementation just for the purpose of returnig them  like default implementation in the ApplicationRulesFactoryp  p2 or in the concrete class return the default implementaion and leave these methods pure virtual in the base class p  precodeclass BCustomerRulesFactory  public ApplicationRulesFactory    Rule1 GetRule1         return new BCustomerRule1       Rule2 GetRule2         return new Rule2DefaultImpl      Rule3 GetRule3        return new Rule3DefaultImpl    codepre  pThese solution also seems very ugly to redefine the methods in every concrete customer class although they are not needed.p  p3 Also I have a feeling that maybe I should not use inheritance like this, cause this violates the ISA rule for inheritance, cause a significant number of the methods are not applicable to all of the concrete customer classes, but don t how to go to implement this without inheritance.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 4705 pSay for example I have pseudo codep  pcodepublic IEnumerableltUsergt GetUsersstring namecode in my data access layer to Entity Framework, which at the moment does a code.ToListcode before returning, thus ensuring my business logic layer cannot interfere with my data access layer.p  pHowever I need a slightly different variation on this in my business logic layer, for example I need less data e.g. just userids or to further filter it. p  pTo have an efficient DB layer Id want another method returning a subset of the data overloaded method or whatever.p  pHowever, I could cheat and omit the ToList, and my business logic layer tacks on the end an AsQueryable. Thus my business logic layer is able to manipulate the underlying sql that is created.p  pWhat are peoples thoughts on AsQueryable in business logic layers It seems to me that this is a leaky abstraction over my data access layer, but it could be incredibly convenient, and perhaps because its in the LINQ namespace rather than EF namespace, that its not all that bad to usep  hr  pstrongEDITstrongp  pSomething useful to watch out for and argument against omitting ToList, is that if code calling it was previously relying on the ToList for databinding i.e. to avoid the error Data binding directly to a store query DbSet, DbQuery, DbSqlQuery is not supported. You wont get a compile time error, just a runtime error. So you need to make sure ToList is certainly called before the UI tier.p

Negative 4705 pstrongFirst of all Ill state that Im not asking for any code or complete solutions.strong Ill describe the problemp  blockquote   pYou are given number of rooms in a building and number of hallways between them. Every hallway connects 2 rooms and is given a weight. It is always possible to get to any room. You are supposed to reduce the complete weight of all hallways by removing them, printing out the weight reduced. p blockquote  pstrongAre these assumptions correctstrongp  ol lipThe building is a graph, rooms are vertices, hallways are edges connecting them. Therefore this is an undirected connected graph.pli lipYou can solve this by getting the weight of graphs minimal spanning tree, then doing complete weight minus the weight of MST  the result is sum of weights of hallways that can be removed.pli ol  pI have implemented Prims algorithm for the MST and the result is correct for the example case and for any other cases of MST that I found on the internet. However, the grading server still gives me wrong answer with no other information. I dont know whats wrong. There are no more than 100 vertices and 5000 edges in the input so the ranges should not be a problem. The weights are integers lt200. Im using adjacency matrix for the MTS. Example inputp  precode5 7   1 2 50   2 3 40   3 4 20   4 5 10   1 4 40   3 5 30 codepre  pIn this case the program prints 80. The complete weight is 190, minimal weight is 110, so we can remove 190  110  80p  pMy questions arep  ol liAre there any obvious mistakes that come to your mind Things to watch out for, why does it work for the example input etc..li liAre there any medium sized strongtest cases for MSTstrong on the internet that I could use to find the problemli listrongIs there any other way to solve this problemstrong I would happily try anything with the grading server.li ol  pIm completely new to graphs so I may be missing something.p

Negative 4705 pSo yes, normally you would increment an array using a for loop or a similar method, but in this scenario, thats not possible as I am already in a loop and need to only set one value in the array and move on. Heres the codep  precoden1 cat databasesIPS  grep v   while read LINE do   ENDPOINT[n]echo LINE  cut d f1   echo TESTING ENDPOINT[n]   let n done codepre  pSo the while loop will read several lines from a flat file database and pull the first colon separated value out which needs to be stored in the array. Things are just getting muddy from working on this project too long. I might have to just rethink this part.p  pSo the official question is, without using another loop, how can increment elements using a variable so I can setup the array in the current while loop.p  p UPDATE p  pI know what im trying to do seems a little weird and unorthodox. So the while loop reads a database line by line. During the first iteration of the while loop, the database gets read and the first cell on the first row of the database gets stored to in the array as array element 1 or could be 0, doesent matter. The while loops then goes back for its second pass, and pulls the first cell of the second row in database and it needs to store it to the array under element 2. The loop continues to do this until the end of the database.p  pSo I know how to read the contents of an array using a loop, but I have never set up an array using a loop. I cannot get the element number in the array to increment so that when the while loop does its next pass, it doesnt just keep overwriting array[1]p  pDoes that helpp  p UPDATE p  pSo it looks like this kinda works. The whole point of storing this database value in this array is because not only is it being used inside this while loop Omitted irrelevant code. but I need to use these values elsewhere in the script.p  pcat databasesIPS  grep v   while read LINE do   VARcodeecho LINE  cut d f1code   ENDPOINT[n]VAR   echo Heres the array variable ENDPOINT[n] donep  pProblem still is though that it doesnt appear to be truly storing to the array. Its just overwriting the first element in the array. If I try to echo any of the lower array values somewhere in the script, the only one that comes up is the the value in array element 0 and its set to the last entry in the database.p

Negative 4705 pI am using Backbone.js to build a hybrid web app, which will be served as a native app using Phonegap. One thing I need is offline support for a large amount of data, and so we are considering using native code to synchronise the offline data with the server, and just transfer the bits of data we need to the web app when necessary. An alternative approach we considered was using the Phonegap storage plugin but this is backed by WebSQL which seems to have a 5MB quota, which is too small for what we need.p  pAs the app is based on Backbone.js, which expects a RESTful API as its backend, we are toying with the idea of embedding a a hrefhttpsgithub.commattstevensRoutingHTTPServer relnofollowRoutingHTTPServera into the native layer  essentially this allows us to embed a local web server in the app, so that the web layer can request data using standard RESTful calls to the local server. The beauty here is that the Backbone app doesnt know any different  the workflow is entirely the same as requesting data from a remote server.p  pI was wondering if there is an equivalent of a hrefhttpsgithub.commattstevensRoutingHTTPServer relnofollowRoutingHTTPServera for Android I have seen projects like a hrefhttpcode.google.compijetty relnofollowiJettya, but ideally I would like something which gives the RESTAPI bit out of the box too like RoutingHTTPServer does. Would something like a hrefhttpwww.sparkjava.com relnofollowSparka work on Androidp

Negative 4705 pSo my iPhone app successfully uploads photos to Amazon S3.  I used the same code as the S3Uploader example project with the latest ver 1.6.0 Amazon AWS SDK for iOS.  The problem is intermittently Ill get the SignatureDoesNotMatch error The request signature we calculated does not match the signature you provided. Check your key and signing method..  Theres no pattern to it.  Currently my app is working around this error by doing a certain amount of retries on the delegate call didFailWithError.p  pSo far with my tests, there are enough retries so the user will not notice the error, but it is quite frustrating to know that I am getting a signature key error when my signature is clearly correct since it works at times.  I am not sure if it is a url encoding error my signature key has a  sign in it, but since Im using the iOS SDK I dont see how the PUT urls are handled.p  pAlso, I verified that my bucket name is all lower case, and my filenames are just numbers and a few alphabet letters.  I also tried different regions and they all have the same result.  In short it can take anywhere from 0 retries to 5 retries for to get a successful PUT without the SignatureDoesNotMatch error.  Has anyone had a similar issue  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks for reading.p
Negative 4705 pMy JNI function returns ProcessedImage objects. The relevant class definitions in Javap  precodepublic class Thumbnail    public int size   public byte[] data   public class ProcessedImage    public Thumbnail[] thumbnails   public byte[] hash  codepre  pMy native function declaration looks like thisp  precodepublic class ImageProcessor     Called from different JVM threads.   public static native ProcessedImage processImagebyte[] image    Only called once.   public static native initialize   static      System.loadLibraryImageProcessor     initialize     codepre  pNow I want to write a native initialize function that does the followingp  ol liFills a global matrix in native land. This matrix is later read in my processImage native function, but is immutable after this initialization. li liCalls a GraphicsMagick init function.li ol  p2 is easy since it needs to be called once. I am not sure what to do about 1. I could initialize the array here but it might not be visible to other Java threads which call the processImage function. May I assume that since this is in a static block this will get executed before any other JVM threads are created This seems like a wrong assumption. What is the best way for me to make sure that this array is later visible to other JVM threads I dont want to use locking to accesswrite to this matrix. If this were pure CC I would do something like thisp  precodeattributeconstructor static void Initialize     Initialize everything here.  codepre  pAnother question is what is the best place to cache jclasses and jfieldIDs Should I look them up in the initialize function and store them as globals. I read that this is not a good practice since jclass and jfieldIDs might become obsolete after a class gets unloaded and loaded again. The standard practice seems like one should do this in a static block within the class. Something like thisp  precodepublic class Thumbnail    private static native initializeThumbnailNative   static      initializeThumbnailNative      public int size   public byte[] data  codepre  pSince a class could get loaded and unloaded on a thread different from the one my native function processImage is being called from, my native function might not see the change to these global jclasses and jfieldIDs. What is the recommended way to handle this. Again I could lock access to these fields and retry the native method on an exception, but that doesnt seem right. Another hacky way that could possibly work is I could create single instances of all the classes in java and store them as statics so that there is always at least a single instance of these classes and they are never unloaded. So something like this p  precodepublic class ImageProcessor    public static native ProcessedImage processImagebyte[] image   public static native initialize    Create a static instance to prevent these classes from being unloaded.   private static Thumbnail thumbnail  new Thumbnail   private static ProcessedImage processedImage  new ProcessedImage   static      System.loadLibraryImageProcessor     initialize     codepre  pI am not sure if this will work though. What would be the best way to achieve caching of jclasses and jFieldIDs in a multithreaded application I apologize in advance for the lengthy question but I wanted to provide maximum context.p

My approach in the onCreate to set the listeners wasp  precode1    for int i1 ilt32 i 2                3                   button[i]  ButtonfindViewByIdR.id.button[i] 4                   button[i].setOnTouchListenerthis 5                codepre  pI set the Button[] like that  codeButton[] buttonnew Button [64]codep  pNow, eclipse tells me in line 3 button cannot be resolved or is not a field and it just underlines the word button, so I think it ignoresjust does not recognize the [i] arraystuff.p  pThe rest of my code seems to get on with that perfectly because it gets recognized as an object correct me if I said that wrong but the findViewById doesnt get on with it ..p  pThanks for the replies, Alexp

Negative 4705 pI would like to hear your opinions about a subject that bothers me in the last few days..p  pIn our project we are using MassTransit servic bus. we create a singleton instance of IServiceBus interface of MassTransit using IoC container, and all the classes that need this IServiceBus get it in the constructor. This caused that a lot of classes in our project gets the IServiceBus as a constructor parameter, which makes them coupled with the MassTransit service bus, and actually to the concept of notification using a message queue.p  pI think that it is a bad example of coupling. p  pBy passing the IServiceBus to various classes, we are defining the way that this class should send notifications to out side listeners, and forcing the way to be a service bus oriented way.p  pI think that the classic way of .NET is better  the class should define an event in its interface with a .NET event handler, and any observer that would like to use this event handler should subscribe to it.p  pWhat we earn in that way is that we are not committed to an implementation of a class with a service bus. That way, the service bus can become an observer for that class event handler, and when that event occurs, it raises logic that sends some message to the service bus queue.p  pThis also raises a big question..p  pWhen and why should we use service bus in a project, given that the project runs on a single processp  pIf the projects consists of several processes I can see the advantages because it is easier to pass strong typed messages using a message queue, but I cant understand the benefits when it is in one process scope. If I want classes to inform notifications to observers, consumers etc, I would raise an event from within the class, and create a single or closed group of dispatcher classes that will subscribe to all these events in my project, that way I can handle the logic of the message transportation. Also,in that way the logic of adding an observer will be centered at one place in the project.p  pI will be glad to hear your thoughts on the subject..p  pGuy p

Negative 4705 pI have an Accessibility Service which listens to UI events from installed apps in an emulator.

For webview it doesnt work, and I do not get events for graphic controls inside the webview. With API level level 18, we can request for Enhanced Web Accessibility in an Accessibility Service for webviews and hybrid apps. I have enabled this flag in my Accessibility Service properly.

The only difference is that the 2 application look at different SQL servers for their data. The SQL server is specified in an .ini file that the Delphi reads on startup.p  pMy problem is that I would like to be able to switch from one application to the other from within the application itself application 1 switches to application 2.p  pI know I can rename the application before compiling but I need the source code the same.

Since I have shadowed, the base version should no longer be accessible to 3rd level classes. And since it is private, this version too should not be accessible. But Im able to access it the 1st level version in codeRectanglecode class. Why is that so Whats the workaroundp  pstrongEditstrongp  pRegarding Nicos answerp  pemRectangularDrawingObjects ToXMLInternal is still valid when accessing Rectangle from the outside.emp  pThis is not correct. ToXMLInternal isntshouldnt be availble when accessing codeRectanglecode from the outside because it is Protected at best.p  pemIf you call ToXMLInternal from inside Rectangle, it is different. Then the caller knows that there is a shadowing method and uses this instead of RectangularDrawingObjects method.emp  pRectangularDrawingObjects method emisem the shadowing method. What does this passage mean thenp  pAnd if I understand your point correctly, then there is no possible situation in which codePrivate Shadowscode would ever work or be required. Yes VS should then warn about it saying Private and Shadows cannot be combined, like it does for many other keywords e.g. codePrivatecode and codeOverridablecode.p

Negative 4705 pI intended to use Eclipse with MinGW. But after all the setup done, I got this strange error. Well its not an error actually. I think its a bug.

It works but like thisp  pSuppose I am running this code p  precodeincludeltstdio.hgt int main      int a, b, c     printfEnter two numbersn     scanfd d, ampa, ampb     c  ab     printfd, c     return 0  codepre  pAfter running the program, the console appears like this img srchttpi.stack.imgur.com774cE.png altenter image description herep  pWhen I run this program first, and it appears to be that the codeprintfcode statements are executing after all the codescanfcode statements are done. Now this problem quickly resolves if one just adds an codefflushstdoutcode after every codeprintfcode. But there should be some solutions in the terms of configuration and setup, adding an codefflushstdoutcode doesnt look very comfortable to me, imagine it in a menu driven program with 10 or more options. So is there anything else I can do about thisp  pI have already tried this.p  blockquote   p   codeProject gt Properties gt RunDebug Settings gtcode Select the .exe and click codeedit gtcode go to option codeEnvironmentcode and select codenewcode and give codeName  PATHcode and codeValue  CMinGWbincode p blockquote  pBut sadly it didnt work.p

Negative 4705 blockquote   pTimezonesp      pKeep in mind that Angular datetime filter uses the time zone settings of the browser.

Negative 4705 pI am researching whether or not it is possible to automate the scoring of students code based off of coding style. This includes things like avoiding duplicate code, commented out code, bad naming of variables and more. p  pWe are trying to learn based off of past semesters composition scores ranging from 13, which leads nicely to supervised learning. The basic idea is that we extract features from a students submissions, and make a featurevector, then run it through logistic regression using scikitlearn. We also have tried various things including running PCA on the feature vectors to reduce dimensionality. p  pOur classifier is simply guessing the most frequent class, which is a score of 2. I believe that its because our features are simply NOT predictive in any way. strongIs there any other possible reason for a supervised learning algorithm to only guess the dominant classstrong Is there any way to prevent thisp  pAs I believe its due to the features not being predictive, strongis there a way to determine what a good feature would bestrong And by good, I mean discriminable or predictive. p  pNote As a side experiment, we tested how consistent the past grades were by having readers grade assignments that had already been graded. Only 55 of them gave the same composition score 13 for the projects. This might mean this dataset is simply not classifiable because humans cant even grade consistently. strongAny tips on other ideasstrong Or whether or not that is in fact the case p  pemFeatures includeem Number of lines of duplicate code, average function length, number of 1 character variables, number of lines that include commented out code, maximum line length, count of unused imports, unused variables, unused parameters. A few more... We visualized all of our features and found that while the average is correlated with the score, the variation is really large not promising.p  pemEditem Scope of our project we are only trying to learn from one particular project with skeleton code given in one class. We dont need to generalize as of yet. p

Negative 4705 pIm working on a model that must perform a lot of linear regressions, it is a forecast model and its index is a date.  To minimize the running time, I tried with multiprocessing module in python.  The script runs fine and runs over all the cpus, but I cant save the data into the same dataframe, the script overwrites the dataframe and dont save all the calculations, each loop must fill a dataframes column.  I tried to use global variables, but it didnt work.  I appreciate too much your help.p  pWhen I run the script without multiprocessing it works fine and the data are saved succesfully.p  pThe error is global name dfpronostico is not defined.p  pThanks.p

Negative 4705 pMy models dont really matter in this case, this is a fundamental Python question, I suppose.p  pSay I have a queryset of items and I want to calculate some things for each one to be displayed in a template.p  pIn my view, I can create a list of objects, and for each object I can set a property on that object for the calculation, then I can display that in the template. OR I can create a list of dictionaries and only get the fields I need to display in each dictionary along with the calculated field. Which is better for performance, and in general practicep  pAn overlysimplified example for clarity I know I can call getAge from the template, what I am really calculated is more complex and for performance I want to do the calculations in the view codep  pmodels.pyp  precodeclass Personmodels.Model     firstname  ...     lastname  ...     dateofbirth  ...     .     .     .     def getAgeself         return ...  return the calculated years since dateofbirth codepre  pviews.pyp  precodedef method1objectpropertyrequest     people  Person.objects.all     for p in people         p.age  p.getAge     return rendertoresponsetemplate.htm, people people  def method2dictionaryrequest     people  Person.objects.all     data  list     for p in people         row  dict         row[firstname]  p.firstname         row[lastname]  p.lastname         row[age]  p.getAge         data.appendrow     return rendertoresponsetemplate.htm, people data codepre  ptemplate.htmp  precodeltulgt      for p in people           p.firstname   p.lastname  Age  p.age       endfor  ltulgt codepre  pBoth methods work just fine so far as I can tell, I was just curious what the preferred method would be and why.

Say I get a QuerySet of codePersoncode objects and want to calculate how many times they have logged into my website in the last 30, 60 and 90 days.

I just wanted to make sure Im not violating some Python standard or cheating the system. Alternately, I could store these other lookups in a dictionary with the object in one keypair, and the various details in separate ones. This is a bit more work in the view, but I was curious if it is better for performance or compliance of standards to do sop  pSorry if my original question was not clear enough, or my example added confusion.p

Negative 4705 pIm developing a standard Azure .NET cloud service with a sql backend. The sql db holds various bits of information including username and password details. Ive a .NET app that communicates with Azure using message encryption over WCF using a custom usernamepassword validator. Also Ive got two mobile apps written for Android and iOS which currently use some web services Ive defined in an small .asmx file legacy code to enable the mobile apps to easily call the API. I was wanting to add authentication into the mobile apps, but am slowly sinking under the weight of information p  pI had thought Azure mobile services were the way to go meaning I would have to rewrite the .asmx file using custom API presumably but this only seems to offer authentication against identity providers like Google, Facebook etc. Ideally Id want to use our sql backend as an identity provider, but have read various articles saying this is very tricky to do. In fact one article suggested using a commercial solution called Auth0. p  pIm not averse to commercial solutions, but really just wondered what the simplest approach to this should be. Azure mobile services or something elsep  pAny help steering me in the right direction would be great.p

I successfully execute these queries with the help of an async taskp  precode    private class TCPQuery extends AsyncTaskltString, String, Stringgt           Override         protected String doInBackgroundString... params                  connect the socket send the query and receive feedback                   Override         protected void onPostExecuteString result                  parse server feedback and build the view               codepre  pThis approach works fine when it comes to single queries that are made only a couple of times during the applications lifetime. What I have trouble implementing is the following a certain view in the application, contains seekbars. So basically, every change of the seekbar value every time the onProgressChange method fires must be sent to the serverno feedback this time, so it can keep track of the actual values.p  pHow would you go about implementing this Of course, no networking in android may be done on the main thread. But here establishing a connection, sending a message and closing the connection every time the value changes is not acceptable. Sliding the bar only a little already results in a dozen such calls in a split second.p  pIve tried approaching this problem by implementing a service. The service had its own socket to communicate with the server. I would connect the socket to the server and keep it open, so that I would be able to call the services send method any time a seekbar change has been made. But that seemed to interfere with the other queries I mentioned before the ones executed with async tasks. I couldnt connect one while the other was active. Now Im not sure whether my service implementation was just bad, or if I am misunderstanding a crucial networking concept here.p  pI have thought of only sending the data onStopTrackingTouch, but that is not really what I am after. Any help would be very much appreciatedp

I also create a layer object called codesubLayercode that will display the final image on the screen. The images orientation is then rotated and corrected, and then I setup a CGRect to crop the part of the image I want to keep.p  pThe most important part are the last 2 statements. I create a CGImageRef called codeimageRefcode using the original UIImage. Then, in the last statement, I set the contents property of codesubLayercode to equal my final image.p  pA little further down in this same view controller, inside of an IBAction I have the following statement which helps me pass the image to my next view controller         codesendFriendsVC.finalPhotoToSend  subLayer.contentscodep  pcodefinalPhotoToSendcode is a property that I have setup in the header file of my next view controller like thisp  precodeproperty nonatomic, retain UIImage finalPhotoToSend codepre  pThe data is successfully passed when I segue to the next view controller, but when I NSLog codefinalPhotoToSendcode, even though it is a UIImage, it prints as this to the console p  precodeltCGImage 0x1563dac0gt codepre  pIn order to upload photos to my backend server service, it requires me to create an object using NSData.

Negative 4705 pWhen I program in Java, I have recently discovered the free unittesting tool Infinitest, and installed it as an Eclipse Plugin. The GUI is minimalistic and looks like this statusbar at bottom of picturep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comyz2uy.png altscreenshot infinitestp  pThe bar is green when all tests pass, and it is red if tests fail.p  pIs there a similar tool that inserts a status bar into Eclipse like this, but works for unit tests written strongin Javascriptstrongp  pI would also be interested in solutions that work for any other language but can be adapted for javascript. And the test runner does not necessarily have to be an eclipse plugin. Im interested in having seamless workflow with instant feedback from the test runner just as in Infinitest. Whenever I save a script file, the  testrunner gets triggered.p

Negative 4705 pIm sure Im missing something obvious but Im unable to get my ViewFlipper to animate smoothly from one layout to the next.p  pMy desire is to have the animation move at a constant speed.

The overall desired effect is to have the flipper animate in perpetuity with no visible stutter or hiccup, so that the two or more layouts just keep moving along, as though on a looped reel.p  pHowever, when I dont set an Interpolation it defaults to some default builtin interpolation that slows down to 0 towards the end.p  pAnd when I do set the Interpolation theres no number I seem to be able to pass in to give me the smooth animation result. 0 stops the animation outright and 1 does seemingly what the default does.p  pWhat am I overlookingp  pheres my animation method that I am passing as part of my custom codeAnimationcode to the codeViewFlippercodep  precodepublic Animation inFromRightAnimationint duration      Animation inFromRight  new TranslateAnimation     Animation.RELATIVETOPARENT,  1.0f, Animation.RELATIVETOPARENT,  0.0f,     Animation.RELATIVETOPARENT,  0.0f, Animation.RELATIVETOPARENT,   0.0f          inFromRight.setDurationduration     AccelerateInterpolator ai  new AccelerateInterpolatortried 0 and 1.0f as params without success      inFromRight.setInterpolatorai      return inFromRight  codepre

Negative 4705 pI was wondering how the processor jumps from a lower memory region into a higher memory region, or the other way around, in a x64 application.p  pThe default mnemonic for a far jump is E9 XXXXXXXX, in x86 as well as x64 bit apps. Doing a far jump on x86 is easy, as you can put the target address directly behind the E9 bit, like sop  precodeFar call  Address   Hex dump          Command                        Comments 002957A1  E8 F15B2900       CALL CamSurveillance.00295BF1  above current code 002957A6  E9 3C562900       JMP  CamSurveillance.0029563C  below current code   Or the short call for comparison  Address   Hex dump          Command                         Comments 002957A1   E8 4B040000      CALL CamSurveillance.00295BF1  above current code 002957A6   E9 91FEFFFF      JMP  CamSurveillance.0029563C  below current code codepre  pYou can also make use of the code segment to create a pointer.p  pStill, when using a x64 bit app, you cannot override that limit of 40 bits. So in order to do a far call or jump to a hardcoded 64 bit address, you would need 64 bits.p  pFor example RIP points to 00FF7A0B.002957A1.  What instructions would RIP set to point to 00000000.003967B1  Or does this mean you cannot make a far jump or call p

Negative 4705 pThis is my first question on this forum, so please forgive any newbie errors. p  pI have .Net code, within a web application, that creates an html table dynamically from data pulled from a database, then streams it to the users web browser to be opened in Excel. This works just fine in Chrome. It also works in IE 11 as long as the user, after clicking the Download link, chooses the Save option saving the file before opening it, rather than the Open option  which tries to read the file being streamed to the client. But in IE 11, if they choose the Open option, they will get a warning from Excel about the format of the file because it is an html file  same thing happens if they save first, and this is acceptable, but when they click Yes to open anyway, they see an Unable to read file. error message.p  pIn one case, I was able to fix this problem by replacing instances if amp in the data with the word and. However, in other cases, I cannot determine what particular data value might be causing the issue. And again, the file opens just fine as long as the user saves it first. In fact, it even works fine when I click Open instead of Save in my development environment  but not when I do it from the test server where the code is deployed.p  pSo, I am looking either for a way to removereplace all problematic data displayed within the td elements of the html table, or, better yet, some way to just make the Open option have the same result as the Save option. Again, the html table content opens just fine as long as the file is saved first.p  pThe html table is generated by a C class, but the page that streams the file is in VB.Net. I dont think the C code would be useful but I can post it in part if anyone thinks it would be, but here is the VB code in relevant part p  pre classlangvb prettyprintoverridecodeResponse.Clear Response.ClearContent Response.ClearHeaders Dim htmlTable As String [snip  populate htmlTable with data from database] Dim fileName As String  Whatever.xls Response.Buffer  false Response.ContentType  applicationvnd.msexcel Response.AppendHeaderContentDisposition, attachment filename amp fileName amp  Response.AddHeaderContentLength, ASCIIEncoding.ASCII.GetByteCounthtmlTable.ToString  Using ms As New MemoryStreamEncoding.ASCII.GetByteshtmlTable   ms.WriteToResponse.OutputStream   Response.Flush End Using codepre  pUPDATE I may have fixed this issue by cleansing the data with the C code below, but I still dont understand why the file ever has to be saved first, which would have made this unnecessary.

Negative 4705 pMy goal was to make a simple log module with a Log class that I could use in other projects to keep track of things.

Negative 4705 pIm trying to implement the Clarke Wright algorithm. The problem I seem to be having is that it merges lots of routes regardless of the tests Ive put into place. Ive been staring at this for a long time, so I thought it may help to cast a fresh pair of eyes over it.p  pInstead of creating routes that are valid ie, the van has enough space to carry everything, it wildly creates routes everywhere regardless of whether its got the capacity or not. p  precodepublic void CWVRSolution     ListltSavingsNodegt savings  new ArrayListltSavingsNodegt

Negative 4705 pLets say I have a makefile a.mk which has a variable named FILES used. a.mk includes b.mk which also does something using FILES as a variable name.

Negative 4705 pI have a mysql table called foods with columns id, name, addinfo, picname, mg1cup, mg100g.  I have a form where the user can submit between 120 food names.  The php file takes the submitted food names in an array called terms[].  I need to search the sql table for all terms and return results for all columns for each of the terms. p  pHowever, the results are only showing the first term submitted, repeated as many times as there are inputs for example, if two words were inputted, the first term gets outputted in the results twice  instead of first word results, then second word results.p  pI dont know what Im doing wrong.

Negative 4705 pOkay the main issue I am having is I have a table that should not have any duplicate entries. This is because I was hoping to have a Primary Key which would be referenced in a separate table. p  pFrom what I understand about normalization it is better to have your database designed in this fashion. So right now I have a table that has a bunch of duplicate entries there should be only 6 unique entries but there are 30 entries, each unique one is repeated 5 times.p  pHow should I fix this Should I fix this when importing the data, or by using a UNIQUE keyword. To note when I tried to use the UNIQUE feature this time around, it gave me an error as the data that I am importing indeed has duplicates entries. p  pEDITp  pThis is what my items looks likep

Negative 4705 pThis question is perhaps aimed at the creator of emReactFXem, but others are welcome to answer.p  pI am currently starting to use emReactFXem for data sharing and event handling within a emJavaFXem application. My question is how can a class subscribe to listen to events from twoor more different codeEventStreamscode. Suppose that in a codeController classcode I have a codetextfieldcode that may be updated with a codenew textStringcode, so this class would implement codeConsumerltStringgtcode. But then you may also want for this codetextfieldcode to be updated with a codenew Integercode for example coming from a totally different source, so it would have to implement codeConsumerltIntegergtcode, only you cant do that because it already implements codeConsumerltStringgtcode.p  pI thought about creating a bundle class with an id fieldwith an codeEnumcode for example and an codeObject fieldcode containing the data, lets name it codeReactFXEventBundlecode. Only instances of this class will be able to be used as codeEventscode, where the consumer can identify the type of Event by analyzing the id field. Therefore, all Consumer classes would implement codeConsumerltReactFXEventBundlegtcode. Would this be the right approachp

Negative 4705 pI have created an IOS game using sprite kit and swift. The game contains sounds and images. The problem I am having is that once the game loads and I tap on a button which triggers the sound for tapping a button, The game freezes for about 12 seconds and then resumes and plays the sound just fine. This only happens one time per running the game, once it unfreezes the game runs smooth and plays sounds just fine. Is there any way around this so that the game will run smooth from the beginning Any advice would be greatly appreciated. p

The program uses the ASCII character set, and adds and subtracts the values accordingly. p  pI have had an attempt at the code, and have two variations, which are very close to working and have a few issues that I am unable to diagnose, I have included the code below for reference, and am wondering if anyone will be able to make suggestions in order to make the program more efficient, as well as helping me diagnose the problem.p  pVariation 1p  precode    def encryptmessage, keyWrd     characters  abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz     enc       for x in message         if x in characters             for y in keyWrd                 crShift  ordy             num  ordx             num  crShift             if num gt ordz                 num  26             elif num lt orda                 num  26             enc  encchrnum         else             enc  enc  x     return enc  def encryptmessage, keyWrd     characters  abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz     enc       for x in message         if x in characters             for y in keyWrd                 crShift  ordy             num  ordx             num  crShift             if num gt ordz                 num  26             elif num lt orda                 num  26             enc  encchrnum         else             enc  enc  x     return enc  def functHandpassThr, message, keyWrd         message  message.lower         if passThr  1                 return encryptmessage, keyWrd         elif passThr  2                 return decryptmessage, keyWrd  def errorerrMSG         if errMSG  1             printnInvalid Data entry             start  def keyPlastermsg, keyWrd     keyword       while lenkeyWrd lt lenmsg         keyword  keyWrd     keyword  keyword[lenmsg]     return keyword   def start     print     try          option  intinputWhat would you like to don1Encryptn2Decryptn3Exitngtgt      except ValueError             error1     if option  1         msg  inputWhat message would you like to encrypt .replace , .lower         keyWrd  inputWhat is the keyword .replace , .lower         keyword           while lenkeyWrd lt lenmsg             keyword  keyWrd         keyword  keyword[lenmsg]         enc  functHand1, msg, keyword         printThe encrypted message is , enc         start     elif option  2         msg  inputWhat message would you like to decrypt .replace , .lower         keyWrd  inputWhat is the keyword .replace , .lower         keyword           while lenkeyWrd lt lenmsg             keyword  keyWrd         keyword  keyword[lenmsg]         msg  functHand2, msg, keyword         printThe decrypted message is , msg          start     elif option  3          printnEXITINGn         raise SystemExit     else         error1  start codepre  pVariation 2p  precodedef menu     try         option  intinputPlease select an optionn1Encryptn2Decryptn3Exitngtgt      except ValueError         printERROR                  raise SystemExit     while option gt 1 and option lt 3         if option  1             menuOpt  1             handlermenuOpt         elif option  2             menuOpt  2             handlermenuOpt         elif option  3             menuOpt  3             handlermenuOpt     else          printERROR                    raise SystemExit  def handlermenuOpt     if menuOpt  1 or menuOpt  2         origInput  inputPlease enter a string .replace , .lower         manipInput  inputPlease enter a keyword .replace , .lower         keyPlastermanipInput, origInput         if menuOpt  1             encmenuOpt, origInput, keyword             printThe encrypted message is , enc         elif menuOpt  2             decmenuOpt, origInput, keyword             printThe decrypted message is , dec         elif menuOpt  3             printEXITING             raise SystemExit  def keyPlastermanipInput, origInput     global keyword     keyword       while lenkeyword lt lenorigInput         keyword  manipInput     keyword  keyword[lenorigInput]     return keyword    def encmenuOpt, origInput, keyword     characters  abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz     enc       for x in origInput         if x in characters             for y in keyword                 crShift  ordy             num  ordx             num  crShift             if num gt ordz                 num  26             elif num lt orda                 num  26             enc  enc chrnum         else             enc  enc  x     return enc  def decmenuOpt, origInput, keyword     characters  abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz     dec       for x in origInput         if x in characters             for y in keyword                 crShift  ordy             num  ordx             num  crShift             if num gt ordz                 num  26             elif num lt orda                 num  26             dec  dec chrnum         else             dec  dec  x     return dec  menu codepre  pThanks in advance.p

In the menu it will have Restaurants Category model which has several Dishes Item model. p  pSite 2 is called Second site and will have Second site displayed as the site name on the home view. In the menu it will have Sports Category model which has several Activities Item model.p  pSite 3 ...p  pSite 4 ...p  pMy problem is how to have each deployment display the correct site name and names for the Categories and Items, depending on the deployment.

Negative 4705 pWhat Im doing is taking a user entered string, creating a packet with the data, then sending the string out to a serial port. I am then reading the data I send via a loopback connector. My send is working flawlessly, however my receive is randomly throwing an arithmetic overflow exception.p  pI say randomly because it is not happening consistently. For example, I send the message hello twice. The first time works fine, the second time outputs nothing and throws an exception. I restart my program, run the code again, and send hello only to receive hell and then an exception. On rare occasion, Ill receive the packet 3 or 4 times in a row without error before the exception. p  pHere is my relevant codep  precodepublic void receivePacketobject sender, SerialDataReceivedEventArgs e      byte[] tempByte  new byte[2]     int byteCount  0      while serialPort1.BytesToRead gt 0              if byteCount lt 1                      tempByte[byteCount]  byteserialPort1.ReadByte                   if byteCount  1                      receivedString  new byte[tempByte[byteCount]]             receivedString[0]  tempByte[0]             receivedString[1]  tempByte[1]                  else if byteCount gt 1                      byte b  byteserialPort1.ReadByte             receivedString[byteCount]  b                   byteCount             int strLen  byteCount  3      tempByte  new byte[strLen]      int newBit  0      for int i  2 i lt strLen1 i              tempByte[newBit]  receivedString[i]         newBit           string receivedText  encoder.GetStringtempByte      SetTextreceivedText.ToString  codepre  pIm well aware that my implementation using byteCount which I use to traverse the byte array is rather sloppy. When I step through the code, I find that when I get the error codebyteCount  1code, which is making strLen a negative number since strLen is codebyteCount  3code, which is done because the packet contains a header, length, and CRC i.e. codebyteCount  3   of actual data bytes receivedcode. This leads to by tempByte having a size of 2, which throws my exceptions. I, however, am having a very hard time figuring out why byteCount is being set to 1.p  pThe code after this basically just traverses the data section of the array, copies it into the tempByte, then is sent off to a function to append the text in another thread.p
Negative 4705 pSimple question Can I use NSInputStream to get data from the streaming APIp  pIf so, can someone outline what this can look like.p  pI have tried something likep  precodetwitterStream  [[NSInputStream alloc]initWithURL[NSURL URLWithStringhttpssitestream.twitter.com1.1site.json]] twitterStream.delegate  self  [twitterStream scheduleInRunLoop[NSRunLoop currentRunLoop]                    forModeNSDefaultRunLoopMode] codepre  pand adding Delegate Methods, but this is not working.

Negative 4705 pI was wondering about the naming conventions in C, specifically where and what gets capitalized. I guess what Im asking is having come from languages like Java and C why are things like stdvector and stdstring are not capitalizedp  pAs a follow up, if I was typedefing a stdstring to be something else in my case a world, should I call it ...p  precode typedef stdstring world codepre  porp  precode typedef stdstring World codepre  pIve looked around at previous posts and style guides several listed below, but none seemed to address this directly links below. The Google guide said The names of all types  classes, structs, typedefs, and enums  have the same naming convention. Type names should start with a capital letter and have a capital letter for each new word. No underscores. So that makes it seem like it should be the latter  but this seems odd since the std library doesnt even slightly follow this convention. Is it just one of those things where a bunch of people wrote the std library before styles were standardized and now for compatibility reason it is too late to changeupdate itp  pThanksp  pPrevious Researchp  ul lia hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4883027cnamingconventionC Naming Conventionali lia hrefhttpgeosoft.nodevelopmentcppstyle.html relnofollowhttpgeosoft.nodevelopmentcppstyle.htmlali lia hrefhttpgooglestyleguide.googlecode.comsvntrunkcppguide.html relnofollowhttpgooglestyleguide.googlecode.comsvntrunkcppguide.htmlali ul

Negative 4705 pI have a .Net 4.5 WinForms application that contains html stored in a database.  The user is presented with the list of pages.  As they click on a row the page is loaded into the WebBrowser.

Negative 4705 pI need to perform an experiment to demonstrate the LRU least recent used eviction behavior of Linux virtual memory management. In order to do so, I wrote the following code to count pages faults using codeusrbintime vcode. It first allocates a continuous chunk of memory 100 pages, then touch every page periodically every codenanoseccode for 1000 times.p  precodedefine npage 1000  int mainint argc, char argv      int n  1000     int nanosec  atoiargv[2]     struct timespec t     t.tvsec  0     t.tvnsec  nanosec      char mem  mallocnpage41024     char tmp     int i     int count  0     whilecount lt n          printf.          fflushstdout         for i  0 i lt npage4096 i4096             tmp  mem[i]                  nanosleepampt, NULL         count           return 0  codepre  pHopefully, the larger codenanoseccode is, the more page faults would occur. However, the result shows that no matter how long up to 1s it sleeps, the number of page faults tend to be the same.p  precodesleep 100 ns     Major requiring IO page faults 0     Minor reclaiming a frame page faults 481 sleep 200 ns     Major requiring IO page faults 0     Minor reclaiming a frame page faults 479  .... sleep 419430400 ns     Major requiring IO page faults 0     Minor reclaiming a frame page faults 483 sleep 838860800 ns     Major requiring IO page faults 0     Minor reclaiming a frame page faults 482 codepre  pThe only reason I would guess is that strongthe execution environment is not memory competitivestrong, i.e. 1000 pages 4MB is fairly small and memory load from other processes is also low so OS choose not to reclaim them even the memory become inactive for a fairly long time the longest inactive time in this case is 838860800 ns  .84 s.p  pSo my question is twofold,p  ol liDo I understand Linux eviction policy correctly For example, how long does a page have to be inactive for the OS to evict it out.li liIs there a standard or commonly used tool to simulate a memory competitive environmentli ol

Why then has Apple make these types structs, not classes It seems like it would have many benefits, such as not having to wrap them in NSValues, not have to use C functions to interact with them, etc.p  pIm sure theyd have a reason. Is it simply the slightly less memory usage Is it just historical Or have I missed something biggerp

Using console.log, the new title and color return correctly, but the start date is the original date, not the new date the event was dragged to. The same for the event data returned in my saveEvents function the new title and color are correct, but not the start date.p  pThe strange thing is, in the 3 ways I log the event.start, only the event.start.format shows the correct new date. How do I get the new date saved so when a call clientEvents, the correct new data is returnedp

Negative 4705 pIve read about escaped fragments, but I dont think that it applies here because what I need to do is to route specific URL routes to certain actions on the same page strongin a SEOfriendly way.strongp  pConsider an example a page has 30 posts in it. The markup is already there, no AJAX magic here. Once a user clicks a URL like codeexample.comtestpostcode, I want to open a popup with the post contents suppose that codetestpostcode is the post slug or any other content identifier.p  pThis applies to posts, image galleries and pretty much any content that I want to show in a popup by matching a URL route to a certain Javascript action. The technical part is a piece of cake, but how would this perform SEOwise I understand that using separate pages for individual posts would probably be best, but is it possible to allow a singlepage website to be crawled for individual posts so that the codetestpostcode accessed through codeexample.comtestpostcode via Javascript ends up as a separate link in Google search resultsp

Negative 4705 pI am trying to design a mechanism to allow cooperation of many processes  goroutines. There are two classes of processes  providers and users. Providers put bids for their services into a queue and users take waiting bids and start working with providers. However, a user may not like a bid and then two things should happenp  ul liThis bid should return to the queue. It should be placed at the beginning of the queue li liThe user should be given the next bid in the queue li ul  pIdeally, I would like to avoid a central process that coordinates the communication between providers and users.  Another way of thinking about this problem is to imagine a peekable queue or channel. A concept similar to the way AWS Kinesis works. A reader can get an access to peek into the head of the queue. As this reader is peeking, no other readers can see the item. It the reader likes the item, then it removes it from the queue. If not the reader releases the lock on the item and another reader can peek. p  pAny ideas how to best implement this behavior in Go using channels and goroutines p

Negative 4705 pI have recently started working on a Java project that is already with a sizeable codebase developed by a team over 3 months.

Negative 4705 pMy Audio Streaming App which has a single strongPlay  Pausestrong Button and works fine. However I have little problem while using the codeplayer.pausecode property. Sometimes the stream does not continue after pressing play Button and especially less often it happens when application comes to foreground after being sent to background  for example user opened another music app, now he wants to resume my app and wants to continue again.

Negative 4705 pI have some collections which are related to others through an ID.p  pFor instance, I have collections codePostcode and codeCommentscode. I want to display the number of comments to each posts. Therefore, I have a field in codePostcode called codenumCommentscode. I could update this number in a method every time a comment with same codepostIdcode is either inserted og removed but I will instead use some hooksobservers to ensure the number is always updated.p  pTherefore, I have created a file codeserverobservers.jscode with contentp  precodeComments.find.observe   added functiondocument      Posts.update postId document.postId ,  inc  numComments 1     ,   changed functiondocument    ,   removed functiondocument      Posts.update postId document.postId ,  inc  numComments 1     ,  codepre  pI like this kind of solution but is it a good way to do itp  pMy problem is that since I implemented this functionality, the console window prints an awful lot of errorswarnings. I suspect it is because of the observers.p  pIn the documentation a hrefhttpdocs.meteor.comfullobserve relnofollowhttpdocs.meteor.comfullobservea, it saysp  blockquote   pobserve returns a live query handle, which is an object with a stop method. Call stop with no arguments to stop calling the callback functions and tear down the query. The query will run forever until you call this ..p blockquote  pI am not sure what it means but I think the observers should be stopped manually.p

Shouldnt the ready function be called before the load functionp  pMy hope was that the ready function would only fire once per site visit, and so I could [re]set the cookie val to 1 then, and then the load function would run every time the form was submitted N times per site visit, thus knowing how many rows would be needed to add back to the table. IOW, the table always starts with two rows the user can add a third and then a fourth row via btnAddFoapalRow. The problem arises in that the dynamically added rows are removed with each form submit, and so I want to programmatically add them back following form submission, and the way to know how many to add back is theoretically by querying the cookie val.p  pSo what am I doing wrong or misunderstanding herep  h2UPDATEh2  pNow for some reason the ready function emisem being reached I emamem seeing the alert, although I made no changes to the jQuery. Maybe its being affected by the phase of the moon or has been subjected to some internal smelling salts of some sort.p

Negative 4705 pI want to create a login desktop app based on node webkit. I see a tutorial using a module called diskdb to store user data locally. My question is its local storage in each endusers PC, right So does this mean if someone sign up in one PC but he cant login in another PC In real product should we use something like MongoDB hosted in cloud to store user data p  pSorry Im pretty new to desktop apps. I think desktop app has to exchange lots of data with database in cloud, is this implemented by direct db manipulation or webservices Or there are other ways to do it. p  pThanks in advance for any suggestion p

Negative 4705 pI understand that Vaadin uses some logic to only expose the UI code and then calls the server to access the code through Javascript. However lets say I have a codeListenercode for example with some code that references other classes. So lets say I have something likep  precodePojoClass data  DatabaseClass.getDataFromDatabase doSomeProcessingOnDatadata .. myTextField.setValuedata.getSomeValue .. codepre  pNow how I can be sure that the code behind codeDatabaseClasscode is not exposed as Javascript. I assume this just happens, but more specifically how can say the codedoSomeProcessingOnDatadatacode method which may have calls to say 45 different classes that has some internal IP property not be exposed I understand codePojoClasscode will be exposed but I dont want the internals of codedoSomeProcessingOnDatadatacode to be exposed.p

Negative 4705 pIve hit a wall trying to create a trigger for my table. I have a donation table that has a column firstdonation that is checked Y or N depending whether it is a donors first donation or not.

So if a donor submits a new donation or it is their first donation the column firstdonation is adjusted to reflect Y or N. My first attempt at triggers and it did not seem too daunting at first and the language seemed easier than my last book on Java Script.

Negative 4705 h1The Questionh1  pI think I have figured out a way that, near as I can tell, allows you to write completely typeagnostic code that makes a copy of a variable of arbitrary type on the stack in quotes because C standard does not actually require there to be a stack, so what I really mean is that its copied with the auto storage class in local scope. Here it isp  precode Saveduplicate thingToCopy  char copyPtr[sizeofthingToCopy] memcpycopyPtr, ampthingToCopy, sizeofthingToCopy   modify the thingToCopy variable to do some work do NOT do operations directly on the data in copyPtr, thats just a storage bin.    Restore old value of thingToCopy  memcpyampthingToCopy, copyPtr, sizeofthingToCopy codepre  pFrom my limited testing it works and near as I can tell it should work on all standardscompliant C implementations, but just in case I missed something, Id like to knowp  ul liIs this completely in line with the C standard I believe this should be good all the way from C89 through to the modern stuff, and if not, is it possible to fix and howli liWhat limitations on usage does this method force upon itself in order to stay standardscompliant  ul liFor example, as I understand it, I am safe from alignment issues so long as I never use the chararray tempcopies directly  just as bins to save to and load from with memcpy. But I couldnt pass those addresses to other functions expecting pointers to the type Im working with, without risking alignment issues obviously syntactically I could do it perversely by first getting a codevoid code from the codechar code, without even specifying the exact type Im working with, but the point is that I think I would be triggering undefined behavior by doing so.li ulli liIs there is a more clean andor performant way to achieve the same thingli ul  pGCC 4.6.1 on my armel v7 test device, with O3 optimization, produced identical code to regular code using normal assignments to temporary variables, but it could be that my test cases were just simple enough that it was able to figure it out, and that it would get confused if this technique were used more generally.p  pAs a bonus passing interest, Im curious if this would break in mostlyCcompatible languages the ones I know of are C, ObjectiveC, D, and maybe C, though mentions of others are welcome too.p  h1Rationaleh1  pThis is why I think the above works, in case you find it helpful to know where Im coming from in order to explain any mistakes I may have madep  pThe C standards byte in the traditional sense of smallest addressable unit of memory, not in the modernized 8 bits meaning is the codecharcode type  the codesizeofcode operator produces numbers in units of codecharcode. So we can get exactly the smallest size of storage that we can work with in C needed for an arbitrary variables type by using the codesizeofcode operator on that variable.p  pThe C standard guarantees that pretty all pointer types can be converted implicitly into a codevoid code but with a change of representation if their representation is different but incidentally, the C standard guarantees that codevoid code and codechar code have identical representations.p  pThe name of an array of a given type, and a pointer to that same type, can basically be treated identically as far as the syntax is concerned.p  pThe codesizeofcode operator is figured out at compiletime, so we can do codechar foo[sizeofbar]code without depending on the effectively nonportable VLAs.p  pTherefore, we should be able to declare an array of chars that is the minimum size necessary to hold a given type.p  pThus we should be able to pass the address of the variable to be copied, and name of the array, to codememcpycode as I understand it, the array name is implicitly used as a codechar code to the first element of the array. Since any pointer can be implicitly converted to a codevoid code with change of representation is necessary, this works.p  pThe memcpy should make a bitwise copy of the variable we are copying to the array. Regardless of what the type is, any padding bits involved, etc, the codesizeofcode guarantees well grab all the bits that make up the type, including padding.p  pSince we cant explicitly usedeclare the type of the variable we just copied, and because some architectures might have alignment requirements for various types that this hack might violate some of the time, we cant use this copy directly  wed have to codememcpycode it back into the variable we got it from, or one of the same type, in order to make use of it. But once we copy it back, we have an exact copy of what we put there in the first place. Essentially, we are freeing the variable itself to be used as scratch space.p  h1Motivation or, Dear God Whyh1  pI like to write typeindependent code when useful, and yet I also enjoy coding in C, and combining the two largely comes down to writing the generic code in functionlike macros you can then reclaim typechecking by making wrapper function definitions which call the functionlike macro. Think of it like really crude templates in C.p  pAs Ive done this, Ive run into situations where I needed an additional variable of scratch space, but, given the lack of a portable typeof operator, I cannot declare any temporary variables of a matching type in such generic macro snippets of code. This is the closest thing to a truly portable solution that Ive found.p  pSince we can do this trick multiple times large enough char array that we can fit several copies, or several char arrays big enough to fit one, as long as we can keep our codememcpycode calls and copy pointer names straight, its functionally like having an arbitrary number of temporary variables of the copied type, while being able to keep the generic code typeagnostic.p  pP.S. To slightly deflect the likelyinevitable rain of judgement, Id like to say that I do recognize that this is seriously convoluted, and I would only reserve this in practice for very welltested library code where it significantly added usefulness, not something I would regularly deploy.p

Negative 4705 pI have set standard VCL codeTDateTimePickercode  codeMaxDatecode property to codeDatecode  e.g.p  precodeDTPicker.MaxDate  Date codepre  pHowever, there is a problem. If I now set the date to be the current onep  precodeDTPicker.Date  Date codepre  pIt will not accept it. The control simply stays at the date which is set at the design time. I can solve it by setting MaxDate to be codeDate  1code and then setting the codeDatecode property works fine and shows todays date, but then user is able to select tomorrows date. I also tried to set codeMaxDatecode to codeDate  0.99999999code but that also is of no help.p  pI use Delphi 2010 and CBuilder 2010 if this is a bug in either of them.p  pAny ideas how to prevent selecting any date beyond today and set the control date to todays datep  pChanging the date results in  Failed to set calendar date or time.p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pI managed to make it work as followingp  ol liopen dropdown in TDateTimePicker during runtime and intentionally select Todays date click on already selected Todays dateli liafter that select any past dateli liclick button which has the code to reset the date and then it works.li ol  pMy solution will likely be to use rangecheck before closing the form, as it seems that codeMaxDatecode is useless, at least with this version of Delphi.p
