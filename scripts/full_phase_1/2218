Positive 2218 pI am using the Javascript SDK to log in to facebook and request publishactions permissions for my application.  I have everything working and can post photos to my application no problem.  I use my own dialog to let them set a comment and set privacy setting to Just Me, Friends or Public.p  pWhen a user first attempts to connect to facebook from my web app, they are asked to set the privacy setting level when posting photos Just Me, Friends, Public, etc.  The issue I am having is that I want to be able to get that information later when the user posts a photo through my app so I can see what privacy setting are available for my dialog.  For examplep  pA user logs in to my app and for publishactions chooses Friends as the privacy setting.  Later on if they are running my app, I give them a choice to pick Only Me, Friends or Public but I need to know that Public is not allowed for that user.  Currently if they choose public it will default back to Friends since that is what was picked when they connected through my app initially.p  pI have found examples of accessing the permissions in the privacysetting table using FQL but not for a particular app also that looks to be going away with versions after 2.0 according to a hrefhttpsdevelopers.facebook.comdocsreferencefqlprivacysetting relnofollowhttpsdevelopers.facebook.comdocsreferencefqlprivacysettinga.p  pI have not been able to find an end point in the Graph Api to provide the apps privacy setting for a given app.p  pWould appreciate if anyone knows how to get this.p

Positive 2218 pThis is going to be a lot of questions in one. I am very confused with facebook. I have a facebook page and I am trying to integrate facebook comments in my WordPress site with this plugin a hrefhttpswordpress.orgpluginsfacebookcommentsplugin relnofollowFacebook Commentsa. This plugin asks me for an API key and sends me to the page a hrefhttpsdevelopers.facebook.comapps relnofollowhttpsdevelopers.facebook.comappsa in order to create an app and get an API key. But when I try to create an app it tells me p  blockquote   pNot Authorized To Manage Apps This account is not authorized to manage   apps. Please use your verified personal Facebook account to create and   manage your apps.p blockquote  pI have been investigating and seems that my problem is because I have a business account on  facebook. So my questions are  How works facebook comments in WordPress are comments made in WordPress published in facebook, facebook comments are going to be published in my WordPress or both of them  Is there a way to integrate facebook comments on my website with a business account  If I create the page with my personal profile and then create an app to integrate the comments in facebook, will this facebook comments on WordPress go to be related to my profile or to my pagep  pLike you can see, I am very confused on how to go about connecting WordPress and facebook. Any extra explanation apart from this questions about facebook pages and how to connect with WordPress will be great.p  pThanks in advancep
Positive 2218 pI have to write the server side of an Android application. I dont know much actually, anything about Android development. If an application has the login via Facebook icon, what happens emexactlyem on the serverp  pI assume the app, after authentication, would contact the app server and tell it I am Facebook user ID XXXXXX but whats stopping the app from saying so Wont the server need to hear that the application is authenticated emdirectlyemp  pThe normal way, with a Facebook login button on a web form, its more natural as the app redirects to Facebook, and then Facebook redirects back to the application once login is successful or not. But... what happens with a stand alone application, effectivelyp  pPlease note that I am after the emserverem side of things.p

Negative 2218 pWPF XAML, I have a custom control I have written that wraps lookups. In typical government fashion, they have a lookup table for all possible lookups. My custom control will throw a popup overlay asking them to select from the items in the list.

I can use this fine and be confident that my ViewModel always has the selected id assigned to that property.p  pBut now I am doing the Edit Existing Form mode where Im loading data back from database and setting the properties in the view model. So I set the SelectedHarvestMethod and that code works fine breakpoint hit in setter but the resulting setter on SelectedLookupValueId is not called  the value never goes through.p  pSelectedLookupValueId is a DP on the controls view modelp  precodepublic static readonly DependencyProperty SelectedLookupValueIdProperty        DependencyProperty.RegisterSelectedLookupValueId, typeofint, typeofLookupSelector, new UIPropertyMetadata0      public int SelectedLookupValueId                get  return int GetValueSelectedLookupValueIdProperty            set  SetValueSelectedLookupValueIdProperty, value ViewModel.SetPreSelectedLookupValueIdvalue        codepre  pTheres no errors in the output window or event log or written on the bottom of my shoe.

Negative 2218 pWe have created a portlet.  We then went through some pain to move images from our portlet into a theme created for our portal vendor.  I disagreed with this move, thinking that having application images within the theme overstepped the bounds of the theme.  We are now having issues caused by having the images in the theme rather than the portlet.  A good part of that is because of our implementation, but I believe a portion of those problems are simply because the theme shouldnt contain application images.p  pHaving said that, if you look at themes for the firefox browser, they override the images within the action bar, like the home, back, refresh buttons.  Of course, one large difference there is that firefox is an application, not a web application, but does that really make a difference in where a theme should begin and endp  pstrongIm not a webui guru, and would like some input from the community on guidelines for what is appropriate in a theme and what should remain part of the web application, and why.strongp  pMy initial take is that application images those that are a part of application presentation, and would be particular to a single application should be part of the application, and layout, color schemes, and fonts should be part of the theme.  If thats the case, how can you make an application that includes application images look good in themes with vastly different color schemesp  pOur environment is Liferay portal, so it could be that the image handling within themes in liferay is different than other systems, but I would be interested in examples from other systems as well.p

Negative 2218 pMicrosoft has made saving objects very easy with their LINQ to SQL mapping. p  pHowever, I would sometimes like something a little more lightweight, i.e. the ability to save objects to a file when an application closes, and read them back in again.

Of course, one could argue that XML is the new ascii, and we still have the problem of defining the data schema etc. ...p  pIs there a predefined method of doing this, or am I going to have to manually figure out an XML data format and write routines to readwrite them, i.e. by constructing a DOM equivalent and then saving as XMLp

Negative 2218 pI am getting started with Entity Framework 4, using modelfirst development. I am building a simple WPF demo app to learn the framework. My app has two entities, Topic and Note. A Topic is a discussion topic it has Title, Text, and DateRevised properties. Topic also has a Notes collection property. a Note has DateCreated and Text properties.p  pI have used EF4 to create an EDM and data store for the app. Now I need to add just a bit of intelligence to the entities. For example, the property setter for the Topic.Text property needs to update the Topic.DateRevised property, and a Note needs to set its DateCreated property when it is instantiatedpretty simple stuff. I assume that I cant modify the generated classes directly, because my code would be lost if the entities are regenerated.p  pIs this the sort of thing that I can implement by modifying the T4 template that EF4 uses to generate the entities In other words, can a T4 template be modified to add my code for performing these tasks to the entities that it generates Can you refer me to a good tutorial or explanation of how to get startedp  pMost of what I have found so far talks about how to add a tt file to an EDM, so I can do that.

Negative 2218 pI have a powershell 2.0 script on an XP OS. The purpose of the script is to extract data from an old database Sybase and populate a SQL Server 2008 database. The model that I am using is to create OLEDB connections to the Sybase database. The script calls a series of stored procedures from the Sybase database. The results are used to create an XML string. The XML string is queried for the input data for the SQL Server stored procedures. AFter each data element is created in the SQL Server database the XML string is saved to a file. Every database connection is closed after execution is completed. It is simple model, but uses staggering amounts of memory. For transferring only 1000 rows of data the script memory footprint grows to 3G. When the script completes the memory does not drop. In an attempt to rectify this problem I have added logic to free every variable when not used and call garbage collection in every finally clause of every try block. I am aware that this is overkill, but am trying to find anything that will reduce the memory usage. I am in the processing of looking for a memory trace tool, but I am also looking for expert opinions as to possibly start tracking down this critical issue. I know I am missing something obvious so any advice would be appreciated.p
Negative 2218 pHey I have 3 tables called STUDENT, COURSE and ENROLLMENT. STUDENT has a PK of SIDstudent ID and COURSE has PK of CIDcourse ID. In enrollment it only has SID and CID. I have an object data source to show all the students name in text, and SID as the value in a drop down menu and it will show which courses he is registered in when clicked, using a datagrid and another object data source. I wont to have the student to have multiple courses to be registered too, but I cant do that because you cannot have the same ID in the COURSE table, so every student is only registered to one course. p  pIs there some sort of option to have same IDs in a tablep  pIf not, then I must some how manipulate the string in CID in the COURSE table because all the courses start with ISDVXXX or ITSXXXX or HGFXXXX. This may be hard to understand but hopefully someone will help. p  pAn example may help So if a student named Joe with a SID of 123 is registered to ISDV, he will be registered to all the courses that start with ISDV. But my problem is that my COURSE table has to have unique ID for each course such as ISDV123, ISDV346, ISDV395 etc... so this also ruins my enrollment table because I cannot simply have ISDV in there, it needs a specific course but he is registered to all of them. Any more clarification will be given P Thanks...p

The page should asynchronously check ever couple of seconds to see if they have completed the required steps and their status has been set to 1 or active in the database.p  pCompleting the ajax request seems pretty straightforward  the timing however, I am a little thick about.p  pAlso, what is it that I am trying to do with the information I am retrieving  great, so the user has been set to active and I can retrieve that value  but then what do I use to redirect them to the final or thank you page Is it a javascript variable that should hold the value then redirectp  pSorry if this seems a little discombobulated, but this is my first try at Ajax amp timed refreshesresponses.p

Negative 2218 pQuestion 1p  pI have some XMLbased layouts which work fine on phones. But when it comes to tablets, the layouts become very wide. There is nothing wrong with this, it just looks very ... unusual. So Im thinking the easiest way to work around this is to limit the layouts width from XML like using an attribute androidmaxWidth480dp and be centered in the screen. But I cant find a way to do this, could somebody helpp  pI thought about providing a layoutxlarge folder, but given the number of layouts I have, this is troublesome and adds to maintainence burden.p  pQuestion 2p  pOn the 3.0 emulator, I saw that the original Settings app is, because of the extralarge screen, changed so that the screen is split into two parts. The lefthand parts shows the available settings, and the righthand part shows the options of the selected setting. That is, the original twolevel activities are now combined into one. My quesion is Is there an easy way, without too much programming, to achieve this What I expect is when the program detects that its running on an xlarge screen, it calls some method and, voila, two activities become one. Is this possible If not, how to achieve the lsefright split screenp  pThank you.p

Negative 2218 pIs there any way to change the touch priority for cocos2d iOS sprites What I have are multiple cards on the screen and they are arrayed in an arc, just like it would when you hold them in your hands. So in this setup, they overlap, and I need to recognize on which card the touch was made. I could measure the coordinates of each vertex of cards and determine the visible area of a card and then check if the touch was made inside that area couldnt I but I thought there would be an easier way to deal with this, say changing the touch priority Which means that the card closest to the screen would have the highest priority and itll keep decreasing along the way into the background, so that even if the touch was made on 2 sprites at once the above and below one, it would be registered only on the sprite with higher priority.p  pReading on the internet only revealed ways to change the priority for a sprite and layer so that it defines whether the touch was made on the layer or the sprite, but thats not what I want.p  pThanks a lot. p

Because the client interacts   talks with its bean, this state is often called the conversational   state. As its name suggests, a session bean is similar to an   interactive session.

For example, in most programming languages, a function call would look like thisp  precodeprintHello, world codepre  pWas this decision based on algebraic functions from the time before programming was around Perhaps the question could be asked in a different way if this were true. In my opinion, brackets are easier to type. They are typically closer or just as close as the parentheses keys plus, they dont require a shift key.

Negative 2218 pI have a JTextArea of a fixed size 300 x 33 with line wrapping enabled that I have added inside of a JPanel. Whenever one types inside it and goes past the last visible row in this case the second one, the text continues outside of the text areas view, and is hidden.p  pIs there anyway to limit the text entered inside of a JTextArea to the size of the text area rather than to the number of characters that it contains making it dependent to the different space that each character of different fonts occupiesp  pEdit I forgot to mention that not fixing the size of the JTextArea and providing row and column numbers in the constructor would result in the text area to stretch and fill the JPanel holding it. I believe this is due to the fact that the panels layout is a BoxLayout.p

Negative 2218 pI am aware that questions about recurring events are common but I have not been able to find one with an answer to this specific question about recurring events other than those to do with calendar apps. The main difference being that the events in our app. will only ever be seen either in reports or by themselves rather than in a calendar format although in many ways they are very similar, maybe just with less of the baggage associated with calendars.p  pIn a similar way to a calendar app. events can either occur on a oneoff basis or can be recurring E.g. every Thursday or first Monday of every month, until some preset time in the future.p  pThe events are stored in an event table which contains the start and end dates and the recurrency type id. If the recurrency type is None then the start and end dates will be the same. The event table holds an id to a separate table which holds the event type name, E.g. Meeting or Weekly reportp  pThere is a further table which contains the list of recurrency types E.g. No recurrence, Every Monday, First Monday of month and Last Saturday of month.p  pTo make lookups easier another table contains a list of dates from 1960 to 2060 along with relevant information about each date, like whether it is a Monday, and which occurrence of Monday it is in the month.p  pThis allows a lookup like codepre SELECT DISTINCTe.eventid,n.nameid,n.firstname,n.lastname,d.dt,r.recurring FROM dates d  LEFT JOIN recurringtypes r  if event recurring every week E.g. Every Monday  ON r.rectypeid BETWEEN 2 AND 8 AND r.day  d.dow   if event recurring every month E.g. First Monday, every month  OR r.rectypeid BETWEEN 9 AND 36 AND r.day  d.dow AND r.occurrence  d.occurrence   if event recurring every last week of month E.g. Last Monday, every month  OR r.rectypeid  37 AND r.day  d.dow and r.islast  d.islast LEFT JOIN events e on e.rectypeid  r.rectypeid LEFT JOIN eventtypes t ON e.eventtypeid  t.eventtypeid LEFT JOIN names n ON e.namesid  n.namesid WHERE d.dt BETWEEN 20120201 AND 20120501 ORDER BY d.dt precodep  pWhich is exactly what is required for finding recurring events, giving output like codepre   eventid    nameid         lastname           firstname  dt          recurring                          3291788        1728449  smith              zoe        20120202  First Thursday, every month       3291797        1765432                                20120205  First Sunday, every month         3291798        1730147                                20120205  First Sunday, every month         3291803        1790061  Carpenter          Richie     20120206  Every Monday                      3291805        1790061  Carpenter          Richie     20120208  Second Wednesday, every month     3291803        1790061  Carpenter          Richie     20120213  Every Monday                      3291799        1790061  Carpenter          Richie     20120215  Third Wednesday, every month      3291803        1790061  Carpenter          Richie     20120220  Every Monday                   precodep  pTo get none recurring events a simpler query can be used codepre SELECT n.nameid,n.lastname,n.firstname,e.firstdate,e.eventid,No as Recurring FROM events e LEFT JOIN names n ON n.names  e.namesid  AND e.rectypeid lt 1  AND e.firstdate BETWEEN 20120201 AND 20120501  AND e.eventid IS NOT NULL ORDER BY e.firstdate precode This gives output very similar to the first query but, crucially, the dates are from the events table rather than the dates table.p  pstrongMy question is How can I combine these queries to come up with one list that contains all the events, both recurring and nonrecurring in date orderstrongp  hr  pThese are the tables and shortened selections from them, some columns and all indexes have been removed for brevity .

Negative 2218 pSo I have a whole bunch of fields for each user in my redis database, and I want to be able to retrieve all their records and display them. The way I do it, is store a set of all userids, When i want all their records, I recursively iterate the set grabbing their records using the userids in the set and adding them to a global array, then finally returning this global array. Anyway I dont particularly like this method and would like to hear some suggestions of alternatives, I feel there must be better functionality in node.js or redis for this very problem.

Negative 2218 pSome advice on how to even properly describe these relationships would be a great start. Something accurately described is a problem looking for a solution. I have entities User and Login, where Login describes basically a login session for one user. So, User normally has many Login instances. This relationship is only described on the Login side with a required, single User navigation property, and there is an implied, but not declared, Login collection on the User side. p  pThen, for the other relationship, a User is created under authorization of a Login, so this relationship is described on the User side, with a Login navigation property, and there is an implied, but not User collection on the Login side.p  pI dont do much DB modelling outside of using the DB tools, and they always just get relationships right for me, but now, I have to map these relationships for code first, using fluent mapping. How do I described these two relationships, what are the principle and dependent sides, and what are the multiplicities herep

Negative 2218 pSo, Ive been trying for a few hours now to workaround something that should theoretically be very simple. Lets take this sample urlp  precodehttpsample.comproductsintexasdallas codepre  pThis maps onto a specific routep  precoderoutes.MapRoute     products,     productsinstatecity,     new  controller  Products, action  List, state  UrlParameter.Optional, city  UrlParameter.Optional  codepre  pIn my action method, I can do lookups to make sure texas and dallas exist, and that dallas exists within Texas. Thats all fine and dandy. However, in the situation where the city doesnt exist either because the geo is incorrect, or mispelled, I want it to back up the state level. Examplep  precodehttpsample.comproductsintexasdallax codepre  pThat should issue a redirect to p  precodehttpsample.comproductsintexas codepre  pThe easy way to do this was to simply issue a Redirect call like sop  precodereturn Redirectproductsin  stateName codepre  pHowever, Im trying to decouple this from the URL structure for example, if we ever decided to change how the route looks say, change the pattern to codeproductsaroundstatecitycode, then I would have to know that I need to make updates to this controller to fix the URL redirect. p  pIf I can make a solution that just inspects the route values and can figure things out, then I dont have to worry if I change the route pattern, because the route values could still be figured out. p  pIdeally, I would have liked to do something like thisp  precodereturn RedirectToRoutenew  controller  Products, action  List, state  state  codepre  pNote, that is is a simplified example the required route pieces like controller name and action method name would be determined by Generic argument and Expression inspection respectively. p  pThat actually performs the redirect, strongHOWEVERstrong, the route values from the current request get appended onto the redirect and thus you get in a redirect loop note that I didnt include the city route value in the route object. strongHow do I stop the city route value from being included in this redirectstrongp  pIve tried the following things to get rid of the route valuep  ol liCompose my own codeRouteValueDictionarycode  anonymous route data object and pass that to the overload of codeRedirectToRoutecode. li liCreate my own action result to inspect codeRouteTable.Routescode and find the route myself, and do the replacement of the tokens myself. This seems the most kludgy, and would seem to be reinventing the wheel. li liMake a method like codeRedirectWithoutcode that takes a key value and calls codeRedirectToRouteResult.RouteValues.Removekeycode  which also didnt work. li liIve also attempted to add a null value for the key I dont want to add however, this alters the route to something that isnt correct  ie codenew  controller  Products, action  List, state  stateName, city  stringnull code issues a redirect to codeProductsListstateTexascode which is not the right URL. li ol  pIt all seems to stem from the RedirectToRoute taking the current request context to construct the virtual path data. Is there a workaroundp

Negative 2218 pSimple question. I have a ActiveRecord model that I want to perform post processing on AFTER the record is saved. So in the model I have a queueforprocessing method that sticks a job onto my Resque queue. To make this execute after my record is successfully persisted I have written the following in my modelp  precodeaftercreate queueforprocessing codepre  pPretty simple. I had thought that everything was working as expected EXCEPT that last night my redis server went down and things went awry. My expectations were that the record would still be saved and I could process the job later manually. But the queueforprocessing method is throwing an exception expected behavior and stopping the record from saving.p  pAm I misunderstanding how aftercreate works Or is my understanding correct and something funky happeningp  pThanks.p
Negative 2218 pI have a bunch of codeUIViewControllercodes subclasses lets call them codeMainFormcode, codeDetailFormcode, codeMoreMinorDetailscode.

Then on a button on the codeDetailFormcode launches codeMoreMinorDetailscode. And of course, I should be able to go back down to the codeMainFormcode.p  pNote that there arent any codeUINavigationControllercode objects anywhere in sight.br What is the accepted pattern to move between codeUIViewControllercodes in a manner described abovep  pOr am I going about it in the wrong way Ill be happy with either XCode or MonoTouch based explanation.p

Negative 2218 pI maintain the website of my sports club. I recently switched to joomla and try now to set up the pages. Although Im pretty new to joomla and the extension development, I have experience in phpMYSQL and already developed some minor modules.p  pWhat I want to do, is having a pagearticle for every team of the club. The pages look all about the same. They are holding further information of the players, scores, etc. and maybe later some kind of newsbox, where the coach of the team can post stuff. All the information is in a couple of DB tables for each team. Up to now I created some modules, which show the content the way I want and it works fine for one team. I install the module, connect it to the team page and enter the name of the DB table in the backend of the module.  But I have to do that for every team, so I get 20 modules of the same kind that just differ in the DB name parameter and pages on which they are displayed. It would be a pain to update every module each time.p  pIs it possible to get the DB table name for a variable from the article My research wasnt successful on this matter. Would it be better to develop a component, but that would lead to the same problem, right Do I need to create a plugin which holds all the information of each team, and then the module is the same on each team page but gets the DB table name from the pluginp  pThanks p

Negative 2218 pA view model binds to the wrong codeUIElementcode if it has the same properties of another view model in the collection.p  pI have a codeCanvascode control that represents a matrix and this canvas is bound to a collection of rectangle view models. Each rectangle view models relates to a model which has a Move method that sets the coordinates for the model which in turn tells the rectangle where to move on the matrix x,y.p  precodepublic class RectangleModel      public void Move               Logic to find out where to move          sets x,y coordinates for the model         this.Location.X  x         this.Location.Y  y       codepre  pThe Canvas View Model has a DispatcherTimer which when executed loops through every rectangle view model in the ObservableCollection of the canvas and calls the MoveModel method which in turn calls the Move method on the rectangle model it references.p  precodepublic class CanvasViewModel     private void MoveAllRectangles            forint i  0 i lt obsCol.Size i                    obsCol[i].MoveModel           public class RectangleViewModel      private RectangleModel InstanceModel             get return this.instanceModel         set this.instanceModel  value           public int XPos             get                   return this.InstanceModel.Location.X                     public int YPos             get                   return this.InstanceModel.Location.Y                    public void MoveModel              this.InstanceModel.Move         NotifyOfPropertyChangestring.Empty       codepre  pThis works fine and every second all the rectangles on the canvas move to an adjacent tile on the matrix. That is until a rectangle moves to a tile already occupied by another rectangle view model with same XPos, YPos properties, once this occurs both the rectangles get bound to the same view model so it seems and once the timer executes both rectangles move to the same location. So if I start with five rectangles on the canvas, eventually they will all end up combining and only 1 rectangle will be left moving around on the canvas.p  pDebugging the problem results in rectangles to move around correctly, if a rectangle ends up in another rectangles tile then the next time iteration the rectangle will simply move out of the tile and carry on correctly.p  pAny help would be very much appreciated.    p

Negative 2218 pI wanted to ask if anyone knows about any Java 7 issues with FTP Ive used both the Sun Net and Apache Commons Net libraries and both perform as expected on Java 6. But when I switch my dev environment Eclipse to 1.7, the same operations perform really slow about 4.5 to 8KBs, and these are to localhost servers and another server within the LAN.p  pIve tried buffered streams, bytetobyte transfer, turning the Nagle Algorithm off, and using the Apache convenience method storeFile, with the latter finally performing to speed on localhost but slowing down again to a crawl on a remote server. I also set all machines to turn off stateful FTP filtering.p  precode    InputStream is  null     OutputStream os  null     try          is  new BufferedInputStreamprepareInputStreamdata         os  new BufferedOutputStreamprepareOutputStreamdata         if is  null  os  null              log.errorCant build connection             return                   byte[] buf  new byte[4096]         int c  1          while c gt 0              c  is.readbuf             if c gt 0             os.writebuf, 0, c             data.incrCurrentPosition             fireStateChangeddata                  data.incrCurrentPosition      catch IOException e          log.errore.getMessage, e         setEnabledfalse        catch Exception e          log.errore.getMessage, e      finally          if is  null              try                  is.close              catch IOException e                  e.printStackTrace                               if os  null              try                  os.close              catch IOException e                  e.printStackTrace                       codepre  pAs can be seen, this is pretty standard implementation code. Again, in Java 6, things zip by really quick. In Java 7, it slows down by a factor of 10 to 20 for both the Sun and Apache Commons libraries. Using an FTP client like FileZilla confirms that FTP is functioning normally, so I think it really has something to do with Java 7. I dug as far as I could online for any mention of a problem but, mostly, the things I saw were about the Java 7 and Windows 7 firewall conflict.p  pThanks in advance for any insight given.p

The code below works when session management uses CF session management.p  pMy assumption is that the cfclientid is no longer the correct value to pass to the remote method  as it is generated using cfid and cftoken.p  pHow do I successfully implement J2EE session management and utilize remote cfc methods with verifyclient Or can it not be done Using CF tag cfajaxproxy is not an option.p  pThe example code below demonstrates how to use jQuery ajax to call a remote cfc method with verifyclienttrue, even though CF documentation indicates that the use of cfajaxproxy is required. This is not the case. Thanks to Ray Camden and DWMommy.  This leads me to believe that there may also be a workaround to implement a similar method for verifying a client when using J2EE sessions.p  pThanks in advancep  precodeltscript srcpluginsjquery1.7.2.min.js typetextjavascript languageJavascriptgtltscriptgt ltcfajaximport gt ltscriptgt function              .ajax                 url test.cfc,                     type get,                 dataType json,                 data                      method sayHello,                     yourname Foo                     ,cfclientid cfclientid                 ,                 success displaySearchResults               ltscriptgt ltscriptgt     function displaySearchResultsres         searchResults.html res       ltscriptgt ltdiv idsearchResultsgtltdivgt codepre  ptest.cfcp  precodecomponent     remote any function sayHello  string yourname  anonymous          returnformatJSON verifyclienttrue         return Hello  amp arguments.yourname       codepre

The features I want to implement are realtime chatting and messaging to a specific user or group of users, file transfer and voicechat.p  pI have implemented the server and the client module using which the client can login on the server. I have used codeDataInputStreamcode and codeDataOutputStreamcode for this. When user submits username and password, I store them in a single string separated by a semicolon  and then I send this string to server using codeDataInputStreamcode where I separate them and run a DB query and send appropriate acknowledgement to the client application.p  pNow I want to implement chatting and messaging. My question is, shall I use the same approach for this Or is there a better solution Also, how can I send the message to specific clients client A wants to send message only to client B.

Negative 2218 pNewcomer to Django, so forgive me if Im missing something obvious or doing something stupid here...p  pI have a Django model with a custom save extension. Trimming the unrelated fields and methods, it looks like thisp  precodeclass Contentmodels.Model     url  models.URLFieldmaxlength1000        image  models.URLFieldblankTrue, maxlength1000     imagetype  models.NullBooleanFielddefaultNone      def saveself, args, kwargs         if self.url             img, imgtype  imageextractorself.url             print extractor returned , imgtype             print before set , self.imagetype             setattrself, image, img                setattrself, imagetype, imgtype             print after set , self.imagetype          superContent, self.saveargs, kwargs         print from query , Content.objects.geturlself.url.imagetype codepre  pThe imageextractor function returns a url string and a boolean value representing the image type True for images larger than a certain width, False for smaller images, or None if no suitable image was found. The problem is, when I query Content.objects and check imagetype, all objects return either True or None. Hence the print statements. The images with imagetype None or True work as expected, but when imagetype is returned False, this is what printsp  precodeextractor returned  False before set  None after set  False from query  True codepre  pSomehow the call to super.save always reverts imagetype to True if I try to set False but not if I set None. I admit, I dont understand super very well, but based on the documentation it seems to be necessary when extending the model function. Can anyone explain whats going on here, and how I can fix itp  pEdit I notice that I can change the value to False through the admin page and it stays False. But I still need to fix the save method. For now, I have just replaced the boolean field with an integer field and saved values as 0 or 1, which does work. But Id still like to know why the more appropriate field doesnt.p

A DLL that never had any trouble being loaded in with an explicitly written file paths is now unable to be loaded, yet the paths are the same as before.

Negative 2218 pI have ros, rosjava, and androidcore on my Ubuntu machine, as well as Eclipse and the Android SDK and ADT. Now, Im trying to create an android application using the following instructions but Im having trouble a hrefhttpdocs.rosjava.googlecode.comhgandroidcorehtmlgettingstarted.htmlgettingstarted relnofollowhttpdocs.rosjava.googlecode.comhgandroidcorehtmlgettingstarted.htmlgettingstartedap  pAfter copying the androidtutorialpubsub into another folder and trying to open it with Eclipse I get a bunch of unrecognized packages. Eclipse doesnt know where to find ros classes such as RosActivity and Im not sure how to import them. I tried importing the androidcore as per a hrefhttpros.orgwikiandroidcoreEclipseconfiguration relnofollowhttpros.orgwikiandroidcoreEclipseconfigurationa and that creates another project called MasterChooser that I can then link to the pubsub tutorial to fix some of the referencing errors, but the projects pubsub and MasterChooser still dont recognize certain files that are in rosjava. For this I tried FileImportGeneralFile System and then manually select the rosjava packages but that still leaves some issues.p  pOverall I feel there must be a simpler way to make the android app pubsub reference both androidcore and rosjava, but my lack of experience in ros and in eclipse are making this hard. In short, I really just want to be able to run the tutorial apps like pubsub from Eclipse into my android device.p

Negative 2218 pAlright, heres the scenario A team of developers wants to ensure all new code matches the defined coding standards and all the unit tests are passing before a commit is accepted. Heres the trick, all of the tests need to run on a dedicated testing machine and we do not have access to modify the git server so this must be done using a local commit hook on each dev machine.p  pWhile the specs are pretty strict were not switching to windows or subversion, for example this is a real world problem so there is some flexibility if you have a solution that almost fits.p  ul liWere using Git and nix. li liThe updated code needs to be sent to another server to run the test suite.li liA list of modified files needs to be provided to ensure they match the coding standard.li liIts a rather large codebase, so we should send the smallest amount of information necessary to ensure identical copies of the codebase.li liIf the tests fail a message needs to be displayed with the error and the commit should be blocked.li liAssume we trust our dev team and its okay to allow the tests to be bypassed with codenoverifycode option.li ul  pstrongThe questionstrong What is the best way to get the test server to sync up with the local environment to run the tests Some sort of hashtohash matching with a git patch for the new commit Skip Git altogether and just do an rsync Something else altogetherp  pstrongUpdate 8713strong I shot myself in the foot by even mentioning the remote repo. The point isnt to block the code from being pushed to the shared  remote repo, its to prevent the local commit from even happening. Whether or not this would be considered a best practice is not really the point in this case, as this is specific to a small team of developers who all want this exact functionality. The question is about the best way to achieve the goal.p

Negative 2218 pThe blog article ema hrefhttpwww.hpc.dtu.dkpageid1180 relnofollowLDLIBRARYPATH  or How to get yourself into troubleaem by the DTU Computing Center statesp  blockquote   p3. Inconsistency This is the most common problem. strongcodeLDLIBRARYPATHcode forces an application to load a shared library it wasnt linked againststrong, and that is quite likely not compatible with the original version.  This can either be very obvious, i.e. the application crashes, or it can lead to wrong results, if the picked up library not quite does what the original version would have done.  Especially the latter is sometimes hard to debug.p blockquote  pIs this emreallyem true codeLDLIBRARYPATHcode allows us to modify the search path for dynamic libraries, but does it emreallyem suppress the emsonameem lookup that ensures binary compatibilityp  pBecause, by my interpretation, the a hrefhttptldp.orgHOWTOProgramLibraryHOWTOsharedlibraries.html relnofollowProgram Library HOWTOa doesnt say any such thing.p  pOr is the author unaware of the concept of maintaining a consistent library versioning scheme, and therefore assuming that one is not in use for the library in questionp

Negative 2218 pIm using a jQuery plugin called FullCalendar to make a calendar app. I made a tab to the left of the calendar that has tabs on it for each of the 6 weeks displayed on the calendar. So, for example, if you put your mouse over the Week 1 tab it displays the agenda view of the first week of that month. I wanted to make it so that when your mouse went over the tab it displayed the week and when your mouse left the tab it went back to the normal month view. I got that part to work but I also want it so that when you actually click on the tab it stays on that view and doesnt switch back to the month view.p  pHeres the mouseover and mouseout part that works correctlyp  precodeltscriptgt  week2 .mouseoverfunction      week2.csscolor, white     week2.week2       week2 .mouseoutfunction          week2.weekout         week2.csscolor, yellow      ltscriptgt codepre  pAnd just to reiterate, all that does is when the user puts their mouse over the week2 tab it shows the week view of Week 2.

It consists of frames and some excelfiles extraction, but the problem is that this  project is extremly brokenoutdated and I have to change some functionalities and add some new feature.p  pThere are some libraries that are supported only after .NET framework 3.0 that I need to use in the new features,and the framework that the current project was built on is 2.0 or less,so changing the framework raised some thread safety problems.p  pBetween two partial classes for example which are the design file code and the backend code trying to change one labels value raises an error saying that I can not edit something that is being used at the moment... I used delegates for one of the labels, and it worked fine..then the other textbox raised another error..

Negative 2218 pI would like to have some images fade in on a web page as the page loads, so starting with opacity0 then fade to opacity1 using an imageloading script.p  pHowever, for the script to work, the images have to initially be invisible. So if I set the opacity to zero using CSS, if a user does not have javaScript, they will not see any of the images.p  pTo combat this, I have tried applying the zero opacity via jQuery like this...p  precode .images.cssopacity, 0 codepre  p...however I still get a flicker of the images at 100 opacity, and then the jQuery kicks in, hiding them, only for them to fade in again with the imageloading script.p  pSo what is the safest way to hide the images initially before they are loaded, so that even if the user has javaScript disabled, they will still be able to see the images, they just wont get the fancy image loading effectp  pThanks in advancep

Negative 2218 pIve been trying to animate circle drawing using CALayer. It all works well, but the problem is  drawn circle is not antialiased enough. It has a bit too rough borders, or blurred if rasterize is used. AntiAliasing is enabledp  pTried alsop  blockquote   pedgeAntialiasingMask  kCALayerLeftEdge  kCALayerRightEdge    kCALayerBottomEdge  kCALayerTopEdgep blockquote  pto no avail.p  pHere is an example how it looks like without rasterization img srchttpi.stack.imgur.com5oTPk.png altenter image description herep  pAnd here is an example with rasterization tried values from 1.0 till 4.0 just to be sure. Result  the same.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comp5P5g.png altenter image description herep  pAnd here is the same circle, but drawn inside UIView drawrectp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com4aA0L.png altenter image description herep  pYou can see, that circle drawn using UIView drawrect is looking much better.p  pThe reason I cannot use UIView is because I need to animate circle filling. Using CALayer it is really easy, but to do the same on UIView, I dont really know if it is even possible. I could try to launch drawrect every 160 seconds, but I think it will get laggy, as it is not intended that way.p  pstrongSo  does anyone have any solution how I could make drawn circleslines on CALayer look the same as drawn on UIViewstrong p

Negative 2218 pIm really struggling to set up a periodic task using Celery Beat on Windows 7 unfortunately that is what Im dealing with at the moment. The app that will be using celery is written with CherryPy, so the Django libraries are not relevant here. All Im looking for is a simple example of how to start the Celery Beat Process in the background. The FAQ section says the following, but I havent been able to actually do it yetp  pWindowsp  pThe B  beat option to worker doesnt workp  pAnswer Thats right. Run celery beat and celery worker as separate services instead.p  pMy project layout is as followsp  precodeproj     init.py empty     celery.py     celeryschedule.py     celerysettings.py these work     tasks.py codepre  pcelery.pyp  precodefrom future import absoluteimport  from celery import Celery from proj import celerysettings from proj import celeryschedule  app  Celery     proj,     brokercelerysettings.BROKERURL,     backendcelerysettings.CELERYRESULTBACKEND,     include[proj.tasks]    Optional configuration, see the application user guide. app.conf.update      CELERYTASKRESULTEXPIRES3600,      CELERYBEATSCHEDULEceleryschedule.CELERYBEATSCHEDULE   if name  main     app.start codepre  ptasks.pyp  precodefrom future import absoluteimport  from proj.celery import app   app.task def addx, y     return x  y codepre  pceleryschedule.pyp  precode from datetime import timedelta   CELERYBEATSCHEDULE        addevery30seconds            task tasks.add,           schedule timedeltaseconds3,           args 16, 16      ,   codepre  pRunning celery worker appproj l info from the command line from the parent directory of proj starts the worker thread just fine and I can execute the add task from the Python terminal. However, I just cant figure out how to start the beat service. Obviously the syntax is probably incorrect as well because I havent gotten past the missing beat option.p
Negative 2218 pIve been programming in WPF for a while now coming from Windows Forms.

Also my ClassDiagram is filled with the Fields of the codePublic Shared DependencyPropertycode and Properties of the codePublic Propertycode.p  pIm wondering, is there an easier or much better way to bind View and ViewModel Most of the codePropertiescode I use are to put codeTextcode in codeTextBoxescode.p

Negative 2218 pI have a recent experience Id like to share that may be helpful to anyone having to maintain a legacy ASMX web service that must be updated to call Taskbased methods.p  pIve recently been updating an ASP.NET 2.0 project that includes a legacy ASMX web service to ASP.NET 4.5.  As part of the update, I introduced a Web API interface to allow advanced automation of the application.  The ASMX service has to coexist with the new API for backwardscompatibility.p  pOne of the functions of the application is to be able to request data from external data sources industrial plant historians, bespoke web services, etc. on behalf of the caller.  As part of the upgrade, I rewrote substantial parts of the data access layer to asynchronously request data using a Taskbased asynchronous pattern.  Given that its not possible to use ayncawait in an ASMX service, I modified the ASMX methods to make blocking calls to the asynchronous methods i.e. calling the Taskbased method and then using Task.WaitAll to block the thread until the Task completes.  p  pWhen calling any ASMX method that was calling a method returning Task or TaskltTgt under the hood, I found that the request always timed out.  When I stepped through the code, I could see that that the asynchronous code was successfully executing, but the call to Task.WaitAll never detected that the task had completed.p  pThis caused a major headache how could the ASMX service happily coexist with the new asynchronous data access capabilitiesp

But from what I understood from the method signature is that I should also be able to use method 2 like the followingp  precodeSitecoreIndexableItem folderID  SitecoreIndexableItemcontextDatabase.GetItemFOLDERGUID var index  ContentSearchManager.GetIndexnew SitecoreIndexableItemSitecore.Context.Item using var context  index.CreateSearchContext      ListltSearchStringModelgt searchStringModel  new ListltSearchStringModelgt     searchStringModel.Addnew SearchStringModelmyfieldname, blabla     ListltSitecore.Data.Items.Itemgt resultItems  LinqHelper.CreateQuerycontext, searchStringModel, folderID.SelecttoItem gt toItem.GetItem.ToList                  codepre  pProblem is for the above method method 2 the searching works fine, what doesnt work is the startLocationItem folderID in this case. p  pFOR EXAMPLE,br strongIFstrong in my entire sitecore tree has total 3 items containing myfilednameblabla br strongBUT,strong only 1 item contains myfilednameblabla in the Folder FOLDERGUID, the perticular folder in this case br strongTHEN,strongbr Method 1 returns 1 item WHICH IS CORRECT BUT, Method 2 returns 3 items, despite startLocationItem  FOLDERGUID ...

Negative 2218 pI just started using a hrefhttpwww.heidisql.com relnofollowHeidiSQLa to manage my databases at work. I was previously using NaviCat, and I was able to simply drag and drop a database from one server to a database on another server and copy all the tables and datapiece of cake, backed up. Similar functionality isnt obvious in Heidi, but I decided using mysqldump is a standard way of backing up a database and I should get to know it.p  pI used Heidi to perform the dumpcreating databases, creating tables, inserting data, and making one single SQL file. This was performed on one single database that is 801.7 MB checksum 1755734665. When I executed the dump file on my local doppelganger database it appeared to work flawlessly, however the database size is 794.0 MB checksum 2937674450.p  pSo, by creating a new database from a mysqldump of a database I lost 7.7 MB of something and the databases have different checksumsnot sure what that means though. I searched and found a post saying that performing a mysqldump can optimize a database, but could not find any conclusive information.p  pAm I being a helicopter parent Is there any easy way to make sure I didnt lose datastructure somehowp  pThank you, Kaip

Negative 2218 pIm new with Javascript, and Im developing a webapp. Im using quojs, a library for tactil gestures, but my problem, I think, comes from my inexperience with Javascript. The app y basically, an images gallery that generates dinamically, and lets you interact with each image. On taphold, an interactive menu merges inside the image. On singleTap it should make 2 different actions depending if we are already in taphold state or not. If case is we ARE IN TAPHOLD, it showld ONLY desapear the interactive menu inside the image. Then, on the next singleTap now WITHOUT TAPHOLD STATE, it showld go inside the image. For this, im actually using AJAX. The taphold function is working fine, but the problem is that the tap action, keeps firing no matter what I try to put inside the code to administrate when it must trigger or not.p  pI know its a bit difficult to explain and understand, but I couldnt find the solution yet...

Negative 2218 pI work on a team with a large Java code base 300k lines of code, which recently adopted Git as the source control migrated from ClearCase.  We are using a hrefhttpnvie.compostsasuccessfulgitbranchingmodel relnofollowGit Flowa as our branching strategy.  There are a couple of use cases that we come across fairly frequently which we have been struggling with.p  ol lipWe have merged all of our features into the develop branch to be used in an upcoming release.  When we get close to the release, it turns out one feature cannot go live either due to the client not being ready, or some other reason.  Whats the best way to create the release branch, but leave out a specific feature across many commits The feature needs to be available to be included in the next future release.  What we have tried before is to do a git revert on all the commits, create the release branch, then do a git revert on the reverted commits.  This is a pretty painful approach, particularly for large features.pli lipWe have already created the release branch, but before the release goes live, its determined a feature needs to be removed.  Similar to the first use case, this feature needs to be able to go into a following release.  Because of this, just doing a git revert on the commits doesnt solve it completely, as the reverts will get backmerged into the develop branch when we do a git flow release finish.pli ol  pAs outlined in the Git Flow model, all commits are made on feature branches, and never directly on the develop branch. When a feature is complete and ready for the next release, it is then merged to develop. When its time for the next release, the release branch is created off of develop.  After the release has been regression tested and fixed if necessary, it goes to production and is merged to master, and back to develop in case of bug fixes, and tagged with a version number.  The problems above come when a feature which we thought is going in the next release ends up needing to be left out.  p  pWhat are the best methods to handle these situations  In both of these scenarios, the branches have been published and pulled down by many developers, so messing with the history can create difficulties.  I know that these are less than ideal, but unfortunately the situations are out of our control.p

Negative 2218 pstrongBriefstrongp  pI am relatively new to Django but have been working with Python for some time. What I am attempting to do seems to be a little complicated to explain, but I will try my best to describe my Django configuration and what steps Ive taken in an attempt to attain the desired behavior or results.p  pI have searched Google for some examples on how to validate fields upon submission from the admin user interface. At this point the closest thing I have seen my admin UI do is if a required field is left empty, then when the entry is saved the admin interface produces an error requiring me to put some data in the field before it can continue. However unlike a regular view if I enter alpha numeric data in a numeric only field and click save, the admin seems to be successful and states the entry was updated when clearly it was not..p  pIm not sure why the admin would do this seemingly by default but I have tried a few things that were suggested during Google searches.p  psome people recommended setting the form variable in admin.py.

Negative 2218 pI inherited a messaging app that allows users to not only send messages, but also send pictures, videos, and file as attachments. These attachments, when received, are saved to the users SD card.p  pFrom within the app, if the users click on the received attachment, that attachment should be opened appropriately in a corresponding application. For example, pictures are opened in the gallery, pdfs are opened in a PDFveiwer, and videos should be opened and played in the users default video player.p  pMy problem is that currently, when a user receives a video file of the .ts format, my app does not recognize it as a video file, but instead as a text file. This prevents the user from being able to click on the attachment from within my messaging app to view the video, a core feature of my app.p  pHow could I enact this functionality Thank you, and please let me know if theres any code I should include from my app that would help.p
Negative 2218 pGiven a classp  precodepublic class MovementType     Public Sub Move         Move around     End Sub End class codepre  pand an interfacep  precodepublic Interface IMovingObject     Property mType As MovementType     Sub Move End Interface codepre  pI would like to have several implementations of this Interface for different subclasses of MovementType. For example I would like to have an implementation of IMovingObject for each of the following subclasses where i set mType to an instance of these classes. p  precodepublic class Swimming     Inherits MovementType      public Sub dive         breathe         dive     End Sub End class codepre  por p  precodepublic class Flying     Inherits MovementType      public Sub land         catch CanNotLandOnLavaException     End Sub End class codepre  pThus i would like to create something like thisp  precodepublic class FlyingObject     Implements IMovingObject      Property mType As Flying     public Sub Move         mType.Move     End Sub End class codepre  pThe reason why I want a setup like this is that i want to be able to manage FlyingObjects and SwimmingObjects with the same interface to move them around. However in some cases i need to call specific Methods like mType.dive for a SwimmingObject when i have a concrete implementation of IMovingObject. Thus it is mandatory for mType being Swimming for a SwimmingObject instead of being a generic MovementType.p  pThe problem which i am encountering in my example is of course that FlyingObject does not implement IMovingObject because mType does not have the Type MovementType which is specified in the Interface.p  pA possible solution would be setting mType to an instance of Flyingp  precodepublic class FlyingObject     Implements IMovingObject      Property mType As MovementType      Public Sub New         mType  New Flying     End Sub      public Sub Move         mType.Move     End Sub End class codepre  pThen i could call the land method from anywhere by using p  precodeCtypemtype,Flying.land codepre  pUsing direct casts all over the place does not seem like a viable solution though. What would be the correct way to implement this p  pPlease note that the above code is just an example and ignore unusual naming conventions and the fact that it does not make sense to give a type the ability to dive or land. I just wanted to give you some code to work with here p

Negative 2218 pIm relatively new in the XCodeiOS world Ive done some decent sized storyboard based apps, but I didnt ever cut me teeth on the whole nibxib thing. I want to use the same tools for scenes to designlayout a reusable viewcontrol. So I created my first ever xib for my view subclass and painted it upp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comUYZHQ.png altenter image description herep  pI have my outlets connected and constraints setup, just like Im used to doing in the storyboard. I set the class of my codeFile Ownercode to that of my custom codeUIViewcode subclass. So I assume I can instantiate this view subclass with some API, and it will configuredconnected as shown.p  pNow back in my storyboard, I want to embedreuse this. Im doing so in a table view prototype cellp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comZJpF0.png altenter image description herep  pIve got a view. Ive set the class of it to my subclass.

I know the my generator is still running, and a pipeless codeinotifywait m e close tmpinocode in another terminal is still producing output.p  pAfter a bit of thinking, I assumed it was probably a buffering problem issues like this often seem to be. I changed my pipeline to p  precodeinotifywait m e close tmpino 2gtdevnull  grep v ISDIR linebuffered  grep v ISDIR codepre  pAnd now Im getting output again, so that fixes the problem.p  pHowever, I dont really understand why it failed to work without forcing line buffering. Ive never experienced issues like this with grep, even with slow producing outputs. However, some other programs in the pipeline, forcing codesedcode to be codesed ucode , and forcing me to add codefflushcode in at the end of each codeawkcode statement.p  pSo, whats forcing strange buffering here, and how can I fix it without having to scrabble around in man pages looking for esoteric force line buffering commandsp

Negative 2218 pBasically, Im trying to figure out how PIN tracks Image loads using IMGAddInstrumentFunction. The documentation says Use this to register a call back to catch the loading of an image. There is an codeimageloadcode pintool in sourcetoolsManualExamples that uses this.p  pa hrefhttpsstackoverflow.comquestions26876247howdoesexecvecalldynamiclinkerloaderldlinuxso2From what I understanda an ELF binary that is executedexecved is mmaped into memory by the kernel. If the executable has a PTINTERP segmentpointing to something like ldlinux.so.2, it mmaps that files segments into memory and passes control to it.p  pWhat Im trying to figure out is  What behaviour causes PIN to recognise an image loadp  pInitially I thought it would be a set of openfstatmmap2close system calls that would indicate an image load. PIN also shows that the initial executable image in the load, but as it cannot intercept mmap calls made from execve to kernel space, so I imagined that PIN would be monitoring execves also.p  pHowever, when I tried using PIN with a UPX compressed binary on Linuxwhich ends up becoming stripped and statically linked, I could find no image loads at allnot even of the main executable image.p  pWhy does this happenp

Negative 2218 pI need help to find out how to deal with following scenariop  pDuring Django web app startup, a watchdog observer thread is being run in background also. If watchdog detects new file in a folder, it moves the file into another location. p  pWhile it works well with Django runserver noreload, it breaks, when I run with runserver in autoreload mode. I think the same issue will occur if I run it with e.g. uwsgi with multiple workers. p  pWhy it breaks Because each process gets notification about the new file and if first of them moves that file to another location, second one breaks with p  precodeOSError [Errno 2] No such file or directory  codepre  pThe error is related to the file which is supposed to be moved, but its not there, because the file has been moved already.p  pFirst question is does autoreload mode of runserver is similar to uwsgi with 2 workersp  pSecond how to deal with itp  pI know I experienced similar challenges in the past related to different use case without watchdog involved and with uwsgi and wonder if you guys can help me to learn how to deal with such scenarios.

Negative 2218 pstrongContextstrongp  pWe have 6 instances of Cassandra hosted on AWS, separated into 3 different regions, 2 per regions 2 in euwest, 2 in uswest, 2 in apsoutheast.p  p2 days ago, we moved 2 of our EC2 Cassandra instances from uswest1 to useast1. When I say move I mean that we decommissioned them and added 2 new instances on our cluster.p  pWe ran codenodetool repaircode which didnt do anything, and codenodetool rebuildcode which synchronized our data from the euwest data centre. Following that change we noticed that multiple instances on our Cassandra cluster were using over 70 CPU and had incoming traffic.p  pAt first, we thought it was the replication taking place, but considering that we only had 500MB of data, and that it is still running we are puzzled as to what is happening.p  hr  pstrongInstances hardwarestrongp  pAll of our instances are running on m3.medium which means that we are onp  ul li1 CPU, 2.5 GHzli li3.75 GB of RAMli li4GB SSDli ul  pAlso we have mounted an EBS volume for codevarlibcassandracode which is actually a RAID0 of 6 SSDs on EBSp  ul liEBS volume 300GB SSD, RAID0li ul  pRef a hrefhttpaws.amazon.comec2instancetypes relnofollowAmazon Instances Typesap  hr  pstrongSoftware Versionstrongp  pCassandra Version 2.0.12p  hr  pstrongThoughtsstrongp  pAfter analysing our data we thought this was caused by Cassandra data compaction.p  pThere is another stackoverflow question around the same subject a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions28236638cassandracompactiontasksstuckCassandra compaction tasks stucka.p  pHowever, this was solved by going for a single SSD Azure Premium Storage  still in preview and no RAID0 configured for Cassandra, and as the author said, there is no reason for this to fix the underlying problem why would removing the RAID0 part from the equation fix this.p  pWe are not keen yet to move to a local storage as AWS pricing is a lot higher than what we have now. Even though, if it really is the cause of our problem, we will try it.p  pAnother reason why this sounds like a deeper problem is that we have data showing that these EBS volumes have been writingreading a lot of data in the last 3 days.p  pSince we moved instances, we get something around 300400KB of written data per second on each EBS volume, so since we have a RAID0, 6 times this amount per second  1.82.4MBs. This amounts to 450GB of data written PER instance over the last 3 days. And we have basically the same value for READ operation too.p  pWe are only running tests on them at the moment, so the only traffic we are getting is coming from our CI server and eventually from the communication that Gossip is doing between the instances.p  hr  pstrongDebug notesstrongp  pOutput of codenodetool statuscodep  precodeDatacenter cassandraeuwest1A  StatusUpDown  StateNormalLeavingJoiningMoving   Address         Load       Tokens  Owns   Host ID                               Rack UN  xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx 539.5 MB   256     17.3  1234123412341234123412341234123412340cd7  euwest1c UN  xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx 539.8 MB   256     14.4  30ff8d001ab645389c67a49e9ad34672  euwest1b Datacenter cassandraapsoutheast1A  StatusUpDown  StateNormalLeavingJoiningMoving   Address         Load       Tokens  Owns   Host ID                               Rack UN  xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx 585.13 MB  256     16.9  a0c45f3f84794046b3c0b2dd19f07b87  apsoutheast1a UN  xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx 588.66 MB  256     17.8  b91c5863e1e14cb6b9c10f24a33b4baf  apsoutheast1b Datacenter cassandrauseast1A  StatusUpDown  StateNormalLeavingJoiningMoving   Address         Load       Tokens  Owns   Host ID                               Rack UN  xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx 545.56 MB  256     15.2  ab049390f5a149a9bb58b8402b0d99af  useast1d UN  xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx 545.53 MB  256     18.3  39c698ea27934aa0a28dc286969febc4  useast1e codepre  pOutput of codenodetool compactionstatscodep  precodepending tasks 64           compaction type        keyspace           table       completed           total      unit  progress                Compaction         staging    statshourly       418858165      1295820033     bytes    32.32 Active compaction remaining time    0h00m52s codepre  pRunning codedstatcode on unhealthy instancep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comgtfcF.png altdstat on unhealthy instancep  pCompaction history in graph form average of 300 times per hour starting the 16thp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comYdEOV.png altCompaction history graphp  pEBS Volumes usagep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com6wuH6.png altEBS Volume 1p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comxTyJ1.png altEBS Volume 2p  pRunning df hp  precodeFilesystem      Size  Used Avail Use Mounted on devxvda1       33G   11G   21G  34  none            4.0K     0  4.0K   0 sysfscgroup udev            1.9G   12K  1.9G   1 dev tmpfs           377M  424K  377M   1 run none            5.0M     0  5.0M   0 runlock none            1.9G  4.0K  1.9G   1 runshm none            100M     0  100M   0 runuser devxvdb       3.9G  8.1M  3.7G   1 mnt devmd0        300G  2.5G  298G   1 varlibcassandra codepre  pRunning codenodetool tpstatscodep  precodePool Name                    Active   Pending      Completed   Blocked  All time blocked MutationStage                     0         0        3191689         0                 0 ReadStage                         0         0         574633         0                 0 RequestResponseStage              0         0        2698972         0                 0 ReadRepairStage                   0         0           2721         0                 0 ReplicateOnWriteStage             0         0              0         0                 0 MiscStage                         0         0          62601         0                 0 HintedHandoff                     0         1            443         0                 0 FlushWriter                       0         0          88811         0                 0 MemoryMeter                       0         0           1472         0                 0 GossipStage                       0         0         979483         0                 0 CacheCleanupExecutor              0         0              0         0                 0 InternalResponseStage             0         0             25         0                 0 CompactionExecutor                1        39          99881         0                 0 ValidationExecutor                0         0          62599         0                 0 MigrationStage                    0         0             40         0                 0 commitlogarchiver                0         0              0         0                 0 AntiEntropyStage                  0         0         149095         0                 0 PendingRangeCalculator            0         0             23         0                 0 MemtablePostFlusher               0         0         173847         0                 0  Message type           Dropped READ                         0 RANGESLICE                  0 TRACE                       0 MUTATION                     0 COUNTERMUTATION             0 BINARY                       0 REQUESTRESPONSE             0 PAGEDRANGE                  0 READREPAIR                  0 codepre  pRunning iptraf, sorted by bytesp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comUsDN2.png altiptraf sorted by bytesp

Negative 2218 pI have several proxy servers and I want to be able to elect the least busy of them based on their current bandwidth. My idea is that each proxy server will have some kind of monitoring service that will push current bandwidth of server to some distributed datastore that will form a cluster so each node in the cluster will have all data.p  pOn the other side  there will be some kind of service one or several instances that will join the cluster as well, but in read only mode and it will elect the least busy server based on data reported by all proxy server monitoring services.p  pMy question  is etcd or Consul.io an appropriate solution for this task Or there is some better datastore I prefer AP or CP systems in CAP theorem, Im fine with just keyvalue store.p

Negative 2218 pThis is my first post, so please excuse me for any obvious or simple questions as I am very new to programming and all my projects are a first to me.  I am currently working on my first database project. A relational database using Oracle sql. Im new on my course, so I am not sure on all the concepts yet, but working at it. I have used some modelling software to help me construct a 13 table database. I have setup all my columns and assigned primary and foreign keys to all 13 tables. What I am looking to do now is insert 10 rows of test data into each table. I have done the parent tables but am confused about the child tables. When I assign ID numbers to all the parent tables primary keys, will the child tables foreign keys be populated at the same time I have not used sequences yet as Im not 100 how to make them work, but instead inputted my own values like 100, 101, 102 etc. I know those values need to be in the foreign key, but wouldnt manually inserting them into many tables get confusing Is there an easier approach to this or am I over complicating the process I will need to use some queries later but I just want to be happy that the data is sound. Thanks for your help Robp

Negative 2218 pI am PHP programmer and Im starting with Swift and objectoriented programming and come. I intend to develop an application based on tables with a SQLite database, something simple, but Im sure in which to properly desenolver it.p  pAhead of the site schedule, I figured it would be basically the same way to program, that is, on the first page I search the database the information that I will use on that page eg product name and when the user clicks this product, the link would take you to another page and there again I would connect me with the database and through the ID passed to this new page, Id get all product information in question eg. product image, product details, value, etc.p  pSo, I figured that the same would happen with my application, ie I only spend the ID of a ViewContoller to another, and both View I would connect me with the database and would take the information that I would use for each View. Seeing some tutorials, I realized that were made differently. On the first view, all information is captured and linked as properties of an object. And in this case rather than sending the ID, the View would send the entire object to another View.p  pMy question is what the correct way to program if I have a lot of information to present. In my case here, I have more than 3,600 products and this product has over 8 properties long texts each.p

Negative 2218 pI write a library, this library includes a function codevoid fcode this function is a one line function and when I compile the library to shared object with O3 gcc optimization flag it is inlined.

Is there a way for my code to use the function inlined but still instantiate it in the object file so library users will be able to link and use it When I say instantiate it in the object file I mean Id like to see it when I run codeobjdump tcode on the shared object.

My question is, is there a way for me to just have a text file hosted somewhere so that I do not have to setup a server for this I know usually a database would be most beneficial for a high traffic situation but for right now the high scores will literally only keep track of 3 scores at a time. 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place. p  pI have looked into the textupload.com api and the pastebin.com api and I am not really sure they will do what I am hoping while also not allowing users to not edit things themselves.p  pI just want to host this file on the internet somewhere so my app can read from it to compare the local players scores to the high scores and then append the file if score changes must be made. p
Negative 2218 pI want to know strongifstrong and stronghowstrong it is possible to use an other clientside validation framework than jquery validate, eg. Parsley in asp.net mvcp  pI just looked into the mvc sourcecode and it seems to be hardwired.

It seems that asp.net mvc have too many static classes e.g. HtmlHelper which makes it nearly impossible to extend some functionality without rewriting a lot of frameworkcodep  pThe power of common data annotations is cool to descibe meta information about the data. Its used by Entity Framework and MVC, but the clientside validation should be limited to jquery validatep  pI know, that I can configure clientvalidation frameworks like parsley to get used with an other prefix like the dataval of jquery validate instead of dataparsley, but not all features can be used this way and conflicts are possible.p  pHope anyone have an answer for me p

Negative 2218 pI am developing a HTML5 game, using Phaser and the Google Closure Compiler in advanced mode in order to package the game.p  pIve ran into an issue where it seems I am unable to destroy a sprite.

Its not because its unreachable code, if I put codeconsole.logcode statements in the same scope they stay there.p  pSo the original code is thisp  precodeif typeof this.sprite  undefined     console.logdestroy sprite     this.sprite.destroy     Phaser.Component.Destroy.prototype.destroy.callthis.sprite     console.logsprite destroyed  codepre  pAnd it gets compiled to thisp  precodeundefinedtypeof this.spriteampampconsole.logdestroy sprite,console.logsprite destroyed codepre  pI cant figure out why the code is removed, Phaser is set as an external and Im not running into this issue with any other methods or phaser classes.p  pSimply calling codeevalthis.sprite.destroycode works by the way. This proves that the function does actually exist. However this is a pretty shitty solution, and only works because the compiler isnt replacing codespritecode in this case.p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pIve been able to reliably reproduce the issue with very little code, see my answer below. But I dont know why this is happening yet.p  pstrongUPDATE 2strongp  pThanks to Hacketo we figured out that this issue occurs because a proper Phaser extern file is missing.

Negative 2218 pWe know that ListView has a codeHeadercode property that can allow you custom its header that can be scrolled out of the ScrollViewer area. p  pHowever, if there is acodeListViewcode in each codePivotItemcodelets assume that there are 2 PivotItem of a codePivotcode, and they share a codeHeadercode which can be also scrolled out of the ScrollViewer area.p  pThe layout in the case can be described in XAML likep  precodeltScrollViewergt    ltStackPanelgt      ltGrid xNameSharedHeader Height200gt        ltTextBlock TextI am a headergt      ltGridgt      ltPivotgt        ltPivotItemgt           ltListView MaxHeight1000gt        ltPivotItemgt        ltPivotItemgt           ltListView MaxHeight1000gt        ltPivotItemgt      ltPivotgt    ltStackPanelgt ltScrollViewergt codepre  pNote that codeListViewcode above supports codeIncrementalLoadingcode so that I limit their codeMaxHeightcode in case they load all the items.p  pAnd I come up with an idea p  blockquote   pat first, I disable VerticalScrollMode ListViews inner ScrollViewer.
