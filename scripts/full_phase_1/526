Positive 526 pThis is a bit of a potentially multipart part question. My goal is to either be able to reset UI changes that users make, limit changes that users can make, in order to have a consistent environment in a multisession lab situation.p  pI have played with some registry settings that allow me to set background which I want to be a solid color and such, but the changes dont get applied till after a restart. Thus far I have found do way to Refresh the UI. And, ideally I could do this without a restart. In addition, if someone where to set a Theme, then my simple registry hacks are overridden and even after a restart they dont make a difference, so I would like to just disable the ability to set Themes. Now, I found a hrefhttpwww.askvg.comallkindsofrestrictionsforwindows2000xp2003andvista relnofollowthisa, but its all pre Vista references, and I am unable to make changes to the Policy key in HKCU. So, my questions are 1 Is there a way to limit certain changes to the UI programmatically And... 2 Is there a way to Refresh programmatically after resetting those changes I do allowp  pFor what it is worth, I am testing this with Windows 7 Home, but I would like to find a solution that would work in Windows 7 Pro up to various versions of Windows 10.p  pAny help is greatly appreciated.p

Positive 526 pI am attempting to bootstrap some powershell scrips in Chef via powershellscript resources in my Chef Cookbook.  When I run locally using ChefClient everything works as expected.  Then I trigger this same cookbook via OpsWorks against a new EC2 instance and the cookbook runs successfully, with the powershell returning a 0 return code, but none of the powershell code is actually executed.  When I create an RDP session and run this same script manually on the new EC2 instance everything again runs as expected.  There are no logs providing details on the skipped execution and no errors in the Chef run logs or in the Windows Event Log.  Can anyone point me in a direction to trouble shoot or solve this issuep

Negative 526 pI was just wondering if anyone else just sees integration tests as just a special unit test.  I have, however, heard from other programmers that it is a good idea to separate your unit tests and integration test.  I was wondering if someone could explain why this is a good idea.  What sorts of advantages would there be to treating integration and unit tests as completely different  For example, I have seen separate folders and packages for integration tests and unit tests.  I would be of the opinion that a single test package containing both unit tests and integration tests would be sufficient as they both are basically the same concept.p
Negative 526 pThere are essentially 2 places to define JavaScript functions in Grails, directly in a  element on the GSP, and within a separate javascript source file under webappjs for example, application.js. We have defined a commonly reused javascript function within application.js, but we also need to be able to generate parts of the function dynamically using groovy code. Unfortunately, some groovy code does not appear to be processed within separate javascript source files.p  pIs the only way to do this by defining the javascript function within a script tag on a GSP page, or is there a more general solution Obviously we could define the javascript function in a script tag within a template GSP file which would be reused, but there is a lot of push to keep our javascript functions defined all together in one place i.e. the external javascript source file. This has performance benefits as well the javascript source files are usually just downloaded once by each clients browser, instead of reloading the same javascript functions within the source of every html page they visit. I have toyed around with the idea of breaking the function up into static and dynamic pieces, putting the static ones in the external source and putting the dynamic ones in the template GSP, then gluing them together, but this seems like an unnecessary hack.p  pAny ideasp  pedit It may sound like the idea of dynamically generating parts of a JavaScript function, which is then downloaded once and used over and over again by the client, would be a bad idea. However, the piece which is dynamic only changes perhaps once a week or month, and then only very slightly. Mostly we just want this piece generated off the database, even if only once, instead of hard coded.p
Negative 526 pI use Stylecop for Resharper and whenever I call something in my class, Stylecop tells me to use the strongthisstrong keyword. But the IDE says this is redundant code which it sure is, so why should I use the strongthisstrong keywordp  pDoes redundant code mean its not needed obviously and the compiler wont even do anything with the this keyword So I assume the this keyword is just for clarity.p  pAlso, with the CLR, do things like this fall consistently across languages So if the answer is that the compiler doesnt even touch the strongthisstrong keyword and it is just for presentation and clarity, then the same is true for VB.NET I assume it is all for clarity as stylecop keeps an eye on this and Fxcop which I will use later on keeps an eye on my codes quality from a technical point of view.p  pThanksp

Negative 526 pIve written a clientserver model in C using .Net remoting. If I have the client connected to the server, then kill the server and restart it without trying to call any server methods from the client whilst the server is down, I can reconnect happily.p  pIf I close the server then try to ping the server from the client which I do from a separate thread to avoid an endless wait then when the server comes back online, the client can never talk to it and my Ping thread that was fired during the downtime waits forever deep in the guts of the remoting libraries. I try to Abort this if trying to Join the thread fails after a short time but it wont abort. Im wondering if this is part of the problem.p  pIf I start up another client, then that client can talk to the server just fine. I figured I needed to restart some aspect of the original client but cannot see what would need to be shut down. I certainly null the server Im connected to and call Activator.GetObject with the same address something the second client does to connect to the server, which works fine, but regetting the server doesnt help at all.p  pThe server is running a as singleton via RegisterWellKnownServiceType.p

Negative 526 pI have clientserver applications and a very simple protocol for communication. More precisely, its a set of commands a server sends and a set of requests a client can make.p  pThe idea is as followsp  pWhen a command is made by the server, a client has to execute it. When a request is made, server checks permissions and if everything is ok it grants the request.p  pThe application is written in C and I got slightly stuck designing the architecture for this sort of communication protocol. Assuming that commandrequest is a tabdelimited string with first parameter being the name of the message, I was planning to make a codeMessageManagercode class which would store all messages in a hashtable and retrieve them when necessary. The problem here is thisp  precodetypedef stdvectorlt stdstring gt ArgArray class Request  public Message  public    Request const char name   Message name    ifdef CLIENT     problem here     virtual void make ...   0 elif defined SERVER    virtual void grant const Client ampc, const ArgArray ampparams  const  0 protected    virtual void checkPermissions const Client ampc, const ArgArray ampparams  const  0 endif  codepre  pBecause different messages can take different arguments to be constructed I cant really create a complete interface. For example, some messages might need a simple string to be constructed, whereas others might need some numeric data. This complicates things and makes the design a bit untidy... I.e. I have to get round the problem by ommitting codemakecode from interface definition and simply add different codemakecode for each Request I make. Also, if I wish to store pointers to different Requests in one container I cannot use codedynamiccastcode because codeRequestcode is not a polymorphic type. An obvious untidy solution would use codemake int n, ... code definition and use codestdarg.hcode to extract different arguments but I consider this to be unsafe and confusing for the programmer.p  pThere is obviously a design flaw in my idea. I already have a solution in mind but I am just wondering, how would people at SO tackle this problem What sort of Object architecture would you use Is there a simpler approach that could solve this problem There arent any specific requirements to this except to keep it as simple as possible and to keep the actual protocol as it is tabdelimited strings with first parameter indicating which message it is.p

For example when using a textboxp  precodepdf.textbox Ipsum dolor sit amet consectetue,   width    gt pdf.bounds.width  10, height gt 150,   overflow gt ellipses codepre  pThis will generate the text box except I can not find in the docs on how to control the spacing between lines of text.  The strings I will be using are typically 5 to 8 lines long.p  pThank you in advancep

Negative 526 pA friend and I are currently working on a turnbased game with chat with both desktop browser and Android clients, with Google App Engine as the server. p  pWere using the Java API for GAE and using HTTP for communication with the server. Weve implemented simple chat functionality, and were getting undesirable latencies 13 seconds from both the browser and Android clients while just posting simple oneword chat messages.p  pMy friend thought it would be best to use XMPP instead of HTTP, but we want to use a Google Accounts cookie for authentication from the Android client, and according to the GAE documentation, XMPP clients cannot use a Google Accounts cookie and must use the users password.p  pDoes anyone have any suggestions as to where the latency might be coming from, how to troubleshoot it, andor what to do about itp  pAlso, is anyone aware of any opensource implementations of chat or something similar on GAE done in Java Cant seem to find any.p

Negative 526 pWe are adapting our client side relatively complicated application ActiveX  .net  Delphi  C  COM  to use SxS to achieve non admin deployment and isolation from older versions of our product.p  pWe were able to achieve this goal for almost all our in proc components such as our .net ui, Delphi ui, and the COM servers we use in proc by composing a manifest file which described all the libraries used by our process, with no registration on the client of any of the components almost.p  pAnd here comes the almost part At the moment, our application invokes from its c portion an out of proc ActiveX server Delphi ActiveX EXE, which in turn itself invokes another set of out of proc ActiveX servers third party plugins, any thing goes here, Delphi, C, any thing as long as its out of proc ActiveX EXE and implements our interfaces.p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1026202As we knowa SxS does not support out of proc ActiveX servers. And we cant use these objects as in proc com servers in our main process because that would require a major rewrite of our application and even worst, a break of our public facing API which is used by third party tools and vendors, an api break which we cant allow.p  pWe have stumbled on a hrefhttpsupport.microsoft.comkb249232 relnofollowthis articlea which describes how IHTMLDocument2 can be extracted from an Internet Explorer window running in a separate process. Which made us think of this approachp  pWe would create a secondary satellite application  process which will run the ActiveX as in process server. Then we will use a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarydd31855728VS.8529.aspx relnofollowLresultFromObjecta and a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarydd37360528VS.8529.aspx relnofollowObjectFromLresulta to transfer a reference of the  ActiveX object from the satellite application to the main application process. The satellite application will have its own manifest file which will allow it to run in SxS mode.p  pSame approach will be taken to communicate between this Delphi ActiveX EXE and the third party AciveX EXE Pluginsp  pThere is an alternative solution, which for the moment we do not prefer over the proposed solution above which is to use .net remoting and .net com proxy classes to open the communication channel between the two processes, by translating the com request to .net remoting, and back to com on the second process. p  pSo here comes the questionp  ol liWhat do you think about this approach li liDo you see a better solution to the problem li ol

Negative 526 pI have 2 sheets sheet1 and sheet2 in an excel 2007 file.p  pIn sheet2 I have a column that is managed by a formmacrowith a tree view control. When an element has been selected, the cell is filled with an x, when it has been unselected, the cell is filled with  nothing.p  pIn sheet1 I want to create a column equal to the sheet2 column. So for example if sheet2C24  x then sheet1c24 should also be x I also would like it to work both ways. If the user changes sheet1c24 to x, then I want sheet2c24 to take the same value.p  pProblems   in Sheet1, I tried sheet1c24  sheet2c24, but then when sheet2c24  , sheet1c24 displays 0 instead of nothing  in Sheet2, I tried sheet2c24  sheet1c24, but then the cells display the formula sheet1c24 instead of the value...p  pSo basically, what I want is that whatever change you do, in sheet1 or in sheet2, both columns in sheet1 and sheet2 are updated...

Negative 526 pHey, guys I am working on a project using HTC magic which requires the data from the electronic compass, including both the accelerometer and magnetic sensor. But I find that there is a significant latency between the move of the phone and the trigger of the sensorChanged event. In other word, the acceleration and magnetic data obtained from sensor are updated about half of a second after my motion. And I have several questions about the problem as follow.p  ol lipAre the orientation data computed by the acceleration and magnetic data Or are there a physical sensor for orientationpli lipDoes the latency result from the android API using the event or the physical limitation of the electronic compasspli lipIt is said that the model of the electronic compass is AK8976A from Asahi Kasei. Does anybody have the datasheet or know the frequency of the samplingpli lipAny idea to improve the realtime experiencepli ol  pThank you in advancep

However, the URLs of the tables that should not be shown are in the form HomeListTableTableName.p  pIf you leave out the MVC routing Routes.MapRoute then the tables with Scaffoldfalse are not shown. Or you can leave out only the Parameter defaults.p  pMy guess is that Dynamic Data determines if a table is visible by checking to see if a route can be made to for the List page.

Negative 526 pIve been given the following taskp  pAn external source will write a name, datetime and value to a database table table A at random intervals. I need to copy this data to another table table B and delete the row in table A. If the name doesnt exist in a lookup table then the row needs to remain in table A until it does and then copied over to table B.p  pDoes the above sound like a situation where a database trigger could be used effectively or would it be better creating an external app maybe windows service that checks the db every 5 min and performs the necessary updatesp  pUpdatep  pThis does not necessarily need to be instant thus if I used a windows service or task scheduler it would probably be set at 5 min intervals. It being virtually instant if a trigger is used is just a bonus of using a trigger, not a deciding factor.p  pMy main concern is that is this the correct way of using a trigger Should triggers be used to copy data or is this bad practise Also could have problems with using a trigger, for example if a copy fails could it lock the table stopping subsequent rows being copied If one copy takes too long will it not process the rows that have been inserted while it was bus If I dont use a trigger is there a better solution e.g. a windows service or console app using windows schedular  p  pThanksp

The example below illustrates my problemp  precodepublic class TestltTDataSourcegt      public IQueryableltTDataSourcegt DataSource  get set       public bool GetOneOrDefaultResult              var result  DataSource.SingleOrDefault         return result  defaultTDataSource       codepre  pYoull get an error on line 8 Operator  cannot be applied to operands of type TDataSource and TDataSource.. I thought using the default keyword would eliminate any comparison problems between reference types and value types. p  pAdding a generic constraint limiting TDataSource to reference types makes this piece of code compile.p  pCan somebody explain why the compiler wont fix this for me Is it just not smart enough to see this would workp  pThis is related  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions390900cantoperatorbeappliedtogenerictypesinchttpstackoverflow.comquestions390900cantoperatorbeappliedtogenerictypesincap  p[Edit] SLaks answer gave me some inspiration, the  operator wont work, but the Equals function should.p  precode    public class TestltTDataSourcegt      public IQueryableltTDataSourcegt DataSource  get set       public bool GetOneOrDefaultResult              var result  DataSource.SingleOrDefault         return result.EqualsdefaultTDataSource       codepre  pThis compiles would this function correctlyp

So I got to thinking it would be nice if the clients could be able to detect if there was any chat servers available on the network.p  pHow can I accomplish such a mechanism If you could point me in the right direction Id be grateful. p  pIm thinking the server would have to do some kind of broadcast, but Im not sure how to do this.p  pPS I know there probably are otherbetter ways of doing this, but for now Im specifically interested in how to make a client detect servers on the network.p  pAnd by server I mean the serverside part of the chat application, not like a Tomcat server.p
Negative 526 pI am always interested in learning new languages, a fact that keeps me on my toes and makes me I believe a better programmer. My attempts at conquering Haskell come and go  twice so far  and I decided it was time to try again. 3rd times the charm, rightp  pNope. I reread my old notes... and get disappointed p  pThe problem that made me lose faith last time, was an easy one permutations of integers. i.e. from a list of integers, to a list of lists  a list of their permutationsp  precode[int] gt [[int]] codepre  pThis is in fact a generic problem, so replacing int above with a, would still apply.p  pFrom my notesp  pI code it first on my own, I succeed. Hurrahp  pI send my solution to a good friend of mine  Haskell guru, it usually helps to learn from gurus  and he sends me this, which I am told, expresses the true power of the language, the use of generic facilities to code your needs. All for it, I recently drank the koolaid, lets gop  precodepermute  [a] gt [[a]] permute  foldr concatMap.ins [[]]    where ins x []      [[x]]          ins x yys  xyys[ yres  res lt ins x ys] codepre  pHmm. Lets break this downp  precodebash cat b.hs ins x []      [[x]] ins x yys  xyys[ yres  res lt ins x ys]  bash ghci Preludegt load b.hs [1 of 1] Compiling Main              b.hs, interpreted  Ok, modules loaded Main.  Maingt ins 1 [2,3] [[1,2,3],[2,1,3],[2,3,1]] codepre  pOK, so far, so good. Took me a minute to understand the second line of ins, but OK It places the 1st arg in all possible positions in the list. Cool.p  pNow, to understand the foldr and concatMap. in Real world Haskell, the DOT was explained...p  precodef . g x codepre  p...as just another syntax for...p  precodef g x  codepre  pAnd in the code the guru sent, DOT was used from a foldr, with the ins function as the fold collapsep  precodeMaingt let gconcatMap . ins Maingt g 1 [[2,3]] [[1,2,3],[2,1,3],[2,3,1]] codepre  pOK, since I want to understand how the DOT is used by the guru, I try the equivalent expression according to the DOT definition, f . g x  f g x ...p  precodeMaingt concatMap ins 1 [[2,3]]  ltinteractivegt111      Couldnt match expected type a gt [b]             against inferred type [[[t]]]      In the first argument of concatMap, namely ins 1 [[2, 3]]      In the expression concatMap ins 1 [[2, 3]]      In the definition of it it  concatMap ins 1 [[2, 3]] codepre  pWhat Why OK, I check concatMaps signature, and find that it needs a lambda and a list, but thats  just a human thinking how does GHC cope According to the definition of DOT above...p  precodef.gx  fg x,  codepre  p...what I did was valid, replacewisep  precodeconcatMap . ins x y  concatMap ins x y codepre  pScratching head...p  precodeMaingt concatMap ins 1 [[2,3]] [[1,2,3],[2,1,3],[2,3,1]] codepre  pSo... The DOT explanation was apparently too simplistic... DOT must be somehow clever enough to understand that we in fact wanted ins to get curried away and eat the first argument  thus becoming a function that only wants to operate on [t] and intersperse them with 1 in all possible positions. p  pBut where was this specified How did GHC knew to do this, when we invokedp  precodeMaingt concatMap . ins 1 [[2,3]] [[1,2,3],[2,1,3],[2,3,1]] codepre  pDid the ins signature somehow conveyed this... eat my first argument policyp  precodeMaingt info ins ins  t gt [t] gt [[t]]         Defined at b.hs102 codepre  pI dont see nothing special  ins is a function that takes a t,  a list of t, and proceeds to create a list with all interspersals. Nothing about eat your first argument and curry it away.p  pSo there... I am baffled. I understand after an hour of looking at the code what goes on, but... God almighty... Perhaps GHC makes attempts to see how many arguments it can peel offp  precode  lets try with no argument curried into ins,   oh gosh, boom,    lets try with one argument curried into ins,   yep, works,   that must be it, proceed codepre  pAgain  yikes...p  pAnd since I am always comparing the languages I am learning with what I already know, how would ins look in Python p  precodea[2,3] print [a[x][1]a[x] for x in xrangelena1]  [[1, 2, 3], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1]] codepre  pBe honest, now... which is simplerp  pI mean, I know I am a newbie in Haskell, but I feel like an idiot... Looking at 4 lines of code for an hour, and ending up assuming that the compiler... tries various interpretations until it finds something that clicksp  pTo quote from Lethal weapon, I am too old for this...p

Each resolution is about the same as accessing the temp reference created by the codeWithcode statement, so there is littletono gain in performance.p
Negative 526 pIn my iPhone app, Ive been able to use NSURLConnection properly to download data from a URL. I simply set the codedelegatecode to my UIView, and make sure that I set up the UIView to answer for the proper delegate functions such as codeconnectiondidReceiveResponsecode. However, if I have a number of NSURLConnections either for a similar type of request, or multiple kinds of requests, it gets messy because the delegate functions, such as codedidReceiveRequestcode, dont differentiate between the different requests. The advantage of asynchronous requests is that you are supposed to be able to multiple at once, without blocking the main thread. strongWhats the best practice for how to use multiple NSURLConnection requests at the same timestrongp

Negative 526 pI am looking at implementing some performance optimization around my javascriptcss. In particular looking to achieve the minification and combining of such. I am developing in .netc web applications.p  pI have a couple of options and looking for feedback on eachp  pFirst one is this clever tool I came across Chirpy which via visual studio combines, minifies etc  a hrefhttpchirpy.codeplex.comhttpchirpy.codeplex.coma This is a visual studio add in but as I am in a team environment, this tool isnt ideal.p  pMy next option is to use an Msbuild task httpyuicompressor.codeplex.com to minify the files and also combine them maybe read from an xml file what needs to be combined. While this works for minifying fine, the concern I have is that I will have to maintain what must be combined which could be a headache.p  p3rd option is to use msbuild task just for the minifying and at runtime using some helper classes, combine the files on a per page basis. This would combine the files, give it a name and add a version to it.p  pAny other options I could consider My concern with the last option is that it may have performance issues as I would have to open the file from the local drive, read its contents and then combine the files. This is alot of processing at run time. I was looking at something like Squishit  a hrefhttpsgithub.comjetheredgeSquishItdownloadshttpsgithub.comjetheredgeSquishItdownloadsa This minifies the files at run time but I would look at doing this at compile time.p  pSo any feedback on my approaches would be great If the 3rd option would not cause performance issues, I am leading towards it. p

Negative 526 pSome explanation  for a project Im working on I have to write a program that is running in the background, detects changes to files, and uploads the modified files to a web service to make it available to others. Quite simple synchronization if it were not for the case when a user modifies a big file and decides to shutdown its computer right after the edit. p  pI could cancel the upload and wait for the next reboot to do the upload, but I can imagine the user downloading the file from the web to another computer the next morning and dont understanding why his changes from last night arent there.p  pSo my idea was to detect when the users logs off or reboots Windows, and if Im in the middle of an upload, just asking the user Were still synchronizing file Foo.txt that you just changed. Are you sure you want to reboot  Youre changes wont be available to others until you restart your computer . If the users says no, Id need to cancel the rebootloging offp  pIs this possible p

Pasted from wikipediap blockquote  pFor a user query Height of mount Everest from the paragraph I need to get 29002 ft or 8840 m as the answer. Can anyone please suggest any possible ways of doing it in Java  Are there any open source libraries for the samep

Negative 526 pThe built in DecimalFormat only allows you to specify number of digits to the right of the decimal place.p  pBecause of the limitations of representing numbers as double, number formatting needs to include some level of rounding inside of it. In the general case, that rounding has to be to a number of significant digits default case is the precision of a double or else your formatted double will end up showing stuff like 3.5999999 instead of 3.6.p  pThe closest solution I could find is usingp  precodenew BigDecimaldouble, new MathContext14, RoundingMode.HALFEVEN.stripTrailingZeros.toPlainString codepre  phowever, that only provides a single format. If I need to format it generally group separator, decimal separator, limit to number of digits, padding, etc., there is nothing in the JDK library.p  pIs there a general number formatting library out there that will handle rounding to significant digits properlyp  pSomeone asked for examples.

But how can you modify luminance itself  For instance, how can I increase the red channel luminance using a 5x5 matrix  Ultimately this will be used in C but the same math should work wjava or flash.p

Negative 526 pIm seeing a really strange issue with JPopupMenus and JComboBoxs. When the application is under heavy load, there are times when our popup menus appear with the right size and position, but just as blank, grey boxes.p  pThe other issue we think is related is that sometimes, we see stanards JComboBoxs appear as though they have no items in them i.e., they dont pull down. Weve seen this issue when the application is not under load. Theyre not making database calls, or anything like that to populate the combo box items  they use hardcoded items.p  pIve put the popup menu creation in a SwingUtils.invokelater call, and that helped, but did not make the problem completely go away. I dont know what I would do to change the combo boxs behavior. If we just rightclick again, the context menu will reappear  fully populated. To get the combo boxes working right again, we just close the dialog that contains them, and then just open it back up.p  pWere using Java 1.6.17 in a standard desktop app. Is there a bug I dont know about, or something else that would solve it, or at least help us know what else might be going onp

Negative 526 pI have a situation where I need to mock a thirdparty interface and call a thirdparty extension method that interacts with my componentundertest.  Its hard to figure out what exactly I need to verify on the mocked interface, and Im wondering if its possible to trace whatever interactions Moq recorded so I can see what actually went on.  From that, I am hoping to be able to code a meaningful expectation.   I dont see any evidence that this can be done in the API docs, but it seems like the technology is there and maybe is exposed somewhere that I havent found.p  pThanksp

Negative 526 pWhat I want is somewhat similar to what happens in a WinForm designer in Visual Studio, say VS2010. If I place a button and select it and use arrow keys, it will move around by 5 pixels in whatever direction I chose by pressing the right key. Now, if I hold either a Shift or a Ctrl modifier as I do that forgot which one, sorry, then the button will move only by 1 pixel at a time.p  pI want this to happen with my NumericUpDown control in a C WinForm app. Lets say a default increment is 100.0, and a smaller increment is 10.0. An even smaller increment if possible can be 1.0. Any hints on how can I do that p  pHopefully I do not need to ask this as a separate question I am also toying with the idea of having the increment be dependent on the current value entered. Say, I can enter a dollar amount anywhere between 1 and 100 billion. I then want the default, small, and smaller increment  values be dependent on the value entered. I can figure out the exact formula myself.p

Negative 526 pyou could imagine an xaml service that exposes a receive activity. This is the first activity in my worklow. Behind this receive there are simple activities as  InitializateCorrelation, assign, delay... whatever. Then I have a custom activity that was made with the activity designer. So I really have a code activity in my main workflow. This offers a drag and drop zone to allow to a developer customize the activity.

Negative 526 pWe are developing several separate applicationsmodules, that we deploy onto Glassfish 3.1.1 application server. There are cases where these applications need to call each others methods, through a remote interface. What is the best practice when it comes to packaging these remote interfaces E.g. if A needs to call Bs remote interface, would you extract Bs remote interface in a separate JAR file and package it together with module A What if this remote interface references an entity class. Would you package this entity class together with the interface in this JAR filep  pIf you have any feedback on this topic, feel free to suggest how you think this should be done.p

Negative 526 pBackground I have an application with an alternate entry point. It listenes for SMS and Email sent events. The application get launched normally from the Download folder by user and also when an SMS or Email is sent upon user confirmation. When the application is launching, I have to pull out some flags from persistent storage to make some decisions. The application is signed properly by RIM provided keys. It is also signed by a key using signing authority tool to make the persistent storage isolated for this application.p  pProblem When launching normally from the menu, the data from persistent storage can be pulled out without any problem. But when launching from the alternate entry point from SMS and Email sent event, the persistent storage is not accessible and the ControlledAccess exception is shown. Note that, I tried allowing all kinds of permissions for the applicaiton.p  pPossible Reason Although the application .cod file is properly signed by the key, it is being considered not signed when launching from alternate entry point. Thus the access to the persistent storage is not allowed.p  pI am looking for a solution or any suggestion that might help me troubleshoot the problem. Otherwise, I will have to drop off the feature of isolated persistent storage which I really dont want to.p

Negative 526 pIm relatively new to C and Office automation and recently I found myself trying to obtain a reference to someones Outlook inbox and sorting the emails by Received time.  It wasnt working until I found a solution elsewhere on the web where the Inbox is assigned to a local variable of type Microsoft.Office.Interop.Outlook.Items and then the sort is performed on the local variable and it works.  The question, however, is why  I thought that in C objects are references and when you declare a new Outlook.Inbox reference and then assign it the Items from the users Inbox, it simply serves as an additional pointer to the actual emails, and DOES NOT actually copy each of the emails to a new collection.  So it should be no different than calling Sort on the original reference, right  Obviously Im wrong, so Id appreciate an explanation.  Thanx p  precodeusing Outlook  Microsoft.Office.Interop.Outlook     ...

Negative 526 pI made an swt.graphics.Image object of a draw2d Layer containing draw2d polylines and few other figures like circles ellipses etc. I made a jpeg file from this Image object, all I can see are the ellipses, circles etc but no figures drawn using draw2d polylinesconnection arrows, PolygonShapes etc are present in the final jpeg file. I want the polylines also to be plotted and visible in the final jpeg file. Any ideas how i can do this I have tried putting the Layer in a shell. But I have to displaywhich i should not do the shell to the user using shell.open only then the polyline shapes are visible in the final jpeg file. I guess the shell.open forces the drawing of the shell and its children  the Layer, the polylines etc. Is there are any workaround for not showing the shell but force the drawing on Layer for polylinesp  pThanks and Regards Bharathp

But is there a way to print text to coordinates in Python For example, if I wanted to print the string A at the 3rd row and 5th column of the command window, how could I do that I found ways to get around it and print two different strings at different coordinates using n for rows and repeating spaces for columns, but its just too tedious to write the code.p

Negative 526 pI am running fulltext queries on multiple tables on MySQL 5.5.22. The application uses innodb tables, so I have created a few MyISAM tables specifically for fulltext searches.p  pFor example, some of my tables look likep  precodeaccountsearch  id accountid name description hobbies interests  productsearch  id productid name type description reviews codepre  pAs these tables are solely for fulltext search, they are denormalized. Data can come from multiple tables and are agregated into the search table. Besides the ID columns, the rest of the columns are assigned to 1 fulltext index.p  pTo work around the 50 rule with fulltext searches, I am using codeIN BOOLEAN MODEcode.p  pSo for the above, I would runp  precodeSELECT , MATCHname, type, description, reviews AGAINSTjohn as relevance FROM productsearch WHERE MATCHname, type, description, reviews AGAINSTjohn IN BOOLEAN MODE LIMIT 10  SELECT , MATCHname, description, hobbies, interests AGAINSTjohn as relevance FROM accountsearch WHERE MATCHname, description, hobbies, interests AGAINSTjohn IN BOOLEAN MODE LIMIT 10 codepre  pLets just assume that we have products called john as well Pp  pThe problem I am facing arep  ul lipTo get meaningful relevance, I need to use a search without codeIN BOOLEAN MODEcode. This means that the search is subjected to the 50 rule and word length rules. So, quite often, if I most of the products in the codeproductsearchcode table is called codejohncode, their relevance would be returned as 0.pli lipRelevances between multiple queries are not comparable.

My issue however, is it there a way to dynamically update the image rotator without refreshing the site pagep  pSo basically you are displaying ten images then 1 hour later you have a script delete the old images add ten new images and a new xml file, do you need to do a refresh of the page Or does the script always dynamically check the xml file, so you dont have to do a refresh.p  pp.s. it doesnt have to be in jQuery, could be HTML5 or the likes  I just want to be able to add and remove images from a folder, and have the rotator automatically update to use whats in the folderp

Negative 526 pSimple enough situation. Ive got a MongoDB database with a bunch of information from a previous developer. However I have limited information on the model that came before hand and I DONT have access to the original model class. Ive been tinkering with the MongoDB driver to get some more information on it MongoID will have to be used eventually to map the object back out as follows.p  precodeThe flow is as follows   Connection   Databases   Database   Collection   Hash Info    Setup the connection. you can supply attributes in the form of db,portno but most of the time it will pick up the defaults   conn  MongoConnection.new    Database info   mongodbinfo conn.databasenames   conn.databaseinfo.each  info puts info.inspect      db  conn.dbdbnamehere   db.collectionnames.each  collection puts collection.inspect       collection  db.collectionmodelnamehere   puts collection.inspect    collection.find.each  row     puts row.inspect     puts row.class    codepre  pEach row is a separate object and as MongoDB works, each objectdocument is a BSON object.p  pSo the bottom line question is How do i deserialize the BSON into a model using mongoIDp  pP.s Feel free to use the above code if your trying to figure out a new mongoDB, its been handy for debugging IMHO.p
Negative 526 pI have a modal view that comes up requiring the user to verify hisher email before continuing.

Negative 526 pI have a plugin architecture for my desktop app.  Ive implemented it in a fairly standard way using a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibrarymacdocumentationCocoaConceptualLoadingCodeConceptsPlugins.html relnofollowApples code loading guidea.p  pI have a single protocol which defines all the methods an instance of the plugin can or should respond to.p  pThe only problem is this protocol defines around 80 methods.  Only about 10 of these methods are compulsory and the rest are optional.  Some plugins will implement all 80 methods, whereas others will only implement the basic 10.p  pThe usual way for a plugin bundle to tell its host application which class to instantiate is via the codeNSPrincipalClasscode key in its Info.plist file.  This is a single key so only a single class can be instantiated.p  pThe plugin protocol is a single file and its expected that it will be used by this single class.p  pMy question is what is the best way of splitting up the functionality inside this single protocol into perhaps multiple protocols, whilst at the same time allowing the plugin writer to have a more flexible implementationp  pCurrently my existing plugins have the following in their principal classp  precode BOOLrespondsToSelectorSELselector      return [self forwardingTargetForSelectorselector]  YES  NO    idforwardingTargetForSelectorSELselector      id target  nil     if [self.instanceOne respondsToSelectorselector]          target  self.instanceOne      else if [self.instanceTwo respondsToSelectorselector]          target  self.instanceTwo      else if [self.instanceThree respondsToSelectorselector]          target  self.instanceThree           return target  codepre  pBut rather than imposing it upon the plugin writer to define an ad hoc system like this, I would like the applications plugin framework to accomodate a more flexible solution.p

Negative 526 pThere are several questions out there that ask about converting colors between colorspaces on Apple platforms. Unfortunately, the answers quite often involve codeNSColorcode or codeUIColorcode  non portable ObjectiveC classes that cannot be interchangeably used on OS X and iOS.p  pSo Id like to ask a very specific thing that Im strongsurestrong there must be a good answer to out there. I simply cannot believe that Apple would not foresee the need for this.p  pHow does one convert codeCGColorcode from one colorspace for example, monochrome to another one for example, RGB in a generic way, supporting all codeCGColorSpacecode types, while using solely the portable Core Graphics functionsp  hr  pSome context. I need to multiply the value provided by an online service with a value stored in codeUIColorcode. Correct way to extract the RGB components prior to iOS5, which finally introduced the method code[UIColor getRedgreenbluealpha]code, is to use codeCGColorGetComponentscode. I then multiply this color with the color fetched from the online service. This fails in case code[UIColor grayColor]code was used to generate the codeUIColorcode. Meaning, I need to convert the color from the greyscale colorspace into RGB. In this case, its easy. What about some other colorspace being provided Or what if in a theoretical future scenario I just want to process a single pixels colorp  pThere is a suggestion somewhere that I paint a pixel into a bitmap context and then read this pixel. Thats insane, and I hope it isnt the only way to do this. Obviously the drawing method can figure out how to perform the conversion how can we leverage this without creating a bitmap context solely to draw a pixel in itp  hr  pAdditional researchp  ul lia hrefhttpweb.archive.orgweb20091025015651httpofcodeandmen.poltras.com20090122convertacgcolorreftoanothercgcolorspacerefThis articlea on color conversion, aside from codeUIColorcodes undocumentedprivate method codestyleStringcode, more interestingly mentions also undocumented codeCGColorTransformcodes.li lia hrefhttpwww.opensource.apple.comsourceWebCoreWebCore737.5platformgraphicscgColorCG.cppColorCG.cpp from WebKita suggests there is a header named codeCoreGraphicsCGColorTransform.hcode.

Negative 526 pI have a rather sticky problem for which Ive done a lot of research but have had no luck in finding a solution.p  pI have a web application comprised of Tomcat servlets. Tomcat is running on a Windows 2008 R2 server and uses the Apache ISAPI Redirector 1.2.37 in IIS for redirection tofrom Tomcat uses ajp13.p  pMy application manages a library of XML files. When requested by a client browser, a servlet uses XSL to transform the XML file to HTML.  The HTML is passed back to IIS thence back to the browser for display. Xalan is the implementation used for JAXP javax.xml.transform.  This architecture has worked well for several years.p  pRecently, we upgraded from Xalan 2.7.0 to 2.7.1 and discovered the HTML for some XML files is being truncated when viewed in the browser.  p  pAfter some trialanderror investigation, here is what we knowp  ol liTruncation only occurs when the source XML file is  1.7 MB.li liThe HTML is truncated at the same location every time. buffer size issueli liI tried redirecting the output from Xalan directly to a file ... no truncation.li lipTruncation only occurs when Xalan 2.7.1 is used with IIS 7p  pXalan 2.7.1  IIS 7  truncationp  pXalan 2.7.1  IIS 6  no truncationp  pXalan 2.7.0  IIS 7  no truncationpli lipThe ISAPI redirector log contains the following messagesp  precode[error] isapiwriteclientjkisapiplugin.c 1250 WriteClient failed with 534 0x00000216        [info] ajpprocesscallbackjkajpcommon.c 1945 Writing to client aborted or client network problems  [info] ajpservicejkajpcommon.c 2607 ajp13w sending request to tomcat failed unrecoverable, because of client write error attempt1  [info] servicejklbworker.c 1400 service failed, worker ajp13w is in local error state  [info] servicejklbworker.c 1419 unrecoverable error 200, request failed.

Negative 526 pAfter pulling my hair out trying to get my local IIS server to not encode colons in MediaWiki links turning codehttplocalhostwikiCategoryPeoplecode into codehttplocalhostwikiCategory3APeoplecode Im beginning to think that such a feat is impossible. Of particular interest is that both links work when entered, its just that all the links throughout the wiki display as the encoded version. Since both work, its purely a visual annoyance, but one I would like to solve if possible.p  pAs an alternative, Im wondering if it is possible to merely change the display of the links. If MediaWikiIIS is so insistent on encoding colons in URLs, fine, but is it possible to show the user the colon, regardless of what the actual link isp  pI understand that colons in urls on windows servers are not allowed because they would open access to data file streams, but as this is a private wiki running on my local machine, I would not be opposed to disabling this security precaution if possible.p  pI originally posted this question on the MediaWiki Users Forum back in June, but have not received any help in solving the issue. That thread can be found at a hrefhttpwww.mwusers.comforumsshowthread.php18722IIS7.5PercentencodingallcolonsinURLs relnofollowhttpwww.mwusers.comforumsshowthread.php18722IIS7.5PercentencodingallcolonsinURLsa.p  pAny help would be greatly appreciated.p  pThanks.p
Negative 526 pI have a problem with refreshing my ListViews. I have a TabActivity calling another TabActivitySubTabActivity calling a ListActivity. My ListView gets Data from an XML file from a Webserver. In my Customized Header I have a Button to reload refresh the ListView. When I change the subTab I call the onTabChangedMethod to redraw the List with other Data.p  pMy problem now is I can refresh the ListView only before I make the first Tab Change. After I changed the Tap I can only refresh the second list. When I move back to the first list I cant refresh both. I can only get new data from my XML file but i cant show it.

Negative 526 pI recently took over a project written in C and C that will be compiled using the MS Visual Studio 2003 compiler. Since I have a little lack on experience with compiler settings and compiler output I want to know if the given setup realy makes a difference according to compilation output or performance.p  pThe project uses a mixture of C and C. The main part is written in C but uses some classes written in C.  So the first part of the question is does the MS VS 2003 compiler makes a difference per file compiling plain c for .cpp files using only c functionality and compiling c style for files using the classes  Could there be a reason for using that performance boost, backward compatibilityp  pThe project also does not use trycatch blocks since it is not plain C. But the exception handling options in the compiler settings are not disabled. So the second part of the question could there be still a performance boost or any other logical reason for not using trycatch but NOT disabling it in the compilerp  pYes, I am quite confused by this setup and trying to understand.p

If you could give me an idea i would be very grateful.p  pThis is the problem You are given a connected undirected graph which has N vertices and N edges. Each vertex has a cost. You have to find a subset of vertices so that the total cost of the vertices in the subset is minimum, and each edge is incident with at least one vertex from the subset.p  pThank you in advancep  pP.S I have tought about a solution for a long time, and the only ideas i came up with are backtracking or an minimum cost matching in bipartite graph but both ideas are too slow for N100000.p

Negative 526 pI have a DataGrid containing a number of DataGridTemplateColumns. One of these has Width and the rest have WidthAuto. Most just contain a TextBox. I want a margin on each side of each element, so in the style assigned to the TextBox I had Margin10,1. What I observed was that the initial width of the DataGrid would be too wide. If the window was manually made thinner, the DataGrid would also go thinner but maintaining the overwidth. If the window was made larger, the DataGrid would not get wider until its width was correct, and from then on resizing would work correctly. p  pIf I remove the margin from the style and place it explicitly in the TextBox of each column then everything works as expected, so my problem is solved. But Id still like to know whats going on since if I want to change those margins itll be far better to have one style to change. Is this some odd bug in the DataGrid or something Im not understanding correctlyp  pThe DataGrid is nested inside some other items, but because the fix is so trivial it makes me think the DataGrid and styles are the only significant factors.p  pColumns look like thisp  precodeltDataGridTemplateColumn xNameSKUColumn             HeaderSKU              WidthAutogt     ltDataGridTemplateColumn.CellTemplategt         ltDataTemplategt             ltTextBox xNameskuText                      TextBinding PathSKU, ModeTwoWay, UpdateSourceTriggerPropertyChanged                       StyleStaticResource textBodyCellgt         ltDataTemplategt     ltDataGridTemplateColumn.CellTemplategt ltDataGridTemplateColumngt codepre  pand textBodyCell looks like thisp  precodeltStyle xKeytextBodyCell TargetTypexType TextBoxgt     ltSetter PropertyFontSize             ValueStaticResource bodySize gt     ltSetter PropertyTextWrapping ValueNoWrapgt     ltSetter PropertyAcceptsReturn ValueFalsegt     ltSetter PropertyMargin Value10,1gt     ltSetter PropertyTemplate ValueDynamicResource DataGridCellTextBoxgt  ltStylegt codepre  pwhere DataGridCellTextBox isp  precodeltControlTemplate xKeyDataGridCellTextBox TargetTypexType TextBoxBasegt      ltScrollViewer xNamePARTContentHost ForegroundStaticResource DataGridUnSelectedRowForeground SnapsToDevicePixelsTemplateBinding SnapsToDevicePixelsgt      ltControlTemplate.Triggersgt         ltDataTrigger BindingBinding IsSelected, RelativeSourceRelativeSource FindAncestor, AncestorTypexType DataGridRow ValueTruegt             ltSetter PropertyForeground  ValueStaticResource DataGridSelectedRowForeground gt         ltDataTriggergt             ltDataTrigger BindingBinding IsSelected, RelativeSourceRelativeSource FindAncestor, AncestorTypexType DataGridRow ValueFalsegt             ltSetter PropertyForeground  ValueStaticResource DataGridUnSelectedRowForeground gt         ltDataTriggergt                    ltTrigger PropertyIsEnabled ValueFalsegt             ltSetter PropertyForeground ValueDynamicResource xStatic SystemColors.GrayTextBrushKeygt         ltTriggergt     ltControlTemplate.Triggersgt ltControlTemplategt codepre

Negative 526 pI have one project functioning perfectly using Unity. I try switching to use SimpleInjector instead and now NO changes ever get saved in my database.

MVC is the client for the unity example, but Im changing to a WPF project and SimpleInjector. Any suggestions are much appreciated. Thanks.p  hr  pSteven. Thanks for your comment. I just discovered that since my RepositoryBase and my UnitOfWork inject an IDatabaseFactory in their constructors that I needed to use container.RegisterSingle. This resolved one issue. I still have a problem with lifetime though. Since my consuming app is WPF, how will the RegisterPerWebRequest work p  pMy project has a DataLayer  BusinessLayer  WcfService  WPF Front end. SimpleInjector is set on the WcfService project and the business layer has Boostrapper to register items there. As of now, my WPF client will GetAllCountries and display in a grid. If I change the name of one and try to update, I get the An object with the same key already exists in the ObjectStateManager. The ObjectStateManager cannot track multiple objects with the same key. error. Ive done some debugging and find that after the GetCountries service call in the WPF client, when I go back to try to update, I see ALL of the countries are attached to the context via dbContext.ChangeTracker.Entries. At this point I should have NO entities being tracked as my context should have been disposed after the first unit of work. p  pIn an MVC app the RegiserPerWebRequest fixes that, but what is the equivalent for WPF Im going to install the extension now and try it anyway but I have a feeling it isnt the solution Im looking for.. or is it Thanks again for the help.p  hr  pOK. I did a bit more digging and found a solution that works. Im just not sure if its the correct one. Anyway, now in my BLL where there is a bootstrapper to register things, I can register like thisp  precodecontainer.RegisterPerWcfOperationltIDatabaseFactory, DatabaseFactorygt container.RegisterPerWcfOperationltIUnitOfWork, UnitOfWorkgt container.RegisterPerWcfOperationltICountryRepository, CountryRepositorygt codepre  pThat gives me what I was looking for. Only a single instance of DatabaseFactory is ever created and thus my repository and unit of work share it like they should. Also, after GetCountries on the client, when I do my second call to the service to perform and update, I check the dbContext.ChangeTracker.Entries and see that there are NO entities being tracked, which is correct. I can now attach, set to modify, and call SaveChanges without getting the duplicate key error. Does this seem ok Thanks.p

Negative 526 pConsider a web application that displays the contents of users refrigerator. Among other things, a list of fruits currently in the fridge needs to be displayed. Each type of fruit needs a very different display. Most importantly, there will be a large number of different fruit types.p  pI want to implement this using a Mustache template library, but Im not quite sure what the best approach is.p  pFor starters, here are the templates for each fruitp  precode apple.mustache  A appleType apple from groceryStore   orange.mustache  An orange from countryOfOrigin   banana.mustache  A ripeness banana  ...many more templates here... codepre  pstrongApproach 1strongp  pHave a view model or view helper object prepare the template data by creating a isBananaisOrangeetc. key that will be passed to the template.

However, I cant see how it will scale the fridge template must be modified every time a new fruit type is added. It also seems to be going against Mustaches logicless philosophy.p  pstrongApproach 2strongp  pMake the view model be responsible for determining the correct template for each fruit type, rendering it, and returning the HTML as data for the template. The fridge template would now look something likep  precodeYou have the following food in your fridge  fruits codepre  pAnd the view modelp  precodeclass InventoryViewModel       ...      function getFruits              foreach thisgtfridgegtgetFruits as fruit              if fruit instanceof Banana                  html . thisgtmustachegtrender...              elseif fruit instanceof Apple                  html . thisgtmustachegtrender...              else                   ...                                return html       codepre  pThe seems better than the first option, but it requires injecting a mustache template rendering object into each view model.

Negative 526 pI have discovered here the most part of the answers about programming, but as I cant find some way to fix my problem, I have decided to join this community to receive your help, so thanks in advancep  pI am developing remote biometric authentication service via internet. In this system, I have clients that access to some internet services like online banking...etc. connecting for this purpose to content providers. These servers require biometric authentication from the clients, so they execute remotely a biometric application using Java Web Start which allow connecting to external server where the biometric comparison process is done so there is a server that makes authentication as a external service, and then, the results of the authentication are sent to the content provider. The problem is the next onep  pI need to send the results of the authentication a simple boolean with some session id to identify the user that wants to authenticate himselves, from the server that has done the process to the content provider server, but without storing the result in any database or static place. I need to be something dynamic that reside only in the memory.

Negative 526 pI am working in a company, and for some reason, Im being dumped to do statistics. p  pIm given a load of data dumps, and I am made to do some really repetitive data massage.p  pThe first solution, obviously, is to write a script to do this for me. I cant. I am not allowed to download servers into my PC, being a PHP programmer, I cant do this.p  pSecondly, I thought of importing these txt files into a MySQL database and running queries on them.

Negative 526 pI am new to using C libraries in C and also to the C programming in general. I have a DLL built from a C code which I believe is a managed code as the name of the DLL is TestManaged.dll. I am not 100 sure if the dllC code is managedunmanaged.p  pI want to use classes and methods of this DLL in my codeC windows forms applicationcode code. There are multiple classes in this DLL. When I chekced these classes and methods inside those classes in codeObject Browsercode, all of them have codePubliccode identifier.p  pSo far, I have added this DLL to my references of C application code. There are three classes I would talk about in my question codeProductcode, codeReqStatuscode, codeProductDatacode. I could create an objects for various classes of this DLL as follows. p  precodeProduct testCall  new ProductClass codepre  pThere is another class called codeProductDatacode in this DLL and I could get the C code for this class which is as follows. In this case, codeProductDatacode is shown as class in codeObject Browsercode in C where as it is actually a struct in C code. I am not sure if this is important to answer my question at the end. p  pFollowing is a C code that defines codeProductDatacode struct  codeProductData.hcode file. p  precodeifdef WIN32MANAGED  public ref  struct ProductData else struct ProductData endif      UINT32 ProductId           lt Product ID         UINT32 PRoductRev         lt Build Revision  codepre  pFollowing is a C code that defines codeReqStatuscode enum  codeReqStatus.hcode file.

So following is the declaration of the codegerProductDatacode method as seen in the codeObject Browsercodep  precodepublic ReqStatus getProductDataProductData data codepre  pThe same methods C delcaration is The actual method is too long and hence just giving the declaration This method is inside codeProdcut.cppcode filep  precodeReqStatus ProductgetProductDataProductData PLATFORMPTR data codepre  pPLATFORMPTR is defined as below in codePlatform.hcodep  precodeifdef WIN32MANAGED define PLATFORMPTR  else define PLATFORMPTR  endif codepre  pMethod 2 is a codegetConnectedcode method inside codeProductcode class which accepts a character array I am not sure of this and an object of codeProductDatacode type as a parameter and returns the codeReqStatuscode which is an enum type in C.

Negative 526 pIm very new to Seam and am just getting used to the different components available. Im wondering which one I should use for this situation. p  pThe answer to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4317684whenshouldiusehoutputlinkinsteadofhcommandlinkthisa question explains the difference between codelthoutputLinkgtcode and codelthcommandLinkgtcode, that codelthoutputLinkgtcode produces just a basic HTML link tag with GET request and codelthcommandLinkgtcode submits a POST via a click event. p  pI just want to attach a simple jQuery click event to a link. I dont want the link to redirect to anywhere or submit a form.

Negative 526 pI use GeForce cards for GPGPU computations with CUDA. A well known problem is that the WDDM introduces a huge overhead on the CPU side, leading to a nonnegligible latency increase.p  pAlso I need to run these programs in MS Windows environment and I would like to do it in modern systems like Windows 7 x64.p  pSo, is there any way I can make Windows 7 work with XPDM I think it was possible in Vista and maybe even in Windows 7 x86 not sure tho.p  pTCC mode is only available for Tesla products products I can not afford and neither I need the features they offer over GeForce. Is there any workaround for making a GeForce work in TCC modep  pThanks in advance, Javierp
Negative 526 pI am writing a benchmarking tool to run against a web application. The problem that I am facing is that the first request to the server always takes significantly longer than subsequent requests. I have experienced this problem with the apache http client 3.x, 4.x and the a hrefhttpscode.google.compgooglehttpjavaclient relnofollowGoogle http clienta. The apache http client 4.x shows the biggest difference first request takes about seven times longer than subsequent ones. For Google and 3.x it is about 3 times longer.p  pMy tool has to be able to benchmark simultaneous requests with threads. I can not use one instance of e.g. HttpClient and call it from all the threads, since this throws a Concurrent exception. Therefore, I have to use an individual instance in each thread, which will only execute a single request. This changes the overall results dramatically.p  pI do not understand this behavior. I do not think that it is due to a caching mechanism on the server because a the webapp under consideration does not employ any caching to my knowledge and b this effect is also visible when first requesting www.hostxy.com and afterwards www.hostxy.commywebapp.p  pI use System.nanoTime immediately before and after calling codeclient.executegetcode or codeget.executecode, respectively.p  pDoes anyone have an idea where this behavior stems from Do these httpclients themselves do any caching I would be very grateful for any hints.p

Negative 526 pI have a program that can successfully read a CSV file. The said CSV file is a list separated by 3 columns. And each column has a comma in between each line. For instancep  pline 1  artist, genre, song line 2  Michael jackson, Pop, thrillerp  pand so on. What I want my program to do is read the first line and to take artist, genre, and song, print those out to the user as options. For instancep  pChoose an Option 1. Artist 2. Genre 3. Songp  pand then when they select an option it then shows them either all the artists, songs, or genres in the CSV file.p  pSo far I have my program reading the CSV and putting each line in a vector. Here is my code so far ...p  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt include ltsstreamgt include ltstringgt include ltfstreamgt include ltvectorgt using namespace std int main      ifstream infilemusiclist.csv     string line       vectorltstringgt allwords     cout ltlt Hello     while getlineinfile, line              stringstream strstrline         string word           while getlinestrstr,word, ,                      allwords.pushbackword                   for unsigned i  0 i lt allwords.size i                      cout ltlt allwords.atiltlt n                    systempause     return 0  codepre  pIm just having trouble figuring out how to have it read the first line, separate each string in the first line that is already separated by a comma and have that then outputted to the user as an option. So in essence I can change artist, genre, song to something like appetizers, dish, drinks in the CSV file.p

Negative 526 pI have read a ton of articles on writing to the internal storage of an android device, and I need some help figuring out what I am doing wrong.  In the main activity of my app, I read a value from a file stored in the internal storage like thisp  precodestring ID  GetID codepre  pWhere GetID looks like thisp  precodestring GetID              try                       using var i  new StreamReader OpenFileInput FILENAME                               return i.ReadToEnd                                  catch                       return                codepre  pIf the file doesnt exist,  is returned and the user is sent off to another activity to register. In that activity, I use this to call a function to write to internal storage like thisp  precodeWriteID uniqueID codepre  pWhere WriteID looks like thisp  precodevoid WriteIDstring uniqueID              using var o  new StreamWriter              OpenFileOutput FILENAME, FileCreationMode.Private             o.Write uniqueID      codepre  pThis is where it gets weird for me, if I put these two functions in the same activity, write to the file and then call the function to read from it, I get uniqueID returned correctly. However if I stop the app and then restart it, I get a File Not Found exception thrown and nothing returned from the read function. However, if I create a new project, and use the same code, everything works as expected file is created and written to, then on restart the data persists. p  pSo I am thinking there is some setting that I have changed or some reference that I may be missing in my original app that causes the internal storage file to be removed  when the app is stoppedp  pAny ideas as to why this works correctly in my test app, but not in the otherp

After animation is finished all not tapped previously buttons say a view containing these buttons should be available again.br So I have a Layout which includes another layout with these 30 buttonsp  precode...     ltRelativeLayout         androidididalphabetContainer         androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent         androidlayoutheightwrapcontentgt          ltinclude layoutlayoutalphabet gt     ltRelativeLayoutgt ... codepre  pNow I need to lock the buttons from being clicked and then unlock. So I triedp  precode... private RelativeLayout alphabetPanel ... public void onCreate ... alphabetPanel  RelativeLayout findViewByIdR.id.alphabetContainer ...  ... private void lockButtons alphabetPanel.setEnabledfalse  codepre  pbut this doesnt lock buttons. I also tried p  precodealphabetPanel.setFocusablefalse alphabetPanel.setClickablefalse codepre  pDoesnt help either. Seems like it all relies only to a layout by itself but not the views it contains. br Also I tried to add a fake layout to place it over layout with buttons by bringing it to the front. This is a workaround and its tricky cuz both layouts must be placed inside a RelativeLayout onlyp  precode...         blockingLayout  new RelativeLayoutthis         blockingLayout.setLayoutParamsalphabetPanel.getLayoutParams ... codepre  pbut this works very strange somehow both layouts in this case appears and disappears every second or so or doesnt appear at all  I cant understand that at all cuz there is no codesetVisibilitycode method used in code br The only one way left is to iterate every view button to make it disabled and than back.br Is there any other waybr strongUPDATEstrongbr Finally I had to add a walllayout into the xml. Now by making it clickable and focusable it becomes a solution.p

Negative 526 pI have started learning Entity Framework recently and not sure what to search for this task. p  pI have an Entity called codeEstimatedEffortcode with property codeStatuscode which can be codeActive, Inactive, TBDcode. Now using my previous experience with C, I might have created an Enum for status with three values and kept codeStatuscode field of integer type in codeEstimatedEffortcode database table. How I can achieve the same using Entity Framework Designerp  pMy first approach I found that you cant use enums in Entity Framework, so I decided to create a separate entity for codeStatuscode which means I am keeping a separate table for codeStatuscode in Database. But how I add  codeActive, Inactive, TBDcode values to it using designer p  pI read that we can create and use our codeInsert, Update, Deletecode stored procedure and I might create an insert stored procedure to add default values. But before pursuing further on this approach, I thought to consider asking whether Im going on right track or Im missing something. Thanksp  pstrongEnum type not available in property typesstrong   p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comhKm9g.png altenter image description herep

Negative 526 pI am trying to write a customer HtmlHelper that allows easy creation of an Html Table from a view being passed an codeIEnumerable ltTModelgtcode where TModel is a Model Object Type.

Something like thisp  precodeusing MyNameSpaceToMyHelper model IEnumerableltUsergt       ViewBag.Title  Index  ltpgt  ltpgt  Html.TableHeadersFormodel gt model.AddedUserID foreach var item in Model         Html.TableRowsFormodel gt model.AddedUserID  codepre  pThis should work because codeTableHeadersForcode can call codeDisplayNameExtensions.DisplayNameForcode which takes an codeHtmlHelperltIEnumerableltTModelgtgtcode and codeTableRowsForcode could take an codeHtmlHelperltTModelgtcode and call codeDisplayExtensions.DisplayForcode with an codeHtmlHelperltTModelgtcode so the incompatible HtmlHelper types problem would go away.p  pemstrongHowever I do not ideally want to do this if at all possible as I want the calling syntax to be as simple as possible.  A basic premise of my question is to try and maintain a simple calling syntax without writing a for loop in the view and duplicating the expressions for choosing the columns.  The entire purpose here is to design something reusable and as easy to use for others as possibleemstrongp  pI had a look in ILSpy at how codeDisplayNameExtensions.DisplayNameForcode works as this handles codeHtmlHelperltIEnumerableltTModelgtgtcode as it looks like somehow an exstension method taking an codeHtmlHelperltIEnuermableltTModelgtgtcode is calling internally an extension method on codeHtmlHelperltTModelgtcode but the code ILSpy is producing doesnt even recompile so I getting no where understanding how .Net is able to do this.p  pIs this possible in one extension method or will I be forced to split it compromising the calling syntaxp  pemstrongUPDATE 1emstrong I have managed to get the following working with quite a lot of workp  precodeHtml.BeginTableFormodel gt model.AddedUserID                     , model gt model.Active                     , new  class  grid    foreach var item in Model       Html.DisplayRowFormodel gt item.AddedUserID                         , model gt item.Active   Html.EndTableFor codepre  pIts not as concise as I would like and involves a heap of work especially because each expression to BeginTableFor and DisplayRowFor can return a different type meaning I have basically had to implement a method overload for any number of expressions Ive done up to 100 so will work upto 100 columns.  This is basically the same problem they had in .Net with the Action and Func delegates where they had to write different versions for different numbers of parameters e.g. Action T1, T2,..,T16.  Its obviously extremely messy but I would rather have nice calling syntax than avoid many method overloads.p

However, Im not sure how to get the sprites to play one after another and cant figure out how to do have it continue to animation while the key is pressed.

How would I make an animation play and how would I get it to not jerk around at the beginning when the animation is playing. I am using SFML 2.1 and specific code with an explanation would be greatly appreciated.p

When i save something to GCS, i retrieve a BlobKey withp  precodeBlobKey blobKey  blobstoreService.createGsBlobKeygs  fileName.getBucketName    fileName.getObjectName codepre  pas prescribed a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comappenginedocsjavablobstoreJavaUsingtheBlobstoreAPIwithGoogleCloudStorageherea, and I persist it in the Datastore.p  pSo heres the question the documentation tells me how to serve a GCS file with codeblobstoreService.serveblobKey, respcode in a servlet response, BUT how can I retrieve the file content as InputStream, byte array or whatever to use it in my code for further processing In my current implementation I do that with a codeFileReadChannelcode reading from an codeAppEngineFilecode both deprecated.p

One of these connections will be reserved for a user with  SUPER privileges to allow the administrator to login even if the  connection limit has been reached. maxconnections100   Query cache is used to cache SELECT results and later return them  without actual executing the same query once again. Having the query  cache enabled may result in significant speed improvements, if your  have a lot of identical queries and rarely changing tables. See the  Qcachelowmemprunes status variable to check if the current value  is high enough for your load.  Note In case your tables change very often or if your queries are  textually different every time, the query cache may result in a  slowdown instead of a performance improvement. querycachesize0   The number of open tables for all threads. Increasing this value  increases the number of file descriptors that mysqld requires.  Therefore you have to make sure to set the amount of open files  allowed to at least 4096 in the variable openfileslimit in  section [mysqldsafe] tableopencache2000   Maximum size for internal inmemory temporary tables. If a table  grows larger than this value, it is automatically converted to disk  based table This limitation is for a single table. There can be many  of them. tmptablesize114M tmptablesize1140M   How many threads we should keep in a cache for reuse. When a client  disconnects, the clients threads are put in the cache if there arent  more than threadcachesize threads from before.  This greatly reduces  the amount of thread creations needed if you have a lot of new  connections. Normally this doesnt give a notable performance  improvement if you have a good thread implementation. threadcachesize9   MyISAM Specific options  The maximum size of the temporary file MySQL is allowed to use while  recreating the index during REPAIR, ALTER TABLE or LOAD DATA INFILE.  If the filesize would be bigger than this, the index will be created  through the key cache which is slower. myisammaxsortfilesize100G   If the temporary file used for fast index creation would be bigger  than using the key cache by the amount specified here, then prefer the  key cache method.  This is mainly used to force long character keys in  large tables to use the slower key cache method to create the index. myisamsortbuffersize227M   Size of the Key Buffer, used to cache index blocks for MyISAM tables.  Do not set it larger than 30 of your available memory, as some memory  is also required by the OS to cache rows. Even if youre not using  MyISAM tables, you should still set it to 864M as it will also be  used for internal temporary disk tables. keybuffersize8M   Size of the buffer used for doing full table scans of MyISAM tables.  Allocated per thread, if a full scan is needed. readbuffersize64K readrndbuffersize256K     This buffer is allocated when MySQL needs to rebuild the index in  REPAIR, OPTIMZE, ALTER table statements as well as in LOAD DATA INFILE  into an empty table. It is allocated per thread so be careful with  large settings. sortbuffersize256K    INNODB Specific options   innodbdatahomedir0.0   Use this option if you have a MySQL server with InnoDB support enabled  but you do not plan to use it. This will save memory and disk space  and speed up some things.  skipinnodb   Additional memory pool that is used by InnoDB to store metadata  information.  If InnoDB requires more memory for this purpose it will  start to allocate it from the OS.  As this is fast enough on most  recent operating systems, you normally do not need to change this  value. SHOW INNODB STATUS will display the current amount used. innodbadditionalmempoolsize16M   If set to 1, InnoDB will flush fsync the transaction logs to the  disk at each commit, which offers full ACID behavior. If you are  willing to compromise this safety, and you are running small  transactions, you may set this to 0 or 2 to reduce disk IO to the  logs. Value 0 means that the log is only written to the log file and  the log file flushed to disk approximately once per second. Value 2  means the log is written to the log file at each commit, but the log  file is only flushed to disk approximately once per second. innodbflushlogattrxcommit1    The size of the buffer InnoDB uses for buffering log data. As soon as  it is full, InnoDB will have to flush it to disk. As it is flushed  once per second anyway, it does not make sense to have it very large  even with long transactions. innodblogbuffersize8M    InnoDB, unlike MyISAM, uses a buffer pool to cache both indexes and  row data. The bigger you set this the less disk IO is needed to  access data in tables. On a dedicated database server you may set this  parameter up to 80 of the machine physical memory size. Do not set it  too large, though, because competition of the physical memory may  cause paging in the operating system.  Note that on 32bit systems you  might be limited to 23.5G of user level memory per process, so do not  set it too high. innodbbufferpoolsize735M    Size of each log file in a log group. You should set the combined size  of log files to about 25100 of your buffer pool size to avoid  unneeded buffer pool flush activity on log file overwrite. However,  note that a larger logfile size will increase the time needed for the  recovery process. innodblogfilesize48M   Number of threads allowed inside the InnoDB kernel. The optimal value  depends highly on the application, hardware as well as the OS  scheduler properties. A too high value may lead to thread thrashing. innodbthreadconcurrency17   The increment size in MB for extending the size of an autoextend InnoDB system tablespace file when it becomes full. innodbautoextendincrement64M   The number of regions that the InnoDB buffer pool is divided into.  For systems with buffer pools in the multigigabyte range, dividing the buffer pool into separate instances can improve concurrency,  by reducing contention as different threads read and write to cached pages. innodbbufferpoolinstances8   Determines the number of threads that can enter InnoDB concurrently. innodbconcurrencytickets5000   Specifies how long in milliseconds ms a block inserted into the old sublist must stay there after its first access before  it can be moved to the new sublist. innodboldblockstime1000   It specifies the maximum number of .ibd files that MySQL can keep open at one time. The minimum value is 10. innodbopenfiles300   When this variable is enabled, InnoDB updates statistics during metadata statements. innodbstatsonmetadata0   When innodbfilepertable is enabled the default in 5.6.6 and higher, InnoDB stores the data and indexes for each newly created table  in a separate .ibd file, rather than in the system tablespace. innodbfilepertable1   Use the following list of values 0 for crc32, 1 for strictcrc32, 2 for innodb, 3 for strictinnodb, 4 for none, 5 for strictnone. innodbchecksumalgorithm0   The number of outstanding connection requests MySQL can have.  This option is useful when the main MySQL thread gets many connection requests in a very short time.  It then takes some time although very little for the main thread to check the connection and start a new thread.  The backlog value indicates how many requests can be stacked during this short time before MySQL momentarily  stops answering new requests.  You need to increase this only if you expect a large number of connections in a short period of time. backlog70   If this is set to a nonzero value, all tables are closed every flushtime seconds to free up resources and  synchronize unflushed data to disk.  This option is best used only on systems with minimal resources. flushtime0   The minimum size of the buffer that is used for plain index scans, range index scans, and joins that do not use  indexes and thus perform full table scans. joinbuffersize256K   The maximum size of one packet or any generated or intermediate string, or any parameter sent by the  mysqlstmtsendlongdata C API function. maxallowedpacket4M   If more than this many successive connection requests from a host are interrupted without a successful connection,  the server blocks that host from performing further connections. maxconnecterrors100   Changes the number of file descriptors available to mysqld.  You should try increasing the value of this option if mysqld gives you the error Too many open files. openfileslimit4110   Set the query cache type. 0 for OFF, 1 for ON and 2 for DEMAND. querycachetype0   If you see many sortmergepasses per second in SHOW GLOBAL STATUS output, you can consider increasing the  sortbuffersize value to speed up ORDER BY or GROUP BY operations that cannot be improved with query optimization  or improved indexing. sortbuffersize256K   The number of table definitions from .frm files that can be stored in the definition cache.  If you use a large number of tables, you can create a large table definition cache to speed up opening of tables.  The table definition cache takes less space and does not use file descriptors, unlike the normal table cache.  The minimum and default values are both 400. tabledefinitioncache1400   Specify the maximum size of a rowbased binary log event, in bytes.  Rows are grouped into events smaller than this size if possible. The value should be a multiple of 256. binlogroweventmaxsize8K   If the value of this variable is greater than 0, a replication slave synchronizes its master.info file to disk.  using fdatasync after every syncmasterinfo events. syncmasterinfo10000   If the value of this variable is greater than 0, the MySQL server synchronizes its relay log to disk.  using fdatasync after every syncrelaylog writes to the relay log. syncrelaylog10000   If the value of this variable is greater than 0, a replication slave synchronizes its relaylog.info file to disk.  using fdatasync after every syncrelayloginfo transactions. syncrelayloginfo10000 codepre

Negative 526 pI have a problem with a dynamically generated SQL query. I have a HUGE database where users are stored in different tables. I need to dynamically create a query which will return me the userids based on some restrictions with different partitioning. So far i created a logic which will create me the query based on the restrictions, but I cant figure it out how could I filter the result to have different partitioning.  For examplep  pbI have the followingbp  p1 Malebr 2 Femalebr 3 Age between 1824br 4 Age between 2599br 5 Working at IBMbr Lets say i have 50k female, 50k malep  pNow if my restriction is 1 or 2 and 5, which translates to if its a male or female working at IBM, I generated something like thisp  precodeSELECT DISTINCT userid from usertable1 where age in 0,1  INTERSECT SELECT DISTINCT userid from usertable2 where workplace  IBM codepre  pNow my problem is that this isnt enough, there are times when i have to partition the resulting set of user ids like so  for example that I have 33 male and 66 female in the result list. I dont know how to get it properly. I tried to count how many female and male user I have, then apply a top to them, like sop  precodeSELECT DISTINCT  top 25000 userid from usertable1 where age in 0 UNION  SELECT DISTINCT top 50000  userid from usertable1 where age in 1 SELECT DISTINCT userid from usertable2 where workplace  IBM codepre  pHowever this isnt giving me the right solution, the problem with this is that if I have no female user working at IBM in my list this will return 25k male and 0 female, which is not 33 male and 66 female... p  pNow to complicate it even more, I can have even harder partitioning like so that the result must contain 33 male from which 75amp percent is age between 1824 and 25amp age between 2599 and 66 female from which 75amp percent is age between 1824 and 25amp age p  pbSo my problem is that i have no idea how to solve both of the problem, which can work on huge database, 50k male and 50k female is small compared to the full database. Anyone have any idea for at least one of my problembp  pbEDIT 1b My table has a bit strange structure, its more like a link table. To simplify it and to show my problem, lets consider this example table which has similar format of mine. I have userid, question, questionanswer, age, gender. The same userid appears multiple time as this is only a link table and a user mostly answers for multiple question. The structure of this is by far not optimal i know, but it wasnt designed by me, nor can be modified by me. My task is to get the distinct userids which completes all the restriction and filter the result to have percentage partitioning based on another restriction set. So far I got the correct userids based on the restriction, but i have no idea how can i modify this to be able have percentage partitioning.p  pSo, to be more precise, i have a restriction set which can be something like 1 OR 2 AND 3 AND 4 so on. I create a reverse polish form from this to be able to solve it in order. Based on every restriction for example be male, age between 1824 I create quires which I then concatenate with union or intersect. This work well as long as i dont need to partition it. But unfortunately thats the case and because my result doesnt contain any detail about the answered questions, nor age nor gender only the userid, i have no idea how could i modify it, to be able to filter the result to have the wanted partition sizes by percentage. p

Negative 526   pI hate functions that declare to throw exceptions that are not thrown by this functions in any case. This happens in refactorings if codethrowcode statements are removed in the function body without removing it from the codethrowscode definitions.p  pThats why I activated the setting Java  Compiler  ErrorsWarnings  Unnecessary code  Unnecessary declaration of thrown exception.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comkt1Rj.png altenter image description herep  pThis leads to false positive warnings if exceptions are defined in interfaces or super methods. If implementation A of the interface does not throw one exception type, but implementation B does, eclipse warns about the unnecessary declaration in implemantation A. Thats equally for super and overriden methods. Thats why I activate the suboption Ignore in overriding and implementing methods.p  pPerfeclty fine till here. But I have the oposite case. The overridden method throws a exception type, that is not used in the super method. See this minimal examplep  pre classlangjava prettyprintoverridecodeclass Vehicle      protected int getStatus throws GeneralException, StatusException          throw new GeneralExceptionOne exception type in super type only        class Car extends Vehicle      Override     protected int getStatus throws GeneralException, StatusException          throw new StatusExceptionSpecial case, that gets special handling       codepre  pNow StatusException in Vehicle is warned in eclipse. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comF1ShD.png altenter image description herep  pOf course one could argue that this is bad design etc., but from a pragmatic point of view this will happen again and most probably one can accept to not change the architecture, but to simply add the new exception type to the super type. strongBut howto get rid of the false positive warning in this casestrong Of course one could use the suboption with the javadoc, but this would also ignore most real positive hits. Another option is to add the SuppressWarning annotation unused, but other users could get unneeded warnings for that suppression.p

Resharper suggests to convert the loop to linq expression like thisp  precodesum  array.Sum codepre  pThat code is many times slower than the original loop in Cp  pCould someone tell me if there is something more that I can do to improve the performance of this loop strikewithout compiling it to 64 bit version  which is two times faster.strikep  pAll test where made on 32 bit Release version and run without debugger.p  pEdit  Small correction. 64 bit version is two times faster with doubles, not intsp

Negative 526 pI need to capture 192 kHz audio for some bioacoustics experiments using Python 3. I have the hardware, a Sound Devices USBPre 2 sound card, a microphone with good frequency response curve up to 100 kHz, and I have enabled my os ubuntu 13.04 to sample from this card at 192 kHz.p  pI have tried recording with PyAudio. It appears to work, and will give me a wav file with a sampling rate of 192 kHz. However, when I look at the spectra there is no power above 24 kHz, suggesting that PyAudio doesnt really capture at 192 kHz, but rather at 48 kHz. However, when I record using Audacity with input from JACK, I get a nice recording with power up to 96kHz. So, I have the impression that PyAudio doesnt actually sample the sound at 192 kHz even though it should be able to.

I have tried playing with RewriteBase in .htaccess and that didnt help either.p  pI read that Magento doesnt run on fcgi, so I use in my .htaccess, doesnt help eitherp  precodeOptions ExecCGI addhandler xhttpdphp5cgi .php codepre  pI always end up with No file input specified or cyclic redirect or server error.p  pOnly lines in error log that I see are addedp  precode[Thu Oct 31 012308 2013] [11988011] [negotiationerror] [client 5.178.58.8565433] AH00687 Negotiation discovered files matching request path None could be negotiated. codepre  pBut I dont know what that does mean or how to fix that.p  pSo is there anything else I can try or am I missing something I know Magento on Godaddy shared hosting isnt a good idea, but I need to get there my development running and production will run on my clients Dedicated server.p
Negative 526 pIve got a table that contains data. Tabular data. And it looks like this.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comHo7IW.png altenter image description herep  pSee a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netMrListerc54RNthis fiddlea.p  pNow what Id like is, when its displayed on a narrower screen, for the table to look like this, so that you dont get a horizontal scroll bar and it keeps the same visual structurep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comtkHUd.png altenter image description herep  por if you want, like a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netMrListerc54RN2this fiddlea.p  pNow my question is, how do you do that Id prefer a CSS only way, but so far, I havent managed to do that in only CSS. The second fiddle contains coderowspancode attributes, which dont have CSS equivalents.p  pThe HTML emisem generated server side, so I could generate one of the two layouts depending on the window width, but then it wouldnt respond to a window resize.p  pIm not against a little Javascript, but in this case, to translate the first table into the second on a window resize, it would need to be taken apart and rebuilt, cell by cell, and I think thats overkill. Still looking for a media query that can do all the work.p  pExperimenting a bit, I came a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netMrListerc54RN2this closea, but that doesnt work in IE8 and IE9.p  pSo, does anybody have any ideas how to tackle this The ideal solution would work on table cells of varying height 2 lines of text or more and any number of columns.p

I have a Java Servlet that return a json structure. The servlet is called in a javascript file that have to draw a graph in a web page, building a SVG image. I have to deploy this web app on a commercial Windows server with Tomcat7 installed. The web app generally works. Any errors are displayed from the user point of view. Simply the image doesnt appear if I use that strings I wrote above, to call the servlet. I suppose that the servlet doesnt respond because I use a wrong addressnaming. If I use an absolute url, the servlet responds to the js caller, but I need a relative string, so if the domain name of the server will change, I wont change the code of the js file too.p

And by a standard I mean, in a way that eclipse will find the dependencies for my project, auto complete works and src and javadoc will be available when needed inside the IDE, also that when debuging within Eclipse, the source will be attached to navigate through the breakpoints.p  pPlease dont tell me to use Maven, I have used it already and hate it with passion.p
Negative 526 pHow can I get fonts defined in data uris to appear in Internet Explorer 8p  pHeres the background Im using the tinyMCE HTML editor in a web application, which is being used by several organisations, some of which are using IE which has been set not to allow font downloads. The icons in tinyMCE are implemented as a font, and therefore those people who cant download fonts cant see the icons. Im trying to fix this issue by using the data uri scheme in the skin.min.css, so where it saysp  precodesrcurlfontsicomoon.eot codepre  pIve changed it to sayp  precodesrcurldataapplicationvnd.msfontobjectbase64,TCAAAK...DOJntO codepre  pThis works in IE 9, but it isnt working in IE 8. According to a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiDataURIscheme relnofollowthis wiki pagea data URIs should be allowed in IE8 if theyre less than 32KB and appear where a url is expected in CSS. The font itself is 9KB.p  pUPDATEp  pIve since discovered that data uris are emnotem an adequate solution to the problem of IE being set not to allow font downloads even in version 9. With that setting, web fonts arent used even if they are embedded within the stylesheet. This does make sense from a security point of view, because malicious code could as easily reside in an embedded base64 binary as a separate one. My thinking otherwise resulted from a mixture of wishful thinking, failure to clear the cache, and the fact that the IE security settings in my developer machine were also locked down. So I am going to edit the style sheet to use images instead.p

Negative 526 pI realise that this has been brought up before but I am hoping that someone can clarify something for me. One of my variables is being calculated as a negative number at some point during my model run..however, this is a mistake they can only be positive numbers. So I need to locate where this is happening a trace where the source of error is being produced.p  pThe model is too large to do this manually, so I was hoping to use dbstop in some guise. I realise from reading the posts here that it is not simply a case of giving a condition dbstop in test.m if varlt0 so I was hoping to use a conditional if statement to display an error disp error, which I could use in dbstop in test.m if error. However what I am getting back is Breakpoint expression error resulted in an error. The error was Error usingerror Too many output arguments. Can anyone suggest a way for me to isolate when my variable is becoming negativep

I figure it must be a common problem that the fact model is derivable from resource available outside of drools, so Im wondering if maybe droolsor guvnor has a built in method of generating a fact model given some structured input.p  pI did find some discussion in the following thread a hrefhttpdrools.46999.n3.nabble.comrulesusersUsinganOWLOntologyindroolsadvicetd3724566.html relnofollowhttpdrools.46999.n3.nabble.comrulesusersUsinganOWLOntologyindroolsadvicetd3724566.htmlap  pUnfortunately I wasnt able to get very far following this conversation.p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pThe traits article linked by alikok is very helpful. It at least provides a framework into which an ontology can fit. To summarize, one of the big problems with fitting an ontology into a java bean class model is that java doesnt do multiple inheritance. Almost any ontology will require this, and mine is no exception. Traits solve this with proxy classes, but they do it all in the background by allowing you to define new traits in the drl files. p  pI still have the problem of converting my ontology into a fact model. This is the main issue for this post programmatically generating a fact model so I dont want to check this as answered just yet. I could do it at compile time through a custom program like I describe above. I could also do it at runtime, though for my use case compile time would be much better. Im hoping, however, that someone has already tackled this problem and can offer some insights into what approach they used. p

Negative 526 pI have two applications  mvc web application for users to enter data and a telerik reporting webapi application. These are two separate sites hosted on the IIS. For both these applications, windows authentication is enabled. We created a role manager that would retrieve roles and userID for the current user from sql. I want this logic to be shared across both these applications. Whats the best way to do that p  pDoes it make sense to use a WCF Authentication Service and create a cookie and share that between the two applications If so, could you point me in the direction of that Eventually, I would like for mobile applications we create to also be able to consume the same service. p  pI keep hearing that the webapi should not be in a different application... That it should be hosted by the main mvc application. We need to make sure that a new release of the reports does not force us to release a new version of the main application. There needs to be a separation of these two. Am I thinking through this the wrong wayp  pAny help would be appreciated Thank youp
Negative 526 pI am doing a project where I need to be able to saveload a structural text document like MS word tofrom a table in mysql. p  pFor example, if someone gives me a sample document like sample.doc, I should be able to save the content as well as format into a sql table. Then at another web page, I should be able to load the sample document from the table so end user can start from there. The end user can then modify the sample document and then save it as a real specific document.p  pAnyone has some idea on how this could be achieve with phpjavascripthtmlp  pthanks p  hr  pLet me clarify my question a bit. The requirement is that the user needs to document some notes based on predefined text templates like word templates. This is a webbased application. I want to provide an option for the user to be able to load a certain template, then the user will only modify a few lines of the template and save that specific document. I was initially thinking how to store the template and specific document in sql tables but not sure how to do that. Hope this clarifies. p

Here is how i tried to get the count of decimal placesp  precodei0 whilewert  long intwert  0     wert  10     i  codepre  pBut it gives me the value of 356 decimal places for the example number 2.55. Is there any method wihout using strings to count the decimal placesp  pBest Regardsp
Negative 526 pThis is a question about particular OO implementation in C of the given problemp  pThere are several variants of an algorithm, say two, both of which have some generic parts. These algorithms their implementations, AlgImpl receive startup options. They also receive input data, that they process, piece by piece. There are different ways the startup options can be supplied from file, from network, from user input, as well as there are different ways how the data are received from file, from device. There is a common API for different sources of data, similarly for the options.p  pThe architecture should allow for use of any available AlgImpl together with any available sources of options and data. It should also allow new AlgImpls and possibly new types of sources for options and data to be added with minimum or none changes to the original code with say only two AlgImpls, two option sources types and two data sources types.p  pHere is what I think of it in terms of C, using inheritance, aggregation and pointers. Since all AlgImpls share some common parts, it is naturally to organize them around a base abstract class, so omitting nonessential data types we havep  precodeclass BaseAlgorithm     ...  Abstract class with common code   class SimpleAlgorithmImpl public BaseAlgorithm     ...   class OptimalAlgorithmImpl public BaseAlgorithm     ...  codepre  pNow, the options and data sources have the same interface respectivelyp  precodeclass BaseOptionsSource  public    Interface    virtual void GetOptionsOptionsamp opts  0   class FileOptionsSource public BaseOptionsSource     void GetOptionsOptionsamp opts    ...   class NetworkOptionsSource public BaseOptionsSource     void GetOptionsOptionsamp opts    ...   class BaseDataSource  public    Interface    virtual void GetDataChunkDataChunkamp chunk  0   class FileDataSource public BaseDataSource     void GetDataChunkDataChunkamp chunk    ...   class DeviceDataSource public BaseDataSource     void GetDataChunkDataChunkamp chunk    ...  codepre  pOptions and data sources are then made members of BaseAlgorithmp  precodeclass BaseAlgorithm  public    BaseAlgorithmBaseDataSource pDataSrc, BaseOptionsSource pOptsSrc     BaseDataSource pDataSrc    BaseOptionsSource pOptsSrc   BaseAlgorithmBaseAlgorithmBaseDataSource pDataSrc, BaseOptionsSource pOptsSrc       pDataSrcpDataSrc, pOptsSrcpOptsSrc      codepre  pA partucular algorithm object can then be created as followsp  precodeDeviceDataSource dataSrc NetworkOptionsSource optsSrc SimpleAlgorithmImpl simpleAlgampdataSrc, ampoptsSrc codepre  pFor a new AlgImpl or new type of source, its class should implement inherited methods. Of course, there will have to be an ifelse if... code, that explicitly selects the set of used AlgImpl and sources before AlgImpl object can be created.p  pSource objects can also be reused in this case, provided that AlgImpl object does not manage allocationdeallocation of source objects passed to it.p  pDo you think this is the right way to do it in C Or maybe there exists some other, more simple, more flexible or less problemfree pattern for this kind of interchangeble subfunctionality implementation Is it unavoidable to use pointers in this casep

Please note that these are not handled exceptionsthey are fatal errors from R.p  pThis is just a thoughtand perhaps it is too good to be true, so please at least explain why it wouldnt workbut is there any way to cause R to execute browser in the environment whenever it has a fatal error  For example, say it is executing a script, and encounters requirenotInstalledYet.  Instead of just dying, and losing all the variables in the memory, it would be great if it would give me a browser at the place it died, so that I could at least save the variables, and at best, fix the problem e.g. install the library and try again.p

Negative 526 pI am looking at some c code and I want to find out what union is doing to help translate a byte array into, well a different type such as a word. At least that is what I think is going on. Truly what I want is to figure out the purpose for this code, but I think I understand some of it.p  pMy research has brought me bits and pieces of understanding, but I am not confident that I see the big picture correctly. p  pSo lets say I have a union defined asp  precodetypedef union BYTETOWORD      BYTE b[2]     WORD w     short s  BYTETOWORD codepre  pNote that the byte here is 8 bits and the Word is an unsigned short and both shorts signed and unsigned are 16 bits.p  pthen what happens if in the main code I have a struct....p  precodebyte[] data  someData  struct TWOWORDS      BYTETOWORD word1     BYTETOWORD word2 theWordsIWant  struct TWOWORDSampdata codepre  pI think that the code above takes two bytes of data and put it into word1 and then the next two bytes of data are put into word2. With all the information about unions and structs out there, I cant seem to pin down a serach that explains this code. If I am wrong here, please tell me.p  pSo if I am right about that, then what in word1 or word2 has the value. So my research says that word1 would have a byte array in it, since it can only hold one value.p  pThe translation must be another part of the code that I havent found yet where we do this assuming I could cast the byte to a WORDp  precodetheWordsIWant.w  WORDtheWordsIWant.b codepre  pSo then the bonus question is, why go to all this troubble with the union, when you could simply cast it as a different varriablep  pWORD w  WORDtheWordsIWant.bp  pPerhaps what is really going on is that the code will cast a pointer to anything as one answer here suggests a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2114942howtoconvertfrombytearraytowordarrayincHow to convert from byte array to word array in ca.p  pI am pretty sure I am missing something, either in the motovation for doing this, or the way it works. But then again, maybe I actually understand it after all I dont know. You tell me.p

Negative 526 pIm using valgrind v3.10.0 to hunt down a memory leak in a complex application a heavily modified build of netsnmp that is being built as part of a bigger software suite. I am sure there is a leak the memory footprint of the application grows linearly without bound, but valgrind always reports the following upon termination.p  precode1139 HEAP SUMMARY 1139     in use at exit 0 bytes in 0 blocks 1139   total heap usage 0 allocs, 0 frees, 0 bytes allocated 1139  1139 All heap blocks were freed  no leaks are possible codepre  pThe total heap usage cannot be zero  there are many, many calls to codemalloccode and codefreecode throughout the application. Valgrind is still capable of finding Invalid Write errors.p  pThe application in question is being compiled, along with other software packages, with a uclibcgcc toolchain for the MIPS processor uclibc v0.9.29 to be flashed onto an embedded device running a busybox v1.17.2 linux shell. I am running valgrind directly on the device. I use the following options when launching Valgrindp  precodetoolmemcheck leakcheckfull undefvalueerrorsno tracechildrenyes codepre  pstrongBasically, Valgrind doesnt detect any heap usage even though Ive used the heap.strong Why might this be Are any of my assumptions below wrongp  hr  h2What Ive Triedh2  h3Simple Test Programh3  pI compiled the simple test program using the same target and toolchain as the application above from the Valgrind a hrefhttpvalgrind.orgdocsmanualquickstart.htmlquickstart tutoriala, to see if Valgrind would detect the leak. The final output was the same as above no heap usage.p  h3Linking Issuesh3  pValgrind documentation has the following to say on a hrefhttpvalgrind.orgdocsmanualfaq.htmlfaq.hiddenbugtheir FAQap  blockquote   pIf your program is statically linked, most Valgrind tools will only work well if they are able to replace certain functions, such as malloc, with their own versions. By default, statically linked malloc functions are not replaced. A key indicator of this is if Memcheck says All heap blocks were freed  no leaks are possible.p blockquote  pThe above sounds exactly like my problem, so I checked to see that its dynamically linked to the C libraries that contained codemalloccode and codefreecode. I used the uclibc toolchains custom codelddcode executable a hrefhttpwww.uclibc.orgFAQ.htmllddI cant use the native linux codelddcodea and the output included the following linesp  precodelibc.so.0 gt not found 0x00000000 liblduClibc.so.0 gt liblduClibc.so.0 0x00000000 codepre  pThe reason theyre not found is because Im running this on the x86 host device the mips target device doesnt have an ldd executable. Based on my understanding, codemalloccode and codefreecode will be in one of these libraries, and they seem to be dynamically linked. I also did codereadelfcode and codenmcode on the executable to confirm that the references to codemalloccode and codefreecode are undefined which is characteristic of a dynamically linked executable.p  pAdditionally, I tried launching Valgrind with the codesonamesynonymssomallocNONEcode option as suggested by the FAQ.p  h3LDPRELOAD supporth3  pAs pointed out by commenters and answerers, Valgrind depends upon usage of LDPRELOAD. It has been suggested that my toolchain doesnt support this feature. In order to confirm that it does, I followed a hrefhttprafalcieslak.wordpress.com20130402dynamiclinkertricksusingldpreloadtocheatinjectfeaturesandinvestigateprogramsthis examplea to create a simple test library and load it I replaced coderandcode with a function that just returns 42.

But a NUMBER may still overflow Decimal, giving an invalid cast exception if you try any of the readers .NET type accessors GetValueGetValues, in which case you have to use the readers ODP.NET type accessor GetProviderSpecificValue, which gives you an OracleDecimal, and if it overflows a Decimal, its Value property will give you an overflow exception and your only recourse is to coerce it into a lesser type with one of OracleDecimals ToXxx methods.p  pBut of course the ODP.NET type accessor is not part of the IDataReader interface used by Dapper to hold reader objects, so it seems that Dapper, by itself, is Oracleincompatible when a column type will overflow all .NET types. p  pThe question remains  do the smart folk know how to extend Dapper to handle this. It seems to me Id need an extension point where I could provide implementation on how to use the reader forcing it to use GetDouble instead of GetValue, or casting to OracleDataReader and calling GetProviderSpecificValue for certain POCO property or column types.p

Negative 526 pstrongcodeListViewcode content being added at bottom instead of topstrongp  pIm using codeListViewcode to display a list of data elements. Previously the codeheightcode was set to codewrapcontentcode and it was working fine but with few performance lags. Then I came across a blog saying codeListViewcodes codeheightcode should not be set to codewrapcontentcode for good performance. After doing this, i.e. setting codeheightcode to codefillparentcode, all of my data rows started appearing at bottom of the codeListViewcode instead of top.

Negative 526 pThis is my first post so please forgive me if I break any rules.  p  pI am in the process of writing an app using ADT and the app keeps crashing when I launch one of my activities through a button press. The activity only started giving me trouble when I made one of the buttons within it run a long and complicated piece of Java. I tested the Java in Netbeans prior to porting it over onto the app and it functioned perfectly. When I first added the code to the src files, ADT rejected it because I used a String Switch, which are only compatible in java 1.7 I was compiling with 1.6 and my android device has 4.2.2 which only supports 1.6. After rewriting the code without the string switch, the code compiled using 1.6 Android version 4.3.2 with no errors but once run on the device Android version 4.2.2 Rooted with HyperDrive Rom running the activity that ran the Java caused the app to crash.br What code should I post so someone can look over it and find any errorsp  pEDIT Okay Guys heres the Log Catbr code1026 191927.223 WActivityThread22541 Application com.example.cube can be debugged on port 8100... 1026 191927.603 DlibEGL22541 loaded systemlibegllibEGLadreno200.so 1026 191927.613 DlibEGL22541 loaded systemlibegllibGLESv1CMadreno200.so 1026 191927.643 DlibEGL22541 loaded systemlibegllibGLESv2adreno200.so 1026 191927.653 IAdreno200EGL22541 ltqeglDrvAPIeglInitialize265gt EGL 1.4 QUALCOMM build  CL3579225 1026 191927.653 IAdreno200EGL22541 Build Date 042213 Mon 1026 191927.653 IAdreno200EGL22541 Local Branch adrenosba20130419 1026 191927.653 IAdreno200EGL22541 Remote Branch  1026 191927.653 IAdreno200EGL22541 Local Patches  1026 191927.653 IAdreno200EGL22541 Reconstruct Branch  1026 191927.963 DOpenGLRenderer22541 Enabling debug mode 0 1026 191929.605 DGestureDetector22541 [Surface Touch Event] mSweepDown False, mLRSDCnt  1 mTouchCnt  4 mFalseSizeCnt0 1026 191930.096 ESpannableStringBuilder22541 SPANEXCLUSIVEEXCLUSIVE spans cannot have a zero length 1026 191930.096 ESpannableStringBuilder22541 SPANEXCLUSIVEEXCLUSIVE spans cannot have a zero length 1026 191930.956 DGestureDetector22541 [Surface Touch Event] mSweepDown False, mLRSDCnt  1 mTouchCnt  6 mFalseSizeCnt0 1026 191931.407 ESpannableStringBuilder22541 SPANEXCLUSIVEEXCLUSIVE spans cannot have a zero length 1026 191931.407 ESpannableStringBuilder22541 SPANEXCLUSIVEEXCLUSIVE spans cannot have a zero length 1026 191933.369 DGestureDetector22541 [Surface Touch Event] mSweepDown False, mLRSDCnt  1 mTouchCnt  5 mFalseSizeCnt0 1026 191934.250 ESpannableStringBuilder22541 SPANEXCLUSIVEEXCLUSIVE spans cannot have a zero length 1026 191934.250 ESpannableStringBuilder22541 SPANEXCLUSIVEEXCLUSIVE spans cannot have a zero length 1026 191935.391 DGestureDetector22541 [Surface Touch Event] mSweepDown False, mLRSDCnt  1 mTouchCnt  8 mFalseSizeCnt0 1026 191935.571 DAndroidRuntime22541 Shutting down VM 1026 191935.571 Wdalvikvm22541 threadid1 thread exiting with uncaught exception group0x41b906c0 1026 191935.591 EAndroidRuntime22541 FATAL EXCEPTION main 1026 191935.591 EAndroidRuntime22541 java.lang.RuntimeException Unable to instantiate activity ComponentInfocom.example.cubecom.example.cube.AlgorithmConverter java.lang.NullPointerException 1026 191935.591 EAndroidRuntime22541    at android.app.ActivityThread.performLaunchActivityActivityThread.java2173 1026 191935.591 EAndroidRuntime22541    at android.app.ActivityThread.handleLaunchActivityActivityThread.java2297 1026 191935.591 EAndroidRuntime22541    at android.app.ActivityThread.access700ActivityThread.java152 1026 191935.591 EAndroidRuntime22541    at android.app.ActivityThreadH.handleMessageActivityThread.java1282 1026 191935.591 EAndroidRuntime22541    at android.os.Handler.dispatchMessageHandler.java99 1026 191935.591 EAndroidRuntime22541    at android.os.Looper.loopLooper.java137 1026 191935.591 EAndroidRuntime22541    at android.app.ActivityThread.mainActivityThread.java5328 1026 191935.591 EAndroidRuntime22541    at java.lang.reflect.Method.invokeNativeNative Method 1026 191935.591 EAndroidRuntime22541    at java.lang.reflect.Method.invokeMethod.java511 1026 191935.591 EAndroidRuntime22541    at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInitMethodAndArgsCaller.runZygoteInit.java1102 1026 191935.591 EAndroidRuntime22541    at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit.mainZygoteInit.java869 1026 191935.591 EAndroidRuntime22541    at dalvik.system.NativeStart.mainNative Method 1026 191935.591 EAndroidRuntime22541 Caused by java.lang.NullPointerException 1026 191935.591 EAndroidRuntime22541    at android.app.Activity.findViewByIdActivity.java1886 1026 191935.591 EAndroidRuntime22541    at com.example.cube.AlgorithmConverter.ltinitgtAlgorithmConverter.java15 1026 191935.591 EAndroidRuntime22541    at java.lang.Class.newInstanceImplNative Method 1026 191935.591 EAndroidRuntime22541    at java.lang.Class.newInstanceClass.java1319 1026 191935.591 EAndroidRuntime22541    at android.app.Instrumentation.newActivityInstrumentation.java1071 1026 191935.591 EAndroidRuntime22541    at android.app.ActivityThread.performLaunchActivityActivityThread.java2164 1026 191935.591 EAndroidRuntime22541    ... 11 more codebr Im sure the XML is sound but the java is lengthy and hard to understand even with comments so Im hesitant to post it.br Please Helpbr strongThanks a Lotstrongp

I have successfully builded this XML Schema myself but now I came to my limit of experience with it.

While iterating we save the codesrccode value of each codegroupcode in a temporary variable so that we can check in the next codegroupcode if the src is the same. If so, we need to iterate over all steps of this group and the steps of the previous group. Is is only valid that the first codestepcode codestartcode elements of the second group is greater than the codestepcode codestartcode point of the first group.li liIf the codevariantcode has the value 1 or 2, then it is again necessary to loop over all groups  group and the nested codestepcode elements. Each codestartcode element of a codestepcode element must be greater than the previous codestepcode codestartcode. So if there is a codestepcode with attribute codenumber1code and the codestartcode element of it has the value 3 than the next step with the codenumber2code can only have a codestartcode codegt3code. This is necessary to check.li ol

Negative 526 pI am trying to calculate height of UITableViewCells. I have this working creating a prototype cell instance from a dynamic prototype configured in the storyboard by calling dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier on the UITableView and then calling systemLayoutSizeFittingSize on the cell prototype. The problem is that the traitCollection and the constraints configured in the storyboard for the cell are always what I have set for AnyAny and the frame of the cell is always 320pt wide. This seems wrong. Is there something Im missing Is there some other way I should be laying out the cells to use size classes and instantiating them Cells created using dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifierforIndexPath have the correct traitCollection and constraint values, but I obviously cant use that to create a prototype cell to calculate cell height as it triggers a call to tableViewheightForRowAtIndexPath.p

Negative 526 pMy goal is to find the brightness of every pixel in an image and then append it into an array. I have looked online since this is way outside of my comfort zone, but I figured thats how Ill learn, and found several examples that get the pixel colors in Swift for IOS using UIImage. Unfortunately the same code cant be used for OS X since NSImage doesnt seem to convert to CGImage the same way a UIImage does. So that code became next to useless for me. Next I found a hrefhttpwww.raywenderlich.com69855imageprocessinginiospart1rawbitmapmodification relnofollowthis sitea, which offers a piece of example code that finds and logs the brightness of each pixel in an image. Bingo The only problem is it is in Objective C, which I only slightly understand. After a bit more failed searches, I began attempting to translate the Objective C code.

Negative 526 pIs there anyway to declare variables immune to clear all in MatLab One solution I thought of was saving the variables and reopening them whenever I need them. Can anyone think of a more elegant solution Thanksp  pEDIT Let me explain my problem a bit more thouroughly, which I should have done in the first place sorry for that.p  pI have to run a few routines using some black box intermediate code some of which may be mex files. It would be good to assume that I cannot dwell into these codes. I could alter some of them, but that would be costly for example, I dont know where the clear all is happening. I know I may be asking for too much, but you never know. Thanks for the answers so far.p
Negative 526 pI recently made a system that ranks each players depending on their points. Well the way the system gets the points is rather confusing. After using this system for over 24 hours, I have found out that it is not organizing it according to the points. But then it suddenly occurred to me, that I could be calculating the points wrong in a way that does not represent the SQL query. Here is my SQL query that my rankings usesp  precodeSELECT  , playeruid AS playerid,       SELECT COALESCEsumplayer1points,0      FROM  mybbmatches      WHERE player1uid  playerid AND gid  id AND timestamp lt time AND winneruid is NOT NULL AND dispute  3        SELECT COALESCEsumplayer2points,0      FROM  mybbmatches      WHERE player2uid  playerid AND gid  id AND timestamp lt time AND winneruid is NOT NULL AND dispute  3        SELECT SUM rank       FROM  mybbmatchesgame      WHERE playeruid  playerid AND gid  id     AS points  FROM mybbmatchesgame WHERE gid  id  ORDER BY points DESC codepre  pNow that this is shown, I was wondering if theres any way to grab the value of points and display it somehow so I can verify the number. Is this possiblep

Negative 526 pI have been working in Visual Studio for a while now and have come to love intellisense. The one thing that has come to mind every now and again is if it would be possible to add in comments to properties of custom objects just like you can with Subs amp Functions.p  pFor example this is an object I defined in an application Im currently working onp  precodeltSerializablegt ltXml.Serialization.XmlRootRelObjgt Public Class RelObj  ltXml.Serialization.XmlElementgt Public Property TableA As String   ltXml.Serialization.XmlElementgt Public Property TableB As String   ltXml.Serialization.XmlElementgt Public Property Key1 As String   ltXml.Serialization.XmlElementgt Public Property Key2 As String   ltXml.Serialization.XmlElementgt Public Property Key3 As String    End Class codepre  pSo Im currious if theres a way to do the equivalent of typing codecode before a subfunction and be able to define text to appear in the Intellisense comment whenever I utilize this object type. That way, if I were say trying to reference a RelObj I could have Intellisense remind me that TableA is supposed to be equivalent to the codeNamecode Property of the TblObj that holds the RelObj, while TableB is the table being related to.p  pIf not, its not like I havent gotten by without it thus far, but it would be nifty and a way to avoid mistakes.p

Negative 526 pI am trying to boot my raspberry pi and the first light is green, the second red and the other ones are not on. It was working fine until I unplugged the SD Card from the pi and plugged it in windows, then i deleted the config.txt file.p  pI tried to put SD card in the pi again but it just doesnt boot, noting happens except the two lights I talked about. I took another raspberry pi and another SD card and installed a raspbian image like on the first one. Everything is working on this second SD card and raspberry pi so I copied the boot folder from this one into the boot folder of the other one.p  pNow both of them are not working  I would like to get the first pi to boot without reinstalling everything because a lot of stuff was configured, do you have any ideas p  pMaybe reinstalling the image on the first pi but before that saving the entire pi folder, then after reinstalling copying it back would work p  pThank you for your time and expertise.p

From what I was able to find on the internet, I compiled my project by Google  GWT Compile and then placed the WAR directory contents into my website directory at GoDaddy.com which is where my website is hosted.

Negative 526 pOur Web application has a very rich Javascript frontend, with a large number of custom widgets, wizards etc. Were looking at migrating some of it perhaps eventually all to TypeScript primarily for the benefits of easier refactoringfewer bugs.p  pWeve got JavaScript unit tests for widgetsclientside business logic  which we run through Karma. Currently our assertions all use the YUI test framework but were not especially attached to that.p  pSince were moving the codebase to TypeScript, it seems reasonable to consider writing some of the fixtures in TypeScript too for the same benefits. Also note that the JavaScript output from our TypeScript code isnt quite as friendly as our handtooled JavaScript code, so thats another reason to want to write the tests against the TypeScript.p  pCurrently, some of our unit tests will monkeypatch a dependency to interrogate the code under test. For example, we might replace the browsers XmlHttpRequest object with a mock object so that we can reason about how our code interacts with the emrealem XmlHttpRequest object. p  pWe currently do that by just replacing the dependency for the duration of the test e.g. codewindow.XmlHttpRequest  MyMockObjectcodep  pDoes anyone have any thoughts on this practice, and in particular, thoughts on how achieving it in TypeScript differs from JavaScriptp  pNote that Im not a fan of modifying our code for the sole purpose of making it easier to unit test e.g. requiring the dependency is always injected rather than assumed to exist.p

Negative 526 pLets say I want to write an intrusive list. I have an intrusive list class template that takes the type and a pointer to the member to use as the node. It looks roughly like thisp  precode This needs to be a member of anything the intrusive list is going to store. class IntrusiveListNode       ...    The intrusive list itself template ltclass T, IntrusiveListNode TMembergt class IntrusiveList       ...    This is a type that is going to be stored in an intrusive list. class IntegerListNode  public     IntrusiveListNode node  private     int value    An example of the how the list would be used. IntrusiveListltIntegerListNode, ampIntegerListNodenodegt myList codepre  pEach thing you want to store in the list has an IntrusiveListNode on it. To turn that IntrusiveListNode back into a thing you can use, like an IntegerListNode, you call a function which does some pointer arithmetic on the node based on its offset in the class, then casts it to the appropriate type. This seems to work, but I think its not guaranteed to.p  pId like to be able to add a staticassert to my class that verifies at compile time that the type youre using is safe, but Im not sure what the staticasserts condition would be. I emthinkem this is only guaranteed to work if the type holding the IntrusiveListNode is a standard layout class, but Im not sure since the requirements for standard layout types seem stricter than I actually need. p  pIn particular, a standard layout type requires that all members have the same access control. What I need is to just be able to make sure pointer arithmetic will work. That would mean you couldnt use this on a polymorphic type because two different versions of the struct could be laid out differently, but this shouldnt be an issue if the type has some mix of private and public data members, right Would it be safe if I just required that the type be nonpolymorphic Or is there a better check to do Or am I stuck doing an codeisstandardlayoutcode checkp

Negative 526 pI created an SKEmitterNode to attach to my player after he dies. Its a very simple smoke one.  The problem is, it is crashing the game when I eitherp  p1 Hit the retry button and transition to the same scene, it will, at a random time, crash the game with an EXCBADACCESS error.p  p2 Return to the home screen and hit play and transition to that game scene after dying at least once and creating the emitter node.p  pCurrently the SKEmitterNode is a class variable optional. When the player dies, they set up the SKEmitterNode and attaches it to the scene.p  precode     Add death smoke     let smokePath String  NSBundle.mainBundle.pathForResourceplayerDeathSmoke, ofType sks     self.deathSmokeEmitter  NSKeyedUnarchiver.unarchiveObjectWithFilesmokePath as SKEmitterNode     self.deathSmokeEmitter.name  deathSmokeEmitter     if let deathEmitter  self.deathSmokeEmitter          deathEmitter.targetNode  self.scene         self.addChilddeathEmitter      codepre  pself.addChilddeathEmitter will cause the crash AFTER you reload the scene the smoke DOES appear. This is the SAME way the example code in the SKEmitterNode documentation adds the emitter node.p  pI also tried various things to fix it already like overriding the removeFromParent method on the Player sprite and running removeFromParent on it myself before transitioning scenes.p  precode    override func removeFromParent           self.deathSmokeEmitter.removeFromParent          self.deathSmokeEmitter.targetNode  nil           super.removeFromParent       codepre  pAfter doing this the crash will only occur when RETURNING to the home screen first and then transitioning back to the game scene. That means I can do quick retries over and over again as many times as I want if that is commented out, but it still crashes if I go back to the home scene and return to the game scene. Also, when it crashes this way, the stack trace shows this last method before crashingp  precode [SKEffectNode dealloc] codepre  pPlease let me know if you have any ideas and thanksp  pPS I do nothing strange during my transitions. I simply instantiate a transition and push the next scene. I was relying on SpriteKit to take care of all the cleaning for me.p

Negative 526 pFirst thing I am running Mac Excel 2011. I dont love it as much as the PC 2013, but it works. That is important because the standard FormulaBar VBA code for 2013 doesnt work in 2011. Instead you have to usep  precodeApplication.CommandBarsWorksheet Menu Bar.FindControlID849, RecursiveTrue.Execute codepre  pBut its pure a toggle switch.  So that means you have to start with the bar on or off, measure the visible Range, toggle it to the other way, measure again, and then decide based on the two sizes if you want to turn it back the way it was originally, or leave it. Then you make two blocks of code, differentiated by one having lt and the other having , and youve got toggle switches. p  pCredit for Formula Bar HidingUnhiding adapted Ron DeBruin a hrefhttpanswers.microsoft.comenusmacforummacoffice2011macexcelusingvbahowcaniascertainifformulabaris5143c9df36554a57a6bb76e545902274 relnofollowhttpanswers.microsoft.comenusmacforummacoffice2011macexcelusingvbahowcaniascertainifformulabaris5143c9df36554a57a6bb76e545902274ap  pSituation I have a workbook that I am using much like an Excel App. Its primary restriction of user actions is that it cleans up the display for the workbook by hiding all Excel Menus at open. p  pThe problem I have run into is that when the workbook closes, I need it to unhide everything I hid so when I just want to use regular old Excel, everthing shows. Everything is unhiding when I close the workbook except for unhiding the formula bar. When I use a macro button in the workbook with the exact same code as below, I can hide and unhide everything perfectly all day long, no problem. But when the workbook closes, it will unhide everything EXCEPT for the Formula bar.  I thought that I had isolated the problem to the code line above, but.... the one anomaly to the glitch is when I went to put the code into a new workbook to share with everyone here, I worked the first time. Then quit working after that. So what am I missing that will make it work when closing  Thanks in advancep  precodePrivate Sub WorkbookOpen Application.ScreenUpdating  False  Dim

Negative 526 pGood dayp  pI just started using Corona and Im kinda confused with this x and y properties. Is it possible to perhaps get the x and y values using Top, Left, Width and Height properties if these are provided For example, I want an an object to be at Left10, Top0,Width40 and Height40. Can someone please advise how I can do this, this could be for images, text, textfield etcp
Negative 526 pemUpdateem We told users to register on a coworkers computer and, so far, that is fixing the problem. We had expected the problem to be in their combination of data so we examined the database. Since it worked on another computer that, supposedly, had the same configuration, we are stumped again. These computers are tightly controlled by their IT Departments and should have the exact same restrictions because the users have the same roles. Does anybody have any idea which userconfigurable setting in IE 9 or 11 could cause this problemp  pemOriginal Textem Our ASP MVC 5 model has several required fields but two have a problem. For 3 of users, the values of these fields are NULL in the posts for the AJAX calls and the submit post. p  pThe users selection from the strongServicestrong dropdown makes an AJAX call with the ID of the strongServicestrong selection to populate the strongRegionstrong dropdown. For hundreds of users, the IIS logs and database tracing show the call goes through with the correct parameter. They see the correctly filtered list. However, for a few users, the parameter is null and the call returns an unfiltered list of all regions. We see the null parameter in the DB tracing. p  pThe users selection from the strongRegionstrong dropdown makes an AJAX call with the IDs of the strongServicestrong and strongRegionstrong selection to populate the strongLocationstrong dropdown. For hundreds of users, the IIS logs and database tracing show the call goes through with the correct parameter. They see the correctly filtered list. However, for a few users, the parameter is null and the call returns an unfiltered list of all strongLocationsstrong. We see the null parameter in the DB tracing. p  pThe few users with the problem scroll through the dropdowns to pick the valid combination of strongRolestrong, strongServicestrong, strongRegionstrong, and strongLocationstrong. Then they click submit and, once again, the strongServicestrong and strongRegionstrong selections are missing from the values in the post. Those two selections are NULL so the [Required] attribute on the model keeps the user on the same page with a nagging message to Enter a Service and Enter a Region. For these few users, Region and Service are always null for AJAX posts or the submission post. The other fields are fine.p  pAll users are on IE11. Other users in the same office do not have the problem.

As a result Im presuming that theres something wrong with my MakePinArray template function so that the compiler is ignoring the constexpr specifier, and allowing it to be called at runtime hence the undefined reference error. p  pHowever, Ive looked at other answers such as the second suggestion in this answer a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions19019252c11create0tonconstexprarrayinc1902131519021315c11 Create 0 to N constexpr array in ca and cant detect a functional difference between his buildarray function and mine. p  pCan anybody a confirm that my understanding is correct ie that constexpr specifier is being discarded, causing there to be a declaration for RowPins but no definition and b suggest how I rectify thisp  pJust for further information if it is helpful, Im using VisualGDBarmgcc 4.9.2 and compiling with codestdc11code .p

Negative 526 pIm using Streaming API to track a specific user to get all the tweets and retweets.

However, if user C sees anything interesting from Bs timeline and click retweet, streaming cannot capture that. p  pI tried using codestatusesretweetscode API to with the id of the tweet that B retweeted from As tweet and it comes up as empty.

Negative 526 pIm trying to refine my projects use of MVC by implementing a MVC Model in my ViewControllers.  This also means Id like to maintain a more centralized Model to represent data. p  pOne issue Im running into is that when using a subviewController I pass the model downward.  This is okay if things are readonly, but Im running into an issue when the subViewController wishes to update the model, and the parents instance becomes outdated.  Then popping and pushing causes the outdated version to get pushed down, and havoc occurs, etc.p  pSome ideas Ive had, some worse than othersp  p1 Use a central model object, [EventDataManager sharedInstance].eventModel, that anyone who readswrites accesses.  This gets cumbersome to write out for every use though.p  p2 Maintain a reference to parent VC, and pass back the changes made in a subVC.  This gets tangled though, and doesnt feel like good code.p  p3 Implement a KVO system that attempts to monitor the subVCs model, and update the parents instance if changes occur. Not working well yet.p  pstrongIm wondering if anyone has suggestions on proper ways to maintain a common MVC model, as well as ideas about propagating changes throughout the views when an update is madestrong  KVO is already proving messy, and Im keen about other notification methods, etc. There may be several other views that share the same model info as well.p  pHere is some code that illustrates the use problem, with the kvo idea also.

Negative 526 pWe have an codeSSIScode project that reads from a text file and inserts to a codesql servercode table.p  pThe codeFlat File Connection Managercode for the codeFlat File Sourcecode uses a variable value as codeConnectionStringcode property. So essentially, its emexpressionem codeConnectionString  [UserFileName]code. This is working fine, and its reading the file from the variable into the table.p  pSince the filename needs to be saved into the table, we need to also insert the filename into the table thats already storing the contents of the actual file. Currently, each line in our text file has 5 commaseparated value that we read into table code[TableFile]code, which also has 5 columns.p  pThe change would be that code[TableFile]code will now have an additional column code[FileName]code. Therefore, the codeData Flow Taskcode that runs and inserts the contents of the file will also insert the filename already saved in variable code[UserFileName]code.p  pSince the table will always have one filename, I was thinking of somehow using an codeExecute Sql Server Taskcode item to update the table with this value. But I have no idea of how to include the value of code[UserFileName]code in the codeSQL UPDATEcode statement.p  pThanks.p

Negative 526 pThe Background. So one of my teams has built a desktop application installer and all. It runs and will open up different processes depending on the function it happens to be using at the time. p  pThe problem.  When we open Well call it Jim.exe it runs smoothly. Different parts of Jim will open up additional Jim.exes depending on which parts its using. This directly is not the problem. p  pThe problem is that not all of those additional processes close when you exit the application. This is admittedly an oversight in Development but the fellow who designed that process no longer works on the project.p  pOriginal Attempted Solution.  I have been tasked with finding a way to close those rogue processes. I did get some assistance using VBS to search and destroy these processes. Using the below p  pKill.vbsp  precode    strComputer  .     Set objWMIService  GetObjectwinmgmts       amp impersonationLevelimpersonate amp strComputer amp rootcimv2     Set colProcessList  objWMIService.ExecQuery       SELECT  FROM Win32Process WHERE Name  Jim.exe     For Each objProcess in colProcessList      objProcess.Terminate     Next codepre  pHowever I could not find a way to attach it to a close event of any kind so I came up with a .bat to start the exe and contain it until it closes thus triggering the kill.vbs p  pBox.bat Box.exep  precode    CProgram FilesJim FolderJim.exe      Call CProgram FilesJim FolderKill.vbs codepre  pI converted the above .Bat into an exe of its own so the user can use the shortcut to this Box.exe to 1. open the actual exe. 2. wait for the application to close 3. trigger Kill.vbs. p  pWorks perfect  But I cant use it ...  The Box.exe is immediately flagged by AV and eaten ... You can probably guess why. p  pMy Question To You.  Is there possibly another way of arranging this so AV does not eat my .Exe Or a different way to script that will close rogue processes once the application is closed. I am sure there are multiple ways to resolve this problem but I am drawing a blank. It doesnt have to be a vbs or .bat necessarily any script or code will do if I can pick apart what makes it work.  p  pThe Goal.  A way to kill Rogue processes not closed by the application. p  pp.s. I used Bat2Exe to convert Box.bat to Box.exe p  pI really hope this is clear enough to understand let me know if you need more information. Also it will be user facing so I cant have terminal windows opening when it is launched and I cant have AV quarantining it.p

Negative 526 pI must implement mechanism for SSO authentication based on SAML provider in A app and redirect to another application B app if the authentication is successeful. In the redirect I must include SAMLAssertion xml document lets say encoded in base64 so I can authenticate in the another application B app.p  pA app is Spring boot application with simple form for credentials. On form submit there is a REST call to SAML Idp and resposne is consumed. If the response is successful I am executing redirect to B app. HERE I would like to include response from Idp.p  pB app is complex Java application with own users database where I can implement custom authenticators based on HTTPServletRequests so I can consume both GET and POST requests.

Negative 526 pI am using IIS 7 and I have an Web Site called MySite. Within this site I have 3 Applications Admin, Biz, Public. For these sites Im using ASP.NET 4.5. Within the Admin site the user has the ability to upload images. After the upload is complete, the images are resized and stored on the file system.p  pWhat I would like to do is move these images over to the Application called Public. Is there a common and accepted practice for doing thisp  pAlso, I should note that the Admin and Biz sites are fully secured, so I cant just create an URL that points to the path within the Admin.p
