Positive 824 pI have a fairly simple question regarding assembly language. We are using SICXE architecture which is basically make believe and for educational purposes only, but does follow the common conventions of other architectures.

What is the difference between the following two sequences of statementsp  precodeA. LDA ALPHABETA  B. LDA ALPHA     SUB BETA codepre  pJust for clarity, LDA loads data into register A, which is used for arithmetic operations. And an operation like SUB, as seen here, or ADD, works on register A by default without having to declare it.p  pNow, at first glance, I am assuming both A and B are equivalent. My logic is pretty straightforward. Load into A the difference of ALPHA and BETA, or alternatively load into A, ALPHA, then subtract from ALPHA in register A, BETA. Which seems to me accomplishes the same exact thing Am i missing some trivial detail or is it really as simple as it looks p

If i stop using calls but merely lea ebx,[eip5], push ebx, jmp xxxxxx instead it works fine.p  pSo in my case and to be a little more concrete function 2 is defined like this  p  precode    void test   asm f01758630    lt Procedure Start      PUSH EBP             MOV EBP, ESP             PUSH ESI             PUSH EDI             mov edi, [ebp  0x0C]             XOR ESI, ESI             SHR EDI, 0x2             TEST EDI, EDI             JLE f0175866B             PUSH EBX             mov ebx, [ebp  0x08]      f01758645          MOV EDX, DWORD PTR DS  [EBX  ESI  0x4]             ROL EDX, 0x10             MOV ECX, EDX             MOV EAX, EDX             SHR ECX, 0x8             SHL EAX, 0x8             XOR ECX, EAX             SHL EDX, 0x8             AND ECX, 0xFF00FF             XOR ECX, EDX             MOV DWORD PTR DS  [EBX  ESI  0x4], ECX             INC ESI             CMP ESI, EDI             JL TERA01758645             POP EBX          f0175866B           POP EDI             POP ESI             POP EBP             RETN lt Procedure End   codepre  pHowever when i debug the running program I can see the function is implemented like this  p  precodepush ebx push esi push edi push ebp mov ebp,esp push esi push edi codepre  pIe msvc implemented 3 pushs, is that maybe related to asm which is within the function any insight to how I can fix this p

Negative 824 pGood morning,p  pI am working on a C winform application that is using validation for the controls. The issue Im having is that when a user clicks into a textbox and attempts to click out, the validation fires and refocuses the control, basically the user cannot click out of the control to another control.p  pMy desired result is to have ALL of the controls on the form validate when the user clicks the submit button. I would like to have the errorProvider icon appear next to the fields that are in error and allow the user to correct them as they see fit.p  pMy question is, how do I setup a control to allow a user to click outside of it when there is an error. Id like the user to have the ability to fill in the rest of the form and come back to the error on their own instead of being forced to deal with it immediately.p  pThank you in advance for any help and advice,p

Negative 824 pIve got a fairly big XML file that I need to parse into a .NET class structure to be mapped to a fixedlength record format and transmitted via MQ. Performance is important, but not absolutely critical. p  pI almost always use codeXPathNavigatorcode to read XML files because its much easier than codeXmlReadercode. On the other hand, I know codeXmlReadercode is faster than codeXPathNavigatorcode, because it theoretically just reads one node at a time whereas codeXPathNavigatorcode has to read enough to execute an XPath, possibly the whole document. p  pMy question is how much faster is it really Will it make a noticeable difference when reading a few thousand nodes Whats the tipping point where I pretty much have to switch to codeXmlReadercode Or is codeXPathNavigatorcode optimized to the point that its always a good optionp  pMost of my XML experience is on relatively small files, so Im looking for input from anybody whos worked with big files.p

Negative 824 pIm working with dependency injection DI from now on to resolve components and am looking for an elegant solution to loading dependent assemblies in a .NET environment.

And even a reference to assembly A wouldnt be enough because I somehow need to ensure that A, B and C all end up in my output directory.p  pSo, some obvious solutions are tobr  add references to A, B and C from the executing application Requires knowledge of the dependency structure which, in my case, is extremely complex, making this a somewhat undesired solution.br  add these dlls to the GAC Just not an option in my case.  p  pbr So Im wondering if anyone has an elegant solution to this issue.

Only the codeIDcode and codeNamecode attributes of the posted person is bound and I manually set the codeFriendcode property. This involves getting the codeFriendcode from my repository using the codefriendidcode to make it a real Person object.li liChecking the ModelState and removing errors I know dont count. This is just plain wrong and nonscalable have to remember to do this if I add for example a codeSecondFriendcode propertyli ol  pI feel option 2 is the most feasable, but ideally Id like it to be automatic. In addition, I cant use the strongly typed helper, as the codefriendidcode textbox codenamecode attribute must match the action methods parameter name.p  pI feel theres some point Ive missed that would make this easier. Hopefully Im right. Although I think its a bit tedious using a ViewModel, it thats the correct thing to do, please do tell.p  pemEditemp  pFor now solved the problem using ViewModels with codeIDcode, codeNamecode and codeFriendidcode as its properties and the same validation attributes as the codePersoncode model. I then map the codeIDcode and codeNamecode values over to a new codePersoncode instance. The Friend property is then set by loadning the specified friend from the repository.

Negative 824 pI have a Lock wait timeout exceeded error from MySQL that I cant reproduce or diagnose.  Im sure its deadlock as opposed to a transaction grabbing a lock then twiddling its thumbs, because my logs show that another process started at the same time, also hung, then continued when the first timed out.  But normally, InnoDB detects deadlocks without timing out.  So I am trying to understand why this deadlock was not detected.p  pBoth transactions are using isolation level serializable.  I have a fair understanding of InnoDB locking in this isolation level.  There is one nonInnoDB MyISAM table used in the transaction, which I insert into and update.  However, I dont understand how it could be involved in the deadlock, because I believe MyISAM just takes a table lock during the inserts and updates then immediately releases it since MyISAM is not transactional, so no other lock is taken while this table lock is held.p  pSo Im convinced that the deadlock involves only InnoDB tables, which brings me back to the question of why it was not detected.  The MySQL documentation httpdev.mysql.comdocrefman5.1eninnodbdeadlockdetection.html implies that deadlock detection pretty much always works.  The problem cases I found while searching involve things like explicit lock table, alter table, and insert delayed.  Im not doing any of these things, just inserts, updates, and selects some of my selects are for update.p  pI tried to reproduce by creating one MyISAM table and a couple InnoDB tables and doing various sequences of insert and update into MyISAM, and select for updates in InnoDB.  But every time I produced a deadlock, InnoDB reported it immediately.  I could not reproduce a timeout.p  pAny other tips for diagnosing this  I am using mysql 5.1.49.p

Negative 824 pIm not a pro with regexp and especially in this specific context. Any idea how to use a function to do a RegExp Replace and then calling it from the query in Microsoft Access p  pBy the way, this query oddly enough doesnt work fully and maybe its why this could use regexp.p  pThe idea is to match the three fields in the temptable queryp  precodelastname  firstname  middleinitial Blair      Sheron      S Brown      Wanda       R Rodriguez  Lillian     M Glaubman   Alan         codepre  pwith what is in either names1 or names2 field in printreadyp  precodeBLAIR,SHERON S BROWN,BRENON I HE BROWN,WANDA R  RODRIGUEZ,LILLIAN M GLAUBMAN,ALAN amp SHORSTEIN,LILLIAN  codepre  pFor some strange reason, my query fails to return the four names above, even though they are obviously in the temptable, as shown above. The trick though is that names1 and names2 will have more names than what I need as shown in the second item in the list above so I must use Like. And if theres a value in middleinitial column, then I need to check printready for that middle initial as well, otherwise I dont check for middleinitial. This ensures if theres a middle initial, it doesntt return records with first and last name similarities, but only returns the record with the initial as well.p  pAnd it still gives me user type undefined for  colMatches As MatchCollection p  precodePublic Function NameMatchByVal pLast As String, ByVal pFirst As String, ByVal pMiddle As Variant, ByVal pSearchField As String As Boolean   Dim strReturn As String   Dim colMatches As MatchCollection Dim RetStr As String Dim objRegExp As RegExp  strReturn  s[pLast]s,[pFirst]     If LenpMiddle gt 0 Then     strReturn  s[pLast]s,[pFirst][spMiddle] End If  Set objRegExp  New RegExp objRegExp.pattern  strReturn objRegExp.IgnoreCase  True objRegExp.Global  True  If objRegExp.TestpSearchField  True Then Set colMatches  objRegExp.ExecutepSearchField  For Each match In colMatches     record  match.Value Next  NameString  record  End If  End Function  SELECT t.lastname, t.firstname, t.middleinitial, p.names1, p.names2 FROM tempquery AS t, printready AS p WHERE  NameMatcht.lastname, t.firstname, t.middleinitial, p.names1  True  Or NameMatcht.lastname, t.firstname, t.middleinitial, p.names2  True And p.usstatesandcanada In FL, NY codepre

Negative 824 pIm still using Subsonic 2 for a few of my projects.  Wanting to hack it a little. Ive got the latest pull from the GIT repo, Im using VS2008 Pro.p  pLooking in the SubSonic.Test project, the mbUnit dll referenced has a description of MbUnit.Framework 2.4.197, though the file version is 1.0.2700.29885. So I assume were working with mbUnit 2.4.p  pI can compile the project fine, but I cant get Gallio to recognise the tests in  SubSonic.TestsbinDebugSubSonic.Tests.dll It just comes up with no tests found.p  pI have spent several hours trying to find docco on the net for this scenario, but theres not really any.  Im also not keen on modifying the existing project as it gets further out of step with the GIT origin.

Its now a version of VS later now and I would likely have lost the config in the upgrade. Im hoping to find someone out there who has the SubSonic v2.1 unit testing working and ask emhow are you running the tests emp  pEdit I contacted Rob Conery in the end and he confirmed with some dismay that TD .NET is no longer running the mbUnit 1 tests.  He thinks around td.net 1.3 was used when SubSonic 2 was in active development, but I cant find any historical downloads of that version.p  pThat leaves resharper, which I havent tested.p  pIf I decide to upgrade the test framework to mbUnit 3, then Ill post it to GutHub.p  pThanks Yann for comments  Ive selected you as answerer.p  pUPDATE Subsonic 2 Github sources were upgraded to mbUnit 3 around june 2011p

All of the videos play perfectly fine when stored on the SD card.

Failures will bubble up back through the service layer into the controller and out into the view.p  pBut for this simple scenario I am stuck as to the best solution for the call stack  and have that tested well, since this validation needs to call the db to check all other usernames.p  pFor me, this is still a validation concern of the User model.

Negative 824 pI have a Flash 10 program that locks up when running on a device, such as a netbook, that has a weak processor. Specifically, it goes into a state where it is doing very heavy processing within an ENTERFRAME event handler following a mouse down event, and expects to stop doing this processing following a mouse up event. The problem is that, since there is no idle time left over following the frame event handlers, the mouse up event is never received, and consequently the process locks up in what amounts to an infinite loop. Yes I can do things like lower the frame rate and do what I can to reduce the processing taking place in each frame, but is there some iron clad way to break out of this Is there some way to detect that no idle time exists Or is there a way to force receipt of the interactive mouse events Or could I, within the ENTERFRAME code, detect the state of the mouse, up or down, without getting a mouse eventp

Negative 824 pI have a question concerning dependency injection. I have been keeping it simple so far, my methodology is basically to factor out object creation within objects and passing it instead in the constructer. I have come to a point where I am attacking larger classes that  require multiple oblects. Some even have objects that contain other objects, with merry little singletons here and there.  It gets ugly fast when testing these classes, as they are far from isolated they are still hardcoded to their dependencies.p  pSo. Injecting an object or 2 for a trivial class is straightforward, p  pI have looked into dependency containers,  saw many implementations and am now wondering what is the advantage of using container vs. a registry for example. Couldnt one just as easily use a registry to hold anonymous functions that create the needed dependencies when called upon p  pThe 2 containers I peeked into,  a hrefhttpwww.potstuck.com relnofollowPhp Dependencya and a hrefhttpsgithub.comfabpotPimple relnofollowPimplea  differ greatly in the implementation. p  pI am wondering on the advantages of user a container vs. passing straight objects. I fail to understand how phpdependencys implementation would be tested, ie how would one implement the mock database object in phpunit without the actual class being injected when tested Is there advantage to having dependency mapped out and used in doctags like thisp  precodeClass Book     private database         PdInject database       public function setDatabasedatabase        thisgtdatabase  database      codepre  pPimple, on the other hand takes a totally different approach. No docblock tags, no mapping in seperate file,  it seems like some kind of souped up  registry ....p  precode  Objects are defined by anonymous functions that return an instance of the object    define some parameters  container[cookiename]  SESSIONID  container[sessionstorageclass]  SessionStorage codepre  p... that can behave as a factory at same timep  precodecontainer[session]  function c      return new Sessionc[sessionstorage]  codepre  pDeclaring shared ressources always serves the same instance singletonp  precodec[session]  cgtsharefunction c  return new Sessionc[sessionstorage]  codepre  pThis is were I got the idea of using a simple registry that holds either objects or anonymous functions. BUt am I missing something in this approach  Pimple, I can see to how to test, but PhpDependency is unclear to me from a testing point of view.p

Negative 824 pIm in the process of building a rather big web application with PHP  Codeigniter. When I first began this project I was excited by the hosting provider a hrefhttpwww.phpfog.com relnofollowPHPFoga product of PHPasaservice. The idea of simply developing my application and not having to worry about server maintenance, setup, securing, etc appealed to me.p  pHowever, Ive had far too many issues with PHPFog to be comfortable trusting it with hosting my application. Ive run into situations where Ive deleted a file from my git repository, pushed it to my remote repo at phpfog, and wound up with the file not actually being removed on one or all of my application servers. The service is also supposed to provide a hrefhttpwww.newrelic.com relnofollownewrelica for application monitoring however this only worked briefly and hasnt worked at all since August 10th despite numerous complaints. And their customer service is far from satisfactory in helping solve all of these problems.p  pSo now Im considering alternatives, and a hrefhttpwww.heroku.com relnofollowHerokua has caught my attention. Heroku seems like a much more mature cloud application platform. However it does not provide PHP hosting. Instead it provides ROR, Java, Node.js, and Clojure. p  pHow difficult would it be for someone with a lot of experience in PHP and the Codeigniter framework to learn Ruby  Rails and rebuild an application Both organize code in the MVC pattern, so I hope that means my views would only require modification of their hooks to match rubys syntax. Ive already designed my database and all of the SQL queries to access the data I need from my models in CI. What do you guys thinkp  pstrongEDIT 1strong So Ive watched this video as an introduction to ROR development a hrefhttpwww.youtube.comwatchvGzj723LkRJY relnofollowhttpwww.youtube.comwatchvGzj723LkRJYap  pAnd my initial reaction is So ROR is like a coloring book Im skeptical when I see huge chunks of an application come together via something as simple scaffolding. I dont know what to think other than Im afraid that ROR sacrifices some of the granularitycontrol Im used to with phpp  pstrongEDIT 2strong Ive recently discovered a hrefhttpscloudcontrol.com relnofollowhttpscloudcontrol.coma They appear to offer the same type of hosting with PHPasaservice that PHPFog offers but with more control, such as the ability to directly access your database and autoscaling. Still the great idea of a gitpush to deploy to multiple servers without having to deal with setting them up manually. The only thing I dislike is that their datacenters are based in Ireland Amazon AWS. However they told me that theyre planning on moving to the US in the next 3 months and offering pricing in USD.p

Negative 824 pI have an application that contains no session time out, we dont want our users to have to log in every time they come to the site or even if theyve remained idle.  We recently partnered with an external vendor to provide some research data which we are rendering in an iframe.

As I stated previously we dont want to have the end user log in multiple times.  p  pThe solution I came up with was when the end users session expired in the iframe there would be a javascript call top  precodeif called from an iframe, refresh the containing window  if self  top     window.parent.location.href  window.parent.location.href    codepre  pI tested this locally and it works, ie both the parent and the iframe were running on the same application server, however when this is deployed on 2 different domains Parent window and iframe are running on different app servers it is still sending the users to the login screen of the vendor, and if I just press refresh Im successfully relogged in without having to provide credentials.p  pA couple of questionsp  ol liIs there a different way anyone can think of to handle this issueli liAny idea why this would work locally but not across domainsli ol

Negative 824 pI have a UITabBarController.  One tab is a UINavigationController where its rootViewController is a subclass of UIViewController.  In my rootViewController, in my viewDidLoad, I push the first of three ViewControllers.  Based on which UISegmentedControl is pressed, I pop the old view, and I push the viewController that corresponds to the UISegmentedControl.  This works for the most part.  p  pThe problem is if Im currently in the Navigation hierarchy, if I hit the same tab again the tab I am already looking at, it pops the current ViewController off the stack and returns to the rootViewController.  Im not sure why this is happening.  I only have one place where I popViewController and I set a break point there, and it never gets called.  So my assumption is that when I select the tab of the UITabBarController when Im already on that tab, it returns to the rootViewController.  Is that correct  Is there anything I can do to fix this issue  Thanks.p

The doubt I am having is in the jQuery code that does the selection of all selected rows.p  pSee the code snippet of how I did itp  precodevar isAnyDeviceSelected  AreAnyDevicesSelected              if isAnyDeviceSelected                   var siteIds  new Array                 checked.eachfunctionindex                      siteIds[index]  this.parentElement.nextSibling.innerHTMLRetrieve Ids for the selected row.                                    var jsonSiteIdList   siteIdList   JSON.stringifysiteIds   codepre  pNow you see this particular partp  precodesiteIds[index]  this.parentElement.nextSibling.innerHTML codepre  pI am not very happy with this. As you can see, I get to the checkbox node, then go to the parent element which is the td element, then navigate to the next sibling of it, whose innerHTML is the id which I am looking for.p  pFinally, I get a list of all selected ids in the array, though I am not sure if I am doing it the right way. Need a code review from the jQueryJavascript experts over there, and do let me know if there is a better way of doing this using jQuery.p  pEDIT The id selection jQuery code is written based on the table structure rendered by the Gridview. So as long as the GridView HTML render logic strictly follows d same pattern of tabletr td structure, this jQuery will never fail. The solution I am looking for is beyond this I am not sure if I am going a lil farfetched. Is it possible that the gridView will render the td for the siteid with an id of its own, so that my jQuery code is based on the td id and safe forever EDIT end Thanksp

Negative 824 pIve wrote some code that imports a video and takes some DCT coefficients form a specific region of the image frame by frame, it then output a binary file containing the coefficients using a separate function.

If the number of frames in the next iteration has less frames it writes to the previous frames. I was told that i need to initialise one of my for loops before it runs.

Negative 824 pI am trying to figure out the best way to accomplish a relationship in hibernate. I have a Customer object. Each customer has a technical contact, a billing contact, and a sales contact. Each type of contact has the exact same data structure phone, email, address, etc.p  pMy first thought was to create a Contact table, and then have three columns in the Customer table  salescontact, billingcontact, technicalcontact. That would make three distinct foreign key onetoone relationships between the same two tables. However, I have found that this is very difficult to map in Hibernate, at least using annotations.p  pAnother thought was to make it a many to many relationship, and have a type flag in the mapping table. So, any Customer can have multiple Contacts though no more than three, in this case and any Contact can belong to multiple Customers. I was not sure how to map that one either, though. Would tere be a type field on the map table Would this attribute show up on the Contact java model object Would the Customer model have a Set of Contact objects. or three different individual Contact objectsp  pSo I am really looking for two things here  1. What is the best way to implement this in the database, and 2. How do I make Hibernate map that using annotationsp

Negative 824 pIm upgrading an old VB6 application to VB.NET that uses DAO to connect to an Access database.

Of course I could make my own routine manually setting the columns and fill the DataGridView, but if it is a way, Id like to use the DataSource property or some other builtin function.

Negative 824 pDue to the existing framework I am using, a method call is returning a SortedList object.  Because I wrote the other side of this call I know that it is in fact a SortedList.  While I can continue to work with the SortedList, using the generic would convey my meaning better.  So, how do you change the nongeneric SortedList into an appropriately typed generic SortedListp  pThe background on this is that the call is a remote procedure call using the SoapFormatter.

Negative 824 pIm writing a Javascript based table widget that I hope to be capable of handling basically a limitless amount of data.  To do this, the table will make Ajax requests for data only as it is needed when scrolled into view.  I have the basic idea working, but one issue Im struggling with is the resizing of table columns.p  pSince only a section of all the rows is actually rendered at any time, the table tends to reflow as the max width of the columns changes.p  pI thought about iterating the table cells each time the table is rendered, and remembering the max width of each column.  There would still be some reflowing, but once youve seen the widest td, it should stop.  The issue is that this seems to be a kind of clunky solution, and I find myself writing more code than Id like to handle it.p  pHas anyone run into this before, or have any simpler ideas on how to handle it  p
Negative 824 pIm currently scheduling a background task which then queues a number of tile updates.  When the machine is on power, the background task will schedule the next batch of updates. Im using a Maintenance type background task which does not run when on battery.

The information being shown becomes out of date quickly, hence my requirement to frequently update the tile.p  pI also looked at TileUpdater.StartPeriodicUpdate tile updates but that requires a web service somewhere, my code is local in a background task. It works as I want as a MaintenanceTask when the machine has power. p  pIm pretty sure it is possible, I can see other apps updating when on battery mode, without being pinned. p  pHow can I update tiles periodically say every minute regardless of being powered or on battery, from a background taskp

Negative 824 pI have just started making custom views in Android, so I am yet to learn all the facts about the paint draw cycles for view hierarchies, and the effective use of View methods codeinvalidatecode and codeonDrawcode.  But I have come across a puzzling behaviour.p  pI have a custom viewgroup, extending the strongRelativeLayoutstrong class. That is my parent view.  Within that, as children, I have several custom child views.  From time to time, in response to user actions, I need to redraw various parts of these views, both parent and childen.p  pTypically this is the sequence of events. From within a child view class I invalidate a small area of it, by calling codeinvalidaterctcode where rct is the Rect that delimits the area I need to update. p  pThe puzzling thing is that this very localised action provokes a truly excessive and global response. It seems  from the evidence of my LogCat trace output  that p  p1 the ementireem parent view undergoes a complete redrawp  pfollowed byp  p2 every child view undergoes a complete redrawp  pAdmittedly, if response 1 happens then 2 should indeed follow, as all child views would then need complete repainting.  But why does 1 happen at allp  pIs that the normal behaviour for the paint cycle of a view hierarchy  If so, it seems so emwrongem  I would have expected, instead, that only a small area of the parent might need to be redrawn, directly underlying the rectangle marked dirty in the child view that is to be redrawn.  And, further, even that small area of the parent should need redrawing only if the overlying child is not fully opaque in that area.p  pThe evidence for this seemingly emnukethelotem wholesale redrawing activity is that in each onDraw method body for each of my custom views, I have a LogCat trace statement as followsp  precodeOverride protected void onDrawCanvas c     Rect rct  new Rect         Boolean doDraw  c.getClipBoundsrct    Log.vLOGTAG, onDraw Entry doDraw  doDraw    rct  rct     ....    codepre  pThe LogCat output makes it clear that each onDraw call is for the ementireem surface of the view.p

Negative 824 pI am writing a program to control a auto home brewing system on an Arduino Mega micro controller written in CC.  In short, what the program is doing is there is a C application which periodically sends messages through USB to the micro controller.  There is then a messaging interface which I wrote which reads the message, and forwards it to whichever component the message is for.  Each message is 16 bytes long, the first 4 is a transaction code, and the last 12 is for data.  Now, I read in the message and forward to it to my StateController class.  It comes in from the InboundMessage function.  What I am trying to do is I have a struct defined in StateController.h which contains the transaction code and pointer to a member function within StateController.  I defined a QueueList just a simple linked list library, and pushed a bunch of these structs into it.  What I would like to do is then when a message comes into the inboundMessage function, i would like to loop through the linked list until I find a transaction code which matches, and then call the member function which is for that message, passing it the data in the message.  p  pI think I have everything initialized correctly, but here is the problem.  When I try and compile I get an error saying func does not exist in this scope.  I have looked all over for a solution to this, but can not find one.

It results in CopyPNG failures due to the old path.p  pSome testing revealed that Xcode does not remove the references in the PBXPROJ file.

Negative 824 pI have a simple encryption application where I will be encrypting sensitive data in a database. Only the people who have access rights can see these data in decrypted form. I have been looking around for more information on how to do that and here is my project approachp  ol liI am using AES encryption algorithm.li liGenerate an AES key with RNGCryptoServiceProvider. Encrypt info with AES key. li liEncrypt the AES key with and RSA public key.li liStore the private key in a USB file, which I will only give to the people who can have the access rights.li liWhen a rightful person needs to see the decrypted information, they will provide the private key. The app uses the private key to decrypt the AES key, which in turns decrypts the information.li ol  pNow, my question is how can I safely store that private key From what I have been reading, I can obtain the private key using FromXMLString. But, I was thinking that if someone emsomehowem gets the USB file and the XMLFile, he can find the private key by using the FromXMLString similarly. So, how can I protect that file, for example, by using a passphrase Is there any function in c i can use for thatp  pAlso, if I change the key pairs, I have to change the public key and reencrypt the AES key again with the fresh new public key. For that, I found this post a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1307204csharphowtogenerateuniquepublicandprivatekeyviarsaC How to Generate Unique Public and Private Key via RSAa to be quite useful. But, something I am not sure about how the author implemented it. Does he also store the key container name in the private key file Or the ToXMLString automatically does thatp  pThanksp

Negative 824 pmaybe it is a bad question, but I have a Client App which sends some Commands to the server.

I already wrote sth for that in the message receiving function, which simply adds the control to the Form. This is working find, but UserControlLoading Circle, which redraws after some milliseconds, doesnt redraw anymore, because codeAutoResetEvent.WaitOnecode is blocking the GUI Thread.

I suspect Ive not informed the attribute it needs to recheck the permission Breakpoint set on the CreatePermission method only ever hits once. p  pIs an attribute code only ever evaluated once The attribute is currently decorating an event handler for a button click on my Views codebehind.p  pIf I change my method back to use the PrincipalPermissionAttribute then it does work as I expect, logging out and back in as a user without the right role throws the SecurityException I expect.

Negative 824 pI am writing a report in which there are groups in 3 columns, and a subtotal figured at the end of each group.  When I create the grouping, a column is created out to the left of the report.

Negative 824 pAs title, when I have a content list, but not everybody can see them. For example I have group 1 and group 2 I create a post, only the users in group 1 can see it. I create another post, only the users in group 2 can see it.p  pUser 1 in group 1, User 2 in group 2. Then, when user 1 looks at the newest content list, he can only see the post 1. Then, user user 2 looks at the newest content list, he can only see the post 2.p  pYou can see, different account user will see different post in hisher post list. Because I store all posts in one table, and I store the groupid in it, when creating the newest post list for a user, I have to search all newest post and check one by one if the user can see it or not, if there are too many posts which he dont have permission, the performance will be very bad.p  pAlso, the group is not static in some cases, such as my followers, my friends, if so, I still cant store the user id in post table, and have to calculate their relationship to determine heshe can read this post or not. and again, the post can be with multiplepermission groups my followers and my friends can see it.p  pHow can I improve itp  pBTW, why I dont insert the userid array in post record, because maybe the number of group users is very big, so I can only save groupid in it.p  pBTW again,  I have one SNS website.

Negative 824 pI am attempting to create a query that returns a list of specific entity records without returning any duplicated entries from the entityID field.  The query cannot use codeDISTINCTcode because the list is being passed to a reporting engine that doesnt understand result sets containing more than the entityID, and codeDISTINCTcode requires all the codeORDER BYcode fields to be returned.p  pThe result set cannot contain duplicate entityIDs because the reporting engine also cannot process a report for the same entity twice in the same run.  I have found out the hard way that temporary tables arent supported as well.p  pThe entries need to be sorted in the query because the report engine only allows sorting on the entityheader level, and I need to sort based on the report.status.

Negative 824 pEarlier today i installed XNA 4.0 on my computer. p  pI managed to port it from VS2010 to VS2012 by moving the folder in extensionsmicrosoft and update the manifest from 10.0 to 11.0p  pAdditionally i did a devenv.exe setup. p  pAfter that I was able to create projects for windows based on XNA 4.0 under projects. p  pBut when i do create a project i get an error message saying A problem was encountered creating the sub project projectname  object reference not set to an instance of an object. p  pAt first i thought that was just a minor error, clicked OK and went on to the project. p  pBut after the project was created, only maintaining the XNA library, I was not able to create any classes. I was limited to XML, bitmap, effects and sprite font. along with all the stuff in the graphics tab. p  pHope anyone has a solution for this.p

I consider the fact that block variables not being retained as more of a trick I need to remember for the specific use case of avoiding retain cycles.p  pIm wondering, is there a more important, architectural reason why they must not be retained  I would think some other keyword to indicate this might be more clear, as to not mix up the two features listed above.p  pupdate  p  pI should mention this is code that does not use ARC.

Negative 824 pI have a business application that uses datasets that are primarily text based but within the dataset there are also large binary files, upward of about 10 GB.  We need to identify a version control system that will support all of these files.  I really like the way Subversion works, and would like to use something to this tune but every time I setup a test environment it chokes when it hits a large file.p  pBefore everyone responds and tells me you shouldnt use a VC system for large binaries  Yes I am aware of thatp  pI am looking for something that A. Allows you to commit files of any size into a repository, or B. A hybrid solution that could use version control to hold the regular files, and a filer that could hold all the large files.  Ideally I would be able to use a client like tortoise to checkout the entire dataset and then have all of the files come down from both of these sources into a working copy.p  pI am really banging my head against the wall with this and am hoping someone has some ideas as to what to do.p  pThanks in advance....p

Negative 824 pOk, Ive been been building a SPA application, and looking to have a different layout depending on whether the site is viewed on a phone or laptop. p  pIf using Bootstrap, it provides conditional hidingshowing of css classes, and while that works nicely for what it does, it doesnt work well when the layout changes beyond a certain point. with this alternative layout, I wind up needing to put two sets of divs on one page, then use some conditional Javascript code to wipe out the inner html of the target div. This prevents charts from being populated into parts of the page that will never be seen.p  precode    var setViewscape  function       var l  .positionDetails.length     if l  0          setTimeoutfunction              setViewscape         , 10      else          if window.innerWidth lt 899              .landscape.html             .phonescape.cssvisibility, visible          else              .phonescape.html             .landscape.cssvisibility, visible                codepre  pSo far so good, except when I observe what is happening on the page with Knockout, the second set of knockout tags are still being bound to.

Negative 824 pI am working on a website for my company that is both available on our internal network and on internet. And I am asked something that does not seem possible to me but I wanted to ask the question before actually saying that p  pWe have two types of users in our company, those who are actually registered in the Active Directory and so forth have a Windows login account and those who are not.p  pOn our internal network we use the identity given by codeHTTPContext.Current.User.Identity.Namecode With this authentication I am able to check in the Active Directory if the user really exist and authorize him to access the website. This is for the access via our internal network. That is fine because everyone accessing the website via internal network need to have an AD account.p  pNow, the main issue is for the internet access  For the moment, I have a popup that shows up and asks for a login  password pretty basic, the same for everyone who is not on the AD, dont ask me why, this is a requirement...... If the user give correct login password, he can access to the website even though we dont know his real identity. But what I am asked is to have a link on this pop up saying Login using your windows credentials. Then I need retrieve the credentials and check in the AD if they are correct.p  pAfter looking on Internet I found the Windows Identity Fundation that is supposed to manage several ways of Identification, but I dont feel like this is what I need, It seems to be a bit Overkill for what I want to do   p  pAnyone ever tryed this  I know and I told them this is a VERY weird requirements but I said I will have a look anyway...p  p[EDIT 20130913] I tryed something but this is not working maybe you can explain me why. I set my website in IIS to  allow anonymous connection. I have added a page with a login form for the basic authentication and you can access without being authenticated  and a link towards another page that is configured in the web.config to deny the anonymous connection.  I was hopping it would have poped up the Internet Explorer window for Authentication but instead I just got a 401  Unauthorized access.  Is that a normal behavior or a configuration issue p

How do I do it with popen, so that I could pick up a line and throw it onto a function. Plz write some code also for this.p
Negative 824 pI am currently in the process of learning the Spring Framework and I am building a small simple application which users can login to something and logout to the main page.  I have utilised Springs logout functionality and made it redirect to the home page after the user had clicked Logout. This works well and it seems to work, because when I try access a restricted path it displays the login page again, which essentially is good.p  pAlthough, when the user had logged out and gets redirected to the main page and presses the back button on the browser, it seems to go back to the restricted area. How do I stop this from occurringp  pThanks, Matthewp

Negative 824 pI read GAE doc about JDO but i didnt find such example that fit to my scenario. Please help me.p  pI have two JDO classes like codeAcode and codeBcode. codeAcode class have one to many relationship with codeBcode. This relation is unowed also not dependent. class codeAcode and codeBcode has following structure to make it simple i am not using annotationsp  precodeclass A   private String name private String id  primary Key private ListltBgt b  ..... getter setter   class B   private Key key  primary Key private String id  this is the attribute of the Class A private String someData   codepre  pNow my scenario is that First I created class codeAcode objects one by one and save it to the data store using Persistent manager. For this storing codeListltBgt bcode  will be null bcz i dont have data for it. p  pAfter that lets suppose I provide a form that have two fields one for the codeidcode attribute of the Class codeAcode and other for codesomeDatacode attibute. In this user provide the codeidcode of one of the stored objects of class codeAcode. When User submit the result i have to create a class codeBcode object and save it to data store and also have to add it in codelist of Bcode of its corresponding Class codeAcode object. I hope you understand what i want to do. p  pNow my question is that what approach i have to use for maintaining this one to many relationship of JDO classes. Either i have to first retrieve the class codeAcode object based on the codeidcode provided in the form and after getting the object i get codelist of Bcode class objects and add a codeBcode class object in the list and then save the class codeAcode object As object is attached to the PM its automatically save or other approach is that I just create the class codeBcode object and save it to the data store using PM. p  pIf just creating codeBcode class object and saving it to the data store is persistent to the relationship. I simple word when i get the class codeAcode objects does codelist of Bcode class object have the all objects linked to class A object  because B class has attribute which is the primary key of class codeAcode p  pThanksp

Negative 824 pI use iPython notebook a lot together with matplotlib and whilst there are lots of cases when I am happy it automatically displays the images when I call imshow there are moments when I would like to prevent that behavior.p  pSpecifically I am looping over a very large array and generate a figure in matplotlib for each element which should be saved to disk.

Negative 824 pIm writing a recursive descent parser in Ruby that uses regexp to match terminals. Terminals are actually regexps, and are matched against the current position in the string.p  pThe problem is that the terminal regex can contain anything, including regular expressions that match newlines. For example, a terminal that matches anything between parenthesis code[]code will consume whitespace, including the newlines I need to count. Ive come up with a several solutions, but they all have drawbacks which I dont particularly likep  ol lipWhenever a terminal is matched, count all occurences of codencode in the match. This would effectively mean that every string is matched twice instead of once,pli lipInstead of storing the current line, I could store the current position of the string, and obtain the line and column number only when I need it by traversing the string. Obviously problematic because the whole string is traversed every time the line number is needed.pli lipInstead of allowing regexps as terminals, I could allow a simpler form of matchers, similar to what ANTLR allows, and then manually match the string, counting newlines. However, it would require no small amount of extra work and a loss of the matching power regular expressions have.pli ol  pIm leaning towards the third solution, however Id like to see if anyone has dealt with a similar problem and has a better solution which would save me the trouble. p

Negative 824 pI have a SQL view that returns rows containing a couple of value columns. For the sake of simplicity, lets call them codeAmountAcode, codeAmountBcode and codeAmountCcode.p  pIm using a pivot table in Excel to create a report for that data. The source range of the pivot table is generically generated using .Net reflection, then pushed to Excel using Excel Interop. The pivot table is also dynamically generatedconfigured using Excel Interop.p  pI need to calculate and display a field that will count the number of rows where codeAmountAcode is greater than 0. I also need to do the same for codeAmountBcode and codeAmountCcode. The result should be displayed in the pivot table, on the same row level, in the following order  codeAmountAcode  codeCountAcode  codeAmountBcode  codeCountBcode  codeAmountCcode  codeCountCcode. To better understand what Im trying to accomplish, think about a pivot table field summarized by count, but with a behavior similar to the codeCOUNTIFcode function. For example, if the group emProductXem has 10 rows, with only 8 rows having codeAmountAcode greater than 0, it should display a codeCountAcode of 8.p  pI already tried to add a calculated field with the formula codeIFAmountAgt0,1,0code and then sum on this field, but it seems that the formula is applied to the grouped value, not to the actual codeAmountAcode for each row. For example, if the codeSum of AmountAcode for the group emProductXem is greater than 0, it will display a count of 1 codeSum of AmountAcode  0 even if the actual count of rows having codeAmountAcode greater than 0 is 8.p  pI also considered adding new columns in the source range that would use formulas similar to codeIFAmountAgt0,1,0code, then include them with a sum in the pivot table. However, I would like to avoid this, since Im generically generating the source range and adapting this would require a significant amount of refactoring.p  pI thought about adding additional columns to the view to represent the count, but I dont think the view should be responsible of empresentingem the data this would be a job for the report. Additionnally, I cant see how a codeCountAcode column would be relevant to each single row, since it either has or doesnt have an codeAmountAcode greater than 0.p  pSo, is it possible to reproduce the codeCOUNTIFcode behavior on a pivot table field, or should I consider handling the count elsewherep

Negative 824 pI have an iPad application that allows users to access their Gmail accounts using Mailcore2.  I thought I had an understanding of the difference between Gmails Thread Id, Message ID and UID until I looked closely at what Mailcore2 is returning to me when I perform a message fetch operation. I am hoping someone can clarify my confusion.p  pstrongHere is what I think I know from the Gmail docsstrongp  p1 A thread ID groups together messages which have their own message IDs and UIDs that are part of the same conversationp  p2 A UID is specific to a message and is unique only to the folder which contains itp  p3 A message ID is specific to a message and is unique across all folders of an accountp  pstrongI am also making the following assumptionsstrongp  p1 A thread has a thread ID and is a collection of messages. A thread does not have a message ID or a UID.p  p2 A message has a message ID, UID and thread ID even if it is the only message in a threadp  p3 Fetching messages by UID fetches MESSAGES which have a UID that falls in the requested range of UIDs. p  p4 Messages that belong to the same thread will have different UIDs and message IDs but the same Thread ID.p  pOk, so assuming that the above is correct, I would think that during a typical fetch of messages in Mailcore2 by UID, I would receive an array of emails, and from those emails I could look at their thread ID, for example and reconstruct threads on the client side. strongHowever, I seem to get back threads rather than emailsstrong. Additionally, each thread I get does not necessarily contain all its child messages. p  pSo for example, if I have two threads in my inbox, each containing five messages, Mailcore returns to me an array of 2 emails in the form of MCOIMAPMessages. And each email has one thread ID, one message ID and one UID. So I am not sure how to access contained emails on these two threads. I see that there is a references array... but inspecting this object doesnt reveal anything useful. When I log the contents of each thread, I get only part of the contents  say 4 out of the 5 messages on the thread.

Negative 824 pI have been wondering what would be the best way to solve the following situationp  pThe application is version 1.0.0 and contains an object that perform a calculation, let sayp  precodeTheResult  SomeInputValue  2 codepre  pemlets assume SomeInputValue100, so TheResult200emp  pSomeInputValue is stored in the database but TheResult is not.p  pThen, we update the application to version 1.0.1 because we notify that we had a bug in the calculation formula forTheResult and correct it to the 1.0.1 versionp  precodeTheResult  SomeInputValue   2.5 codepre  pemTheResult250emp  pNow, when the user gets his 1.0.1 version he notifies that TheResult is not anymore the same as earlier. But this is not acceptable in our situation. We want the user to see 200, no matter if that came with a buggy calculation at a time. But we also want to be able to give option for the user to get the value calculated in line with 1.0.1 as well.p  pI have not found any other way so far than to save also TheResult to the database and insert the version number to the same row as additional information. Then when the database item is read with 1.0.1 we are not calculating it but instead showing the database value 200 and notify the user that this value came from database and it might be different if recalculated with the new version.p  pstrongIs this the way to maintain calculated values with earlier application versionsstrong by inserting a version number information to the database p

Negative 824 pIm trying to import a public key from my python server into an iOS keychain. I receive the key from my server as an NSData object. p  pIm using the addPeerPublicKeykeyBits function from Apples Crypto example to convert the NSData into a SecKeyRef, which is how I need to reference it. The function is failing to store the key in the keychain and Im not sure why. SecItemAdd returns 0success but getKeyRefWithPersistentKeyRef returns null. p  pIm using PyCrypto on my server to generate the RSA keys and exporting them to my client in DER format. Is there anything else I need to do to convert the format to make it storable in the Apple keychainp

Negative 824 pI recently set up a Mavericks Server with Xcode Continuous Integration. I created a bot and the bot itself works well running tests and archiving from a remote git server by polling.p  pMy problem is that when I use the web view to view logs the page does not refresh automatically. As an example if I open the server while a integration test is running or if I start integration tests manually from the web view the information just show the spinning wheel like it keeps running, and I have to refresh the page manually to get updated information.p  pThe same happens when I use the Big Screen mode that cycles through the bots showing various information. The views never refresh. I thought that was the whole point with Big Screen to have a screen that always show updated information.p  pI have tried with several different browsers on different machines, and restarted the Xcode service on the server and restarted the server itself with no change. I also tried creating a test project that uses a git repository stored locally on the OS X Server.p  pHas anyone had similar issues Does this work at all Ive tried googling but cant find anything.p
Negative 824 pSo I want to load my data collections in a background thread and then bind my treeview to the new collection rather than having the background thread queue things up on the dispatcher every time it wants to add an item to the list [sounds inefficient]. p  pIs this possible I create the new data structure and it is output as pd.result on a background thread. When the UI thread checks that the dialog box has closed, it should then set p  precodeModuleHierarchyVM.TopLevelModules  pd.Result as ObservableCollectionltModuleViewModelgt codepre  pafter this the event OnLoadVCD is called. I have an event handler that then tries to set a treeviews itemsource to the new collection. p  precodethis.AvailableModulesTreeView.ItemsSource  gvvm.ModuleHierarchyVM.TopLevelModules codepre  pThis crashes with the error The calling thread cannot access this object because a different thread owns it.p  pNot even sure how to debug it, the call stack doesnt give any real details.p  pHowever, if I just set the Itemsource to a blank new empty collection like sop  precodethis.AvailableModulesTreeView.ItemsSource  IEnumerableltobjectgtnew Listltobjectgt codepre  pit doesnt crash but then its not displaying my data either. Any ideas what could be causing the crashp  pI thought it might be that I was updating the UI from the wrong thread, so I tried both calling the dispatcher with begininvoke, and checking that I am indeed the UI thread with dispatcher.checkaccess. so that does not seem to be the issue.  However, I really dont know what is going on.p  pAnother way I could implement this is to just make my parsing routine just update the original data structure that is bound to the treeview by caling dispatcher on each item as it is added to the observable collection. However, even if that is the only solution, I really dislike not knowing why something doesnt work.  In my mind, it seems reasonable to just create an entirely new data structure on a different thread, and then rebind the new datastructure to the treeview, discarding the old one.  It also seems cleaner to me than dozens of 1 line ObservableCollectionInstance.Add calls being placed on the dispatcher while parsing through a file on the background thread.p  pFull Codep  pmethod called by UI threadp  precodepublic bool LoadPortInterfacestring VCDFileName      ProgressDialog pd  new ProgressDialogLoading File , VCDFileName     pd.Owner  Application.Current.MainWindow     pd.WindowStartupLocation  WindowStartupLocation.CenterOwner     ModuleHierarchyVM.TopLevelModules.Clear       VCDData TempVCDOutput  null     Funcltobjectgt handler  delegate              return VCDParser.ParseVCDFileForAllPortsVCDFileName, this, pd.Worker, out TempVCDOutput          pd.RunWorkerThreadhandler     pd.ShowDialog     if pd.DialogResult  true              ModuleHierarchyVM.TopLevelModules  pd.Result as ObservableCollectionltModuleViewModelgt         VCDOutput  TempVCDOutput          OnLoadVcd  codepre  pResponse to OnLoadVCD event handler in graphviewerp  precodevoid gvvmLoadVCDEventobject sender, EventArgs e      this.AvailableModulesTreeView.ItemsSource  gvvm.ModuleHierarchyVM.TopLevelModules  codepre

Negative 824 pI have two thread one is to capture the audiostream from microphone captureProcess, and the other one playProcessis to play the audiostream the Record just captured. The shared data is a bytearray. Thread captureProcess will record a 0.2s audiostream and store it in a ByteArray. And pLayProcess should play it immediately. It will repeat the process. As a result, the program should play what it captured with a 0.2s delay.

Negative 824 pFriends,p  pIm looking for an solution on SQL DB server. Im being working in support organization on managing SQL Server.p  pWhen we make some changes on SQL DB Schema changes, table alteration, data etc.. and found it is not compatible we need to roll back easily. p  pSomething like, before i make any changes on my DB server need to preserve current state of DB and once changes were made and if looks good then i can commit permanantly. If not working properly i can discard the changes and revert to previous state quickly.p  pIs there any such option availablep
Negative 824 pThis question pertains to efficient sampling from multinomial distributions with varying sample sizes and probabilities. Below I describe the approach I have used, but wonder whether it can be improved with some intelligent vectorisation.p  pIm simulating dispersal of organisms amongst multiple populations. Individuals from population codejcode disperse to population codeicode with probability codep[i, j]code. Given an initial abundance of 10 in population 1, and probabilities of dispersal codec0.1, 0.3, 0.6code to populations 1, 2, and 3, respectively, we can simulate the dispersal process with codermultinomcodep  precodeset.seed1 rmultinom1, 10, c0.1, 0.3, 0.6        [,1]  [1,]    0  [2,]    3  [3,]    7 codepre  pWe can extend this to consider codencode source populationsp  precodeset.seed1 n lt 3 p lt replicaten, diffc0, sortrunifn1, 1 X lt sample100, n codepre  pAbove, codepcode is a matrix of probabilities of moving from one population column to another row, and codeXcode is a vector of initial population sizes.

The coderowSumscode of this matrix give the new population sizes.p  pId like to repeat this many times, with constant probability matrix but with varying predefined initial abundances. The following small example achieves this, but is inefficient with larger problems. The resulting matrix gives the postdispersal abundance in each of three populations for each of 5 simulations for which population had different initial abundances.p  precodeX lt matrixsample100, n5, replaceTRUE, nrown  applysapplyapplyX, 2, functionx    lapplyseqlenncolp, functioni      rmultinom1, x[i], p[, i]      , functionx do.callcbind, x, simplifyarray, 3, rowSums        [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5]  [1,]   79   67   45   28   74  [2,]   92   99   40   19   52  [3,]   51   45   16   21   35 codepre  pIs there a way to better vectorise this problemp

Negative 824 pI was looking at the codehttpthreejs.orgexampleswebglnearestneighbour.htmlcode and had a few questions come up.

The only way I know to do this is that you get the positions of the buffered geometries and then put them into the kdtree to determine the nearest vertice and go from there.

Negative 824 pIve been working a lot with F lately, and recently wrote a little MVC application with a C web project and an F class library, the latter of which contained the bulk of the code.p  pI wanted to use the async controllers feature of the later versions of MVC where you can return a codeTaskltActionResultgtcode.

Negative 824 pI know this has been asked and discussed a lot here, but Ive spent the last few days scouring the internet for different solutions, and no matter what I try  nothing seems to work.p  pEDIT Tried a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions14658268whycantiforcelandscapeorientationwhenuseuinavigationcontrollerrq1this solutiona as well, still no luck...p  pI have an iOS7 app I currently dont care for support for iOS6, but itll be nice to have that has a root view controller with a menu that slides from the side a hrefhttpsgithub.comromaonthegoREFrostedViewController relnofollowthis onea, to be specific and lets you switch between different screens. The selected screen is loaded into a navigation controller, and theres a modal type segue between the navigation controller and the screens view controllers except for the screen that appears first, which has a relationship with the root view controller. I also tried this with push segues, same result. one of these screens has to display only in landscape mode, the others only in portrait.p  pfor this purpose, in my root view controller Ive implemented the followingp  precode voidawakeFromNib      self.contentViewController  [self.storyboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifiercontentController]     self.menuViewController  [self.storyboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifiermenuController]   NSUIntegersupportedInterfaceOrientations      if self.contentViewController         return [self.contentViewController supportedInterfaceOrientations]      return UIInterfaceOrientationMaskPortrait   BOOLshouldAutorotate      return YES  codepre  pIn my navigation view controller I have implemented the followingp  precodeBOOLshouldAutorotate      return YES  NSUIntegersupportedInterfaceOrientations      return [self.topViewController supportedInterfaceOrientations]  UIInterfaceOrientationpreferredInterfaceOrientationForPresentation      return [self.topViewController preferredInterfaceOrientationForPresentation]  codepre  pand in each of the portrait screens view controllers Ive implementedp  precodeNSUIntegersupportedInterfaceOrientations      return UIInterfaceOrientationMaskPortrait  UIInterfaceOrientationpreferredInterfaceOrientationForPresentation      return UIInterfaceOrientationPortrait  codepre  pand in the landscape screenp  precode NSUInteger supportedInterfaceOrientations      return UIInterfaceOrientationMaskLandscape  UIInterfaceOrientationpreferredInterfaceOrientationForPresentation      return UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeLeft  codepre  pThe first screen of the app is a portrait one. So what happens is, the app loads in portrait mode and doesnt rotate to any other orientation which is great. BUT Once I load the landscape screen, it loads in portrait mode, and only when I rotate the device to landscape mode, it rotates and locks into landscape mode. And once I switch back to a portrait screen, it loads in landscape mode, and only when I rotate the device to portrait, is rotates and locks into portrait mode, and for some reason makes the screen VERY narrow...p  pThe closest Ive ever gotten to a decent solution was implementing this in the landscape screens view controllerp  precodevoidviewWillAppearBOOLanimated     [super viewWillAppearanimated]      CGRect screenRect  [[UIScreen mainScreen] bounds]     [[UIApplication sharedApplication] setStatusBarOrientationUIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeLeft]     CGAffineTransform landscapeTransform  CGAffineTransformMakeRotationdegreesToRadian270     landscapeTransform  CGAffineTransformTranslatelandscapeTransform, 0.0, 0.0     [self.navigationController.view setTransformlandscapeTransform]     self.navigationController.view.bounds  CGRectMake0.0, 0.0, screenRect.size.height, screenRect.size.width   voidviewWillDisappearBOOLanimated     [super viewWillDisappearanimated]      CGRect screenRect  [[UIScreen mainScreen] bounds]     [[UIApplication sharedApplication] setStatusBarOrientationUIInterfaceOrientationPortrait]     CGAffineTransform landscapeTransform  CGAffineTransformMakeRotationdegreesToRadian0     landscapeTransform  CGAffineTransformTranslatelandscapeTransform, 0.0, 0.0     [self.navigationController.view setTransformlandscapeTransform]     self.navigationController.view.bounds  CGRectMake0.0, 0.0, screenRect.size.width, screenRect.size.height  define degreesToRadianx MPI  x180.0 codepre  pAnd changing this view controllers supported and preferred orientations to portrait. Which basically makes the whole app lock in portrait mode. Although it looks fine, it seems kinda sketchy and I would much rather have a clean solution, and support landscape left AND right.

I did a consistency test. The magnitude of acceleration along phones X,Y,Z axis should be equal to the magnitude of acceleration along the trueeast, truenorth and the vertically upwards.

Negative 824 pOur application distinguishes between data for a particular user actually a legal entity, but well call it user for simplicity and data which is shared between all users. It is a requirement that user data be held in a separate schema for each user. So there is data which is common and shared in a schema which can be accessed by all users, and a number of schemas each of which can only be accessed by the user to which it relates. These user schemas would each contain the same set of tables so we might have something like USERA.ACCOUNT, USERB.ACCOUNT and so on, and SHARED.PRODUCT in the common schema. We have achieved this and produced something which meets the requirements quite nicely by specifying TableschemaSHARED for the entity types representing common data. We dont specify the schema on the user entity types  the choice of schema to look in is left up to the DAO. We have one DAO per user, each configured to use the appropriate user schema and selected on the basis of the user context associated with any given operation.p  pSo far so good  but the name of the shared schema is now hard coded into the entity class files for the shared data types. And because its in an annotation it is compiled into them. This is no good for us since typically when deploying on client sites we find that the client DBA wishes to dictate schema names but we do not wish to have to recompile in order to achieve this. Even worse, at a client site we would typically have multiple systems for different purposes with different schema names PROD, UAT, etc etc and to do this using multiple recompiled copies of the same system would be madness. p  pI have not been able to find a way to override the schema defined in the annotation. Is anyone aware of a way to achieve this I have tried porting our system from using hibernate directly SessionFactory etc to JPA EntityManagers and so forth as this in principal allows the schema attribute in the annotation to be overridden by an entry in the ORM.xml, but there appears to be a world of problems with using JPAJTASpring whereby operations in the transaction lifecycle such as flush no longer happen as you would expect, so I backed away from that. p  pAny suggestions would be most welcome ...p

Negative 824 pI would like to verify that my understanding of the fundamental matrix is correct and if its possible to compute F without using any corresponding point pairs.p  pThe fundamental matrix is calculated as codeF  invtransposeMrRSinvMlcode where Mr and Ml are the right and left intrinsic camera matrices, R is the rotation matrix that brings the right coordinate system to the left one, and S is the skew symmetric matrix p  precodeS  0    T[3]   T[2]  where T is the translation vector of the right coordinate system      T[3]     0  T[1]  from the left.    T[2]  T[1]      0 codepre  pI understand that the fundamental matrix can be computed with the 8point algorithm, but I do not have any point correspondences. However, both of my cameras are calibrated, so I have all intrinsic and extrinsic parameters. From the definition of the fundamental matrix above, it is possible to compute F with these parameters alone, rightp  pThe problem I experience is that the fundamental matrix seems wrong when calculated from its definition. At the moment, I would just like to know if my understanding above is correct.p

Negative 824 pIm trying to integrate Swagger to my Django Rest Framework API. I installed the relevant package and followed the quickstart guide from the Github page. Im having some problems though.

Is there any way to explicitly tell it the serializer it should use p  pFinally here is an example of my APIViews GETcode to show the serializer usage. As you can see there is two different serializers usedp  precodeisValid  self.isValidUrlrequest.path     if not isValid         return ResponseError The url is empty.      url  self.trimTheUrlrequest.path     print url      try         target  models.APINode.objects.getuniquePathurl         perm  IsOwner         perm.hasobjectpermissionrequest, self, target         check is the APINode collection or item         if target.objectType  item             return JSON data of the materialItem             serializer  ProductSerializertarget.materialItem             return Responseserializer.data         else             find objects in this collection             children  models.APINode.objects.filterparentPathtarget.uniquePath             serializer  APINodeSerializerchildren, manyTrue             return Responseserializer.data      except models.APINode.DoesNotExist         return Response404 No such collection or materialItem. codepre  pFor whatever its worth the API represents a collection amp resource structure much like a file system with ndeep paths.p
Negative 824 pIm wondering if its possible to put together a fully nonblocking Clojure backend web application with httpkit.p  pActually any Ringcompatible http server would be fine by me Im mentioning httpkit because it a hrefhttphttpkit.orgserver.htmlclaimsa to have an eventdriven, nonblocking model.p  pIf I got it right and Im not an expert, so please tell me if Im working on wrong assumptions, the principles of such a nonblocking model for a web application are the followingp  ol liHave a few superfast OS threads handle all the CPUintensive computing these emmust never be waitingem.li liHave a lot of weak threads handle the IO database calls, webservice calls, sleeping, etc. these emare meant mostly to be waitingem.li liThis is beneficial because the waiting time spent on the handling of a request is typically 2 disk access to 5 web services calls orders of magnitude higher than the computing time.li ol  pFrom what I have seen, this model is supported by default on the a hrefhttpwww.playframework.comPlay Frameworka Scala and a hrefhttpnodejs.orgNode.jsa JavaScript platforms, with promisebased utilities for managing asynchrony programmatically.p  pLets try to do this in a Ringbased clojure app, with Compojure routing. I have a route that constructs the response by calling the codemyhandlecode functionp  precodedefroutes myroutes   GET myurl req myhandle req    def myapp noir.util.middlewareapphandler [myroutes] defn startmyserver []    httpkitrunserver myapp codepre  pIt seems the commonly accepted way of managing asynchrony in Clojure applications is CSPbased, with the use of the a hrefhttpsgithub.comclojurecore.asynccore.asynca library, with which Im totally fine. So if I wanted to embrace the nonblocking principles listed above, Id implement codemyhandlecode this way p  precoderequire [clojure.core.async as a]  defn myhandle [req]   alt     ago  go makes channels calls asynchronous, so Im not really waiting here      let [mydbresource athread fetchmydbresource  thread will delegate the waiting to weaker threads            mywebresource athread fetchmywebresource]        constructmyresponse alt mydbresource                               alt mywebresource       codepre  pThe CPUintensive codeconstructmyresponsecode task is performed in a codegocodeblock whereas the waiting for external resources is done in codethreadcodeblocks, as suggested by Tim Baldridge in a hrefhttpswww.youtube.comwatchvenwIIGzhahwthis video on core.asynca 3855p  pBut that is not enough to make my application nonblocking. Whatever thread goes through my route and will call the codemyhandlecode function, will be strongwaitingstrong for the response to be constructed, rightp  pemWould it be beneficial as I believe to make this HTTP handling nonblocking as well, if so how can I achieve itemp  hr  pstrongEDITstrongp  pAs codemomentum pointed out, the missing ingredient for a nonblocking handling of the request is to use httpkit channels. In conjunction with core.async, the above code would become something like this  p  precodedefn myhandle [req]   httpkitwithchannel req channel     ago       let [mydbresource athread fetchmydbresource            mywebresource athread fetchmywebresource            response constructmyresponse alt mydbresource                                            alt mywebresource]        send channel response        close channel       codepre  pThis lets you embrace an asynchronous model indeed.p  pThe problem with this is that it is pretty much incompatible with Ring middleware. A Ring middleware uses a function call for obtaining the response, which makes it essentially synchronous. More generally speaking, it seems eventdriven handling is not compatible with a pure functional programming interface, because triggering events means having sideeffects.p  pId be glad to know if there is a Clojure library that addresses this.p

Negative 824 pI have just been playing around in FF32 amp Safari 7, with codeposition stickycode. And it works perfecly with codetop 0pxcode or codeleft 0pxcode to stick horizontally, but it doesnt seem to work when I try codebottom 0pxcode or even better, combine codebottom 0 left 0code it doesnt set itself to the bottom of the element. This behaviour could be tried out here a hrefhttphtml5demos.appspot.comstaticcsssticky.html relnofollowhttphtml5demos.appspot.comstaticcsssticky.htmla, by simply changing the codetop 10pxcode attribut to codebottom 0code. Is that not supposed to workp  pI think it is a valid usecase to stick something to the bottom in the same way as one would want to stick something to the top. In our case it is, because I am interested in having something sticky on horizontal scroll, but I want this element to be at the bottom of the parent element.p  pAnyway, any suggestions and extra info are welcome.p

This huge queue is consisted of sublists of size 43 maximum.  This queue is passed into the codefactorizerworkercode.

Negative 824 pOur solution uses Devexpress libraries 13.1.5. We keep used dlls in local folder. But we got problem after installing another program with Devexpress libs.

Also GAC dlls are larger than our.p  pHow can I resolve this issue Ive already tried to add some assembly redirects, but nothing changed.p

Negative 824 pIve built an AngularJS application over the last several months that utilizes a MySQL database  for its data. This data is fetched by Angular making calls to PHP and PHP returns JSON strings etc. p  pThe issue is once this application is running inside nodewebkit, none of the php works, so all of the content areas are empty. I assume though the documentation on this issue is null and so i have no confirmation this happens because Nodewebkit is a clientside application framework and therefor wont run serverside languages like php. Is there a way to expand node webkit to run php and other server side languages p  pI have done my best to find an answer to this question before posting, but documentation for this is nonexistent, and all of the information I have found about nodewebkit talks about installing node on your server and installing npms for MySQL and having angular make calls to node. This defeats the purpose of the application entirely as it is designed so that the exedebrpmdmg can run and you can set up a database with any cloud database provider and be ready to go. Not ideal if you have to buy a vps just to run this one thing.p  pI have to assume this is possible in some way. i refuse to believe that everyone with an nw application hard codes all their data.p  pThanks in advancep

This is for getting the access token and retrieving mail by OAuth2.p  pI could just go into the CurlIO class and add the curl fields there, but know there should be an easier way to configure proxy. Im figuring it would be a call like these belowp  precodeclientgtsetApplicationNameapplicationname clientgtsetClientIdclientid clientgtsetClientSecretclientsecret codepre  pbtw, this is a web service Im creating, that shouldnt require user input.p  pSo to summarize, how do I set the proxy configurations for usage with Oauthp

Negative 824 pI am making a 2D tile game. Assume the Yellowbrownish tile is the Hero character, while the deep blue tiles are movable distances.p  pOn the Hero, a Sprite Renderer, Box Collider 2D and a Rigidbody 2D are added to the game object layer is Character. The size is 1 x 1 unit and the coordinate is 0, 0.p  pThen, I create 4 movablerange tiles duplicated from Prefab, size is 1 x 1 unit, layer is Foreground surrounding the Hero.

Negative 824 pMy stack is Angular.js, Karma, Karmacoverage Istanbul and Jasmine.p  pI have been running Code Coverage analysis over my app, the problem, and thus the question, is that I get strongService Astrong marked as covered by tests in green when it actually strongdoes not have any tests associatedstrong.p  pI suspect that the following scenario is to blamep  ul liI know that strongService Astrong is used by strongController Bstrong.li listrongController Bstrong is covered by tests, and the Code Coverage results mark it correctly as covered by tests.li listrongService Astrong is not being mocked when testing strongController Bstrong.li ul  pI think that since strongservice Astrong is indirectly called by strongController Bstrongs tests, I get the wrong result.p  pAny ideas Am I suspecting the right thing Is there any ways around it so I can get an accurate test coverage result in this aspectp  pThanks in advancep

Negative 824 pI have an abstract class with some concrete and abstract protected methods, and I have a PHPUnit test for this abstract class.p  pThen I have classes that extend the abstract class and implement the abstract protected methods.  p  pIm curious of the smartest way to test that the child classes return what they need to return from the otherwise abstracted protected methods.p  pI have read a lot that you should not test privateprotected methods, but Im finding this awkward because to get code coverage across the protected method, I must replicate many of the tests from the abstract class test, which involves producing many mock objects and setting their methods to return specific values.p  pThe end result will be a lot of tests that have very tight coupling to other classes.  If I changes a class, the tests on for class need to change totally ok, and then countless mock implementation of that class will need to change also.p  pAt the end of the day, if the abstract class works, then I know my child object will work also, so long as its implementation of the abstract protected methods returns an expected value.p  pSo Im wondering if Im overlooking a pattern.  p  pDuplicating tests across every child class doesnt seem to be better than testing that the child classes correctly implement their interfaces.p

Negative 824 pSo I had a function that was intended to read from a file. It was declared and defined in FileIO.h, like sop  precodestdstring ReadFromFilestdifstreamamp in      stdstring out     in gtgt out     return out  codepre  pNow, I included this header into another header, which was itself included into another header, which was included into main. Even though it wasnt included into multiple things, I have the codeifndefdefendifcode preprocessors on all my header files, with unique names.p  pI couldnt for the life of me figure out why it was still throwing the linker error in fact, it was throwing it twice once in my Main, and once in the second header file. Then I tried simply declaring the function in FileIO.h, like thisp  precodestdstring ReadFromFilestdifstreamamp in codepre  pThen I defined it in FileIO.cpp. No more linker errors Is this because I was defining variables in the function, and they were being compiled and then seen later like codestdstring outcode, for example, or is it from something else Id love a good lesson on why this worked.

Negative 824 pWhen you run codehashcode on a number, will it always return the same value within the same ruby processp  pIt seems that code2.hashcode always returns the same value within a single process of irb, but if you close and reopen irb, you get a different value. Will it always stay consistent for every number within a process p  pI believe that ruby uses the memory location for at least certain objects to calculate the hash, is this the same for numbers And if so, are two instances of a number always going to have the same memory locationp

Negative 824 pIm developing application, which sends emails. Email users are filtering by series of filters before sending email. I try to use DDD pattern, and i put all of filtering logic to domain layer. But i do not know where i should implement filter sequence. Each filter need some information about user, and they need to be loaded from separate storages. By performance issues it is better to filter users by first, most simple filter, than by another and so on, and load information for filter when it is need. I implemented sequence on service layer, but now i need to implement another method, from another context, which must answer if email can be send to specified user. I have to decide 1 I can move sequence logic to domain layer  maybe to account entity, and use lazy loading to load filters information 2 I can share service layer to another context, and implement special method on itp  pI like first choice, because if i will add new filter, i have to only change domain layer. But it seems that lazy loading is antipattern. So, can somebody help me to solve this dilemmap

Negative 824 pI am a fairly new at using processing and opencv, so please bear with me. I have posted my question on both stackoverflow and on the a hrefhttpforum.processing.orgtwodiscussion10130howtodetectmultiplefacesusingopencvinordertogenerateanoutputofflickeringledlightslatest relnofollowprocessing foruma to reach a wider audience and find a solution  so apologies if this looks as if I am carelessly cross posting, as this is not my intentions.p  pI have been working on a light installation using Arduino and Processing. I am capturing people using face detection with a webcam and opencv, and translating it into a light installation that is working off a 16x32 LED matrix panel. The light installation is a response of the amount of spectators who are viewing the lights and being recorded at the same time  the idea is that the more people being recorded will generate a greater display of flickering lights, and when no one is viewingbeing recorded, the lights will not flicker.p  pI have managed to get opencv to detect faces and output it to Arduino to display on the lights, however I can only get the lights to flash more intensely when people are not being detected, rather than when they are being detected. Therefore, the lights are working in reverse, and they flicker more when noone is being detected, and less when there are people being detected.p  pI have attached both my Processing and Arduino code for reference, although I do not think that the Arduino code needs to be changed at all.p  p I have highlighted an area in the processing code which I believe is the part that is causing the issuep  pI would really appreciate who knows a way of changing this so the face detection triggers more lights  p  pThanksp  pProcessing Codep  precode import gab.opencv.  import java.awt.  import processing.video.  import processing.serial.  import java.awt.Color   Capture video  OpenCV opencv   Serial myPort   Create object from Serial class  int inByte  1    void setup       size640, 480    video  new Capturethis, 6402, 4802    opencv  new OpenCVthis, 6402, 4802    opencv.loadCascadeOpenCV.CASCADEFRONTALFACE    video.start     printlnSerial.list    colorModeHSB, 100,100,100    String portName  Serial.list[5]    myPort  new Serialthis, Serial.list[5], 9600      void draw      scale2    opencv.loadImagevideo     imagevideo, 0, 0      noFill    stroke0, 255, 0    strokeWeight3    Rectangle[] faces  opencv.detect    printlnfaces.length     do cool stuff here       int x  intrandom32      int y  intrandom16      int H  int222      int S  int5      int L  intrandom3        int R   intrandom255      int G   intrandom255      int B   intrandom255        int F  0      String toard  x    y    R    G    B    F .        myPort.writetoard         for int i  0 i lt faces.length i          rectfaces[i].x, faces[i].y, faces[i].width, faces[i].height        toard  x    y    0    0    0  .         myPort.writetoard         if faces.length  0         delayfaces[0].x                        listen back to the serial data from arduino       this is handy for debugging         while myPort.available  gt 0             send the string to the arduino over serial port          inByte  myPort.read               void captureEventCapture c     c.read   codepre  pArduino codep  precode const char EOPmarker  .  char serialbuf[32]   include ltAdafruitGFX.hgt  include ltRGBmatrixPanel.hgt  Hardwarespecific library  define MAXSTRINGLEN 20  include ltstring.hgt   define CLK 8   MUST be on PORTB Use pin 11 on Mega  define LAT A3  define OE  9  define A   A0  define B   A1  define C   A2  RGBmatrixPanel matrixA, B, C, CLK, LAT, OE, false   uint8t r7, g7, b7   void setup       Serial.begin9600    matrix.begin    pinMode13, OUTPUT    digitalWrite13, LOW     void loop         if Serial.available gt 0         static int bufpos  0         char inchar  Serial.read          if inchar  EOPmarker            serialbuf[bufpos]  inchar           bufpos                   else             serialbuf[bufpos]  0           bufpos  0 []               this is where we grab the x y HSB values and do whatever we thing is nice ltspan classEmoticon Emoticon1gtltspangtltspangtltspangt                   send back to processing for debugging             int x  atoisubStrserialbuf, , 1           int y  atoisubStrserialbuf, , 2           int R  atoisubStrserialbuf, , 3           int G  atoisubStrserialbuf, , 4           int B  atoisubStrserialbuf, , 5           int F  atoisubStrserialbuf, , 6             float vR  mapR, 0,255, 0,7           float vG  mapG, 0,255, 0,7           float vB  mapB, 0,255, 0,7             Serial.writex        matrix.drawPixelx, y, matrix.Color333vR, vG, vB                this is the function that allows us to easily grab an item from the string by index   char subStr char inputstring, char separator, int segmentnumber     char act, sub, ptr    static char copy[MAXSTRINGLEN]    int i    strcpycopy, inputstring    for i  1, act  copy i lt segmentnumber i, act  NULL       sub  strtokract, separator, ampptr      if sub  NULL break        return sub    codepre

Which is fine for me.p  pBut the troublesome is the Updating part.p  precode[HttpPost] public class ActionResult SaveMyViewModel vmData      FirstModel firstModel  new FirstModel     SecondModel secondModel  new SecondModel      firstModel.MyDetails  vmData.MyDetails     secondModel.MyDetails  vmData.MyDetails2      db.FirstModel.AddfirstModel     db.SaveChanges      secondModel.FirstModelID  firstModel.MyDetails     db.SecondModel.AddsecondModel     db.SaveChanges  codepre  pNow it seems simple in my part because there is only 1 property in FirstModel and 2 Properties to fill in SecondModel. But as the model goes, it is hard to manually fill them.

Negative 824 pSo Im currently in the process of migrating a descent sized program from Rebol 3 to Red.  Said program relies on a large binding to a C library clang.  I have rewritten the binding portion in RedSystem, and am interfacing that code with Red through wrapper routines.  The current convention I have been using is to cast the pointers and void pointers needed as parameters and returned by the C code to redsystem integers and box them up as Red integers.  This is fairly easy and convenient.p  pSince I can only access the raw integer data instead of the actual struct, I would suspect then that I cant pass a pointer back out through a parameter as the boxed data is being copied before being passed using the above methodology, anymore.p  pSo, is there a recommended methodology to passing pointers back out through parameters, aka how do we pass by reference with routinesp  precodetwiddle routine [     arg [integer]     return [integer] ] [     arg 321     test declare struct [         dummy [integer]     ]     testdummy 456     as integer test ]  a 123 b twiddle a  print a If I could pass by reference this would be 321 print b codepre

Negative 824 pI am using Mono.Cecil to automatically generate lots of, simple, generic factory methods providing a convenient API for a library. The factories are generated for properties marked with a special custom attribute. To generate them, I must know the type of such property. The nongeneric case is simplep  precodeModuleDefinition module   obtained from ReadAssembly  foreach var type in module.Types     if  type is marked with the right attribute          foreach var prop in type.Properties             if  prop is marked with the right attribute                  GenerateFactorytype, prop, prop.PropertyType codepre  pHowever, some of the types marked are in fact generics. In this case, the attribute on the type contains the generic arguments for which the factory should be made, like thisp  precode[EmitFactoriestypeofint] public class ClassltTgt      [MagicProperty]     T Property  get set   codepre  phere, I want the factory to be made for codeClassltintgt.Propertycode. I am handling this case by making codetypecode a codeGenericInstanceTypecode. However, I cannot get to the type of the property  to enumerate codetype.Propertiescode I need to first call codeResolvecode, which loses all generic information. The property type is then codeTcode instead of codeintcode, which of course makes later code fail miserably.p  pMono.Cecil has codeGenericInstanceTypecode and codeGenericInstanceMethodcode, but there is no equivalent for properties. I tried using codemodule.Importprop.PropertyType, typecode giving codetypecode as the generic parameter provider, but this doesnt work.p  pDo you have any ideas on how I can resolve the actual property type Note, that it can be completely unrelated to codeTcode, codeTcode itself, or have codeTcode burried inside e.g., codeListltTgtcode. Ideally, it would work given codetypecode as a codeTypeReferencecode  this way I would not have to write separate code for the nongeneric and generic cases.p

The same is happening with a similar view, which is smaller so all iPhone works just 4S. So it is definitely issue related to screen size and manipulating with constraints. Looks like all objects that are bellow screen view itself after creation, so you have to scroll it to see them are inactive.p  pAny help will be greatly appreciated.p

So now the path is not constant it creates new path each time . The path is constant until PluginKitPlugin later the string changes each time as you can see above. So my question is how can I get a static path where I can cache my data between different runs of my application .p  pThis behaviour is same with NSDocumentDirectoryp

Negative 824 pI am working on project for an app that uses AngularJS. I need to manipulate the DOM quite a bit, based on user events, i.e click, change, etc. p  pI am using vanilla javascript and ngdirectives for event listening  no jquery. I read that it is not good practice to manipulate the DOM within the controller. Also, I am NOT trying to codengincludecode a long list of external javascript files to separate the client side functionality of each widget.  p  pI am wondering what are best practices for manipulating a DOM while maintaining a declutteredscalable project environment  p  pSome examples of what I am trying to do one of my functions toggle a class to a DOM element on click. One function changes search filters in the UI, when a button is clicked, etc. One button changes the view layout based on user preference, one function changes the number of search results, etc. p  pNote, the sidebar for example needs to be manipulated quite a bit based on user actions. Also, the other areas such as search results, can be manipulated and I would like to code these two areas of the app separately, using best practices. p

Negative 824 pI have asp.net mvc5 project hosted in Azure that is using SQL Azure for data persistence. Some tables in my database are like dictionaries, they are referenced by lots of tables, and very rarely changed.

I want to optimize and do not make SQL query to dictionary table to get id of some entity every time I want to insert this is not premature optimization, Azure may change some money per number of queries. p  pWhat is good approach to achieve that Currently I have DAOlike entity managers with static field that gets populated when object is constructed or explicitly called Refresh when dictionary data is updated via my asp.net mvc app. Each Manager caches entities from its own table.  It is like poor mans caching. I wonder is there a better way to do that Are there any patternslibrariestechniques to cache dictionarylike datap

Negative 824 pId like to geocode around 2M strings representing cities or states or countries of the whole world every day.  Theses strings are not very clean, you have to make distinction between Paris,France and Paris,TX for instance, but you have you also have to geocode Paris with the french city  thats why Im looking to use GMaps API or OSM Nominatim API.p  pThe brute force solution would be to dump OSM data on my computer and process it locally, but I hope I can find an easier way to do it.p  pObviously, I can reduce the amount of strings to be geocoded, store the results not to have to query twice a string, but I would still have hundred thousands strings to geocode...p  pThanks p

Negative 824 pI have a strange issue when i try create an eventhandler in the run block. It is a bit hard to explain the issue, partly becaues I dont understand whats happening but I will do my best. Its written in typescript.p  pI have the following runblockp  precodeangular.modulemyapp   .runrootScope, StateChangeStartHandler gt      rootScope.onstateChangeStart, StateChangeStartHandler.handler    codepre  pStateChangeStartHandler is a simple angular service with a function called handler which is meant to handle the stateChangeStart event.

Negative 824 pIm trying to understand how callback functions work properly by solving this problemp  blockquote   pComplete the following merge function such that is behaves as   described in the example below. Merge should take two arrays of   numbers of identical length and a callback function.p blockquote  precodevar merge  functionarray1, array2, callback     your code here.   var x  merge[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8], functiona, b     return a  b   x should now equal [6, 8, 10, 12]. codepre  blockquote   pNow, use your merge function to complete the euclid function defined   below. Euclid should take two arrays, each of which has an equal   number of numerical elements, and return the euclidean distance   between them. For a quick refresher on what Euclidean distance is,   check herep blockquote  precodevar euclid  functioncoords1, coords2     Your code here.   You should not use any loops and should   instead use your original merge function.   var x  euclid[1.2, 3.67], [2.0, 4.4]  x should now equal approximately 1.08. codepre  pIm able to do this without callbacks, but ultimately I want to know how to complete a function like this using callback as a parameter.p

Negative 824 pI want to create an app which is just a simple form. Im planning to first create it using bootstrap and then convert it into an android app hopefully using Framework7. Now, I need to capture the data entered in the app and save it to a CRM system. All CRM systems Ive seen come with their own custom apps.p  pI was wondering if there is any free CRM system which will integrate nicely and easily, something like just a form submit or like an iframe integration. Is this possible at all If not, can you suggest alternatives to this approachp
Negative 824 pIm working on a web app and I have to design its database. Theres a part that didnt come very straightforward to me, so after some thinking and research I came with multiple ideas. Still neither seems completely suitable, so Im not sure which one to implement and why.p  pThe simplified problem looks as follows I have a table Teacher. There are 2 types of teachers, according to the relations with their Fields and Subjectsp  ol liA Teacher thats related to a Field, the Field is obligatory related to a Category li liA Teacher thats not related to a Field, but directly to a Categoryli ol  pMy initial idea was to have two nullable foreign keys, one to the table Field, and the other to the table Category. But in this case, how can I make sure that exactly one is null, and the other one is notp  pThe other idea is to create a hierarchy, with two types of Teacher tables derived from the table Teacher isa relation, but I couldnt find any useful tutorial on this.p  pIm developing the app using Django with SQLite dbp

Negative 824 phere is a small client GUI program written in c. The idea is first the client will send an id typed in the textboxto serverpressing the check button, the server will check that id and if its valid the server will return a value 0 otherwise 1. Now if the return value is 1, then the client will again take an input in the checkbox and send it to the server for another checkby pressing the check button. This process will go on until the client receives a 0 from the server. But, In my code, when I make an invalid input in the textbox, it hangs as well as the check button. So, I cant repeat the proces of sending a valid id to server.
