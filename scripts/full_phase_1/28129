Negative 28129 pI have an asp.net application developed. It uses LINQ to SQL to access database, using the .dbml designer in Visual Studio 2008. We are installing the application on client, and they have decided to change the database name on their servers. Now, the application does not work because LINQ cant find the database information. This is not an issue with the connection strings, but with the files generated by the .dmbl designer. I suppose we have some options 1. Change the development database name to match the clients name, regenerate de dbml, recompile, and send the application again to client. 2. Install VS2008 on client and make the necessary modifications there.p  pNone of the options seem really good. This is not the end of the world, but it is a real pain.

Negative 28129 pGiven that Solid State Disks SSDs are decreasing in price and soon will become more prevalent as system drives, and given that their access rates are significantly higher than rotating magnetic media, what standard algorithms will gain in performance from the use of SSDs for local storage  For example, the high random read speed of SSDs makes something like a diskbased hashtable a viability for large hashstables 4GB of disk space is readily available, which makes hashing to the entire range of a 32bit integer viable more for lookup than population, though, which would still take a long time while this size of a hashtable would be prohibitive to work with with rotating media due to the access speed, it shouldnt be as much of an issue with SSDs.p  pAre there any other areas where the impending transition to SSDs will provide potential gains in algorithmic performance  Id rather see reasoning as to how one thing will work rather than opinion I dont want this to turn contentious.p

The app allows users to upload files.  Depending on what the file is it is copied to one of several possible directories.p  pTo save and restore the state of the app those directories need to be copied somewhere, the tests run, then the directories need to have their files deleted and retreived from the backup.p  pThe location of these directories can vary from one machine to another and I know that some people put them outside of the web app.  There is a configuration file that can be read by the test that gives the location of those directories for the given machine.p  pIf I dont restrict all these directories to a specific dir tree its difficult to do the jailing.  If I do restrict these directories to a specific dir tree then some people will have to reconfigure their machines.p

Negative 28129 pI made some ajax sites in the past where I used ajax to get more of a desktop application feeling for my sites and also to keep the site maintainable. My strategy was making one index page and from there pulling in html content from some subpages. So far I didnt use ajax to send data to the server.p  pThe problem that I ran into is this I want the subpages to be readable by google since they contain valuable content but once they show up in googles results they lead to the naked htmlfile no css nor Javascript. I solved this by putting a javascript redirect window.location  ... on the subpages so they lead to the correct page.p  pSo as an example lets say I have a site at example.com with some javascript and css and a naked content page that should be loaded via ajax example.comcontent.html. Via ajax I pull in what I need from the content file but since my index.html contains hrefs to the content.html file I want the content of my ajax site to be readable without Javascript it will be indexed by google and gets listed in the search results. But I dont want people to see the naked html file. Hence the redirect that goes to the index page and gets handled by some Javascript to show the content as I want it to be showed.p  pI was wondering if there are nicer solutions to this problem or different approaches.p

Negative 28129 pThis might be a subjective question, but Ill give it a go.p  pThere are already a number of questions on SO that revolves around subscription billing management. I am currently working on a SaaS solution that will require a fully automated billing system.p  pWhat I am not looking for when asking this question is not advice on implementing towards a specific payment gateway or stuff like that. Instead Id like advice on what kind of approach to take.p  pThe functionality that I need is a system that can handle upgrades, downgrades, recurring billing, cancellations, etc. Initially for one product only, but it might over time be a requirement that the system can handle multiple products by products I mean fundamentally different products, not different variations of the same product.p  pAs I see it there are a number of possible approaches when you need a solution like thisp  ol listrongCode a billing server yourselfstrong that supports this and is decoupled from each product so that it can handle multiple independent products.li listrongUse a hosted solutionstrong like a hrefhttprecurly.comRecurlya, a hrefhttpchargify.comChargifya, a hrefhttpspreedly.comSpreedlya or a hrefhttpcheddargetter.comCheddarGettera.li ol  pThe advantage of using a hosted solution is obviously that you dont need PCI certification, the concern is outsourced and it is a lot faster to get up and running. These advantages come at a cost however The most important support function for your product  i.e. the billing is not in your control. Additionally you have less control and flexibility.p  pWhat would you do If we look beyond the PCI requirements I would definately prefer to have a system coded inhouse that could do this kind of job. On the other hand Ive heard from numerous sources that coding a system like this is a pain.p  pAny advice is highly appreciated. Also, if you advice to code it yourself, any experiences on how to do it or if there are any opensource projects no matter the language, what Im after is not the code but the structure that I can benefit from would really mean alot.p

Negative 28129 pI have an application built with the MinGW C compiler that works something like grep   acommand looks something like thisp  precodemyapp e . .txt codepre  pwhere the thing that comes after the e switch is a regex, and the thing after that is file name pattern. It seems that MinGW automatically expands globs in UNIX terms the command line so my regex gets mangled. I can turn this behaviour off, I discovered, by setting the global variable codeCRTglobcode to zero. This will be fine for bash and other sensible shell users, as the shell will expand the file pattern. For MS codecmd.execode users however, it looks like I will have to expand the file pattern myself.p  pSo my question  does anyone know of a globbing library or facility in MinGW to do strongpartialstrong command line expansion  Im aware of the setargv feature of the Windows CRT, but that expands the full command line. Please note Ive seen a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1269480globbingincconwindowsthis questiona, but it really does not address partial expansion.p  pIve ended up using conditional compilation to write my own globbing code for the Windows version of my app. This was pretty easy as I have my own CommandLine class which encapsulates argc and argv from main. Still, Id be interested to hear of other solutions.p

Negative 28129 pThis question has been asked before and there have been windowsspecific answers but no satisfactory gcc answer. I can use codesetterminatecode to set a function that will be called in place of codeterminatecode when an unhandled exception is thrown. I know how to use the backtrace library to generate a stack trace from a given point in the program. However, this wont help when my terminatereplacement is called since at that point the stack has been unwound. p  pYet if I simply allow the program to codeabortcode, it will produce a coredump which contains the full stack information from the point at which the exception was thrown.  So the information is there  but is there a programmatic way to get it, for example so it can be logged, rather than having to examine a core filep

Negative 28129 pIm currently using the A pathfinding algorithm to calculate a path on an infinite grid using an UnboundedGrid in Gridworld, the AP CS case study, if that helps anyone. Everything works wonderfully, except for cases where no valid path exists because the end node is completely surrounded by walls. As expected, the algorithm continues searching infinitely, never finding the end node.p  pA possible solution to this would be to place invisible as in, the user doesnt see them but the algorithm does walls around the entire pathfinding area, making sure the start node, end node, and all the wall nodes are within these walls, with 23 spaces padding or so. Something likep  precode                                               S                                                           E                                   codepre  p...the idea being that eventually all the nodes will be added to the closedlist, the openlist will become empty, and at that point Ill know that no valid path exists.p  pDoes this seem like a reasonable solution to the problem Are there any ways in which this could potentially go wrong I understand that another solution is to simultaneously pathfind backwards from the end, but this seems like it could be potentially expensive, particularly in cases where the end node isnt so tightly enclosed.p

Negative 28129 pIm running into a deadlock scenario when using MySQL and Hibernate with Spring.

Essentially I see two transactions where one is trying to select a row from a table while the other is trying to update that row. The table in contention here is my unique id table. I have a common, root object which other Entity objects extend. This root object defines the id property and is annotated with Id, TableGenerator and GeneratedValue.p  pSome digging around led me to believe that setting the LockMode to UPGRADE for the select on that table might help andor changing the select so that instead of it using select .... strongfor updatestrong it would use select .... stronglock in share modestrong.p  pAny ideas if setting the Lockmode.upgrade would really help or changing for update to lock in share mode Secondly, how would I do this with spring  hibernate...I was leaning towards implementing a custom LoadEventListener which would extend the DefaultLoadEventListener.p

Negative 28129 pI am using the codeDisplay.getRotationcode method to determine the current orientation of the screen in my App, per this helpful blog entry from Googlep  pa hrefhttpandroiddevelopers.blogspot.com201009onescreenturndeservesanother.html relnofollowhttpandroiddevelopers.blogspot.com201009onescreenturndeservesanother.htmlap  pIn a nutshell, I have a drawing app that allows the user to draw shapes, etc to the screen, and the drawing canvas needs to stay in the same orientation, but I still wanted to the Options menu, etc to flip to the correct location if and when the user starts drawing with the device in a different orientation.p  pIn codeonDrawcode for the canvas, I request the orientation from codegetRotationcode and then rotate the canvas back to the 0 location so that from the endusers perspective, the canvas never moves.  Works like a charm emEXCEPTem if the user flips the device emVERYem quickly... then codegetRotationcode reports a rotation of 0, and thus the canvas doesnt rotate back, making the drawing appear flipped or turned.p  pInterestingly, the title bar and options menus do flip... so not sure where they are getting the orientation from.

If the image is too big, then it will be position on the corners or the top and bottom bars of the window. If it is not too big, it will float next to the mouse position.p  pThe logic behind it i understand, but the actually coding seems to be a bit daunting.

Negative 28129 pstrongSorry, bit long, but it is a bit involved...strongp  pSwingWorker works entirely as expected in my app, except for one knotty problem which Im struggling to solve, in the event that chunks arrive in process coalesced, as the API clearly states is perfectly possible and normal.p  pThe problem comes, for example, when I have a JDialog which starts by saying task happening, please wait so a chunk is published in codedoInBackgroundcode which then arrives in codeprocesscode and sets up a JDialog.p  pWhen the lengthy task in doInBackground has finished I publish 2 more commands one says change the message of the JDialog to waiting for GUI to update, and the other says populate the JTable with the results Im sending you.p  pThe point about this is that, if you are sending a JTable a large amount of new data to replace its TableModels vector, Swing can actually take a nonnegligible time to udpate itself... for that reason I want to tell the user the lengthy task has finished, but were now waiting for Swing to update the GUI.p  pWhat is strange is that if these two instructions arrive as 2 coalesced chunks I find that the JDialog is only capable of being partially updated setTitle blab  results in the JDialogs title being changed... but all other changes to the JDialog are put on hold ... until the main GUI update of the JTable has finished.p  pIf I engineer things so that there is a slight delay in doInBackground between publishing the chunks the JDialog updates OK.  Obviously, with coalesced chunks I am using a loop to go through them one by one, so I thought of putting a Timer at the end of each loop.  This had no effect.p  pIve also tried innumerable permutations of validate and paint and repaint on the JDialog.p  pThe question therefore is how get I get the GUI to update itself within process between iterations dealing with coalesced chunks.p  pNB I also tried something else republishing chunks if they are multiple.  The trouble with this is that, given the asynchronous nature of things, it can result in chunks being published in the wrong order, as back in doInBackground, inevitably, things are continuing to be published.  Plus, this kind of solution is just inelegant.p  pstronglater... as requested, here is an SSCCEstrongp  precodeimport javax.swing. import javax.swing.table. import java.awt. import java.util.   class Coalescence extends SwingWorkerltObject, Objectgt      int DISPLAYWAITFORTASK  0 int DISPLAYWAITFORGUIUPDATE  1 int UPDATETABLEINGUI  2 int SETUPGUI  3      private Object[][] mdataTable      private JTable mtable     private JFrame mframe     private JOptionPane mpane     private JDialog mjDialog     private FontMetrics mfontMetrics      private Dimension mintercellSpacing      Override   protected Object doInBackground throws Exception          publish SETUPGUI          publish DISPLAYWAITFORTASK          Random rand  new Random         String s  String for display, one two three four five six seven eight         mdataTable  new Object[ 20000 ][]          for int i  0 i lt 20000 i              Object[] row  new Object[ 20 ]             for int j  0 j lt 20 j                   random length string  so column width computation has something to do...                 int endIndex  rand.nextInt 40                  row[ j ]  s.substring 0, endIndex                          mdataTable[ i ]  row              slow the lengthy nonEDT task artificially for sake of SSCCE             if i  10  0                  Thread.sleep 1L                    publish DISPLAYWAITFORGUIUPDATE             LINE TO COMMENT OUT          Thread.sleep 100L           publish UPDATETABLEINGUI           return null           protected void process java.util.ListltObjectgt chunks         p no chunks   chunks.size            CHUNK PROCESSING LOOP         for int i  0, nchunks  chunks.size i lt nchunks i              int value  Integerchunks.get i               p processing chunk   value               if value  SETUPGUI                  mframe  new JFrame                 mframe.setPreferredSize new Dimension 800, 400                  mframe.setVisible true                  JScrollPane jsp  new JScrollPane                 jsp.setBounds 10, 10, 600, 300                  mframe.getContentPane.setLayout null                  mframe.getContentPane.add jsp                  mtable  new JTable                 jsp.setViewportView mtable                  mframe.pack             mfontMetrics  mtable.getFontMetrics mtable.getFont              mintercellSpacing  mtable.getIntercellSpacing                          else if value  DISPLAYWAITFORTASK          mpane  new JOptionPane Waiting for results...

Negative 28129 pIm using Jasmine to write my tests, but I guess Id have this problem with any other testing framework. Lets say that we have a module codefoocode with two functions, codeBarcode and codeBazcode, which are constructors but could be just normal functionsp  precodevar Bar  exports.Bar  function Bar    this.baz  new Baz   var Baz  exports.Baz  function Baz    codepre  pNow I would like to test codeBarcode, but with a fake codeBazcode implementationp  precodevar foo  requirefoo  describefoo.Bar, function    itinitializes its own Baz, function      spyOnfoo, Baz  this replaces foo.Baz with a fake implementation     var bar  new foo.Bar     expectfoo.Baz.toHaveBeenCalled     codepre  pThe problem is that this test will fail, because codeBarcode instantiates a new codeBazcode using the variable codeBazcode, which cannot be changed from outside. The only thing that got swapped by using codespyOncode is codeexports.Bazcode.p  pThe obvious solution is to write codethis.baz  new exports.Bazcode but it kind of feels awkward. If I have more functions which I want to use inside my module, I would have to always call all of them using the codeexports.code prefix. Is there any other approach herep

This can be most easily achieved by only   performing imports from nondaemon threads created through the   threading module.

Negative 28129 pIm playing around a bit and trying to get some things to work for a later project, but I have a problem that I cant seem to find a solution to.p  pRight now I have working and accurate collision detection, but the problem is creating the physics. The physics are simple right now, an object has a vector for its direction and speed, when there is a collision the vector is inverted.p  pThe problem is that when objects collide they get shoved into each other and end up inverting the vector forever causing strange results. E.g. magically floating upwards, or appearing to ignore the physics entirely.p  pCould anyone help me out p  pEDIT Detection is done by separating axis theorem and I didnt put code because all that really goes on is there is a loop to check for collisions, when one is found the vectors are inverted. Like I said, the actual detection works fine, I think my problem is as Sibbo said with moving the objects so they dont collide anymore.p

Heres what I mean in codep  precodefrom StringIO import StringIO from avro.datafile import DataFileWriter from avro import schema, io from testdata import BEARER, PUBLISHURL, SERVER, TESTDATA from httplib2 import Http  HTTP  Http   Write the message data to a StringIO   return StringIO  def writedata     message  TESTDATA     schema  getSchema     datumwriter  io.DatumWriterschema     data  StringIO     with DataFileWriterdata, datumwriter, writersschemaschema, codecdeflate as datafilewriter         datafilewriter.appendmessage          If I return data inside the with block, the DFW buffer isnt flushed          and I may get an incomplete file     return data    Make the POST and dump its response  def main     headers           ContentType avrobinary,         Authorization Bearer s  BEARER,         XXCSCHEMAVERSION 1.0.0,          body  writedata.getvalue  AttributeError StringIO instance has no attribute buf      the StringIO instance returned by writedata is already closed.      resp, content  HTTP.request         uriPUBLISHURL,         methodPOST,         bodybody,         headersheaders,          print resp, content codepre  pI do have some workarounds I can use, but none of them are terribly elegant. Is there any way to get the data from the StringIO after its closedp

Negative 28129 pIm developing an application with MVC3 and Entity Framework. I have service layers for two entities that have one similarity.p  pThe two services are DurationService and FieldService. The former handles a list of Days and daysettings. These settings contain information about the timeslots per day start time, end time, a list of possible break times. The latter service handles a list of Fields and fieldsettings. These fieldsettings are used to determine the field availability.p  pBoth services need to check whether the break times overlap. I coded this for the DurationService but have now noticed that the FieldService requires exactly the same method. I dont want to violate the DRY principle so my question is, how do I best handle thisp  pDo I make a static class which both services can call Do I use some kind of inheritance even though this method is the only method they will share.p

The matter of Versioning in JCR 2.0 JSR283 it leaves me wondering, how would one conduct JCR versioning  operations via HTTPp  pIn more detail Im looking at what I presume would be a hrefhttpwww.day.comspecsjcr2.015Versioning.html relnofollowsection 15 of JSR283, served up in HTML format from Adobe.a In that section, JSR283 presents a concept of versioning for JCR nodes. p  pI understand, then, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3943609jcrcheckincheckoutoperationsthat theres a VersionManager APIa in JSR283 compatible releases of Jackrabbit. That serves to explain how one would conduct JCR JSR283 versioning operations via the API. So, but how can a user agent conduct a versioning operation via DAV p  pId like to answer that one for myself, but I dont even know where to start. p  pIs there another part of JSR283 explaining how the version checkincheckout operations translate into HTTP requests  Is it a matter of simple DAV properties Am I even close to the mark, at thatp  pPeer review needed, lolp

Negative 28129 pIve looked all over the place for a good way to bind XML elements to Java classes.

Negative 28129 pIve created a numbers to words converter for 0999 and have almost got it working perfectly apart from one bug.p  pIn certain numbers over a hundred there is a space missing between the hundred section and the tensunits section.p  pFor example 864 gives eth canspajar ha tri ugens where there needs to be a space between the cans and the pajar hundred  cansp  pIt seems to be a regular problem because it happens to 164, 264, 364, etc, and ranges of other numbers.p  pCan anyone with a better knowledge of Javascript or maths take a look at my code and see if they can spot the pattern, or a solution The code is taken from a French number converter which I didnt make and Im relatively new to Javascript so its tricky for me to completely understand everything thats there.p  pYou can

The issue is When I try and run the application for real.  p  pIve had to remove this constructor, and only leave a simple 0 parameter constructor so that Structuremap can create the object context at runtime, and hence can not do any schema mapping.p  pBecause the Web project has no reference to the Data Layer, and hence knows nothing about the ICLObjectContext, how do I tell structuremap, via some configuration, I want to create a new dictionary with mapping schema x to schema y, p  pThe service layer has a reference to the data layer, so Im guessing I need to do it in there, since the web project, can reference the service layer.p  pWould this be about right Meh Ive just got myself sort of caught up and cant see a way out.p  pThanksp

Negative 28129 pWe have a frame model and lots of components in it. On nearly each frame codeUpdatecode function of nearly each component is called by Frame model controller say Unity3d and all that happens, takes place in one thread. We have components that are codeTargetscode that change some of there properties for example position and want to tall other components  codeConsumerscode for example missiles about that fact. p  pIf we use normal C event model and raise events from codeTargetscode we will get really long codeUpdatecode call. One that can freeze all our frame based app. So we can not really use C events as much as we would like.p  pWhat have we done for each codeConsumercode component we subscribe to codeTargetscode events with actions that push all new data into a List and on codeComponentcode Update call we iterate thru list of new data and make our update.p  pSo my question is is there a way to generealise such approach say if we have not only want targets to affect our missiles but also codewindscode with there own incoming data for example direction and temprature to make code look nicep  pIs ther any more correct way of sending events in frame modelp

Negative 28129 pI think it would be very comfortable to use the users password hash as the secret for generating a hmac. Why is OAuth and others using tokens and noncesp  pI think of something like thisp  pClient enters a password in the ui. The application registers with the webservice using the hash of that password, which is stored on the server. Form now on that hash hasnt to be transmitted again. The client can always regenerate the secret by asking the user to enter the password and hashing it. Every message is signed with this hash, the server can look it up by username or guid and check if the sent mac is valid.p  pA intruder on the server can get that hash, but doesnt know the users real password, anyway he could send valid request with that hash. But this is not likely to happen, the saved hashes could also be hashed again using a nonce. Anyway because the pwdfile will be on a clients server it should be obfuscated using e.g. base64 to avoid the file looking like passworda4bd146hashhashhash.p  pMost of all the real password of the user wont ever be transmitted. The requests will be secured with a timestamptoken against replay I recognize the purpose of the token here.p  pSending a hash would be perfectly applicable for me because the client will never be a simple website with a  tag e.g.. The webservice will be used in a ajaxbased application and a java desktop application, both of them capable of hashing strings...p  pWhats wrong with that Its so simple, more RESTFul than anything related to authentication, and i think yet effective.

Negative 28129 pI notice this as a frequent problem on emmanyem wbesites, even those of large corporations, so as a web developer applying for jobs, I think, emI should know how to fix this.emp  pBasically, for example, a username field will say Username until you click it to type in your username, at which time it should clear itself of the text Username. But in most cases, it doesnt, and you end up typing in the middle of that preexisting text.p  pIve looked this up, and the best solution I found was a 30 line set of Javascript functions which did exactly what youd expect set up a system that clears the default value away when a user clicks on the field, and also puts it back when they click away so long as they hadnt entered anything.p  pBut thats not really what I was looking for, because I already knew how to do that.p  pI feel like by now, with HTML5 and all, there should be a simpler fix to this. And not just a reduction of the JavaScript to a shorter jQuery script. I mean more of an embedded, inherent fix.p  pDoes anyone know of any ways to stop this phenomenon from happeningp

Negative 28129 pIm working on a project where we recently have changed our persistence provider from using OpenJPA to use EclipseLink. This is a big and old application where we also do SQL inserts from other processes that are currently not feasible to migrate to JPA in the time being.p  pWe use emTableGeneratorem to reference a table where we keep track of the ids to use on inserts.p  pWhen we used OpenJPA, we noticed that it first selects next id from the table, then it updates table to preallocate next ids. This is exactly the same way the old SQL process gets and preallocates next ids.p  pWhen we switched to EclipseLink, we noticed the opposite behavior, it Updates the table to preallocate next ids, and then begin doing inserts. This is causing us a strongjava.sql.SQLIntegrityConstraintViolationExceptionstrong because the last preallocated id has been used by the nonJPA processes to insert a new record, so when the JPA process reaches that id, the database gives an error, claiming that we are trying to do an insert with an id already used.p  pIs there a way to tell EclipseLink to handle preallocation the way OpenJPA doesp  pHere are some samples of the preallocation strategy from OpenJPA vs EclipseLink, for these examples I have set the emallocationSizeem to 5p  pstrongOpenJPAstrongp  precodeTEST  TRACE  [main] openjpa.jdbc.SQL  ltt 22760146, conn 3658896gt executing prepstmnt 9137209 SELECT NEXTID FROM ABC.tableids WHERE TABLEID   FOR UPDATE [paramsString 1034] [reused0] TEST  TRACE  [main] openjpa.jdbc.SQL  ltt 22760146, conn 3658896gt [94 ms] spent TEST  TRACE  [main] openjpa.jdbc.SQL  ltt 22760146, conn 3658896gt executing prepstmnt 23999306 UPDATE ABC.tableids SET NEXTID   WHERE TABLEID   AND NEXTID   [paramslong 55, String 10, long 50] [reused0] TEST  TRACE  [main] openjpa.jdbc.SQL  ltt 22760146, conn 3658896gt [93 ms] spent codepre  pstrongEclipseLinkstrongp  precode[EL Fine] 20130123 140835.875ClientSession6215763Connection10098848ThreadThread[main,5,main]UPDATE tableids SET nextid  nextid   WHERE tableid            bind gt [5, 10]  [EL Fine] 20130123 140836.0ClientSession6215763Connection10098848ThreadThread[main,5,main]SELECT nextid FROM tableids WHERE tableid            bind gt [10] codepre  pThanks in advancep

Negative 28129 pI am importing data from an Oracle DB that is neither made nor administered by myself.p  pThere might be some BLOB fields in that data.p  pAssuming that the field title is not a good description for the fields contents and that there is no blobtype field, is there anyway to know or guess what kind of binary data is being storedp  pBasically, how do I tell the difference between an image stored in a BLOB field versus perhaps a large amount of text.p  pI suppose this is less of an Oracle BLOB thing and more of a how do I parse and interpret binary data with no prior info thing.p  pI apologize, this is either a strange question or a rather silly one and the answer is probably No, but I figured Id ask anyway.p  pIf it helps, I plan to use cxOracle with Python to do the import, though I doubt thats relevant.p  pThanks for your time, have a good day.p

Negative 28129 pI am using XSL for XML transformation and I need to use this transformation from a web service project. For transformation Im using precompiling facility of IBM XML. Following is hoe precompiling is done. p  precode            XFactory factory  XFactory.newInstance       Get the compilation factory      Factory for compiling expressions, queries and stylesheets into Java      classes.     XCompilationFactory compileFactory  factory.getCompilationFactory       Create the compilation parameters      Interface for compilation parameter settings     XCompilationParameters params  compileFactory.newCompilationParametersxsltFileName     params.setPackageNamepackageName     params.setDirectoryNamebin     StreamSource source  new StreamSourcenew FilefilePath       Generate the compiled classes     boolean flag  compileFactory.compileXSLTsource, params codepre  pAbove code compiles xslt files and put them into codebincode directory. What IBM XML transformation create from precompiling is bunch of class files. codeReason why I use bin here is its in the classpathcode. Then I can use precompiled xslt files in bin folder and do my transformation efficiently as follows.p  precode    StreamResult output  null     StreamSource transformedSource  null       Create the factory XFactory factory  XFactory.newInstance   Get the compilation factory XCompilationFactory compileFactory  factory.getCompilationFactory       Create the compilation parameters XCompilationParameters params  compileFactory.newCompilationParametersfileName params.setPackageNamepackageName   Load the executable XSLTExecutable executable  compileFactory.loadXSLTparams StringWriter strWriter  new StringWriter output  new StreamResultstrWriter  executable.executesource, output  Execute the transformation. Check                                          The output for result.   Prepare a new Source to return Reader reader  new StringReaderstrWriter.getBuffer.toString  transformedSource  new StreamSourcereader codepre  pAnother this I need to mention is for above transformation I need to read some external XML filesas lookups from XSL. I read them using xsl codeDocumentcode function as follows.p  precodeltxslvariable namebooleanLookupDoc     selectdocument..LookupsBooleanLookup.xml gt codepre  pHere the path is given relative to the XSL file. Though above path is relative to XSL file after precompiling and putting class files to bin directory it works find and it can find those lookup files. p  pThe problem occurs when I include this project to the web service project. For web service project I include above transformation project.Using eclipse I add whole transformation project into web service project. When I precompile and run web service in a one computer this works fine. But When I create the EAR fileWebSphear deployment file and deploy in another machine XSL produce a error saying it cannot find Lookup XML files. By a reverse engineering tool we learn that precomiled class files contain path for XMLs as LookupsBooleanLookup.xml. We tried putting Lookup directory just inside WEBINF, WebContent folder, inside classes folder etc. Nothing worked. p  pIf some one can give me a clue regarding making these XML files visible for precompiled files itll be a great help. p

Negative 28129 pIm currently working on an API that accepts a large batch of data and performs a few different kinds of analysis on the data. Rather than forcing clients to pass in their data once for each sort of analysis they wish to perform, I thought it would make sense to offer just one API call and have that call accept the data and a list of actions i.e., analysis types to perform. This means that my API isnt RESTful, right Ill lose some clarity of function this way, but the gains in processing time will easily make up for that.p  pMy question is about how the requests should be formatted in JSON. If the client just needed to POST an array of data elements and an array of actions to perform, then formatting would be easy. Unfortunately, a few of the analysis types have options that need to be set.

Negative 28129 pThis question is for a project and nothing to do with homeworksacads. I am a working statistician. So my question is, how would you write a R function, given a matrix with 400 rows and two columns where every 20 rows starting from the first, form a first row of coordinates in a grid of points like below where I would like the function to return the four corners of each individual squarerectangle within the gridp  pHence the output would have four columns and each row would indicate a rectangle. I am only looking at adjacent rectangles of the same size as in  for example if the numbers below denote the row indices of the example matrix which has two columnsp  pExample of row indicesp  precode1  2  3 4  5  6 7  8  9 codepre  pWould have to be traversed in the following orderp  precode[1,2,4,5],[2,3,5,6],[4,5,7,8],[5,6,8,9] and codepre  preturn the corresponding 2d points  from the example input data set  which would have 9 rows and 2 points. But just that, here the grid is specified to be 3 by 3 while in my example the grid is 20 by 20 and my input dataset is 400 rows by 2 columns. If you look at the traversed result there is a pattern wherethe row indices in each 4 point block are incremented by 1. i just want to generalize this to a 400 by 2 or any setting  where there is a 2 column matrix of points and there is a mention of the grid dimension.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comFPSqz.png altenter image description herep

Shouldnt the vectorized version be faster since it can call defaultNoise three at a time, and can also do the multiplications at the same timep  pIf its relevant, defaultNoisex,z does thisp  precodefloat PerlinHeightMapGeneratordefaultNoiseint x, int z      int n  x  z  57     n  nltlt13  n     return staticcastltfloatgt 1.0f   n  n  n  15731  789221  1376312589 amp 0x7fffffff  1073741824.0f   codepre  pEDIT  I have tried some more tests with results I dont understand. First, I tried changing it so the vectorized function takes an array of 9 floats and then copies them to vectors in the function does nothing.p  pI then tried changing the code to see what happens if none of the kernel vectors are actually used.  First, replacing all instances of kernel to XMVectorSet1, 2, 3, 4 so the code isp  precodeconst XMVECTOR top  XMVector3DotXMVectorSetdefaultNoisex  1, z  1, defaultNoisex, z  1, defaultNoisex  1, z 1, 0, XMVectorSet1, 2, 3, 4     const XMVECTOR middle  XMVector3DotXMVectorSetdefaultNoisex  1, z, defaultNoisex, z, defaultNoisex  1, z, 0, XMVectorSet1, 2, 3, 4     const XMVECTOR bottom  XMVector3DotXMVectorSetdefaultNoisex  1, z  1, defaultNoisex, z  1, defaultNoisex  1, z  1, 0, XMVectorSet1, 2, 3, 4 codepre  pThis cut the execution time of the program from 4 seconds to less than 2 seconds 50 reduction.p  pI then tried replacing the first XMVectorSet1, 2, 3, 4 back with kernel[0], and this increased the execution time to about 2100 milliseconds.  Replacing the second XMVectorSet1, 2, 3, 4 with kernel[1] increased the time to 2700 milliseconds  replacing the final, third vector brought the time back up to 4 seconds.p  pI tried also copying the floats to the vectors inside the function instead of before it is called, and the result is the same.p  pEDIT 2  It appears XMVectorSet1, 2, 3, 4 is a special case.   Maybe its faster because its 4 ints replacing it with XMVectorSet.0357143f, 0.0714286f, 0.0357143f, 0 slows it back down to the original speed.p  pI still dont understand why the vectorized version is slower, though.p
Negative 28129 pI have just found out that compression has been added to WCF, supporting emDeflateem and emGZipem compression schemes. The documentation seems very vague on the operation details.p  pI was wondering if someone has detailed information on how the compression works. p  pIs it done on a permessage basis emeach message is handled and compressed independently of the previous messagesem  Or perhaps it is done strongemor can be configuredemstrong in an adaptive fashion emthe next message takes advantage of compressibility information gathered from the previous onesemp  pBasically I would like to know if enabling this new compression feature can benefit a chatty application that transmits small chunks of realtime data that is known to be VERY compressible if grouped, but compresses VERY poorly if handled in isolation. The realtime constraint unfortunately doesnt allow us grouping several messages to aid the compression process.p

Negative 28129 pI have had to write a plugin for phonegap to perform push notification registration for windowsphone.

While trying to create a plugin.xml file for this I noticed the following in the documentationp  precode As with assets, if the target of a sourcefile would overwrite an existing file, plugman stops and reverses the installation, issues a notification about the problem, and exits with a nonzero code.  codepre  pSo the question becomes  Either br How can I force phonegapplugman to overwrite an existing cs filebr How can I edit an existing cs file through plugin.cs in the same way as with xml filesbr or failing these br How can I access OnNavigatedTo from my plugin that does not extend PhoneApplicationPagebr How can I add a new default mainpage by only editing xml hr Ok, I think Ive partially figured out this last question ... Couldnt find a way to force phonegapplugman, but just writing the question How can I add a new default mainpage made me go back and look at it again.  I can add a new page fine and can edit WMAppManifest.xml to change the DefaultTask to my new page.

Can I edit an existing node with plugin.xmlp  pThanks in advance.p

I dont think my tables talk to each other outside of PHP...p  pAnother example why I might need techniques like that are for general DB administration and maintenance. Also strongly determined by the fact that my app is growing, and while I am BETA testing it, I may have to change stuff around, have to do some bulk edits to the data, which I would much rather do with an atomized function FOR, WHILE, etc. then to click into each field and change it manually.p  pHope this makes more sense now.p  pAside from that Hey, even if it brakes my stuff, I just wanna know how to get it to work. How to run code in mySQL.  Again I could simply write this up in PHP, switching back and forth between PHP code and DB queries, but since SQL seems to offer programming commands, why not use those and save the hassle of uploading and debugging PHP scripts, and simply punch in the code directly into phpMyAdmin... Think of a different example, if you like Dp

Negative 28129 pIm a RoR newbie v3.2.13, and Im building a new siteapplication that has a lot of landing pages, divided into 68 different layouts. The layouts are using similar elements in a changing order, so Im using partials and layout inheritance to render each page appropriately.p  pMy problem is that my forms located at the top of each page are also inconsistent for example, while one page might only have a name and email fields, another will contain an additional phone field, a third one might also include a password, address and country fields, etc., and building a different partial for each page seems like a very prodigal approach, DRY wise, not to mention how ineffective it is, especially since I expect a vast amount of new pages in the future.p  pIve researched the forms concept thoroughly but have yet to come up with a solution that I deem good enough, probably due to me being a newbie. Unfortunately I dont have any code to present, since I waited until I make a decision regarding the optimal approach to start coding.p  pWhat I came up with so far is using jQuery and conditionals within Haml, which I understand are both naive approaches, while I read coding each field into its own partial would be considered an antipattern alternatively  NOT the Rails 3 way.p  pIs there a best practice pertaining to such design issues Are there any onlineother resources I missed that would point me in the right directionp  pThanksp

Negative 28129 pI am currently implementing my own codeLoadercode in Android, since I am using a library for loading stuff, that exposes its API only through callbacks and I still want to use the benefits of loaders. p  pThe library I want to use can take care of running asynchroneously itself or I can force it to  run synchroneously and do the threading myself. The Android documentation tells me the followingp  blockquote   pIntroduced in Android 3.0, loaders make it easy to asynchronously load   data in an activity or fragment. Loaders have these characteristicsp      p...p      ul   liThey provide asynchronous loading of data.li   ul      p...p blockquote  pThis I interpret as if a codeLoadercode always runs in its own Thread and performs the tasks asynchroneously.

Negative 28129 pIs there a way to send an email from iOS application without using MFMailCompose UI.p  pI need to send an email with a small 1.5mb video but using a custom UI. This is not an app that is going to end up in app store because its going to be in a kiosk environment. So I can use private APIs.p  pThe reason that I cannot use MFMailCompose is multipart.p  p1 UI is not customisable enough for my specific needs.p  p2 When you tap on EmailTo field and start typing it populates previously entered email addresses or email addresses in contacts list. Shown in Figure1. I need to get rid of this functionality.p  p3 You can also add additional emails from your contact list by tapping Plus Button at the end of the TextField which will again show you your contact list.Shown in Figure2. I need to get rid of this functionality too.p  pBut still, I would want to use the attaching video functionality that MFMailCompose provides and I dont want to use a web service to do this, as uploading these video onto some other servers maybe a privacy concern for many users.p  pIs there any private ios APIs that I can use to archive this. Use MFMailCompose functionality without the UI.p  pAny help is greatly appriciated.p  pFigure1   img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comstirH.png altenter image description herep  pFigure2   img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comI8uFB.png altenter image description herep

Negative 28129 pIm trying to understand the format of SNMP traps. Im porting a piece of code from windows to linux that sends SNMP traps. The windows code uses a built in library  some functions include SnmpStartup, SnmpSetRetransmitMode. Might be called WinSNMP , so there is no way to keep that code when porting to Linux.p  pI found a nice library called SNMP that has the ability to send SNMP traps easily.p  pFrom my understanding, the first two variable binding vb fields of an SNMP trap must meet a specific format. The first vb is the sysuptime basically, the timestamp of the trap, and it has the well known OID of code1.3.6.1.2.1.1.3.0code.p  pThe second vb is the ID of the trap. I cant find any documentation on it anywhere, but SNMP gives the ID of the trap an OID of code1.3.6.1.6.3.1.1.4.1.0code its value is the OID of the trap we are sending. It gets set using pdu.setnotifyid function. p  pIs this another well known OID that must be present when sending a Trap The windows library doesnt use this OID at all. It sets the OID of the ID field to the OID that we are sending, so the OID and its value are set to the same thing. It looks like it is being done manually though, so the format might not have been well understood by the original coder.p  pSo, which of these is correctp  precodewindows 1.3.6.1.4.1.XXXX.2.1.51 gt 1.3.6.1.4.1.XXXX.2.1.51  SNMP 1.3.6.1.6.3.1.1.4.1.0 gt 1.3.6.1.4.1.XXXX.2.1.51 codepre  pAnd why cant I find any documentation on this code1.3.6.1.6.3.1.1.4.1.0code value It doesnt seem to be in any RFCs that Ive read.

Negative 28129 pIs there a fast way to get the lowest valued partition key Im trying to create a table that is ordered by date. It will be for displaying reports on posts in an admin page. It cant be in an sql table because it has the potential to be billions of rows. I want each partition to represent a page and have 50 rows in it. Ill do some calculations to get the right partition. I think I may end up having some partition called pages with a blank row key and store the number of pages there. Using that Ill be able to get the partition key but if theres a built in way to do this Id like to use that. Im not too sure if I can make updating the pages partition while adding a new partition a transaction which could cause conflicts if things are added to the table quickly enough I doubt this would happen though since there wont be batch inserts. Is table storage even the best tool to do thisp

This is probably a hack fix. The professional fix may be in checking minX and display width and seeing why it fires the if statements there when its on the screen. Maybe it should be changed to this.centreX instead of this.minX. Those if statements are firing too often. Anyways commented out it works, I am happy with that for now. Thanks. p  pIm using this awesome library a hrefhttpscode.google.compandroidmultitouchcontroller relnofollowhttpscode.google.compandroidmultitouchcontrollera In particular, the PhotoSortrView class of the example app it provides. I provide enough code for anyone to try and help. p  pIt is working great. It enables my images to be dragged, rotated, and scaled, with touch gestures. However I am constantly leaving my activity that implements it, to choose new images, and then adding the images and reentering the activity. It seems as though it has to call onPause and onResume which have to call unloadImages and loadImages, otherwise it causes my app to crash because it tries to draw images that are null. However they cause the previous images to load in a different position on the screen each time. If I can either not call these so the images are not unloaded and just have a slower app but the images stay in their position, or reuse the image position and scale information so they reload into the same position each time, that would be great. Here is the code. When I say my activity, it is all one activity where this all takes place.

Negative 28129 pThis may sound too stupid but I have been going crazy for finding that out. I just need to know how to write codeXML in HTMLcode file so I can send it using codeAjaxcode.p  pI know how to send codeXMLcode using codeXMLHttpRequestcode after I have included external file but that is not what I am trying to do here. My XML file is really small like 3 tags. So I dont want to write external file for no reason. Please explain despite being good with Javascript,CSS, and HTML. I have very limited experince with XML.

Negative 28129 pSome background... I am writing code that interacts with javascript via a ObjCJS bridge utilizing codeUIWebViewcodes codestringByEvaluatingJavaScriptFromStringcode. The idea is that the brains of the app be in JS which tells ObjectiveC how to behave. There are multiple benefits to this like reduced binary size, flexible updates, etc. However, there is a case where there is some ObjectiveC only object that the JS needs to have a reference to JS instructs ObjC when to useremove the object. This is being done by placing the native object in a dictionary with a unique identifier which can be passed as a string to JS over the bridge. My problem stems with coming up with a nice identifier for said native ObjectiveC object.p  pThus, I am trying to convert a reference to an object to a string with no luck.

And since this supposed module is equipped with codePHPcode file, it would be easy for our Big Boss to access this separate report at home, whether he used his internetready Television or just his laptop.p  pAny suggestionp

Negative 28129 pBeen banging my head against a brick wall for sometime with this problem. Was hoping I may be able to get some help here.p  pBasically, my game has an inventory system with a number of different objects. There are different classes derived from the base class Object and they use virtual functions in order to have different behaviour with the same function call. p  pOriginally, I had a list inventory as well as a listiterator invIter. The iterator would call the functions I needed for the right object in the inventory but would only call base class functions. I read from another answer that the reason for this is because you lose the polymorphic nature when you do this but having a list of pointers would remedy it.p  pSo I changed the list and iterator so they were Object pointers and found out the supposedly correct way to access the functions and variables of the inventory objects. However, when these functions or variables get accessed at runtime, the program has an unhandled exception and breaks.p  pThis is my code which causes the issue....p  pHeaderp  precodeinclude Object.h include ltvectorgt include ltlistgt  using namespace std  class Player  public     Player      void addItemObject     void printInventory      listltObjectgt inventory  private         listltObjectgtiterator invIter         codepre  pcppp  precodeinclude Player.h include Object.h  include ltiostreamgt    PlayerPlayer     void PlayeraddItemObject newItem      inventory.pushbackampnewItem     return    void PlayerprintInventory      cout ltlt YOU ARE CARRYING n     forinvIterinventory.begin invIterinventory.end invIter                      cout ltlt invItergtgetName ltlt ,             cout ltlt nPRESS RETURN TO CONTINUE...     cin.ignore1     return  codepre  pAny help is much appreciated, Ive honestly hit a dead end myself.p

Negative 28129 pWhen is it strongemGOODemstrong to declare a global variable in JavaScript  Typical advice concerning global variables includesp  pI sometimes encounter situations where it is critical that the value of a variable is available for the duration of the activity of the user.  For example, knowing the state of which page is open.  Another situation is when there is a long process with lots of smaller functions, but some value needs to be maintained throughout the process.  Rather than passing an argument from function to function to function, and hope it doesnt get to confusing, just create a global variable.p  ul liIn general, its bad practice to declare global variables.li liCan cause problems with Namespace Pollution.li liDuplicate variable declarations of the same name inside and outside of a function.li liGlobal variables are slower to look up than local variables.li liIts easy to forget that you declared the global variable, because its out of site from the current code you are working on.li liTracking and debugging a global variable is hard.li liAsynchronous use of the global variable could cause concurrency issues.li ul  h2Situations where it would be good to declare a global variableh2  ul liA constant that has a lot of characters in it, that is used a lot.

Asynchronous use of anything could cause concurrency issues, so I dont see how that is an argument against global variables.p  pThe Its easy to forget that you declared the global variable, because its out of site from the current code you are working on reason seems like a coding discipline issue.  If I saw that there was no codevar  thisVarcode statement anywhere to be found in that section of code, Id think to myself, Maybe I declared it as a global variable.  Then Id do a search to find it.p  pTracking and debugging a global variable is hard I have a Search All Files option in my code editor.  It searches all the files, and shows me every line of code where the search found a match.  Its not that hard.  Depending on what browser and what developer tools Im using, an error msg may show me the exact line of code where the error came from.p

But the problem is I would like these selections made by the user to be saved, for example, when I click the clock button it lets me choose which app I want to run, then its saved. But I dont know how.p  pAlso I did find a way to do it, I just removed codeIntent.createChoosercode so that I can select use default but when you set it as default, any other button you press  such as the calendar button, it opens the clock button.p  pI have done lots of research on intents and have gotten all this working but Im finding it hard to do that above, please if you know a way of making an App Chooser, where the user gets to select which app to launch when a button is pressed and then that intent gets saved so the user doesnt have to keep choosing.p  pThanks for your time, hopefully Ive asked everything in good manner.p
Negative 28129 pIn a wage processing system which employees MVP pattern We have Model classes codeWageInfocode,  codeEarningInfocode, codeDeductionInfocode and codeAdvanceInfocode and entity class codeAdvancecode. With several other classesp  pcodeEarningInfocode and codeDeductionInfocode has a composition relationship with codeWageInfocode contained in WageInfo and also since Advance amount is a part of wages paid in advance  Ive modeled the relationship of codeAdvancecode with codeDeductionInfocode as aggregation because finally it becomes a deduction to the wages advance amount should be deducted from wages.p  precodepublic class DeductionInfo      public int EmployeeID  get set      public string Name  get set              public decimal LoanInstalmentAmount  get set      public decimal UniformInstalmentAmount  get set      public decimal InsuranceInstalmentAmount  get set            public decimal AdvanceAmount  get  return Advance.Amount  set  Advance.Amount  value        public Advance Advance  new Advance     public class Advance      public int AdvanceID  get set      public decimal Amount  get set      public DateTime EnteredDate  get set   codepre  pSo when I create a codeDeductionInfocode object I simply assign a value to codeAdvanceAmountcode property and Im not initializing other properties of codeAdvancecode class in this instance.p  pMy question is, in DeductionInfo class, since the advance amount is just an amount, is it worth to use codedecimalcode property over an Advance field p

Negative 28129 pSo I am running through OpenCV 2 Computer Vision Application Programming Cookbook by Robert Laganiere. Around page 42 it is talking about a image reduction algorithm. I understand the algorithm  i think but I do not understand exactly why one part was put in. I think I know why but if I am wrong I would like corrected. I am going to copy and paste a little bit of it in here p  blockquote   pColor images are composed of 3channel pixels. Each of these channels   corresponds to the intensity value of one of the three primary colors   red, green, blue. Since each of these values is an 8bit unsigned   char, the total number of colors is 256x256x256, which is more than 16   million colors. Consequently, to reduce the complexity of an analysis,   it is sometimes useful to reduce the number of colors in an image. One   simple way to achieve this goal is to simply subdivide the RGB space   into cubes of equal sizes. For example, if you reduce the number of   colors in each dimension by 8, then you would obtain a total of   32x32x32 colors. Each color in the original image is then assigned a   new color value in the colorreduced image that corresponds to the   value in the center of the cube to which it belongs. Therefore, the   basic color reduction algorithm is simple. If N is the reduction   factor, then for each pixel in the image and for each channel of this   pixel, divide the value by N integer division, therefore the reminder   is lost. Then multiply the result by N, this will give you the   multiple of N just below the input pixel value. Just add N2 and you   obtain the central position of the interval between two adjacent   multiples of N. if you repeat this process for each 8bit channel   value, then you will obtain a total of 256N x 256N x 256N possible   color values. How to do it... The signature of our color reduction   function will be as follows void colorReducecvMat ampimage, int   div64 The user provides an image and the perchannel reduction   factor. Here, the processing is done inplace, that is the pixel   values of the input image are modified by the function. See the   Theres more... section of this recipe for a more general function   signature with input and output arguments. The processing is simply   done by creating a double loop that goes over all pixel values p blockquote  precodevoid colorReducecvMat ampimage, int div64      int nl image.rows  number of lines      total number of elements per line     int nc image.cols  image.channels     for int j0 jltnl j           get the address of row j         uchar data image.ptrltuchargtj         for int i0 iltnc i               process each pixel              data[i]             data[i]divdiv  div2 ltHERE IS WHERE I NEED UNDERSTANDING  end of pixel processing   codepre  pSo I get how I am reducing the 0255 pixel value by div amount. I then lose whatever remainder was left. Then by multiplying it by the div amount again we are scaling it back up to keep it in the range of 0255. strongWhy are we then adding div2 back into the answerstrong The only reason I can think is that this will cause some values to be rounded down and some rounded up. If you dont use it then all your values are rounded down. So in a way it is giving a better averagep  pDont know, so what do you guysgirls thinkp

Negative 28129 pThis should work similar to codememoizecode, but very differently. While memoize should be used with pure functions, it is often useful to speed up IO related functions.p  pThe functionmacro Im looking for should behave like higher order function.

Negative 28129 pI have the problem of rotating my object correctly. What I need is to create a line  along xaxis grabbed to the point so that when you move it, horizontally, vertically or a combination of those two movements, the end of the line circles part of the sphere plane and the beginning of the line stays at rest.p  pI am using the bullet physics engine, which provide objects like quaternions and functions to set their values e.g. using Euler angles or just creating 3 quaternions, filling their fields W,X,Y,Z and finally multiplying them, getting the final quaternion. p  pIve tried to use Euler angles and when I used EulerYXZ setting only Yaw and Roll it works well. But when I add pitch which should be rolling in the direction of the lines axis objects do rotate, but it doesnt circle the sphere any more. Probably my additional rotation incorporated some dislocation and I dont know how to figure it out.p  pFirstly, I created Quaternions which represent yaw and roll like this p  precodebtQuaternion qx,qy,qz,   qx.setW1  qx.setX0  qx.setY0  qx.setZ0   qy.setW btCos xDEGREE2.0f  x is the example angle value,  DEGREE provides radians  qy.setX0  qy.setYbtSin xDEGREE2.0f   qy.setZ0   qz.setWbtCos yinclined DEGREE2.0f   qz.setX0  qz.setY0  qz.setZ btSin yinclinedDEGREE2.0f  codepre  pNow I can get final quaternion by multiplying themp  precodeTransformStick.setRotationqxqyqz codepre  pHow should I add rolling along the lines axis in order not to change the lines end position p

Negative 28129 pIm hesitating on how to organize the memory layout of my 2D data. Basically, what I want is an NM 2D codedoublecode array, where N  M are in the thousands and are derived from usersupplied datap  pThe way I see it, I have 2 choices p  precodedouble data  new double[NM] codepre  por  p  precodedouble data  new double[N] for sizet i  0 i lt N i      data[i]  new double[M] codepre  pThe first choice is what Im leaning to. The main advantages I see are shorter newdelete syntax, continuous memory layout implies adjacent memory access at runtime if I arrange my access correctly, and possibly better performance for vectorized code autovectorized or use of vector libraries such as vDSP or vecLibp  pOn the other hand, it seems to me that allocating a big chunk of continuous memory could failtake more time compared to allocating a bunch of smaller ones. And the second method also has the advantage of the shorter syntax codedata[i][j]code compared to codedata[iMj]codep  pWhat would be the most common  better way to do this, mainly if I try to view it from a performance standpoint even though those are gonna be small improvements, Im curious to see which would more performing.p

Negative 28129 pThis might be tricky because the iframe content heightwidth depends on whether or not the user has the Flash plugin. p  pThe iframe has a maxwidth of 800px, so it scales according to viewport. It loads swfobject.js, which detects the Flash plugin, and swiffit.js, which scales the swf according to the width of the iframe. If there is no Flash plugin, it loads an mp4 video, with a fixed width of 550px.p  pI did a dummy of it herep  pa hrefhttpwww.casedasole.itfancyfit relnofollowhttpwww.casedasole.itfancyfitap  pThe first button opens an iframe that loads the Flash movie if you have flash. The second button loads a copy of the first iframe, but with swfobject.js and swiffit deleted so it behaves as if there is no Flash plugin and therefore loads the mp4.p  pWhat changes to the fancybox settings would make iframe 2 adapt to the size of the videop  pstrongUpdate...strongp  pFound this a hrefhttpdevelopersweblog.comtagfancybox2 relnofollowhttpdevelopersweblog.comtagfancybox2a. Looks simple, cant get it to work.p  pstrongUpdate 2strongp  pThanks JFK, but I cant set fixed widths in advance  the iframe width depends on whether flash is present or not.br Ive inserted codeparent.jQuery.fancybox.updatecode as an codeonclickcode in the links to the iframes, in the script that detects flash in the iframes, and as a script in the div that holds the video. But both the flash iframe and the video iframe go to maxwidth 800px. The only thing that has any effect and is somehow vaguely promising so far is this   p  precode beforeShow function   this.width  .fancybox.contents.finddivmyflash.width   this.height  .fancybox.contents.finddivmyflash.height   codepre  pUpdated example a hrefhttpwww.casedasole.itfancyfit relnofollowhttpwww.casedasole.itfancyfitap  p...in which myflash is the div that contains the flash and, if not detected, contains the div that holds the video. With that, for some reason, the video width goes to minWidth 550px, as wanted, but the height is maxHeight 420px. Thatd be OK, but the flash iframe also takes minWidth and maxHeight. Frustrating,,,,p

Negative 28129 pOne problem that continuously comes up at my workplace is creating clients for Java rest services that we create.  We have 4 different programming languages to support and it is costly to create clients for each programming language.  Often this means our web services arent available in a cross platform manner since we rarely have time to build all of the clients.p  pSOAP provides this type of discovery and machine created client mechanism based off of tools that consume WSDL but our architectural direction is to write REST based services in Java instead of SOAP services.p  pWe would also prefer not to write WSDL documents by hand that expose these REST web services.  In a .NET environment, WCF and ASMX web services automatically create the WSDL for consumption in other applications, but this is not a direction my team is allowed to pursue.  p  pCan this be done in some fashion for a Java based REST servicebr How can this be done without having to invest a lot of manual laborp  pWere currently using spring controllers but might be able to argue for a different Java framework if it provides better velocity.  p

Negative 28129 pI havw two columns of data which I called codeXValscode and codeYValscode from codeA1A65code and codeB1B65code respectively. I want to find 20 of the maximum value in codeYValscode for which I use the codemincode function and then after interpolation find the corresponding codeXvalscode value. p  pThe problem is that because codeYValscode is a traingular function there will be two such 20 corresponding codeXValscode values. I just want to select one and so I thought the best way would be to redefine the range from codeA1A65code to codeAampMatchValampA65code where codeMatchVal  WorksheetFunction.MatchWorksheetFunction.MaxYVals, YVals, 1code. But using plain ampersand characters I am not able to manipulate the range addresses. p  pPlease suggest me a way to change this range from codeA1A65code to say codeA50A65code if codeMatchValcode is 50. After this manipulation I can interpolate and get my value for codeXValscode which lies on the downward slope. p

Negative 28129 pSo in trying to update my currently iOS 7 application that was created with the old Xcode 5 storyboard to be optimized for the iPhone 6, Im running into some issues. I read that its necessary to add the launch images for the iPhone 6 and 6 in order for it to properly size the views.p  pI was able to convert an app created for iOS 7 inside Xcode 6 with the new storyboards and it was simply a matter of adding those launch images. p  pI tried adding the launch images to the former application and upon launch of any device, Xcode crashes. So I went into the storyboard, and converted the whole thing to the new storyboard format. Added the launch images again and its still crashing. p  pAny suggestions p

Negative 28129 pI have a trading card game Like top trumps Where theres a deck of cards on the left and one on the right, I want to pass objects between these lists of cards, which I CAN do. But not without using a switch case to select the new cards as in the code below, I need to pass the card objects and remove them so eventually one list will have all 30 cards and one will have none, how do I do this when all my cards on the left are simply called nextCard Can I use some sort of array Please use some sort os code or pseudocode in your answers, as Im just a beginner.   p  pTLDR Need to move card objects between lists, Adding them to one list, deleting from another. Right now Im using a switch statement to pass in object data to list. Ill answer any questions you ask.p  precodeListltCardsgt myListofCards ListltCardsgt myListofCards2  First card will be displayed on the left on the screen myListofCards  new ListltCardsgt nextCard  new Cards nextCard.cardName  Character nextCard.strength  45 myListofCards.AddnextCard listOfCards.ItemsSource  myListofCards  Second card will be displayed on the right on the screen myListofCards2  new ListltCardsgt nextCard2  new Cards nextCard2.strength2  Character2 nextCard2.age2  42 myListofCards2.AddnextCard listOfCards2.ItemsSource  myListofCards2  When the value of the card on the left of the screen is compared  to the one on the right, it is higher, so the card on the right should move to the deck on the left side. Just to test this out I used the following switch case statement. It works but, when I eventually have about 30 cards and they are being added and removed from the 2 different decks, the case statements obviously will not  work anymore, so what I want is to be able to move the different cards between lists without the switch case.    int index  rand.Nextrandom.Count var i random[index] random.RemoveAtindex  switch i      case 1     myListofCards  new ListltCardsgt     nextCard  new Cards     nextCard.cardName  Character     nextCard.strength  45     myListofCards.AddnextCard     listOfCards.ItemsSource  myListofCards     break      case 2     myListofCards  new ListltCardsgt     nextCard  new Cards     nextCard.cardName  Char     nextCard.strength  55     myListofCards.AddnextCard     listOfCards.ItemsSource  myListofCards     break   int index  rand.Nextrandom.Count var j random[index] random.RemoveAtindex  switch j      case 1     myListofCards2  new ListltCardsgt     nextCard2  new Cards     nextCard2.cardName  Character2     nextCard2.strength  45     myListofCards2.AddnextCard         listOfCards2.ItemsSource  myListofCards     break      case 2     myListofCards2  new ListltCardsgt     nextCard2  new Cards     nextCard2.cardName  Char2     nextCard2.strength  60     myListofCards2.AddnextCard     listOfCards2.ItemsSource  myListofCards     break   public void cardSwapandScore              winback.Visibility  Visibility.Visible         win.Visibility  Visibility.Visible         if nextCard.power gt nextCardComp.powerComp                      win.Text  You win                           myListofCards.AddnextCardComp             myListofCards2.RemovenextCardComp                               else         win.Text  You Lose         win.Visibility  Visibility.Visible                  myListofCards2.AddnextCard         myListofCards.RemovenextCard        codepre

Negative 28129 pI have a controller action in my asp.net mvc 3 application.p  pMy action consist of a db fetching operation and outputs the result into a view. I can use the OutputCache action filter attribute to store the action result into cache. I can also use the MemoryCache class to store the data of db fetching operation. Both of them will show data from cache. OutputCache will store the whole result into the cache. MemoryCache class will store the db fetch result into cache and the action will fetch data from cache rather than making a new db request for the same result.p  pMy question is which one would be better to apply I have a felling that OutputCache action filter attribute will work nice as it will store both the db fetch result and action result into cache.p

Negative 28129 pas explained in previous posts I have a Postgresql relational database with about 10M rows.

I already tried different solutions first of all I used the batch importer with a CSV file of my database, then I created a flexible script with Groovy again using a CSV file. These methods work but they imply the creation of a CSV file which isnt ideal in my case. Is there a possibiliy to connect to my DB directly with Neo4j  Thanksp

I changed all of the references to ApplicationUser to User, but I still got the same error. I changed back to ApplicationUser, tried scaffolding it again, in Controllers instead of in AreasAdmin. That seemed to work, until I ran the application. It gives me the exact same error.p  precodeusing System.Data.Entity using System.Security.Claims using System.Threading.Tasks using Microsoft.AspNet.Identity using Microsoft.AspNet.Identity.EntityFramework  namespace ImpHer.Models       You can add profile data for the user by adding more properties to your ApplicationUser class, please visit httpgo.microsoft.comfwlinkLinkID317594 to learn more.     public class ApplicationUser  IdentityUser              public string PostalCode  get set          public async TaskltClaimsIdentitygt GenerateUserIdentityAsyncUserManagerltApplicationUsergt manager                       Note the authenticationType must match the one defined in CookieAuthenticationOptions.AuthenticationType             var userIdentity  await manager.CreateIdentityAsyncthis, DefaultAuthenticationTypes.ApplicationCookie              Add custom user claims here             return userIdentity                    public class ApplicationDbContext  IdentityDbContextltApplicationUsergt              public ApplicationDbContext              baseDefaultConnection, throwIfV1Schema false                            public static ApplicationDbContext Create                      return new ApplicationDbContext                   public System.Data.Entity.DbSetltImpHer.Models.Projectgt Projects  get set           public System.Data.Entity.DbSetltImpHer.Models.Categorygt Categories  get set           public System.Data.Entity.DbSetltImpHer.Models.ApplicationUsergt ApplicationUsers  get set        codepre  pThis is codeIdentityModels.cscode, who can help mep

Negative 28129 pIm working on a project for an education institution and we currently have liveedu set up with the SSO Toolkit 4.5.  We have a portal home grown that our users log in to using their AD credentials local AD only and then we wire up the certificate to pass up to liveedu so theyre not prompted again for login creds when they view their MS mail.p  pMS is going to stop support for this methodology at the end of the year and so were now in the process of upgrading our environment to work with Office 365 education.  As such, we have set up and ADFS with an Azure AD but Im struggling getting a process in place where our users still only need to enter their login credentials once on our portal which is externally facing and then providing them with a token that will persist on their trip to Office 365.  Right now it works as follows users go to portal.microsoftonline.com and enter their email address.  When they tab out of that field, MS checks and finds our domain so then redirects the user back to a login page for our ADFS solution.  At this point, users are required to log in again if theyre not already logged in or theyre taken to the MS offerings.p  pBottom line, instead of making a single sign on solution, theyve added more places that our users need to provide their credentials or just username email address.p  pIm wondering if theres a solution we can provide to our users similar to the SSO Toolkit 4.5 way of doing things where we can authenticate our users only once on our portal, then provide them access to the O365 servicesp  pIm not an infrastructure guy at all so I may have provided some misinformation above as to how we have things set up.  What I do know from our current implementation is that we need to use WSFederation.p  pIm wondering if a SAML approach would solve the issue Ive described above and let us just challenge for credentials once on our portal page.p  pany ideas or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.p  pTIAp

Negative 28129 pI will be very thankful for looking at my code and telling me whether if I create a structure for which I am dynamically allocating memory, should I dynamically allocate memory also for the structures elements that are int or double p  pAs it can be seen in the example below, I use malloc only for those elements of the structure which size can change, namely strings. I tried to use malloc for int or double variables elements of the structure, but everything worked fine until I tried to use the function printf on them. p  pIt refused to work because printfd, [structure][int element] was not correct.p  pSo I changed the code and int and double structure members are processed with the malloc and realloc functions.

Negative 28129 pIm working on a toy kernel for fun and education not a class project. Im starting work on my memory manager, so Im trying to get the memory map from BIOS using an codeINT 0x15, EAXE820code call while still in Real Mode. Im adapting my function from the osdev wiki a hrefhttpwiki.osdev.orgDetectingMemoryx86 relnofollowherea, in the section Getting an E820 Memory Map. However, I want this to be a function I can call from my C code, so Im trying to change it a bit. I want it to take two arguments a pointer to where to store the map entries, and a pointer to an integer which will be incremented by the number of entries in the table.p  pAccording to the wiki, codeESDIcode needs to be pointing at where the data should be stored, so I split my first argument into two the segment selector, codepointertomap  16code, and the offset, codepointertomap  16code.

By moving coderetcode commands around, I found that the function crashes on the very first line. If I comment out the call in C, then everything works as youd expect.p  pIve read through Google that theres almost never a reason to set codeESDIcode directly, and in the code that Ive found which does, they set it to a literal.

Negative 28129 pIve been trying to find some good online resources for learning how to write a mappingorm.xml for JPA 2.p  pIm finding it just impossible.  All examples are either for an earlier version, or they simply arent there.

I have implemented code very similar to this examplep  pa hrefhttpdemos.jquerymobile.com1.4.0listviewautocompleteremote relnofollowhttpdemos.jquerymobile.com1.4.0listviewautocompleteremoteap  pThe problem is, I do not want jQuery Mobile to filter the results after I have already filtered them on the server because it will hide valid results from the user.p  pFor example my requirement is that  percent sign is a wild card in the search text.

Negative 28129 pI want to read a barcode from a scanned image that I printed. The image format is not relevant. I found that the scanned images are of very low quality and can understand why it normal barcodes fail. p  pMy idea is to create a non standard and very simple barcode at the top of each page printed. It will be code20 squarescode in a row forming a simple binary code.codeFilled  1, open  0code. It will be large enough on acodeA4code to make detection easy. p  pAt this stage I need to load the image and find the barcode somewhere at the top. It will not be exactly at the same spot as it is scanned in. Step into each block and build the ID. p  pAny knowledge or links to info would be awesome. p

Negative 28129 pI am using a div to create an accent. Its parent is the content div, which has no specific height, as it is the height of the browser.

Though, if the percentages are replaced with pixel values, the div displays correctly.

In particular, I can find the zeros, min, max, etc of the function over any interval I specify. p  pI am translating this code into python, mostly as an exercise in learning python, and I was wondering if there is anything similar perhaps in numpy that I could use, instead of setting up a numpy array with an arbitrary set of h values to process over. p  pI could do something like pseudocodep  precodef  numpy.arraythat function for h in numpy.arangehmin, hmax,hstep codepre  pbut this commits me to a step size. Is there any way to avoid that and get the full precision like in matlabp  pEDIT what I actually want at the end of the day is to find the zeroes, max, and min locations not values of the function f. It looks like scipy might have some functions that are more useful here a hrefhttpdocs.scipy.orgdocscipyreferenceoptimize.html relnofollowhttpdocs.scipy.orgdocscipyreferenceoptimize.htmlap

Negative 28129 pI am trying to move files using Applescript, and I get an error every time I run the app.  In the contents of the app, I have the files I want to move so if I distribute the app the users wont have to separately download the files.  That is also why I am using codepath to home folder as textcode and adding the specific file path past that.

Negative 28129 pSo I understand, for the most part, how SEQ and ACK numbers are determined SEQ  SND.NXT  ISN  bytes sent, ACK  RCV.NXT  SEQ expected from the next received packet.  What Im wondering is how the SEQ increment along with SND.NXT and SND.UNA when sending a pure ACK packet. p  pex  Im giving the Client A an ISN  1, and the Server B ISN  100p  precodeA gt SEQ  1, ACK  100, LEN  412 bytes A RCV.NXT  100, SND.NXT  413, SND.UNA  1 B RCV.NXT  413, SND.NXT  100, SND.UNA  100  A lt SEQ  100, ACK  413, LEN  0 A RCV.NXT  101, SND.NXT  413, SND.UNA  413 B RCV.NXT  413, SND.NXT  101, SND.UNA  101 or 101  A lt SEQ  101, ACK  413, LEN  1448 A RCV.NXT  101, SND.NXT  413, SND.UNA  413 B RCV.NXT  413, SND.NXT  1549, SND.UNA  101  A gt SEQ  413, ACK  1549, LEN  0 A RCV.NXT  1549, SND.NXT  414, SND.UNA  414 or 413 B RCV.NXT  414, SND.NXT  1549, SND.UNA  1549 codepre  pIt seems to make sense to increment SND.NXT every time you send a packet even if payload len  0, but would you also increment the SND.UNA  This seems rather arbitrary and a strange exception to the SND.UNA  ACK assignment.  However, it seems to me, that if you dont do this then your SND.UNA will be off by one at the end of an exchange.  p  pIs there something Im missingp
Negative 28129 pWhen I first read about interpreters I was under the impression they took the source language and, one statement at a time, translated it into machine language and fed it to the CPU to be executed.p  pHowever, I just learned interpreters execute the code directly and the JVM has its own set of machine instructions which the bytecode is translated to and it is executed from there. The second makes a little more sense to me as I know the JVM has its own virtual processor and what little I know indicates you cannot execute code without a processor.p  pIf this is accurate does this mean all interpreters are VMs If the host processor is not involved then how does all this workp  pIve done a little research here and elsewhere but the answers I can understand arent clear and the rest assumes I have knowledge of concepts I have not been introduced to yet.p  pI would appreciate a fairly simple answer. p

Negative 28129 pWorking on project Euler problem 26, and wanting to use an algorithm looking for the prime, p with the largest order of 10 modulo p.  Essentially the problem is to look for the denominator which creates the longest repetend in a decimal.  After a bunch of wikipedia reading, it looks like the prime described above would fulfill that.  But, unfortunately, it looks like taking the very large powers of 10 results in an error.  My question then is  is there a way of getting around this error making the numbers smaller, or should I abandon this strategy and just do long division with the plan being to focus on the primes. [of note, in the orderten method I can get it to run if I limit the powers of 10 to 300 and probably can go a bit long, which goes along with the length of a long]p  pdiv classsnippet datalangjs datahidefalse div classsnippetcode pre classsnippetcodehtml langhtml prettyprintoverridecodeimport math  def primeseivelimit seivelist  [True]limit seivelist[0]  seivelist[1]  False for i in range2, limit if seivelist[i]  True    n  2 while in lt limit  seivelist[in]  False get rid of multiples n  n1 primenumbers  [i for i,j in enumerateseivelist if j  True] return primenumbers  def ordertenn  for k in range1, n  if math.pow10,k 1n  0 return k  primes  primeseive1000 maxorder  0 maxorderd  1 for x in reversedprimes  order  ordertenx if order gt maxorder  maxorder  order maxorderd  x  print maxorder print maxorderdcodepre div div p

Negative 28129 pI am trying to run compile tests on a series of build machines so Ive written a script to distribute the jobs to each machine. I am using PsExec from microsoft which installs a service on the build machines where it runs commands from. On each build machine I have a batch file which calls a python script that runs all of the tests on want. The original script will pass what test to run, as well as logging information so I can store the results and keep track of it later. p  pThe original script can call all of the machines and execute the batch file properly. If I run the batch file locally on each machine it calls the python script correctly which compiles everything fine. But when I run the batch file remotely from the original script I get the following compile errorp  precodefatal error C1902 Program database manager mismatch please check your installation codepre  pover and over again. I am using Microsoft Visual Studio 12 on each machine and python 2.7. Does anyone know why that error would happen only because the script calling the bat file that calls the python script Any help or push in the right direction would be GREATLY appreciated Thanks p

A more concrete example and in my case, is one of the objects I have would be with an address and the sub types associated with them. Several different types of elements have an address. For example, I have a Product element that has a Seller, Supplier, Reseller, a list of stakeholder each with an address, etc. Each one of these addresses has a different name.p  pdiv classsnippet datalangjs datahidefalse div classsnippetcode pre classsnippetcodehtml langhtml prettyprintoverridecodeltProductgt   ltSellergt     ltBusinessAddressgt...ltBusinessAddressgt     ltDistributionAddressgt...ltDistributionAddressgt     ltMainContactAddressgt...ltMainContactAddressgt   ltSellergt   ltReSellergt     ltBusinessAddressgt...ltBusinessAddressgt     ltStoreManagerAddressgt...ltStoreManagerAddressgt     ltMainContactAddressgt...ltMainContactAddressgt   ltReSellergt   ltSuppliergt     ltBusinessAddressgt...ltBusinessAddressgt     ltDistributionCenterAddressgt...ltDistributionCenterAddressgt     ltMainContactAddressgt...ltMainContactAddressgt   ltSuppliergt   ltStakeholdersgt     ltEntitygt       ltHomeAddressgt...ltHomeAddressgt       ltWorkAddressgt...ltWorkAddressgt       ltSecondaryAddressgt...ltSecondaryAddressgt       ltStreetgt...ltStreetgt       ltCrossStreetgt...ltCrossStreetgt     ltEntitygt   ltStakeholdersgt ltProductgt ltSurveyRespondentsgt   ltSurveyRespondentgt     ltAddressgt...ltAddressgt     ltBusinessgt...ltBusinessgt   ltSurveyRespondentgt   ltSurveyRespondentgt     ltAddressgt...ltAddressgt     ltBusinessgt...ltBusinessgt   ltSurveyRespondentgt ltSurveyRespondentsgtcodepre div div p  pNow this isnt all of the elements that have addresses, but if I go with the approaches I have done before I would have to either make a list of templates like I mentioned above or go with a long list of matches like michael.hor257k suggested. p  pdiv classsnippet datalangjs datahidefalse div classsnippetcode pre classsnippetcodehtml langhtml prettyprintoverridecodeltxsltemplate matchAddress  Business  SecondaryAddress  WorkAddress  Home  SecondaryAddress  BusinessAddress  ...gt   lt apply the same transform to all of these gt ltxsltemplategtcodepre div div p  pTo compound my problem each address is made up of multiple subtypes AddressCategory, District, Zone, Street, StreetType, PostDirection, PreDirection, etc. Each one of these types has the same structure, but now I run into the problem of how to I match against every type.

Negative 28129 pHello I built my application using angularjs and laravel. Personally, I use firefox for development and testing, so I did not notice this till it was brought to my attention. My application works only in firefox but not chrome or chrome based browsers, I am also unable to trace the source of the problem.  I have a button directive that when clicked on executes a function to post data to the server, now this works fine in firefox but not in chrome, you would think that an issue like cross browser compatibility not working would have something to do with client side code but my application throws a 500 internal server error strongONLYstrong in chrome or chrome based browsers.p  pI tested the function by posting an alert inside and the function was indeed getting called. I then went to the server side and found the controller that processed the request, removed the code within the assigned function and simply just did a p  precodereturn hello codepre  pThat still did not work, kept getting the same error. Next, instead of using my button directive I just used a normal html button and once again, I got the same error. I have no idea what is going on or how to solve it.

Negative 28129 pIn my .NET applications GUI done in C, but I dont think that matters are codeTextBoxcodees and codeRadioButtoncodes handling user changeable data. p  pFor the TextBoxes, I handle the codeKeyDowncode and the codeTextChangedcode event. During the initial setting of the TextBoxes codeTextcode, of course the codeTextChangedcode event fires, but since there was no codeKeyDowncode event first, the data is not changed by the user so it does not have to be written back to the store.p  pNow I wanted to use the same technique for the RadioButtons using the codeClickcode or codeMouseClickcode event as a user interaction detector. Unfortunately both codeClickcode events fire embeforeem the codeCheckedChangedcode event.p  pThis  IMHO  is just wrong. The codeCheckedcode property cannot change embeforeem the control is clicked. Is this a logical error or does this happen for a reason Is there any way to force correct behaviourp  pTo solve the GUI problem, of course I could monitor the more fitting equivalent codeMouseDowncode or just introduce a variable for initial setting of the Controls values. But this is about understanding the logic here.p

In other situations no formatter specified or writing to the console the logging works as expected.  p  pHeres simplified codep  precodevar winston  requirewinston  function formatterargs      return some formatting   args.message   var weirdLogger  new winston.Logger     transports [         new winston.transports.Console             json false,             formatter formatter         ,         new winston.transports.File             filename weirdLogger.csv,             json false,             formatter formatter              ]   var workingLogger  new winston.Logger     transports [         new winston.transports.Console             json false         ,         new winston.transports.File             filename workingLogger.csv,             json false              ]   var weirdLogTest  function       weirdLogger.infotest1     workingLogger.infotest2   var expectedBehaviorLogTest  function       weirdLogger.infotest1   new Date.getTime     workingLogger.infotest2   new Date.getTime   setIntervalweirdLogTest, 5000 setIntervalexpectedBehaviorLogTest, 5000 codepre  pAs written, this code shows test1 and test2 being logged to the console every five seconds and codeworkingLogger.csvcode being updated, but codeweirdLogger.csvcode is not.  Commenting out codesetIntervalweirdLogTest, 5000code and commenting in the expectedBehavior test shows that logging happens as expected when the date is appended to each log. p  pIve been unable to find anything in the docs about ignoring duplicate messages or other things that would explain this.  Any ideas about what Im doing incorrectly  It could be a bug, but I dont want to rule out user error. p
Negative 28129 pThis one,is one of the strangest i have seen for a while .p  pUsing iPhone6 on simulator, our app has a emmain classemview controller that has a codeUIScrollviewcode.p  pThat scrollview loads to its 3 pages,a 3 different codeview controllerscodeclasses.p  pEach view controller has its own codecollection viewcode.p  pWe load them to the main scroller like that p  precode self.someviewcontroller[[someviewcontroller alloc] initWithPosition0]   self.someviewcontroller2[[someviewcontroller2 alloc] initWithPosition1] [scroller addSubviewself.someviewcontroller] [scroller addSubviewself.someviewcontroller1] codepre  pNow these codesomeviewcontrollercode has a codeUICollectionviewcode inside it. In simulator we see the collection view and it works great. On the actual iPhone6, you just dont see the collection view  his delegates are still being called all cells delegates are calledp  pthe codesomeviewcontrollercode looks like that p  precode     idinitWithPositionNSIntegerposition                if self  [super init]                      myPosition  position                   return self        voidviewDidLoad      [super viewDidLoad]  some stuff here collection view     UICollectionViewFlowLayout layout[[UICollectionViewFlowLayout alloc] init]     self.collectionView[[UICollectionView alloc] initWithFrameself.view.frame collectionViewLayoutlayout]     [self.collectionView setDataSourceself]     [self.collectionView setDelegateself]     [self.collectionView registerClass[UICollectionViewCell class] forCellWithReuseIdentifiercellIdentifier]     [self.collectionView setBackgroundColor[UIColor clearColor]]     [self.view addSubviewself.collectionView] codepre  pWhy i dont see the collection view in the actually device does it has to do with the fact that it is inside a view controller that is inside a scroller p  pbtw on the simulator, i see the collection view emonlyem if its in a view controller that is in page number0 in the scroller. if its in viewcontoller in page 1 , i also not see it on the simulator.p

Negative 28129 pI have an a hrefhttpwww.geforce.co.ukhardwaredesktopgpusgeforcegtx750tispecifications relnofollownvidia GTX 750 Ti carda, which is advertised as having 640 CUDA cores. Indeed, the nvidia settings application also reports this.p  pIm trying to use this card to do OpenCL development on Linux. Now, I have reported from the OpenCL environment through PyOpenCL if it makes a difference that the number of compute units is 5. My understanding is that one compute unit on an nvidia device maps to one multiprocessor, which I understand to be 32 SIMD units which I assume is the a CUDA core.p  pClearly, 5  32 is not 640 rather a quarter of what is expected.p  pAm I missing something as regards the meaning of a a work unit on nvidia The card is also driving the graphics output which will be using some of the computational capability  is a proportion of the processing capability reserved for graphics use if so, can I change this.p

Negative 28129 pI have a UITableView  NSFetchedResultsController combination for loading comments. The comments include name, date, body, and importantly an avatar image. The comments are stored in Core Data.p  pUpon viewDidLoad, it checks to see if the comments have been loaded from my source. If they have not been downloaded it spawns an NSOperation to download and scrape the HTML to get the name, date, body, and URL for the avatars for each comment. It also makes the Core Data entities for all of these. Being a background threaded NSOperation, it uses a private NSManagedObjectContext to do the work and saves it back into the main MOC.p  pOnce those are added to the store, my NSFetchedResultsController calls the delegate methods controllerWillChangeContent, didChangeSection, didChangeObject, and controllerDidChangeContent. It works fine when inserting the batch of new comments, and inserts them into the table view just fine.p  pMy table view cells are using iOS8s UITableViewAutomaticDimension to have dynamic heights, depending on the length of content for each comment. If I only show the text of each comment ignoring avatar images for now everything works as expected and scrolling through comments works fine, and it all looks ordinary.p  pHowever my problem comes in when its loading avatar images. In my configureCell which is called by cellForRowAtIndexPath and controllerdidChangeObject it checks to see if the image has been downloaded yet or not. If not, it spawns a new, different kind of NSOperation to go fetch the image based on the comments avatarImageURL property. When it has been fetched, it adds the data of the image into the Core Data entity. It also signals the table view controller via a custom delegation method that the image has been updated. My fetched results controller also signals my table view controller view via controllerdidChangeObject.p  pThis is where the problems come in.p  hr  pWhen scrolling very fast, and for the first time this data is being downloaded and stored into Core Data the table view and the dynamically resizing cells act very weird. they change size many times when scrolling both up and down. And only after having scrolled through the entirety of the cells once or twice, everything is smooth after that.p  pWhen i completely disable the spawning of NSOperations to download the avatars, everything again works and scrolls fine. However, if I let it download the images and add them to the Core Data entity, but fail to implement the custom delegation method and the NSFetchedResultsChangeUpdate case for controllerdidChangeObject, it still results in the weird, choppy scrolling initially.p  pOne thing I did notice, via NSLogs, is that all comments are inserted into the table view in a single batch, whereas every time a single avatar is downloaded, the fetched results controller will issue willChangeContent, didChangeObject, and didChangeContent. Again, those three methods all for a single avatar.p  pRelevant methods I can add more if necessaryp  precode voidviewDidLoad      [super viewDidLoad]       First get our current array of comic infos, initiating the controller     NSError fetchError     if [[self fetchedResultsController] performFetchampfetchError]          NSLogError in the fetched results controller , fetchError.description         return  Dont do anything else.           self.tableView.estimatedRowHeight  70.0f     self.tableView.rowHeight  UITableViewAutomaticDimension      if self.comicInfo.comments  nil  self.comicInfo.comments.count  0          CommentsRetrieverOperation operation  [[CommentsRetrieverOperation alloc] initWithComicInfoIDself.comicInfo.objectID]         operation.managedObjectContext  self.managedObjectContext         [self.commentDownloadQueue addOperationoperation]         UITableViewCell tableViewUITableView tableView cellForRowAtIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath      UITableViewCell cell  [tableView dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifierCommentCell forIndexPathindexPath]       Configure the cell...

Is there a better way to implement this all, and am I implementing this wrong Is there a better way than just loading all images at the very beginningp  pEdit Some clarification. As I scroll down in the table view, the fetched results controller sends updates to the objects. So when I scroll down willChangeContent, didChangeObject for typeNSFetchedResultsChangeUpdate, and didChangeContent are called for each new cell entering the view.p

Negative 28129 pRecently Ive followed a CQRS workshop which made me wonder how events are stored when using event sourcing.p  pI think that after every single event the entire application should be in a valid state otherwise the replay functionality is useless. This means that event should be stored in exactly the order they happened. I also believe that the order of events for all aggregates is important. For example, a user could make a product and an order product and order both being separate aggregates, order references product through an ID. This means that the create product event should be stored before the add product to event. Otherwise replaying would could lead to an invalid state where the order, referencing the product, exists before the product exists.p  pHow is this situation handled Should you always send events to the database using a synchronous methods, for example by locking the database Is this solution scalable Or should you store events for each aggregate in a different table But how do you ensure ordering then Another option would be to store the time for each event, and sort by that. Is the precision of timers on a PC high enough to be able to do thatp

Negative 28129 pI know that my question is general, but Im new to AI area. I have an experiment with some parameters almost 6 parameters. Each one of them is independent one, and I want to find the optimal solution for maximum or minimum the output function. However, if I want to do it in traditional programming technique it will take much time since i will use six nested loops.p  pI just want to know which AI technique to use for this problem Genetic Algorithm Neural Network Machine learningp  h2Updateh2  pActually, the problem could have more than one evaluation function. It will have one function that we should minimize it Cost and another function the we want to maximize it Capacity Maybe another functions can be added. Example Construction a glass window can be done in a million ways. However, we want the strongest window with lowest cost. There are many parameters that affect the pressure capacity of the window such as the strength of the glass, Height and Width, slope of the window.  Obviously, if we go to extreme cases Largest strength glass, with smallest width and height, and zero slope the window will be extremely strong. However, the cost for that will be very high.p  pI want to study the interaction between the parameters in specific range. p

Negative 28129 pThe problem starts when I tried to install empuppetem and emlibrarianpuppetem on CentOS 6.6. Puppet is easy using yum.

I can try to downgrade the version of some module dependencies of gem install and succeed.p  pHowever, I was wondering if I want to use RVM, how can I tell so that puppet and librarianpuppet or any gem install strongemuniformlyemstrong uses the ruby version I want e.g. 2.2.2p  pSo far, lots of people against rvm root installation which is understood. And rvm itself is mostly driven for per user based installation.p  pIf I install puppet first and let the package creates puppet user and install rvm on puppet user home dir, I am still faced with permission and user issue. The etcpuppet directory belongs to root by default and doing sudo gem install librarianpuppet will make root to install the gem which is not aware of the ruby rvm installation belongs to puppet user.p  pSo bottom line install rvm and ruby as puppet user would conflict with the permission on etcpuppet and execution when escalated as root via sudo. How can I make rvm and its installed rubygems visible on system wide levelp  pAny hints would be appreciated.p

Negative 28129 pI have an application that Im developing in symfony 2 with doctrine. The problem Im facing is the slowly changing dimension. p  pFor example I have three Entities Dossier, Payout and PayoutCategory. Dossier has a many to one relationship with Payout and Payout a many to one relationship with PayoutCategory.p  pThe important part is the relation between a Payout and a PayoutCategory. The PayoutCategory contains 2 important fields emceilingem and emprocentualem. The ceiling describes the maximum allowed payout of a dossier. Since a dossier can have serveral payouts of the strongsamestrong PayoutCategory all these payouts are counted together and multiplied by the procentual field. The total of the calculation is either smaller or equal to the ceiling if not ceiling value is returned. Now if either the ceiling or procentual or the name field gets updated the previous made dossiers are also changed. So my question is there a bundle out there that handles this problem Because I have several relationships similar to this one.p  pI have tried the builtin doctrine a hrefhttpsgithub.comAtlantic18DoctrineExtensionsblobmasterdocloggable.md relnofollowloggable behavioura and the a hrefhttpsgithub.comsimplethingsEntityAudit relnofollowEntityAuditBundlea but they dont solve this. Although they add a version field to PayoutCategory the version field is just to track changes of the entity itself. In fact I need the version field as part of the relationship foreign key in Payout between Payout and PayoutCategory.p

I also want to have the dataframe column of each such string instance. p  pSo, if my dataframe were the following p  precode      A    B    C    D a    x  a  r   a b    y  y  b   b c    z  x  x   y codepre  pI want the following information not neccesarily in list or tuple format.  p  precode    [x,A, y, A, z, A, a, B, r,C, b,C, a,D, y,D] codepre  pI dont really care about the format for the output.  The only requirement is that the output be in a format in which I can quickly reference each retrieved string and its column. Speed here is my priority, as I am dealing with many columns, each one being 20 rows long.p  pAny ideas regarding the fastest way to accomplish this Thanks  Aaronp

Negative 28129 pIm reading the a hrefhttpdocwiki.embarcadero.comRADStudioXE8enUsingMenusinaFireMonkeyApplication relnofollowdocumentation for menus in Firemonkey desktop applicationsa. It explains that there are two completely different menu components, one is to be used for Windows codeTMenuBarcode and the other is to be used for OSX codeTMainMenucode.p  pFurther, it also explains that a codeTMenuBarcode does not display on OSX nonstandard for OSX, and that a codeTMainMenucode is placed in the nonclient area of the Windows form nonstandard for Windowsp  pIts my understanding that Firemonkey is supposed to be one codebase for multiple platforms, but it appears they want me to separate the two. I can understand the menus work differently across both platforms, but it seems like an unnecessary pain to implement two different main menus and conditionally showhide them depending on the platform. I have no intention of using the special capabilities of menus specific to either platform. Not to mention the codeTMenuBarcode is completely ugly.p  pSince the codeTMainMenucode also shows on Windows, but yet also claims its nonstandard for Windows, can I assume that the codeTMainMenucode is sufficient for both Or do I really need to implement a separate codeTMenuBarcode just for Windows What are the implications if I dont separate themp  pI saw a hrefhttpswww.youtube.comwatchvwlydK5kvhBw relnofollowthis videoa, but Its for Delphi XE2, and I cant find such an option in the Delphi XE8 codeTMenuBarcode control.
