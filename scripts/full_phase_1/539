I have to get the values from the detector subsets into the result dataframe. Here it is important that each values finds the way to the right position in the dataframe. The issue is that there are not equally many values since some samples lack some detectors. p  pI tried to do the following Iterate through the detector subsets, compare the rowname samplename with each other and if its the same write the value into the new dataframe. In case it it is not the same, it should write an NA.   p  precodefor i in 1lengthdetectors   for j in 1lengthgetdetectors[i]Sample     result[j,i]  ifelsegetdetectors[i]Sample[j]  rownamesresult[j,], getdetectors[i]Ct.Mean[j], NA      codepre  pThe trouble is, that this stops the iteration through the detectorSample column and it switches to the next detector. My understanding is that the comparing samples get out of sync, yielding the all following ifelse yield a NA. p  pI tried to circumvent it somehow by editing the ifelsetest, yes, no NO with jj1 to get it back in sync, but this unfortunately didnt work.p  pI hope I could make my problem understandable to youp  pLooking forward to hear any suggestions, or comments also how to general improve my code p  pThanks Mat p

Negative 539 pI have a .NET 2.0 server that seems to be running into scaling problems, probably due to poor design of the sockethandling code, and I am looking for guidance on how I might redesign it to improve performance.p  pstrongUsage scenariostrong 50  150 clients, high rate up to 100s  second of small messages 10s of bytes each to  from each client. Client connections are longlived  typically hours. The server is part of a trading system. The client messages are aggregated into groups to send to an exchange over a smaller number of outbound socket connections, and acknowledgment messages are sent back to the clients as each group is processed by the exchange. OS is Windows Server 2003, hardware is 2 x 4core X5355. p  pstrongCurrent client socket designstrong A codeTcpListenercode spawns a thread to read each client socket as clients connect. The threads block on codeSocket.Receivecode, parsing incoming messages and inserting them into a set of queues for processing by the core server logic. Acknowledgment messages are sent back out over the client sockets using async codeSocket.BeginSendcode calls from the threads that talk to the exchange side.p  pstrongObserved problemsstrong As the client count has grown now 6070, we have started to see intermittent delays of up to 100s of milliseconds while sending and receiving data tofrom the clients. We log timestamps for each acknowledgment message, and we can see occasional long gaps in the timestamp sequence for bunches of acks from the same group that normally go out in a few ms total. p  pOverall system CPU usage is low lt 10, there is plenty of free RAM, and the core logic and the outbound exchangefacing side are performing fine, so the problem seems to be isolated to the clientfacing socket code. There is ample network bandwidth between the server and clients gigabit LAN, and we have ruled out network or hardwarelayer problems.p  pAny suggestions or pointers to useful resources would be greatly appreciated. If anyone has any diagnostic or debugging tips for figuring out exactly what is going wrong, those would be great as well.p  pemNote I have the MSDN Magazine article a hrefhttpmsdn2.microsoft.comenusmagazinecc300760.aspxWinsock Get Closer to the Wire with HighPerformance Sockets in .NETa, and I have glanced at the Kodart XF.Server component  it looks sketchy at best.emp

Negative 539 pHow can I efficiently catch and handle segmentation faults from C in an OSX Carbon applicationp  pBackground I am making an OSX Carbon application. I must call a library function from a third party. Because of threading issues, the function can occasionally crash, usually because its updating itself from one thread, and its got some internally stale pointer or handle as I query it from another. The function is a black box to me. I want to be able to call the function but be able to catch if it has crashed and supply an alternative return.  In Windows, I can use the simple Visual C and Intel C compilers try and except.p  precode Working Windows Example  try  xDangerousFunctiony exceptEXCEPTIONEXECUTEHANDLER x0.0  whups, func crashed  codepre  pI am trying to make the same kind of crashcatcher for OSX. I am using pure C on a very large application. I call the function millions of times per second, so efficiency is very important too. Impressively, the Windows try overhead is immeasurably smallp  pHeres what I have experimented withp  p1 C exceptions. I am not sure if C exceptions catch the segfault crashes. And my app is currently C. I could try wrappers and ifdefs to make it C but this is a lot of work for the app, and I dont think C exceptions will catch the crash.p  p2 signal  setjump  longjmp. I thought this would work... its what its designed for. But I set up my SEGV error handler [in fact I set it up for every signal] and its never called during the crash. I can manually test and succeed when calling raiseSEGV. But the crashes dont seem to actually call it.  My thoughts are that CFM applications do NOT have access to the full BSD signals, only a subset, and that Mach applications are necessary for the Real Thing. p  p3 MPSetExceptionHandler.  Not well documented. I attempted to set a handler. It compiled and ran, but did not catch the segfault.p

Negative 539 pAt Disney World, they use a system called a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiFASTPASSFastpassa to create a second, shorter line for popular rides.  The idea is that you can wait in the standard line, often with a wait longer than an hour, or you can get a FastPass which allows you to come back during a specified time block usually a couple hours later and only wait for 10 minutes or less.  You can only be waiting for one ride at a time with a FastPass.p  pI have been trying to figure out the queue theory behind this concept, but the only explanation I have found is that it is designed to get people out of the lines and doing things that will bring in additional revenue shopping, eating, etc.  p  pIs this why FastPass was implemented, or is there a real visitor efficiency problem that it solving  Are there software applications that have applied similar logic  Are there software applications that emshouldem apply similar logicp  pPart of the problem I see with implementing something similar in software is that it is based on users choosing their queue.

It looks like Ill be on my own for this.p  pWhat I think that Ive decided to do, and its going to need a geek week to accomplish, is to write some sort of a tool much like how a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiWiX relnofollowWiXa and a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiNAnt relnofollowNAnta works, so that I can just write an overzealous XML document to handle the work.p  pIf I think that it is worthwhile, Ill publish it on CodePlex andor a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiTheCodeProject relnofollowThe Code Projecta because Ive used both sites a bit to gain better understanding of concepts for jobs Ive done in the past, and I think it is probably worthwhile to give back a little.p  hr  pEdit on 532010p  pIf someone is willing to name the project, Ill upload the dirtynasty version that Ive written for MS SQL to CodePlex so that maybe we can start hacking out a version of SQL Compact.  Although, I think with the next revision of the initial application that I was planning, Im going to be abandoning SQL Compact and just use XML Files for storage, as the software is being converted from an Installable package to being a Silverlight application.  Silverlight just gives a better access strategy.p
Negative 539 pTesting a texttospeech engine is a rather daunting task. The engine itself parses input and applies rules for pronunciation based on phonetic analysis of individual words.  In addition exception lists for the pronounciation rules exist to improve the end result.  Projects such as a hrefhttpwww.gutenberg.orgbrowsescorestop relnofollowThe Guttenberg Projecta allow you to literally throw emthe bookem at the problem however, the problem remains that I can never feel comfortable due to the domain of the problem.  I am after a six nines solution 99.9999 crash proof.  Throwing random text at the engine shows clearly that I am only at three nines and subsequent fixes dont appear to be helping.  I know what to do in this case revisit the error handling mechanisms within the engine to make them degrade gracefully.  The general issue persists.  In any infinite input domain how do you prove software qualityp

Negative 539 pIve got a bit of a problem. My application communicates with BizTalk to extract data from a database, passing in a key value from the UI which is used for the look up. I have a couple of regEx checks in the UI to make sure that the user enters a correctly formatted key value. If they dont, any input errors is caught in the UIvalidation and no postback occurs. The errors are displayed next to the input field in question as well as in a validation summary located in the master page. p  pMy problem is that if the user enters a correctly formated key value and submits, and BizTalk returns an error, this error is presented in a label on the content page, just below the submit button. If the user then proceeds to enter a new key value, but doesnt type it in in a correct format, the UIvalidation kicks in and no postback occurs, and the previous server error is displayed even though it is no longer accurate as the server side code that clears the label is never reached. What I want to do and have failed miserably to achive so far is to hide the label on the content page using JavaScript when the client side validation prevents a post back. This should only happen when the validation fails and no post back occurs. When I register a script in the content pages load event, the JavaScript to hide the label always fires, which means that the server errors are never presented to the user. Any ideas on how to achieve thisp  pSummary I only want the JavaScript that clears and hides the label to run when no postback occurs.p

Negative 539 pIm not that good in SQL and Ive come across a problem I dont know how to solve. Ive read and reread parts of a book about SQL OReillys Learning SQL which I hoped would contain the information I needed but I havent found it.p  pMy problem is the following. Ill use a simplified example to make it easier to discuss.p  pIve got three tables, car, rim and the combination of the two carRim.p  precodecar     carId     description  rim     rimId     description  carRim     carRimId     carId     rimId     price codepre  pIn the table carRim I have an extra attribute of price, because the price of a rim is potentially different for every type of car. A constraint I have is that every type of rim should only be coupled once to every type of car. So all combinations of carrim should be unique. p  pIf I want to add a rim to a car I need a list of rims that are not yet coupled to that car. For this I think I need the rim table and the carRim table respectively for the total list of rims and the list of carRims that are already coupled to the car I want to add a rim to.p  pIve written the simple query to make the list of rims that emareem coupled to a specific car, in the following example the car with carId 9.p  precodeSELECT       FROM     rims  INNER JOIN     carRims  ON     carRims.rimId  rim.rimId  WHERE     carRims.carId  9  codepre  pBut now I need the list of rims that are not yet coupled to a specific car. The problem is that if I do a LEFT OUTER JOIN the list I get is tainted with couplings of rims to other cars, so the filter condition of WHERE carRims.carId IS NULL does not work.p  precodeSELECT       FROM     rims  LEFT OUTER JOIN     carRims  ON     carRims.rimId  rim.rimId  WHERE     carRims.carId IS NULL codepre  pAnother challenge is that I cant use any syntax new to MySQL 5, like subqueries, because my client is using MySQL 4 and cant upgrade at this time.p  pCan a query for this problem be written in MySQL 4, I suspect it can.p  pThanksp
Negative 539 pThis problem of mine has me pulling my hair out.  Its related to the issue I had earlier with needing to write a a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2201123needtobeatthegcandhaveobjectdestroyedonceitgoesoutofscopeMutex that will get destroyed when going out of scopea.  It turns out that I was stupid and didnt need the Mutex  the things I needed to lock out wouldnt observe the lock because they were actually being called from the same thread.  I hadnt realized that one set of calls was coming from a Timer.  Oops.p  pAnyhow, Im doing some investigation to try to help narrow down the cause of our problems with that 3rd party DLL.  They seem to believe that if we have multiple copies of their C DLLs well call them a.dll and b.dll for now in different folders, local only to the C assemblies that use them, then life will be good and I can finally go home and actually see my family.p  pThe proposed folder structure looks something like thisp  precodeApp folder    DeviceA.dll    a.dll linked to by DeviceA    b.dll linked to by a.dll    Device B Folder       DeviceB.dll       a.dll       b.dll codepre  pMy problem is that even though DeviceB.dll is in a separate folder, when it is loaded, it doesnt load and look for its dependencies in the Device B Folder  it looks in the App folder instead.  I really need to be able to guarantee that its linking to a totally different DLL than the one thats in the App folder.p  pIve looked into the build properties, read some things on manifests, and havent figured it out yet.  Is this even possible  If I know that DeviceB.dll is in a different folder, do I have to set CurrentDirectory or something similar to force it to link to the DLLs in its own folder, instead of from the executing assemblys folderp  pstrongEDITstrong actually, the a.dll in Device B Folder should be c.dll.  So a.dll links to b.dll, and c.dll links to b.dll.  I cant change this behavior because the 3rd party DLL is already compiled to link to b.dll.p

Negative 539 pI am currently developing a little a hrefhttpgithub.combebrawHarmonyBrushes relnofollowsketching applicationa based on HTML5 Canvas element. There is one particular problem I havent yet managed to find a proper solution for.p  pThe idea is that the user will be able to manipulate existing stroke data points quite freely. This includes pushing point data around ie. magnet tool and manipulating it at whim otherwise ie. altering color.p  pNote that the current brush engine is able to shade by taking existing stroke data in count. Its a quick and dirty solution as it just iterates the points in the current stroke and checks them against a distance rule.p  pNow the problem is how to do this in a nice manner. It is extremely important to be able to perform efficient queries that return all points within given canvas coordinate and radius. Other features, such as space usage, should be secondary to this.

Negative 539 pI have a PHP script that will generate a report using PHPExcel from data queried from a MySQL DB. Currently, it is linear in processing in that it gets the data back from MySQL, reads in the Excel template, writes the data to the template, then outputs it. I have optimized the code to the point that the data is only iterated over once, and there is very little processing done on the PHP side. The query returns hundreds of lines in less than .001 seconds, so it is running fast enough.

Negative 539 pI am trying to manage a drilldown list of data. Ive got an entity, Contact, that has a tomany relationship with another entity, Rule. In my root view controller, I use a fetched results controller to manage and display the list of Contacts. When a Contact is tapped, I push a new view controller onto the stack with a list of the Contacts Rules.p  pI have not been able to figure out how to use a second fetched results controller to display the Rules, so Im using the followingp  precode create a set of the contacts rules rules  [NSMutableSet set] rules  [self.contact mutableSetValueForKeyrule]   create an array of rules from the set arrayOfRules  [NSMutableArray arrayWithCapacity[rules count]] for id oneObject in rules      [arrayOfRules addObjectoneObject]   sort the array of rules NSSortDescriptor descriptor  [[NSSortDescriptor alloc] initWithKeyphoneLabel ascendingYES] [arrayOfRules sortUsingDescriptors[NSArray arrayWithObjectdescriptor]] [descriptor release] codepre  pI create a set of Rules, then use that to create an array of Rules for sorting. I then use these two collections to populate the grouped table view. All of this appears to be working correctly.p  pHeres my problem There are several different actions a user can take in this view, and most of them require that I know which Rule was tapped. But I cant figure out how to get that. For instance, say a user wants to delete a Rule. It seems to me the proper approach is something like...p  precode[rules removeObjectruleObjectToBeRemoved] codepre  p...but I cant figure out how to specifiy ruleObjectToBeRemoved.

Negative 539 pThe well known Command pattern is used often when you want to implement a model with UndoRedo capabilities.   I am looking for a reference implementation example of a simple Delphi form that implements undoredo.p  pFrom what I have seen, simple delphi dataentry forms with three Edit boxes, six memo boxes,  and a few combo boxes and other simple edit controls,  do not typically support UndoRedo.  p  pHas anyone seen a well designed delphi approach to multilevel undoredo support for a complex modelviewcontroller design using a separate Delphi view form, and model objects data objects are updated synchronously with all edits to the form, and the validation and control logic is not embedded in the form, or in the model, but separated out.p  pIt seems to me that if you didnt have to use MVC, and you needed to simply prototype a Delphi demo app that had no model or controller objects, that UndoRedo of a pure simple Delphi oneformismyapp would be simpler to design, but it would get more complicated as you need to record and replay objects and synchronize them to Delphi form actions like TEdit.OnChange.  p

Negative 539 pI have a table view where cells can display a variable amount of information. For example, the first cell could display 2 labels, the next cell 5 labels, and the third cell could display 1 label. The cell contents are stored in managed objects.p  pI would like to make this data driven, where I have a plist to configure the cells. Im thinking that I can create a layout manager that reads in the config data and can intelligently determine how to display the labels. p  pIs there a better way to do this with UIKit I realize that ultimately I could use Core Text to do the text rendering, but I would like for that to be an implementation detail. For starters Id be happy with just have UILabels that are dynamically setup.p  pEDITp  pOne side effect of making this driven from a configuration file is that I could update these configurations after the app has been deployed. I might consider generated xib files for download as well, but ideally Id like to only delivery binary plists.p

Service exposes restartService method and during startup depending on the XML data it will connect to the remote device or will not.

Negative 539 pIve started on my first somewhat serious programming project with PHP and am having a hard time getting good profiling information.  I have used xdebug and cachegrind to profile the code, but it assumes that a functions self execution time is the total time the function takes to execute minus the aggregated time of any functions it calls.p  pWhile this is correct in essence, it does not help as much as it could when Im trying to optimize the code.  For example, I have a simple function with two if statements which returns an array with two values and it takes 26 of the total execution time according to xdebug.  It uses arraykeyexists, and I can see that the execution time of those function calls is around 1.  What I cannot see is how other 25 of the execution time is accounted for with the rest of the code.  How long did it take for the if statements, getting the pair of values, putting those values into an array, and returning the arrayp  pIs there some xdebug flag which I missed in the documentation  Or is there a profiling tool for PHP which will profile variable assignments, operators, the construction of the basic data types, and other nonfunctional calls  Preferably, something that does not assume that the script is available via a web server.p  pAn example of something along the lines of what Im looking for is a hrefhttptimbunce.files.wordpress.com200807nytprofperlcriticallperlfiles.pngw663amph552nytprofa for perl.  Note that it profiles every single line of code within the function besides the last push, which never gets executed.p

Negative 539 pI have a graph emGem which consists only of star graphs.  A star graph consists of one central node having edges to every other node in it.  Let emHsub1sub, Hsub2sub,hellip,Hsubnsubem be different star graphs of different sizes which are present in emGem.  We call the set of all nodes which are centres in any star graph emRem.p  pNow suppose these star graphs are building edges to other star graphs such that no edge is incident between any nodes in emRem.  Then, how many edges exist at maximum between the nodes in emRem and the nodes which are not in emRem, if the graph should remain planarp  pI want the upper bound on the number of such edges.  One upper bound that I have in mind is consider them as bipartite planar graph where emRem is one set of vertices and rest of the vertices form another set emAem.  We are interested in edges between these sets emRem and emAem.  Since it is planar bipartite, the number of such edges is bounded by twice the number of nodes in emGem.p  pWhat I feel is that is there a better bound, maybe twice the nodes in emAem plus the number of nodes in emRem.p  pIn case you can disprove my intuition, then that would also be good.  Hopefully some of you can come up with a good bound along with some relevant arguments.p

Negative 539 pI am attempting to use RMagick to convert an SVG to a PNG of a different size.p  pWhen I read in the SVG with codeMagickImage.readdrawing.svgcode and write it out to drawing.png the equivalent of just running codeconvert drawing.svg drawing.pngcode from the command line, the size is 744x1052.p  pLets suppose I want the PNG to be twice as large as it is by default. You cant just read it in, resize it, then write it out, as that first rasterizes the SVG and then scales that image to be twice as large, losing quality and the entire benefit of using a vector graphic in the first place.  So instead, if I understand correctly, youre supposed to set the images density upon read.p  precodeimage  MagickImage.readdrawing.svgself.density  144.first codepre  pBut codeimage.densitycode still reports the density as 72x72, and if I write out the image it has the same size as before, 744x1052. It doesnt seem to matter how I specify the density upon read. With 144, 144, 144.0, 144.0, 144x144, and 144.0x144.0, it always comes back 72x72.p  pRunning codeconvert density 144 drawing.svg drawing.pngcode from the command line works as expected and generates a PNG thats twice as large as before, 2104x1488.p  pIm using OS X 10.6.7, ImageMagick 6.7.00 installed via MacPorts, RMagick 2.13.1, and Ruby 1.9.2p180. When I put my code into the context of a little Sinatra webapp on Heroku, it has the same incorrect behavior, so the issue does not seem to lie with OS X or MacPorts.p

Negative 539 pIm trying to figure out the best way of writing a unit test for an overridden method which calls super as the last step.

The base class has several dependencies, and its really not necessary to test that class not to mention a lot more work. p  pComposition is a solution, but its a fairly complicated base class and I need to expose the whole thing while only overriding a couple of methods. p  pIm also considering faking the base class for testing, which is simple enough, but Im not sure how to change the classpath just for running the unit test Eclipse for single tests Maven for build testing  maybe a question on its own.p  phr  I have to imagine this has already been asked, but I cant find an exact match. p

Negative 539 pI figure, given a week and Red Bull, I could make something that does this, but first, I wanted to find out if it had been done already. p  pI know input masks already exist For example, codecode. So you can just type a date, and voila, code12312010code. p  pHowever, if I were to go in and realize I meant to put December 20th, I go to the 3 in 31, hit delete once, and now it displays code1212010code. Thats not very helpful. Its because the internal value is still simply 12312010, so when you delete 3 it becomes 1212010, and that is inserted into the mask accordingly.p  pIs there any existing JavaScript mask that will enforce blocks So that, if I did what I described above, it would then display code1212010code I dont mind if it still submits as 1212010, as long as it displays properly. p  pWould prefer a jQuery plugin, but straight JavaScript works.p

Negative 539 pI cant find a way to intercept the beginning of the drag operation in SLToolkit I need that in order for my custom controls to indicate the regions where the item could be dropped. Unfortunately, there is no IsDragInProgressChanged event I looked at the sources and the only way I found was to subclass all DragDropTargetlt,s and override OnItemDragStarting method, which, in my opinion, is way too complicated and intrusive. Anyone knows of a better methodp
Negative 539 pI already asked this question in the jQuery forum but I didnt get an answer. Ive got a problem with the initialization of the jScrollPane plugin. I set up a test site to illustrate it a hrefhttpherrmondl.multimediaart.atnotwebsitetesttest.html relnofollowhttpherrmondl.multimediaart.atnotwebsitetesttest.htmlap  pClicking on a picture should update the entire left DIV. The first time you click on a picture works well but repeating this process makes the Bio section disappear. This is definitely because of a wrong initialization of the jScrollPane plugin.  If you reload the website and click on Urkel at first youll see the custom scrollbar. p  pSo heres the buggy code for calling the hover and click eventsp  precodediv.artistImg a.hoverfunction       var currArtist  this.parent.finddiv.artistName,         clicked  currArtist.hasClassartistActive      if clicked          currArtist.stop.csstop, 30px.show.animate             top 0px         , fast      , function       ifclicked             currArtist.stop                .css                    display block,                    top0px                                    .animatetop 30px, fast     .bindclick, functione      div.artistActive.removeClassartistActive     this.parent.finddiv.artistName.addClassartistActive      .artistWrap .artistDates.cssdisplay, none     e.preventDefault     div.firstDates.hide.htmlthis.hash.html.fadeInslow       var api  .artistBio.jScrollPane         showArrows false,         verticalGutter 1,          api.reinitialise  codepre  pBasically this code handles a hover animation and the click event. As you can see in the code it should also handle the mouseout animation which also seems not to work.p  pAny help to get the initialization right would be appreciated and if you get the mouseout stuff working too you will be my hero. p

Negative 539 pI have an http API which shockingly new technique reacts on different errors setting different response statuses.p  pThe question is  while using Ext.data.Store with some XMLHttpRequestinside proxy, what is the best way to handle this statuses As far as I can understand, load event does not pass status directly, as well as exception, and the last one actually doesnt even trigger when 4 status is received. p  pSo, as I can see from code xhr instance is hidden from Ext.data.store, so the question is also can be stated as What is best extjs practice to handle lowlevel xhr object.p

Negative 539 pIve come to the conclusion that ActiveRecord automatically calls toi on its argument, but would appreciate if anybody can confirm, particularly through a reference to some documentation.p  pThe way I came to the conclusion is best illustrated with the following code samplep  precodedesttask  WorkEffort.findparams[taskdestid]  params[tasksrcids].split.each do srcid     WorkEffort.findsrcid.movetochildof desttask end codepre  pWhen I ran the above only the record associated with the first srcid was processed although I knew the tasksrcids parameter contained something such as 78,79.  Thinking it through, find must be calling toi on that string, which will ignore everything after the first nondigit and return 78.  p  pIf find wasnt calling toi an error should have resulted, and I would have to call toi explicitly.  I of course fixed the code by calling split, and now it processes multiple tasksrcids instead of just the one that comes before the first comma.p  pI know Ive sort of answered this myself, but as a RubyRails newbie am looking for confirmation, and a link to relevant documentation, plus I thought it could help out others in the future.  Thanks in advancep
Negative 539 pI have two machines A1 and A2, both of which are running the same embedded code, which broadcast packets. The third machine, B3, is a Windows XP box running a C .NET 4.0 app, which listens for those broadcasts.  p  pAll of the data from A1 is received by the C as expected, 95 of the data from A2 is received with intermittent, seemingly random, lost UDP datagrams.p  pWhen I look on wireshark on B3, all of the packets from both machines arrive exactly as expected, but when I dump the bytes to a text file immediately after receiving them, I see that datagrams from B2 are missing.p  pHow can it be that a packet is displayed on wireshark, but does not get passed to my C app, some of the time  I could understand if the datagram had bad headers, etc., but Wireshark shows everything as expected, even for these missing ones. Does Windows  .NET perform some check that Wireshark does not by default p

Negative 539 pI wrote a sql join query in oracle with two table. While writing query I did not use any table alias to refer column in select clause. Now this was possible because the selected columns were having different names in both the tables.p  pSo the question follows is it necessary from performance point of view to use a table alias to select column regardless there is any similar column name in both the tables p  pPlease note Right now I am under impression that In case of join query when we do not specify table alias to select column oracle will always lookup the table metadata to find out which table has this column. strongemSo is my assumption trueemstrongp  pThanks, hanumantp

Negative 539 pI am investigating if the functionality of some CGI scripts written in Perl that we run on a web server can be migrated to our Sharepoint 2007 server MOSS. p  pThe CGI scripts are not complicated. Basically they display and process contents of files that resides in the network file system.  For instance one script just displays the contents of small text files that are being added to a specific folder.  These files are part of a production process and cannot be moved into a Sharepoint document archive.  The CGI scripts are being used to give an overview on what is new in the queue for this production process.  When the production process has finished, it removes the files from the folder. But new files may arrive to the folder at any time.p  pI have done some investigations and found that using a Data View web part would give possibilities of displaying the data in a good way.  The files need to be transformed from text to XML format, before some xslt could make it look good in a Data View WP. I guess that could be done by some kind of serverside script  But how and where do I add such a script to Sharepoint p  pWould it be a good idea implementing this as an RSS feed instead But an RSS feed would also require a serverside script, wouldnt it p  pI am new to Sharepoint development and would appreciate any useful advice.p

Negative 539 pWe are writing a program that takes input from a webcam, substracts all color except the green values, finds the seperated BLOBs and numerates them. Eventually, this will be used as an input for a video game, but that is irrelevent right now.p  pThe code in question is not the code that actually does all of this, but instead, a rewritten segment of the code to test how FindContours actually works.  Usually, with imageprocessing, we have been tought that the image is read from top left to bottom right, but after some testing, it seems that it does the exact opposite, starting at the lower right corner and moving to the upper leftp  pSo the question here is In which order does FindContours find its Contours Am I right in my assumption or is it my own code confusing me p  pInput a hrefhttpi32.photobucket.comalbumsd37EthaloxBlobtest06.png relnofollowBlobtest06ap  pa hrefhttpi32.photobucket.comalbumsd37EthaloxComponents.jpg relnofollowComponents windowap  pa hrefhttpi32.photobucket.comalbumsd37EthaloxConsole.jpg relnofollowConsoleap  precodeinclude ltopencv2opencv.hppgt include ltiostreamgt include ltopencv2coremat.hppgt include ltWindows.hgt for sleep function  using namespace cv using namespace std  void IsolateGreenMat mIn, Matamp mOut  Mat inImg mIn.rows, mIn.cols, CV8UC3, Scalar1,2,3 inImg.data  mIn.data Mat channelRed inImg.rows, inImg.cols, CV8UC1 Mat channelGreen inImg.rows, inImg.cols, CV8UC1 Mat channelBlue inImg.rows, inImg.cols, CV8UC1 Mat outImg[]  channelRed, channelGreen, channelBlue  int fromTo[]   0,2, 1,1, 2,0 mixChannels ampinImg, 1, outImg, 3, fromTo, 3  mOut  channelGreen  channelRed  channelBlue  thresholdmOut, mOut, 5, 255, THRESHBINARY  erodemOut, mOut, Mat, Point 1,1, 1 dilatemOut, mOut, Mat, Point1,1, 2    void FindContoursMatamp mDst, Mat mGreenScale, vectorltvectorltPointgtgtamp vecContours, vectorltVec4igtamp vecHierarchy, Mat img  This is empty at all times.

Negative 539 pI know there are hundreds of questions towards web development and many of these cover scala and lift. However thats just the reason for my question p  pyou could skip this background informationp  pIm planning on putting up a simple website. I dont have much time for this and its rather a personal playgroung than a real project. Since Im a huge fan of scala I figured it would be great to use it for the project. No need to tell me that this means work but theres no deadline. Now I only have to decide which framework to use. I have looked into lift and play and various javascript libraries. The final outcome is I prefer lift over play because it is in my humble opinion more scalaish. I still need something to get the client side pleasant to look at. Therefore I was very happy when I heard about scala support for gwt. Ive already took a glimpse at gwt but theres so much out there that I really got no time for trying it all out. The possibility to avoid programming in javascript itself is at least to me very appealing. So I decided to search for some opinions gwt.p  pI found this question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3948067whichisbetterframeworkjavagwtorscalaliftWhich is better framework JavaGWT or ScalaLiftap  pUp to now I thought gwt only produced javascript and was therefore strictly clientside. Can I mix the gwt and lift Is this a good idea or likely to produce dirty code. I dont want to get everything messed up with too powerful frameworks. Hopefully you get my meaning.p  pIf you have bad experience with either of them or some good advice how to get going, Id appreciate it if youd let me know.p  pThank you for your timep

Negative 539 pWere building an application for product support. The idea is to have multiple subdomains, each for supporting other organizations products. We call this Account  each account is tied to exactly one subdomain. Users also have roles  but, user can have one role on account1, and other role on account2.p  pBasically, there are two problemsp  p1 many validations are based on the role current user has. Since it depends on currentaccount which is session data, I cannot do these kinds of validations in the model. This leads me to some ugly controller code ugly, in the sense that it really feels out of place. I thought of storing currentaccount after in the model class variable, but I read that this is not thread safe. Any recommendationsp  p2 almost every database record is specific to the current account so, almost every table should have an accountid column and the model should have a belongsto account association. I want to avoid that. The first obvious thing is to have a seperate database for every account, but p  pa there are shared tables p  pb the boss says this solution is unacceptable there will be many accounts, with relatively low number of users. Is there a third wayp

There are 1k doubles in each string, so 3k by object, and there are something like 3k objects just to give you an idea of a typical case.p  pWhen I read the data, I most get all the doubles from the objets and add them to the same list. I made an object that contains three doubles one for each string in a foreach, I get every objects and I split my strings into arrays. After that, I loop to turn my arrays into a list of objects that contains three doubles and I add it all to one list so I can use it for further operations. p  pIt causes an out of memory exception before the end.

Negative 539 pI have a big problem with new LogCat and its pause functionality. I like the idea to pause the output, when I want to read some older entries from it.p  pBut there are also times when I want output to flow uninterrupted, so I can touch the phone, and see how it reacts through reading the output. So it is very frustrating to me, that LogCat pauses completely very often the pause button is getting pressed automatically. I then have to unpause it using mouse or scrolling up and down in LogCat window, then it pauses again after just a few seconds. It annoys the hell out of me. Why does it happen It happened with adt 15 and it is happening now with adt 17 I skipped 16.p  pIm using eclipse 3.7 indygo under xubuntu 10.4 dont think that matters, but maybe it is.p  pAny of you experiencing the same problems with newer LogCat Any idea how to solve itp  pcheers, kajmanp

Negative 539 pI have a product listing page and want to load up a detail view for each product via AJAX and display it within the page. I have a more complex set of conditions I want to set up animations with, but Ill keep it simple here.p  pBasically, upon click, I want to run the AJAX request and simultaneously animate in some cases, a series of animations... the content wrapper open and show a loading state. Once BOTH of those are done, I then want to drop in, and animate the content. I thought jQuery Deferred Objects would be the way to go, but I dont have a good grasp on them and my attempts havent gotten me where I want to be.p  pI tried something like thisp  precodevar dfr  .Deferred dfr.thenfunction  return wrapper.fadeIn5000   .whendfr, .getdetail.html .thenfunction      console.logAll done, run additional animations...   dfr.resolve codepre  p... but it gets triggered as soon as the AJAX request is done, even if the animation is still running.p  pI also tried thisp  precodevar dfr  .Deferred dfr.thenfunction  return wrapper.fadeIn5000  dfr.thenfunction  return .getdetail.html  dfr.donefunction  console.logAll done, run additional animations...  dfr.resolve codepre  p... but that just executes all of the codethencodecodedonecode calls simultaneously. I also tried switching in codepipecode in place of the codethencode calls, to no avail.p  pI would love to understand Deferred Objects is this even an appropriateintended use for them.. and, of course, how I can achieve my goals for this page. Any help or tips are much appreciated....p

Negative 539 pIn a Python program Im writing, Ive built up a linked list using a dictionary which maps each node to its successor with the last node mapped to None.p  pActually, the dictionary holds what Wikipedia tells me is called a a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiSpaghettistack relnofollowspaghetti stacka, which is a tree where each node is linked to its parent but not its children. This means there are many partiallyoverlapping paths from the leaf nodes to the root node. I only care about one of those paths, starting from a specific leaf node.

Negative 539 pIve been asked to remove months from the month dropdown on our jQuery datepicker if there are no flights that month.  My initial thinking is, in the strongbeforeShowstrong event, to add a change event handler to the strongyearstrong dropdown that will go off and call a function called, say, monthHasFlights for each month in that year calling it manually the first time the datepicker loads.  I will then remove that month if monthHasFlights returns false.  strongProblem isstrong ... my handler wont attach.  p  pSo, inside the beforeShow event handler I have this p  precode.uidatepickeryear.changefunctionsetDropdownMonths codepre  pbut the event never attaches, even though I see this line execute in firebugtools  My understanding of jQuery event binding is that you can assign to the change event as many times as you like and the handlers will fire in the order you create them.. but I guess Ive got that wrong  Is it simply that the dropdown does not yet exist when I try to attach the event handler  I did try a setTimeout of 100 but my event still doesnt attach.

Negative 539 pI have a CellList with AbstractCell. There are some text fields and one picture for each record, just like friend list, everybody has hisher own picture. In GWT showcase, the CellList sample gives one picture to all person with AbstractImagePrototype.createimageResource. It is not a real world case. How to show these pictures in GWT p  pI tried for 1 night with ClientBundle, only got result like 1 static picture in 1 main panel. Also, I dont know where these pictures should be placed, in MySqls Blob column or just in file system. Can you give me some suggestion on GWT side or server side Thanks a lot.p  pJust now, I saw someone suggested a servlet on server side to provide these pictures. But it will cause another server access, and another permission check should be done on it. Can these pictures be downloaded with text data of CellList and show in browser together thanks.p  pIn 2.5rc, AbstractCell can work with UiRender with ui.xml. If it works with ui.xml fine, it will be the best solution.p

Negative 539 pI noticed that C jitter produces measurably slower code than C compiler, even if there are no managed overhead constructs used such as arrays with checked indexing.p  pTo quantify it, I timed the following simple loopp  precodepublic static int count  1000000000 public static int Main      int j  0     for int i  0 i lt count i              j  i  2  0  i  7 gtgt 3  i  7          return j  codepre  pThis loop takes 3.88s to execute compiled with o. Equivalent loop compiled with VC 2010 O2 takes 2.95s.p  pTo verify that inferior code was actually generated I compared machine codes created a listing FAs from VC compiler, and attached a debugger to C program after the loop was completed.p  pIndeed, C version is using some clever tricks. For example to avoid costly multiplication by 7, there is a separate register that is incremented by 7 every loop count. C version does the multiplication imul every time. There are other differences as well.p  pI understand that C jitter has a lot less time to compile the code at runtime than VC at build time. But e.g. Java jitter is dynamically optimizing frequently used methods. C doesnt seem to be doing it.p  pMy question is are there plans to improve C jitter in the future framework versionsp

Following is the screenSHot of listView Item img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comFPRig.png altList View Itemp  pThe problem arises when the .jpeg file from sdCard is converted to a bitmap i.e. strongBitmapFactory.decodeFilefileNamestrong  and then gets assigned to an image View using strongsetImageBitmapBitmap bmpstrong. As the setting bitmap image to an image view is a lengthy process it cannot keep pace with the scroll listener implementation and the ImageView of different ListView rows gets populated with the image it was assigned to any row above. Can anybody please suggest some workout to cater this issue specifically the assignment of images from SD Card to an imageView. Its not like my listView item is overLoaded with controls that is why i am facing this problem. I also have tried it with single ImageView item inside each row and it behaves the same way. Your suggestion to improvise this are welcome and surely will be of great help.

Negative 539 pA site I am working on has a lot of images that are pulled from a database. The dimensions of the images are not consistent and I am trying to display them in uniformly sized boxes divs. I do not know the dimensions of any of the images but I can retrieve them withp  precodedocument.getElementById myImage .width document.getElementById myImage .height codepre  pAfter this I do my tests to see how to resize images to fit the uniform boxes. Finally I set the effects withp  precodedocument.getElementById myImage .width  theNewWidth document.getElementById myImage .height  theNewHeight codepre  pThis function is only called once per image by using codeonloadresizingFunction imgId code in the img tag. It takes about 12 seconds for every image in the database to complete this function and the function is never run for any of those images again. Despite never running again, the site runs significantly slower if I use this function. After googling I tried addingp  precodedocument.getElementById myImage .removeAttributewidth document.getElementById myImage .removeAttributeheight codepre  pBefore setting the new width and height. This did improve the speed but it is still slower than if I had not resized the images. Again, just for clarification, each image is resized one time after it has been loaded but for some reason this still slows down the site.p  pImages are created by being PHP echoed into JavaScript. This is necessary because they need information from the database PHP, and the JavaScript places them inside the correct box div.

That is, so that both Visitor and visit are declared for codevirtual void acceptVisitor v vgtvisitthiscode. But at the same time, ASTVisitor.h needs AST.h so that the Visitor class knows that all concrete subclasses of Node exist. That is, so that, for instance, StringElement is declared for the signature in codevirtual void visitStringElement ecodep  pBut including ASTVisitor.h in AST.h and AST.h in ASTVisitor.h results in the Visitor class not being seen by the Node class and therefore, not being valid as a type for accepts parameter. Also, doing a forward declaration, like codeclass Visitorcode in AST.h only solves the type problem for the method signature, but inside the method codevgtvisitthiscode is still invalid since the forward declaration says nothing about the methods for the Visitor class.p  pSo whats the C way of solving thisp

Negative 539 pIm working on adding logging to a project using Windsor Logging Facility and the NLog integration.p  pRather than following the Windsor documentations recommended practice of adding a codeLogcode property to every class for which I want to support logging, Ive decided to try to go the route of using dynamic interception to do it. So far the interceptors fairly basic it just uses constructor injection to get an instance of codeILoggercodep  precodeclass LoggingInterceptor  IInterceptor      private readonly ILogger logger     public LoggingInterceptorILogger logger              if logger  null throw new ArgumentNullExceptionlogger         logger  logger           public void InterceptIInvocation invocation               just a placeholder implementation, Im not actually planning to do this          logger.Infoinvocation.Method.Name         invocation.Proceed         codepre  pBeyond that, all Ive done is the minimum for registering the interceptor and applying it to a component, and the logging facility takes care of the rest.p  precodecontainer.RegisterComponent.ForltLoggingInterceptorgt.LifeStyle.Transient  container.Register     Component.ForltIEmployeeRepositorygt     .ImplementedByltEmployeeRepositorygt     .InterceptorsInterceptorReference.ForTypeltLoggingInterceptorgt.First codepre  pSo far so good  sort of.  The logger I get follows NLogs recommended practice of one logger per class.  I dont think thats a very good choice in this case. It means that every single message is going to a log named MyApplication.Interceptors.LoggingInterceptor, which isnt terribly useful.p  pId prefer to have logs named after the abstraction the logger has been applied to.  For example, if the logger has been applied to an implementation of codeIEmployeeRepositorycode then the log should be named codeEmployeeRepositorycode.  Is this doablep  pstrongEditstrong Ive tried implementing a custom codeILoggerFactorycode and instructing the container to use it instead.  However I quickly hit a roadblock When Windsor calls into the factory, the only information supplied is the type of the object for which the logger is being acquired.  No other information about the object is supplied, so the codeILoggerFactorycode has no way of finding out about the abstraction the interceptor has been applied to.p  pI notice that there are two overloads of codeILoggerFactory.Createcode that accept strings as arguments.  Windsor doesnt seem to be using either of them directly, but one would assume that they have to be there for a reason. Is there anything in the fluent registration API that can be used to specify that a particular string be usedp

Negative 539 pNewbie stackoverflow participant, newbie 3D programmer, and far from a math wiz... so Ill try to frame this question as clearly as I can, hoping it makes sense, and hoping for an answer thats not a mile over my head.p  pIve written a very cool app using three.js that lets the user fly through 3D space and explore a solar system. The flight model is loosely based on the Fly.Controller exampleextension in the three.js package which taught me to use quaternions for keeping all the axis rotations sensible relative to each other. The flying part all works great.p  pHeres my dilemma When using quaternions, how do I deduce the normal I dont know what else to call it rotation values to determine which direction I am facing When using quaternions, the rotation structure inside the camera object stays at 0,0,0.

Is there a built in three.js function, or other easy way to convert thisp  pIve found some similar, confusing, pointers on the web, but nothing I can decipher and put to use in three.js. Thanks.p

Negative 539 pI am working on an app for OSX Lion and onwards. The app has a root daemon process. I have created a systemwide keychain using SecKeychainCreate in LibraryKeychains which is accessible only by the daemon and wish to store generic keys in that keychain.

Negative 539 pI have almost finished my iPhone app, which revolves around social networking. I have come across an issue... Each value which is printed, friends, friend requests etc are printed onto a website, from a SQL Database, and then the iPhone reads this and renders it into a UILabel via echo. The issue that I am having is that its ok for Jim to have Bob, Josh and John listed in his friends as one label, but when I want to view Johns profile by clicking on his name, I cant use the UILabels value because itll be Bob, Josh and John Is there anyway to basically get each row printed into a separate UILabel. I have tried putting some validation on the webpage for example bobvalidatejoshvalidatejohnvalidate but I dont know how to get the iPhone to detect the validate and print the values inbetween in onto an individual label. I hope im making sense Thanks in advancep

Negative 539 pIm trying to implement my own cancellationpoint mechanism in C. The code is mainly targeted at Linux but I hope it to be portable among POSIX systems.p  pFor obvious reason, every blocking system call must be a cancellation point, otherwise the thread may block forever and nothing will be able to wake it up. Currently I use signal to achieve that. When a thread receives a special signal representing a cancellation request, the signal handler sets up a threadlocal flag. If that thread is blocked on some system call it will fail with codeerrno  EINTRcode. Then it will have chance to check the flag.p  pBut soon I found the above method isnt perfect. If the signal comes first, and then the thread enters the blocking system call, it gets into forever blocking as well. Checking the flag before each blocking call doesnt make things good enough. The signal may come just after the checkp  precodeifcancelled     throw CancellationException   lt The signal comes here. gt  blockingcall codepre  pHeres my problem Is there a way to make sure when I enter a system call, the cancellation flag is not set If not, what is the common practice to design such cancellation pointsp

Negative 539 phalo there, p  pI am using VS 2010 and I have a winform client app and a wcf service. From my client, i will call wcf service. I implemented callback functionality and using netnamedpipe binding. I called a service method. This method is having a list of UserAccount object inside. This method will iterate through each UserAccount object and call a long runing propcess. At the end of each process, it will fire the event [callback] to notify the status of process. I am planning to do using a background worker for each process of UserAccount object. But Rx reactive framework is having something more credible functionalities which meets this requirement. Is there any parallel execution is possible in this case using RX  I just invoke the wcf service call. The service method is doing all these long running process and report each process status back to the client code [where callback is implemented in the client].p  precode1.

Negative 539 pI have a multiprocess PHP CLI application that runs continuously. Originally, I was using the standard Ubuntu 10.04 package build of PHP 5.3.21ubuntu4.18.

Is it possible that I am missing some php extension which somehow optimizes the script to use less computing resources Or is the Ubuntu build perhaps optimized for the Ubuntu architecture, whereas my custom build is lacking these optimizations If so, how can I figure out which optimizations are used in the Ubuntu build, in order to recreate them in my bare bones buildp  pHere is a snippet of the output from codeps aux  grep phpcode, which is used to demonstrate my point in the comments belowp  precoderoot  12952  0.3  0.9  33176  4968 pts2    S    Feb14  1115 s.php 5 root  12955  0.3  0.9  32664  4732 pts2    S    Feb14  1112 s.php 5 root  12958  0.3  0.9  32664  4796 pts2    S    Feb14  1051 s.php 5 root  12961  0.3  0.9  32740  4752 pts2    S    Feb14  1107 s.php 5 root  14162  0.3  0.9  33000  4904 pts2    S    Feb14  1051 s.php 5 root  14165  0.3  1.0  33256  5340 pts2    S    Feb14  1056 s.php 5 root  23426  9.5  1.1  13492  6040 pts2    S    Feb15 15138 s.php 1  codepre

Negative 539 h1The original questionh1  pRecent versions of Haskell  7.4.2 come with an mtl package that no longer provides a State constructor per se, instead providing a state function.p  pThis messes up the examples of State in the wikibooks page here a hrefhttpen.wikibooks.orgwikiHaskellUnderstandingmonadsState relnofollowhttpen.wikibooks.orgwikiHaskellUnderstandingmonadsStateap  pCould someone show how to revise the example following heading Introducing State Thats the small functions rollDie and rollDice.p  pTheres a Note box earlier on the page, near heading Definition of the State Monad which describes in general what to do, but its too vague for me.p  pAlso, Im not quite clear on how imports and packages work, so a possible related thing critical to this example may be specifying what imports are needed, as they too may have changed.p  pThanksp  h1Source codeh1  precode Adding code for ghci01.hs   httpen.wikibooks.orgwikiHaskellUnderstandingmonadsState  Introducing State heading and below  import Control.Monad import System.Random  type GeneratorState  State StdGen  rollDie  GeneratorState Int rollDie  do generator lt get              let value, newGenerator  randomR 1,6 generator              put newGenerator              return value   Test rollDie  evalState rollDie mkStdGen 0  rollDice  GeneratorState Int, Int rollDice  liftM2 , rollDie rollDie   Test rollDice  evalState rollDice mkStdGen 666   In GHCi  ghcigt l dice01.hs [1 of 1] Compiling Main              dice01.hs, interpreted  dice01.hs723 Not in scope type constructor or class State dice01.hs1027 Not in scope get dice01.hs1214 Not in scope put Failed, modules loaded none. codepre  h1Addendumh1  pFor others who stumble in herep  pThe main topic of this question revolves around the nonworking example code, and the warning in the Note box on the wikibooks page referenced above. That box tells that for MTL version  2.0.0.0, some of the example code wont work due to change in Control.Monad.State.p  pMy test involved Haskell Platform 2012.4.0.0, which includes GHC 7.4.2, and MTL which I belatedly discovered to be  1.1.1.1, based on the mtl.cabal file. So, the Notes warning should not apply, but nonethless the example code did not work.  The change recommended by answers here change import Control.Monad to Control.Monad.State did fix the problem.  But evidently that was fixing a problem that pertained to some earlier change, not to the MTL 2.x referenced in the Note.p  pIve since looked at the source for GHC 7.6.2, and there I dont find an MTL library at all. Instead the Staterelated files are in librariestransformersControlMonadTransState. I then took a bunch of confusing detours, including the problem that currently there is no Haskell Platform that uses GHC later than 7.4.2 ie no 7.6.2.p  pThen I found the MTL docs a hrefhttpwww.haskell.orghaskellwikiMonadTransformerLibrary relnofollowhttpwww.haskell.orghaskellwikiMonadTransformerLibrarya which point to this stackoverflow QampA a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2769487mtltransformersmonadsfdmonadlibandtheparadoxofchoicemtl, transformers, monadsfd, monadLib, and the paradox of choicea ... which sort of explains a lot, at least as of 23 years ago. p

Negative 539 pI have a gallery of JPEG images Im trying to manage using PHPs GD.  One particular JPEG image is giving me trouble.  It identifies itself with dimensions of 32,768 x 1,024 pixels.  The image is only 1.9 MB on disk.  Its handled fine by other image processing tools like Finder and Preview on my Mac, and ImageMagick.  Yet, when my system calls codeimagecreatefromjpegcode on it, I get a classic Allowed memory size exhausted fatal exception.  I believe the image is corrupted.  Its supposed to be a 1024x1024 snapshot of a web page, created with codewkhtmltoimagecode.p  pOrdinarily the answer to this is to increase PHPs codememorylimitcode.

Negative 539 pWe have some data that we are trying to synchronize between N machines and a centralized server, and Im looking for a way to do this that is relatively efficient and robust.p  pLooking around, it appears that this is called a set reconciliation problem.  Its good to have a label for it, but searching on that turns up a lot of fairly academic work, which is at times a bit difficult to gauge in terms of its usefulness for emourem data, which is best described as contact lists in terms of its properties objects people with multiple fields that do get updated, but not that often.p  pOur system involves a central server and machines connected to it.  The central server, ideally, is the good copy.  A feature thats nice to have also, is the ability to force the machines to resend by tweaking something on the server.p  pSo far, my thinking is along the lines of a UUID for each object and something like a version or timestamp per object and or per collection of objects to use to tell which data to attempt to synchronize... but my thinking is still a bit fuzzy, and I thought asking would probably lead to a better solution than trying to invent this on my own.p

Negative 539 pIm developing a managed C application that will interface with another companys product.  Their product is .net based, and the main API to use comes from a .net assembly, called foo.dll.p  pMy application requires their products to be installed first.  Installing their products yeilds three different applications, each in thier own directory, each with their own bin directory, and each with local copies of the same .dll files, so you could findp  precodeCcompanyproduct1binfoo.dll   Ccompanyproduct2binfoo.dll   Ccompanyproduct3binfoo.dll   codepre  pThe companys told us which .dlls to use, and which ones they havent put in the GAC when you install their product.  Currently, I can get my application to run by copying their .dlls into my bin directory after building.  Now that Im looking to create an installer for my product, though, Im running into difficulty finding an elegant way to deal with this.  Assuming their API doesnt change, I should be able to run against most versions of their product, so long as the .dll I have matches the one their product is using on that machine.p  pObviously, the ideal solution would be for them to put these assemblies in the GAC when you install their product, particularly since they share them themselves, but this isnt likely to happen, as their product is still immature, with lots of more important problems, and what they do works for them.p  pSo Im left with the problem of how to find and use the .dll I need when I install my product.  The options Ive come up with so far are the followingp  ol lipInclude their .dlls in my installerp  ul liBad, because this locks me to a particular build of their software, and were getting incremental development builds from them anyway, which wont match their public release.li ulli lipHave my installer locate their installation directory and run gacutil.exe and whatever else is needed to put the .dlls in the GAC.p  ul liBad, because gacutil.exe is only supposed to be for development, and it means wed have to include it in our installer and install it along with our own product.  It could also then interfere with their products finding the assemblies.li ulli lipHave my installer locate their installation directory and copy the .dlls I need into my own directories.p  ul liSimple, it works, but is inelegant, and means my application could break if their product has even a minor update made to it until the new .dlls are copied over.  Id also like to avoid the need to copy files around.li ulli lipUse the code I found at a hrefhttpwww.roelvanlisdonk.nlp713 relnofollowhttpwww.roelvanlisdonk.nlp713a to programatically add their install directory to my applications .net search path at runtime.p  ul liReasonaby simple if it works, but more code to maintain.  So far it seems the only route to automatically load the dlls from their directory.li ulli ol  pManaged C and .net is still relatively new to me, most of my coding has been linuxbased C.  The feeling I have, is that its going to be very difficult, because the other company isnt correctly managing how they use their .net assemblies if they want other people to be able to develop against them.p  pHas anyone with more experience had to deal with something like this and found a way around itp

And I wonder can I in some way determine OS type from which this request was sent by http content or something else I know i can add specific field as a parameter to the request but I dont like such a solution. I know there is a way to determine an OS type via mobile browser. May be  similar idea can be used for my mobile applications or each mobile OS add some specific information to the http request or whatever. Thanks in advancep

But sender is component itself so the case is still open.

Negative 539 pI have got some code online which captures video from the camera of iPhone and then stores it to a video file and it is working fine. But my purpose is not to save it in the memory, but to send it to a sever.

By reading some of the documents about Apple HSL I also came to know that it gives a different url in the playlist file for each segment of the media file which is then played in the correct order on a device through the browser.

Negative 539 pIm running into some considerable speed bottlenecks with a PythonMatplotlibXcode combination. I know some immediate responses will probably ask Why are you doing python stuff in Xcode, just man up and use vim  I like the organizing ability and the built in version control, it makes elements of my work easier to deal with.p  pGetting python to run in xcode in the first place was a bit more tricky than I had hoped, but its possible. Now I have the following scenariop  pA master file, main.py does all the import stuff for me and sets up some universal formatting to make all the figures for eventual inclusion in my PhD  thesis nice and uniform. Afterwards it runs a series of execfile commands to generate whichever graphics I need. Two things I can think of right off the batp  p1 at the very beginning of main.py after I import all the normal python stuff you tend to need, I call a system script which checks whether a certain filesystem is mounted. I keep all my climate model data on there since my local hard drive is too small to deal with all of it at once. Python pauses itself and waits for the system to do its thing, but once the filesystem has been found, it keeps going. Usually this only needs to happen once in the morning when I get to work, or if the VPN server kicked me off for whatever reason. Side question, itd be cool to know if theres a trick to automate an VPN login to reconnect as soon as it notices its not connectedp  p2 Im not sure how much xcode is using on its own. running the same program from terminal is somewhat faster. Ive tried to be memory conscience and turn off stuff I dont need while running the pythonxcode combination. p  pAlso, python launches a little window whenever I call plt.show, this in itself takes time, Ive considered just saving them as quick png files and opening them with some other viewer, although I guess that would also have to somehow take time to open up. Given how often these graphics change as I add model runs or think of nicer ways of displaying the data, itd be nice to not waste something on the order of 15 to 30 minutes possibly more out of the entire day twiddling my thumbs and waiting for a window to pop up.p

Negative 539 pSo, this question has come up a few times, generally with inputs and most are in MVC3. Im hoping things have changed. Im using jquery and autocomplete, and want to save  value instead of the label. However, the users need to see the meaningful label, not the random numbers in a primary key users dont care about.p  pMaybe its because I started in webforms, but im amazed that MVC controls seem to have completely lost the concept of separating value from text. Amazed enough to think the problem is probably Im missing something, p  pSo how do I save the value and display the label of a selected item in this textbox without needing the hidden field and model property In this instance ContactName is the important value to save.p  pstrongRazorstrongp  precode     Html.TextBoxForx gt x.Issue.ContactNameDisplay, new  style  width 100, id  ContactNameDisplay  Html.HiddenForx gt x.Issue.ContactName, new id  ContactName codepre  pstrongAutocompletestrongp  precodeContactNameDisplay.autocomplete                    dataType json,            source function request, response                 .getUrl.ActionLoadAdFullNames, Order,  phrase request.term , function data                     response.mapdata, function item                         return                             label item.Text,                            value item.Value,                                                                        ,            select function event, ui                 event.preventDefault                ContactName.valui.item.val                this.valui.item.val               this.textui.item.label       Breaks Here                .getUrl.ActionLoadPhoneNumber, Order,  windowsId ui.item.value , function data                     ContactPhone.valdata.toString                             ,            focus function event, ui                 event.preventDefault                this.textui.item.label            ,         codepre

Negative 539 pI am developing a webapp for mobile phones. There is one xhtml page, where I want to show a picture, which is stored locally on my hard drive for example Dpicturestest.jpg. Since browsers block images when they are located on a local harddrive, I wrote a method in my javabean, where the picture, stored on the localHD, is copied to the webApp directory, when the user enters the xhtml page. After the user leaves the page, the copied file inside the webapp should be deleted. So when Im running my app, copying works perfectly and the pictures are displayed correctly. However, when the files should get deleted, I get this errormessagep  blockquote   pjava.nio.file.FileSystemException DWebAppPathsrcmainwebappresourcespicstest.jpg    The process cannot be accessed because the file is being used by another process.p blockquote  pStrangely enough, after stopping and restarting the application I can delete the same image if it is still in the webApp directory.

Negative 539 pCurrently theres a sql function that does a bunch of calculations and Im wondering if the following would be a good replacement.  Im thinking of building a C frontend app that calls sql server and pulls the data and dumps it into a datatable.  From there, I will feed the data as a list or vectorrows from sqldataadaptor class to C which will be better for calculations supposedly.  Here are some assumptions.p  p1.Must be done in C, only question is whether to introduce Cp  p2.The Sql function currently does 3 or 4 select statments on the data which have their unique group by up to 10 parameters   p  pSo should I give the data from C to C pregroup or maybe ordered by instead and have C take care of this by building some kind of treemap or dictionary and iterating through the table.  Its easy to execute a sql statment in C and have the data all grouped already but that makes C job somewhat useless and it might be to granularp  p3.the calculations in sql that Im trying to replace are of the following formatp  precode  select a  expsumlogx,      b  expsumlogx,      c  expsumlogy,      d  expsumlogz,      e  expsumlogu   from datatable   group by e,f,g,h,k codepre  pnothing too complicated really, very basic math.   p  pAgain,  Its easy to execute this statement in C and just return grouped elements but that means the sum and log would have been done in C and C rendered useless.  But if I have thousands and possibly tens of thousands of rows in my table per iteration and this is run multiple times a day, will C have any advantage in terms of the math my gut tells me not really.  p  p4.the above calculations correspond to 1 account, there will be hundreds of account and datatable will have thousands if not more rows per account, this will be run maybe every hour 247.p  pThe C rewrite is inevitable but is there really any reason to leverage C for speed.  Its mainly for speed and possibly decoupling for future maintenance but overall speed.  If I use C, would this be the way to go and what data structures would be most appropriate for working with this data and emulating some of its sql functionality.

Negative 539 pI am attempting to do exercise 7.32 from C Primer 5th Edition. That exercise asks the followingp  blockquote   pDefine your own versions of codeScreencode and codeWindowmgrcode in which codeclearcode is a member of codeWindowmgrcode and a friend of codeScreencode.p blockquote  pHere are the definitions for codeScreencode, codeWindowmgrcode and codeclearcode given in the text.p  precodeclass Screen    public     using pos  stdstringsizetype     Screenpos ht, pos wd, char c  heightht, widthwd, contentsht  wd, c     private     pos height  0, width  0     stdstring contents   class Windowmgr    public     using ScreenIndex  stdvectorltScreengtsizetype     void clearScreenIndex   private     stdvectorltScreengt screensScreen24, 80     void WindowmgrclearScreenIndex i    Screen amps  screens[i]   s.contents  stdstrings.height  s.width,    codepre  pNow those two classes, if defined Screen first than Windowmgr work as I expect. Now, the exercise asks me to make codeclearcode a friend of Screen and define codeclearcode. To make codeclearcode a member a friend, if I understand correctly, codeWindowmgrcode must be defined. To define codeWindowmgrcode, codeScreencode must be defined. This seems impossible to me.p  pThe text gives the following hintsp  blockquote   pMaking a member function a friend requires careful structuring of our programs to accommodate interdependencies among the declarations and definitions. In this example, we must order our program as followsp      ul   lipFirst, define the codeWindowmgrcode class, which declares, but does not define, codeclearcode. codeScreencode must be declared before codeclearcode can use members of codeScreencode.pli   lipNext, define class codeScreencode, including a friend declaration for codeclearcode.pli   lipFinally, define codeclearcode, which can now refer to members in codeScreencode.pli   ul blockquote  pThe order in which I attempted to solve this exercise was ultimately thisp  precodeclass Screen  class Windowmgr    public     using ScreenIndex  stdvectorltScreengtsizetype     void clearScreenIndex   private     stdvectorltScreengt screensScreen24, 80     class Screen    friend WindowmgrclearWindowmgrScreenIndex   public     using pos  stdstringsizetype     Screenpos ht, pos wd, char c  heightht, widthwd, contentsht  wd, c     private     pos height  0, width  0     stdstring contents   void WindowmgrclearScreenIndex i    Screen amps  screens[i]   s.contents  stdstrings.height  s.width,    codepre  pThis obviously would not work, due to the vector in codeWindowmgrcode that needs codeScreencode to be a complete type. This seems like an unsolvable exercise, unless the authors do not intend one to use codeScreencode and codeWindowmgrcode classes they present earlier.p  pHas anyone else solved this exercise from C Primer.

Negative 539 pThe context of my problem is in network programming. Say I want to send messages over the network between two programs. For simplicity, lets say messages look like this, and byteorder is not a concern. I want to find a correct, portable, and efficient way to define these messages as C structures. I know of four approaches to this explicit casting, casting through a union, copying, and marshaling.p  precodestruct message      uint16t logicalid     uint16t command  codepre  h2Explicit Castingh2  precodevoid sendmessagestruct message msg      uint8t bytes  uint8t  msg      call to writesendsendto here    void receivemessageuint8t bytes, sizet len      assertlen gt sizeofstruct message     struct message msg  struct message bytes      And now use the message      if msggtcommand  SELFDESTRUCT          ...   codepre  pMy understanding is that codesendmessagecode does not violate aliasing rules, because a bytechar pointer may alias any type. However, the converse is not true, and so codereceivemessagecode violates aliasing rules and thus has undefined behavior.p  h2Casting Through a Unionh2  precodeunion messageu      struct message m     uint8t bytes[sizeofstruct message]   void receivemessageunionuint8t bytes, sizet len      assertlen gt sizeofstruct message     union messageu msgu  bytes      And now use the message      if msgugtm.command  SELFDESTRUCT          ...   codepre  pHowever, this seems to violate the idea that a union only contains one of its members at any given time.

Negative 539 pI have a iPhone application written in Objective C where Im collecting the touch points the user draws on to the screen to create a path.p  pI want to be able to thin this data. One of the ways Im aiming to do this by checking if the angle of a point is over a certain threshold. For instance, if I take any three adjacent points on the line called a,b,c, if the angle ABC is within 5 degrees of 180, then I could remove point b without affecting the line too much.p  pIm trying to achieve this by splitting the triangle ABC into 2 rightangled triangles. Im then using acosf to find the angle at a BAC and the angle at c BCA. I can then subtract both these angles from 180 to find the angle of ABC.p  pMy issue is that acosf is often returning NaN. When it returns a number Ive checked it on a calculator and the value is correct. Ive tried the values that return NaN and they dont work on a calculator either.

The Dr Edit code example has a code.htaccesscode file, but no codeapp.yamlcode file.  And, in the codeREAD MEcode file, the strongvery first stepstrong for setting up the application, is to strongcreate a Google App Engine applicationstrong.

The problem however is that I lose the transactions on the application code, i.e. after each test the transactions are rolled back, but if an exception occurs in the application code the insert is not rolled back and my unit test fails because I expect the table to be empty, but it isnt.p  pHow would I go about achieving these two levels of transaction  Is it possible  I can work around the problem by writing a setup method for my unit tests that clears out all of the tables before each test.  I am fine with this, but I thought it would be good to be able to use the rollback method of achieving the same thing.p

Negative 539 pIve been thrashing around this issue for the past 2 days. I have an xPage view. I click on a linkdoc, it takes me to the document in read mode.

In the codeonClickcode event of the button, I make a line of serversided codep  precodecontext.setDocumentModeedit codepre  pI save the form, go back to the view, click on the doclink, and now the document immediately comes up in edit mode. Its as if opening the doc executes the codeonClickcode event of this button. I want it to wait until I ACTUALLY press the button.p  pIf I remove the button, then the doc comes up in readmode.p  pTo make sure something wasnt whacked, I made a REAL simple database with one form called test. One field in the form, a view called testview, then created 2 documents with the form. Created an xPage called codexTestviewcode using testview and an xPage form called codexTestFormcode with the button and the field. Cant get much simpler than that. Happens exactly the same there too.p

Negative 539 pI got 2 files from my university for writing thesis using LaTeX. One is a .sty file and other one is .TeX file. In order to work in R studio Ive decided to have separate .Rnw files for each chapter and one file for combining all the chapters. I think .TeX file is the one where I can combine all the chapters because it gives sample chapters in output. On R studios website there is a page titled as Working with Multiple Rnw Files which describes this process I guess but is not clear to me. It talks about child files which I think are the chapters in my case. So my simple question is that if I create different .Rnw files, one for each chapter, how can I ask R to combine them in one TeX file which university provided me Please bear my ignorance as I am new to reproducible research stuff.p

Negative 539 pI have a friend who is struggling to learn OO programming in a Computer Science class, mainly, I believe, due to the fact that he does not understand the relativitydifference between type and the actual instance. It appears to be an issue in understanding how data is stored.p  pHe knows variables, and control structures, and quite a few algorithms, but I think understanding scope and the way objects are defined in Java is confusing to him. The most confusing part is the template part, where the methods and variables are defined, but are owned by each object.p  pAs this post kind of shows, Im horrible at explaining this concept, even when I know Im explaining it to people.p  pSo what I want to know, is how can strongclearly explain to him instances and classes as a type, versus the actual data.strong He knows the basic concept, I think,  but does not fully understand the difference between type and data, and how the data is passed around. p  hr  pMore infop  pHeres the sort of confusion he is experiencing. Were working with overriding a Critter object in GridWorld The horribly designed AP test object thing. In any event, we are suppose to redefine some methods.p  pHell end up trying to use methods as properties quite possibly a typo, but also because stuff like GetLocation may be confusing, or hell try to use methods on the wrong variable, or not use the right type of variable. p  pThe difference between Integer nameHere and nameHere Integer is confusing, I think, to him. He may try to do Integer.equals when he should do nameHere.equals. I show him the API, but I think its just plaining confusing.p  pHow do you explain the difference between type and variable, but not only that, but show how a variable can have other variables in it, how when you write p  precodepublic getSomething      return something  codepre  pYou are getting specific data from the class you instantiated, oh, and by the way, its different for every single objectp  pHow can I get him to stop thinking global and start thinking relative How do you explain relativep

Negative 539 pI want my SP 2013 cloud app office 365 to connect to my on premises WCF services. Visual Studio gives templates to create provider hosted apps for this purpose. However, that requires Windows Azure service bus connector that helps the app connect to WCF. Since I have a static IP, I want to get this done without the connector.p  pI attempted this by implementing IRemoteEventService in a new WCF with wsHTTPBinding with security as none. This is running on static IP machine with all connections allowed on the port where this service is listening. I was able to call this service from my test WCF client over the internet.p  pNow in my app, I changed my end point to this WCF service. When app installs it tries to call this end point to deliver the app install event. However, it gives error that end point is not available or there is a soap error.p  pPlease provide pointers on what changes are required in WCF configuration to receive calls from SharePoint. Thanks.p

Negative 539 pI am new to Android DevelopmentJava ProgrammingEclipse so please bear with me. Ive been going through the Android Developer Training developer.android.comtraining and the Hello Android book by Ed Burnette and keep running into a problem that is making it difficult to move forward. Ill do my best to describe it and am hoping that the community can help me resolve it. p  pI began seeing this issue with the Android Developer Training around Adding the Action Bar  Adding Action Buttons and it became impossible to circumvent at Hello Androids 3.3 Creating Opening Screen when I tried adding the Sudoku buttons. The only change I made when going through Hello Android was adding the Android Development Toolkit ADT for Eclipse. I dont recall this being a required download going through the Android Developer Training page so I am wondering if its addition could have contributed to the problem. p  pThe issue that I keep running into is that when I go to build the project, Eclipse keeps telling mep  pactionsettings cannot be resolved or is not a fieldp  pactivitysudoku cannot be resolved or is not a fieldp  pcontainer cannot be resolved or is not a fieldp  pfragmentsudoku cannot be resolved or is not a fieldp  psudoku cannot be resolved or is not a fieldp  pIve tried several fixes that I saw on in the forum including deleting the import.android.R from the sudoku.java file in my src folder but that brings up a bunch of errors that say R cannot be resolved into a variable.  Ive tried cleaning and rebuilding and restarting Eclipse, methods that occasionally worked before Hello Android and the plugin, but keep getting the same errors. Ive also tried setting to Android 3.0 and higher thinking that might be an issue but there was no change. Occasionally I get another error regarding not being able to find the path for a container but Ive been playing around with the IDE for 15 minutes and cant seem to get it to pop up again.p  pI could really use some help on this. p  pHope to hear from you, p  pYusif Nurizadep
Negative 539 pI am using an Arduino Uno microprocessor in conjunction with a bluetooth shield. This is irrelevant. What is important is that I am sending a bluetooth signal form this device. I want to make an app for my phone to immediately turn off, be disabled, or at least have text messaging and calling disabled. Basically, I want to put this device in a car and when my phone gets near, calling and messaging is disabled. I am okay if I need to keep my app running in the background. I cannot find any examples on the web, so any suggestions are deeply appreciated. p

Negative 539 pI have an app which uses a UIWebView and cordovaPhoneGap. One section of the app has a Download Calendar feature, which has been giving me a lot of issues on the native iOS side. The basic function of Download Calendar is an ajax call type POST which returns formatted ics data. In mobile safari, this functions perfectly. A table view will slide up from the bottom and give me the option to add the listed events to my phones calendar. I think this is just how safari normally handles ics files. Now for my issue...p  pUIWebView doesnt seem to want to behave this way. When I tap Download Calendar nothing happens. To get the ics data, I used an NSURLConnection to get the response, and put it in an NSData structure called webData. With webData, Im making this call p  precode[self.webView loadDatawebData               MIMETypetextvcalendar       textEncodingNameutf8                baseURL[NSURL URLWithStringcalshow]] codepre  pIn my codeshouldStartLoadWithRequestcode method, Im telling any calshow urls to open the calendar, but I dont think this gets me anywhere, since I cant pass the NSData along with it. My main question right now is, can my UIWebView mimic how safari handles this ics data If not, can I do anything useful with this NSData p  precodeBEGINVCALENDARrnPRODIDbobbin v0.1NONSGML iCal  WriterENrnVERSION2.0rnCALSCALEGREGORIANrnMETHODPUBLISHrnBEGINVEVENT... codepre  pstrongUPDATEstrong I was able to get this working in a codeUIDocumentInteractionControllercode, where it displays the dates and times exactly how safari would handle the data, however, there isnt an Add All button or an Open in Calendar... option.

However I cant create the record if it already exists and so I check for the existence of the record and remove it if it exists in the beginning of the test.

Negative 539 pGood day. I have a web application where a user fills out several forms. These forms can then be edited and I want to log the edits in my database as well in a form of an audit trail by getting all the dirty fields in the form and logging the codenamecode and codevaluecode in the database.p  pInitially, I had a problem with Radio Buttons that had the same name since they were marked as dirty but I eventually managed to solve that. My issue now, however, are the fields inside a FieldContainer. Even if I unmark them as dirty, when I run the code that checks for dirty fields, the fields inside the FieldContainer are marked as dirty. p  pHeres the code that I run on preloading of the form to make my buttons cleanp  precodeform.items.filterByfunctionc      ifc.getXTyperadiofield         c.originalValue  c.getValue         c.checkDirty          else          ifc.getXTypefieldcontainer         c.items.filterByfunctiond             ifd.getXTypecheckboxfield  d.getXTypetextfield                 d.getXTypecombobox                  console.logitemID of field in fieldContainer    d.getItemId                  d.originalValue  d.getValue                 d.checkDirty                  console.logcomponent dirty state    d.isDirty                              codepre  pWhat my function does is it iterates through every child view element of the form. As you can see, I have two if conditions. My first if condition checks if the element is a radio button, if so, I just mark it as clean. The second if statement checks if the element is a field container. If so, I check all the children view elements in the field container and I look for check boxes, text fields, and combo boxes, then mark them as clean. Heres the console log that I got from thatp  precodeitemID of field in fieldContainer  amountFinanced component dirty state  false itemID of field in fieldContainer  unitTerm component dirty state  false codepre  pI counter checked with my View and those are the right itemIDs and they are marked as clean.p  pNow, I create my audit trail records on button click. The general idea is that I get the active form, go through the fields and check which ones are dirty. Heres my codep  precodeform2.items.filterByfunctionc     ifc.getXTyperadiofield  c.getXType combobox         c.getXTyperadiogroup  c.getXType textfield         c.getXTypedatefield  c.getXType fieldset         c.getXTypefieldcontainer  c.getXType checkbox           ifc.getXTypefieldcontainer             ifc.isDirty                 var entry                   ifc.getXTyperadiofield                     entry  c.getName     c.getSubmitValue                                  else                     entry  c.getName     c.getRawValue                                   changes.pushentry                               else             c.items.filterByfunctiond                 ifd.getXTyperadiofield  d.getXType combobox                     d.getXTyperadiogroup  d.getXType textfield                     d.getXTypedatefield  d.getXType fieldset                     d.getXTypefieldcontainer  d.getXType checkbox                       ifd.getXTypefieldcontainer ampamp d.getXTypelabel                         console.logitem id    d.getItemId                         console.logitem name    d.getName                         console.logcomponent dirty state    d.isDirty                          ifd.isDirty                              var entry                               ifd.getXTyperadiofield                                 entry  d.getName     d.getSubmitValue                                                          else                                 entry  d.getName     d.getRawValue                                                          changes.pushentry                                                                                            codepre  pThis is a bit lengthier than the previous one. I start by going through all the view elements inside the form and I filter through all the element XTypes that I used. If I come across something thats not a field container, I check if its dirty, if its dirty, I take the codenamecode and codevaluecode of the field and put it in an array that I will later on save to my database. However, if its a field container, I check the elements in that field container to check if those are dirty then Ill save them. p  pNow. I also log the item IDs as well as the name of the fields inside the fieldcontainer. I checked if marking the fields inside the fieldset as clean as I did when I loaded the forms would help. However, upon checking the console for logs, I saw that the fields inside the fieldcontainer was marked as dirty even if I didnt change them. Here is my logp  precodeitem id  amountField item id  amountFinanced item name  AMOUNTFINANCED component dirty state  true item id  termField item id  unitTerm  item name  TERM component dirty state  true codepre  pAs you can see, I am able to go through the field container amountField and termField respectively, navigate to the field amountFinanced  textfield, and unitTerm  comboBox, get their names, and see if theyre dirty. p  pNow Im confused, I was able to mark those fields as clean earlier, why is it that when I proceed to checking all the dirty fields, theyre now marked as dirty even if I didnt change anythingp  pIs there a better way to check if the fields inside a field container and a field set are dirty Ive been stuck with this problem for several hours now and the frustration is getting to me.p  pThanks for any help.p

I have this test in two versionsp  pfirstp  precodedef testmailer   MailTestMailer.deliveries.clear   get ownerstest   e   MailTestMailer.deliveries.pop   puts e.to.tos end codepre  psecondp  precodedef testmailer   get ownerstest   MailTestMailer.deliveries.clear   e   MailTestMailer.deliveries.pop   puts e.to.tos end codepre  pIn the second version this test fails with the error message codeNoMethodError undefined method to for nilNilClasscode This makes sense to me. I clear the messages then ask for the last one which should be nil. However when I run the test on the first version the error is codeNameError uninitialized constant OwnersControllerTestMailcode p  pSo somehow the get method is causing the codeMailcode objectmodule to be made available. I dont understand how it can do this. I dont know if this is a racktest or padrino thing so am unsure what extra information to copy in here.p

Firstly, strongApple no longer supports sslstrong, so we changed to TLS instead. p  pSecond thing is and this is a really strange one, that if we invoke strongwebservicestrong on stronglocal computerstrong to send push notification, everything works fine. But, when we publish this code to our strongtesting serverstrong, push notifications are strongnot deliveredstrong to the phone, but the code is exactly the samep  pOne other thing, after codesendToApplecode method is called, we get codeOK status codecode, just notification doesnt come.p  pAny ideasp
Negative 539 pI am working my way through the NeHe demos using Three.js see a hrefhttpwww.johannesraida.detutorials.htm relnofollowhttpwww.johannesraida.detutorials.htma.  I got to 15.  I cloned 14, outline fonts, which works fine.  I built a simple shader to texture the font.  The same shader approach works fine with planar objects.  However, while it SORT OF works, the rendering is very inconsistent. Sometimes the texture is more or less correctly rendered, sometimes not. The stem of the h is correct but the bowl is obviously not.p  pSeeimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comqPjuW.png altenter image description herep  pThe shaders arep  precodeltscript idvertexShader typexshaderxvertexgt         varying vec3        vNormal         varying vec2        vUv                     Multiply each vertex by the modelview matrix and the projection            matrix both provided by Three.js to get a final vertex position                   void main                set the variables passed behind the scenes by three.js to our              varying variables, which makes them available to the other shader             vNormal  normal             vUv  uv              glPosition  projectionMatrix  modelViewMatrix  vec4position,1.0               ltscriptgt      ltscript idfragmentShader typexshaderxfragmentgt          create the shared variables. which are set in the vertex shader         varying vec3        vNormal         varying vec2        vUv         uniform sampler2D   texImage          void mainvoid               glFragColor  texture2DtexImage, vUv              ltscriptgt codepre  pAnd the text geometrymesh setup isp  precodeuniforms                       texImage    type t, value texture                             find the shaders             var vs  document.getElementByIdvertexShader.textContent             var fs  document.getElementByIdfragmentShader.textContent               and create our shader material...             var shaderMaterial  new THREE.ShaderMaterial                     uniforms       uniforms,            pass the uniforms vars                     shading        THREE.FlatShading,                     side           THREE.DoubleSide,    want the texture on both sides                     vertexShader   vs,                  pointers to the shaders                     fragmentShader fs                               var materialFront  shaderMaterial             var materialSide   shaderMaterial             var materialArray  [ materialFront, materialSide ]              textGeom  new THREE.TextGeometry text ,                  size size,                      actually the height of the font, in userspace                 height height,                  THICKNESS of the extruded font, in userspace                 curveSegments curveSegments,                 font font,                      name of the font                 weight weight,                  bold or normal                 style style,                    regular, italic or bold                 bevelThickness bevelThickness,                 bevelSize bevelSize,                 bevelEnabled bevelEnabled,                 material 0,                     index in the array of the face                 extrudeMaterial 1               index in the array of the extruded sides                           var textMaterial  new THREE.MeshFaceMaterialmaterialArray             var textMesh  new THREE.MeshtextGeom, textMaterial  codepre  pThe code is on github at a hrefhttpsgithub.comrkwrightnehethreejs relnofollowhttpsgithub.comrkwrightnehethreejsa.

Negative 539 pI want to understand a simple scenario where there are so many threads competing for a synchronized shared resource. only one thread definitely will acquire a lock on the resource and all other must wait, now on resource availability each waiting thread will again attempt to acquire a lock and if failed then again suspended for next try. Is this scenario not increasing context switch overhead because threads are suspending and resuming again and again to grab the resource. I just want to ask that is there a directly proportional relationship between 1 synchronization overhead and context switch overhead 2 Introducing more shared variables by locks in any algorithm would increase context switch overhead i.e. There is a directly proportional relationship between number of shared resources and context switch overheadp  hr  pAm I rightp  hr  pNow my second question is if nonblocking algorithms are used for synchronization in the above scenario i.e. if Atomic variable is used as a shared resource then what is the effect of context switch overhead in case of Atomic shared resource . Will the competing thread for the shared resource will not suspend or resume i.e. how this phenomena of nonblocking synchronization is handledp

Negative 539 pThe app Im coding will need to take userdefined code the language is not particularly important as the user will never see the language, users will use something like visual scripting and run that code. The code will need to access libraries written in Java, and create variables and so on. The user provided code will be as complicated as a full program.p  pI have been looking around for ways to approach this. So far, Ive found a few different approaches to this in Java, reflection, javax.script, JavaCompiler, write my own interpreter, among other others. From what Ive read reflection probably would not work, according to the android package index, android doesnt have javax.script or JavaCompiler, but there are projects that port Rhino and V8 to android, and I dread writing an interpreter, but will if necessary.p  pWhat I want to know is, am I going in the right direction What would be the best way to approach thisp

But here in the lab we are very used to using C or Fortran plus MPI to develop for running entirely on CPU, and maybe, rarely, someone may need to use the Nvidias node to run something in CUDA.p  pNow, at the start of a new project, I thought it would be very nice to be able to code things in MPI  OpenCL, and be able include in the distributed processing both GPUs and CPUs, running the same OpenCL code. So, is it advisable, is OpenCL implementations ready for such task With OpenCL code running on CPU with Intel SDK, can I count with as good performance as I would have with a multithreaded C program compiled with Intels compiler Can you point to comparisons and benchmarksp

Negative 539 pIm making Coded UI Tests with Visual Studio 20122013 for a WPFapplication of my company. Because the development is still in a flux, i want to create test fragments which are generic with parameters and can be reused. Now i have a special case. I have a mask with a WpfTable looks like a grid on it, which contains  per example  a list of all users. While the test i want to make a DoubleClick on a selected user to open the next mask for editing hisher data. So i want to program a method for my tests which gets the WpfTable, a ColumnIndex and a UserName as parameters for the search. So i have programmed this method for stepping through the rows.p  precodeprivate void SearchRowAndColumnWpfTable table      int n  0     while n lt table.RowCount              var row  new WpfRowtable         row.SearchProperties.AddWpfRow.PropertyNames.RowIndex, n.ToString         UITestControlCollection foundRows  row.FindMatchingControls         if foundRows.Count gt 0                      row  WpfRowfoundRows.ToList[n]             Keyboard.SendKeysrow, Down, ModifierKeys.None             if n  2                              Mouse.DoubleClickrow, new Point10, 10                 n  table.RowCount                               n       codepre  pAs You can see i commented some lines out. These lines were for a simple test to see, if my idea works and it did. But now i have the problem, that many rows of my list are out of sight, because i have 74 users, but only 16 are displayed. When i want to see the other users, i have to scroll down. So  as You can see in my code  i tried to scroll by the Downkey, which works for a little while. Unfortunately foundRows.Count is always at 18 which matches the number of rows in sight  2. So when my index n is at 19 i get an exception because the index is out of range at WpfRowfoundRows.ToList[n]. How can i manage to find my row and cell, even if they are out of the visible rangep  pThanks in advancep

Negative 539 pIn a large game map of a realtime strategy game, the players can select the game unit for example the troops by directly clicking on it or draw a rectangular box to select multiple of them.p  pIt can be implemented quite easily by having a bounding box around each unit, and check for collision between the selection box and their bounding box.p  pHowever, looping through every unit to check for collision for every click from the player sounds very inefficient to me. A game can easily accumulate thousands of clicks and having hundreds of units. That will cause a lot of unnecessary computational checks.p  pstrongQuestion 1strong Is it possible to select the unit without looping through every single object on the map p  pI have looked through those post in SO regarding collision detection, but non talk about exactly how to do it efficiently without using the brute force approach.p  pI have been thinking on this question for quite some time and did numerous online searching for possible solution, but it is just an futile attempt.p  pstrongQuestion 2strong Can I implement it like how JButton in Java works by sending an actionEvent from the unit which being clicked If I do that, do I have to create a single thread for every unit That sounds equally bad though.p

Negative 539 pI am wondering what the optimal order is for a sequence of instructions like the one below on Intel processors between Core 2 and Westmere.

In other words, there are no nonobvious aliases in the instructions above and data has been laid out for aligned access to large blocks of data. All the memory lines being accessed are in the L1 cache.p  pOn the one hand, my understanding of Agner Fogs a hrefhttpwww.agner.orgoptimize relnofollowoptimization guidesa make me believe that it may be possible to get close to two instructions by cycle with an ordering like the one belowp  precodemovdqa  xmm0, 12864rbx movdqa  xmm1, 12880rbx pxor    128rsp, xmm0 movdqa  xmm2, 12896rbx pxor    112rsp, xmm1 movdqa  xmm3, 128112rbx pxor    96rsp, xmm2 movdqa  xmm8, 64rbx pxor    80rsp, xmm3 movdqa  xmm9, 80rbx pxor    128r14, xmm8 movdqa  xmm10, 96rbx pxor    112r14, xmm9 movdqa  xmm11, 112rbx pxor    96r14, xmm10 movdqa  xmm12, 64rdx pxor    80r14, xmm11 movdqa  xmm13, 80rdx pxor    0r14, xmm12 movdqa  xmm14, 96rdx pxor    16r14, xmm13 movdqa  xmm15, 112rdx pxor    32r14, xmm14 pxor    48r14, xmm15  codepre  pThis ordering attempts to take into account cache bank conflicts as described in Agner Fogs microachitecture.pdf by leaving an offset between the reads and the writes.p  pOn the other hand, another concern is that although the programmer knows that there are no aliases in the code above, they have no way to convey this information to the processor. May the interleaving of reads and writes introduce delays because of the processor has to take into account the possibility that a read is of a value that was modified by a write in the above instructions In that case obviously it would be better to do all the reads first, but since this is not possible for that particular sequence of instructions, perhaps getting all the writes done first would make sense.p  pIn short, there seems to be many possibilities here, and my intuition is not good enough to get a feeling of what is likely to happen with each of them.p  pEDIT if that matters, the code that comes before the sequence under consideration has been either loading the codexmmcode registers from memory or computing them with arithmetic instructions, and the code that comes after uses these registers either to write them to memory or as inputs to arithmetic instructions. The memory locations that have been written to are not reused immediately. coderbxcode, coderspcode, coder14code and coderdxcode are longlived registers that have to come from the register file.p

Negative 539 pI need to be able to encrypt and decrypt a message using a Polybius Square, I know how this works on paper but dont know where to start when turing it into a program. I was planning to use a hashmap but I was told thats a bad way to go about it and that theres better approuchs to do this that are easier... like what Ive been given code to help me by my lecture from a workshop on the project but I dont fully understand it. Ill paste it below and if anyone could explain it I would greatly appreciate it Ive been focusing on C alot this past while so now im a bit rusty when it comes to Java.p  pHere a double array Ive made myself for the polybius grid, how do I incorperate ADFGVX into thisp  precodechar [][] poly  new char[][]             p,h,0,q,g,6,             4,m,e,a,1,y,             l,2,n,o,f,d,             x,k,r,3,c,v,             s,5,z,w,7,b,             j,9,u,t,i,8 codepre  pThats a double array that Ill be using to stort the Polybius square rightp  precodeforint row  0 rowltpoly.length,row forint col  0 colltpoly[row].length,col ifpoly[row][col]  MyChar That Im Looking For  codepre  pThis is used for navigating the array and finding the chars I wantp  precode how to break a line down to a character    String[] words  line.split     forint i0 i lt words.length i       String word  words[i]       forint j  0 j ltword.length j         char letter  word.charAtj         encryptletter        codepre  pThis is breaking a line down to letters ovbiously what do I do then also is the method encrypt in the java lib or do I have to make my own somehow Im not sure where to begin or what would be the best way to go about this, I think I might just watch hash map tutorials and try that This is my first time trying encryption and the whole thing looks hard and intimidating.p

Negative 539 pI am new to AspectJ, and we are working on migrating a thirdparty application originally written using Eclipse to use Android Studio 1.1.0 and Gradle instead.  We have taken an external library this app needs and created a library module in the project, and this library has an AspectJ strong.ajstrong file that we need to compile and have work with the main app for a fieldlevel Observable pattern.  Using the plugin found a hrefhttpsgithub.comuPhycagradleandroidaspectjplugin relnofollow titlehereherea, I have been able to get the strong.ajstrong file to compile into a strong.classstrong file, verified by looking in the codeintermediatescode folder.p  pThe problem is coming in the weaving step, where this code is supposed to be injected into the bytecode of the necessary classes.  This does not appear to be happening, as the listeners that are supposed to be notified when a field changes, arent.

Negative 539 pI am creating Model3Ds in memory by reading them from XAML files. Most of these models are very large, so the process occurs in a background thread.

Negative 539 pI am working on exportingimporting a blog using a Rails app. So I have some XML Im working with, and some of it is encoded incorrectly  it says its UTF8, but it doesnt properly encode certain special characters curly quotes, emdashes, et cetera. They arent encoded in any way, theyre just sitting there.p  pThis solution via a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions18307686filereadlinesinvalidbytesequenceinutf8argumenterrorFile.readlines invalid byte sequence in UTF8 ArgumentErrora almost works p  precodefile.encodeUTF8, UTF8, invalid gt replace codepre  pBut it doesnt actually preserve the characters in any way, leading to a lot of broken symbols in the output.p  pSo instead, Ive been opening every file in a text editor and doing a findreplace for the offending symbols e.g. turning  into  codeamplsquocode before I upload the file to my app.p  pBut its tedious and I know there must be a better way. Is there a way to target these invalid characters within a regular expression in ruby Ive tried the regex in a hrefhttpaxonflux.comhandyregexesforsmartquotes relnofollowthis posta, but I just get a codeinvalid multibyte escapecode errorp  pEDIT It turns out, I cant do any regex on this string. I get an codeinvalid byte sequence in UTF8code error whenever I try. I can, however, perform a bunch of normal string methods.p  precodefile.includerss  gt true file.matchrss  gt ArgumentError invalid byte sequence in UTF8 codepre  pSo there may not be a way around this. But Im still crossing my fingers p  pEDIT 2 Thanks to a hrefhttpjalada.co.uk20111207solvinglatin1andutf8errorsforgoodinruby.html relnofollowthis great posta, I think Im a few steps closer  It looks like I need to use the codefallbackcode option on codeStringencodecode, but beforehand, it looks like I might need to force my string to believe it is encoded as something else. p  pIm not totally sure exactly HOW to forceencode the string. Maybe cp1250 a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3224427pythonsanitizeastringforunicodethis questiona suggests so, because the problembytes are x93, x94, et cetera. But that question is dealing with Python so I cant follow the steps exactly.p  pAnd then I would convert it back to UTF, using the fallback option to sub out invalid bytes for valid replacements Ive tried a few different options here and havent found quite the right one yet.p  pIn any case, Im going to remove the regex tag, because it doesnt look like regex can help me here.p  pAlso, sorry for all the edits  but god andor stackoverflow helps those who help themselves, rightp

Negative 539 pIn MSMQ there is a functionality that lets users to peek at a message without actually consuming it. i.e. I peek at the next message in a Queue based on MessageID. If I am not interested in the message I can put the message back into the Queue i.e. unacknowledged are added back to the Queue and the messageID is maintained.p  pSimilar functionality also exists in RabbitMQ. However in RabbitMQ its not done in a clean way. You can simulate peeking messages by taking the message off the queue and then not sending an acknowledgement so RabbitMQ will then add that message back to the queue. However I read that RabbitMQ can reorder the messages and increment message IDs when unacknowledged messages are readded to the queue. p  pHas anyone encountered this problem before.p  pAlso does any one know if IBM MQ supports this behaviourfunctionality of peek and seekp  pregards Dp

Negative 539 pI have developed a code that composed of two files An envelop bash file, which does a few things and writes to a logfile, and then at some point runs into a for loop in which within it it executes one job at a time using bsub. And an internal bash file, which gets as input the name of the logfile in addition to other input values that necessary for its execution, and executes process X using the input values it received from the envelop file.  Once process X is finished, the internal script writes to the logfile that process X with its specific serial number has been completed. p  pSince the forloop of the envelop file loops 10 times, there are at least 10 parallel processes that being executed and run in parallel, and they all being executed with bsub given the SAME logfile name. The idea is that they would all report to the same logfile once they completed their execution of Process X.  p  pThe general procedure works well, and in each case process X is being executed, and the logfile accumulates as required all the notifications regarding the completion of process X. However, in some incidences we see that the writing to the logfile get disturbed and output lines of two parallel runs are running into each other.br I would like to lock the logfile in such manner that would allow it to receive text only from one parallel run at a time. The idea is to avoid cases where the text becomes mixed due to two processes that write by chance to the logfile exactly at the same time. p  pHere is the part of my envelop file which call to the bsub I reduced the content to the minimum necessaryp  precodefor i1iltbatchesnumber i do    bsub J SerialName q normal bash FetchFasta.bash genomefa SerialFileName.bed logfile done codepre  pHere is the part of my internal file that echo to the logfilep  precode  echo  echo  echo n Completed running  bedtools version echo bedtools getfasta s fi genomefasta bed mySerialFile fo mySerialFile..fa  echo Runs completion time is timedate echo e n  gtgt logfile codepre  pI would appreciate any useful solution   p

Negative 539 pI am really stuck here with a seemingly trivial problem in Go I have a Golang microservice, which outputs data in json format. Lets say I have a simple struct with json tags for this resultp  precodetype Result struct      Name string jsonname     Age int jsonage  codepre  pIn the code part where the data is actually pulled out of the database, I have a quite similar struct, like thisp  precodetype ResultBackend struct      Name string bsonfullName     Age int bsonage  codepre  pThe struct fields are similar, except the different tags. I would like to keep things simple, and return just one struct from the backend service ResultBackend, which can then be send as a JSON response, like thisp  precodefunc process Result      var result ResultBackend     ... do a MongoDB query here and store results in result variable ...     return result  codepre  pThis certainly would not work, because we have two different structs here.  Of course one solution would be to embed both tags in one struct like sop  precodetype Result struct      Name string jsonname bsonfullName     Age int jsonage bsonage  codepre  pand then use this struct in the main code and the process function.  This works, but this seems like poisoning the Result struct of the main code with the bson tags. What, for instance, if the backend result is a XML file Id have to add xml tags to the struct as well. Or maybe someday tags some very obsure database adapter.  This doesnt seem to be the cleanest approach in my eyes. Id rather have a clean Result struct in the main code, and simply to a conversion from one struct to another. p  pIs there any easy way doing that, or do I really have to copy all the fields of a ResultBackend struct to a new Result struct and return that Or I am trying to oversimplify my code here p  pCheers p

Negative 539 pMy implementation executes 3 OpenCL kernels p  pKernelA, KernelB and KernelCp  pThey all operate on the same data and kernel C depends on the Data, produced by A and B. p  pFor evalutation, I executed A and B first, and then Kernel C multiple times on the same input data. p  pWhat I noticed  When I execute C repeadedly, it is very fast.  It is like 3 times faster on the same data. 15ms vs 45 ms p  pIt is very interesting, as I cant explain this behaviour.  There are no RAMGPU memory transfers or anything. Only global, constant and private memory are used. The data is very big Global workgroup size is 640x480 and local workgroup size is 32x2 best result of brute force evaluation.p  pMy GPUs are a Nvidia Quadro NVS 4200 and a Qualcom Adreno 430.p  pI cant explain this because of data caching, since the there is such a huge amount of workgroups executed on differen data. I also execute clflush after each computation. So why is there such a huge performance differencep
Negative 539 pI have a list of Python dictionaries retrieved MongoDB documents that are heterogeneous in structure. This heterogeneity is by no means straightforward, either. All dicts will contain a certain subset of keys. Some dicts will have keys that others do not have. Two dicts may have the same keys, but the structure underneath those keys may differ. The value of one key for two dicts may be a list in each, but the lengths of the list may differ. I need to essentially flatten all of the dicts and write them to a CSV file. Here is a list of two very heavily abridged example dictsp  precode[        answers        age 25.0,       emotionindices [34.0951, 16.8922, 19.3003],       hearingimpairments False,       musicstyles [         rock,         pop,         classical,       ],       ratings          activity [4.0, 3.0, 1.0],         positivity [5.0, 4.0, 3.0],       ,     ,     timestamps        media [         datetime.datetime2012, 3, 29, 11, 18, 26,         datetime.datetime2012, 3, 29, 11, 21, 51,         datetime.datetime2012, 3, 29, 11, 24, 13       ],     ,   ,        answers        age 16.0,       emotionindices None,       hearingimpairments False,       musicstyles [         rock,          pop,        ],       ratings          activity [2.0, 4.0, 2.0, 2.0],         likedislike [1.0, 4.0, 2.0, 1.0],         positivity [1.0, 4.0, 1.0, 2.0],       ,     ,     timestamps        media [         datetime.datetime2010, 7, 13, 19, 9, 50,         datetime.datetime2010, 7, 13, 19, 13, 26,         datetime.datetime2010, 7, 13, 19, 16, 2,         datetime.datetime2010, 7, 13, 19, 18, 1],       test datetime.datetime2010, 7, 13, 19, 8, 36     ,    ] codepre  pThere are solutions for flattening these, but I also see big gotchas. For instance, the first dict has a list for codeanswers.emotionindicescode, but the second has codeNonecode. A typical flattening scheme would represent the first with flattened keys like codeanswers.emotionindices.0code, codeanswers.emotionindices.1code, etc., and the first with simply codeanswers.emotionindicescode. The fact that the dicts that emdoem have codeemotionindicescode lists may have lists of varying sizes further complicates things. My data nerd friends for whom I have a deep respect would much rather see this and similar instances all represented with as many codeanswers.emotionindices.code as the longest list amongst all records for this field, and those that have either shorter lists or no lists simply show codeNAcode or similar.p  pSo, my first question is, strongis there a generic, flexible way to flatten all of these dictsstrong Or, will the process simply be full of finding all of these inconsistencies and handling them individuallyp  pMy second problem has to do with writing all of these flattened dicts to a CSV file. The codecsv.DictWritercode class handles emmissingem values for keys very flexibly. However, as far as I can tell, it does not handle emaddingem keys on the fly that were not originally specified when instantiating the codeDictWritercodep  pSo, my second question is, strongam I wrong on this, or am I stuck iterating over all of the flattened dicts first to gather keys, making the codeDictWritercode, and then iterating over all of the dicts again to write them Or, is there a better way to do this that Im not seeingstrongp  pNote that because of the amount of data Im juggling here, its very likely that I wont be able to do this in memoryIll have to retrieve the MongoDB documents, flatten the dicts, persist them to files, iterate over the files to gather keys, and then iterate over the files again after my codeDictWritercode has been setupp  pThanks for your timep

Negative 539 pEclipse CDT offers autocompletion of your header files when you write new codeinclude somethingcode statements.p  pIn our project, we use codeI.code and require all includes to state full paths from the project base folder.

My question now is, whether one can change some options to make Eclipses autocompletion for includes work from the project base instead of only relative to the filep

Negative 539 pstrongYes, this is homework. Im just trying to understand why this doesnt seem to work.strongp  pIm trying to find the longest substring in a string thats in alphabetical order. I make a list of random letters, and say the length is 19. When I run my code, it prints out indices 0 through 17.

I have a base class called codeSectionTitleLabelcodep  precodeimplementation SectionTitleLabel   voidinitialize      [[self appearance] setTextColor[UIColor whiteColor]]     [[self appearance] setFont[UIFont fontWithNamekFontBold size16.0f]]   end codepre  pI have created a custom class which inherits from the above base class and have a method called addAttributes.p  precodeinterface PLSLabel  SectionTitleLabel   voidaddAttributesNSArray words codepre  pAnd in the implementation I have the following codep  precode void addAttributesNSArray words      self.words  words      [self setTextColor[UIColor whiteColor]]   When this line is taken out the attributed text is not applied.      for NSString word in self.words           NSMutableAttributedString attributedText  [[NSMutableAttributedString alloc] initWithAttributedStringself.attributedText]         NSRange range  [self.text rangeOfStringlink]         NSLogTEST TEST , link          [attributedText addAttributesNSForegroundColorAttributeName  [UIColor blueColor] rangeNSMakeRangerange.location, range.length]         self.attributedText  attributedText       codepre  pIf I take out the following line from the addAttributes method  code[self setTextColor[UIColor whiteColor]]code then it doesnt work. As in the text remains completely white.p  pHowever when I have that line in the code then it works as expected i.e The words passed into the method become blue. I am hoping that someone can explain why this might be the case. And if its a bug then its good for other people to know a work around.p  pMany thanks.p

Negative 539 pThe doubt is with xpath in the given scenariobr I have this two dropdown item inside a customized dropdown component, this component has a textbox to search items that contains the informed text. Using XPath expression, I want to get the dropdownitem that exact match the informed text which I put at the textbox and not returns the dropdownitem that contains a text before the span tag. This span surround the item that match the informed criteria.p  pTo be clearer, lets look at the html code itself where we have this issuep  pThis first dropdownitem, contains the item that I want to return. The span that contains text codeSteakcode and doesnt contains any above text, inside the div. p  precodeltdiv iddropdownitem roleoptiongt ltspan classselect2matchgtSteakltspangt   Delicious Salmon Steak ltdivgt codepre    pThis second item, contains the item that the xpath expression should ignore, because it contains a text above the span node, inside the dropdownitem div. p  precodeltdiv iddropdownitem roleoptiongt Double ltspan classselect2matchgtSteakltspangt   Monster Fillet Steak ltdivgt codepre    pI tried a lot of XPath expressions and Im starting to think that only with XPath I wont be able to select the item I want. I know that if I concatenate two or more XPaths in programming C or Java, for example and give a substring by the hyphen and in the end find the index that I need, Ill be able to find the required node, but with the amount of information Ill be working, it can not be performatic. The idea would be to use only xpath, perhaps with regex... Any suggestionp

So in this way only one picture would be saved. p  pstrongWhat I have done so farstrong well there is no need to show some code as I am taking suggestion but I am sharing some part of relevant coding which is showing how I am fetching picture from the gallery after taking picture through camera. p  precodeOverride protected void onActivityResultint requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data      super.onActivityResultrequestCode, resultCode, data      if resultCode  RESULTOK           switch requestCode               case REQUESTCODEHIGHQUALITYIMAGE                   if Build.VERSION.SDKINT gt Build.VERSIONCODES.KITKAT                      Intent mediaScanIntent  new Intent                             Intent.ACTIONMEDIASCANNERSCANFILE                     Uri contentUri  Uri.fromFileoutput out is your output file                     mediaScanIntent.setDatacontentUri                     this.sendBroadcastmediaScanIntent                       sendBroadcastnew IntentIntent.ACTIONMEDIASCANNERSCANFILE, mHighQualityImageUri                      refreshing gallery                     Intent mediaScanIntentKitKat  new IntentIntent.ACTIONMEDIASCANNERSCANFILE                     mediaScanIntentKitKat.setDataUri.fromFileoutput                     sendBroadcastmediaScanIntentKitKat                      Intent intentActivityKitKat  new IntentMyCameraActivity.this, PhotoEdititngActivity.class                     intentActivityKitKat.putExtradata, Uri.fromFileoutput                      startActivityintentActivityKitKat                  else                      sendBroadcastnew Intent                             Intent.ACTIONMEDIAMOUNTED,                             Uri.parsefile                                      Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory                      refreshing gallery                     Intent mediaScanIntent  new IntentIntent.ACTIONMEDIASCANNERSCANFILE                     mediaScanIntent.setDataUri.fromFileoutput                     sendBroadcastmediaScanIntent                      Intent intentActivity  new IntentMyCameraActivity.this, PhotoEditingActivity.class                     intentActivity.putExtradata, Uri.fromFileoutput                     Log.vUri before Sending, Uri.fromFileoutput                       startActivityintentActivity                                    break codepre  pso this is how I am loading picture and then taking it to the other activity. p  pstrong What I want strongp  blockquote   pI want to know How can I cure my picture to be saved two times , one   by the camera and other after editing   Please share me some ideas   and show me some code if you have done this before p blockquote

Negative 539 pWhen I try and create an HTML email signature and choosing it as my signature in Outlook the resulting display is horrendous. It literally ignores all the inline styles I specify on my text eg, fontsize13px and appears to enlarge things by about 66. Even when I use the signature editor, my images end up enlarged. All the content lives inside a table layout.p  pIve tried many fixes from around the web, including opening the HTML in a browser and selecting all, then copying and pasting into the editor window. Even when I insert the image via the editor, it still comes out at that bigger size on the receivers end. Ive tried adding additional headers too.p  pId appreciate any input to help me solve this. The signature works fine in Thunderbird.p
