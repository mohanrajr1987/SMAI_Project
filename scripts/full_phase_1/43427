Positive 43427 pI am pretty new to Scrapy. I am looking into using it to crawl an entire website for links, in which I would output the items into multiple JSON files. So I could then upload them to Amazon Cloud Search for indexing. Is it possible to split the items into multiple files instead of having just one giant file in the end From what Ive read, the Item Exporters can only output to one file per spider. But I am only using one CrawlSpider for this task. It would be nice if I could set a limit to the number of items included in each file, like 500 or 1000. p  pHere is the code I have set up so far based off the Dmoz.org used in the tutorialp  pdmozspider.pyp  precodeimport scrapy  from scrapy.spiders import CrawlSpider, Rule from scrapy.linkextractors import LinkExtractor from tutorial.items import DmozItem  class DmozSpiderCrawlSpider     name  dmoz     alloweddomains  [dmoz.org]     starturls  [         httpwww.dmoz.org,     ]      rules  [RuleLinkExtractor, callbackparseitem, followTrue]      def parseitemself, response        for sel in response.xpathulli             item  DmozItem             item[title]  sel.xpathatext.extract             item[link]  sel.xpathahref.extract             item[desc]  sel.xpathtext.extract             yield item codepre  pitems.pyp  precodeimport scrapy  class DmozItemscrapy.Item     title  scrapy.Field     link  scrapy.Field     desc  scrapy.Field codepre  pThanks for the help.p

Negative 43427 pIm wondering, how expensive it is to have many threads in waiting state in java 1.6 x64.p  pTo be more specific, Im writing application which runs across many computers and sendsreceives data from one to another. I feel more comfortable to have separate thread for each connected machine and task, like 1 sending data, 2 receiving data, 3 reestablishing connection when it is dropped. So, given that there are N nodes in cluster, each machine is going to have 3 threads for each of N1 neighbours. Typically there will be 12 machines, which comes to 33 communication threads.p  pMost of those threads will be sleeping most of the time, so for optimization purposes I could reduce number of threads and give more job to each of them. Like, for example. reestablishing connection is responsibility of receiving thread. Or sending to all connected machines is done by single thread.p  pSo is there any significant perfomance impact on having many sleeping threadsp

Negative 43427 pI am trying to make a decision whether I should use a REST service or a SOAP service for some web facing functions that I am producing. This decision is based on whether I can easily use the REST service in implementation. I would prefer to use REST, though I dont want to spend days coding the object model in PHP.p  pThe services are being developed in .NET but will be consumed mainly by PHP.p  pBasically it has come down to one point Ease of integration. Using SOAP in PHP I can use the NuSOAP library, which will generate the object model.p  pHowever with REST I cannot seem to find a way to easily generate that model, if this is possible I would use REST services as they are easier to document and extend, and also have the JSON abilities as well.p  pCan I generate an object model in PHP from an XML fileschema that I could then serialize with the REST servicep

You store a value in the Value table, which is associated with an Attribute the name of the information and an Entity.p  pIn the EAV model, you dont store NULL values.

Negative 43427 pI am building a rating system, and i want to insert a new row, if the codenamecode field strongdoes notstrong already contain the codenamecode i want to insert, and if it does exist, i want to increase the codecountcode field by 1p  pFor example, if i have a row the the codenamecode Tom and i try to insert another row with the codenamecode Tom, then i want to code1code for the field codecountcode on the row that already exists.p  pIf a row with the codenamecode Tom does not exist, i want to insert a new one and set codecountcode to 1.p  pI know i could do this with about 3 SQL statements and some codeifcode statements, but that would slow down the script as 23 sql commands are being executed.p  pAny ideas Thanksp

Negative 43427 pI seem to have coded myself into a corner. First let me tell you what my end goal is I have a GWT app that will have features available to users who are not logged in, and other features only available to authenticated users. When an unauthenticated user clicks on something that requires authentication, I would like a login box to pop up in a modal window, and ask the user to authenticate. if this is unclear go to digg.com and try to digg a story without being logged in, youll see what I mean p  pI have code to add a user and save their username and password hashed with a hrefhttpwww.mindrot.orgprojectsjBCrypt relnofollowjBCrypta. I also have an RPC that accepts a username and password and can validate if the password is correct.p  pMy problem is validating the session. I can get the JSESSIONID, but thats the part where I get lost. How do I associate the users ID with that session, and how do I check that its still validp  pI know glassfish can manage the session, users amp roles for me, but I dont know how to make that work smoothly with GWT.  Are there any examples with GWT and authenticating users in a Java EE environment Ive been googling for hours and Ive come up with nothing.p

Negative 43427 pIn Unix Network Programming there is an example of a Preforked server which uses message passing on a Unix Domain Pipe to instruct child processes to handle an incoming connectionp  precodefor          rset  masterset     if navail lt 0         FDCLRlistenfd, amprset     turn off if no available children      nsel  Selectmaxfd  1, amprset, NULL, NULL, NULL           4check for new connections      if FDISSETlistenfd, amprset          clilen  addrlen         connfd  Acceptlistenfd, cliaddr, ampclilen          for i  0 i lt nchildren i             if cptr[i].childstatus  0                 break               available           if i  nchildren             errquitno available children         cptr[i].childstatus  1    mark child as busy          cptr[i].childcount         navail          n  Writefdcptr[i].childpipefd, , 1, connfd         Closeconnfd         if nsel  0             continue    all done with select results   codepre  pAs you can see, the parent writes the file descriptor number for the socket to the pipe, and then calls close on the file descriptor.  When the preforked children finish with the socket they also call close on the descriptor.  The thing which is throwing me for a loop is that because these children are preforked I would assume that only file descriptors which existed at the time the children were forked would be shared.  However, if that was true, then this example would fail spectacularly, yet it works.p  pCan someone shed some light on how it is that file descriptors created by the parent strongafter the forkstrong end up being shared with the children processp

Negative 43427 pGot a simple WCF demo app that has two console projectshost and client.  Both are running on my machine win 7 box.  Im using the netTcpBinding, which uses windows authentication.  p  pstrongThe issue is that authentication is downgrading to NTLM from kerberos, and I cant figure out why.strongp  pIf I use       p  precodeltclientCredentialsgt    ltwindows allowNtlmtrue gt ltclientCredentialsgt codepre  pon the client side, everything is cool.  But if I change that to codefalsecode, I get the following exceptionp  blockquote   pSecurityNegotiationException  The   remote server did not satisfy the   mutual authentication requirement.p blockquote  pThis suggests that kerberos is failing and since the client wont allow NTLM the call results in an exception being thrown.p  pIs this an issue with the project, or is it an external issue caused by the configuration of my development machine  p  hr  pSolutionp  pApparently, I have to specify the identity of the server within the client configuration.

Okay, now on the client side I fully trust the server hey, I know that guy.

Negative 43427 pThose of us whove worked in VBVB.NET have seen code similar to this abominationp  precodeDim name As String  IIfobj Is Nothing, , obj.Name codepre  pI say abomination for three simple reasonsp  ol licodeIIfcode is a strongfunctionstrong, all of whose parameters are evaluated hence if codeobjcode is nothing in the above call then a codeNullReferenceExceptioncode will be thrown. This is unexpected behavior for someone whos accustomed to shortcircuited ternary operators in languages like C.li listrongBecausestrong codeIIfcode is a function, it thus incurs the overhead of a function call. Again, though this isnt a big deal, it just doesnt feel right to someone who expects for it to behave as a ternary operation intrinsic to the language.li lipcodeIIfcode is nongeneric and therefore accepts parameters of type codeObjectcode, which means the following call boxes I believe a total of three integersp  pcode boxes 2nd and 3rd arguments as well as return value codebr codeDim value As Integer  IIfcondition, 1, 1codepli ol  pNow, in some more recent version of VB.NET Im not sure what the number is, the codeIfcode operator was introduced, which works exactly the same way as the codeIIfcode function but as I understand it without the same shortcomings. That is to say, it strongdoesstrong provide shortcircuiting and it strongisstrong an intrinstic VB operation. However, Im not sure about the last part. The a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarybb513985.aspxMSDN documentationa doesnt seem to indicate whether codeIfcode boxes its arguments or not. Does anyone knowp

Drivers for the vendor specific printers would be available on PC which is ultimately  communicating with printer but my device is facilitating this communication and needs to perform the basic handshakingsetup of the printer i.e, it needs to know when the printer is connected, what are the socket IDs that needs to be opened for CTRL and DATA transmissions etc. All of these printers are supposed to comply with IEEE 1284.4 standards but I see that many of them vary quiet a bit.p  pOne approach I have is to take the USB traces of handshaking from each of these printers and write various sections of code respectively I know, that sounds ridiculous. Is there a generic way to do this Is there any available forum where these standard informations are mentioned For eg EPSON uses EPSONCTRL and EPSONDATA for its control and data services which needs to be provided to get the socket ID for these services. I am pretty sure HPs, Canons etc would have their own service names as well. As per the standards, this was supposed to be captured in IANA but I dont see anything there. Any help on this would be greatly appreciated. p  pThanks and regards, Ullasp

Negative 43427 pIm using a DGV in winforms application. I wanted to change a row status from New IsNewRow to edited.

Negative 43427 pI have a large codedatasetcode with possibly over a million entries. All items have an assigned time stamp and items are added to the set at runtime usually, but not always, with a newer time stamp. I need to show a sub set of this data given a certain time range.

This time range moves at a constant pace, e.g. every second the time range is moved by one second.  Additionally, the user may adjust the time range at any time move through the data set or set additional filters e.g. filter by some text.p  pSo far I wasnt worried about performance, trying to get the other things right, and only worked with smaller test sets.

Negative 43427 pScenario I have many clients web pages, via Socket.io that connect to a Node.js server call it A. The server acts as an application proxy to another service Node.js too for those clients, lets call the service B. In practice, pages talk to service B using the proxy.  Im trying to understand if I could take ONE only open socket from the server A to the service B, just to gain performance and resources on the first client connection on server A, the server will open the socket to B and maintain it open for message to flow bidirectionally. Of course the problem is that without some kind of intervention, messages could be scrambled one over the other, resulting in a mess that service B cant understand. Im quite a newbie in socket programming, and Im wondering if this is yet a solved problem, or just the wrong answer to the problem  Thank youp

Negative 43427 pstrongUpdatestrongp  pemEhh  Even though this question isnt answered, Ive just emptied my pockets and purchased an SSD.  My ramdisk software was going to cost just about as much anyway.  Im not particularly interested in an answer here anymore, so Ill just mark this as answered and go on with my life.em  p  pemThanks for the help.emp  hr  pIve got a program which is writing files to a ramdisk in Windows XP and I need to copy its data from the ramdisk to a directory on my harddrive once it has finished execution.  Obviously in a ramdisk the space is limited and I need to free up as much space on the ramdisk as I can between runs.  The simple solution is to copy the data folder that my program generates on the ramdisk to a location on the harddisk and recursively delete the data folder from the ramdisk.p  pThere is a problem with that solution however my program looks at the filesystem and filenames to ensure that it doesnt overwrite files The most recent data file in the directory is 006.dat, so it will write 007.dat instead of overwriting anything.  I cant just delete the files once Im done writing data because it needs that filesystem intact to record data without overwriting the old files when I copy the data back to my harddrivep  pId like a simple little windows batch script which I can execute after my program has finished writing data files to the ramdisk.  This batch script should copy the ramdisk data folder to my harddisk and delete all the files from the ramdisk, then it should recreate the filesystem as it was but with all zerobyte files.  p  pHow would I go about thisp

The way its displaying on OSX is how I want it to display with a tiny part of the bottom hidden behind the lower element.p  pIf I change the CSS add padding or lineheight it fixes it for Windows but screws it up for OSX.p  pIs there a workaround that doesnt involve having to put OS and Browser specific selectors in the page via javascript or something Im trying to keep the code as pure as possible ie the least hacky fixes possible.p  pCSS for Header and H1p  precodeheader      height70px     overflowhidden     backgroundimage urlheadercanvas2bg.png     backgroundrepeat repeatx     backgroundattachment fixed   header h1      fontsize 100px     fontfamilyJosefin Sans     textalign left     colorffffff  codepre  pHTML for headerp  precodeltheadgt     ltlink hrefhttpfonts.googleapis.comcssfamilyJosefinSans700 relstylesheet typetextcssgt     ltSNIPgt ltheadgt ltbodygt ltdiv idheadergt   lth1gtlta hrefgttesting fontltagtlth1gt ltdivgt ltSNIPgt ltbodygt codepre  pChrome on OSX displaysp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comDmaw7.png altenter image description herep  pChrome on Win 7 displaysp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comseeQc.png altenter image description herep  pstrongEDIT Example herestrong [Live example removed  question answered]p
Negative 43427 pI have a database no more than say 100k which Id like to use as reference documentation for my software. Its just a simple table really  around 5 columns by a couple of hundred rows.

Negative 43427 pIm trying to strip everything except for ajax functionality from jQuery. Sorry for the silly question, but hear me outp  ul liIm using web workers to make the ajax call so I cant have the core.js stuff in there.li liAnother library Im using calls jQuery and I havent been able to get it to work with the jQuery.Hive.Pollen library. After many hours of troubleshooting it seems like this ChemDoodle Web Components library only works with jQuery and Im not experienced enough to know why.li liSeems like a pretty easy thing to do to use the makefile to build jQuery, but Im not sure what to include. In the makefile, I took out everything except the ajaxrelated stuffli ul  p.p  precodeBASEFILES  SRCDIRajax.js     SRCDIRajaxjsonp.js     SRCDIRajaxscript.js     SRCDIRajaxxhr.js codepre  pHowever, further inspection of the ajax source files shows methods that call document. So that means that this wont work at all no matter how many modules I strip rightp  pUpdate Bug issue 9889 on jQuery seems to indicate that core will never provide an ajax function usable by web workers, at least not anytime soon.p  pA bit of a description of what I am trying to do and why I need to use web workers, for anybody interested. Im putting a distributed computing application that does some molecular simulationscreening from a database of compounds. Normal javascript wont work because it will slow down the page and I want the application to continuously run in the browser, computing one molecule after another. Heres a pseudocode outline of my desired web workerp  precodewhile truemain  main  get job from server via ajax  process datamust use web worker send results to server via ajax  codepre  pYes, I could implement my program to unserialize a data string passed from the main page and get the page to fetch the ajax data, like sop  precodepageside javascript var slave  new Worker slave.onMessageevent if status  ready  check if data is available if so, send it to server via ajax fetch job data from server via ajax slave.postMessagejob data    worker slave self.onmessagedata  process results send back to page  codepre  pI guess this could work but its a little tacky and probably is slower than just having the worker do everything. According to Rick Waldron, if you had a system that was empollingem eg. open a worker, make xhr requests in a loop forever, on each response, postMessage the results back to the client, then you can benefitp  pI guess I am making xhr requests in a loop forever so this application would be beneficial.p  pI did find jQuery.Hive.pollen.js, but it is not working with my other library that makes the ajax call I need. Its a separate question though actually my main question, so if anybody is interested here is a link to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7327894chemdoodleajaxincompatibilitywithpollenjsthat posta p

Negative 43427 pI have a python script which reads in a data file and displays one figure with four plots using the matplotlib library.

Negative 43427 pMy question here is pretty simple I want to know if processors try to help exception handling somehow. Would it be possible to completely remove overhead from exception handling and throwing if enough effort is put in designing a processor exceptionreadyp  pBecause as far as I know, all exception handling is done via software, and that always adds some overhead. Am I wrongp  p editp  pSo, thanks for all the answers below. I appreciate. You have answered my question.p  pBut just to clarify why I asked this generally, people dont go too deep into optimizing exceptions because they all think exceptions are for exceptional circumstances, and therefore they are no bottleneck.p  pI dont think exceptions should only be thrown under dramatic circumstances. What I think is, basically, that an exception should be thrown anytime a function cannot comply to what it promised to do.p  pIf I sayp  precodedoSomethingImportant codepre  pAnd if for emwhateverem reason something important cant be done, this should throw an exception.p  pOf course, doSomethingImportant might not be able to comply because the system ran out of memory a dramatic problem, but I think we should be able to model simpler I cant do that nowthis time, sorry into our software, embedded into our designs. Id like to say that I think exceptions can be exceptional, yes, but they emare to be expectedem like normal software flow, not as a fatal error from which the system has to recover, nomsainp  pAnd while big applications backed by nice data centers will hardly ever bottleneck because of exception handling, please dont forget theres market for embedded devices where resources are counted, and exception handling emdoesem have an impact which is what Im aiming for.p  pI personally find exceptions quite expressive, and Id like to use them in embedded devices with as much overhead as I would get by returning 1 and checking that with an if.p

Negative 43427 pI often find myself taking a lot of time to navigate through my filesystem when using the linux shell. This generally occurs because the autocompletion of bash only works if you provide the start of the filedirname. What I often end up in is a lot of ls with grep commands, finally doing a cd.p  pWhen you use a GUI based filebrowser like Nautilus you can type any part of a filedirname and it will have matches that it jumps to directly. This makes it a lot easier and faster to navigate.p  pI wonder if anybody knows any great tools that helps with this problem. I know of the existence of Midnight Commander, though I never really used it for real and I couldnt figure out a direct solution for my problem the first couple of times I tried it. Also it seems not suitable because I want to have my shells current working directory to be changed so I can do stuff there, instead of being stuck in an external program like Midnight Commander.p

Negative 43427 pIm new to Sencha Touch and MVC mostly for that matter, we have a UI team member using the Sencha Designer 2 to create the interface, but at the moment hes create a lot of different models one model for each store. But there is only the one AJAX file that it is referencing, just with different parameters.p  pSo is it possible to make the parameters dynamic depending on which store is trying to access it. Ie, if store User is trying to access the model can it put in ajax.phpstoreuser, if store Facebook is trying to access the model it can put in ajax.phpstorefacebook, so on and so forth. It just seems silly to me to have one model per store, very redundant. p  pIf this is an obvious fix, i am sorry, like i said im new to Sench Touch p

According to all of the documentation Ive been able to muster sched.h, google, SO, SE, my understanding is that one should try and retrieve the process priority of the current process and assign priority based on that. This is fine, except when retrieving the minmax values for codeSCHEDOTHERcode. Since scheduling is system dependent, if I get the priority of the current process as codeSCHEDOTHERcode and try to get the minmax values on a Ubuntu or other linux systems Ive come across, my values would be 00, which wont work for trying to set a valid priority range. However, I do get valid values for codeSCHEDOTHERcode on other unixlike systems OpenBSD, etc.p  pSince my main concern is only trying to get a valid range of priorities values to ensure the user doesnt input too high or low a value, should I not even bother with the current process priority and only get the minmax values for codeSCHEDFFcode or codeSCHEDRRcode since those values seem to give me valid ranges for the various linuxunix systems Ive encountered, or am I missing the point completelyp  pThanks in advance and please let me know if Im unclear or misstating something.p  pbEDIT 1b please note that my main concern is with a portable way to get valid ranges more than the process priority itself..thanksp

Negative 43427 pI am implementing a VOIP application in which I work with SIP protocol. As per SIP I need to refresh my registration with SIP server at certain interval. But when my app goes in background, my keepalive handler is invoked only after 600 seconds as per documents os Apple. But this is not desired with SIP protocol. To be able to keep my connection alive with server and receive incoming call, I need to send registration message before 600 seconds even when app is in background. According to Apple documentation this is not possible but stilll I have seen apps on AppStore which runs in background and keeps their registration on with SIP server even when registration interval is 60 seconds. They keep app running in background throughout. So how is this possible I know that playing silent audio in background will survive but then AppReview process will reject it. But if its so, how Apple allowed other such apps on AppStore Is there some standard way to achieve what I have described above Any help is appreciated.p

Negative 43427 pI searched and read thru the Diamond and virtualinheritance questions here, but could not find an answer. My thinking is that this situation is a little unusual, and I am willing to entertain the ideas that my requirements are somewhat off. On the other hand, I think this should be doable in a nice way.p  pThe situation and the requirementsp  pI have a C class library over which I have no control, and which I cannot change. It defines a codeWindowcode class. The codeWindowcode class has a protected member say codehandlecode, not otherwise accessible, that derived classes are meant to use. codeWindowcode defines hundreds well, a very large number... of methods which I dont care to reimplement by delegating in a decorator, say.p  pI want to add functionality to codeWindowcode, so that derived classes which I write say codeLogWindowcode automatically have. An example of such functionality is the ability to snap windows to each other. In order to implement this I need access to codeWindowcodes protected codehandlecode member.p  pFor my reallife purpose this is enough, and the solution is simple derive codeSnappableWindowcode from codeWindowcode, and derive all my codeWindowcodederived classes codeLogWindowcode in this example from codeSnappableWindowcode.p  pHowever, what I would emreallyem want, and is prettier IMHO, isp  ol liThe ability to have this Snappable functionality as a standalone piece of code, which I can choose to plug into any other codeWindowcodederived class, or not.li liThe ability to extend this notion to other functionalities as well, for example the ability to minimize windows. So I could have a codeWindowcodederived class, with or without the Snappable ability, and with or without the Minimizable ability.li liThe implementations of SnappableWindow and MinimizableWindow both need access to codeWindowcodes codehandlecode protected member.li liI would like Snappable and Minimizable to be part of the actual class declaration, so that my actual class codeLogWindowcode is a Window, is a SnappableWindow, and is a MinimizableWindow.li ol  p... and now to the questionp  pI get how I can do this with declaring codeSnappableWindowcode and codeMinimizableWindowcode as emnotem deriving from codeWindowcode but rather getting a codehandlecode in their constructor, and then deriving codeLogWindowcode from codeWindowcode and from any combination of codeSnappableWindowcode and codeMinimizableWindowcode.p  pEDIT codehandlecode is initialized, in codeWindowcode, halfway thru LogWindows constructor, after it has called codeWindowcodes init. and not half way thru codeWindowcodes constructor, as Ive said before.p  pemHoweverem, since codehandlecode is only initialized half way thru codeLogWindowcodes constructor after it has called codeWindowcodes codeinitcode , I cant pass is to codeSnappableWindowcode and codeMinimizableWindowcode as part of codeLogWindowcodes constructor initialization list. Rather, I would have to explicitly call some codeinitcode method on both, passing it the codehandlecode. And this, in each of my codeWindowcodederived classes. codeLogWindowcode, codeSearchWindowcode, codePreferencesWindowcode, etc.p  pI am looking for a way to be able to do something likep  blockquote   pclass LogWindow  public Window, public SnappableWindow, public MinimizableWindowp blockquote  p... and not have to implement anything else inside codeLogWindowcode. Ive fiddled with virtual inheritance, but cant quite come up with the solution.p

Negative 43427 pIm using thisa hrefhttpwww.codeproject.comArticles60579AUSBLibrarytoDetectUSBDevices relnofollowlinka library to detect attach and detach events of USB devices. After detecting the right device attachedidentified with specific VIDPID combination I open a serial port connection and similarly when the device is detached I close the serial port connection.p  pMy attach event works great and at the end I get a serial port that I can use but Im having problems inside the detach event. The detach event fires correctly but when code execution reaches codecloseCOMserialPort1code point it jumps to codewndProccode override loop and prevents execution of  codecloseCOMcode and whatever follows.p  pThe library needs codeWndProccode messages to detect the events and my code is implemented like thisp  precodeCatch Windows messages and pass them to the USBClass class protected override void WndProcref Message m      USBPort.ProcessWindowsMessageref m      base.WndProcref m  codepre  pThen I have a detach event which executes the following codep  precode if USBClass.GetUSBDeviceVID, PID, ref USBDeviceProperties, false ampamp USBDeviceConnected                              Device is removed                 USBDeviceConnected  false                  Close COM port just in case we forgot to disconnect                 closeCOMserialPort1                  update status strip                 stripdevicestatus.Text  Disconnected                codepre  pand here is the codecloseCOMcode functionp  precode    This function handles COM port closing. private void closeCOMSerialPort port       If a serial port is open, disconnect it      if port.IsOpen               close the serial port          port.Close              update com port status flag         COMConnected  false          update status strip         stripCOMstatus.Text  Disconnected   codepre  pIt is codecloseCOMcode in particular thats causing this conflict because if I comment out that line everything works, except Im left with an open serial port possibly causing errors later on. What am I doing wrong thats causing the code to jump to codeWndProccode override instead of normal execution I would like to be able to do the port closing in the detach event.p

Negative 43427 pI recently began using PubNub in my iOS app, and am very happy with it. However, I have been looking at the other options available, such as Pusher and Realtime.co, which use Websockets. PubNub, on the other hand, uses long polling. I have done my own little speed comparisons and for my purposes, I find that they are all fast enough.p  pPubNub offers some nice features like message history and a list of everyone in the channel , so barring everything else I am leaning toward them.

Extensive research has shown it to be the best option for me I need a freeopen source license and a wide range of 2D geometry methods, including tangentnormal vectors at arbitrary points on a bezier, bezier offset, bezier intersection, etc. Im particularly drawn to codeCGALscode arrangements which let you do boolean operations with closed spaces, though that feature is not a makeorbreak feature. I am open to other alternatives, but I have looked into dozens of libraries to arrive at this one  Id prefer this discussion to be about CGAL than other suggestions, unless you have a particularly compelling reason to suggest another direction.p  pIdeally, Im hoping someone can give me some stepbystep guidance on how to get to the hello world of codeCGALcode in iOS.... generating a line between two points, perhaps.

Im using a current version of Xcode, and would like to stick with codeLLVMcode compiling which codeCGALcode in theory now supports.p

Negative 43427 pI created a KML file that defines several zones using polygons, in Google Earth. My plan was to just use this file on my wordpress site, along with comprehensive google maps plugin for wordpress. However, it turns out that while it works, per the developer, I am unable to set a center or zoom. I want to zoom to 10, and center at specific coordinates. I have googled and researched and I keep coming up with a few scripts, but its a bit confusing to me what i would even do with them. This is my first foray into KML. Is there something i can add into the KML file that was generated by google earth, that would  allow me to accomplish this any help would be tremendously appreciated.p

Negative 43427 pI understand from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions14277910phpexecperformancePHP exec performancea that running exec creates an overhead but in large programs or websites, wouldnt it be beneficial to have parts of the backend written in another language, and have PHP call the program using exec p  pFor instance, I wroteran a test with a large amounts of string manipulation  PHP took 2.3s while Java took .52 and C took .33. The speed difference is already obvious. The time could be sped up even more if I multithreaded the operation. I also found that parallelism can be achieved in with something like p  precodeexec.largeoperation gt mydirdirname.data amp  or execjava Backend gt devnull 2gtamp1 amp codepre  pWith all these benefits, other than the need to write code in another language, I fail to see why I shouldnt relegate more parts of my backend to a faster program written in a different language.

Negative 43427 pI have a production grails application that uses release 1.3.7.  I want to bring it up to date and use grails 2.2.0.  I did a grails upgrade directly to 2.2.0 and received a strange compile error.  I then attempted incremental upgrades from 1.3.7 to 2.0.1 and was able to get my application to compile.  When I upgrade to 2.0.2, I see the same strange compile error that I saw with the direct upgrade to 2.2.0.  The problem with the compile error is it doesnt reference any of my software, just components of grails and java.  Here is the compile errorp  p] grails compilep  p Compiling 159 source files.

Negative 43427 pI need to postprocess an output file from a model using python. The output file has a combination of data and strings. First, I want to separate the strings from data and then save the columns 0,1 and 2 from each output time only data, with no strings in a separate text file. So, for the below example, I will have 3 text files for Time0, Time0.01, Time0.04 each containing data from each output time without any header or any other strings in them.

Negative 43427 pI actually have more than one question regarding this... Im still new to NSURLCache and UIWebViews but somehow got the basics down I think.p  pAnyway, I was able to successfully implement Caching for my UIWebViewI think. I initialized the NSURLCache. My UIWebView loads its contents with the loadRequest method. I assigned the ViewController that owns the UIWebView as its delegate. I also had the ViewController implement NSURLConnectionDataDelegate. I implemented the connectionwillCacheResponse method just to log a message in the console so I could check that caching was done. I also logged the current disk and memory usage. It increases after the caching so I can see that it did work.p  pHowever, when I load the page again, I think the request is sent again to the server because the connection delegate methods like connectiondidReceiveResponse and connectionwillCacheResponse are being called.p  pI also wanted to try getting the cachedResponse from the cache by using cachedResponseForRequest. I called this method in webViewDidFinishLoad but it always returns null. Did caching really workp  pHow can you tell if the WebView loaded from the cache Am I misusing cachedResponseForRequest And on another note, what proper ControlCache header values should be present in the very least for caching Im testing on googles homepage URL and it returns the private value for its Cache Control header but I can see that caching works because the connectionwillCacheResponse is called.p  pHelp pleasep

Negative 43427 pThis has stumped me  the following code uses SpongyCastles encryptiondecryption for Android  I am trying to achieve crossplatform encryptiondecryption for iOS. p  pThe following code from Android works a treat, AES 128bit CBC with PKCS7Padding, using a supplied salt and password, which the salt is stored on the mysql database, the password is by the enduser, the following code is adapted from this answer by a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma8684273206367kelhoera. p  pThe reason I used AES128bit is that AES256 is not available in iOS 4, it was introduced in iOS5, and having to dip the toe into using codeopensslcode to generate a derived key and initialization vector iv, it was dicey as learnt that Apple rejects apps that are statically linked with openssl library. p  pSince the platform is based on iOS 4.2, having resorted to a hrefhttpwww.x2on.de20100201tutorialiphoneappwithcompiledopenssllibrary relnofollowbundling and statically linking the openssla library seems rather, overkill and would preferably use the CommonCryptor library.p  pHeres the Android version with Spongycastle code in placep  precodeprivate static void encryptInputStream fin,      OutputStream fout,

Negative 43427 pWhen I try to debug my application in the brand new Android Studio, something strange happens Instead of the intent action set in the androidManifest android.intent.action.MAIN it launches with a null intent. I had to add a catcher in the intent filter to replace null intents with android.intent.action.MAIN but surely this isnt the right way to do it. Launching the app directly from the launcher, of course, doesnt cause this. Only the debugger launch, for some strange reason.

Negative 43427 pTheres a lot going on here so Ill simplify this into a pseudo example. Forget about security and whatnot for a minute here. The point is to understand the functionality.p  pLets say Im running a local web server with node.js to dev a website. In the website, the user should be able to create a new account. The account information will be submitted via ajax to the node server. I then need the node server to take the incoming request and pass it along to another server that gives me access to a database. CouchDB, for example.p  pSo heres a pseudo example of what Id like to happen.p  pIn the clients browserp  precode.ajax   url .databasestuffwhatever,  points to the node web server   method POST,   data name Billy, age 24  codepre  pIn the Node web serverp  precodevar http      requirehttp,     dbServer  http127.0.0.15984databaseurl  http.createServerfunction req, res     figure out that we need to access the database then...      magically pass the request on to the db server   http.magicPassAlongMethodreq, dbServer, function dbResponse        pass the db servers response back to the client     dbResponse.ondata, function chunk        res.endchunk         .listen8888 codepre  pMake sense Basically whats the best way to pass the original request along to another server and then pass the response back to the clientp

Negative 43427 pI am creating a page that will display the status of several servers in a cluster. I have created a status route on my web service that simple returns ok if the server is upandrunning properly and some error if it is not. I want to have several buttons maybe better option that display green if the api call returns ok and red if not. One wrinkle is that these calls will be crossdomain albeit inside our corporate firewall.p  pSimple enough but I am a webservice developer that has nexttono experience in this area. My thought was to make a call to each servers status route on page load and set the style. I am embarrassed to say that I am honestly not sure where to start. every tutorial I find seems to be missing some piece of the puzzle for it to click for me.p  pSo, my ultimate questions is whether there is a known tutorial that meets the following criteriap  ul lihtml5CSS3 enabled preferably responsive design for mobile displayli lijqueryangularjs libraries if necessaryli licrossdomain api calls supportedli libutton drawing based on api call results.li ul  pIf this is easy enough to just show with straight html and js in a question response body that would be fine as well. the only reason I added the other pieces is that this is just one small piece of a dashboard Im building that will be integrating statistical graphs and management capabilities. So, starting with these capabilities would be ideal compared to integrating later.p  pThanks in advance. and please let me know if this question is not specific enough. I will edit.p

Negative 43427 pI understand the principle of why you can only call base class functions when assigning a derived class to a base class pointer. From my understanding of virtual tables the reason why is because only base class virtual function pointers are put into the virtual table so only they can be called but if the base class pointer points to a derived class, when the derived class constructor is called the base class virtual function is replaced with the override in the virtual table. p  pHowever my point is are there going to be problems if you have a non virtual member function in the derived class that is used in a derived class override of a virtual base class member function. p  pMy theory is there shouldnt because its a question of function access not jumps within the function, by assigning the pointer to new DerivedClass, you are assigning space for all the derived class, so access to the virtual overridden function is allowed using the pointer to the virtual function kept in the vtable. All actions from there onward are as if you were just in a derived class object so it can jump to whatever function it wants.  p  pIs this correct Or is there an issue with the jump in the function using the base class pointer as a jump reference like an array pointer  2 for function, is that how member functions are called p  pIf this is not my intention but still no issue, could it be theoretically possible to have a virtual function that takes, say an int argument. Then a switch statement inside the derived class override of the virtual function that, depending on int passed in, calls specific derived class functions thereby working around the only call base class defined virtual functions problemp  peg. skeleton with no constructors etc. and separation of declarationdefinitionp  precodeclass A     protected           virtual void AFunc            class B  public A     public           virtual void AFunc  BSpecificFunc   doable     if thats the case why not           virtual void Sfunvint temp                           switchtemp                                          case 1  BSpecificFunca  break                      case 2  BSpecificFuncb  break                      etc.                                                private           void BSpecificFunc             void BSpecificFunca            void BSpecificFuncb            void BSpecificFuncc         int main     A pBaseClass  new B     pBaseClassgtAFunc Will there be any issues doing this   codepre  pcurrently at design stage which is why I have kept this nice and theoretical. p

The reasoning behind this is that the client can have one of three different versions of the application lite, full and pro. p  pIf the client is using a lite version of the product, I wish to have the options that the lite version lacks grayed out, that way the client is able to see what they are missing.

This was also mentioned a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10400134howtoaddastaticrowtoagridviewherea as a solution to a previous issue but my problem extends beyond this point. I have a column of checkboxes that I need to store their values in a database. So I loop over the gridView rows using something like foreachGridView row. p  pDebugging my code, I realized that if I added 4 rows dynamically then the loop exits before visiting the last 4 rows of data. In other words, if my datasource originally retrieves 24 rows to be displayed on the gridview and I added 4 dynamic rows as group separator rows, the total length of the array of gridView rows attribute of the gridview object remains 24 not 28. p

Negative 43427 pThis is a followup question to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions18082211unpackingnestedcstructsinpythonmy previous question, Unpacking nested C structs in Pythona. The structs I am working with have since become more complex and I am once again not sure how to unpack and handle them completely.p  pOn the C side, the relevant part of the header looks like thisp  precodetypedef struct      uint8t seq     uint8t type     uint16t flags     uint16t upTimestamp attribute packed mpspacketheader  typedef struct      mpspacketheader header     int16t x[6]     int16t y[6]     int16t z[6]     uint16t lowTimestmp[6] attribute packed mpsaccpackett typedef mpsaccpackett accpackett  typedef struct      int16t hb1     int16t hb2  acamhbdataset  typedef struct attribute packed      mpspacketheader header     uint16t temp     uint16t lowTimestmp[8]     acamhbdataset dmsdata[8]  mpsdmspackett codepre  pTwo challenges arise from this. First, packets I receive in binary form can be either codempsaccpackettcode or codempsdmspackettcode  the only way to tell them apart is to read the codetypecode field in the codempspacketheadercode which both packet types have. This means that I need to unpack the packet before I know its full contents, which I dont know how to do cleanly as if Im not mistaken the two packet types have a different codecalcsizecode 54 and 56 respectively. The second challenge is unpacking an codempsdmspackettcode as you can see from the structs definition, this packet has an array consisting of 8 instances of codeacamhbdatasetcode, which in turn is a struct consisting of two codeint16code values. I dont know how to formulate a correct format string for this.p  pMy previous code before codempsdmspackettcode was introduced looked like this, as suggested by a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma180827132656964falsetru in his answer to my previous questionap  precodes  struct.Struct B B H H 6h 6h 6h 6H fields  s.unpackpacketdata seq, type, flags, upTimestamp  fields[4] x  fields[410] y  fields[1016] z  fields[1622] lowTimestamp  fields[22] codepre  pThis worked fine.

Negative 43427 pIve searched, but havent found an answer for this yet, so.p  pAbout 5 of the time I launch my game with ctrlenter and test the movie in Flash CS6, the game turns from 60 FPS to what seems like 120 FPS randomly, though with an FPS counter it still reads 60. It flicks on and off until I close the program. But this only happens when I launch it, about 5 of the time, usually it works just fine. What could be causing this I dont think its anything do the with the code because it randomly does this right on launch.p  pp  pAlso on a different note, when I launch my game in the external SWF file it is able to hand about 100 bitmapped enemies on screen, and when I launch it in the test IDE or launch the SWF using internet explorer it can handle 500.

Negative 43427 pI am using LazyDataModel to display the data table records, pagination, filter, sorting purpose. The records can be max 2500 around. I display 10 Records per page, so customer has to visit 250 pages if they dont know the search term. Now customer dont want to visit all the pages rather they want the implementation where they can do all the stuff being on the same page.  The other option which comes in mind is live scroll but I tried to work on PoC and come to know that LazyDataModel and Live Scroll doesnt work together. So I created a demo page independent of LazyDataModel using Live Scroll. I really like live scrolling when it comes to filter the records as it is much faster. The only thing is drill down till the end.p  pI have following questionsp  ol liHow live scroll works internallyli liDoes Live Scroll load the data all together and fetch it from heap or cache i.e. scrollRows20li liIf Live Scroll can do better then why LazyDataModelli liDont you think that pagination is all about old daysli ol

After troubleshooting I found that the problem is with reloadRowsAtIndexPaths. It does not call cellForRowAtIndexPath for the image to load. However Im still not sure it does not call cellForRowAtIndexPath. I have also tried [tableview reloadData] and no luck.p  pFIXED IT The problem was fixed by adding another tableview inside this existing table view. The way I had before was a UITableView inside a UIView. I modified it so I had one UITableView with one cell. Created a custom cell and added another table in that cell so I could scroll it horizontally and added another custom cell for the horizontal tableview with the imageview. That did the trick.p

Negative 43427 pI am learning about good design practices and came upon the Unit of Work design pattern, along with the Repository. This allows me to keep the application logic from knowing about the persistence details, however there are some corner cases that im having some difficulty dealing with.p  pFirst of all, behind the IUnitOfWork interface im using an implementation that accesses my data using EF. For my queries, i use the Specification design pattern to create query objects that the client can use.p  pSo, the thing is pretty much abstracted from the datasource until now, but heres the deal imagine i want to retrieve some data with the AsNoTracking option. How am i supposed to tell my IUnitOfWork implementation that i dont need the resulting objects to be trackedp  pMoreover, EF doesnt really support batch CUD, nor Future Queries, but there is an extension that supports. How do i support this in a way that the client code is totally agnostic to the way i persist objects I might want to use flat files, for all the code cares. p  pTLDR How do i keep my UnitOfWork abstraction from leaking into my clients Has anyone dealt with thisp

Negative 43427 pPlacing objects in shared memory is a preferred method for object reuse among a small collection of shared object Linux libraries in a project I am working on. Ive never used shared memory before, so Im a bit blind here. The uiexecutebitset app instantiates some objects preferences and miscellaneous utils then loads the libs and goes to work. The sundry util objects are small and not many in number. So far allocating a shared memory block and transferring strings has been successful. I now need to make sure the libs get access to the util objects set up by the ui.p  pAfter doing a few days of research I came up with this simple model. I named the example class POD although it is a proper class.

But the info out there in using shared memory for this specific use is pretty sparse. Im hoping a knowledgeable person will critique this code briefly and tell me whats missing, if anything.

Negative 43427 pOkay, so say that we are given two lists the preorder traversal values of a binary tree, and the inorder traversal values given in a list. Now, I need to create a tree in list form e.g. [1, [2, [2, None, None], None], [1, None, None]]. I can tell the root value and the number of elements in each side of the tree from the traversal values, but Im kind of confused as to how to create the tree itself. Is recursion a good idea for this question, seeing as how were creating subtrees within the main treep  pThis cant be done with classes, either. It has to be a function. Classes would have made it much easier, but Im not supposed to use them.p

Negative 43427 pIn many situations I need to know the sorted order of an array, not sort the array. For example, imagine there are five 5 arrays containing various information of different types string, int, double etc and the arrays are synchronized, meaning that the nth element of each array goes together. Imagine now that the first array has a name value, a string and I want to eliminate all values with duplicate names. I need to get a sort key for the name array and use that to eliminate the duplicates in all five arrays. I cannot sort the name array because then it would no longer be synchronized with the other arrays.p  pTo solve this problem I have been writing my own sort routines. Originally, I had several different versions of QuickSort depending on the data type, whether the arrays are onebased or zerobased, and what kind of sort it is, ascending, descending, casesensitive, caseinsensitive, etc and recently I have been experimenting with making various kinds of radix sorts which I have found to be faster than QuickSort for some kinds of data. My routines return sort keys, rather than sort the array itself. In other words they return an array containing integers, each integer indicating which element of the target arrays belongs in that place. So, for example, if the first value of the sort key is 43 then it means the 43rd element of the target array is the first element in the sorted order.p  pNow, while it is fascinating and educating to be writing all these sorting routines, I am wondering whether there is a better technique for doing this that allows me to leverage existing sorting libraries Is there a way I can obtain a sort key using standard library resources in JavaCp  pemstrongUpdateemstrongp  pI tried the indirect sorting method recommended by Juan Lopez and it seems to work.

Negative 43427 pI have a ListFragment that contains a Button in every list item. When the Button is clicked, the colour of the Button changes using a Drawable xml resource.

What Id really like to happen is for the color change to persist after the event fires. p  pI have tried an approach to manipulate item views via the getViewint position, View convertView, ViewGroup parent method of the ListFragments custom adapter a SimpleAdapter in my case where I could store positions of the items and persist the background state of every Button.

Negative 43427 pI am creating a website using the Candidate theme in wordpress.  There are a number of posts in my website. My home page is set to show the most recent five posts in it. I have used a plugin named as Share This to show the share buttons for facebook, twitter and google just above the contents of my posts. The buttons got displayed above the contents of the posts. Now the problem arose when the buttons got displayed in my home page too where the recent posts along with a short summary is displayed.  This started looking quite mess. I tried a lot to remove these but couldnt.p  pWhile researching for this, in some wordpress support forums, i found that the following codes may workp  precoderemovefilter gettheexcerpt, stremovestaddlink, 9  removefilter theexcerpt, staddwidget  codepre  pThis did no chage. And I used the following code toop  precodefunction removesharethis  if   issingular array post, page         removefilterthecontent, staddwidget     removefiltertheexcerpt, staddwidget     removeactionwphead, stwidgethead   addaction templateredirect, removesharethis  codepre  pIs there any way to do so I need help desperately.p  pAnd even the buttons are not seen completely. They are seen cutoff.p  pAnd there is one more problem in this. If I try sharing the posts through facebook share button of this plugin, the contents of the posts donot load at the share screen. Rather it just shows the websites name.p  pPlease help me if there is someone who has better knowledge in this sort of problems and this plugin.p

Negative 43427 pI am experiencing an very strange problem in one of the company websites. Can you help p  pDetailsp  pWe have an internal website. The authentication mode is windows hence it takes windows logins. It is served from two windows servers running Windows Server 2008 R2. And are connected with Network Load Balancer Request Handling  Round Robin.p  pEvery month there is a routine patching on the servers which leads to restart of the server not at the same time.p  pWhen restart occurs, we get Authentication prompts and it continues to give the prompt even after giving a right credentials. Popup wont go.. plain and simple.p  pNow after few hours, it gets normal. p  pI am not sure what happens.p  pWe have checked everything. IISlogs, Network Monitor Log, Load balancer log but no help as they seems equal to the other server which works fine.p  pDo you have any idea or any similar experience p

Negative 43427 pUsing Android Studios Tabbed Activity with the navigation style Tabbed Activity ViewPager to create swipeable navigation tabs. Was beginning to start figuring out how to edit fragments for each tab, so I added...p  precode        Override     public Fragment getItemint i          switch i              case 0                 return new YourFragmentClass1             case 1                 return new YourFragmentClass2             case 2                 return new YourFragmentClass3             case 3                 return new YourFragmentClass4                  return null       codepre  p...and created 4 fragment classes. When I went to run it I got a force close and told that that I needed to implement OnFragmentInteractionListener at roughly 39 places. I havent been able to find any content that solves the issue, and am a bit overwhelmed on where to start. Is there something within my main activity that needs to be resolved first, or does it lie within each of the fragment activitiesp  pstrongHeres my main activity code and my LogCatstrongp  precodepublic class MyActivity extends Activity implements ActionBar.TabListener      The link android.support.v4.view.PagerAdapter that will provide   fragments for each of the sections.

Negative 43427 pIn a classic MAKEfile, it was easy to list the main file and then all the dependent files e.g. Include files in a rule.p  pI thought that MSBuild had some attribute in the target for that, but it seems not  Given a list of input files and a transformation from input file to output file name, it runs the Target once for each input file, and skips it if the input file is not newer than the output file.p  pSo how can you retain that behavior, and furthermore NOT SKIP if any of the dependent files are newer, too  The dependent files are noted from an earlier build, and I know how to read a text file into an Item array.  But each input has a different list of dependent files, and I dont see how to tell the Target when its OK or not OK to skip.p  pI see the logic for CL the C and C compiler is not handled in the MSBuild script at all  The Task for CL, which wraps the call to cl.exe, makes that determination and simply doesnt call cl.exe.  But the Target never skips at all and feeds CL every input file.p  pI wonder if theres a useful way to do that directly in MSBuild without writing code in .NET to do the real work.p

Negative 43427 pI would like to use the new annotations and features provided in Spring 4.1 for an application that needs a JMS listener.p  pIve carefully read the notes in the a hrefhttpsspring.ioblog20140430spring41supcomingjmsimprovements relnofollowSpring 4.1 JMS improvements posta but I continue to miss the relationship between codeJmsListenercode and maybe the codeDestinationResolvercode and how I would setup the application to indicate the proper codeDestinationcode or codeEndpointcode.p  pHere is the suggested use of JmsListenerp  precodeComponent public class MyService       JmsListenercontainerFactory  myContainerFactory, destination  myQueue     public void processOrderString data  ...   codepre  pNow, I cant use this in my actual code because the myQueue needs to be read from a configuration file using codeEnvironment.getPropertycode.p  pI can setup an appropriate myContainerFactory with a codeDestinationResolvercode but mostly, it seems you would just use codeDynamicDestinationResolvercode if you dont need JNDI to lookup a queue in an app server and didnt need to do some custom reply logic.  Im simply trying to understand how Spring wants me to indicate the name of the queue in a parameterized fashion using the codeJmsListenercode annotation.p  pFurther down the blog post, I find a reference to this Configurer p  precodeConfiguration EnableJms public class AppConfig implements JmsListenerConfigurer   Override public void configureJmsListenersJmsListenerEndpointRegistrar registrar      registrar.setDefaultContainerFactorydefaultContainerFactory      SimpleJmsListenerEndpoint endpoint  new SimpleJmsListenerEndpoint     endpoint.setDestinationanotherQueue     endpoint.setMessageListenermessage gt           processing          registrar.registerEndpointendpoint  codepre  pNow, this makes some amount of sense and I could see where this would allow me to set a Destination at runtime from some external string, but this seems to be in conflict with using codeJmsListenercode as it appears to be overriding the annotation in favor of codeendpoint.setMessageListenercode in the code above.p  pAny tips on how to specify the appropriate queue name using codeJmsListenercodep

Negative 43427 pI have a create form for an entity which works the way it is supposed to.

Negative 43427 pI have figured out how to output cron jobs to a log file using codegtgtcode and providing a path to the log file. The codegtgtcode appends log information to the existing file. How can I make it so the cron job creates a new log file every time it runs i.e. codersync.logcode, codersync1.logcode, codersync2.logcode  ideally though Id like the file name of the log to be something like codeDDMMYY.logcode.p  pI want a separate log file so this one log file doesnt get so huge and ifwhen we go to look if a filefolder was successfully backed up Im running an rsync command in the cron job we dont have to comb through a MASSIVE log file.p  pAdditionally, when the cron job is outputted to the log file, there are no timedate references. Example of my first log outputp  precodesending incremental file list sent 78 bytes  received 11 bytes  35.60 bytessec total size is 0  speedup is 0.00 codepre  pThats it. The timestamp on this logfile will keep changing every time the job is run, so we wouldnt even be able to tell what day that particular filefolder was copied via rsync.

Negative 43427 pTrying to sort data in Excel alphabetically by row, but NOT in all of the columns for each row. For example Sort J7 through U7 alphabetically, then J8 through U8, all the way down through J2000 through U2000, while keeping each item within its row like all cells in row 7 should still be in row 7 by the end of it.p  pIt seems like Ill need to use a macroVBA for this, as Excel only lets you sort one row at a time alphabetically. If I select more than one row to sort, it still only sorts the first row. I have done a bit of research as far as what kind of macros I could use for this, but nothing seems to do the job. The one thing I found that was similar to this sorts by number, but cant sort alphabetically.p  pHeres what Ive got at a moment.

It seems like there are a few different ways to use variables instead of directly naming the columns, which Ill need to do to reference a new row through each iteration.

Negative 43427 pIve been a procedural programmer for a long time and most of my iOS code is written with lots of if statements instead of subclassing. I think I finally understand how to write object oriented code but I have a few questions.p  pI have a class, ScoringToolbar.m that is used in all of my games. It creates buttons for the bottom of the screen. Which buttons are created vary depending on the game and the options in the game. Heres a typical screen.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comeFtXq.png altScoring Toolbarp  pRight now it is a long series of if statements. In addition to being hard to read, its definitely not proper object oriented programming. What Id like to do is convert the class into a superclass and add a subclass for each game. My first question is Is there a convention for naming the superclassp  pAlso, Id like to keep the ScoringToolbar.m name for each of my subclasses. If I create one subclass for each of my apps or group of similar apps I can move the code from the if statements into it. Then each app would call its own subclass and create the buttons it needs. If I do that I wont have to change any of the calling code. However, if I have lots of .m files with the same name, what do I do with the .h files. Do I have just one and make sure it works with all of the .ms. Or is there a way to tell Xcode to use a specific .h file in an appp  pOr is this the wrong approach altogetherp
Negative 43427 pguys.  Im new to PHP and Wordpress and Ive been stuck on this for hours and hours.  Im basically trying to put some code in the loop to output the current Wordpress slug and I dont think FirePHP, the only solution I have up and running, can do that.  My understanding is that the loop comes after http headers are sent and that you have to call FirePHP fb.php before the headers are sentIm assuming thats correct.  What solution would you guys recommend for a newb like me  The output can go into a browser, third party app, log file, etc.  I dont care.  I just want the data.  Your suggestions are welcome, thanks.p

Negative 43427 pIm using Javascript to render an embedded Google Map canvas on my website.p  pThe inputs to the rendering are latlng coordinates that are retrieved from a database.

Negative 43427 pIm using OrientDB 2.0.0 to test its handling of bulk data loading. For sample data, Im using the GDELT dataset from Googles GDELT Project free download. Im loading a total of 80M vertices, each with 8 properties, into the V class of a blank graph database using the Java API.p  pThe data is in a single tabdelimited text file codeUSASCIIcode, so Im simply reading the text file from top to bottom. I configured the database using codeOIntentMassiveInsertcode, and set the transaction size to 25,000 records per commit.p  pIm using an 8core machine with 32G RAM and an SSD, so the hardware should not be a factor. Im running Windows 7 Pro with Java 8r31. p  pThe first 20M or so records went in quite quickly, at under 2 seconds per batch of 25,000. I was very encouraged.p  pHowever, as the process has continued to run, the insert rate has slowed significantly. The slowing appears to be pretty linear. Here are some sample lines from my output logp  precodeCommitted 25000 GDELT Event records to OrientDB in 4.09989189 seconds at a rate of 6097 records per second. Total  31350000 Committed 25000 GDELT Event records to OrientDB in 9.42005182 seconds at a rate of 2653 records per second. Total  40000000 Committed 25000 GDELT Event records to OrientDB in 15.883908716 seconds at a rate of 1573 records per second. Total  45000000 Committed 25000 GDELT Event records to OrientDB in 45.814514946 seconds at a rate of 545 records per second. Total  50000000 codepre  pAs the operation has progressed, the memory usage has been pretty constant, but the CPU usage by OrientDB has climbed higher and higher, keeping consistent with the duration. In the beginning, the OrientDB Java process was using about 5 CPU. It is now up to about 90, with the utilization being nicely distributed across all 8 cores.p  pShould I break the load operation down into several sequential connections, or is it really a function of how the vertex data is being managed internally and it would not matter if I stopped the process and continued inserting where I left off p  pThanks.p  p[Update] The process eventually died with the error      java.lang.OutOfMemoryError GC overhead limit exceededp  pAll commits were successfully processed, and I ended up with a little over 51m records. Ill look at restructuring the loader to break the 1 giant file into many smaller files say, 1m records each, for example and treat each file as a separate load.p  pOnce that completes, I will attempt to take the flat Vertex list and add some Edges. Any suggestions how to do that in the context of a bulk insert, where vertex IDs have not yet been assigned Thanks.p  p[Update 2] Im using the Graph API.

Negative 43427 pIs there a way to determine that a single char is valid when a regular expression expects a specific number of that charp  pI have a WPF custom keyboard and would like to adjust each keys availability based on a regular expression. This will work well when the expression is fairly simple and does not expect specific order of the chars or a specific length to satisfy the pattern.p  pHowever, when the pattern becomes more complex and specific, testing a single char against it will always fail.p  pFor instance, given the regular expression code[azAZ09]4codep  pThese values will succeedp  ul liABCD li liabcd li li1234 li liA23eli ul  pThe expression clearly expects alphanumerical chars only.

Negative 43427 pFirstly I know what your thinking, its a strange question and it seems like it cannot be true but here me out on this one...p  pThe project is a project which sends an array of bytes over a socket and also receives data from a socket. I am currently working on protection. I want to make sure that the user knows when the socket cant connect for whatever reason... You can view the connection code below.p  pSo I have an android app which connects to a executable on a Windows Server computer in a office elsewhere in the world. The socket connects via the usual IP address and port number.p  pI am testing the app using a Android 5.0 lollipop phone...p  pNow enough of the boring stuff If I close the server and turn it off completely and test this on wifi then the socket fails  which is correct.

But in this case, Appfabric is startingresuming my workflows  so I have no reference to codeWorkflowApplicationcode. If Im forced to start or resume each workflow instance manually, that makes Appfabric rather pointless.pli lipQuery the Appfabric persistence table in SQL server directly. So if the schema ever changes, its likely this code will break. Also means I have to deal with 2 databases simultaneously, with all of the latency issues that brings forth. pli lipRecommended method Use a custom tracking participant. As far as I can tell none of the codeTrackingRecordcode objects emitted will tell you when a bookmark is set. There are codeTrackingRecordcode objects emitted for change of state in a codeStateMachinecode activity, but this would have two implications 1. All waiting for input would have to occur within a codeStateMachinecode not a showstopper, but very constraining, and 2. Having more than one wait state would get complex.pli ul

Negative 43427 pI am working on an ASP.NET MVC 3 ASPX website. I have created a codeViewcode called codeIndexcode and this codeViewcode is responsible to generate a number of codedivscode of different colours, which afterwards are supposed to be used by a user. The user will be presented with a number of clickable areas divs, which change colours on mouse click. This I can do easily in Javascript. The problem is that down the page I have a submit button, which has to take all the data from previous input fields and also a list of codedivscode that were selected by the user and send it further to my C code. p  pI have no idea how to create this list and keep it until user sends it further to the C code, because I suppose it should be Javascript that keeps this list. Otherwise, it should be C code on the server that gets an integer describing which codedivcode was selected every time a user clicks on a codedivcode.p  pWhat is the easiest and most elegant way to create this list of codedivcode indices and send it further to the server, when all data also other input fields is combinedp  pThis is my sketch explaining the structure of my websitep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comEiWOe.jpg altenter image description herep

Negative 43427 pI was asked to implement a circular buffer that takes strongan unspecified typestrong in C. I assume the generic type to be of strongprimitive typestrong. or should it consider nonprimitive types For the buffer, I am using a strongbasic array, e.g. T[]strong with strongnewstrong and strongdeletestrong to initialize and destroy it. p  pI have implemented the buffer class and tested it on integers with the expected output. But it does not work on codestdstringcode. The problem is that, when I pop the buffer, I clear the element by setting it to zero, and the compiler complains that doing so is ambiguous. As such, I need a generic way to clear an element, and I thought the codestdarraycode might support this feature, but I cannot find it in the documentation.p  pIs there a generic way to clear an element in a stdarray or basic array, or is stdallocator my only option Or, if I am completely in the wrong direction, How should I implement the pop method to strongreset the first element and increment the front index to that of the next elementstrongp  pThanks in advancep  pIn case it helps, below is my related codep  precodetemplateltclass Tgt T CircularBufferltTgtpopfront      if size  0         return 0     T value  buffer[front]     buffer[front]  0     if size  0              front  1         back  1          else              front  front  1  capacity          return value  codepre

Negative 43427 pI use the after pseudoelement to simulate a gradient transition, but my gradients can be different, so I created a class for each one of them and applied them with JS when I needed them. Of course in the general codeaftercode I specify codetransition opacity 1scode and in each one of the gradient classes I have a background and codeopacity 1code. Now I stumbled upon a problem, I need to reverse the transition, but that wasnt so easy, because since I use JS, I am removing the class, which means that the opacity transition will of course still run, but the background gets deleted immediately. How can I keep the background until the opacity transition endsp  pstrongJSFiddlestrong a hrefhttpjsfiddle.net5c7xfwLw relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.net5c7xfwLwap

Additionally, if I remove the 2nd field in the series it doesnt actually remove that instance, it just reduces the count so instead of having field 1 and field 3 like I should, I actually have field 1 and field 2.p  pThe end result in all of this is to submit to the process page and have a loop iterate through the total  of added fields and insert them into a db.p  pIm new to angularjs so Im not sure that the method I am attempting is even best practice as it seems to be overly complex, so I am open to suggestions on how to improve the process as well.p  pstrongHTMLstrongp  precode ltdiv ngrepeatsubcontractor in subcontractorsgt    ltdiv classwell wellsmgtSubcontractor subcontractor.idltspan idsubCountergtltspangt      ltbutton typebutton ngclickremoveSub classclose arialabelClosegtltspan ariahiddentruegtamptimesltspangtltbuttongt    ltdivgt    ltdiv classformgroupgt      ltdiv classcolmd6gt        ltlabel forsubNamegtSubcontractor Nameltlabelgt        ltinput typetext classformcontrol idsubName namesubName placeholderSubcontractor ngmodelformData.subName[subNameindex1]gt      ltdivgt      ltbutton typebutton classbtn btninfo btnsm pullright ngshowshowAddSubsubcontractor ngclickaddNewSubgt[] Add New Subltbuttongt  ltdivgt codepre  pstrongANGULARJSstrongp  precodescope.addNewSub  function    var newItemNo  scope.subcontractors.length1   scope.subcontractors.pushid newItemNo   scope.removeSub  function    var newItemNo  scope.subcontractors.length1   scope.subcontractors.splicescope.subcontractors1, 1   scope.showAddSub  functionsubcontractor    return subcontractor.id  scope.subcontractors[scope.subcontractors.length1].id  codepre

Negative 43427 pI have 30 files UE1.dat, UE2.dat, ......, all of the them consist of 2 columns the first one is the delay and the second one is its CDF. So because i dont have the CDF value for all delays in the range [100600], i had to interpolate the second columns according to the first one in all those 30 files and after that to normalize the data between 0 and 1. Everything works perfect until now. p  pIn the end I have to plot a graph, which consists of x, y and the y errorbars. codexcode is the range 1001600, codeycode is the mean for every row of the interpolated data for every codexcode from 100 to 600 by step 1, and for the y errorbars I calculate the standard deviation for every y row as well. p  pBut when I plot the data with error bars it looks weird and i have some strange x dashes, while if I plot only x against y everything looks good.

Negative 43427 pstrongConditionsstrong I created a classic web site that tracked equipment and I am now converting it to ASP.NET. I have a page that shows information about a specific piece of equipment as well as details specific to the type of equipment I am looking at. An example of equipment types would be Cars, Boats, Plans and bicycles. All of these things have information that is the same such as Manufacturer, Model number, cost, purchase date, etc... but they also have different details that are specific to their type however, some details overlap. For instance both a car and a bicycle have wheels but the boat doesnt. However, a car and a boat have an engine but a bicycle doesnt if we leave out the human.p  pWhen I open the web page for a specific item I want the details for that item type to show and be data bound so that display and edits work correctly. I have found many ways of adding the specific details depending on what type was selected but the only one that allows me to perform a Data Bind similar to a declarative control using lt BindHorsepower  is to create a user control, Register it on the page and either add the user control declaratively or dynamically in a place holder. These methods work, the controls are data bound correctly, will display the data and will allow updates the user controls are located in a FormView which is data bound to a SqlDataSource.p  pEach equipment type has its own details user control so that only the details for that type are shown. In the database the details table has a column for each detail being tracked regardless of type. For instance the details for a car and a boat would both be kept in the details table but the column showing tire size would be left empty for the boat.p  pMy problem occurs when I register the user control for the all the different detail types. Since some details overlap from type to type i.e. a plane and a car both have wheels all the controls connect to the SqlDataSource when the page loads at whatever point data binding takes place I have code in place that will only allow the correct control to display and looking at the source of the web page no other control even has code on the page, visible or not. Visually everything is perfect and changing types displays the correct user control. However, since all user controls are registered using the lt Register  directive they all try to connect to the SqlDataSource which means, I dont know, only the last one to connect is actually connected p  pIf I only declareregister one control everything works fine. As soon as I add a second control with an overlapping data column name data binding doesnt seem to work or is only for the last control. I deliberately changed the databind to remove overlaps and this allowed all the controls to work but obviously the table columns are not being reused i.e. cars and bicycles both have wheels so the wheels column would have an entry for both types.p  pWhat I need is the ability to show the specific details based on equipment type and have those details databound back to a SqlDataSource for viewing, updates and inserts. I can add the user controls to a placholder no problem but databinding either doesnt happen at all or only the last control registered has the correct databinding.p  pIm trying to avoid going back to Classic ASP methods. There has to be an  ASP.NET solution somewhere.p  pThanks,p

In the URL of that page, a parameter coderedirecturihttp3A2F2F192.0.2.03A100812Fcode is visible.

In nonograms row and columns can be filled in different ways that must satisfy a constriction.p  pAs an example, if a row has the constraint [2,3,2] and length 10, it means 2 adjecent cells must be filled, then a blank, then 3 adjecent, a blank and finally 2 adjecent.p  pAll the possible combinations would then bep  p[2,3,2]  x x  x x x  x x  br [2,3,2]  x x  x x x   x x br [2,3,2]  x x   x x x  x x br [2,3,2]   x x  x x x  x x brp  pI imagined it would be quite easy creating a general function for calculating all possible combinations for any row length and constraint, but Ive been trying this the whole weekend and its driving me insane Any help is very much appreciated.p

Negative 43427 pI have read in different post on stackoverflow and in the C documentation, that converting codelongcode or any other data type representing a number to codedoublecode loses precision. This is quite obvious due to the representation of floating point numbers.p  pMy question is, how big is the loss of precision if I convert a larger number to codedoublecode Do I have to expect differences larger than  X p  pThe reason I would like to know this, is that I have to deal with a continuous counter which is a codelongcode. This value is read by my application as codestringcode, needs to be cast and has to be divided by e.g. 10 or some other small number and is then processed further.p  pWould codedecimalcode be more appropriate for this task p
