Positive 32884 pI am building mobile apps for iOS and Android using PhoneGap Build. I would like to send push notifications to both types of device using the same serverside process. Is this possiblep  pApples certification process to enable push notifications is painful, much more so than anything available for Android. Do I have to use itp  pGCM Google Cloud Messaging says it supports both operating systems, but the more I read about it  with respect to Phonegap  the less I see iOS mentioned And sadly the GCMPhonegap plugin doesnt support emsubscribing to a topicem, which is a way of sending one message out to all devices in one go via a global topic.p  pUrbanAirship and PushWhoosh seem to integrate with Phonegap, but I am forced to use their website to create my messages. GCM looks more attractive in this respect, because I can get our own ASP.NET server to talk to GCM via HTTP and thus control messages from our databases.p  pstrongMain question Are there any options for a single serverside option which can send push notifications to both iOS and Android via a single Phonegap pluginstrong Ideally I would control messages from my own server, where one message can go to all AndroidiOS devices in one go, and avoid as many Apple certificates as possible.p

Negative 32884 pWith thanks to Rich Bradshawp  pIm looking for optimal strategies for the following puzzle.   p  pAs the new fairy king, it is your duty to map the kingdoms custard swamp.br  The swamp is covered in an ethereal mist, with islands of custard scattered throughout.br  You can send your pixies across the swamp, with instructions to fly low or high at each point.br  If a pixie swoops down over a custard, it will be distracted and wont complete its sequence. Since the mist is so thick, all you know is whether a pixie got to the other side or not.p  pIn coding terms..   p  precodebool flutter bool[size] swoopmap  codepre  pThis returns whether a pixie exited for a given sequence of swoops. p  pThe simplest way is to pass in sequences with only one swoop.

Negative 32884 pIs this possible.. for example, imagine I respond to a request with a 302 or 303, and I inform the browser to do a request to a given location.. is there a header that I can send with the HTTP 302, so that the subsequent request from the browser would include that headerp  pI know I could do this with the location header, as in redirect and specify the information in the url as a query string.. but Im wondering if there is a better way.. it seems that it should be a legit scenario..p  pContent has moved, go here .. oh and youll want to take this with you to give to the redirect locationp  pIm guessing a big fat nop  pThanks in advance.p  phr p  pstrongEditstrongp  pThe reason for this is in respect to PRG patterns, where you have a GET url and POST url, given that you post data and it isnt acceptable, the server redirects you to the GET, and does some magic in order to send data to that GET, using most often session state to store a variable.p  pHowever this emcanem breakdown in scenarios where many of these PRG requests are happening, granted this isnt a common scenario and generally nobody need worry about this.. but if you do youll need a way to identify the requests, this can be done with query string parameters send in the 302.. so that a specific entry can be put in session state according to that request.p  pThe question was regarding trying to remove the request key from the url, and making it more implicit.. cookies appear to work, but they only make the window for screw ups smaller.p  pIt would be great to say when you go the location ive specified, send these parameters.p  phr p  pstrongEditstrongp  pJust to note, Im not trying to get the browser to send arbitrary headers to the location, but if there is ANY headers designed to hint the context of the request like the querystring parameters could.p

In my application I have this large file 256MB which contains fixed records of about 160 byteseach. This application has a rather lengthy process in which, over time, it will be randomly accessing about 90 of the file for reading and writing. Any given record write will not be more than 1,000 record accesses away from the read of that particular record I can tune this value.p  pI have two obvious options for this process regular IO FileRead, FileWrite and memory mapping CreateFileMapping, MapViewOfFile. The latter should be much more efficient in systems with enough memory, but in systems with low memory it will swap out most of other applications memory, which in my application is a nono. Is there a way to keep the process from eating up all memory e.g., like forcing the flushing of memory pages Im no longer accessing If this is not possible, then I must resort back to regular IO I would have liked to use overlapped IO for the writing part since access is so random, but documentation says a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryt7e3td2c.aspxwrites of less than 64K are always served synchronouslya.p  pAny ideas for improving IO are welcomed.p

Negative 32884 pI am writing code in Java that uses an unordered, rooted tree where each node may have any number of child nodes. Given a tree T and a subtree S, I want to be able to find all the subtrees in T that match S that is all the subtrees in T that are isomorphic to S.p  pA subtree of T is isomorphic to S, if the nodes of S can be mapped to nodes of T in such a way that the edges of S map to edges in T.p  pA a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions584696easywaytofindsubtreeinatreeprevious questiona has been asked on how to find if a tree contains another subtree however I want to be able to find bALLb subtrees in T that match S. In addition I want to be able to map from each node in each match in T to the corresponding node in S. p  pThat is, when a match is found, it should be returned not simply as a pointer to the node in T where a tree is rooted that matches S, but the match should be returned as something like a list of pairs of pointers to nodes [T1,S1,T2,S2,...Tn,Sn] such that T1 is a pointer to a node in T that maps to node S1 in the subtree and so on. p  pAlternatively simply a list of pairs of values could be returned as each node in tree T and subtree S has a unique integer identifier associated with it.p  pFor examplep  pGiven tree T as followsp  precode    a        b   c      d   e codepre  pand subtree S asp  precode    x        y   z codepre  pthe following list of matches should be returnedp  blockquote   p[a,x,b,y,c,z]   [b,x,d,y,e,z]p blockquote  pA unique match is determined by the set of nodes in T, bnotb the mapping between the nodes in T and S. p  pSo the following matchp  blockquote   p[a,x,b,bzb,c,byb]p blockquote  pis considered to be duplicate of p  blockquote   p[a,x,b,strongystrong,c,strongzstrong]p blockquote  pbecause they have the same set of nodes from T a,b,c so only one of the matches should be returned.p  pAs another example, given tree Tp  precode    a       b c d codepre  pand subtree Sp  precode  x      y   z codepre  pthe following list of matches should be returnedp  blockquote   p[a,x,b,y,c,z]   [a,x,b,y,d,z]   [a,x,c,y,d,z]p blockquote  pCan anyone give any example code of how to do thisp  pstrongEdit in relation to Chris Kannons commentstrong   p  blockquote   pIm thinking you want someone to code   the answer for you How far have you   gotten What code have you written    Chris Kannon 1 hour agop blockquote  pI have the following code which when run, builds up a list matchesList of pointers to nodes in the tree where subtrees are rooted that match the given subtree.

Negative 32884 pIve been having a problem thats plagued me many times in the course of developing a Flash project.

In the past, I have run into this issue when trying to dynamically create ScrollPanes in code. I have solved it by adding ScrollPane components to my Main.flas library. This seemed to work for a while.p  pNow, I am trying to use an AstraFlash AutoComplete box. I have imported the proper fla files into CS4, and placed an AutoComplete box into my Swf. Everything builds fine, but the above error occurs when the Swf is loaded. My thought is that the AutoComplete box is trying to create a ScrollPane as part of its functionality. Ok, I understand this, so I add the ScrollPane component to the library as well with the same results.p  pUsually I would just mess with the library componentssettings until I get rid of the error, but Im sick of running into this, and I want to know the correct way to solve the problem.

Assuming the AS3 code is correct, and I am still getting the above error, what settings do you think are probably incorrect Out of frustration, I have tried adding every possible component to the library, as well as to the librarys component assets folder just to have a starting point, but I still get the error.p  pAny help is appreciated.p
Negative 32884 pThis is not really a technical programming question, but has more to do with best practices and programming  project management processes. Heres some background informationp  pIm a consultant with an agile scrum software development company that specializes in the Java, J2EE, Flex technology stack.p  pHere it is generally perceived by many that the quality of PHP related people, projects etc. isnt up to the mark as compared to Java. While I often contest that claim, I do accept that there is an overall low barrier to entry into PHP which does occasionally attract lower quality people who then produce lower quality work.p  pFor us, quality comes first. Over the course of the next few quarters we also are looking to develop a very high level of competency in PHP. And we want to achieve the highest level of quality and our processes should be such that we are constantly improving all the time while starting off as a high level.p  pOur new recruits are going through a rigorous selection process where there is a very hands on technical assignment. We evaluate how they code, we evaluate how they test their code, we evaluate their skills with industry standard frameworks Zend, CakePHP, CodeIgniterKohana, Symphony.p  pWe have a bimonthly twice a month knowledge exchange event where individuals are encourages to present. We have hands on events as well.p  pI would request you to share your experience on how we as individuals and an a flat, agile, relatively small organization can instill good PHP development practices and constantly improve ourselves.p  pThanks, Srip

The relation of these tables will exactly match what Im trying to do.p  pEach house can have one or more driver, and each driver has exactly one car. Right now, Im just trying to get it working with one house, one driver, and one car. The user should first see a form called HouseInformation which will ask them to fill in information about their house. Then they will see DriverInformation which will ask them to fill in information about themselves. Then they will see CarInformation which will ask them to fill in information about their car. After they are done, there will be one record in each table. The record in Drivers will contain HouseId, matching the corresponding house, and the record in Cars will contain DriverId, matching the corresponding driver. I dont especially care how the forms are linked, just that they are and that it works reliably.p  pFor what its worth, Ive also tried numerous other methods of loading the form and setting its foreign key id. None of them have caused the form to pull in the data from the previous forms table, even though this exact pattern does work between the first two forms.p  hr  pstrongMore updatesstrongp  pSubforms are not acceptable to the client, who specifically requested separate forms.p  pI find this extraordinarily confusing, but after Form3 loads, if I close it, go into design view, open the query for Form3 and switch to datasheet view, the correct data is there, including the fields I want from Form2. It just wont show up on the form. I requeried. It makes no difference. It wont show up.p

The two classes tempConvertSoap and TempConvet are generated by wsimport.  I am also using several libraries from javax.jws.. and javax.xml.ws..

I have taken this same application and created a standard java client application and it works fine  of course with all of the android stuff taken out.  What would be a good debug strategy  What methods and techniques would you recommend I try and isolate the problem  I am thinking that there is some sort of Dalvik VM incompatibility that is causing the TempConvert class not to load.  TempConvert is an interface class that references a lot of very tricky webservice attributes.  Any help with debug strategies would be gladly appreciated.p  pThanks for the help, Stevep

Extract each jars directory tree and dump them together in a shared directory, then make a jar of this directory, so all the files in it are signed by the same certificate  one jar, one certificate, right.. However, spring STILL expects the files to be organized like this distlibsbcProv.jar, instead of distlibsallLibs.jar, where all libraries are dumped into the allLibs.jar. The approach fails miserably because spring cant find any of the libraries when deployed through JWS.p  pApproach 2. Sign all jars manually WITH the SAME certificate. After spending 10 minutes manually signing the jars,  this approach also fails AND has the audacity to throw an error that bcProv.jar is NOT signed with the same certificate as the others. p  pI am puzzled, baffled and confused.

Negative 32884 pEach member of our development team has a copy of our applications database running on a local version of SQL Server 2008 Enterprise with SP1. Everyone is able to access the database by specifying their server and instance name in their web.config file, but to best share the developer version of our web.config file, we have standardized on making connections strings generic by using integrated security and setting server property to local. This strategy is working fine for the majority of our 64bit Windows 7 machines but in few cases local isnt recognized. We have compared settings via the SQL Server Configuration Manager namely ensuring that the named pipes protocol was enabled and weve tried setting the local alias via SQL Server Client Network Utility, but we havent any luck.

Negative 32884 pI have been asked to investigate the usefulness of linq to sql for a reporting application we are building. Our reporting table is a sql server wide table with many thousands of columns of different types String1500, Int1500 etc. It holds the results from dynamic reports constructed by the user.p  pWe have a second table that maps a report field to a column on the reporting table with a type ordinal pair i.e. column String1.p  pI know it should be possible to construct expression trees against a linq to sql dbml class that can return the report results. I would like to take this a bit further and return only the columns that map to fields and return a dynamic type as the result.p  pAlso to avoid maintaining the huge reporting table class in the dbml.p  pstrongIs it possible to run a dynamic linq query against a table not in the dbml, i.e. not a linq to sql entitystrongp  pI realise this is a bastardisation of L2S and I am not fond of it. I am considering using plain old ADO and returning an untype result set.p  pMany thanks,p  pIanp

Negative 32884 pThis question os partially a Drupal question and partially a SQL question. I have decided to implement quite a few features on my site as nodes due to the ease and flexibility of all the node related modules. Drupal stores the basic information about a nodes in the Node table. Potentially my node table is going to be huge, perhaps with millions of rows. I understand from reading the documentation that large tables can slow down queries, particularly in Joins. What i dont really understand is how to quantify that. I know that the specific query, the hardware and a number of other factors are involved, but Im wondering all other variables being equal, is there some sort of equation of table size to query time would a table with 100,000 rows take 10 times as long to execute a query than one with 10,000 rowsp

Negative 32884 pIm a little bit confused about these two methods in Android. p  pFrom the documentation I understand that codeonSaveInstanceStatecode should be called to store only temporary information, and codeonPausecode should be used to store any persistent data. p  pI was wondering why to call codeonSaveInstancecode at all, when codeonPausecode is called every time. Then I read in the Notepad tutorial  p  blockquote   pNote that codesaveStatecode must be   called in both codeonSaveInstanceStatecode   and codeonPausecode to ensure that the   data is saved. This is because there   is no guarantee that   codeonSaveInstanceStatecode will be called   and because when it is called, it is   called before codeonPausecode.p blockquote  pThere is no guarantee that codeonSaveInstanceStatecode will be called because you can simply walk out of the activity using the back button. p  pBut according to this if you dont save the persistent data inside both methods, the app might be killed while inside codeonSaveInstanceStatecode. p  pSo we need to save the persistent data in both methods actually, am I right p  pBut if this is true, isnt this too much of an overhead and maybe there should be some other additional flag to tell if the method is already called or something   p  pa hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comresourcestutorialsnotepadnotepadex3.htmlhttpdeveloper.android.comresourcestutorialsnotepadnotepadex3.htmlap

Negative 32884 pIm building a concept application with MVC 3 in an attempt to learn its ways. Ive previously done some very heavyduty applications in WebForms, using an ntier approach, usually consisting of domain objects with repositories for storage and services to manipulate them before storage.p  pIm trying to reconcile how I used to do things with the right way to do them in MVC, if there is any one such way. The thing Im getting hung up over right now is when to use ViewModels versus when to use my domain objects that are in a whole other project. Validation is done with ViewModels, but as I write more customized, businesslogic validation, it seems like its too much responsibility on a lowly ViewModel that was just there to help me move data around before storing it officially in the database through the repository layer.p  pIm also getting tired of mapping ViewModel data to the official domain object that the repository stores and retrieves, but I feel like I shouldnt tarnish my domain objects with the MVC attributes for validation, either.p  pDo you have any advice for where to draw the line between domain objects and mere ViewModels Or am I complicating things, and my ViewModels should actually be the official models that the repository storesp

Negative 32884 pI have been porting a Winforms app to WPF and have noticed the following regarding administrative rights.

Negative 32884 pIm trying to ensure that I dont commit code that uses tab characters for indentation.

For example, for me, by default, trailing whitespace is highlighted and windows newlines are also visible in the diff, so if Im about to accidentally commit code with trailing whitespace, I will be alerted to this.

Negative 32884 pIm using NHibernate and ODP.NET to connect to a Oracle 11g database. Of course there can be connection errors network failure, DB down, .... Im handling all these exceptions in my code, so no problem there. But of course the user can retry his actions maybe it was just a short network failure, and there comes my problemp  pODP.NET is using connection pooling by default. No problem with that usually, but when the user retries an action after a connection error, NHibernate gets an invalid pooled connection from ODP.NET. The user has to retry it multiple times until the pool is empty to get it working again.p  pOf course I can disable connection pooling in ODP.NET, but Id like to avoid that. Ive also read about a setting that checks the connection to the DB for each returned connection from the pool, but this adds an additional round trip to each connection which Id like to avoid too.p  pIs there any way to configure ODP.NET to automatically clear the connection pool when any connection throws an connection exceptionp
Negative 32884 pFirst post here. Recently I have been spending a lot of time learning JavaScript. Ive been using the jQuery library and I just now learned that ajax calls will NOT work on portions of the page which are dynamically loaded without refreshing. Naturally, I need ajax functionality for these posts as well. I need help understanding the best way to work around this annoyance.p  pYes, I have read and saw what was said in the jQuery FAQ, but to me it was vague and noninformative, but did provide some basic information a hrefhttpdocs.jquery.comFrequentlyAskedQuestionsWhydomyeventsstopworkingafteranAJAXrequest.3F relnofollowhttpdocs.jquery.comFrequentlyAskedQuestionsWhydomyeventsstopworkingafteranAJAXrequest.3Fap  pSpecifically, I am making a userprofile page, similar in concept to a facebook profile page. Users post comments to other users, and new comments are automatically loaded onto the page using jQuerys ajax functionality. Each comment has buttons such as Delete, Like, Reply, etc which work great with ajax, but they do not work at all for comments that are automatically loaded onto the page...p  pI found out about the delegate method, which I understand is how some people get past this. So far all that I have in my code is thisp  precodedocument.delegateimg, click, function alerttest Stub  codepre  pThis works, but THE PROBLEM IS I already have jQuery methods which I wrote to handle every single one of my ajax calls. I cant figure out how to use delegate to call the jQuery code blocks that I already wrote. Is it possible For example, this loads a comment box underneath the comment of which the user clicked the Reply buttonp  precodeimg.wallpostreply.clickfunction this.closestdiv.wallpost.finddiv.wallreply.slideDownfast Toggle the window  this.closestdiv.wallpost.findtextarea.wallpostinput.focus Focus on the textarea  codepre  pThis is very simple block of code works perfectly, similar to many other small blocks of code which I have. This one gets called when the user clicks on the Reply image, like thisp  precodeltimg classwallpostreply stylecursorpointer src.imagesreply.png altReply gt codepre  pHow can I assign delegate to link up with the jQuery code that I already wrote Is this even possible I would rather not write completely new functions which have the same functionality, if possible.p

Negative 32884 pIm creating an iPhone application. I have a .plist file that contains a dictionary of words around 180K of them.p  pThere is a textField where the user begins typing a word. As he types, I use the delegate method codetextFieldshouldChangeCharactersInRangereplacementStringcode to make sure that he only enters abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ. p  pWhen the user first taps in the textField, I load an NSMutableArray called codefinalWordscode declared in the header, retained and synthesized with the contents of the .plist each word is an NSString.

This code works in the sense that it whittles down the possible words the user is typing as he goes. This way, as soon as he types a letter that makes it so he cannot complete it to a word, I dont allow the letter to be entered. Also, once there is a unique completion, I go ahead and fill the textField with the completed word. p  pThe problem is that this is painfully slow at first It takes several seconds for the first letter, and not much less for the second. By the third, the speed is somewhat reasonable. Is there a way that I can drastically speed up this filtering processp  pThanks.p

Negative 32884 pIn my app, I want to support a blank date field as meaning some indefinite date in the future, both upon entry and viewing.  Since Im storing this in the database and nil sorts before any nonnil date, I decided to monkeypatch the Date class to implement a maxvalue method that returns 1110000 the date I picked to represent an indefinite date in the future.  I have been overloading , , tos, and other operatorsmethods to behave appropriately with this value.  I then added a beforesave callback to the model to convert any blank dates to Date.maxvalue.  This all seems to work with the exception of a few bugs Im trying to work out, but is there a better way to do this without monkeypatching the classp

In Spring Security, the filter classes are also Spring beans defined in the application context and thus able to take advantage of Springs rich dependencyinjection facilities and lifecycle interfaces. Springs codeDelegatingFilterProxycode provides the link between codeweb.xmlcode and the application context.p      pWhen using DelegatingFilterProxy, you will see something like this in the codeweb.xmlcode filep  precodeltfiltergt   ltfilternamegtmyFilterltfilternamegt   ltfilterclassgtorg.springframework.web.filter.DelegatingFilterProxyltfilterclassgt ltfiltergt  ltfiltermappinggt   ltfilternamegtmyFilterltfilternamegt   lturlpatterngtlturlpatterngt ltfiltermappinggt codepre      pNotice that the filter is actually a codeDelegatingFilterProxycode, and not the class that will actually implement the logic of the filter. What codeDelegatingFilterProxycode does is delegate the Filters methods through to a bean which is obtained from the Spring application context. This enables the bean to benefit from the Spring web application context lifecycle support and configuration flexibility. The bean must implement codejavax.servlet.Filtercode and it must have the same name as that in the filtername element.

Negative 32884 pI have built into our ORM layer object caching. Basically a hash of the SQL query is used as the key and the value contains the collection of objects from the DB resultset. However this creates a problem if one of the objects in the resultset is updated the cached resultset does not include the updated object. There is no write consistency. How would I implement write consistencyp  pThanksp  pUPDATE Currently I have an ObjectWatcher class that handles what objects are cached and their keys. Objects are cached with retrievable keys so for Person class its Person.101 for example. The SQL query is hashed and the key maps to a Dependency object which within it has a list of the dependent objects. So codeSELECT  FROM personcode might return a Dependency object from APC which maps to Person.101 and Person.102 the resulting collection is built from this Dependency object. This works fine for the update of a single object. So If I update Person.101 and put the newly update object into APC overwriting the stale one, when a older query is run that updated object will get put into that result set, which could be incorrect. I need a way to clean not only the object from memory but all the Dependency object which hold a reference to the updated object. In APC is there a way to search for keys containing or values containing or filter keys and valuesp

So an example json response might look likep  precode   id 67,   html lta hrefprofile.phpid61gtWho is number 67ltagt  codepre  pStill not ideal, I dont think.

Negative 32884 pI have a hrefhttpsgithub.comcyclecomputingcondoragent relnofollowa pythonbased daemon that provides a RESTlike interface over HTTP to some command line toolsa. The general nature of the tool is to take in a request, perform some commandline action, store a pickled data structure to disk, and return some data to the caller. Theres a secondary thread spawned on daemon startup that looks at that pickled data on disk periodically and does some cleanup based on whats in the data.p  pThis works just fine if the disk where the pickled data resides happens to be local disk on a Linux machine. If you switch to NFSmounted disk the daemon starts life just fine, but over time the NFSmounted share disappears and the daemon can no longer tell where it is on disk with calls like codeos.getcwdcode. Youll start to see it log errors likep  precode20110713 091936,238 INFO Retrieved submit directory techcondorlogssubmit 20110713 091936,239 DEBUG CondorAgent.postsubmit.dosubmit handler.path condorsubmitqueueQ240scheduler 20110713 091936,239 DEBUG CondorAgent.postsubmit.dosubmit submitting from temporary submission directory techcondorlogssubmittmpoF8YXk 20110713 091936,240 ERROR Caught unhandled exception [Errno 2] No such file or directory 20110713 091936,241 INFO submitter   [13Jul2011 091936] POST condorsubmitqueueQ240scheduler HTTP1.1 500  codepre  pThe unhandled exception resolves to the daemon being unable to see the disk any more. Any attempts to figure out the daemons current working directory with codeos.getcwdcode at this point will fail. Even trying to change to the root of the NFS mount codetechcode, will fail. All the while the codelogger.logging.code methods are happily writing out log and debug messages to a log file located on the NFSmounted share at codetechcondorlogslogsCondorAgentLogcode.p  pThe disk is most definitely still available. There are other, Cbased daemons, reading and writing with a much higher rate of frequency on this share at the time that the pythonbased daemon.p  pIve come to an impasse debugging this problem. Since it works on local disk the general structure of the code must be good, right Theres something about NFSmounted shares and my code that are incompatible but I cant tell what it might be.p  pstrongAre there special considerations one must implement when dealing with a longrunning Python daemon that will be reading and writing frequently to an NFSmounted file sharestrongp  hr  pIf anyone wants to see the code the portion that handles the HTTP request and writes the pickled object to disk is in github a hrefhttpsgithub.comcyclecomputingcondoragentblobmasterCondorAgentpostsubmit.py relnofollowherea.

Negative 32884 pI am currently attempting or planning to attempt to write a simple as possible program to parse an html document into a tree.p  pAfter googling I have found many answers saying dont do it its been done or words to that effect and references to examples of HTML parsers and also a rather emphatic article on why one shouldnt use Regular expresions. However I havent found any guides on the right way to write a parser. This, by the way, is something Im attempting more as a learning exersise than anything so Id quite like to do it rather than use a premade onep  pI believe I could make a working XML parser just by reading the document and adding the tagstext etc. to the tree, stepping up a level whenever I hit a close tag again, simple, no fancy threading or efficiency required at this stage.. However, for HTML not all tags are closed.p  pSo my question is this what would you recommend as a way of dealing with this The only idea Ive had is to treat it in a similar way as the XML but have a list of tags that arent necessarily closed each with conditions for closure e.g. ltpgt ends on ltpgt or next ltpgt tag.p  pHas anyone any other hopefully better suggestions Is there a better way of doing this altogetherp

The way I read it is that the  system continuously readjusts heap size until it eventually reaches heap max. Then, we request an especially large allocation that fails. Clearly there is more than enough memory available about 15 megs. Does this mean that heap is internally fragmented and there are no contiguous memory segments large enough to handle our allocation If thats the case what should I do If thats not it, then whatp  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 32884 pWe have a flash game being developed in actionscript 3 and it runs much more slowly on our remote server.p  pThe game specsp  ul li68 different movie clips, all 1 frame static png files from 10x10 to 100x100li lianywhere from 10 to 60 instances of those MCs on screen at any given timeli lievent loop is run from a flash Timer at 25msli liall interaction is via the keyboardli ul  pThe strange thing is, we publish the swf file and run it locally and everything is fast. We copy the swf to a remote server and everything runs much more slowly. The music plays at normal speed, but the movieclips all move around the screen at about half speed.p  pWhy would the file run differently when fetched from a remote server Isnt the swf always being run locally anyway Also, we ran it locally and remotely with the task manager running and it does not seem to consume much CPU or memory.p  pEDIT Ok, this is really weird. I added a framecounter textfield to the game. It reports the number of ms since the last timer tick. It consistently reports 50ms. My timer is clearly set to 25. This explains the half speed, but what explains this I also added a check on the timer.Interval property to see if it had changed and it hasnt its still set to 25 while the game is running.p  pDOUBLE EDIT I found this article a hrefhttpwww.bit101.comblogp910 relnofollowhttpwww.bit101.comblogp910a, and switched my code to use ENTERFRAME instead of timer, and it works. I get the full 40fps, give or take a few . Still not sure whats wrong with the timer though if it was being delayed by the time spent in my loop it would fluctuate, but it doesnt. Its 50ms every time no matter how much is going on.p  pHeres the code Im usingmore or lessp  precodet  new Timer25 t.addEventListenerTimerEvent.TIMER, timerTick t.start codepre  pand in the timer tick code Im using getTimer to clock the time between ticks. Comes out to 50ms every time.p

Negative 32884 pOk guys, as requested, I will add more info so that you understand why a simple vector operation is not possible. Its not easy to explain in few words but lets see. I have a huge amount of points over a 2D space.  I divide my space in a grid with a given resolution,say, 100m. The main loop that I am not sure if its mandatory or not any alternative is welcomed is to go through EACH cellpixel that contains at least 2 points right now I am using the method quadratcount within the package spatstat.  Inside this loop, thus for each one of this non empty cells, I have to find and keep only a maximum of 10 MaleFemale pairs that are within 3 meters from each other. The 3meter buffer can be done using the disc function within spatstat. To select points falling inside a buffer you can use the method pnt.in.poly within the SDMTools package. All that because pixels have a maximum capacity that cannot be exceeded. Since in each cell there can be hundreds or thousands of points I am trying to find a smart way to use another loopsimilar method to 1go trough each point at a time 2create a buffer a select points with different sex 3Save the closest MaleFemale 01 pair in another dataframe called newcolonies 4Remove those points from the dataframe so that it shrinks and I dont have to consider them anymore 5 as soon as that new dataframe reaches 10 rows stop everything and go to the next cell thus skipping all remaining points. Here is the code that I developed to be run within each cell right now it takes too longp  pheaddf,20p  precode X       Y Sex ID 2  583058.2 2882774   1  1 3  582915.6 2883378   0  2 4  582592.8 2883297   1  3 5  582793.0 2883410   1  4 6  582925.7 2883397   1  5 7  582934.2 2883277   0  6 8  582874.7 2883336   0  7 9  583135.9 2882773   1  8 10 582955.5 2883306   1  9 11 583090.2 2883331   0 10 12 582855.3 2883358   1 11 13 582908.9 2883035   1 12 14 582608.8 2883715   0 13 15 582946.7 2883488   1 14 16 582749.8 2883062   0 15 17 582906.4 2883317   0 16 18 582598.9 2883390   0 17 19 582890.2 2883413   0 18 20 582752.8 2883361   0 19 21 582953.1 2883230   1 20 codepre  pInside each cell I must run something according to what I explained above..p  pcodefori in 1dimdf[1]codep  precodenewcolonies lt data.frameID10,ID20,X0,Y0   discbuff lt discradius, centrecdfX[i], dfY[i]   define the points and polygon pnts  cbinddfX[i],dfY[i] polypnts  cbindx  discbuffbdry[[1]]x, y  discbuffbdry[[1]]y out  pnt.in.polypnts,polypnts outID lt dfID[i]  if anyoutpip  1   pnt.inBuffID lt outID[whichoutpip  1]  cond lt dfSex[i]  dfSex[pnt.inBuffID]  if anycond  eucdist lt sqrtdfX[i]  dfX[pnt.inBuffID][cond]2  dfY[i]  dfY[pnt.inBuffID][cond]2  IDvect lt pnt.inBuffID[cond] newcoloniestemp lt data.frameID1dfID[i], ID2IDvect[whicheucdistmineucdist],                   XdfX[i]  dfX[pnt.inBuffID][cond][whicheucdistmineucdist]  2,                   YdfY[i]  dfY[pnt.inBuffID][cond][whicheucdistmineucdist]  2  newcolonies lt rbindnewcolonies,newcoloniestemp  if dimnewcolonies[1]  maxdensity break      newcolonies lt newcolonies[1,] codepre  pAny help appreciated Thanks Francescop
Negative 32884 pIn Xcode, I want to set the project bundle version to the git hash, to create a unique link between a revision and a build.p  pI have seen several postings about this that increase the build number for each build, but to me this seems excessive, and I would like to have a build number that testers can refer to when sender feedback.p  pI added the following as a Run Script in Build Phasesp  precodeusrlibexecPlistBuddy c Set CFBundleVersion git revparse short HEAD .plist codepre  pAnd then I read out the bundle version in the code withp  precode[[[NSBundle mainBundle] infoDictionary] objectForKeyCFBundleVersion] codepre  pHowever, then the new revision number does not appear in the code until the emnextem build. I assume this is because the plist file is already read by the compiler when my script is run.p  pAlso, since the plist is changed with the revision string emafterem committing to git, this causes an annoying diff in the project, so maybe I am not so smart after all.p  pAn alternative would be to write the revision number to a text file build.txt which is ignored by git. But I would still like the project build number to follow git as well.p  pAnyone know a brilliant way to do thisp

Two sessions holds one lock on the whole table at the same time. I thought that a usual deadlock is when two ore more sessions hold locks on different resources and wait for each other. But here the lock is on the same resource. It is not a lock on an index but on the table. This error is frequent in our application and some lock has to be the first one to be requested and why is the second lock accepted if there already is a lock on the entire tablep  pAnyone who can give a hint of what can be wrong or anyone experienced a similar deadlockp

More specifically, has anyone ever run into issues with local vs. production environments in regards to memcache Any suggestions Ive thought about removing memcache from the app on Heroku, then uninstalling it on my computer and then redoing everything. p  pI know Im being fairly vague here but Im not exactly sure what code to post that would help.p  pThank you for any help.p
Negative 32884 pIve been creating a RESTful application and am undecided over how I should handle requests that dont return all entities of a resource or return multiple resources a codeGET resourceallcode request. Please allow me a few moments to setup the situation Ill try to generalize this as much as possible so it can apply to others besides mep  pLets say Im creating a product API. For simplicity, lets say it returns JSON after the proper accept headers are sent. Products can be accessed at codeproduct[id]code. Products have reviews which can be accessed at codeproducts[id]review[id]code.p  pMy first question lies in this subresource pattern. Since you may not always want the reviews when you GET a product, they are accessible by another URI. From what I read I should include the URI of the request that will return all review URIs for a product in the response for a product request. How should I go about this so that it abides to RESTful standards Should it be a header like codeReviewsURI product123reviewallcode or should I include the URL in the response body like sop  precode name Shamwow,   price 14.99,   reviews product123reviewall  codepre  pMy second question is about how the codeproduct[id]reviewallcode request should function. Ive heard that I should just send the URLs of all of the reviews and make the user GET each of them instead of packaging all of them into one request. How should I indicate this array of review URIs according to RESTful standards Should I use a header or list the URIs in the response body like sop  precode reviews [ product123review1,                product123review2,                product123review3              ]  codepre

Negative 32884 pI want to write a method that when supplied an array of ints will do the following. For each pair of array elements it will combine them and put them into a list of an inner class objects. Then it will compare each element in the array and check if it will fit between each pair values. i.e. I have an array 0, 2, 4 it will make for example pair 0,4 and then it will check that value 2 is indeed between 0 and 4 and so for pair 4,0.  When pair 0, 2 is evaluated it wont find anything and therefore counter will increase and so for pair 2, 0.   I have constructed the following code to evaluate number of values that indeed will fit in pairs and I hoped then to get the total number of pairs that match my need by extracting it from the total number of pairs.  Now I want to optimize this query in case I have very big arrays with thousands of members and very big or negative integers e.g. 1,000,000,000 or  2,000,000,000.  Please let me know how to do that.

Negative 32884 pI am not some one who has done alot in javascript. My background is in JavaC.

When I concatenate them the console will produce undefined. However if I then proceed to use an if statement and compare each of them to undefined. The only if that executes is the first one. p  pThis occurs even though when put to a console the value just shows up blank. Also     the concatenation which shows up as undefined in the console fails its compare against undefined and never executes.  I am confused by this and I am hoping out there some one can give me an explanation about what is going on.p
Negative 32884 pI am very new to Makefiles, so I am probably not doing this the best way your input is much appreciated, since I would like to learn howwhy mine is bad.  Anyway, here is my problemp  pI have a Daemon that I wrote for a program of mine and I am trying to install it with the Makefile target is install. What the install target is supposed to do is move the daemon binary to a location, then move the service script to either etcinit.d or etcrc.d since different distros have different folders....  Here is my makefile so farp  precodeall         echo Making Components         cd Daemon make         echo Components Built install         echo Installing Components         mkdir p usrlib         cp Daemonmyprogd usrlibmyprogd         test d etcinit.d ampamp cp Scriptsmyprog etcinit.d         test d etcrc.d ampamp cp Scriptsmyprog etcrc.d         test  d etcinit.d a  d etcrc.d ampamp echo   Warning Couldnt install script.

Unfortunately, that results in the make install output beingp  precodeInstalling Components make [install] Error 1 ignored make [install] Error 1 ignored Installed. codepre  pWhich is very ugly and probably not good practice.  What can I do in this case  I have tried both  and , but  will not suppress the ignored outputp  pSincerely, Chrisp

Negative 32884 pIm trying to use OCMock for the first time in my test cases. Its a Mac project, built on and targeting Lion, in Xcode 4.3. The main app and the test bundle both have ARC turned on, and so every time I execute the tests I see the following log messagep  pcode GC forcing GC OFF because OBJCDISABLEGC is set codep  pThats fine, as Im using ARC so I dont care about GC. When I build my unit tests, linked against the latest stable release of OCMock 2.0.1, the build has no issues. At runtime, after the above log statement, I get the followingp  pcode The test bundle at UsersLibraryDeveloperXcodeDerivedDataayizwpehemunvodsdvczckkvarshBuildProductsDebugTests.octest could not be loaded because its ObjectiveC runtime information does not match the runtime information required by the test rig.  This is likely because the test rig is being run with ObjectiveC garbage collection disabled, but the test bundle requires ObjectiveC garbage collection.  To enable ObjectiveC garbage collection for the test rig, run it in an environment without the OBJCDISABLEGC environment variable. 20120306 102932.812 otest[8486203]  NSTask Task create for path UsersLibraryDeveloperXcodeDerivedDataayizwpehemunvodsdvczckkvarshBuildProductsDebugTests.octestContentsMacOSTests failed 22, Invalid argument.  Terminating temporary process. codep  pThe message implies that garbage collection is the most common culprit, but as mentioned, there is no way Im using GC. So, what other settings could be messing me up at runtime I didnt think Im doing anything atypical, and Ive looked through my test projects settings to be sure, and didnt see anything weird.p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pI was able to reproduce this with a new empty project.p  ol liCreate a new project and have it create unit tests, with ARC enabledli liClear the codeTest Hostcode setting from the unit test bundles build settingsli liLink to the OCMock frameworkli liExecute the tests, and witness the same error I reported aboveli ol  pAlso, when I turn off ARC and make garbage collection strongRequiredstrong, then codeclangcode reports a macho linker error, so the build doesnt succeed. If I remove the link to the OCMock framework, it builds fine. This supports my initial thought that the problem lies somewhere other than garbage collection.p

Heres what I came up withp  precodethis.parent.prevAll.childrenh2.first.html codepre  pI simply assigned this to a variable and used it to create a new continue title on the next row.p  pAny suggestions for cleaner code Can this be done easier or more efficientlyp  pEDITp  pHeres the HTML as requestedp  precodeltdiv classcontainergt     ltdiv classsubboxgt         lth2gtTitle1lth2gt         ltdiv classitemboxgt...some content here...ltdivgt     ltdivgt     ltdiv classsubboxgtltdiv classitemboxgt...some content here...ltdivgtltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pAs you can see, its simply a set of subboxes with the first one in the set having an H2, but in my case I was working with 4 sets and needed to get the title of the first item in the set not necessarily the title of the first set.p

Negative 32884 pThe TypeWatch jQuery plugin was recommended in several older posts, but Im having trouble using it version 2.0.  I think the problem is my understanding of whats available to the callback when TypeWatch calls it and how to obtain data for the selected form element.p  pAll of the examples Ive been able to find in the past few hours use a simple alert as the callback function, but what I need are the selected form input tags value, alt tag, and title tag.  Would someone please explain to me or provide an example of how this is supposed to work  Maybe if I knew what the this object is, I could answer my own questions.p  pI have a jQuery keyup handler working with AJAX  what I want to do now is incorporate the TypeWatch functionality to prevent server calls with each keystroke.p  pThanks.p

Negative 32884 pIm having an issue where Im preaty not sure how to resolve this and I want to know what is the best approach I should consider in order to achieve this task. p  pWe are developping an application VB.net 2.0 and SQL 2005. Users are allowed to cancel a reception based on a purchase which may contains many received goods. But, during the process of cancellation, some questions are asked to users such as Do you want to cancel Good 1. If yes, delete. Then, Do you want to cancel Good 2, no, do not delete and one another question if received item is issued, a process must be made manualy by the user. And, at the end, if all goods were strongsuccessfullystrong cancelled, we have to cancel the reception itself. But sometime, if an error occurs or some conditions occurs once asked to user in this process, we want to cancel any actions made from the beginning and make it back to his original state. So I thought about codeTransactioncode.p  ol lipI know there is a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comfrfrlibraryms188929.aspx relnofollowTransaction for SQLa which can be used and I know good enough how to use it, but I cant realy use this as user must perform actions which possibly cancel this transaction.pli lipI also remembered a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comfrfrlibrarysystem.transactions.transactionscope28vvs.8029.aspx relnofollowTransactionScopea from .NET 2.X and over which can achieve something similar and I also know as well how to use it.

I assume this is because of QList encapsulating a pointer type and indexOf comparing the pointers. Is there a way of keeping ponters in the QList and still using my own operatorp  pLike codeVertexoperatorVertex othercodep  pRelated Questions a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq75390841387061removing in pointer type Qlistsa  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq89246061387061not working because of pointer typeap  pstrongEditstrong Intention.p  pTwo vertices are considered equal iff. identifiers carried by their payload are equal.p  pcodeVertexcode is part of a codeGraphcode class. I want clients of that class to be able to call codeGraphaddEdgePayload,Payloadcode to populate the graph. Graph objects then take care of wrapping up Payloads in Vertex objects and building Edges. Hence Graph needs to check if a Vertex encapsulating a given payload doesnt already exist. Using QList seemed like the simplest thing that might work at the time of writing the code.p

Negative 32884 pI would like to know if Eclipse JDT is offering any API functions to instantiate an object from an codeITypecode.p  pWe are using the Eclipse JDT search engine to retrieve classes with a particular interface, say codeApplicationcode that looks like thisp  precodepublic interface Application      void launch  codepre  pUsing the JDT search engine, we are able to get an codeITypecode object that represents a class that implements the codeApplicationcode interface.

So, I would like to know if the JDT offers any API functions to do so.p  pIf it does, we will use it to instantiate the codeITypecode.

Negative 32884 pNot quite sure how to word the title better.p  pWhat i need to do, is call a method with calluserfunc.

It accepts params along with class and method name. Its all stored in a database, and when it runs, i need to be able to send the params to the method as intended.p  pI cant rewrite how methods accept variables, because that would be way too much work. Im going to be calling several 10 methods from the cronjob, all of which are pretty well used in the application. Im also not sure how i would rewrite it, but if you have any suggestions about that, let me know.p  pAlso, im using codeigniter if that matters.

Negative 32884 pI have a WCF service INTWCF that consumes another WCF service EXTWCF. EXTWCF exposes 5 operations, will be hosted on an external app server in a DMZ, and implements message and transport level security.p  pINTWCF will be hosted on an internal app server, does not implement any security, hosts two individual services with approx 30 operations  a number of which are called by the operations on EXTWCF along with various other domain level applications, depending on various parameters passed in EXTWCF contains simple logic to determine which operations on INTWCF should be called.p  pEXTWCF implements INTWCF using IoC and DI.p  pUsing TDD, I would like to write my initial emunitem tests for the operations exposed on EXTWCF. I would therefore like to mock up INTWCF using Moq. I would have thought that I should mock up and inject INTWCF in to the unit testing project, but Ive read in quite a few places that IoC and DI should not be used during unit testing due to the additional testing dependencies they introduce.p  pAm I being fed incorrect information, or is there another way to approach this problem Is mocking appropriate for this situation Seeing as though my unit tests will be accessing the operations on EXTWCF, they will not know about INTWCF. This seems to me to be a perfect case for DIp  pIm using Ninject for IoC and DI if DI is the answer, does Ninject provide a bootstrapper  plugins for unit testing Im not familiar with any, and dont see anything on their web pagep

Negative 32884 pI would like to use codepredict.lmcode to generate fitted values for the predictors in a model.  In other words, I want to multiply the coefficient estimates in an codelmcode object by the values in a new data frame with emnem rows.  The result is a matrix with emnem rows in which each value has been multiplied by its corresponding coefficient.  p  pThis is easy to do when the new data frame has a column for each of the coefficient estimates in the codelmcode object.  For examplep  precodey       lt rnorm6  x1      lt rnorm6 x2      lt rnorm6  modEasy lt lmy  x1  x2 dfEasy  lt data.framex1  rnorm6, x2  rnorm6 predictmodEasy, newdata  dfEasy, type  terms codepre  pBut it is tricky to generate fitted values when the model includes a factor variable or a polynomial.

But codedfHardcode has only two columns one for codex1code and one for codex2code.  As a result, codepredictcode returns a matrix with only two columns one for codex1code and the other for codex2code.  p  pIn this situation, I want predict to return a matrix with columns for codex1code and for each level of codex2code.  I can produce that matrix with this codep  precodemf lt model.frameformulamodHard, dfHard mm lt model.matrixformulamodHard, mf tmodHardcoefficients  tmm codepre  pBut is there a simpler wayp
Negative 32884 pMy class contains code14 private methodscode and code1 public methodcode. The public method calls all the private method directly or indirectly via other private methods. p  pThe public method also has a call to  a codeDAOcode that queries the database.  I wrote a unit test for the class. Since you cant write unit test for private methods, I changed all the private methods to default access and wrote unit test for them. p  pI was told that I shouldnt change the encapsulation just for the purpose of testing. But my public method has a call to the DAO and gets its data from the call. Even if I were to write a test for the public method, Im assuming it would be really long and complicated. p  pHow should I approach this problem. On one hand, I have to write a really complicated test for the public method which accesses a DAO and on the other hand, change the access level of the methods and write short, simple test methods for them.

noted that I am using the javax.net.ssl library and not the apache one.p  pEDIT The python server is hosted on a Windows machine. Is there any extra configuration that needs to be taken into account for ssl on a Windows portp  pEDIT Yes, there is something that needs to be done to allow SSL on a windows port. Switched to port 443 designated for SSL traffic and am making slow progress. p  pEDIT I am now able to track the request using Wireshark I am learning a lot for this problem and Wireshark is telling me that there is a 405 error. Which in SSL means that the certificate format is not recognized. The python server is using PEM certificates the only format allowed according to python docs and the certificates imported into the keystore on the Android device are DER to my knowledge the only format accepted by BKS.p  pAny help would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 32884 pis it possible to override the File property of an appender that has been configured in the codelog4j.propertiescode without creating a new appender And if so  howp  pThis is the situation I have two apenders, A1 is a ConsoleAppender and A2 is a FileAppender. A2s File points a generic error.logp  pcodelog4j.appender.A2.Fileerror.csvcodep  pThis appender only logs errorlevel events or worse throughp  pcodelog4j.appender.A2.Thresholderrorcode.p  pNow I want those errors to be written in different files depending on which class caused the error, as there are several classes that instances are being created of. Being able to see which class created the errors fast would be of great help, as it is a lot more helpful then skimming through the error.log looking for the classtags.p  pSo my idea was to override the File property e.g. in the constructors of these newly created classes, so they log errors in different files.p  pThanks a lot in advancep

Negative 32884 pI am developing an app for all the available screen resolutions. My approach is to create different codedrawablecode folders and to keep respective images in them. Everything was going fine before I found a clash between two devices of different resolutions. Devices are of code480800code and code6001024code resolution. But according to their pixel density they are accessing same codedrawablecode folder codedrawablehdpicodewhich is also according to given specification in this image below.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comlg0R1.png altp  pMy problem is that images in this folder are perfect for one device and not for other.

Please help me on how can I handle this situation. Hope I have described my situation clearly...p

Negative 32884 pI have a rather complex solution which I implemented using ASP Web API, among others. I have 3 projects in my solution worth mentinoing right now. One is a WebAPI containing only api methods. Other two are are the backend and frontend for my application. The backend uses a SPA approach loading mostly empty shells for views and filling everything with ajax acessing the API. The frontend on the other hand because of SEO concerns was decided to be implemented by more traditional means, aka most stuff is rendered server side. My question is, is it possible and good practice to simply call the web api methods from the frontend controlllers and send the results to the view I dont see a point in duplicating most code in the regular controllers since its all done with the api.p  pAny samples on this Ive been searching but couldnt find much.p

However, there doesnt appear to be a way to retrieve tags for an application, and no matter what I try for a page, the tags connection is always empty but does return data for my test user account.p  pIs there any way to do this Even with the codereadstreamcode permission, I can only see the posts made by my user, but I dont see the comments left on their friendss pages. p

We have actually planted this chip on a custom PCB and are inthe process of writting more firmware. p  pCurrently, I need to tell the ADC on the Micro Controller UnitMCU to sample at 8k samples  second. In reality this is for sampling a microphone. Either way, the documentation is quite unclear and I was looking for some clarification. p  pI know that to change the sampling rate i need to change what is called the Mode Register, the register used to configure the ADC for use pg 799 in the link above.

Because x is limited to 8 bits as i said before this would appear to be impossible, because the max is 255. p  pI feel that I am doing something wrong here, or not understanding what the datasheet wants me to.

Negative 32884 pMy goal is to parallelize a computation using codeparMapcode from the a hrefhttphackage.haskell.orgpackageparallelparallel packagea, but Id also like to add a bit of randomness to my sampling function.p  pWithout the randomness my calculation is simply some number crunching and so its pure and I could use codeparMapcode. In order to get good results, I need to take multiple samples at each step and average the results. The sampling needs to be randomized.p  pOne solution might be to use the a hrefhttphackage.haskell.orgpackagerandomrandom packagea, call coderandomscode and then consume that list during the computation by passing the pure lazy list to the computation I would keep it pure. Unfortunately, thats a very slow random number generator and I need a lot of random numbers so I would prefer to use either a hrefhttphackage.haskell.orgpackagemwcrandommwcrandoma or a hrefhttphackage.haskell.orgpackagemersennerandommersennerandoma although, I dont think mersennerandom is still maintained.p  pIs it safe to use something like codeunsafePerformIOcode with mwcrandom to write a function like coderandomscode Something like thisp  precoderandomsMWC  Variate a gt GenST s gt [a] randomsMWC g  unsafePerformIO  unsafeSTToIO  randomsMWC g   where   randomsMWC g  do     a  lt uniform g     as lt unsafeInterleaveST  randomsMWC g     return a  as codepre  pDo I need to instead reach for a a hrefhttpwww.drdobbs.comtoolsfasthighqualityparallelrandomnumber229625477parallel number generatora Or do I need to bite the bullet and admit that my algorithm is simply not pure without using the slow random packagep  pSuggestions Thanksp

Negative 32884 pIm looking for a standalone serverside solution to recognize search engine crawlers and other bots from human interactive visitors. I expect a codeUserAgentcodeanalysisbased algorithm. The component would be used to classify requests whether coming from a bot or a human visitor in an ASP.NET MVC web site.

This behavior is unwanted when a search crawler visits our site, which needs to see the site as is without being redirected. p  pSo far I just found lists of bots codeUserAgentcode strings such as a hrefhttpwww.robotstxt.orgdb.html relnofollowthisa or a hrefhttpwww.useragentstring.compagesuseragentstring.php relnofollowthisa. However, while its a simple task, instead of making our own component, Id prefer using a 3rd party one to avoid taking care of updates which would require regular research.p  pRequirements for a componentp  ul lipure .NET componentli lino regular external calls made to outer services to preserve low request processing latencyli liupdate service for the component  its configurationli ul  pAlternative a web service accepting codeUserAgentcode strings to be examined.

The query string has both a R which is meant as a wildcard for SQL to interpret, but also a s which is meant to place a variable in python between single quotes.  It looks like thisp  precodedef numcustmatter     QryString       select countdistinct userid     from dbo.tblcasedetails     where request like r     and projectid in                  select distinct projectid         from dbo.tblprojects         where matternumber  s                matter     cursor.executeQryString     row  cursor.fetchone     return row[0] codepre  pHow can I escape the wildcards for r so that I can successfully pass it through to SQLp  pThank you kindly.p

Negative 32884 pSo I have a simple program where I want to shift a simple sine function pi2. Now I knwo this would be extremely easy by just inserting a bias i.e. Asin2pifrequency  bias. But this program is a simple way to test a theory. I need to shift complicated magnetic data, but the shift is frequency dependent. So to figure out how to do that I just want to shift this sin wave by a set shift, but I want to do it in the frequency domain.

Negative 32884 pWe are having issues with our clients being unregistered randomly, typically 1 hour after registration occurs but has been up to 3 or 4 hours. We are trying to determine when the unregistration is happening so we can identify the bug.p  pSo I am aware that the unregistration process for GCM generally takes about 1 hour. That being said, is it unheard of for unregistration to take stronglonger than 1 hourstrong.p  pThis is fairly important because if it always takes somewhere in the range of 5070 minutes as I have typically seen, then it means unregistration is occuring immediately for our clients.

Negative 32884 pIve noticed that when working with Javas BigInteger class, elementary arithmetic operations seem to be way less efficient than their primitive counterparts, even when the same numbers and operations are used.

I have done a quick research and found out that it is specific to GNU compilers. I have to use this legacy code in Visual Studio 2010 using MSVC10 compiler and apparently it is complaining everywhere it sees strongattributestrongunused even though it is protected by codeifndefcode and codeifdefcodes. An example isp  precodeifdef tonez   static const char mcrinf else   static char mcrinf endif ifndef WINDOWS attribute unused      this is causing all the problem endif   bla bla copyright bla    ifdef tonez    static const char mcrinfo2a353id[2] else    static       char mcrinfo2a353id[2] endif attribute unused    my long copyright info   codepre  pI am really struggling to understand if it is very poorly planned code or is it just my misunderstanding. How do I avoid the usual compiler and linker errors with this codeattributecode directive I have started to get C2061 errors missing identifiersunknown. I have got all necessary header files and nothing is missing, may be except GNU compiler which I dont want.p  pAlso, it seems that the end of line character codecode is also being messed up when I take to code in windows....argh....I mean the UNIX endofline and Windows EOL how can I use this code without modifying the body....I can define in my property sheet about the WINDOWS thingy, but cannot automatically adjust the EOL character recognition.p  pANy help is appreciated Thanks.p

Negative 32884 pIve got a codeUIWebViewcode that is using way too much memory.  The behavior in question involves an HTMLJavaScript page where you can recolor certain areas by tapping them, creating new color layers based on PNG files, but every time the user touches the field whether theyre adding color or recoloring an existing area the memory ticks up.  Every touch eats up memory, and it never drops.  This process continues emad infinitumem, resulting in memory loss at best and an app crash at worst.p  pAfter playing around with Activity Monitor and Instruments, Ive narrowed it down to a buildup of objects in the codeVM Webkit malloccode category, from the codeJavaScriptCore librarycode.  That makes sense the pages functionality is JavaScript, and each PNG layer is about 4KB, the same size as the objects that are building up.p  pSo now my question becomes, strongwhat do I do about itstrongp  pIm kind of new to codeUIWebViewcode, so I was wondering if someone could shed some light on my options  Is there a way to manually clear out all those unnecessary objects I tried code[[NSURLCache sharedURLcache] removeAllCachedResponses]code but it did nothing, or prevent them from forming in the first placep  pAnd perhaps most importantly strongis this likely to end up being an iOS solution in the app, or a JavaScript solution on the pagestrongp

Negative 32884 pi am confused by working of my own query after changing it, i am using several tables join to calculate total overtime of an employee based on his Intime and TimeOut.

For 2nd shiftS002 Overtime is after 1800. So what i did is that i picked ShiftIDs from shift table, and inner joined it with Employee table, Shift table has only 3 shift id, s001, s002, s003. In Employees table all employees have been assigned s001, s002 only.p  pConfusion Now when i pass ShiftID hardcoded like S001 or S002 then it works and even if i pass it like this  WHEN SHIFTID  SHIFTID thne it works too, QUESTION is that how does it understand that for which shiftID it is asking in comaprison, both are SHIFTID with equal sign, HOW does it know that whether it is s001 or s002.

Negative 32884 pI have a form, this form has a panel. When the form codeOnShowncode fires, I start a background worker to execute a long running code method a set number of times. In this background worker, I add a  codeUser Controlcode to the panel onebyoneperiteration while displaying a  Wait picture on the UI thread.p  pstrongProblemstrong My long running code runs faster than the panel can draw the controls Ive added to it. Basically, when my form loads, it takes about 1.5 seconds to run the code I can tell by how fast the wait picture hides itself, however, the child controls on the panel take between 4 and 6 seconds to draw themselves...p  pAs you can imagine this would cause some major confusion to the user in that the Wait image would hidethe code would be done, but the controls wouldnt be shown for another 4 seconds.p  pSo, is there a way to essentially Wait until all the child controls on the panel are drawn, so that i can ONLY THEN hide the Wait picture through some mechanism in the Panel controlp  pIf thats not possible, keep in mind that  Im using a  codeUser Controlcode and have access to those events as well.

Negative 32884 pIve searched high and low for the answer to this, but alas, Im here. As I know that codeNSDateFormattercode objects are costly to create, I dont want to instantiate one for every codeNSTextFieldcode inside of my table. The problem Im facing is that my table is viewbased as opposed to cellbased, and when attempting to connect a shared instance of a date formatter, I get the yellow warning symbol and this messagep  blockquote   pUnsupported Configuration Outlet formatter of Text Field Cell    Table View Cell is connected to Date Formatter, an invalid   destination Objects inside view based table views may only be   connected to the table views delegate.p blockquote  pThe problem with that warning is this the above referenced Date Formatter is a property of Files Owner, which also happens to be the codeNSTableViewcodes delegate. Am I missing something here, or am I going to have to create formatters for every daterelated text field in my tablep

Negative 32884 pIve been developing for some time now...every now and then I find out about more HTML tags, PHP functions etc that I never new I had at my disposal.p  pToday, Im talking about the different HTML input types....well, only one and then some linkrel values...p  pInput type searchp  pI have looked in several places and all I get is the obvious answer of what its purpose is. I can do fulltext queries just fine by making the field a text type...p  pso whats the technical difference between the text and search input types and are there any benefits of using making the input field a search typep  pAnd, I have similar misunderstandings with some of the rel values of the link tagp  pNext, prev, search etc...p  pI can do the same things without using those rels...I can create a slideshow of articles without using nextprev. search, i dont understand at all... I can only find the defeintion of it..Links to a search tool for the document...does this mean a tool like that which google provides so your users can search through a documentp  pI can do these things without using s altogether so Im guessing the answer to my question is in the fact that I dont use  for these tasks and maybe I should Combine then with AJAXp  pThanksp

Negative 32884 pIve seen in some Microsoft WP apps where they display text in the system tray along with the time, and then when the user taps the system tray the text disappears and the normal system tray data signal, power, etc comes down and is displayed. An example of this would be the bing weather app on WP8. Id like to be able to implement the same feature in an app I am creating, where the user always sees some sort of system tray data, such as time with the name of the app, or the full system tray display that can normally be viewed. Is this possible for developers or is this some sort of thing only Microsoft has the ability to do To note, I do not mean displaying text while a progress bar is shown.p

Negative 32884 pI created a DocBook manual with an adapted docbkxmavenplugin in PDF and WebHelp format. The plugin gets the DocBook XSLT templates through a Maven dependency.

Now, I want to use profiling. To do so, I think I need to include the xhtmlprofilechunk.xsl template instead of xhtmlchunk.xsl.

Unfortunately, I get errors when I try to import xhtmlprofilechunk.xsl in my customization file which seems due to the fact that all imports are resolved in the context of webhelp.

Negative 32884 pSo I was writing a program, and one of the functions is to determine whether the character is a vowel or not. The program is as followsp  precodebool isvowelstring s      if s  A  s  a return true     if s  E  s  e return true     if s  I  s  i return true     if s  O  s  o return true     if s  U  s  u return true     if s  Y  s  y return true      return false  codepre  pSo my question comes out when I tried to turn the string s into a reference parameter stringamp s. After the change, whenever I tried to call this function the program Im using Xcode on Mac btw tells me codeNo matching function for call to isvowelcode, even when the object inside IS a string object. So why cant I use a reference parameter here Isnt the s referred to whichever string I use to call this function I used reference parameters for most of the functions in which Im not changing anything because I think referring instead of copying the value into a new parameter may be more efficient. So why it wont work here BTW, is it true that referring instead of copying the value into a new parameter is more efficientp  pEdit per the request of many, Ill just add one other function that calls this one and for the purpose of simplicity, Ive cut off a big chunk of the code. So dont dwell on logic of this part too much.p  precodeint FRISyllablesvectorltstringgtamp s      int syllables  0      for int i  0 i lt s.size i              string word  s[i]          for int n  0 n lt word.length n                      if isvowelword.substrn, 1                 syllables  Rule 1 count each vowel as a syllable                    return syllables  codepre  pAnd as for the change to the bool function, everything else is the same, except the first line isp  precodebool isvowelstringamp s codepre  pand the error Xcode gives me is No matching function for call to isvowel.p

Are these default parameters or dummy parameters They seem to be being used, so the parameters need to be taken from somewhere Do they correspond with csvfile and headersp  pMy second problem has to do with the .on function. I looked at the csv documentation, but I couldnt find any commentary on what this does. They seem to only use it.

There is a FK between Permission.UserId  User.Id and Permission.CompanyId  Company.Id.  There is no emexplicitem relationship ie. FK between User.DefaultCompany and the Company table.  This is on purpose due to a legacy choice in our database schema.p  pI also have a database repository method that grabs a user by its Id, and includes the full Company recordp  precodepublic User GetByIdGuid Id      return from r in this.Context.Users.IncludePermissions.Company         where r.Id  Id         select r         .SingleOrDefault  codepre  pThis works fine, but it doesnt set the codeDefaultCompanycode property.

I can do this all as two separate operations, as in the following code, but Id rather not hit the database twice if I dont have to.p  precodepublic User GetByIdGuid Id      var u  from r in this.Context.Users.IncludePermissions.Company             where r.Id  Id             select r             .SingleOrDefault      u.DefaultCompany  from r in this.Context.Companies where r.Id  u.Id select r.SingleOrDefault      return u  codepre  pIs there another way to accomplish thisp  pEdit explaining resulting SQL data model and additional example.p

Negative 32884 pstrongSympthomsstrong I have several XBee 24ZB emseries 2em here, and they are hooked up on a PC as the coordinator and on an end device AVR as a router no sleep.p  pWhen sending data in larger amounts, it could happen that the routerend device XBee suddenly freezes the DIN line. It can still communicate over radio, and it can still transmit received data serially to the microcontroller DOUT but ignores DIN.p  pThe XBee is operated in strongtransparentstrong mode, and it also ignores the AT commands  with guard times, no matter how often you try. I made very sure the waveforms are clean, read the VCC is stable with a filtering capacitor, read the manual and datasheets.p  pstrongThe only solution is to RESET the XBee or power cycle of the XBee device.strongp  pstrongBaudratesstrong I tried 111111 and 250000. Those are perfect matches for the XBee 0 error and for the AVR which is also operating on a 16nbspMHz crystal. During the time the XBee works, it can transmit large amounts of data without a single corruption, and reset of the microcontroller does not change anything.p

Negative 32884 pI use buildroot package to port some software packages to some Linux embedded system. Some software packages also produce plain text script andor library control files with references to staging directories. It is necessary to remove the references to staging directories at the stage of packaging the software for distribution. I have no problem to use SED to remove such references. However, this processing leaves some undesired patterns of duplicate strings and I excerpted as shown below. I would like to know if it is possible to use SED to remove such duplicates.p  pstrongNote1strong emTheem dependencylibs emwas left out and is now amended as shown below. I tried to be succinct to excerpt what is needed here and did not include theem dependencylibs emhere before because it doesnt contain any duplicates. Apparently, it plays an important part on some of suggested solutions below. Therefore, I amended it here for posterity.emp  pstrongNote2strong emI just found out a little bug with theem sed emscripts from potong. If the duplicate strings are the last object sans an empty space, theem sed emscripts fails. In this case, the 1stem dependencylibs emline will partially fail theem sed emscripts.

Negative 32884 pI have three vectors in the plane and I want to check if the third is a positive linear combination of the other two as fast as possible. that is if y  ax  bz, I want to check if both a and b are positive. If x and z are orthogonal I could of course just check the scalar products  and . But in this case they are not.

Negative 32884 pHaving figured out most of my datamodel for a new iOS app, Im now stuck with a problem that Ive been thinking about for a while. p  pAn Experiment has a name, description and owner. It also has one Action and one Event. p  pAn Event could be different things Time, Location or Speed. p  pDepending on what the Event is, it can have a different Type. For example, Time could be oneoff, interval, daterange, repeating or random. Location could be area or exact location.p  pEach Type then has a value that has a data type unique to itself. The Time OneOff could be a date value of 1215pm and the Location Exact could be a GeoPoint value of 30.0, 20.0.p  pstrongThe Problemstrong p  ul liHow do I design the data model so that the database is not riddled with NULL valuesli liHow do I design the data model to be extensible if I add more Events and Types.li ul  pstrongThoughtsstrongp  pAs an Experiment only has one Action and one Event, it would be wrong to separate these two into different tables, however not doing so would cause the Experiment table to be full of NULL values, as Id have to have columns for Event, Event Type and Event Type Value to compensate for all of the possible data types one could enter for an Event Type Value. date, int, string, geopoint, etcp  pSeparating the Event and Event Type into a separate table would probably fix the NULL value issue however Id be left with repeating data, especially in the case of time as the Event with Type OneOff as 1200pm, as this would exist in other experiments, not just one. Unless I create EVERY possibility and populate a separate table with these  how could I easily do this thoughp  pMaybe Im over complicating things, maybe Im missing something so simple that Im going to kick myself when I see it.p

Negative 32884 pI have configured my WSO2 Identity server with a tenant. Then I logged in as tenant admin and configured a Read Write LDAP userstore for that tenant. I also configured a Service Provider against that tenant. p  pThe problem that I am facing is that while I try to login to my service, the user authentication against the tenant LDAP store is not working. I have verified the password using ldap utility and ensured that it is the right password. Also if I login to the Administrative console of WSO2 Identity Server and change the password using the admin console the service provider login will work for sometime. I guess till the next sync. I have also ensured that the password hashing mechanism in optional properties of the tenant user store is same as that in the LDAP user store. Both are set to SHA. p  pIs there anything that I am doing wrong with my configuration If somebody can point me in the right direction it will be great.p  pThanks in advance.p

For example, if users run a price recalculation this process could easily take longer than say the 1 hour timeout. p  pI emailed the developers on the web app and they recommend scheduling some processes to run from the backend so that there would be no need for the user to have an active session.p  pThe timeout will be configured for tomcat by editing the web.xml. p  pIf anyone has any informationguidancedirection on how to accomplish this I would greatly appreciate it. I am new to programming so googling for an answer has been unproductive. This could be due to my lack of technical knowledge or the lack of information on this subject. My guess is the former. p  pThank you p  pEDIT Ok so to clarify a few things. I would be possible for me to figure out what business process would normally be expected to exceed the timeout. With this information I would automatically have these processes run on the backend to avoid a timeout conflict  p
Negative 32884 pI am porting a windows application to iOS platform. In the c code, the wchart is widely used instead of using wchar16t or wchar32t.p  pThe application is coded in such a way in windows assuming the wchart to be 16 bit while it takes 32 bit in iOS platform. There are lot of bit operation so maintaing wchart in 16bit is necessary.p  pI have tried setting the flags fshortwchar to other C flags in project settings, but of no use. Is it need to specify the flag in any other way with some other flags Is there any way to typedef or redefine the wchart to unsigned short or to 16 bit for the iOS platform.p  pAny help will be very much appreciated.p

Now, whenever there is a bug I encounter a weird situation when eclipse opens up the codeDebugcode view instead of logging the errors in codeLogCatcode. It also shows a tab with Intrumentation.class. See attached images below. This is particularly for the device I am debuggin on HTC One. If I use some other device it logs the error normally into codeLogCatcode. I am not sure what brings about this setting but Id like to stick to my device and see the errors in codeLogCatcode. Where can I change these settingsp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comloRbD.png altDebug Viewp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comR0KsS.png altInstrumentation.Classp

Negative 32884 pWhats the best way of creating a large temporary file in Java, and being sure that its on disk, not in RAM somewherep  pIf I usep  precodePath tempFile  Files.createTempFiletempfilename, .tmp codepre  pthen it works fine for small files, but on my Linux machine, it ends up being stored in codetmpcode. On many Linux boxes, thats a tmpfs filesystem, backed by RAM, which will cause trouble if the file is large. The appropriate way of doing this on such a box is to put it in codevartmpcode, but hardcoding that path doesnt seem very crossplatform to me.p  pIs there a good crossplatform way of creating a temporary file in Java and being sure that its backed by disk and not by RAMp

They were never updated because of the list1 amp list2 variable were assigned to different object in the append function, thus when returning from the function, list1 and list2 were taking back on their original reference. But the tail reference is updated  You can see it by running the code, you will see that tail is always the tail of the new merged list, and not the head of the new list. I dont understand why because tail is ALSO referenced to a new object in append, so when returning from the function, tail should still be the head lol thats crazy p  pThank you ...p

Negative 32884 pI would like to implement a lazy property so that it will not have a value until it is accessed for the first time.

Negative 32884 pI have a little question.  Im making a simple board game. The user has the possibility to play against an AI. It works fine. The rules of the games state that if someone throws the dice and make 1 or 4, he can play again. So I made a for loop. It works too. The AI plays as many times as it need then allows P1 to play.

The animations for 4 amp 1 amp 5 all plays at the same time looks weird. Id like a 2 seconds delay between the first throw from AI and the next one so that the animation have time to play out.

This is XCode 5.11 targeting OSX 10.10 desktop.p  pI have inherited some code with a few views where navigating among child controls within the view using the tab key does not work.p  pIn researching this almost everything says to be sure to set the first responder and then chain your controls using nextKeyView.p  pI followed the steps in this video a hrefhttpswww.youtube.comwatchvSRrE8eqp0dU relnofollowhttpswww.youtube.comwatchvSRrE8eqp0dUa XCode 4, but all the functionality seemed to be the same for 5.11 to no avail.p  pI also had a look at this solution a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5013372howtomakechildcontrolsofviewwillgetfocusontabandshifttabinnsviewHow to make child controls of view will get focus on Tab and ShiftTab in NSViewControllera which sounds like a similar issue to what I am seeing, but one of the classes I inherited uses NSWindowController vs. NSViewController as the base and there is no loadView to override and the other which did derive from NSViewController did not behave any differently with the changes made to loadView. p  pWhen my window launches my first responder control NSTextField in this case has focus blue highlight but tab key is ignored and focus will not change unless I use the mouse.p  pSo its really not a tab ordering issue initially, it seems like a tab ignored issue and who knows what the ordering is. I tried setting focus to a NSButtonCell and NSPopUpButton using the mouse and then tab navigate from those to see if there was some issue with my NSTextField but they exhibit the same behavior. None of the controls are set to Refuses First Responder which was another setting it was recommended to check.p  pIm at a loss and looking for any other things to try or check.p  pThe first view I am having an issue with is Window  Child View  Multiple Child Boxes  Multiple controls per box in case that matters or complicates things. It is basically for setting application Preferences.p  pThe second view seems like it may be more complicated in that there is a single Window that swaps out its child view in a nextback progression wizard interface. The initial window nib is blank so I didnt see how to associate a first responder from IB like I did with the Preferences window since all the controls are on their own individual view nibs these all show as Custom View vs. just View for Preferences.p

Negative 32884 pI am writing a program that makes an undirected graph and performs BFS on that graph. This graph uses an adjacency list representation, built ontop of a List struct that I had previously built. Anyways, Im trying to load in the graph from a file then perform BFS on it, but if I perform BFS on a graph loaded from a file with over 30 vertices, I get a segfault during a malloc call. If I, however, dont load the graph from file and instead make it by hand using loops and manually adding verticesedges, I can have thousands of vertices and 10k edges and no segfaults occur at all. This obviously makes me think that something that Im doing while loading in the graph data is corrupting the heap, but the odd thing is that the malloc call that fails isnt in the function that reads from the file, and the function does correctly translate the input file into a graph data structure, so I am lost.

Negative 32884 pThis seems like something that should be so simple, but I cant figure it out this morning.  Ive even had my coffee.  I am returning four fields from a WebFOCUS query  SHIPWEEK, Ship Date, Part Numberand Quantity QTY.  I set up the query so that it pulls 365 days of records when the workbook opens.  I have then summarized the data into a Pivot Table.  The Pivot Table simply shows SHIPWEEK as a row with two VALUES  Count of QTY and Sum of QTY.  This all works fine.  p  pWhat I want beyond this, however, is to calculate for the range of the returned results the average weekly count and standard deviation.  I can do this simply by using the AVERAGE and STDEV functions and pointing to the two VALUES ranges in the Pivot Table.  That will work once.  But Id like to not have to manually adjust the range for these formulas each time I run the query.  Theoretically, there will be the same number of weeks in 365 days of data, but that may not always be the case.  If the number of rows in the Pivot Table changes, then it might skew my results.  p  pSurely there is a way to do this in the Pivot Table itself  Pivot Table offers a Grand Total option, which will sum all of the records, but I dont know how to do the equivalent of Grand Total for average or Standard Deviation.  p  pIf not in the Pivot Table, then dynamically outside of the Pivot Table without requiring manual range updates each time p

Therefore I am wanting the past 5 locations and then an average to be calculated as this would make the hand tracking experience much more smoother.p  pI have been trying to store the previous 5 locations but when I attempted this I only get the latest raw data which then get stored and overwrites it for the locations.p  pThe OnNewFrame method is where I get the raw data.p  pHelp on how I would do this would great.p  precodeusing System using System.Collections.Generic using System.Linq using System.Text using System.Threading.Tasks using System.Threading using SDKAttempt using Microsoft.Xna.Framework using Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Content using Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Graphics using Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Input using System.Drawing The sdk module tracks geometric  nodes for every frame     namespace PercUtils        class DepthPipeline  UtilMPipeline              double screenWidth  GraphicsAdapter.DefaultAdapter.CurrentDisplayMode.Width         double screenHeight  GraphicsAdapter.DefaultAdapter.CurrentDisplayMode.Height         PXCMGesture.GeoNode nData data the we will get from the camera          double xPos  0         double yPos  0         double zPos  0         double handOpeness  0         private bool finished         PXCMGesture.GeoNode[] nodeData  new PXCMGesture.GeoNode[1] data from hand           public DepthPipeline              base                      finished  false             EnableImagePXCMImage.ColorFormat.COLORFORMATDEPTH             EnableGesture This function is called to enable finger tracking and gesture recognition                    public override void OnGestureSetupref PXCMGesture.ProfileInfo pinfo the application can override this function to finetune any parameters during module  initilisation                      base.OnGestureSetupref pinfo                  public override void OnGestureref PXCMGesture.Gesture gesture the application needs to receive posegesture, the application can override the ongesture function                      if gesture.label  PXCMGesture.Gesture.Label.LABELPOSETHUMBUP                              Console.WriteLineThumb Up debug                           base.OnGestureref gesture                  public override void OnAlertref PXCMGesture.Alert alert the application can override the OnAlert function to receive alert notifications                       base.OnAlertref alert                   public override bool OnNewFrame                      double xRatio  screenWidth  160  corrects the ratio of the x axis of the camera to work with the width screen  scales the camera cood for the screen being used             double yRatio  screenHeight  120 corrects the ratio of the y axis of the camera to work with the height screen  scales the camera cood for the screen being used              PXCMGesture gesture  QueryGesture             pxcmStatus sts  gesture.QueryNodeData0, PXCMGesture.GeoNode.Label.LABELBODYHANDLEFT, out nData gets the status of the left hand, out nData because the value isnt set and the function must set it before returning it                if sts gt pxcmStatus.PXCMSTATUSNOERROR                               xPos  screenWidth  nData.positionImage.x  xRatio  screenWidth  2                 yPos  nData.positionImage.y  yRatio  screenHeight  2                 zPos  nData.positionWorld.y  100                 handOpeness  nData.openness                  TitleScreen.setXxPos this corrects the inverted control of the dot                 TitleScreen.setYyPos                 TitleScreen.getHandOpennesshandOpeness                  PlayGame.setXxPos this corrects the inverted control of the dot                 PlayGame.setYyPos                 PlayGame.getHandOpenesshandOpeness                 PlayGame.getZzPos gets the z coordnidate of the users hand.

Negative 32884 pI have been trying to put a draggable annotation on a mapview for ages. Im using the default pin, not my own So far I can only display it at set coordinates not much of an achievement, really and I need to get the annotation first of all to react to being selected, it doesnt ever get received by the didChangeDragState func.

They all had title fields, but none of the answers mentioned that a title field was necessary, which turned out to be the main problem.

Negative 32884 pLast few days, my windows server got hung by svchost.exenetsvcs using high loads of CPU so I suspended the process and CPU usage dramatically declined. So I happily logged out of remote desktop connection. The real problem occurred on the next day I realized that I cannot login to remote desktop anymore stuck in Please wait for policy client and never continue further. Seems like group policy service is a part of svchost process and the fact that I suspended it making the problems occurring. The only way I can access my remote server is through remote desktop connection. So how can I resume that svchost.exe from my local machine or any other ways around Since many important data awaiting on server, I must have access back. Big Thanks.p

Negative 32884 pI have an intention to set a field value of an object like thisp  precode scope[nameOfField]value codepre  pwhich works if nameOfField is just field name.p  pHowever, if I define in scope object subObjectp  precodescope.subObject var nameOfFieldsubObject.someSubField  scope[nameOfField]12345 codepre  pthis does not work. Apparently I can not address directly subobject fields like this. I however do need to use  nameOfField approach with subobject fields, and appreciate hints how to make it work.

Negative 32884 pI have a number of large Oracle tables partitioned by day of year data older than 1 year is deleted to keep each partition to a maximum size. We run a lot of different queries on ranges of time, where these large tables are joined. We have to handle the case where the time range crosses the yearend boundary, causing the beginning day of year to be larger than the ending day of year.p  pWhat weve triedp  precodeWHERE table1.doy IN SELECT columnvalue FROM TABLEdoytbl AND       table1.time BETWEEN time1 AND time2 AND       table2.doy  table1.doy codepre  pwhere doytbl is an array we just created that has all the possible values of doy for example 365, 366, 1, 2.p  pThis seems like it should trigger partition pruning, but doesnt. Based on the execution plan, it filters based on this IN at the end, after all the other joins are complete, even if the codePUSHSUBQcode hint is used. codetablecode is pruned thanks to the remaining conditions, but codetable1code never is.p  pAnother attempt was something like thisp  precodeWHERE table1.doy BETWEEN doymin AND doymax OR        doymin gt doymax AND table1.doy NOT BETWEEN doymax AND doymin codepre  pThat seemed to sort of work table1 said KEYOR in its exec plan but some tables in the join were not pruned. Is there a way to restructure this such that it would work, other than wrapping it in an IF and splitting it into 2 queries and bloating all the stored proceduresp  pThe other method was, when crossing the year boundary, doing 2 queries, one from 365366 and one from 12, and then just usingp  precodeWHERE table1.doy BETWEEN doymin AND doymax codepre  pThis worked all tables were accessed with KEYAP but once again this bloats the code.

Negative 32884 pIm trying to use Cmake to start a new Qt Project inside Visual Studio 2010. I want to recreate the standard setup, as if you were just creating a new Qt project inside MSVS using the Qt Addin. Since I only have limited knowledge of Cmake and the internet is running out of ideas I need your help. The reason why I want to do this is because I have an existing Visual Studio project and I need to add a GUI. So what I did was creating a new Qt project inside Visual Studio with just the default QtWindow.

Negative 32884 pI have a question if this is valid or just plain random that it works for me. I have simplified the problem and broke it down to this I have a class codeAcode, which calls a function outside of the class, which will call the destructor of that class. The destructor is called and the object is destroyed, but is this valid C and wont cause any sideeffects. For better understanding, I have written an examplep  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt  class A  void testfuncA  a  class A          public                 A                          stdcout ltlt Destructor called ltlt stdendl                                  void testfunction                          stdcout ltlt A before ltlt stdendl                         testfuncthis                         stdcout ltlt A after ltlt stdendl                    void testfuncA  a          stdcout ltlt testfunc before ltlt stdendl         delete a         stdcout ltlt testfunc after ltlt stdendl   int main          A  a  new A         agttestfunction         return 0  codepre  pIn this example, the member function codetestfunctioncode is called, which calls codetestfunccode outside of the class, which destroys the object. The output isp  precodeA before testfunc before Destructor called testfunc after A after codepre  pIf its valid, then I have the question, why the function codetestfunctioncode inside of A is running until end, even when the object is destroyed Is this the same behaviour as codedelete thiscode which is legalp  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 32884 pI have a legacy database linked to a CakePHP 2.5.3 application. The database has a LOT of columns in all of its tables, many of which are completely unused for example in one table I only need 2 columns out of 80 blank ones, so as a result I always have to specify fields whenever I run a query. I read elsewhere that I can unset the fields by using code like this in the modelp  precodefunction beforeFindquery    thisgtschema    unsetthisgtschema[ColumnName]   unsetthisgtschema[ColumnName2]   etc.  codepre  pAnd this seems to work okay, the problem is that I am using 80 lines of code to unset columns when really I only need to set two. Is there a way to force CakePHP to let me manually define the columns in the schemap  pI have tried declaring the schema variable at the start of the model and that doesnt seem to help.p

Negative 32884 pIm developing an Android application which periodically reports back to a data server via a REST API call. Whenever the app tries to send one of these reports, but no network channel wifi or mobile data is available, the app will create a wrapper for that task and put it in a queue that is attached to a codeBroadcastReceivercode. The receiver listens for either codeandroid.net.wifi.STATECHANGEcode or codeandroid.net.conn.CONNECTIVITYCHANGEcode and then tries to execute the enqueued task on the new connection. All of the authentication logic is handled here as well. The actual request POSTs are going out via the Retrofit library.p  pMy problem is that, whenever network access comes back, and the receiver tries to kick off all the tasks that are waiting, I always get back a codejava.net.UnknownHostExceptioncode, stating that the host name of the data server has no associated address. It seems that, while the Android device knows that its connected to a network, it still hasnt figured out where to get DNS from, and any requests that go out while its in this state will fail.p  precodeDRetrofit java.net.UnknownHostException Unable to resolve host [REDACTED] No address associated with hostname         at java.net.InetAddress.lookupHostByNameInetAddress.java424         at java.net.InetAddress.getAllByNameImplInetAddress.java236         at java.net.InetAddress.getAllByNameInetAddress.java214         at com.squareup.okhttp.internal.Network1.resolveInetAddressesNetwork.java29         at com.squareup.okhttp.internal.http.RouteSelector.resetNextInetSocketAddressRouteSelector.java266         at com.squareup.okhttp.internal.http.RouteSelector.nextProxyRouteSelector.java240         at com.squareup.okhttp.internal.http.RouteSelector.nextUnconnectedRouteSelector.java156         at com.squareup.okhttp.internal.http.RouteSelector.nextRouteSelector.java130         at com.squareup.okhttp.internal.http.HttpEngine.connectHttpEngine.java312         at com.squareup.okhttp.internal.http.HttpEngine.sendRequestHttpEngine.java235         at com.squareup.okhttp.Call.getResponseCall.java262         at com.squareup.okhttp.CallApplicationInterceptorChain.proceedCall.java219         at com.squareup.okhttp.Call.getResponseWithInterceptorChainCall.java192         at com.squareup.okhttp.Call.executeCall.java79         at retrofit.client.OkClient.executeOkClient.java53         at retrofit.RestAdapterRestHandler.invokeRequestRestAdapter.java326         at retrofit.RestAdapterRestHandler.invokeRestAdapter.java240         at [REDACTED]Native Method         at [REDACTED]         [etc]   Caused by libcore.io.GaiException getaddrinfo failed EAINODATA No address associated with hostname   Caused by libcore.io.ErrnoException getaddrinfo failed ENETUNREACH Network is unreachable codepre  pThe rootcause exception codelibcore.io.ErrnoExceptioncode claims that the network is unreachable, but I dont even try this execution until after Ive emreceived an intentem from the Android OS emspecifically becauseem the network is now, in fact, reachable.p  pMy code for verifying wifi availabilityp  pre classlangjava prettyprintoverridecodeprotected static boolean isWifiAvailable WifiManager wifi       WifiInfo info  wifi.getConnectionInfo      if info  null  return false      if info.getNetworkId  1  return false      if info.getSupplicantState  SupplicantState.COMPLETED          return false      return true   codepre  pMy code for verifying mobile data availabilityp  pre classlangjava prettyprintoverridecodeprotected static boolean isMobileDataAvailable TelephonyManager tmgr       return tmgr.getDataState  TelephonyManager.DATACONNECTED    codepre  pstrongQuestionstrong Is there a more reliable signal  something Im not checking in codeWifiInfocode and codeTelephonyManagercode  that would indicate that the network channel is emreally, reallyem ready Or is this a race condition with no clear resolutionp
