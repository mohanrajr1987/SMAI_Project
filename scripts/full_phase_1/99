Positive 99 pI have a requirement where I need to copy some exe files from one machine which is in network of company A to another machine which is in network of company B. The issue I have is both the companies resources are not shared as they are very strict when it comes to Network saftey and also they are not willing to open any ports to outside access. p  pIs there a way to copytransfer the files to company B from company Ap  pPS. I am using citrix to access machines of company B from company A. Is there any library available from Citrix to accomplish this task. p  pThanks a lot for your help on this. p
Positive 99 pI recently came across quite a useful load balancingreverse proxy tool called Nginx. I know that it equally sends out the incoming requests to my four servers, and that is great, but it gives me a different issue.p  pSuppose I was running a blog of some sort, and a new user created his account and was redirected by Nginx to go to one of servers, lets say Server 1 of 4. Now hes working. He sets up his page, posts a couple posts about cats, and now hes ready to pack it in for the night, and he logs out.p  pThe next morning he logs back in, but this time Nginx redirects him to Server 2 of 4. He goes to his blog page, but nothing is there because all of the .html files were stored on Server 1 of 4.p  pBasically, my question is how is one of the servers on the network supposed to access, or even know, where a file is on another serverp  pRight now, I have a couple of ideas. Ill list them below, and you guys tell me if they are even possible.p  ol lipHave one central server for storing all files. This server doesnt take any requests. It just provides all of the .html, .css, and .js files for the server that needs them. I still dont know how to access these files thoughpli lipSynchronize all files on all servers. When one file updates, all of the duplicate files update. This seems like kind of a waste of server space, thoughpli ol  pOnce again, Im sorry if this is a really dumb question. Im not too experienced in these things. Im using Ubuntu Linux Server edition by the way. Thanks guys.p

Positive 99 pIm trying to write something to parse the used cluster bitmap data on an NTFS partition.

Ive read that theres the MFT zone which gets preallocated to cover a bunch of the known mft records including BitMap and it takes up 12.5 of the disk.

Positive 99 pHere is what I am trying to acheive. I have a FUSE filesystem that is running on my server. I want to be able to mount this filesystem on my client. I implemented my filesystem using pythonfusepy. I have read a little about xmlrpclib which can be used for communication between the client and server.

Negative 99 pI have been rather successful in promoting JQuery within my organization. No small feat on its own. However, one of the ideas being kicked around here to make it part of our app is to create an ASP.net server side control. We are going to be sticking with WebForms for the foreseeable future.p  pIm not too wild about this approach as it seems like overkill when a couple of script tags will do the job.  We found an a hrefhttpwww.westwind.comWebLogposts167052.aspx relnofollowarticlea on the web, and the amount of code involved really doesnt seem to justify itself. However, I do hear that there is some benefit in the script caching or generating that happens with the server controls.p  pMy questionsp  ul liHas anyone else written an ASP.net server control to serve up the JQuery js codeli liDoes anyone else think that this is a crazy idea to just avoid writing JQuery or Javascript codeli ul

Negative 99 pI have an IE BHO thats in development in C. It is supposed to wait for the user to do some stuff, contact our server and download some data, and then alter the DOM of the currently loaded web page with the results.p  pI am running into some seemingly insurmountable issues relating to the rules of COM compartmentalization and threading  namely, I cant seem access the IE DOMDocument outside of the current thread and I cant think of any way to run something asynchronously without locking up IE until its finished.p  pMy first attempt had the background servercommunication stuff do its thing in an eventdriven fashion my program would initiate communications from within an mshtml event BeforeNaviagate2 or DocumentComplete, for example, and would post the results from within a separate event handler fired by the server communication object when it finished its work.p  pThat techniqued worked fine in a quick simulator I cobbled together just a simple app with a WebBrowser control but in IE it would throw a COM exception because I was attempting to alter page DOM through a separate thread.p  pSo I tried keeping everything in the same function, and having my code wait for the server communications object to do its work with a while loop, like thisp  precode     int waited  0     while OurServerCommRequest.ready      System.Threading.Thread.Sleep1     Application.DoEvents     waited      if waited  constants.TIMEOUTOURSERVERREQUEST      log.wLTimed out             codepre  pThe problem with this approach is while the code stays in the original thread, it executes synchroniously with the IE process it fired in in IE8, its one process per tab  like Google Chrome  it seems ... therefore locking up the IE interface until my server communications completes.p  pInitially I wanted to start processing as soon as the URL was available via NavigationComplete2 event but I discovered that waiting for the ltbody tag to become available should my server communications finish before the users page loaded would also lock up IE  throwing it into an infinite loop while my code waits for the HTML body, while the page is prevented from updating itself do to the aforementioned loop.p  pIve thought about moving all this into the actual users page javascript but it seems that by doing so I am opening up a can of worms in wrangling with XSS security issues.p  pSo... my question is such is it possible to run code asynchroniously in an C IE BHO while still being able to manipulate the users page DOM Ive asked around some friends and most people tell me that it is not likely.

Also, the dataset will not start with numbers  it is guaranteed to start with a letter from AZ.p  pIve started building the algorithm for this, but it keeps getting so messy I start over.

Negative 99 pIn an OO component, when you have only one implementation available for an class and that class is not published to other components, is it still advisable to have an interface and work with the interface instead p  pI am fully aware of programming to an interface design principle and also use it extensively. p  pLately, I have been observing that most of the time a different implementation although possible and would make sense is never needed. As a result of always working with interfaces, the application code would have a fair amount of interfaces with just one implementation for each and the interface seems sort of an overhead.p  pInstead, is it preferable to just work with the concrete class and introduce the interface only when a second implementation is needed Anyway, nowadays extracting an interface using IDEs is a breeze. And when the new interface is introduced, references to the old concrete class can be changed to use the new interface instead. p  pWhat do you thinkp

The way I see it, I could do it several waysp  ul lipin the abstract superclass Message, have an abstract method isValid. A variation on this would be to have isValid be called when the Message constructor is called, throwing a MalformedMessageException if the message is formatted incorrectly.pli lipin the transport layer, immediately before sending, validate the message. I would have a sendMessage method that calls an isValidMessage method immediately before it sends.pli liphave a singleton message validator with a static method isValidMessage that is called at some point.pli ul  pIm sure there are other options that Im missing. Currently, Im leaning towards the first one, but it doesnt feel right to me to have validation code in what should be a domain object.p

Negative 99 pI need to encrypt a string using MySQLs AESENCRYPT function, then attach that encrypted string to the end of a URL, such that it can then be decrypted and used by a PHP script on the other end.p  pBasically, I am encrypting the string using MySQLs AESENCRYPT, I am then using PHPs rawurlencode function to make it URL safe. I then pass the encrypted string in a URL, which is then retrieved by the PHP script on the other end where it gets successfully decrypted... about 95 of the time.p  pSeems as though about 5 of strings are encrypting in such a way that they are getting corrupted somewhere in the process, and cant be decoded on the other end after being passed by a URL. Can anyone help me out here Is there a 100 foolproof way to do this I have also tried using urlencode as well as base64encode in varying combinations.p  pThanks.p

Negative 99 pA client of mine has a site in wordpress, with one section being a directory of agents that each have different text and videos associated with them. p  pThe client wants to be able to easily addremovechange these agents from within the wordpress admin interface. There will be anywhere from 5075 of these agents, so doing each page manually is not very attractive. p  pWe currently have 3 agents added as posts, and i understand that we can store additional information inside the post itself, so that is not a problem. What we would like to create is a simpler way of managing those pages where the content cannot be changed by the maintainer, and the additional fields on the post are hard coded so there would be no room for user error.p  pWhat i am interested in is if anyone has done something similar in the past and can share their approach and experience, or if anyone can point me in the right direction as to how i can accomplish this and what i need to be aware of.p  pThanks.p

Negative 99 pLike many other developers out there, Ive created iPhone projects that use a codeUITabBarControllercode as the root controller, with the tab views using codeUINavigationControllercodes to drill down from lists to detail views. And like many other developers out there, I need to migrate these apps to the iPad so they take advantage of the bigger screen and more importantly, not forcing the user to use the ugly doubling visualization for iPhoneonly apps.p  pApple created the codeUISplitViewControllercode for this exact scenario... seemingly. I say seemingly because although I see it used in Settings, iPod, iTunes, and so on, none of those applications use codeUISplitViewControllercode inside a codeUITabBarControllercode, because its not only documented as not working, but apps can crash if those two are forced into a shotgun marriage.p  pConsider a hypothetical iPhone application all about Animals. It has three tabs Categories where animals are categorized by some simple method  perhaps we have a twolevel hierarchy with categories like Birds and Fish, Search which uses a standard codeUITableViewcode and a codeUISearchDisplayControllercode, and Stories, which are stories about animals perhaps there is a story about frogs, and another about computer nerd horses that turned into l33t unicorns.p  pWhile Categories and Search are two tabs that could be merged, its not clear that you could or should merge the emlistem of animals with the emstoriesem about the animals. So while you might like to use a UISplitViewController on the iPad with the search integrated in the root, left, side of the split, how do you present the Stories view Do you use a segmented controller Top or Bottom Root or Detail view of the split Or perhaps you use a home screen like WebMDs iPad app which shows two buttons Categories and Stories and then shows a split view for whichever the user taps Or a toolbar at the top or bottomp  pI tried looking at several other apps, including Settings, Mail, iPod, iTunes, Contacts, Maps and so on, but none of them present two different kinds of information in one application.p  pWhats the general approach here Are there any best practices Any general patterns that the iPad programming community has adoptedp  pOr do I wait and cross my fingers that Apple somehow eventually allows codeUISplitViewControllercode to work without requiring it to be the root That might never happenp

Negative 99 pWhile trying to clone an existing Subversion repository using gitsvn using standard layout, I got a bunch of codeW emptydircode and codeW emptydircode warnings. The cloned git repository seems to be working, i.e. I can do usual git operations and dcommit to SVN repository.p  pThe real problem is that the initial clone and rebase create some empty directories that do not exist in SVN repository, at the top of the repository along with other directories in trunk. These directories contain no file but just some empty directories inside them. It seems that the W emptydir warnings correspond to these empty directories.p  pI looked for empty directories by checking out the whole repository using SVN, but there is no empty directory. I also checked through SVN if the repository has files with special properties, but there was not any other than executable and mimetype.p  pThe existing repository was not originally following the standard layout, but I cleaned it up so that the top directories are just trunk, tags, and branches.p  pWhat can be causing the creation of these empty directories that do not exist under Subversionp

Negative 99 pI have a problem with using HTML5 elements in Internet Explorer 7 and up not testing IE6. I know that by default, IE refuses to recognize common HTML5 elements like article or header without the use of a Javascript shiv. Ive used modernizr httpwww.modernizr.com to force IE to recognize these elements to that I can apply CSS styles to them. So far so good.p  pThe problem now is that the application uses Javascript to fetch certain HTML fragments containing HTML5 markup and inserts them into the document at runtime. On all other browsers, this works flawlessly, but in IE, elements inserted at runtime cant be styled with CSS. p  pHeres an example of the chunk of markup that Im injecting into the pagep  precodeltarticle idblock1 classblockgt   lta hrefgt       lth2gtTitlelth2gt       ltpgtTextltpgt       ltimg srchttpdummyimage.com100x100 width100 height100 altplaceholder gt   ltagt ltarticlegt codepre  pIve tested my theory by replacing the article tag by a common div, which seems to solve the problem for now, at the expense of semantic markup.

Negative 99 pEver since I switched from Windows XP to Windows 7 Ive noticed that the flash web games that Ive been working on have been running much more jerkily.  Even though my fps counter reports that the game is drawing at 60FPS the frame rate looks very inconsistent.  Its not smooth at all.  p  pI finally tracked this down to Windows Aero being turned on.  If I set the desktop to Windows Classic mode, then I see similar smoothness to what I was getting before on my XP machine.  p  pAlso, with Aero on, I emcanem get the game to run smoothly if I make it go fullscreen or if I set wmodedirect in the objectembed tag parameters.  Unfortunately, neither of these solutions is ideal for me, so Im sort of hoping someone has experienced this problem and knows of another workaround.  Here are some more speficic detailsp  pMy games framerate is set to 60.  I update the game logic and render the frame to a BitmapData in response to an ENTERFRAME event.  My game logic updates based on how much time has passed since the last call to ENTERFRAME.  Additionally, since it runs very smoothly with wmodedirect, I know that its not the game logic or rendering that is 100 to blame for the jerkiness.p  pI recorded my screen a 60FPS laptop LCD with a high speed digital camera 210FPS.  In my recording test, I have a counter which I increment and draw on every ENTERFRAME.  Sometimes the counter does indeed increment by 1 on the recording.  But it also increments by 2 and even occasionally 3  Of course, there are more frames on the recorded video between the increment when the size of the increment is bigger.  p  pIts as if ENTERFRAME were called, but the results were not copied to the display.  I could see this happening in a perverse case where its called just after the screen refresh on one frame and then just before the screen refresh on the next frame so you never see the first draw.  But how could it skip two frames  Additionally, this is not just a skip here or there.  For instance, Ive seen it increment by 3 frames eight times in a row  i.e.  The video shows frame 3752 just appearing, I hit next frame on the video player 11 times and then I see frame 3755 appearing with no 3753 or 3754 in between.  And then this continues to happen going to frame 3758, 3761, ... , and 3776  p  pAnyway, Im wondering if I just may be doing something to anger the flash gods, and is there a way to appease them in order to attain a wonderfully smooth framerate without using wmodedirect, going fullscreen, or sacrificing animalsp

Negative 99 pTwo years ago I wrote a simple upload applet using Java, developed using NetBeans. When I first hit Clean and Build back then, and for some time afterwards, it worked perfectly. It would run through the build process and produce a JAR file that I could then upload to my web server, and the applet worked great.p  pNow, as Im going back in and making some slight modifications to this applet, it no longer produces the JAR file when I hit Clean amp Build. The actual code changes I made are so minute that I can guarantee they would have no bearing on this literally just changing the contents of a few strings.

Negative 99 pIm trying to implement a codeReservationControllercode which is responsible for taking reservations of something for a specific time range. So far I guessed using one column for the Date codeDateTimecode and two columns for the time span 2x codeTimecode in the database would be a good idea. Especially when it comes to queries on date, this approach is easier because I know, that the codeDateTimecode column is always set to 12am. So I just query codeDateTimecode.Today for instance. But now Im getting into trouble with reservations which are passing the day border eg. Today 22pm  Tomorrow 1am. Could you please give me some advice what is a common solution for this problem what database schema I should usep  pregardsp

Negative 99 pAloha everyone,p  pI apologize in advance for the many questions, but Ive been asked to develop a database and have no experience with PHP and MySQL.  I thought it would be a good exercise for me to attempt to learn a little bit about them and try to develop a concept database for my work at the same time.  Basically this is a database that uses SYDI to obtain WMI information from our Windowsbased computers to use for patch management.  The way I envision this working is like thisp  ol liSYDI is run and an XML file is generated with the information.li liUsing the PHP front end to our patch database, the XML report is parsed and the desired information is then inserted into the MySQL database.li liReports are generated from the database to compare with the latest known baseline for the activity.  If computers are found to be below the baseline, the patch server is used to deliver the needed patches to the delinquent computers.li ol  pThere are a couple of formats used in the XML report from SYDI, one with attributes in a single tag, and another where a single parent tag contains several child tags with attributes.  I have figured out how to parse the first.  Heres a sample of the data and the code for that its really pretty basic stuff with the resulting ouputp  precodeltmachineinfo manufacturerDell Inc. productnamePrecision M90 identifyingnumber87ZGFD1 chassisPortable gt   xml  simplexmlloadfilesydiTest.xml  foreachxmlgtmachineinfo[0]gtattributes as a gt b              echo b, ltbrgt       Dell Inc. Precision M90 87ZGFD1 Portable codepre  pI didnt need the name of the attribute, only the value, so I only echod b there.  For the second, heres a sample of the data itself as well as the code and output for the parsep  precode ltpatchesgt   ltpatch descriptionMicrosoft .NET Framework 1.1 Security Update KB2416447 hotfixidM2416447 installdate04Feb11 gt   ltpatch descriptionMicrosoft .NET Framework 1.1 Service Pack 1 KB867460 hotfixidS867460 installdate04Feb11 gt   ltpatch descriptionWindows Management Framework Core hotfixidKB968930 installdate242011 gt   ltpatch descriptionSecurity update for MSXML4 SP2 KB954430 hotfixidQ954430 installdate04Feb11 gt   ltpatch descriptionSecurity update for MSXML4 SP2 KB973688 hotfixidQ973688 installdate04Feb11 gt   ltpatch descriptionMicrosoft Internationalized Domain Names Mitigation APIs hotfixidIDNMitigationAPIs installdate6302008 gt  ltpatchesgt  foreach xmlgtpatchesgtpatch[0]gtattributes as a gt b               echo b, ltbrgt       Microsoft .NET Framework 1.1 Security Update KB2416447 M2416447 04Feb11 codepre  pAs you can see, I only got the first patch, not the rest of them.  I figure that patch[0] is most likely the issue, as it only references the first child tag.  How can I get it to reference the rest of the children p  pThe results raise another issue.  Is there any way to pick out specific attributes and disregard the rest  For example, in the first parse, the machineinfo parse gets all the information I need.  In the second parse, I only need the description and hotfixid.  Once I get the correct syntax for the parse, assuming it runs like the first one, I would most likely get all of the attributes.  I dont need the install date.  p  pLastly, how can I assign the retrieved values to variables  The first parse results in the data I need, but not in the correct order.  My table structure is like thisp  precodeCREATE TABLE InventoryItems     InvSerNum          VARCHAR20 NOT NULL,     Make                VARCHAR20,     Model               VARCHAR20,     Platform            VARCHAR12, CONSTRAINT InventoryPK PRIMARY KEY InvSerNum codepre  pI need the identifyingnumber InvSerNum first.  Of course, I could always reorder the fields in the table to match the XML, but Id rather leave it as is.  My thinking is that I can use an INSERT statement and just use the variables for the values to be input.p  pIm trying to do all of this on my own, but got stuck on the XML parsing part.  If anyone can assist me in understanding the process, I would be in your debt.p

Negative 99 pA web site of mine has tables nested within absolutelypositioned draggable dialogs that showhide based on some user interactions.  Its worth mentioning that these tables have codetablelayout autocode and codewidth autocode.  A problem arose where a table had so many rows that it went off the bottom edge of the screen.  This caused issues with the dragging since we have limited the dragging to the edges of the viewport.  To fix the issue, I wrapped the table in a codeltdivgtcode and set codemaxheight 400px overflow autocode on it.  This gives the user a nice vertical scroll bar whenever the table exceeds the maxheight.  That works, but for some reason the browser both IE and Chrome is not taking the width of the scroll bar into consideration, so anytime the height of the table exceeds the max and triggers an overflow, the table gets scrunched over to the left and some cells in the first column have a very ugly wordwrap applied to them.  Without the overflowmaxheight combination, the table width is calculated correctly and there is no overflow.p  pstronga hrefhttpjsfiddle.net8bpyX2 relnofollowLive Demo on jsFiddleastrongp  pI found two ways around this, both of which are not feasible...p  ol liExplicitly set the width on each of the cells or use codetablelayout fixedcodeli liUse codeoverflowy scrollcode instead of auto which causes the scroll bar to emalwaysem appear, even when it is not needed. What makes this worse is that overflowy is a CSS3 property.li ol  pThere must be a better solution  How can I get a vertical scrollbar on the parent of my table without any wordwrappingp

Negative 99 pI have large number of UserControls that are very similar.   They share a lot of common behavior.  I been using a base class that has the common stuff and then specializing the class as needed. p  precodeclass BaseControl  UserControl       common     class RedControl  BaseControl      specialized   class BlueControl  BaseControl      specialized  codepre  petc ...p  pThis works fairly well until I needed to start inserting or changing the layout of the child controls contained in BaseControl.   For example RedControl needs to add a Button to a particular panel of the base control. In other case I need to change the size or layout of other base child controls. p  pWhen I tried the following code, I did not see any button at run time...p  precodepublic partial class RedControl  BaseControl    public RedControl        InitializeComponent      addButtonToBase   no button shows up      this.PerformLayout      void addButtonToBase        Button button   new Button     button.Anchor  System.Windows.Forms.AnchorStylesSystem.Windows.Forms.AnchorStyles.Top  System.Windows.Forms.AnchorStyles.Left     button.Location  new System.Drawing.Point3, 3     button.Size  new System.Drawing.Size23, 23     button.Text  My Button      baseSplitContainer.Panel1.Controls.Addbutton  protected child control in base       ...  codepre  pI emcanem make the button display as a child of baseSplitContainer if I make addButtonToBase virtual and manually add it to the generated code in InitalizeComponent of BaseControl.  The layout of BaseControl was still going on and you are permitted to call virtual functions in constructors in C.Net.... p  pSo even though it works, its not a nice solution.  For one thing, when I edit BaseControl in the VS designer, the call to addBaseControl in IntializeComponent gets removed, For another calling virtual functions in constructors feels dangerous. p  pI think I need to get the layout of the base control to happen again in the derived control... I tried that but either did it wrong or it wont work...p  pbtw yes I know WPF is good at this.  Cant use it because of constraints on other systems. p

Negative 99 pIm currently familiarizing myself with Prism 4.0 and MVVM using Cinch 2.0 as the MVVM framework.  Im building the shell for what will be an application with roughly 15 modules. Were using WPF.p  pThe application uses a ribbon for its menu system.  Modules are loaded when the user clicks on a button on the ribbon the shell handles that task through its viewmodel. The modules register their main view with the region manager the shell defines only one main region, for now anyway. Most modules are loaded on demand. This works fine in a simple scenariop  ul liUser clicks on a button. Module gets loaded, view is added to the region and displayed.li liUser clicks on a button for some other module. Same idea as above. The view for that module is displayed in the same region, replacing the view from the previous module.li ul  pWhere things stop working is when the user then clicks again on the button for a previously loaded module.  Since the module has already been loaded, pretty much nothing happens  the current view remains displayed on screen.  That makes sense  LoadModule is pretty much ignored or at least it looks like it is being ignored.p  pIve done quite a few searches on Google for this, and most answers I found required the shell to navigate to the view.  Now, unless Im mistaken, this is coupling the shell to the modules a bit too much The shell shouldnt know about the views in any module.  Essentially this seems to break the MVVM pattern.  The shell knowing about the modules is a necessary coupling in our case anyway  we dont cant use stuff like directory discovery.  But the shell knowing about each modules views is pushing it, in my opinion.p  pBottom line, the question is How can I navigate between existing views, using a ribbon interface well, the fact that its a ribbon has no bearing on this which is controlled by the shell, by having the shell tell an alreadyloaded module hey, youve got focus again, so display whatever view was displayed the last time you were the star of the show.p  pThen again maybe Im just going at this the wrong way... Wouldnt be a first. p  pThanksp

My guess is that the TWinControl I created is trying to free the handle of the plugins form emwindowem which doesnt exist any more.p  pWhat Ive triedp  precodeprocedure AddHandleToControlListAHandle DWORD Align TAlign var   NewWinControl  TWinControl begin   NewWinControl  TWinControl.CreatefrmMain   NewWinControl.WindowHandle  AHandle   NewWinControl.Align  Align   NewWinControl.Width  frmMain.ClientWidth   NewWinControl.Height  30   NewWinControl.Parent  frmMain end  procedure AddHandleToControlListAHandle DWORD Align TAlign var   NewWinControl  TWinControl begin   NewWinControl  TWinControl.CreatefrmMain   NewWinControl.WindowHandle  AHandle   NewWinControl.Align  Align   NewWinControl.Width  frmMain.ClientWidth   NewWinControl.Height  30   TWinControlfrmMain.InsertNewWinControl end codepre  pSoooo, thoughtsp  pstrongEDIT 1strongp  pOk, so this correctly adds the control to the list and conforms the the TAlign set why is it that I spend 8 hours trying to figure something out, I post here, and then the answer just appears...oh well someone might find this question and my ramblings usefulp  precodeprocedure AddHandleToControlListAHandle DWORD AName PChar ATop, ALeft, AWidth, AHeight Integer AAlign TAlign var   NewWinControl  TWinControl begin   NewWinControl  TWinControl.CreatefrmMain   With NewWinControl Do     begin     Name  AName     Top  ATop     Left  ALeft     Width  AWidth     Height  AHeight     Align  AAlign     WindowHandle  AHandle     Visible  True   end   TWinControlfrmMain.InsertControlNewWinControl end codepre  pThe issue now is that when the application closes, I get the invalid error AV...I shall continuep  pstrongEDIT 2strong Ok, so it is TWinControl.DestroyWindowHandle that raises the AV because the window handle doesnt exist any more.

Negative 99 pI have a number of asynchronous tasks to run in parallel. All the tasks can be divided into two types, lets call one  type A that are time consuming and everything else type B faster and quick to execute ones.  with a single ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor with x poolsize, eventually at some point all threads are busy executing type A, as a resul type B gets blocked and delayed.  what im trying to accomplish is to run a type A tasks parallel to type B, and i want tasks in both the types to run parallel within their group for performance . p  pWould you think its prudent to have two instances of ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor for the type A and B exclusively with their own thread pools  Do you see any issues with this approachp
Negative 99 pThis is what I havep  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netJedtY1 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netJedtY1ap  pIf you take a look at the result, you will see the first row, you will notice the buttons Change and Delete.p  pTry to click on it, and another button will appear, Add. p  pThis row doesnt work as I would like to.p  pNow see the next row. This is not in basket. Click on the row, and an Add button will appear only. If you click again it will disappear. This works properly.p  pSo my issue as is when it is in basket. I dont want it to show the buttons Change and Delete from the start, only when the row is highlighted when you have clicked. And somehow the Add button activates and appears, which it shouldnt.p  pHow can i fix this I know my JS can seem to be dirty  the append part, where all the html is , but I have not found a better way to append data to the table.p
Negative 99 pstrongNotestrong You may have to compile and run my example to fully understand my question. If this is not kosher, I apologize in advance.p  pI am trying to create a Swing control that is based on a codeJToggleButtoncode and a codeJPopupMenucode.p  pThe toggle button is selected iff the popup menu is visible, and the toggle button is deselected iff the popup menu is not visible. Thus, the behavior is similar to a codeJComboBoxcode, except that the popup can contain arbitrary components.p  pThe code that follows is an example of how I would create the control except that it would be in its own class... something like a codeJPopupToggleButtoncode. Unfortunately, it exhibits different behavior under different look and feels I have tested it with Metal and Nimbus.p  pThe code as posted here behaves as expected in Metal, but not in Nimbus.

Negative 99 pIve been doing web development for a few months now and keep having this nagging problem. It is typical for pages to request content with a query string which usually contains meaningful data such as an id in the database. An example would be a link such as     prehttpwww.example.compostsid5prep  pIve been trying to think of a good strategy to prevent users from manually entering a value for the id without having accessed it from a linkId only wish to acknowledge requests that were made by links presented on my website. Also, the website may not have an authentication system and allows for anonymous browsing that being said, the information isnt particularly sensitive but still I dont like the idea of not being able to control access to certain information. One option, I suppose, would be to use HTTP POST requests for these kind of pages  I dont believe a user can simulate a post request but I may be wrong.p  pFurthermore, the user could place any arbitrary number for the id and end up requesting a record that doesnt exist in the database. Of course, I could validate the requested id but then I would be wasting resources to accommodate this check.p  pAny thoughts Im working with django but a general strategy for any programming language would be good. Thanks.p

Unfortunately I dont see this as a workable solution perhaps through my own misunderstandingp  ol liThe async method, although assumed to be a wrapper for the sync method, is left without any real code contract and can therefore do as it wishes.li liCodebases which are committed to asynchrony are unlikely to implement sync counterparts for everything. As a result, implementing new methods which contain codeawaitcodes on other async methods are consequently forced to be async. These methods are intrinsically asynchronous and cannot easily be converted to synchronous. They are not simply wrappers.li ol  pEven if we invalidated the latter point by saying we could use code.Resultcode or code.Waitcode instead of codeawaitcode which would actually cause some codeSyncContextcodes to deadlock, and would have to be rewritten in the async method anyway, Im still convinced about the first point.p  pAre there any alternative ideas, or is there anything that Ive missed about codecontracts and TPLp

Negative 99 pI dont really understand what model of unix accountspermissions is intended with Capistrano. p  pLets say Ive got a rails app called Widget and Ill be deploying with passenger.   In general, precapistrano, I want the entire .widget directory to be owned by a user called widget. And then by default default passenger will run the app process as user widget too, because passenger runs as user that owns the file. p  pAnd the whole point of this is for that widget account to have fairly limited permissions, right Since a web app will be running under that accountp  pSo since I want the files to be owned by widget, I tell capp  pset user, widgetp  pBut now when I run cap deploysetup, it wants to sudo from that account. No way that widget account gets sudo privileges, the whole point is keeping this account limited privs. p  pOkay, I can tell cap not to use sudo... but then it wont actually have privs to do what it needs, maybe. p  pI can find a workaround to this too. But I start thinking, why do I keep having to reinvent the wheel I mistakenly thought the point of cap recipes was to give me some best practices here. Anyway... what do people actually do herep  pUse one unix account for install, but then have cap somehow chown it to something else Use one unix account, but have something noncap puppet do enough setup so that account doesnt need to sudo to get things started What What am  I missingp

Negative 99 pIm trying to develop a system that will allow users to update local, offline databases on their laptops and, upon reconnection to the network, synchronize their dbs with the main, master db.p  pI looked at MySQL replication, but that documentation focuses on unidirectional syncing. So I think Im going to build a custom app in python for doing this bilateral syncing, and I have a couple of questions.p  pIve read a couple of posts regarding this issue, and one of the items which has been passively mentioned is serialization which I would be implementing through the pickle and cPickle modules in python. Could someone please tell me whether this is necessary, and the advantages of serializing data in the context of syncing databasesp  pOne of the uses in wikipedias entry on serialization states it can be used as a method for detecting changes in timevarying data. This sounds really important, because my application will be looking at timestamps to determine which records have precedence when updating the master database. So, I guess the thing I dont really get is how pickling data in python can be used to detect changes in timevarying data, and whether or not this would supplement using timestamps in the database to determine precedence or replace this method entirely.p  pAnyways, high level explanations or code examples are both welcome. Im just trying to figure this out.p  pThanksp

possible solution would be for every derived class to have its own Allocator.

As expected by the fact of using a codeWrapGridcode, the control instances are stacked sequentially in a single row until there is no more room in the screen, at which point they appear in a new row and it is necessary to scroll down in order to see them. So far so good.p  pNow I want to implement a feature and I dont know how to achieve it. What I want is the following when the user zooms out in the application, causing the controls to appear smaller, I want the new available space to be used so that more controls can be displayed per row instead, the current behavior is that the codeItemsControlcode itself is reduced and the extra surrounding space is unused.p  pFor example, imagine that the user adds 10 controls. There is room for 4 controls in one row, so that 3 rows of controls are displayed, with 4, 4 and 2 controls. If the user zooms out and now there is room for 7 controls in a row, I want the codeItemsControlcode to rearrange itself so that now there are only two rows with 7 and 3 controls. How could I achieve thisp  pI hope I have explained myself properly. Please dont hesitate to ask if my question is not clear enough. Thank you very muchp

Negative 99 pI am using rendertotexture to do postprocessing and then blending several 2D layers together.p  pCurrently I am using stencil mask to make holes in rendertotexture targets and leaving some of the areas transparent. However, this is little cumbersome in my case. Id rather ignore the stencil mask and then just would use normal polyfill operations to draw the holes.p  pWhat kind of methods there exist for rendering fill to alpha 0.0 areas in the scene I.e. the existing rendettotexture destination alpha value would be ignored and just replaced with 0.0 value.

This is the one exampleslineWithFocusChart.html, nvd3 zip package which I have been working with during  the last 2 days. I have made only one change to the examples format I use dates in the X axis instead of normal numbers.p  pHere are my 2 questionsp  p1 How can i rotate all the ticks labels in the x axis My dates are too long x X, day and time and I want them rotated in oder to improve their viewing. I can only get 2 ticks rotated the max and min, the edges, of the x axis. This is the code I modify inside the switch axis.orient block at nv.d3.jsp  precodecase bottom       axisLabel.enter.appendtext.attrclass, axislabel           .attrtextanchor, middle           .attry, 25       axisLabel           .attrx, scale.range[1]  2       if showMaxMin          var axisMaxMin  wrap.selectAllg.axisMaxMin                        .datascale.domain         axisMaxMin.enter.appendg.attrclass, axisMaxMin.appendtext         axisMaxMin.exit.remove         axisMaxMin             .attrtransform, functiond,i                return translate  scaled  ,0                        .selecttext              .attrdy, .71em             .attry, axis.tickPadding             .attrtextanchor, middle             .textfunctiond,i                return   axis.tickFormatd.matchNaN    axis.tickFormatd                          .attrtransform, rotate45                      d3.transitionaxisMaxMin             .attrtransform, functiond,i                return translate  scale.range[i]  ,0                           break codepre  pAs you can check i have placed .attrtransform, rotate45 as new attribute so the max and min ticks are rotated axisMaxMin. I have tried this way throughout the nv.d3.js file with the other text elements that I think are associated with the x ticks but it doesnt work. Any idea Where I have to put the transformation in order to show all the X labels rotatedp  p2 In the example, when you place the mouse over the line, no event is triggered to show the value x,y associated with the point. How can i show those values Ive tried to copypaste the methods used in other examples where these values are showed but it doesnt work. Any ideap  pThanks for sharing your time and knowledge D.p
Negative 99 pI hope this question isnt too generalambiguous...p  pIm writing an iphone quiz game app and am having trouble figuring out the best way to handle data.

Negative 99 pIve been programming for a few years, and I know how to create my own complex methods using preexistingstandard libraries. I was always wondering Java for example how is a JFrame created when creating a JFrame object in Java How do you use standard code no libraries to code a GUI or complex operations like creating files, reading files, etc.p  pIf all these existing methods we use can be compared to building blocks we use to build a pyramid. How are these blocks created in the first place I mean technically. A programming language without standard libraries is variables, loops, and math and even the math functions were created by someone.p  pThe basic question is Does Java or C or any other language while operating on Windows for example complete all its operations by calling Windows .dll libraries for creating windows and other complex operations p  pIf so, How were these complex operationsmethodsfunctions created in an operating system with just regular variables, loops, etc.p  pTheres a gap in my understanding of programming. I understand computers read binary electricity  onoff, someone made assemblyassembler to convert binary to more readable code which moves numbers from different registers in a processor, which can lead to basic math, addition, subtraction, multiplication, divison. The gap in my understanding is the jump from Assembly to a higher language like C that holds variables, does loops, creates GUIS, Operating systems.p

Negative 99 pIm working for a large telco and our department has recently moved to an enterprise agile model of working all very exciting  Weve ran specific agilefriendly projects in the past, but are now trying to deliver our whole program using Agile principles.  Most of our work is systems integration and configuration based, there is very little software development we run inhouse.p  pIm now trying to deliver features from our lifecyle program and trying to encourage the team to write customer value focused stories, but how do you do that when the feature requires a large amount of technical foundation work, to deliver a very locked slice of user functionality 3rd party software already defines what the user can and cannot dop  pAs an example, we have a feature to deliver existing Customer Reports via a new reporting solution.  No new functionality will be delivered  at least as part of the inital release. We have identifed a set of standard reports we will build for our users. These are our customer value stories. But to deliver one story we need to deploy and configure new hosts, a new business objects database, new data collection points, a new data aggregation and extraction layer and export current customer data into the solution and validate  adjust presentation  before we can build and deliver the actual report.  p  pThe delivery of the new Customer Queue report is our EPIC story, how should we capture all the technical foundation work that is required to deliver this  Can the staging of a host and build of a database be written as a user story or just as a tech tasks. If it is written as a nonestimated task, we will run approx 45 iterations before we can deliver a single user story. Even if trying to deliver a minimum slice of capability this story is for a large scale customer with large data volumes and there is a lot of tech effort required to deliver the first value storyp  pIve searched on this excellent site, on the web and in books such as Mike Cohns and advise seems to be predominately software development based.  Ive love to get some answers on this that i can apply to large enterprise wise engineering projects. As the Agile movement grows and expands away for its soft dev roots this must be a growing problem for teams out therep

Negative 99 pThe problem is that as soon as the login form appears, the user sees the cursor in the password textbox blinking focus is programatically set, and types in the password, but keyboard input is completely ignored until the textbox is clicked with the mouse.p  pIn development boxes, this does not happen, even with machines with just one monitor. I have a typical login form which extends codeSystem.Windows.Forms.Formcode with a user name combo box and a password textbox. In production machines, the app runs in a kiosk environment of sorts, without Windows Explorer we use a .bat and a registry key to have only our app start when Windows starts. This is definitely related to the issue, but I cant figure out how. I configured a notebook this way in order to reproduce and test the issue.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 99 pI have an application written in CCLI that uses a library written in C.  The application was written using standard socket APIs and uses select to multiplex a bunch of ordinary nonasync sockets.  However, the third party library uses .NET sockets and uses the asynchronous results and callbacks.p  pHeres the scenario  I create a bunch of regular sockets in the main thread a CCLI application that uses mostly nativestyle code.  I create the third party library vendors C session object which, internally, has a bunch of asynchronous sockets from the .NET classes.p  pWhat I noticed was that if I put a NULL timeout parameter into select in the main thread in which I instantiate the C session object, that no asynchronous callbacks are made at all for their .NET sockets.  If I use a timeout of, say, 1second, and no other activity happens on my nonasync sockets, then no asyncsocket callbacks are delivered until select times out.p  pSomehow, select is preventing the callbacks to happen for the .NET sockets.  How do I avoid this  Is there some alternative polling method I can use for the old sockets that would still allow the .NET sockets to have their asynchronous callbacks deliveredp

Negative 99 pI have an Android app which uses a service to continuously update a textview in the view when the app is open. It updates it using a broadcast receiver which it sends intents to. By the nature of the app, the service needs to continue to run even after the app has exitedthe view is gone. Obviously its not wise to run the service on the main thread in this case, as that will hog up too much and eventually force close and crash the app. So what is the best way to keep this service running An ASyncTask A separate thread How would I go about doing this I tried it with an ASyncTask like thisp  precodeprivate class MyTask extends AsyncTask       Override     protected Object doInBackgroundObject... objects          return getActivity.getApplicationContext.startServiceintent           Override     protected void onCancelled          getActivity.getApplicationContext.stopServiceintent         super.onCancelled       codepre  pOh yeah, Im using getActivity.getApplicationContext because this is inside of a fragment.p  pSo this works fine I call MyTask.execute when I want to start it and MyTask.canceltrue when I want to stop it, but Im pretty sure Im not using it how it should be used. I dont even know what Im supposed to use as the argument for the execute method . And it doesnt seem to be the best idea to just start a service in it and nothing else, surely that would work better using just a thread Whats the proper way to go about this, in order for it to work the way it was intended to By the way, although this does work for much longer than running it on the main thread, it does still crash after several hours. p

Negative 99 pIm working on an online booking system, so I have a php script that receives a date and will output an array of possible timeslots that are free on that date.

Negative 99 pthis is my first post on stackoverflow and im new to Android. I already searched the forum for a similar question and found this one a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5015856androidsaxparserprogressmonitoringSAX parser progress monitoringa. But unfortunately it doesnt help me. My app has to register events in the calendar. The first thing i achieved was to progress the download of a xml file. You can see this in the attached code. After that i want the progressDialog to reset and start tracking the progress of the parsing. Would be great if this could be done with a new setMessage and a percentage value. After the parsing the data is used to register events in the calendar, again with the same progressDialog.p  pBut at first i want to know how i can track the progress of the parsing.

Well, Ive changed to 1.6 version in Java Facet too, but when I do a Maven  Update project, my projects properties are restored to default a.k.a. 1.5 version, and the Unknown error persists.p  pMy pom.xml file seems to be ok, and I also try to update project with an empty pom.xml just with modelVersion, groupId, artifactId, version, name and url tags and I always get the same error.p  pIm really stuck. Someone has a cluep
Negative 99 pIve been searching for the answer to this, but nothing yet.p  pI am trying to work around an issue were I have a view that resizes automatically.  If 3GS, etc... it uses picture.png, if iphone 4 amp 5 it uses picture2x.png.p  pHowever when the resize happens, the background on iphone 4 stretches below the bottom border, so part of the background is covered.  p  pon the iphone 5 it fits perfectly, but the buttons dont adjust, they stay in place like if the screen was from a 3G same thing if the iphone 4 is the simulator.p  pIf you have a solution for the above issue, I am all ears, I am very new to xcode, and Im just trying to learn.p  pAs a work around I was thinking about checking for screensize, and then loading a xib built for that screen, however my app crashes with the following codep  precode idinitWithNibNameNSString nibNameOrNil bundleNSBundle nibBundleOrNil  CGRect screenBound  [[UIScreen mainScreen] bounds] CGSize screenSize  screenBound.size CGFloat screenHeight  screenSize.height  if screenHeight  568     nibNameOrNil  NSStringmain5      self  [self initWithNibNamenibNameOrNil bundlenil]     if self           Custom initialization       else     self  [super initWithNibNamenibNameOrNil bundlenibBundleOrNil]     if self           Custom initialization    return self codepre  pThank you in advancedp  pdebugp  pself    Mainscreencantroller   0x00000000 nibNameOrNil    NSString   0x02a01196 NSObject    NSObjectbr isa Class   0x656a626f [0] Classbr nibBundleOrNil  NSArrayM     0x0a55d3e0p

Negative 99 pI have a project that uses the a hrefhttparchive.msdn.microsoft.compkcs12protectedconfg relnofollowPkcs12ProtectedConfigurationProvidera. There were never any problems using this dll in azure when targeting windows server 2008 sp2 or r2. However, when I tried to deploy to azure using windows server 2012 osFamily3, I got an exception stating that the assembly could not be found.p  pI vaguely recall running into this in the emulator, and the solution was to add this dll to the GAC. I googled and found a hrefhttpblogs.infosupport.comaddingassembliestothegacinwindowsazure relnofollowthese instructionsa regarding how to install a DLL into the GAC as an azure startup task. Everything works as long as I have the gacutil and the related .cmd file in the root of the web role project. However, I want to move this into the apps startup folder where I have other startup commands.p  pSo far I have been unable to get this to work. gacutil isnt very helpful either as I have not been able to get it to show any output after I run commands against it.

Negative 99 pFrom my understanding, codecakephpcode doesnt support database inheritance relationship.

For example, seller may have inventoryid while customer may have something like deliveryaddress, etc. p  pI have been thinking of creating a workaround to this problem without destroying codecakephpcode convention. I was going to create three additional foreign keys, codeadminidcode, codeselleridcode and codecustomeridcode, inside User table, which links to other table.

Negative 99 pAs I determined in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma14176911340947this topica, the codetouchmovecode event is liable to be sent in batches depending on the combination of elements being touched. p  pIf I have three fingers each touching a different element, but I still want to be able to process the motion of all three fingers together for example to define an interaction on a common parent of these 3 elements, I would basically have to consolidate the data coming out of the touch events which are likely to be issued in clumps of three codetouchmovecode events for each device input sample. p  pWhile a simple workaround is to just make one big covering element and handle it the usual way, I intend to go after the holy grail of wrapping complex manipulations on complex DOM structures in a simpletodeploy piece of code. p  pAs such it is clear that I want to either use the data out of codetouchescode list within the lastinbound codetouchmovecode, or collect the contents of codechangedTouchescode of each codetouchmovecode. I have currently been writing a routine which tracks the identifiers of touches and once it sees one repeated it will know at that point that were looking at the first codetouchmovecode out of the next group the next input tick. p  pThis is clearly suboptimal because I have now introduced an up to 16ms delay on processing the input. p  pI did come up with something that could work If the events are sent in in the order that the touch codeidentifierscode are in, then when I am processing the codechangedTouchescode list which ends with the touch corresponding to the highestnumbered codeidentifiercode created and I know this from the codetouchstartcode event, then that would be sufficient to indicate that I have received through the codetouchmovescode so far all of the info for the current timestep from the hardware. p  pUpdate What I have implemented is a variable that tracks emoneem of the fingers and once it sees that finger in a codetouchmovecode codechangedTouchescode, it goes and runs a loop that processes all values in codetouchescode. This completely fails to provide the correct information. The one touch that it checks against might not move, and in that case no codechangedTouchescode is produced for it. p  pWhat other things could I dop

I have a table in my database that I needed to be able to add additional columns to.  Ive done this using the following queryp  precodesql  ALTER TABLE tablename ADD columnname INT11  Run the query.... codepre  pThis worked perfect on day one, however on day two when I tried to add an additional column via this php script, it appears to work from the phpMyAdmin Structure view.  The column is in there with the correct columnname and datatype.  However when I switch to the Browse view, there is no Column Name, just blank columns filled with null values.  But, if you click on an individual row, it shows the correct column name, and a value if one exists for that row.p  pIve tried running Analyze Table, as I read somewhere that that would update the Schema.  However, I havent had any success with that fixing it.  Id prefer to not have to delete the table and restart, especially if I run into this issue again.  As this is my first post, Ive tried to format everything correctly, but please forgive me if I didnt.  Also, I can grab screenshots if anyone is having issues understanding my question.p

Negative 99 pTo begin, I have spent the last few hours browsing stackoverflow on related topics. Many of them seemed very similar to the issue Im having, there was even a couple that resembled mine almost perfectly. However, the fixes that worked for them do not seem to be working for me.

Negative 99 pCredit to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comusers45091dfowlerdfowleras excellent Jabbr project, I am borrowing code to embed linked content from user posts. The code is from a hrefhttpsgithub.comJabbRJabbRblobmasterJabbRInfrastructureUrlExtractor.cs relnofollowherea and uses a regex to extract URLs for additional processing and embedding.p  pIn my case, I run the user posts through a markdown processor first, before attempting this embed. The markdown processor MarkdownDeep will, if the user formats the markdown correctly, transform any given image markdown into valid HTML img tag. That works great, however, using the embedded content providers will make the image appear twice, since it shows up validly from the markdown transform, then gets embedded as well afterwards. p  pSo, I believe the solution to my problem lies in changing the regex to not match when the found URL is already contained within a valid img tag. p  pFor ease of answering the regex so far is p  precodeib[az][w]1,3[az09]wwwd0,3[.][az09.][.][az]2,4[sltgt][sltgt][sltgt][sltgt][sltgt][s[].,ltgt] codepre  pI think I want to use negative lookahead like in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2078915aregularexpressiontoexcludeawordstringthis answera to exclude the img, but Im too poor at regex syntax to implement it myself. p  pNOTE I want it to still match images if they just appear in the text. So codehttpwww.example.comsitesdefaultfilesDellComputer.jpgcode would match  or in a hyperlink codelta hrefhttpwww.example.comsitesdefaultfilesDellComputer.jpggtcode would match but codeltimg srchttpwww.example.comsitesdefaultfilesDellComputer.jpggtcode would not. p  pThanks for the help, I know some of you have savantlevel regex talents, I just never could do them. p

But Im guessing this is not possible.p  pIs there any other easy way to add alternate resources to the existing projectp

This class is referenced by the method codegetTweetsByQueryObjcode in class codecom.frrole.service.common.Citycode. Hence, somewhere while executing this method, tomcat is unable to locate OAuthUtil class. The OAuthUtil class has proper package statement defined in its code. The application also compiles successfully otherwise ws.war would not have been produced.p  pThe confusing part is that codeOAuthUtilcode class is in same package and directory as codeCitycode class.

Negative 99 pThere are many questions on StackOverflow regarding similar topic. In fact, Ive already managed to get a basic dialog to popup in one of my controllers which is part of a Model.p  pHowever, I seem to have problems to get Ajax popup form to work when I try to fire it from a controller i.e. one that is NOT part of a Model.p  pI have a view called maindisplay.html.erb. A snippet of the code is shown below. It basically has a collection of photos which Im rendering in a partial.p  precode    lt render partial gt photo, collection gt photos gt codepre  pThe partial main photo.html.erb looks like this just a snippetp  precode    lttdgt         lt photo.title gtltbrgt         lt imagetagphoto.url gtltbrgt         ltdiv idmediaform titleAdd Item to Selected Trip and Trip Item gt             lt render partial gt modal, locals photo photo gt         ltdivgt     lttdgt codepre  pIm already anticipating criticism on a partial within a partial but not exactly sure why thats bad...but heck, it works.p  pThe partial form within the partial photo above is main modal.html.erb looks something like thisp  precode    lt formtagcontroller gt media, action gt create, method gt post do  gt             lt labeltagmiid, Enter Media Item ID gt         lt textfieldtagmiid gt         lt hiddenfieldtag url, photo.url gt         lt submittagAdd to Album   gt     lt end gt codepre  pI obviously then have a Model called Media which has an action create than would add the photo url into the database.p  pNone of the above has any ajax or JQuery at the moment. Ive played around with it before but none of it works. Ideally, I want to have a button or link in the partial main photo.html.erb which would trigger the modal form as a popup...the modal form would be the one in main modal.html.erb. The form would then have allow me to added data to the Media Model. Once added, the popup form closes and stay on the original maindisplay.html.erb page which has all the search results of photos without refreshing the page.p  pMy main confusions are 1 where should I put the .js.erb file which contains all the jQuery stuff In the viewsmain folder or the viewsmedia folder Or neitherp  p2 If I want to have a button or link to trigger the popup form, do I need to create an action in the main controller Is this where I put the format.js code to trigger the javascript Ive tried that already and Rails seems to have a problem recognising the format.js when I use it in a Controller which is not part of a Model.p  p3 Where should the remote  true go Should it be in the button which triggers the form or should it be in the form or bothp  p4 If someone can show me some basic code on to get a basic popup form up and running in the .js.erb file then that would be much appreciated.p  p5 More of a general question  when is it good practice to put the javascript in application.jsp  pIm sure you can tell from my question that Im not really much of a coder and new to the ajax world but everyones gotta start somewhere, right p
Negative 99 pheres what im doingp  pstrongdlstrong folder contains a variety of mp3 music albums archives in zip format. For this example, lets say i have an archive called somealbum.zip and inside the zip file there is a file called somesong.mp3p  pstrongplaylist.phpstrong will get the list of mp3 files inside a zip archive then build a XML file to use as playlist with a flash mp3 player. For each mp3 entry in the xml file, it returns a filename value like thisp  precodeltlocationgtmp3.phpfilesomealbum.zipsomesong.mp3ltlocationgt codepre  pstrongmp3.phpstrong will read the file inside the zip archive without extracting it using zipsomealbum.zipsomesong.mp3 then it will output the content with mp3 headers. So when i go to mp3.phpfilesomealbum.zipsomesong.mp3 it will stream the mp3 file just like it was a real file.p  pstrongplayer.htmlstrong is just a flash mp3 player that will stream the album using playlist.php XML file.p  pstrongThe problemstrong is that the flash player will only play the first 2 songs no matter what i try. It looks like the server cant open more than 2 files at same time or a maximum of X megabytes.p  pI triplechecked that all mp3 filenames are correct inside the XML playlist and if i manually launch the mp3 URL in my browser it will work perfectly. The mp3 player also detects the mp3 length which confirms the filename is good.p  pI have also tried with 3 different mp3 players and all of them have the same problem  i am only able to play the first 2 songs.  So my question is could it be a setting on my dedicated server that prevent me from reading more than 2 files at same time inside the zip archive p  pExample flash player a hrefhttpwww.piratepunk.complayertest.html relnofollowhttpwww.piratepunk.complayertest.htmlap  pusing this XML playlist generated from php with content of a zip archive a hrefhttpwww.piratepunk.comODYgQ3JldyAtIDIwMDAgLSBCYWQgQmFkIFJlZ2dhZS56aXA.xml relnofollowhttpwww.piratepunk.comODYgQ3JldyAtIDIwMDAgLSBCYWQgQmFkIFJlZ2dhZS56aXA.xmlap

Negative 99 pI have a strange issue where my normals just do not work when I render terrain.  My terrain renders just fine, so I left out all the code for calculating the terrain points from a height map and how I calculated the indices.

Negative 99 pThis question is related to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq18124048341971Which API Microsoft Word Office 2013 is using the paint the screena, which was left unanswered.p  pI have an Office plugin native C which is fairly involving with Office. Using hooks Im modifying the client area of Office application.p  pThings were working great for me up to Office 2010, hooking WMNCPAINT, and using GDI method on the Office Window.p  pBut Office 2013 uses Direct2D, DXGI, and DirectWrite. On Windows 7, if I draw something on the screen  it gets erased the next time the cursor blink. On Windows 8  I dont even have access to the screen.p  pCurrently, my thinking is to hook codeID2D1DeviceContextBeginDrawcode, codeID2D1DeviceContextEndDrawcode  and on last function, just before delegating to the real function, I will add my stuff. Another idea is the hook codeIDXGISwapChain1Present1code. Problem with both these methods that Ive hard time identifying what is going on above.p  pIm even thinking even a different process or GDI based window  if possible on top of the client area I want to decorate, with the majority of the real eastate being 100 transparent. Problem with this solution are issues like keyboard focus and mouse click.p  pAny tip or suggestion will be appreciated. Any tool the Spy for DirectX will be appreciated. Does DirectX specifically Direct2D has documented extensible or plugable story, Im not aware of and could use Is there anything in Kernel Mode Im missingp

Negative 99 pI am currently trying to decide on best way to send data across from a PHP script to a Python script. But please keep reading as I have already looked at existing posts on the subject. Currently I am doing the following as suggested by one of the posts I have readp  precodeExample .php var1  2 tmp  execvarwww Example.py var1 echo tmp  Example.py import sys print sys.argv[1] codepre  pThis seems to be working ok. Although it is in the really early stages.  Ultimately the PHP script will be sending over a reasonable amount of data generated from an HTML form so I wondered if it was the most efficient way of sending it. p  pThe PHP, HTML and the Python scripts are running on a a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiRaspberryPi relnofollowcodeRaspberry Picodea which is connected via a wired LAN to a laptop. p  pUltimately I am going to have to use TCPIP to read various commands from another desktop that will be sending them out via TCPIP I cant change this so I wondered whether it was better to initialize sockets now and then use this method to also send the data from the PHP script to Python. p  pI am quite new to this range of languages so I am only looking for advice so that I can then investigate further. I have looked at various other posts but none seem to match what I am trying to do.p
Negative 99 pIm trying to use jQuerys codeslidetogglecode function. Here is the jQuery codep  precodedocument.readyfunction     parent.clickfunction         child.slideToggleslow       codepre  pIt works perfectly fine in Chrome and Firefox, though it has problems in IE. Normally, codeslidetogglecode toggles the css field display from codenonecode to codeinlinecode and visaversa. In IE, it seems that when codeslideTogglecode is called, it toggles it codeinlinecode, but a split second later, it turns display back to codenonecode Im guessing. It does it so quickly that it doesnt even display the text from the codedivcode codechildcode.p  pEDIT1 I had the idea that IE may be clicking the parent an extra time, but after debugging, that wasnt the case.p  pEDIT2 I tried using codejQuery.slideTogglecode in a place page since the page Im developing on is complex, and it works fine.

Negative 99 pVBA newbie here.  I searched the responses, but I couldnt find anything useful.  I have a chart in an Excel tab.  I want the Y axis of the chart to dynamically update based on parameters I pass in, so I wrote a simple macro to do so in a VBA module I have a series with zeros after a certain date in the chart, so I cant just let Excel pick an automatic axis.   The macro works fine when I call it manually e.g., through a button, but I want it to be invoked every time the user selects the Fill Strategy or Report tabs.  Im using the WorksheetActivate code see below, but I get stuck in an infinite loop due to the SheetsFill Strategy.Select and SheetsReport.Select potions of the UpdateChartAxes macro which essentially calls my WorksheetActivate code again and again.  How do I fix this issue  Is there a way to redesign the UpdateChartAxes code so that it doesnt need the select statements  Any help would be appreciated.p  pstrongCode in the Fill Strategy and Report tab modulesstrongp  precodePrivate Sub WorksheetActivate Call UpdateChartAxes End Sub codepre  pstrongCode in an open modulestrongp  precodePublic Sub UpdateChartAxes Application.ScreenUpdating  False Call ShowSheets  WorkforceReportChart     Dim WorkforceReportChartMin As Long     Dim WorkforceReportChartMax As Long     SheetsChart Data.Select     WorkforceReportChartMin  WorksheetFunction.minRangeReportGraphDataRangeExcludingHistoricSeries  0.95     WorkforceReportChartMax  WorksheetFunction.MaxRangeReportGraphDataRangeExcludingHistoricSeries  1.05     SheetsReport.Select     With ActiveSheet.ChartObjectsWorkforceReportChart.Chart         With .AxesxlValue             .MinimumScale  WorkforceReportChartMin             .MaximumScale  WorkforceReportChartMax         End With     End With  FillStrategyChart     Dim FillStrategyChartMin As Long     Dim FillStrategyChartMax As Long     SheetsChart Data.Select     FillStrategyChartMin  WorksheetFunction.minRangeFillStrategyGraphDataRangeExcludingHistoricSeries  0.95     FillStrategyChartMax  WorksheetFunction.MaxRangeFillStrategyGraphDataRangeExcludingHistoricSeries  1.05     SheetsFill Strategy.Select     With ActiveSheet.ChartObjectsFillStrategyChart.Chart         With .AxesxlValue             .MinimumScale  FillStrategyChartMin             .MaximumScale  FillStrategyChartMax         End With     End With  Call HideSheets End Sub codepre

Negative 99 pI regularly interact with massive OLAP based Pivot Tables. Usually these are more or less undocumented. And thus they are difficult to really wrap my head around and use effectively.p  pOne of my strategies for learning what data is being presented is to mouseover a field in the pivot table field list and then pressing the down arrow to see a emdistinctem list of the values within the option. See image below.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comjIDZZ.png altYou cant see my mouse, but its clicking op  pI thought Woah, maybe I can write some VBA to do this for me and I can generate a list of unique values in the cube so I can quickly scansearch for what I am looking for.p  pNow, Im reasonably adept at VBA, but I just cant seem to get it. I am guessing that the method that I need doesnt exist. However, I thought Id try here.p  pFirst attemptp  precodeSub listcubefields Set objNewSheet  Worksheets.Add objNewSheet.Activate intRow  1 For Each objCubeFld In WorksheetsSheet1.PivotTables1.CubeFields     objNewSheet.CellsintRow, 1.Value  objCubeFld.Name     intRow  intRow  1 Next objCubeFld End Sub codepre  pThis generates a list of all of the available pivot table fields which can actually be sort of useful, but there doesnt seem to be a way to get the childrenleafsdescendants of a codeCubefieldcodep  pNext I triedp  precodeSub testfieldlist Worksheetssheet4.Activate With Worksheetssheet1.PivotTables1     c  1     For i  1 To .PivotFields.Count         r  1         Cellsr, c  .PivotFieldsi.Name         r  r  1         For X  1 To .PivotFieldsi.PivotItems.Count             name1  .PivotFieldsi.PivotItemsX.Name             cleans up name by eliminating the hierarchy labels             splitName  Splitname1, amp             Cellsr, c  splitName2             r  r  1         Next         c  c  1     Next End With End Sub codepre  pThis gets a list of all of the unique values that I have emusedem in the pivot table, but doesnt even touch unused fields. Similarly, this can be sort of helpful, but it isnt quite there.p  pWhat I really need is a little bit of each to suit my fancy, again, I dont think the methods exist. I do understand that what Im asking might be computationally expensive and likely quite slow and that Im not using the right tools for the task at hand. OLAP respects [the application] permissions, while giving [me] direct SQL access would not is my IT depts excuse.p  pAnyway, if you have any ideas, Im all ears.p  pThanks Tomp
Negative 99 pI am new to WPF and the MVVM design pattern. Consequently, everything I try to do seems to take a long time. p  pCurrently I am using a combobox to select a list.

Negative 99 pThe picture shows exactly what the problem is. Ads are being overshadowed by the UITableView. I followed the SplitNavigationBanner project provided by apple and changed it so I can switch between navigation controllers and split view controllers within the app.p  pThe setup is this  1st VC that loads is a navigation view. Ads are hidden but loaded. I then switch over to the Split VC and have ads shown. The result is the picture below.p  pMore Info  I printed all the sizes and everything matches up. In other words, the split view controller and master view controller within it are exactly the same height. Yet its clear there is a shadow over the ads. If ads are loaded AFTER the split VC is shown to screen, there is no problem with ads. Everything lines up at that point. This issue does not occur if the master view controller is a tab view controller. p  pAny thoughts what would cause the shadow over the banner ads Maybe its the way the subviews are loadedimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comOGuIZ.png altenter image description herep

Negative 99 pI have a library based on NumPy with a few classes that overload the arithmetic operations.  The internals are a little hairy due to a significant amount of error checking, but Ive run across a serious problem with how Im doing it.p  pThe idea behind the library is to make it very easy and intuitive to use with minimal syntax and effort by the programmer.  As such, I want it to be easy to combine arrays of different data types and simply convert the narrower data type to the wider case.p  pFor example, if I have two arrays, one with dtype codefloat64code and the other with dtype codecomplex128code, when adding them together I would like to convert the codefloat64code to codecomplex128code, but if its codefloat64code and codecomplex192code, I want to convert to that instead.  However, if it was a combination of codefloat64code and codecomplex64code, there isnt a valid conversion between the two without losing precision of the codefloat64code, so I would want to convert both to codecomplex128code.p  pI immediately saw the problem that I would have to look for each combination of types and determine their narrowest common widened type think least common multiple if I wanted my library to be fully robust.  I emdontem want to convert everything to the widest type possible, since that becomes memory inefficient very quickly, and I often have very large arrays stored in memory.p  pstrongIs there a good way to determine the narrowest common widened type between two NumPy typesstrongp

During early parts of the book, the author has below para. I am confused with the sentence in strongembold and italicsemstrong below. p  pWhat is the purpose behind running multiple instances of SQL server on a given server It seems that SQL server is a very costly software, in such case isnt installing multiple instances a costly taskp  blockquote   pThe Database Engine sits at the core of the SQL Server components. The engine operates as a service on a machine, which is often referred to as an instance of SQL Server. strongemYou can run multiple instances of SQL Server on a given server.emstrong When you connect to SQL Server, the instance is the target of the connection. Once an application is connected, it sends TransactSQL TSQL statements to the instance. The instance in return sends data back to the client. Within the connection is a security layer that validates access to the data as specified by the database administrators DBAs. The Database Engine enables you to leverage the full capabilities of all of the other components, such as accessing, storing, and securing the data..p blockquote

Negative 99 pIve recently starting to learn how to code and Ive been using my MacBook Air 13, w osx 10.9. p  pAt first I learned not to use my trackpad, better to instead CommandTab between my various apps, which greatly increased my productivity. p  pNext I started threefinger swiping or pressing control amp leftright between desktops that way I could fullscreen Sublime, Terminal, a pdf, etc.... another great productivity boost. p  pPerhaps I am getting faster at typing and thinking about code, but I recently found that when I swipe between desktops there is a slight lag. For example, swiping between sublime and terminal will result in some text in sublime then the remainder in terminal if you do it relatively quickly. It is only maybe a one second delay, but this does slow me down when I have the Hartl Tutorial, Sublime and Terminal all open on different desktops and I am moving between them a lot as I am doing now.p  pI assume that disabling the animation which occurs when moving between desktops will allow me to start typing code earlier on the destination desktop... so if anyone can point me in the right direction on how to disable that animation it would be appreciatedp

Negative 99 pI know that web audio api can take an codeltaudiogtcode element as its media source, for frequency data, etc, however SoundManager2 does not seem to create an codeltaudiogtcode tag, and as such Im not sure what I would provide as the source, in order to play sounds using SoundManager2, and use that as a source to provide visualizations using web audio.p  pThe reason for the split is because SoundManager2 is well documented and can relay information such as bytes loaded, schedule events at certain times in audio, and other such things that either dont yet exist or are simply hard to find out about in the web audio api.

Negative 99 pI suspect this is a silly question, but here goes...p  pI have two fields on a custom control, both are bound to managed bean properties as opposed to document fields. The second field is only rendered when a specific value is chosen in the first field.p  pWhat I am seeing is that the setter for the second field is not firing after it has been rendered the getter is firing just fine.p  pI have worked around the problem by computing the CSS display property on the second field to be block or none depending on the value in the first field.

Negative 99 pI am in the process of refreshingrewriting a data analysis application I wrote a couple of years back. What I am trying to achieve is as follows p  ul liI need to have a lightweight database to do queries to, I decided on using HSQLDB.li liI will have 2 applications one for creating the DB and one that will do the analysis will be used by others. It is my intention that the analysis software which is multithreaded will use the DB in a readonly fashionli liThe DB will likely be distributed via FTP, and preferably with minimum hassle for the user of the analysis software most of which are not very technically skilled. li ul  pI am not very wellread on SQL but I managed to get the info into tables and tried out simple queries. So in order to finish the database creator application I just need to figure out how to package the DB.p  pI have experimented both with emmemem and emfileem catalogs a hrefhttphsqldb.orgdoc2.0guiderunningchapt.htmlrgchsqldbdb relnofollowas described in the HSQLDB user guidea when I generate the DB. The way I see it, with emmemem catalogs I cannot write them to disk to distribute later on and with emfileem catalogs I have several files that need to be taken care of p  blockquote   pA file catalog consists of between 2 to 6 files, all named the same   but with different extensions, located in the same directory. For   example, the database named test consists of the following filesp      p test.propertiesp      p test.scriptp      p test.logp      p test.datap      p test.backupp      p test.lobsp      pThe properties file contains a few settings about the database. The script file contains the definition of tables and other database objects, plus the data for noncached tables. The log file contains   recent changes to the database. The data file contains the data for   cached tables and the backup file is a compressed backup of the last   known consistent state       of the data file. All these files are essential and should never be deleted. For some catalogs, the test.data and test.backup files   will not be present. In addition to those files, a HyperSQL database   may link to any formatted text files, such as CSV lists, anywhere on   the disk.p blockquote  pstrongQuestionsstrong p  ol lipI think the code.scriptcode and code.propertiescode files are the most important ones but the guide specifically says that all the files are essential and should not be deleted. Since there is no code.datacode file in my case, and all the data to generate my database is stored in code.scriptcode file in clear text it makes me think that when I open that file, the JVM recreates the entire DB all over again. Is this correct Isnt this a very inefficient representation of datapli lipIf my understanding in 1 is correct, why are the other files essential Do I have to distribute them all pli lipIf 1 and 2 are not offtrack, then what options do I have to achieve my goal Is it for instance feasible to gzip all the files and transport them that way Then my analysis software would need to unpack them in a reasonable spot, and do a cleanup from time to time when it gets crowded in there... pli ol

Negative 99 pI have a nice .net assembly of core matlab functions, created of course with the matlab compiler. For functions that accept numbers or arrays of numbers, this is fine I can write code in c without having to revert to matlab well, the RCM has to be installed thats fine.p  pFor functions that must reference other functions, however, the only way I can find so far to get a c programme going is to compile both functions into the assembly. To explain better, lets say I have a library in which Ive stored the ode45 routine. If I want to solve a specific equation, lets say something simple like dydx  y, then I have to create a matlab script file which may be written as followsp  precodefunction dydx  diffeqx, y dydx  y codepre  p[obviously the analytical solution exists, but for the sake of this example lets say I want to solve it this way]p  pNow in order to solve this equation, I would have to add this function as a method in my class to be compiled into the .net assembly. This of course ruins the generality of my library I want applicationspecific equations in a different library to my core math function library. That is, the ODE45 method should reside in a more core library than the library in which the diffeq method would reside.p  pMore than that, I would much prefer to create the diffeq method in a c class that I can edit directly in e.g. VS2012. I would like to edit the equation directly rather than having to enter matlab each time and recompile an assembly.p  pTo solve this problem, I have gone to the extent of decompiling the assembly which contains both the ode45 code and my differential equation method it turns out the assembly is nothing but an interface to the MCR the diffeq methods in the assembly return something like the followingp  precodereturn mcr.EvaluateFunctionnumArgsOut, diffeq, new object[0] codepre  pWe note that the functionmethod diffeq is not part of the MCR MCR does not change. However, I cant find the equation anywhere in the assembly. p  pWhich begs the question Dude, wheres my functionp  pThere is a resources component of the assembly in which we find [classname].ctf, and in that well find some machine code. This looks encrypted, but the equation might be hidden in there. If so, that would be a deliberate attempt to prevent when I am attempting, and kudos to MathWorks for making it impossible for me to avoid having to enter the matlab application p  pHowever, there doesnt seem to be anything in licensing to prevent what I want to do I think it would be great if mathworks would allow as open an approach as that, but in the interrim, does anyone know how to do thisp

Negative 99 pIve a ListView screen that is driving me mad.p  pEach row has three TextViews. The adapter is a custom ArrayAdapter that makes use of the view recycling mechanism if the row is first requested, a new view is inflated, otherwise the recycled view is used. Everything works ok. Im not showing it but for now assume it is correctly implemented.p  pThis is how it looks normallyp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comhJdZX.png altenter image description herep  pThere is a search button in the right upper corner of the screen. When clicked, every text view in the list is cleared Ive debugged the code and the textviews are there, the text is set and everything is ok except the text is barely or not shown. Heres a view dump taken with DDMSp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comokZ4m.png altenter image description herep  pLooks like only the first letters of the text are shown. This only happens in certain devices, and only when the adapters codegetViewcode method returns the recycled view for the row, BUT only after pressing the search button, which makes the keyboard to show up If i close it, the text is still missing. If I modify the codegetViewcode method to always inflate every row this does not happen, but of course this is not an option since my list should be able to handle a large number of items. p  pLooks like a bug, but I need to do something about it.p  pIve also tested an alternative recycling mechanism based on a map basically I put the view for each row in a map. Still the behavior is observed.p  pDevice is a Samsung Galaxy SII running 4.1.2. Not happening in Galaxy SIII mini for instance.p  pDo you know what could be causing this glitch Something related to the TextViews widthp  pThanks in advancep

The data is supposed to be scattered togathered from the clients columnwise.p  pWhat I am doing at the moment is to map the 2dimensional arrays which are in fact subarrays of 3dimensional ones into statically allocated 1dimensional arrays, send these 1dim. arrays via MPI and then rebuild the 2dimensional arrays again at the receiver.

Negative 99 pI have two versions of almost similar code. One works but other doesnt. I think I am missing some conceptual detail in this. It would be great if someone can point out the error.p  pThe following code does not work. It just loads a white page.

Negative 99 pAfter I updated my 4S to iOS 7.1 my wifi suddenly stopped working, which is okay since I like the challenge of optimizing my apps performance. However, Ive also noticed that iBeacon ranging may not be working properly as strongthe proximity is always reported as CLProximityUnknown and the RSSI value is always zerostrong. Just to clarify, the UUID, major and minor are being read as expected. Its just the proximity functionality that appears to be misfiring.p  pGiven that my wifi stopped working, perhaps my 4Ss hardware is simply failing. That being said, has anyone else seen this issuep  pThis is important because my app ignores iBeacons whose proximity is unknown. I may just get rid of this check though. strongDoes anyone know if CLProximityUnknown mean the beacon is further away than CLProximityFar Or does it simply just mean it wasnt able to determine the beacons proximitystrongp  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pIts my 4S which is kind of a relief.

Negative 99 pThe usual way of using jquery deferred.resolve method is by calling it when you have a callback function which gives you a response that they are fully loaded, as in this case the xhr add an event listener when it is loaded and provides the xhr response to deferred.resolve.p  pThe following code is copied from one of the example. a hrefhttpwww.danieldemmel.meblog20130322anintroductiontojquerydeferredslashpromise relnofollowhttpwww.danieldemmel.meblog20130322anintroductiontojquerydeferredslashpromiseap  precodefunction getData         var deferred  .Deferred              XMLHttpRequest xhr  new XMLHttpRequest   xhr.openGET,data,true               xhr.addEventListenerload,function     ifxhr.status  200                 deferred.resolvexhr.response     else                 deferred.rejectHTTP error   xhr.status        ,false                xhr.send   return deferred.promise  codepre  pMy current code which retrieves data using Marionette requestresponse handler.

Negative 99 pI am working at a C application with ncurses for a CLI that uses autotools for build. Besides the actual application, there is a testing framework cutter and there are some preprocessor constants that enable or disable some features for example, there is a constant WINDOW that borders all ncurses windows  useful for managing the window layout.p  pOf course, some of these constants can be specified manually at compile time i.e. make but Id like to have 2 build targets debug and release. Also, there is a problem with cutter configure checks for it, and this is supposed to happen if its going to be used, but I cannot require a normal user to install cutter to compile. So, I was thinking at the following setup to create a configure flag that enables tests disabled by default and 2 make targets make creates the release version and make debug, the debug one. Is this workflow correct or there is a better way to do thisp

Negative 99 pAccording to what I know about browsers algorithm of CSS processing, selector codepcode has less perfomance impact than codepcode, doesnt it p  pSo, in the codepcode browser scans through all elements on the page, and those that follow codepcode are applied a corresponding rule. In the codepcode firstly it looks only for codepcode, but does it stop the search immediateliy after finding some element before codepcode, thus making less search iterations Or codecode still scans here everything.p  pAlso, which tools can show CSS loading time and other heavyweight information. Found only those that search for unused or excess rules and compress the CSS for getting less size.p  pIn context  I need to apply topmargin to any element that follows codepcode except codeppcode, the content is generated dynamically.

Negative 99 pIm currently working as an intern in a medium sized company. My main job was to work on a Java application that relied strongly on MS Access databases with some 150 tables and 200 queries.

The problem is the way they are designed a lot of them take multiple table columns, join them with columns taken from SELECT queries... and then are used within another query where the same repeats  creating messy and difficult to convert chains and another problem is that I had no previous experience with databases and finding resources to help me in my struggle is near impossible. No books about SQL help as I think my problems are too specific.p  pSo Im addressing you to help me find best course of action. I thought of these possible scenariosp  ul liI go on, possibly creating some monstrosities of SQL functions and procedures, and it probably will WERKli liExplain to my supervisor that it is not feasible to continue with the full migration.

Can some body educate me more on this in terms of isolation etc . what actually happens if we do or dont use transaction in the above scenariop  pemWorking nontransactionally with Hibernate Look at the following code, which accesses the database without transaction boundariesemp  precodeSession session  sessionFactory.openSession    session.getItem.class, 123l    session.close    codepre  pemBy default, in a Java SE environment with a JDBC configuration, this is what happens if you execute this snippet 1. A new Session is opened. It doesnt obtain a database connection at this point. 2. The call to get triggers an SQL SELECT. The Session now obtains a JDBC Connection from the connection pool. Hibernate, by default, immediately turns off the autocommit mode on this connection with setAutoCommitfalse. This effectively starts a JDBC transaction 3. The SELECT is executed inside this JDBC transaction. The Session is closed, and the connection is returned to the pool and released by Hibernate  Hibernate calls close on the JDBC Connection. What happens to the uncommitted transaction   The answer to that question is, It depends The JDBC specification doesnt say anything about pending transactions when close is called on a connection. What happens depends on how the vendors implement the specification. With Oracle JDBC drivers, for example, the call to close commits the transaction Most other JDBC vendors take the sane route and roll back any pending transaction when the JDBC Connection object is closed and the resource is returned to the pool. Obviously, this wont be a problem for the SELECT youve executed, but look at this variationemp

Negative 99 pIn my Rails 3.2 app there are two Devise models User and Admin. I have a comment partial form that both can use to make comments on a Post.

Form checkbox codep  precode if adminsignedin   .pullright      labeltag internal, Private      f.checkbox internal codepre  pIts not a huge issue because it should never occur in production, but in development and staging Ive noticed that if someone tester, etc is logged in as both an Admin and a User in different tabs on the same browser, the logic of my form doesnt work because I guess those two tabs are using the same cookiesession infowhatever. The checkbox shows up on the Users form because the Admin is signed in on the other tab. It works fine if two different browsers are being used.p  pIs there a way to avoid thisp

Negative 99 pI have a server application written in C. When a client connects, it creates a new thread for him. In that thread there is a BLOCKING reading from a socket. Because there is a possibility for a client to accidentally disconnect and left behind a thread still hanging on the read function, there is a thread that checks if the sockets are still alive by sending heartbeat messages. The message consists of 1 character and is ignored by the client it is not processed like other messages. The write looks like thisp  precodewritefd, , 1 codepre  pIt works fine, but is it really necessary to send a random character through the socket I tried to send an empty message  with length 0, but it didnt work.

Negative 99 pIm looking for the best method to wait for async tasks to finish in rxjava.p  pAs a common example say there is a function which gets a list of ids from a local store and then queries a remote system for those Ids, the remote system results are then consolidated into a single report and returned to the caller of the function. As the call to the remote system is slow we want them to be done in asynchronously and I only want to return once all of the calls have returned and their results have been processed. p  pThe only reliable way I have found to do this is to poll the subscription to check it is unsubscribed yet.

Negative 99 pin my Joomla template is of course the component included p  precodeltjdocinclude typecomponent gt codepre  pThat fills the whole width of the parent container at the moment with margins. The parent container has a background that stretches from the top of the site to the bottom of the component. What I want to do is add a position after the component to place a module there, but I want it next to the component. p  pBut once I make the component codefloatleftcode and add a codewidth80code or something so the module on the new position will float next to the component. But, the background from the parent container changes when I add a width other than 100 to the component and stops before the component begins.p  pHow can I have the component have a smaller width than 100 and codefloatleftcode with another position next to it without changing the background of the parent containerp  pEdit I like to add that I cannot use codeoverflowhiddencode on the parent container since another element will be clipped if I do. Adding a background to component and the other position wont work either since the original background is wider.p  pEdit2 I found a solution to my problem. For future reference if anyone is interested the float clearing part on a hrefhttpcsstricks.comthecssoverflowproperty relnofollowthisa page described my problem and clearing the float by adding a codeltdiv styleclear bothgtltdivgtcode after the last floating element solved my problem. If anyone has a cleaner, better solution I love to see itp

Negative 99 pI try to establish a SSL Client authentication with a PKCS11 Card under Android. I can read the Certificate fine, but sadly i cant extract the private key, so i cant use it to create my KeyStore. Since i dont get any Lib from the vendor and cant use the SUN implementation of PKCS11, since that is not supported by android, i guess i have to override the SSLContext to change the way it handles the signing process, so i can encrypt and decrypt the Handshake via the cardp  pAlso i cant use the full PKCS11 API i got following methodsp  blockquote   pCKRV CGenerateKeyPairp      pCKRV CGenerateRandomp      pCKRV CDecryptp      pCKRV CSignp      pCKRV CEncryptp blockquote  pThe login to the Card is handled beforehand by a different Software, so i already have access.p  pSo basically two questionsp  ol lipIs there an easy way to handle the authentification without access to the private keypli lipWhat or Where do i have to override to handle the SSL signing via the cardpli ol
Negative 99 pI am trying to solve a differential equation with the ode solver ode45 with MATLAB. I have tried using it with other simpler functions and let it plot the function.

Negative 99 pI have written some vbacode to copy slides from one presentation to another. I activate the SourcePresentation and copy a slide. Then I switch to the DestinationPresentation and do a PasteSpecial. When the file is done I save the DestinationPresentation and close it. The Source is closed as well.  Then I loop to the next file and open both Source and Destination. Now this works fine with two or three files. Then the code stucks. The reason I fund while debuging the code, the activating of the DestinationPresentation suddenly not working anymore Any ideas whats happening Im working with PPT 2010 and Win 7. Any hint would be highly appreciated Best Regards Hansp  pTimWilliams Hi Tim, following the part of the code that gives me problems.  It seems, that the difficulty is the swithch from source to destination. The switch from destination to source always worked. Actually I wrote the macro to get across the limitations of the PPTHandout format, where pictures are usually too small and you cant position them to be leftoriented and rightoriented to have a good doublesided printout. This macro is basically based on the SlideCopyExample by Microsoft which inspired me to try it.p  pWith the Do..Loop I start to open the sourcefiles, then the destinationfile. I run the code from a seperate empty presentation, just containing the code. So in total I will have 3 presentations running. This is just the part of the code that gives me problems. The total code is a bit big, as I do quite some formating, you can imagine. Anyway  thanks a lot for your interest Hansp  precodeFor x  1 To SourceSlides                   Loop through all the slides of Source and  ActivePresentation.Slides.RangeArrayx.Select ActivePresentation.Slides.RangeArrayx.Copy  Select the first slide in the presentation and copy it.

Many manuals I read such as a hrefhttpsdocs.djangoproject.comen1.6refcontribcsrf relnofollowDjangoas or a hrefhttpwords.weareloring.comdevelopmentlaravellaravel4csrftokenswhenusingjquerysajax relnofollowLaravelas send codecsrftokencode in modifying Ajax requests, such as POST, PUT or DELETE, either in headers or in body.p  pWhat I dont understand is the very purpose of using codecsrftokencode with nonCORS Ajax requests. If Im not allowing CORS requests on my server no AccessControlAllowOrigin CORS header and check ORIGIN header on all Ajax requests, coming to the server side to correspond to my domain. Do I need codecsrftokencode at all in such casep  pCould you write a scenario of attack that can be successfully performed against me if Im not sending and checking csrftoken for my Ajax requestsp

Negative 99 pIm trying to align two to three buttons horizontally in a view. For simplicity, Ill show my attempt of aligning two buttons.p  pThis works for buttons that have a short titlep  precodeH10[questionButton1questionButton2]5[questionButton2]10 codepre  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comcV9yo.jpg altenter image description herep  pBut as soon as one of the buttons gets a bit longer title, it breaks like this img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comMEy99.jpg altenter image description herep  pWhat I ended up doing is calculating width of each button and then if button1 width is greater than half of the view and greater than button2 width, Ive usedp  precodeH10[questionButton1btn1width]5[questionButton2gtbtn2width]10 codepre  pIt kind of works but I dont really like the look of my code with this kind of calculations.  Just imagine complexity it adds with the third button. Also, there is a problem if both buttons have pretty long title in which case I would have to figure out if I should reduce the font size to make everything fit.p  pIm posting this here because I might be missing some magical thing regarding autolayout since I only started using it in code today. Any kind of help would be greatly appreciated.p  p UPDATE clarification p  pI want the buttons to split evenly considering the margins 10 on the outside and 5 between buttons. Ideally they should be the same width if the text size would fit their default size 5050 for two buttons and 333333 for three buttons. In case the button title exceeds that perfect width, the button should extend its width if it is allowed by other buttons if others can shrink. If there is no extension or shrinking possible, the big button should reduce font size and repeat the procedure check if other buttons can shrink. Yeah, I know, Im asking for a lot p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comzZcxq.jpg althow it looks when it worksp  p UPDATE p  pSikhapols answer helped me solve it.

Negative 99 pOur project uses the Shibboleth to do Singlesignon. We are able to put the Singlesignon using the phExternalAuthn type LoginHandler. We use our own Service Provider. Now we are putting the Authorization mechanism. Here are some a hrefhttpshibboleth.1660669.n2.nabble.comBestapproachtoreleasetheauthorizationdetailstotheServiceProviderSPtc7609839.html relnofollowdetailsa.p  pSo, after some research we came to one conclusion that, the Shibboleth IDPs dataConnector has to query for the Authorization details attributes and it has to resolve those attributes to release to the ServiceProviderSP so that, the ServiceProviderSP can do the Authorization checks based on the Authorization details.p  pNow, I would like to use the Restful dataConnector because inorder to access the dataBase we are using the RestFul protocol. All my Resful webservice APIs use the POST request to get the data. and the request and response data is of type JSON. I saw a hrefhttpstaff.washington.edufoxshibboleth relnofollowRestFul DataConnector Extensiona. But, before using that I have few questions. Please check the below questionsp  p1 Will this RestFul DataConnector extension support the Http Post request with a JSON request If so how can I send my request JSON data using the XML. All my request data are dynamic ones ie.., the request data will be varying dynamically based on the user who is trying to login.p  pIf not, Can you please guide me, in which way I can achieve my above tasks Or please provide the dataConnector extension which support POST request.p  p2 My response data is also JSON. So, Will this extension can process the JSON response. If so, can I give the xpath of my response for the Attribute element.p  pIf not, Can you please provide me valid extension which can do that.p  pPlease help me, I dont have any source to develop all this.p  pAny Suggestions would be appreciated.p

Negative 99 pI am quite new to Spring and have a question related to Spring Service naming convention.p  pI have written a service, and used an annotation to define and name it.p  pServicevalueCustomerServicep  pThis service is implemented within a library that is used by a web app. Everything works fine and I can autowire my service into my client components.p  pNow I would also like to expose this service using http invoker. This works ok. I have define a CustomerService http service which accesses CustomerService bean.p  pThe issue I have is that one of my components, a client side component, that I used in my web app CustomerDetailsValidator can also be used in this new application.p  pIn my CustomerDetailsValidator I have something like thisp  pAutowired QualifiernameCustomerService.p  pBut if I want to reuse my CustomerDetailsValidator and use it in my new app, this time I need to wire it to the httpservice instead. Which means that the Autowired and Qualifier code is useless.p  pMy question is what is the best practice in this casep  pShould I still use Service I guess I cannot use Qualifier anymore.p  pMy feeling is that I should define everything in xml in each application context.p  pThe web app using the library directly would just use the CustomerService bean as a singleton.

Negative 99 pI want to do a couple of dboperations in a single transaction.

Negative 99 pSeeking some advice before I dig in. Let me explain the ask and my current process.p  pWe currently have Dev teams who require refreshed data from the Prod databases placed into there DEV databases. There requirements change, sometimes they just need tables and other times they need different subsets of the belowp  precodeTables Views Stored Procedures Users Schemas codepre  pCurrently the process is completely manual and is as outlined belowp  ol liDisable Job responsible for replication of Prod DB actually standbyli liHighlight Prod DB and Generate Scripts li liSelect the Options that is required see above e.g. tables views etc..li liBackup Dev DB just in caseli lispmsforeachtable and drop each table from dev dbli liExecute the script that was generated from step 2 on dev dbli liThen use the import wizard to pull the data from the prod sourceli liAn additional sql script is often required to run post import on new Dev DB scrubberli liEnable Job on prod for replli ol  pThe SQL Server instance hosts can change as can the databases so variables will need to be passed. The SQL Servers are 2008 on Windows 2008. The box that I host the scriptinstance on can be any version of windows and any version of SQL Server.p  pIm hoping to automate this process, at first just for the SA teams so could be ps or cli. Eventually hopefully sooner than later however present this in some type of ui to the dev teams so they can manage themselves.p  pId prefer if this all runs from a management box running SQL Server and not the SQL Server instances that host the databases. Im not sure what options are available but I suspect SSIS could be used or PowerShell and SMO and Im sure there are other crude ways.p  pId like this to be somewhat elegant so its easily presentable to management. Im comfortable with PowerShell and SQL but have no experience with SSIS.p  pAnyway looking for some suggestions.p  pEDITp  pSo my Requirements have actually changed. I now need to scrub the data then backup then post to a share for dev. Im nearing completion of my script, which is powershell using SMO. Ill give a brief description below and when Im complete Ill post more details. Prod is over wan, as are the backups. We have have log shipping enabled to my site which is the data I have to work with. Steps are probably going to make some gringe but its necessary because by db is standby. p  ol liCreate new database by looping through source DB using smo for filesfile settingsli liBackup the newly create database with standby  readonlyli liStop Job for log shipping to source dbli liTake source db offlineli liTake newly create db offlineli liReplace newly created DB files with source db filesli liBring both DBs back on lineli liStart Job for log shipping to source dbli liRestore new created  newly copied file DB with recoveryli liExecute .sql to scrub new DB li liBackup new DBli liCopy to share for devli ol  pSo thats it, all sql related work is done through SMO.

When I run the exact same class method, but called codeaftercreatecode in a model, 3 of the variables are empty, and one of them holds the value of a different variable.

Negative 99 pbr I just recently started with iOS development. The only thing is that I am trying to develop apps Models, Views, Controllers 100 programmatically, which means that I do not use Storyboards or xib files. I do it because I need to get an understanding how app works internally where it starts, how it goes from one view controller to another, how everything is connected, where from all the files are loaded. Of course, later Ill start all the features XCode suggests.br However, I think there is a problem that I am constantly hitting and for which I could not find an answer since there are not that many sample codes published for apps created programmatically. Usually, an example explains how to use, lets say a UINavigationBar or UITableView, but puts all of them into emAppDelegate.mem file, what I do not really like since it kills all the idea of MVC. So, here is my questionbr I figured out that app starts execution at emmain.mem file and then goes to emAppDelegate.mem. So, I put my window and rootViewController initialization there. But, emwhich view controller should I put really as a root view controllerem I am not creating anything fancy, and usually I am satisfied with default implementations, so it does not really make sense to inherit from base class. So, what should I do in this case Where should I put all my configurations and settings Should I really put it in my emAppDelegateem filebr Here is an example. I am trying to create Checklist app brbmain.mbbrp  precodeimport ltUIKitUIKit.hgt import AppDelegate.h  int mainint argc, char  argv[]      autoreleasepool          return UIApplicationMainargc, argv, nil,     NSStringFromClass[AppDelegate class]       codepre  pbr strongAppDelegate.h has default interface, so AppDelegate.mstrong brbrp  precodeimport AppDelegate.h import MainTableViewController.h     implementation AppDelegate    BOOLapplicationUIApplication application didFinishLaunchingWithOptionsNSDictionary launchOptions   [self setWindow[[UIWindow alloc] initWithFrame[[UIScreen mainScreen] bounds]]]  MainTableViewController tablevc  [[MainTableViewController alloc] initWithStyleUITableViewStylePlain] [[self window] setRootViewControllertablevc] return YES  end codepre  pstrongMainTableViewController.hstrongp  precodeimport ltUIKitUIKit.hgt interface MainTableViewController  UITableViewController end codepre  pstrongMainTableViewController.mstrongp  precodeimport MainTableViewController.h implementation MainTableViewController   voidviewDidLoad      [super viewDidLoad]      put my code here   pragma mark  Table view data source   NSIntegernumberOfSectionsInTableViewUITableView tableView  warning Potentially incomplete method implementation.

Make then goes on to try and load the files according to later rules in the Makefile.p  pDue to the number of files in the project Id rather not write a list of them manually but if it comes to that I might have to.p

Negative 99 pFirst time working on a Firebase app. I understand that it doest not allow you to save actual Objective C object.I understand that everything is saved in a JSON tree which can be NSStrings, NSNumbers, NSArrays, NSDictionaries.

Negative 99 pI am doing some groundwork on building my first python flask web application. I have sorted out most of the details I need on the server side, but I have few questions on how to implement things on client side.p  pMy Application is going to be a single page application with data populated dynamically depending on user action.p  pSay, I have a template called index.html which has a menu selection on left hand side and a table structure on the right hand side of the template. When an user selects an option from menu, I will post an AJAX request from the client to server and the flask app routes returns a JSON response.p  pThis is where my issue is. I know how to fill in a table data when rendering a page.I can use p  precoderendertemplateindex.html,tabledata  tabledata  codepre  pin my server side to send table data and use p  precode for data in tabledata  lttrgt data lttrgt  endfor  codepre  pin my client side, I can use a code as above. p  pBut since I am planning to use AJAX requests, I am not sure how to populate the table data returned from AJAX request in already rendered flask template. p  pI searched for answer and I have found out that I have to build the table dynamically using Javascript. But I want to know is there any better way to fill in the template I am trying to avoid building html table using javascript.p  pThanksp

Negative 99 pIm trying to make a program that simulates kind of pacman like version. We simulate a ghost chasing pacman. Both have to be on the points of a p  p grid of natural numbers, that is, all sets of numbers x, y, where x, y  0, 1, . . . ,n  1, n  1. Both the ghoost and pacman are put at some particular beginning positions. The ghost can see the pacman and p  pmoves towards it until it gets the it, which happens when both are at the same position. At that point the project ends. The amusement continues in rounds, where a round comprises of the pacman moving and after that the ghost moves. p  pThe mouse moves randomly,  right, left, one position up, down or stays at the position. p  pThe chances for each of the five occasions to happen are equivalent. The ghost can move one or two positions up, down, left, or right.  It can likewise move slantingly in each of the four headings to the following position, for instance structure [3 8] to [2 9]. The ghost never stays at the same spot. p  pNobody can leave the matrix. The pacman will never move to the position of the ghost. p  pId like to utilize Math.random and compose a class Pacmanandghost with a method.p  pHere the parameter n indicates the size of the grid, the other four parameters determine the beginning positions of the ghost and pacman in the a standard output format. p  pIts a school project, anyone who can give me a helping hand on what to begin withp
