Positive 1383 pstrongSummarystrong I need a PNG writer and for various reasons I had to make it from scratch. I dont need to compress the image data, so I implemented PNG using the nocompression deflate algorithm. Rendering fails for images requiring multiple deflate blocks, seemingly because it ignores block lengths.p  pstrongIssuestrong When I have a tiny image written with a single deflate block, the resulting image is exactly what it is supposed to be all pixels correct, no errors when checked with a hrefhttpgnuwin32.sourceforge.netpackagespngutils.htm relnofollowpngchecka. However, as soon as I use multiple deflate blocks the resulting image is wrong because deflate blocks are being read past their lengths though pngcheck still shows no errors. Looking at the raw data in a hex editor seems to show that everything is to spec according to a hrefhttpwww.libpng.orgpubpngspec1.2png1.2pdg.html relnofollowlibpnga, RFC 1950, and RFC 1951.p  pstrongExample Datastrong I generated a 3x1 RGBA image where the pixel colors are, from left to right, codefb,02,03,facode, code01,fc,03,facode, code01,02,fd,facode. I then wrote them to file with either an 8byte or 64byte maximum deflate block length.

In the 8byte block image, the length for the first block is 8 just as it should be. The 8 bytes after the length complement in italics above are indeed the values they are supposed to be, and the 9th byte equals 1 and starts the final block. However, that 1 is being interpreted as a color value the alpha for the second pixel instead of as the start of the next blockp  pPresumably there is something that Im missing about the structure of deflate blocks.

Positive 1383 pI have a set of engineering drawings and certain diagrams  are rotated by either 90,180 or 270 degree. To get the correct image I need to find the angle by which it is rotated and rotate it by that angle. I need to automate this process using python.     So far I have come across a few methodologies like finding the exif datait doesnt work in this case because these images initially were pdfs that were converted to tifpng files. I also have a few tilted diagrams within the normal engineeringi.e. doesnt need rotation, thereby baring me from using the slope of a line to find the angle of rotation. From what I understand the rotation of the texts within the image can be used to find the angle to be rotated. But I am at a dead end on how to do that. Could anybody help me pleasep

Positive 1383 pIm trying to modify the LSB in Pixels in order to Store Information in a Picture. The Encoding and Decoding does work how ever when i store the Bitmap to a png file which should be lossless and reload it the Pixel values have changed. This ofcourse leads to wrong values when i put the character back to gether however most of the times this can be fixed by substracting 136 from the Byte before making a char out of it. The Problem has to be the storing and reloading as when i pass the Bitmap directly to the Decoder everything works fine. p

Negative 1383 pLots of sites appear to support https but dont use secure cookies.  I want to make my site use secure cookies but to allow for some content to be accessed using http instead.p  pA sensible way to do this appears to be to have a secure cookie for the real session, and a nonsecure cookie which is just a flag to say if the user is logged in or not to display different things in the header, like a logout link instead of a login link.  This cookie wouldnt contain any real session information and is just so that the site can show pages slightly differently for loggedin users compared to loggedout ones on http portions of the site.p  pHaving the whole site as https is another option but this appears to be quite a bit slower than plain http and so is not really ideal.p  pWhy dont sites use this kind of setup and have secure cookies  The possibility of cookie theft seems to make secure cookies a necessity nowadays.

For those of you unfamiliar with activepassive sql clustering, you cannot connect directly to one of the nodes.  Instead the sql cluster gets a virtual name and another ip address that clients would then connect to.  The current code I have will try to connect to NodeNameinstanceName which obviously will not work on the cluster.  Instead I need to programmatically find the SQL cluster virtual name that this node belongs to and connect to that instead.  I thought I might be able to get this information from the MSClusterCluster WMI class, but that will only get me the cluster virtual name, not the SQL cluster virtual name.  Thanks in advance.p

Negative 1383 pId like to create an codeIListltChildgtcode that maintains its codeChildcode objects in a defaultimplicit sort order at all times i.e. regardless of additionsremovals to the underlying list.  p  pWhat Im specifically trying to avoid is the need for all consumers of said codeIListltChildgtcode to explicitly invoke codeIEnumerableltTgt.OrderBycode every time they want to enumerate it.  Apart from violating DRY, such an approach would also break encapsulation as consumers would have to know that my list is even sorted, which is really none of their business  p  pThe solution that seemed most logicalefficient was to expose codeIListltChildgtcode as codeIEnumerableltChildgtcode to prevent List mutations and add explicit AddRemove methods to the containing codeParentcode. This way, I can intercept changes to the List that necessitate a resort, and apply one via Linqp  precodepublic class Child    public string StringProperty   public int IntProperty   public class Parent private IListltChildgt children  new ListltChildgt        public IEnumerableltChildgt Children       get                        return children                        private void ReSortChildren         children  new ListltChildgtchild.OrderBycgtc.StringProperty              public void AddChildChild c           children.Add           ReSortChildren              public void RemoveChildChild c           children.Removec           ReSortChildren         codepre  pStill, this approach doesnt intercept changes made to the underlying codeChild.StringPropertycode which in this case is the property driving the  sort.

Its not a good idea to store generated code in sourcecontrol lets not debate the merits of that here. 2.

Negative 1383 blockquote   pstrongPossible Duplicatestrongbr   a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2138658databasedesignquestiondatabase design questiona  p blockquote    pFor performance and future data editing, is it better to store all lookup values in 1 table or each to its own table I have items like Industry, Sub industry, Sector, Sector type, etc Each of these have between 5 to 50 values. Each can be related like Sector belongs to Sector type. Industry belongs to industry type. Sub industry belongs to industry. Company belongs to subindustry, etc. Some lookup data is system provided some are user provided User provided data is huge in excess of millions as those are like product names, brand names etc. If I create separate look up table for each there are tons of these. If I group all into 1 then I lose out on making relationships between them in the database. Any suggestionsp
Negative 1383 pI want to port a simple game someone else has written in Java to GWT. He organized it mainly into two packages One for the user interface and one for the game logic. Hopefully, I can reuse his game logic and just rewrite the user interface, but I might need to change some things in order to make it compile with GWT.p  pIm wondering on how to best reuse his game logic code. Its open source, so I have a range of possibilities. Should I use gits subtree merge or submodules features to somehow fumble his code into my repository Or should I just emgulpem copy and paste the game logic code If I do the latter, it would be extremely difficult to contribute back to the main project or inherit improvements and bug fixes from it.p  pI asked him whether he would like to split his game into two projects One for the UI and one for the game logic, but this would lead to problems as soon as I have to change the game logic code to make it compile in GWT. Furthermore, he didnt like the idea of splitting a single application into several projects, he wants to keep it simple and I respect that.p  pHow can I best approach this port I presume it has happened before, i.e. when porting piece of Java software to JavaME or vice versa.p

Negative 1383 pIm currently looking into Clojure and Incanter as an alternative to R. Not that I dislike R, but it just interesting to try out new languages.

This succeeds even if only some or none for that matter of the SPNs I pass in are found on that account.p  pIve read the MSDN documentation and it doesnt mention succeeding or failing based on the existance of the SPNs passed to the function. Im just wondering if this is luck or is the function guaranteed to succeed even if it didnt delete any SPNsp  pTIAp

Negative 1383 pI have a situation where I am querying a RESTful webservice using .NET that returns data as XML. I have written wrapper functions around the API so that instead of returning raw XML I return full .NET objects that mirror the structure of the XML. The XML can be quite complicated so these objects can be pretty large and heavily nested ie. contain collections that in turn may house other collections etc..p  pThe REST API has an option to return a full result or a basic result. The basic result returns a small subset of the data that the full result does. Currently I am dealing with the two types of response by returning the same .NET object for both types of request  but in the basic request some of the properties are not populated. This is best shown by a very oversimplified example of the codep  precodepublic class PersonResponse      public string Name  get set      public string Age  get set      public IListltHistoryDetailsgt LifeHistory  get set    public class PersonRequest      public PersonResponse GetBasicResponse              return new PersonResponse                        Name  John Doe,              Age  50,              LifeHistory  null                     public PersonResponse GetFullResponse              return new PersonResponse                        Name  John Doe,              Age  50,              LifeHistory  PopulateHistoryUsingExpensiveXmlParsing                codepre  pAs you can see the codePersonRequestcode class has two methods that both return a codePersonResponsecode object. However the codeGetBasicResponsecode method is a lite version  it doesnt populate all the properties in the example it doesnt populate the codeLifeHistorycode collection as this is an expensive operation. Note this is a emveryem simplified version of what actually happens.p  pHowever, to me this has a definite smell to it since the caller of the codeGetBasicResponsecode method needs to understand which properties will not be populated. p  pI was thinking a more OOP methodology would be to have two codePersonResponsecode objects  a codeBasicPersonResponsecode object and a codeFullPersonResponsecode with the latter inheriting from the former. Something likep  precodepublic class BasicPersonResponse      public string Name  get set      public string Age  get set    public class FullPersonResponse  BasicPersonResponse      public IListltobjectgt LifeHistory  get set    public class PersonRequest      public BasicPersonResponse GetBasicResponse              return new FullPersonResponse                       ...                    public FullPersonResponse GetFullResponse              return new FullPersonResponse                       ...                codepre  pHowever, this still doesnt quite feel right  for reasons Im not entirely sure ofp  pIs there a better design pattern to deal with this situation I feel like Im missing something more elegant Thanksp

Negative 1383 pI am new to xcode and trying to understand how UITabBarController works. I have been looking everywhere and could not find a straight solution to this question. In the majority of the examplestutorials that I see, the UITabBarController is defined in the AppDelegate, and then once you launch the app, you see the tab bar right away. In my app, I want to show a welcome screen first, then once you click Enter you get to the tabbar view. So the ideal structure of my objects will be the followingp  pMyProjectAppDelegate  MyProjectViewController  FirstView  SecondViewp  pAs far as my understanding, nothing tabbar related should then be declared in MyProjectAppDelegate with this structure. I tried to look at some examples where the UITabBarController is declared in the AppDelegate and do the same in the MyProjectViewController, but nothing happens. p  pFor example, I did this in my MyProjectViewController within an IBAction that is connected to the Enter UiButton on my welcome screenp  precode IBAction EnterApp   [window addSubviewtabBarController.view]  tabBarController  [[UITabBarController alloc] init] tabBarController.delegateself  FirstView first  [[FirstView alloc] init]   UINavigationController firstNav  [[UINavigationController alloc] initWithRootViewControllerfirst]    SecondView second  [[SecondView alloc] init]   UINavigationController secondNav  [[UINavigationController alloc] initWithRootViewControllersecond]    NSArray controllers  [NSArray  arrayWithObjectsfirstNav,secondNav, nil]   tabBarController.viewControllers  controllers    [window addSubviewtabBarController.view]      codepre  pAgain, this did not do anything once I clicked on the Enter button, even though it does the job in the example where I took it from where its within the AppDelegate p  pI also tried this on my MyProjectViewController, where the tabbar did show up on the FirstSecond view, but with no option to customize it just blank black bars with nothing on them and no idea where to configure themp  precode IBAction EnterApp   self.window  [[UIWindow alloc] initWithFrame[[UIScreen mainScreen] bounds]] UIViewController viewController1  [[FirstView alloc] initWithNibNameFirstView bundlenil] UIViewController viewController2  [[SecondView alloc] initWithNibNameSecondView bundlenil] self.tabBarController  [[UITabBarController alloc] init] self.tabBarController.viewControllers  [NSArray arrayWithObjectsviewController1, viewController2, nil]   self.window.rootViewController  self.tabBarController [self.window makeKeyAndVisible]   codepre  pWhat went wrong here and what should be the right way to go about doing that A quick example would be highly appreciated. p  pThanks p

Negative 1383 pFirst I have 3 TextBoxes, a DropDownList, a CheckBox, and 2 LinkButtons in a table. The TextBoxes and DropDownList must do an AutoPostBack because there are some calculations being done on the server side which called by OnTextChanged. p  pMy issue here is that after the content of any Control which requires a PostBack changes and you attempt to move focus to any other Control on the page whether it be tabbing or using the mouse to click on any other Control the focus does not move to the next Control or the Control you clicked.  p  pI tried using a method which finds the current Control and based on the TabIndex, adds 1 which moves the focus to the next control. The problem here is that it does not allow for focus to be set on any other Control other than that one with the next TabIndex. To better explain here is an example of the situation.p  pExample I have TextBox1, TextBox2, and TextBox3. I change the content in TextBox2 then want to move backwards to TextBox1. When I click in TextBox1 the focus is set to TextBox3 since the code is using the order of the TabIndex.  A key factor here is that TextBox1 DOES get focus before the server side code fires but then loses focus and sets it on TextBox3 p  pTo me, it seems like the only way this can be accomplished would be to add a function on the client side which finds the Control with focus before the PostBack occurs, then reset the focus on that Control after the server side code completes. It does not seem like anything I do on the server side will work since the focus has already been lost when this occurs.p  pI have searched and searched but have not been able to find any solution to this particular issue, everything I have found deals with setting focus to the NEXT Control instead of the Control you want to have focus. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance.p  pHere is the code I am using to move to the next Control based on the TabIndex but this does not work in my situation.p  precodeprotected void PageLoadobject sender, EventArgs e              WebControl ctrl  GetPostBackControl as WebControl         if ctrl  null ampamp SetNextFocusControls, ctrl.TabIndex  1  ctrl.Focus        public Control GetPostBackControl              Control control  null          string ctrlname  Request.Params.GetEVENTTARGET         if ctrlname  null ampamp ctrlname  string.Empty                      control  FindControlctrlname             control.Focus                  else                      foreach string ctl in Request.Form                              Control c  FindControlctl                 if c is Button                                      control  c                     break                                                return control           private bool SetNextFocusControlCollection controls, int tabIndex              foreach Control control in controls                      if control.HasControls                              bool found  SetNextFocuscontrol.Controls, tabIndex                 if found  return true                            WebControl webControl  control as WebControl             if webControl  null  continue              if webControl.TabIndex  tabIndex  continue               webControl.Focus             return true                   return false      codepre

Negative 1383 h2First up, where my knowledge is ath2  pemUnit Testsem are those which test a small piece of code single methods, mostly. p  pemIntegration Testsem are those which test the interaction between multiple areas of code which hopefully already have their own Unit Tests. Sometimes, parts of the code under test requires other code to act in a particular way. This is where Mocks amp Stubs come in. So, we mockstub out a part of the code to perform very specifically. This allows our Integration Test to run predictably without side effects.p  pAll tests should be able to be run standalone without data sharing. If data sharing is necessary, this is a sign the system isnt decoupled enough.p  h2Next up, the situation I am facingh2  pWhen interacting with an external API specifically, a RESTful API that will modify live data with a POST request, I understand we can should mock out the interaction with that API more eloquently stated in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions559092howcanmockingexternalservicesimproveunittests559177559177this answera for an Integration Test. I also understand we can Unit Test the individual components of interacting with that API constructing the request, parsing the result, throwing errors, etc. What I dont get is how to actually go about this.p  h2So, finally My questions.h2  pHow do I test my interaction with an external API that has side effectsp  pA perfect example is a hrefhttpcode.google.comapisshoppingcontentgettingstartedusingapiproducts.htmlGoogles Content API for shoppinga. To be able to perform the task at hand, it requires a decent amount of prep work, then performing the actual request, then analysing the return value. Some of this is a hrefhttpsgroups.google.comgroupgooglecontentapiforshoppingbrowsethreadthreadad6d1f482a7cae4dmsgd4ab56ab47877fbawithout any sandbox environmenta.p  pThe code to do this generally has quite a few layers of abstraction, something likep  pre classlangphp prettyprintoverridecodeltphp class Request      public function setUrl..  ...       public function setData..  ...       public function setHeaders..  ...       public function execute..

And even if I did, it would mean setting up results  entry points for every possible code path that Googles API accepts which in this case would have to be found by trial and error, but would allow me the use of fixtures.p  pA further extension is when certain requests rely on certain data being Live already. Using the Google Content API as an example again, to add a Data Feed to a Sub Account, the Sub Account must already exist.p  pOne approach I can think of is the following stepsp  ol liIn codetestCreateAccountcode ol liCreate a subaccountli liAssert the subaccount was createdli liDelete the subaccountli olli liHave codetestCreateDataFeedcode depend on codetestCreateAccountcode not having any errors ol liIn codetestCreateDataFeedcode, create a new accountli liCreate the data feedli liAssert the data feed was createdli liDelete the data feedli liDelete the subaccountli olli ol  pThis then raises the further question how do I test the deletion of accounts  data feeds codetestCreateDataFeedcode feels dirty to me  What if creating the data feed fails The test fails, therefore the subaccount is never deleted... I cant test deletion without creation, so do I write another test codetestDeleteAccountcode that relies on codetestCreateAccountcode before creating then deleting an account of its own since data shouldnt be shared between tests.p  h2In Summaryh2  ul liHow do I test interacting with an external API that effects live datali liHow can I mock  stub objects in an Integration test when theyre hidden behind layers of abstractionli liWhat do I do when a test fails and the live data is left in an inconsistent stateli liHow emin codeem do I actually go about doing all thisli ul  hr  pRelatedp  ul lia hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions559092howcanmockingexternalservicesimproveunittests559177How can mocking external services improve unit testsali lia hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7380903writingunittestsforarestfulapiWriting unit tests for a RESTful APIali ul

It works fine until the screen is rotated, after that nothing happens on click.p  pTo deal with this issue I want to catch onConfigurationChanged, but it never gets called I never get to see the log message from  onConfigurationChanged, I do however see another message in the log IActivityManager   63 Config changed  indicating that the configuration gets changed and that it would be reasonable to expect a call to onConfigurationChanged.p  pPlease help p  h2Manifesth2  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingutf8gt   ltmanifest xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid       packageaa.android.x10.mini.mywidget androidversionCode1       androidversionName1.0gt   ltapplication androidicondrawableicon               androidlabelstringappnamegt        ltreceiver androidnameMyWidgetProvider androidlabelMy Widgetgt           ltintentfiltergt               ltaction androidnameandroid.appwidget.action.APPWIDGETUPDATE gt               ltaction androidnameandroid.appwidget.action.ACTIONBATTERYCHANGED gt          ltintentfiltergt           ltmetadata androidnameandroid.appwidget.provider                      androidresourcexmlwidgetinfo gt       ltreceivergt       ltservice androidname.UpdateWidgetService              androidconfigChangeskeyboardHiddenorientationgtltservicegt       ltactivity androidname.Testgtltactivitygt        ltapplicationgt       ltusessdk androidminSdkVersion7 gt    ltmanifestgt    codepre  hr  pWidgetProvider     package aa.android.x10.mini.mywidgetp  precodeimport android.app.PendingIntent   import android.appwidget.AppWidgetManager   import android.appwidget.AppWidgetProvider   import android.content.Context   import android.content.Intent   import android.util.Log import android.widget.RemoteViews    public class MyWidgetProvider extends AppWidgetProvider      Override   public void onUpdateContext context, AppWidgetManager appWidgetManager,           int[] appWidgetIds         Log.iMyWidgetProvider onUpdate,  CALLED        RemoteViews remoteViews  new RemoteViewscontext.getPackageName,               R.layout.widgetlayout       Intent intent  new Intentcontext.getApplicationContext, UpdateWidgetService.class       intent.putExtraAppWidgetManager.EXTRAAPPWIDGETIDS, appWidgetIds        PendingIntent pendingIntent  PendingIntent.getServicecontext.getApplicationContext, 0, intent,                                                              PendingIntent.FLAGUPDATECURRENT      remoteViews.setOnClickPendingIntentR.id.TextView01, pendingIntent        appWidgetManager.updateAppWidgetappWidgetIds, remoteViews        context.startServiceintent             codepre  hr  pService     package aa.android.x10.mini.mywidgetp  precodeimport android.app.Service import android.appwidget.AppWidgetManager import android.content.Intent import android.content.res.Configuration import android.media.AudioManager import android.os.IBinder import android.util.Log import android.widget.RemoteViews  public class UpdateWidgetService extends Service     Override   public void onStartIntent intent, int startId         Log.iUpdateWidgetService,  CALLED        String state  null        AudioManager mAudioManager  AudioManager getSystemServiceAUDIOSERVICE      if mAudioManager.getRingerMode  AudioManager.RINGERMODENORMAL               mAudioManager.setRingerModeAudioManager.RINGERMODENORMAL         mAudioManager.setStreamVolumeAudioManager.STREAMRING,mAudioManager.getStreamMaxVolumeAudioManager.STREAMRING,AudioManager.VIBRATESETTINGON         state  ON           else              mAudioManager.setRingerModeAudioManager.RINGERMODEVIBRATE         mAudioManager.setStreamVolumeAudioManager.STREAMRING,0,AudioManager.VIBRATESETTINGON         state  OFF            AppWidgetManager appWidgetManager  AppWidgetManager.getInstancethis.getApplicationContext        int[] appWidgetIds  intent.getIntArrayExtraAppWidgetManager.EXTRAAPPWIDGETIDS       if appWidgetIds.length gt 0                 for int widgetId  appWidgetIds                         RemoteViews remoteViews  new RemoteViewsgetPackageName, R.layout.widgetlayout               remoteViews.setTextViewTextR.id.TextView01, n           state                   appWidgetManager.updateAppWidgetwidgetId, remoteViews                              stopSelf                      super.onStartintent, startId               Override       public IBinder onBindIntent intent                 return null               Override      public void onConfigurationChangedConfiguration newConfig                Log.ionConfigurationChanged,  CALLED            super.onConfigurationChangednewConfig         codepre  hr  pLog when rotating the screenp  precodeIWindowManager   63 Setting rotation to 1, animFlags0  IActivityManager   63 Config changed  scale1.0 imsi310260 locenUS touch3 keys211 nav31 orien2 layout17  IUsageStats   63 Unexpected resume of com.android.launcher while already resumed in com.android.launcher  codepre

Negative 1383 pI am carefully assessing the best way to utilize a hrefhttpwww.modernizr.comModernizra and a hrefhttpsgithub.comscottjehlRespondreadmeRespond.jsa for responsive design and have a couple of questions for the community.p  pFirstly, it is my understanding that when bundling Modernizr with Respond.js, no other coding or tests are required for media query support in IE8 and below. In other words, when Respond.js is bundled with Modernizr I merely have to load Modernizr in my source to get Respond.js active. Correctp  pSecondly, do you believe this is the most efficient way to achieve support for media queries in IE8 and below In essence, I would be including a larger Modernizr script than is needed for browsers that already support media queries. Wouldnt it be more efficient to separate the two scripts and only load Respond.js if a test for media queries failsp  pThird, if I would like to separate the two scripts, what do you believe is the best way to load Respond.js if needed One option would be to use an IE specific conditional comment to load Respond. Another option is to use yepnope and Modernizr to test for media query support and load Respond if needed. Which would be more efficient and faultproof.p  pLastly, if I choose to separate the two scripts and use Modernizr to load Respond if needed I have encountered the two following techniquesp  precodeltscriptgt         yepnope     test  Modernizr.mqonly all,     nope  [jslibsrespond.min.js]  ltscriptgt codepre  pORp  precodeltscriptgtModernizr.mqminwidth0  document.writeltscript srcjslibsrespond.min.jsgtltscriptgtltscriptgt codepre  pI have found that the second crashes IE8, but must just need rewriting.

Negative 1383 pIve just build my first Helper in MVC, its very basic and just displays a string where ever I use it. So its a .cshtml file in my AppCode folder, I think that is how its supposed to be set up, with the following code in it,p  precodehelper DisplaySelect      This text is coming from an helper class.  codepre  pNow I am a wiz with helpers how do I make it do things. E.g.. say I want it to query the database and display something, I would normally do that work in my controller. How do I do that with helpers, do I create a helper controller and then treat the helper like a partial viewp  pAny help would be greatly appreciated.p  pCheers,p  pMike.p  hr  pThanks guys,p  pIve asked that question before Shark Why would you use a helper and not a partial view the answer I got there was a partial view is more for just displaying common HTML where as a Helper can have a bunch of code in it and do all kinds of great processing stuff. Now it seems thats not true and they are pretty much the same thing, in some respect, except in Link664s casep  pI like what youre saying Link664 that makes sense as it cleans up the code nicely.p  pWhat I was going to do was try and populate a drop down list in a helper and then use it in multiple places, but from my research today thats not what helpers are for.

Negative 1383 pI have a BlackBerry javabased app that works with salesforce data and uses oauth 2 for authentication. It has been working fine until recently when users have been complaining that once they get to the acceptdeny salesforce oauth page, clicking on Accept button displays a salesforce 404 page.p  pI attached a debugger to the bb simulator OS7 and found that everything was working fine up to the point where a POST is made to salesforce on pressing the ACCEPT button in the final stage of authenticationauthorisation via salesforce oauth2 user agent flow. At this point, the post would succeed and the response body would contain some markup with a small JavaScript block that just performs a document.location.href assignment to force the browser to navigate to a new URL. I noticed that the URL was not what I was expecting  I was expecting to see the redirecturi callback address  the access token etc data appended to the end of it as per the sf oauth2 documentation. What I saw instead was a URL that when navigated to leads the user back to a login page with a message saying that they are attempting to access a resource that requires authentication.p  pIf I perform the same flow in say chrome the URL after the post is what I expect. This all used to work just fine so I am confused as to why it would stop working all of a sudden. Ive heard that Salesforce changed their oauth 2 implementation back in late 2011 slightly so I wonder if this has broken my client although I dont see how.p  pAs an experiment I removed all of my code except for an embedded BrowserField and made it navigate to the oauth URL as constructed by combining consumer key and various other values as per the documentation and it still fails with a 404 page at the point of clicking on the accept button after a successful login.p  pIf I try the same bootstrap oauth URL in the built in bb browser the full authentication flow works fine and I am eventually redirected to the final callback URL with access token information appended.p  pHas anyone else out there had trouble with oauth2 user agent flow on BrowserField from field2 packagep

Negative 1383 pWeve recently had the traditional and ongoing according to SO searches argument about assigned GUIDs vs autoincrement primary keys. We are using MSSQL 2008R2, NHibernate 2.05 and .NET 4.0.p  pI did a fair amount of googling and reading other posts on SO about the relative insert performance difference between using the two different key types. Most of the blog posts seemed to be for fairly old versions of MSSQL server, so I thought I would try benchmarking some inserts and see if they matched what people were saying.p  pI wrote a simple app that just inserts 2 million objects one row per Session into the database and the only difference between the two runs of the app is the key type. Both keys are clustered  so from my reading this presents a good case for auto increments and the worst case for Guids.p  pWhen looking at the results I was a little shocked....p  pNot wanting to have the reign of terror of a hrefhttpzedshaw.comessaysprogrammerstats.html relnofollowZed Shawa coming down on me for not perfoming a proper statistical analysis, I loaded the data into R and generated a plot see below and got the following summary statisticsp  pstrongGUID Keysstrongp  pMin 0.00p  p1st Quartile 0.00p  pMedian 0.00p  pMean 1.975p  pStandard Deviation 13.577490p  p3rd Quartile 1.0p  pMax 3824.0p  pstrongNative autoincrement integer Keysstrongp  pMin 0.00p  p1st Quartile 0.00p  pMedian 0.00p  pMean 1.644p  pStandard Deviation 12.491320p  p3rd Quartile 0.00p  pMax 1932.00p  pAssuming that there should be a linear relationship between the size of the table and the time it takes to insert a row I tried calculating the leastsquares regression, using the table size as a predictor and got the following resultsp  pstrongGUIDstrong  0.002594p  pstrongNativestrong 0.002594p  pThe rsquared values are of the most concern to me, from my admittedly limited understanding of statistics there is no correlation between the size of the table and the insert speed for either case.p  pMy concern is that the results I am getting does not correspond to the generally accepted wisdom, and I am wondering if anybody out there in SOland can help me explain the results.

Negative 1383 pIm working on a Flash based networked game. I have to choose between ActionScript sockets and WebSockets or more specifically socket.io. Im wondering which is the better choice. Im leaning toward ActionScript sockets since it should will be standard across all browsers. With socket.io, WebSockets can only be used in HTML5 and it can even result to polling for some older browsers which is a big issue.p  pWould you guys say that ActionScript sockets is the better choice p  pThank you very muchp
Negative 1383 pI got failed to create JVM error when I tried to run a jnlp file. p  pBut it works when I removed the codemaxheapsize1100mcode from Javaj2se tag in jnlp.p  pIt seems something wrong with the codemaxheapsizecode. I did some experiments to change the heap size in codeeclipse.inicode file. The biggest heap size I could set is 940M, otherwise I got Could not create JVM... error when start the eclipse. p  pI suspect this is a memoryhardware problem on my PC. My laptop is pretty new. But for some reason, my admin change the OS from Windows 7 to Windows XP. They now want to change back to windows 7. p  pI am using JDK 1.6 update 29 and eclipse Version 3.7.0 Build id I201106131736.

Negative 1383 pI am asked to find a solution for the finance team. They have a manual workflow to prepare some reports based on some finance information which is stored in database two different  DB. The process of preparing these reports required some approval from different people in the group, so there is a specific workflow and move back and forth. I am curious to know if we can use SharePoint Workflow and SSRS to prepare these reports. My suggested senario is By creating an XML from two difefrent databases we could have all required data in a dataset we can connect to this XML by SSRS and have access to different reports based on this XML. We can calculate and create new reports and circulate this report between certain people and get their approval and then send out the approved report as PDFExcelPrint out. So practically based on the information stored in XML a workflow is initiating and by back and forth among diffferent people an approved report will be send out.p  pDo you think it is feasible I have never used SharePoint Workflow so I am not sure if this could be a feasible solution Could you introduce me some references that I can update myselfp  pIf this is not the solution should I come up with inhouse software development from scratchp  pIts my first month working in this company and I have to have a good impression with a good solution.p  pThank you so much,p

The code in here should be stable and usable in all modern browsers.  The minified versions, while having a larger file size than the packed versions note packed version is not available in current release, are generally the best versions to use on production deployments. The packed versions require nontrivial clientside processing time to uncompress unpack the code whereas the minified versions do not. The packed versions of jQuery will take less time to download than the minified or uncompressed versions however, each time the library is loaded initially or from the browser cache it will need to be uncompressed which will cause a nontrivial delay in the execution of any jQuery code each time it is loaded.   ltdivgt   ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre

Negative 1383 pIm new to Drupal 7 coming from Drupal 6.  In 6 I used to build custom modules and use standard dbquerys to query CCK fields.  In doing so I was able to use things like JOINs and codeLOWERREPLACEn.title,  ,   scode.  p  pIm wondering if there is a way to do either using EntityFieldQuery.  The concept behind EFQ seems pretty straight forward, but in terms of field conditions, it looks like I can only check the value of a specific field using an operator.  What if I want to use the code above to check if the transformed value is equal to my valuep  pSince it loads what it needs to perform the query and fetch the NIDs and VIDs, it seems as though I wont need to use JOINs because its considering everything it needs for the specified content type.  Is usingp  precodequerygtentityConditionbundle, arrayarticle, page codepre  pandp  precodequerygtpropertyConditiontype, arrayarticle, page, blog codepre  peffectively the same a JOIN statement  Do both statements use the NIDs to join the various content typesp  pThanks, Howiep
Negative 1383 pIm having some issues finding examples of how to use the Awesomium web browser control in vb.net with objectforscripting. I know that objectforscripting isnt the same for the webcontrol used with awesomium since its HTML5 and not the traditional IE control that comes with vs 2010.p  pThe issue Im having is finding any infoexamples on how to communicate with the awesomium web browser control with my javascript. Its quite easy with the IE built in control with objectforscripting. Ive found samples of how to do it in C but I dont see any info of how I could do it just in VB.

Negative 1383 pWe run our intranet site with PHP on an iSeries with Apache.

This asp.net page will pass back a value the username.p  pI know the syntax for retrieving the username from .net.  But, what I dont want to do, is a URL redirect back to login.php with a querystring example of usernamebob ... because it is directly visible to the users and has many obvious flaws.p  pHow can I go about achieving this Maybe using Ajax Or some sort of .net code emfor exampleem  Request.LastUrlVisited.ReturnValuebob, which doesnt show in the URL barp  pI believe the asp.net page needs to specifically be a webpage, as a asp.net webservice can not retieve the username from windows.p  pThanks,p  hr  pUpdatep  pThrough the comments, ive come to understand that an asp.net webservice CAN in fact get the username.. it does not need to be a webpage.

Negative 1383 pI have a SpringWS web service that runs on a Jboss application server. I also have a SpringMVC application running on a separate server running Jboss 7. The SpringMVC application is used mainly for the user interface. The SpringWS application contains all the services for the business logic. p  pThe standard approach to use the components we have would be in the following orderp  precodeClient Browser HTTP Requestgt Spring MVC SOAP Requestgt SpringWS Client Browser ltHTTP Request Spring MVC ltSOAP Responselt SpringWS codepre  pThere is a requirement to change some of the requests coming from the Client Browser to go direct to the Web Services instead of via the Spring MVC application. The Spring MVC application will be used to load the initial presentation screens but the actions that involve any updateswrites will be going through the SpringWS process. p  pTo achieve this, we have a bespoke process which runs on the same machine as the client browser that traps all HTTP requests. Its purpose is to convert the request to a SOAP message and the response to a HTTP response. The path is shown belowp  pInitial Request Retrieve presentationuser interfacep  precodeClient Browser HTTP Requestgt Spring MVC codepre  pSubsequent requestsp  precodeClient Browser Http Request gt SOAP Converter Local process gt SOAP Request gt SpringWS Client Browser ltHttp Request  SOAP Converter Local process lt SOAP Request lt SpringWS codepre  pThere are two paths that happen in the above scenario. The initial request to display the pages on the screen will be a request to the SpringMVC process. Any subsequent requests that involve changing the data will be via the path shown above. p  pThe problem that i have now is that all responses from SpringWS the webservice are in XML format. This means that when the request comes from the browser, the data will have to come from the web service but the pages will need to be refreshed from the SpringMVC application. This somehow feels a bit wrong as each request will involve to calls. One to get the data and one to get the presentation data. p  pTo overcome this, i would like to implement the SpringMVC layer using a technique where i only need to make one initial request. This means that the user interface will rendered on the screen. All subsequent requests to the SpringWS service should not result in the browser to be rendered other than refreshing the data. p  pI am interested in knowing what kind of technologies i can use to achieve this. One way of doing this is by using Applets but this has been ruled out for security reasons. I have seen several websites which work exactly the way i have described above. i.e. the page never refreshes. A very good example is the Sonatype Nexus Maven repository manager user interface shown belowp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comO2bwd.png althttpwww.sonatype.combooksnexusbookreferencefigswebrepositorymanagerpublicinterface.pngp  pIt runs in a web browser and when the Nexus user interface loads on the browser, it is almost like a Swing type application. Any one know what technology Nexus use for the user interface p  pI guess my question is which Web based user interface technologies preferably open source can i use which has a swing type look and feel but is not Swing and requires minimal requests to the server to refresh the screens p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 1383 pI want to create a dictionary that stores the name of a mathematical function, the input a single number and the result.p  pThe structure should be something like codecache  procedure inputresultcodep  precodei.e.  cache  factorial 424, 103628800, 202432902008176640000,          square 24, 525, 10100          sum 36, 510, 714  def factorialn     print Running factorial     result  1     for i in range2, n  1         result  result  i     return result  def squaren     result  n  2     return result  def sumn     result  n  2     return result codepre  pI dont want the cache dictionary to be precreated in the sense that it may not know which mathematical functions it will store values for. I want to then create a function, named cachedexecution, that will first check the cache if the function has been called for the input and if so return what is stored as the value for the inputresult pair.p  pIf not then compute the operation, store it in cache and return the value. If the function exists in the cache then another keyvalue pair should be created under it. If not then create a new entry for the function name and store the keyvalue of the inputresult under it.p  pThe structure of cachedexecution is simple but what I cant figure out is how to append to a dictionary. It seems append is not a method that is allowed for a dictionary structure. I have tried various things without success.p  pAppreciate the help. p

Its doing this for around 40 different objects inside a for loop and it does this every time the UITableView is reloaded.p  pIs there any suggested way to listen for changes in Core Data NSManagedObjects or a way to cache data at my level, or should I rely on data faulting and its just that Im doing something wrongp  pIf you could point me to a good pattern to handle this situations Id be immensely thankful.p
Negative 1383 pI am looking to get Microsoft Azure to run Sharepoint on, and I intend to use a virtual machine. Right now, I am trying to figure out what size of virtual machine to get, and how many.

So this is why I am wondering how many virtual machines, and what size, it will take to run Sharepoint. Thanks.p

Negative 1383 pI have a large 6MB binary string. Now id like to replace some bytes withing a range of the string.p  pLets say, replace substring binary, bytes from offset 1024 with length 84 with another string binary, bytes with the strongsame lengthstrong no data extending.p  pHow can i do this with php so that the performance will not be very bad.p  pThanksp
Negative 1383 pI have been digging around in Stackoverflow and WSO2 ESB documentation for days but I have yet to come across any clear answer. p  pMy application is in JavaScript and using the Dojo framework. Ideally all the web services call should be make against REST and returns JSON. I know how to get the SOAP xml to come back as JSON because of this example 440 stronghttpwso2.orgprojectesbjava4.0.3docssamplesadvancedmediationsamples.htmlSample440strong  I have looked at the sample posted on this blog as well stronghttpvvratha.blogspot.ca201111invokingrestfulserviceviawso2esb.htmlstrong  I seems to be able to call the proxy service from tools like soapUI and get my result in JSON. So I can only assume that ESB is working properly strongHowever when I try to call it using dojo.xhrGet or dojo.io.script.get, the data returns as NULL alwaysstrongp  pWhat is the method in REST am I supposed to call for a ESB Proxy Service If I look at the wsdl of the service, the operation seems to call mediate but that did not get me any further. I have looked at example 800 stronghttpwso2.orgprojectesbjava4.0.3docssamplesrestapisamples.htmlSample800strong   but I am not clear where to use this.p  pNote Please add  after http for those http links.

Negative 1383 pI have accomplished developing an android app that uses the facebook sdk to integrate with Facebook. I have no issue or problem to solve at this point with the app as it is functional and runs nicely  but with that said I believe that even though the app is running, I still dont fully understand whats the android key hash. brbr 1 I understand the facebook sdk supplies the developer with a unique app id to know to whom their talking with so theyll also have control on whos who and such, but what do they gain out of having your android key hash br 2 I understand that my emulator on the development PC has a key hash which i got, and both Samsung Galaxy S1 and S2 which both have the same key hash have a different one, and now Ive passed the apk to another user which has a different key hash and a different phone brand and android version. So  if I publish my app on Google Play one day, will i be needing to update facebookdevelopers of all the possible hash keys br 3 Is the hash key unique and constant to a model or a platformandroid version, or can i generate a key hash from my app so i can add just that and make all the same app thats running from different phones use the same onebr 4again in general  i dont understand whats the key hash, who generates it, and most importantly why  whats the use of the key hash, and what good is it for facebook br Ive tried to search for it, but in here ive found just questions about the steps of knowing whats the emulator key hash or directions on what to do with Facebookdevelopers on Google. Im sure theres documentation that covers this, couldnt find it. Thanksp

Negative 1383 pId like to figure out a way to alert a python script that a file is done copying. Here is the scenario p  ol lipA folder, codetoprintcode is being watched by the script by constantly polling with codeos.listdircode. pli lipEvery time codeos.listdircode returns a list of files in which a file exists that hasnt been seen before, the script performs some operations on that file, which include opening it and manipulating its contents. pli ol  pThis is fine when the file is small, and copying the file from its original source to the directory being watched takes less time than the amount of time remaining until the next poll by codeos.listdircode. However, if a file is polled and found, but it is still in the process of being copied, then the file contents are corrupt when the script tries to act on it. p  pInstead, Id like to be able to using codeos.statcode or otherwise know that a file is currently being copied, and wait for it to be done until I act on it if so. p  pMy current idea is to use codeos.statcode every time I find a new file, then wait until the next poll and compare the date modifiedcreated time since the last time I polled, and if they remain the same then that file is stable, otherwise keep polling until it is. Im not sure this will work though as I am not too familiar with how LinuxUnix updates these values. p

Negative 1383 pSo... Im working on a chessgame, and trying to make it so that a public static boolean turn dictates which player can make a move. This boolean is in a class Board.as which imports all the classes for all the chesspieces e.g. QueenW.as for the White Queen.p  pIve tried multiple ways Trying to make functions not run anymore, and replacing the pieces which are buttons to other objects nonclickable movieclips. Decided to go with the latter. Ive traced the boolean in a chesspiece class, as well as the Boardclass, in an ENTERFRAME function. Both seem to trace it correctly when the value changes.p  pProblem is Flash doesnt remove the chesspieces and replaces them with a nonclickable object, even though the class in which it should happen Board.as does listen to the boolean when tracing.

Negative 1383 pTo demonstrate my problem, consider this simple program that does not compilep  precodeinclude ltboostnoncopyable.hppgt include ltunorderedmapgt  class foo  boostnoncopyable    int main      stdunorderedmapltint, foogt m     auto amp element  m[0]      return 0  codepre  pUsing the current version of boost 1.52, Visual Studio 2012 returns the error codecannot access private member declared in class boostnoncopyablenoncopyablecode.p  pThe operator [] for stdunorderedmap returns a reference to the element at the provided key, which at first glance seems like it should work  Ive asked for a reference to the element, not a copy of it.p  pMy understanding of the problem is this which might be wrong, as I havent used C in a while. If the key is not found, unorderedmap creates a new element and returns a reference to the new element. boostnoncopyable defines a private copy constructor but not a move constructor, and so a move constructor is not generated by the compiler. In its operator[], stdunorderedmap makes use of stdmove, but since boostnoncopyable doesnt define a move constructor, it falls back to the copy constructor. Since the copy constructor is private, the compilation fails.p  pWhat prompted this post is that Im trying to create an unorderedmap of boostsignal2signal, which inherits from boostnoncopyable. Short of hacking the boost library, is there a simple workaround I can do Wrapping the signal in a uniqueptr is an option, but it seems to me I might be doing something wrong here.p  h2Updateh2  pI may have posted too soon It appears impossible to add a subclass of boostnoncopyable to unorderedmap. Insert, operator[], and emplace all use either a copy constructor which is private, or a move operation which doesnt exist for boostnoncopyable. To me this seems a major limitation. Is it even possible to create an unorderedmap that contains boostnoncopyable objects Im explicitly emnotem trying to copy them  I want them to spend their entire lifespan inside the unorderedmap.p

Negative 1383 pi have 32bit and 64bit runtime libraries installed in different locations. the library files are named the same. now to make a 32bit application i need to specify the 32bit library path and similar thing for the 64bit. Is there a way to do something likep  precode  ifdef defined WIN64     include 64bit library path   else     include 32bit library path   endif codepre  pnow ifdef defined WIN64 for windows platform i have empirically checked that. And from my simple investigation i learnt that this may not be the best way to determine whether target application is 64bit or 32bit but the issue is not that over here. I want know if there is a way to have similar conditional statements to appropriately include the library paths. I am developing in windows using c visual studio 2010. Thanks in advancep

Negative 1383 pThis has been the bane of my week at the moment. Basically i have a pure CSS drop down menu that combines both standard lists and content boxes as sub menus. I am having trouble specifically in IE where each LI has an  tag that is display block, so should fill the parent LI. so i am able to hover and click anywhere in the LI and the links hover, active states are on. p  pwhats happening is in IE if i hover over the text the hover state styles are applied with no issue, however if i move the mouse off the text but still within the LI the hover is constantly being applied and then removed see a hrefhttpdev.altechuk.com relnofollowdev.altechuk.coma. p  pIt is slightly annoying because the submenus are then flickering on and off all the time and also you may miss the sub menu.

Negative 1383 pI have a website that is able to take payments from a user on multiple pages. I am originally a winforms coder so I am trying to centralize all of the fields that are requried for a payment in one custom user control. I have the user control all set up and ready to go and am now trying to implement validation using the JQuery plugin.p  pI originally tried putting the validation tied to the usercontrols child controls on the usercontrol itself and when the payment usercontrol was the only thing on the page it seemed to work as expected, the issue arose when there was other information aside from the payment that needed to be validated. p  pIt looked to me like since the form that contained all the controls only had one nameobviously the usercontrols validate declaration was wiping out the main pages validate declaration, because if I removed the custom controls validate declaration then the main pages validate worked as expected and vice versa.p  pI found a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2780288jqueryvalidationusingtheclassinsteadofthenamevaluethisa question which talks about manually adding validation to individual controls based on the class name of the control. When I tried doing that I was getting an error in the JQuery.validate.js file itself on codeifcommandvar settings.dataelement.form,validator.settingscode for what its worth After examining the values through my dev environment I found that the error is that code.dataelement.form,validatorcode is undeclared so it cant reference the settings. p  pForm and control declarationsp  precodeltform idMasterPageForm runatserver classentireFormgt     ltaspTextBox idtxtmoveInDate classtxtmoveInDate runatserver gt     ltmoPaymentDialog runatserver IDPaymentInput ClassNameSubmitPayment DisplayDescSubmit IsAmmountEditablefalse gt ltformgt codepre  pMain page Validation Declarationp  precode.validator.setDefaults document.readyfunction      aspnetForm.validate         rules        lttxtmoveInDate.UniqueIDgt   required true, date true                   messages        lttxtmoveInDate.UniqueIDgt                  required Please enter the move in date.,                 date Please enter a valid move in date.           codepre  pClass selector validation declarationp  precode.txtAccountnumber.rulesadd,       required true,      creditcard true,      minlength 15,      maxlength 16   .txtAccountnumber.messagesadd,      required You must supply the credit card account number.,     minlength Please enter a valid Credit Card account number.,     maxlength Please enter a valid Credit Card account number.,     creditcard Please enter a valid Credit Card account number.  codepre  pThats a very watered down version of the page but all other controls are declared the same way there are just too many of them to include here.

Negative 1383 pEDIT  I need to invoke one function which fetches data and reloads the pages contents. But this has to be invoked once another function has fetched datawebSql. I cannot use the WebSql callback as variables are out of scope. So I created a custom Event and added a listener in the second function scope.

Now the issue if the page was reloaded more than once, listeners will get added multiple times and all will be invoked which I dont want.p  pI need to make sure that only one function is listening to a custom event. Right now am removing the listener once its invoked like this p  precodedocument.addEventListenercustomEvent, function     actualCallBackvar1, var2  Since I need to pass parameters I need to use callBack within an anonymous function.   this.removeEventListenercustomEvent, arguments.callee, false , false codepre  pBut the problem is anonymous function will be removed only after its invoked in the first place.

To be more precisep  blockquote   pI invoke yyparse several times, and on correct input it works   properly but when a parse error is found, all the other calls fail   too. How can I reset the error flag of yyparsep blockquote  pMy parser and scanner run inside a separate thread, but there is only one thread working with the input file. In my understanding I dont need to write a reentrant scanner since there is only one thread working with the input file. In that page the problem is clearly explained but the solution is not clear to me. It saysp  blockquote   pTherefore, whenever you change yyin, you must tell the Lexgenerated   scanner to discard its current buffer and switch to the new one. This   depends upon your implementation of Lex see its documentation for   more. For Flex, it suffices to call YYFLUSHBUFFER after each   change to yyin. If your Flexgenerated scanner needs to read from   several input streams to handle features like include files, you might   consider using Flex functions like yyswitchtobuffer that   manipulate multiple input buffersp blockquote  pMy parser thread calls yyparse in order to build my AST. What is not clear to me is when and where I have to call yyflushbuffer to fix the problem. In my understanding the scanner code generated by Flex is called by the parser code generated by Bison. The Bison generated code is generated by the grammar. As a result the parser code is not under my direct control. This means I cannot include the call to yyflushbuffer into the parser code since it would be overwritten every time I generate the parser code by the grammar. It means that I should put the yyflushbuffer in the grammr file somewhere. But wherep

Negative 1383 pI have code that generates a certain value from 10 to 10 given a range from [0,1 The code takes the value from 10 to 10 and it will append it to a list, according to its probability.

Ive captured the results from each instance of the script to see if there were any roll backs documented but there are none.  So I have two theories. p  ol liThe server where these scripts are being executed is not robust enough and so the requests arent making it to the database server...li liThe database server is silently aborting transactions. li ol  pTo eliminate theory 1, Im going to set up two different servers and run the script once from each server, instead of opening up 2 commandlines on 1 server.  If the number of records created increases... I guess thatll tell me that performance on the current server is an issue. the server im currently running the scripts on is just a glorified desktop... so it could very well be the issue.p  pRegarding theory number 2, Ive been trying to read and understand a hrefhttpwww.postgresql.orgdocscurrentstaticexplicitlocking.html relnofollowhttpwww.postgresql.orgdocscurrentstaticexplicitlocking.htmla but since Im not a database expert, its taking me a little while to digest everything.

Negative 1383 pSo I have created a function that applies an action in this case point wise multiplication of an array with a sinusoid, but that does not matter for my question to an array. Now I have created another function with which I want to create a string of python code to apply the first function multiple times lateron. The input of the second function can be either a string or an array, so that I can use the second function on its own output as well, if need be. My method of getting the variable name in a string works outside of the function. p  pInputp  precodevar  np.array[[1,3],[2,4]]  or sometimes var  a string  if typevarstr     varname  var else     varname  [ k for k,v in locals.items if v is var][0]  varname codepre  pOutputp  precodevar codepre  pSo here var is the variable either array or string supplied to the function, in this case an array. The if statement nicely returns me its name.p  pHowever when I use this inside my function, no matter what input I give it, it actually seems to look for strongvarstrong in locals. Somehow it does not take strongvarstrong from the function input.p  pDefinitionp  precodedef functionTWOvar, listoflistsofargsNone     if typevarstr         varname  var     else         varname  [ k for k,v in locals.items if v is var][0]     if listoflistsofargsNone         return varname     command  []     for i in rangelenlistoflistsofargs         if i0             command.appendfunctionONE             command.appendvarname             command.append,.17f, .17f  tuplelistoflistsofargs[i]         else             command.insert0,functionONE             command.append,.17f, .17f  tuplelistoflistsofargs[i]     .joincommand     command[0]  varname      command[0]     return .joincommand codepre  pInputp  precodesomearray  np.array[[1,2,3],[1,2,3],[1,2,3]] args  [[1,3],[6,5]] command  functionTWOsomearray, args command codepre  pOutputp  precodeNameError name var is not defined codepre  pWanted outputp  precodefunctionONEfunctionONEsomearray, 1, 3, 6, 5 codepre  pWhy is listoflistsofargs taken from the function input and var not I specify var in the listcomprehension in the definition of functionTWO.

Negative 1383 pI have a php script that I got from another guy and for some reason the login function does not work unless it opens up in a new window.  no idea why but thats just how it is Anyways when I execute the open up window javascript from my PHP file, it opens up a whole bunch of windows. I figured that it was somehow looping, so I put the javascript function inside of a for loop that should only execute once. When I click my button, it opens up windows continously until I feverishly close them all and it stops. p  pHere is the code that seems to be the issuep  precode    ifbasenameSERVER[PHPSELF]USRFILE ampamp issetREQUEST[usr]  issetREQUEST[susr]  issetGET[mp]  issetREQUEST[rc]           ifISAJAX  0 includeUSRTEMPL.head.php         if not Ajax request, include head.php from USRTEMPL       includeUSRINCLS.class.UsersReg.php         include the class for Register used also for Recovery data        obstart            start storing output in buffer         if susrRegister, create objet of UsersReg for Register        if rc or mp for RecoverConfirma, uses UsersRecov class        if usr, create object of UserPage class for user page data       ifissetREQUEST[susr] ampamp REQUEST[susr]lsite[userslogform][register]          objRe  new UsersRegmysql         echo objRegtresult         forx  0 x lt 1 x2                   echo ltscript typetextjavascriptgtwindow.openhttpwww.thelegendmaker.netusers.phpsusrRegisterltscriptgt                       else ifissetREQUEST[rc]  issetGET[mp]          includeUSRINCLS.class.UsersRecov.php account recovery         objRe  new UsersRecovmysql             forx  0 x lt 1 x2                       echo ltscript typetextjavascriptgtwindow.openhttpwww.thelegendmaker.netusers.phprcRecoverltscriptgt                 codepre  pSpecifically this sectionp  precode  ifissetREQUEST[susr] ampamp REQUEST[susr]lsite[userslogform][register]      objRe  new UsersRegmysql     echo objRegtresult     forx  0 x lt 1 x2           echo ltscript typetextjavascriptgtwindow.openhttpwww.thelegendmaker.netusers.phpsusrRegisterltscriptgt      codepre  pI tried looking up javascript opening up many windows but didnt find anything noteworthy. Same goes when I looked up php opening up a whole bunch of windows. It really makes no sense why it is looking, because it was looping before I put the for loop in. I put in the for loop to stop it, and it still loops.p

Negative 1383 pIve got an image whose height is set as 100. This makes the image display correctly as I would expect so long as theres plenty of width. However, when the screens width is reduced eventually the image loses its ratio because the width is squished while the height still remains 100. I would like to have the image always stretch to the maximum size possible within the container without losing its ratio. In other words, it the width is the limiting factor, the image should use 100 width and maintain ratio, but if the height is the limiting factor, than the image should use 100 height while maintaining its ratio, and it should be able to switch between these. Is there a way to do this purely in CSS Thanksp

Negative 1383 pFirst of all, hello and thank you very much for taking the time to read. I have been implementing on Java since some years ago, but just one week ago I had to change to JavaFX. I need to implement a program with a long task and it is generating me some issues. I have read a lot and lots of QA on here helped me, but this issue has blocked me.p  pSo, onto the problem.p  pI have a panel with a progress bar that needs updating, and two labels a title and a message, that needs to change for each step of the task. So, here is the constructor  init method of the controller class for my FXML UIp  precodepublic class ProgressPanelController extends Controller  private SimpleIntegerProperty stepNumber   public ProgressPanelController       Call parent constructor     super       Initialize the property     stepNumber  new SimpleIntegerProperty   FXML private void initialize       Add a listener to the property     stepNumber.addListenernew ChangeListenerltNumbergt              Override            public void changedObservableValuelt extends Numbergt observableValue, Number oldValue, Number newValue                  Change the information on the panel                changeStepnewValue.intValue                          Link the progress bar     SimulatorTask st  new SimulatorTask     progressBar.progressProperty.bindst.progressProperty     stepNumber.bind st.getStepNumber      doingLabel.textProperty.bind st.messageProperty         Run the task     Platform.runLaterst  codepre  pAs you can see, I introduced myself to properties but I still dont know if I made that right. Anyways, this is part of my SimulatorTaskp  precodepublic class SimulatorTask extends TaskltObjectgt  private SimpleIntegerProperty stepNumber      Default constructor of the class.   public SimulatorTask       stepNumber  new SimpleIntegerProperty     stepNumber.set0     Override protected Object call throws Exception         Call first step     ComplexClass graced  step1       Call second step     step2graced      return null  codepre  pThe stepNumber property on the Task is binded to the one in the Controller class. So, here is the problem. The method step1 is executed perfectly, and is something like thisp  precode    private ComplexClass step1 throws Exception       Set the step     stepNumber.set1     updateMessageWaking up      ...      updateProgress66, 100      ...      updateProgress99, 100       ...      updateProgress100, 100       Return     return complexClass  codepre  pThe issue is the second step, that looks like thisp  precode    private void step2ComplexClass graced       Change the main information     stepNumber.set2       Get some variables     int current  0     int total  graced.getTotal     updateProgresscurrent, total        do           Update the progress         updateProgresscurrent, total           Execute an action         graced.start           Get the new current         current  graced.getCurrent          while graced.succeed    codepre  pThe issue is that graced.start executes a really long process. I cant make ComplexClass to extend Task because it already extends another class and due to some restrictions that goes beyond me I cant remove the original extending. So, if I comment the graced.start everything goes fine, with no bigger process happening. If I let the code happen, the whole UI hangsfreezes, no update is showing not even then ones of STEP1 and son seconds the UI changes to not responding but I can see that graced.start keeps executing on the backgroun because it prints with System.out.println. No exception is thrown, either.p  pI can think that maybe because ComplexClass does not extend TaskWorker it is causing the hanging on the UI, but it is beyond me to know how to stop that hanging.p  pAny help will be gladly appreciated.p  pThank you so much, and Im sorry for the Wall of textcode.p

Negative 1383 pI created a sidebar menu that, when hovered over with the mouse, expands outward. When the menu expands, the text inside of it simultaneously fades in. Likewise, when the mouse leaves the menu it contracts, and the text inside fades out. I have a JS fiddle here a hrefhttpjsfiddle.net6LdcC4 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.net6LdcC4ap  pThe problem is, this works when you treat it nicely. If you smoothly move the mouse into the sidebar it opens properly, and if you then move the mouse outside it closes properly. However, if you rapidly move the mouse into, out of, and back into the sidebar before it has finished animating, the text inside disappears. It will not reappear unless you refresh the page.p  pI suspect that this is a fault in the underlying jQuery, but I would love to be wrong so that I can fix it.

So I wrote code like thisp  precode        string Url  httpwww.example.com         HtmlWeb web  new HtmlWeb         web.UserAgent  Mozilla5.0 Windows NT 6.3 WOW64 AppleWebKit537.36 KHTML, like Gecko Chrome34.0.1847.131 Safari537.36         HtmlDocument doc  web.LoadUrl         doc.Savea.html codepre  pBut the problem is that the source of the website saved differs from the original. Is there a way to prevent changing the source. Or maybe theres another way to be able to move through the DOM and change just specific things like in chrome developer tools where you can save later as HTML, bu automatically.p  p EDIT p  pFor example it is seen on eBay. I cant post a link because it would be advertising but if you just try this code on any item offer you will see whats going on.p  p EDIT2 p  pIt seems that eBay is using iframes, and the HAP cant handle it. The  and  tags inside it are removed so probably that is the reason why saved website differs so much.p

Negative 1383 pA REST call uses spray.io.  It validates the request in that call using various functions including one in the middle that queries a data store.  If all is ok then it writes to said data store.  In this situation there are up to 4 IO actions HTTP request, data read, data write and HTTP response.  If I had decided to use the IO monad, how would I structure perform IO given I have some that may or may not be required i.e. read and write stuff may not need to be done if some validation fails interspersed with non IO functions  Presumably, first of all I could first ignore the spray stuff and think of the evaluation as starting after spray has done its thing.  But how do I compose the IO functions with nonIO functions  Do I have to lift the nonio stuff into an io monadp

GUI works fine, purely about the CardLayout. As you can see I created a main window with a JPanel inside acting as the holder of the card. I created a card and have added it too to CardLayout. But it already appears from the start of the program while it should only appear after pressing the button referring to the actionlistener where I put .show...p  pAny help appreciated. Not in a hurry either.p
Negative 1383 pstrongPROBLEMstrong p  pI have created custom ListView which contains custom View, and some textViews per List Item.

listview is not showp  pstrongNOTEstrongp  pIm sure that my save data is usable because this file is use for prevent fetching data from internet if available and I have test it already, it workp  pmy

Negative 1383 pIm trying to write a library that any process can use for logging. I want to have a dedicated worker thread in my class that writes log messages through some mechanism pipes, TCP sockets, whatever to another process on a remote machine, so that the code looks like this for the logging constructor the reason for doing it this way is so that you dont block the thread thats logging from stopping its execution in the event that the logging server is down on the remote machinep  precodepublic LogWriter      queueWriter  new Thread gt              while messageQueued.WaitOne                      Message message             while messageQueue.TryDequeueout message                              bool successful  false                 while successful                                      try                                              logger.PostMessagemessage                         successful  true                                          catch                                              try                                                      logger  new Logger                                                  catch                                                                        queueWriter.Start  codepre  pSo if you had an application, you could just log like thisp  precodeLogWriter logWriter  new LogWriter logWriter.DebugThis is an example of how youd send a debug log to the writer. This message would get translated into a Message object, queued up, and the dedicated writer would be signaled to start writing queued messages. codepre  pcodemessageQueuecode is a codeConcurrentQueueltMessagegtcode.I want codequeueWritercode to always stop ten seconds strongafter all other threads that Ive explicitly created in the process hosting it except for itself diestrong in order to give it some time to finish writing the logs it has in its codemessageQueuecode, but not to block the process from closing so after ten seconds, if it hasnt finished writing all its logs, we dont care anymore, just stop the thread.p  pNotesp  ul liMaking codequeueWritercode a background thread isnt good enough. I dont want to kill codequeueWritercode when the parent thread dies, because it may not have had enough time to finish writing its pending logs.li liSubscribing to codeProcess.GetCurrentProcess.Exitedcode is not good enough, either. The codequeueWritercode thread keeps the process up.li liId like for it to be usable as a library, and I dont want developers to have to manually signal the worker to stop after ten seconds on shutdown of their application or process. I just want to be able to track when all the threads except for the worker thread are dead, wait ten seconds, and then shut down the worker thread.li liProcess.GetCurrentProcess.Threads.Count may be handy, but doing some tests with it, it gives you all the threads your application uses like unmanaged threads, library threads, and even threads that you havent explicitly created yourself, in the sense that you havent written code to start that thread explicitly.li ul  pSo how can this be done Is it even possiblep

The codeHTMLStripCharFilterFactorycode filter has a bug that makes it not usable in this scenario see a hrefhttpsissues.apache.orgjirabrowseSOLR2834 relnofollowhttpsissues.apache.orgjirabrowseSOLR2834a.  The bug makes the solrj client not able to handle the response from an analysis request to solr.  It is a bug in all versions of solr 4 as far as I can tell and it doesnt look like it is going to be fixed any time soon.  I also dont actually use the codeHTMLStripCharFilterFactorycode.  It was previously put in place but then never used.  As a result I have a blocking, unused feature in my schema that I want to remove.p  pI have a test environment with a copy of all of the data which I have experimented with.  In my test, I stopped the tomcat server that was running solr, removed that codeltcharFiltergtcode line, and restarted tomcat.  I did not see any negative impact from the change and now solrj is able to properly handle things and I get the results I am expecting.  At this point I feel like I can just make the change to schema.xml and that is all I need to do.p  pHowever, when I read pages like a hrefhttpwiki.apache.orgsolrHowToReindex relnofollowhttpwiki.apache.orgsolrHowToReindexa it makes it sound like I would need to reindex because Im changing schema.xml.p  pSo in the end, can anyone verify if I would need to reindex or not  What are the risks, if any, to making this change to schema.xml without reindexingp

Negative 1383 pPlease, help for this long, long storyp  pI have one Windows file server server, with a shared path folder, with full access rights. In this directory it exists two file file.wav and file.pk.p  pAlso I have a web page with a simple link  any combination of file URI [back]slashes does the same results, on a Windows 7 client workstation, with IE 10.p  pWeb server it is an Apache but IIS make same results, on separate Windows server.p  pThe three computers are on the same network.p  pOk ... I want to open modify and save later on the client workstation, the file.wav from shared folder serverfolder with Adobe Audition 3.0 it is windows assigned for wavs, through web page hosted by web server.p  pWhen I acces this link, Adobe Audition 3.0 is opening fine, but it seems like first processing, when .pk does not exists, altough I have preprocessed the .wav. So the process it is very slow and I need speed. I will mention that Adobe Audition uses a .pk file that is a picture, for showing in a fast way the waveform of a .wav file. When Adobe loads for the first time .wav file, it makes .pk file with the same path and name like .wav file and the process is slow. Next time just loads .pk file from disk and no wav processing is madep  pHowever, if Ill try to save modified .wav from just opened Adobe Audition, the dialog box indicates serverfolder, so  I can directly rewrite .wav file from Adobe Audition. I think that working directory is ok.p  pBut if I call Adobe Audition 3.0 from command line, like audition.exe serverfolderfile.wav, everything is fine Adobe Audition read .pk file and opening process is very fast.p  pOk, I have tried other thing I made a script bat which show input parameter, lists all files with same path and name like first input parameter, copy .pk file with a changed extension and call AdobeAudition with proper input parameter. Of course, calling web link with the script, .bat is functioning ok, but Adobe Audition 3.0 notp  pMore of that, Adobe Audition CS5 is working very good, but this is not the solution, because it exists client workstation where Adobe Audition 3.0 is working properly. The next check, desperately, was to check IE version. It is not a rule. p  pI dont understand what it is. Can anybody tell me which is the mechanism Where I must focus my attention Can I open file.wav from shared resources, via web page, with Adobe Audition 3.0, considering .pk filep  pThank You,p  pTBp

No matter what I try, I cannot seem to get the text box to update until the long method has completed.  I have tried threading  using the controls dispatcher etc.  In the example below, I have reverted back to simply hiving off the long method to a thread but it still wont work.  The TextStatus textbox never gets updated until after the long method LoadDevices has completed.  Can someone tell me how to do this  Any help much appreciated.   p  precode    private void UpdateButtonClickobject sender, RoutedEventArgs e              UpdateStatusSearching for devices, please wait . . .         var t  new ThreadLoadDevices         t.Start                       private void UpdateStatusstring status              TextStatus.AppendTextstatus         TextStatus.InvalidateVisual      codepre

Negative 1383 pIn the following code sample executed on .NET 4.5.1 or .NET 4.5.2 same results, something strange happens when the code queries a nonexistent variable.  Another, perfectly existent variable myvar whose value is an empty string, will stop being seen through a call to codeGetEnvironmentVariablecode, but it is still seen via iteration of the whole environment.p  pThis behavior probably cannot be recreated purely using .NET APIs because they dont allow setting an environment variable to an empty string but the native APIs allow that.p  pIt feels very strange that a call to codeEnvironment.GetEnvironmentVariablecode would make another variable disappear, or halfdisappear, from the environment.p  pThe behavior with target framework set to .NET 2.0 is subtly different.  The mismatch between getting codemyvarcode directly, and iteration, occurs immediately after the native call to codeSetEnvironmentVariablecode  it is not necessary to query for another variable to see it.p  pstrongEditstrong Adding codeCharsetCharSet.Autocode, as kindly suggested by Hans Passant thanks reduces the craziness level of .NET 4.5.x to that of .NET 2.0, exactly as described in the previous paragraph, apart from fixing Unicode handling.  The codeDllImportcode is also missing a codeSetLastErrorcode parameter, but this is just an artificial example and we know that this native call is successful on the Win32 level.  So, so far no explanation.

Negative 1383 pCurrently, I am doing some research on Linux task scheduler behaviour. I have some questions to be clarifiedp  ol lipIn the case of Multicore architecture, a scheduler thread kernel thread is running per core OR  a central kernel scheduler is running on a dedicated core to handle all scheduling task.pli lipHow frequent a typical scheduler tick interrupt happens, and what is a typical timeslice for a task thread of a particular priority pli lipAfter a scheduler tick , is it mandatory to execute another task  from the runqueue, even though the current task does not finish its timeslicepli ol  h1Partial answer of the question 2 bThanks to Dervin Thunkbh1  pCFS which is default scheduler for processes has no fixed timeslice.This timeslice always in between   between sysctlschedmingranularity and sysctlschedlatency epoch length. That means the timeslice cant be less then  sysctlschedmingranularity. The default value of these parameters are 0.75 ms and 6 ms respectively and defined in kernelschedfair.c.p  pAlong the line  The CFS scheduler calculates the timeslices for a given task just before it is scheduled for execution. Its length is variable dynamic and depends directly on its static priority and the current load of the running queue, i.e. the number and priority of the tasks in the queue  p
Negative 1383 pI have a problem here. Is there a way to programmatically find out the moment a certain thread exits I mean, even the VS debugger gives you that info in its Output window. I know that I simply could make my thread to raise an event but this of course leads to a problem when you spawn more than one thread, so each of them will raise that event, unless you use some toggle variable to make sure that only the first thread to reach that point in code will raise the event.p  pHere is the beginning of a method that is executed in multiple threads, with cancellation, pause and exit logic shown here. The problem spots of code are the calls to the event handlers DownloadComplete, DownloadPaused and DownloadCanceled. As you can see, some of them will be executed only once by the first thread that reaches that point and then toggles related bool variables, so other threads wont raise this event again. Another big problem here is the thread exit logic, when the thread doesnt find an item to download and returns with rasing that download complete event which of course will be fired by each thread. Both of these approaches are incorrect and I currently have no any idea how to implement my intended behavior. All I need is to have a clue how to find out a way to catch the momement when the last of the all of spawned thread ends so I could raise all of the mentioned above events just once.p  pPlease note that I have no acess to the types from the System.Threading.Tasks namespace as my project is targeted against .net 2.0. This is my very first experiece with programming something more complex than some class assignment, so I realize that this code is most likely all sorts of terrible.p  pSorry for my English.p  precode    private void PerformDownload              while true                      if askedToCancel                              lock lockObj                                      if cancellationPerformed                                              cancellationPerformed  true                          foreach DownloadItem di in itemsToProcess                             if di.Status  DownloadItemStatus.Prepared                                 itemsToProcess.UpdateItemStatusdi.URL, DownloadItemStatus.Canceled                          DownloadCanceled                                                        return                           if askedToPause                              lock lockObj                                      if pausingPerformed                                              foreach DownloadItem di in itemsToProcess                             if di.Status  DownloadItemStatus.Prepared                                 itemsToProcess.UpdateItemStatusdi.URL, DownloadItemStatus.Paused                          DownloadPaused                                                        waitHandle.WaitOne                           DownloadItem currentItem  null              lock lockObj                              foreach DownloadItem di in itemsToProcess                     if di.Status  DownloadItemStatus.Prepared                                              currentItem  di                         itemsToProcess.UpdateItemStatuscurrentItem.URL, DownloadItemStatus.Downloading                         break                                                if currentItem  null                              DownloadComplete                 return              codepre

Negative 1383 pBased on the code below amp using bootstrap, I have a grid layout with multiple code.blockcode components, each containing an image and a title. The images are larger than the column size so that they can resize to full width for responsive screen sizes done with the CSS listed below. each image may be different heights amp widths. p  pThis works just fine as long as you dont define the image height in the attributes. As soon as you add the height it distorts the image proportions.p  pNow however, I need to set the image heights for some javascript so that it loads properly. Without setting the heights, the js is loading too quickly and the element heights are incorrect basically. p  pRight now Im getting around this by using a codesetTimeoutcode to delay the js script by 1.5 seconds. This obviously isnt ideal as for someone with a slow connection it wont be long enough. p  pstrongMy Questionstrong Is there a way to either A delay the js until all images have loaded on the page or B set the height for each image in a way that it will resize with the image width and keep my proportions correct for the image with css p  pstrongHTMLstrongp  precodeltdiv classcontainergt     ltdiv classrowgt         ltdiv classcollg3 colmd4 colsm6 colxs12gt             ltdiv classblockgt                 ltimg srcimgimage.jpg altimagegt                 lth2gtImage Titlelth2gt             ltdivgt         ltdivgt         ltdiv classcollg3 colmd4 colsm6 colxs12gt             ltdiv classblockgt                 ltimg srcimgimage1.jpg altimagegt                 lth2gtImage Titlelth2gt             ltdivgt         ltdivgt         ltdiv classcollg3 colmd4 colsm6 colxs12gt             ltdiv classblockgt                 ltimg srcimgimage2.jpg altimagegt                 lth2gtImage Titlelth2gt             ltdivgt         ltdivgt         ltdiv classcollg3 colmd4 colsm6 colxs12gt             ltdiv classblockgt                 ltimg srcimgimage3.jpg altimagegt                 lth2gtImage Titlelth2gt             ltdivgt         ltdivgt         ltdiv classcollg3 colmd4 colsm6 colxs12gt             ltdiv classblockgt                 ltimg srcimgimage4.jpg altimagegt                 lth2gtImage Titlelth2gt             ltdivgt         ltdivgt         ltdiv classcollg3 colmd4 colsm6 colxs12gt             ltdiv classblockgt                 ltimg srcimgimage5.jpg altimagegt                 lth2gtImage Titlelth2gt             ltdivgt         ltdivgt         ltdiv classcollg3 colmd4 colsm6 colxs12gt             ltdiv classblockgt                 ltimg srcimgimage6.jpg altimagegt                 lth2gtImage Titlelth2gt             ltdivgt         ltdivgt         ltdiv classcollg3 colmd4 colsm6 colxs12gt             ltdiv classblockgt                 ltimg srcimgimage7.jpg altimagegt                 lth2gtImage Titlelth2gt             ltdivgt         ltdivgt         ltdiv classcollg3 colmd4 colsm6 colxs12gt             ltdiv classblockgt                 ltimg srcimgimage8.jpg altimagegt                 lth2gtImage Titlelth2gt             ltdivgt         ltdivgt         ltdiv classcollg3 colmd4 colsm6 colxs12gt             ltdiv classblockgt                 ltimg srcimgimage9.jpg altimagegt                 lth2gtImage Titlelth2gt             ltdivgt         ltdivgt     ltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pstrongCSSstrongp  precode.block img     maxwidth 100  codepre

Negative 1383 pWell Ive been trying to find out the difference between data mapper and repository, but up to now I still have not. It seems to me that the expert programmer said Repository is another layer of abstraction over the mapping layer where query construction code is concentrated. It seems understandable but is still somewhat very abstract. I read this article on stackoverflow before, and it just made me even more confused a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13550690howisthedatamapperpatterndifferentfromtherepositorypatternHow is the Data Mapper pattern different from the Repository Patternap  pI guess what I need are simple explanations and concretepractical examples on how the two patterns differ, and what a repository does what a data mapper doesnt, and vice versa. Do anyone of you know a good example on illustrating the concept of data mapper and repository It will be better if its the same example, just one using data mapper and another using repository. Thanks, Id very appreciate this. I am still very confused as of now... p

Negative 1383 pIm working on a script that is meant to check a certain status, output the result, sleep for a short time and then start everything over again.

I was thinking about scrolling the window so that the prompt is at the top line before I start outputting but that would require the current cursor row and I cant see how to get that with codetputcode.p  pAlternatively, I could remember the number of lines that were printed and then move the cursor back using codetput rincode. However, that doesnt work when the output is too long and gets broken across two or more terminal lines.p

This works, but it means I cant test more than one tenant in a debug session.p  pIve tried using wildcards in the bindingInformation, but it doesnt seem to work.p  pIs there any way to make this kind of testing less tediousp

Negative 1383 pWe run a large amount of tests with java webdriver every day. We use TestNG, and we use bat files to execute the TestNG XMLs, using the classed compiled by Eclipse. Im wondering, though, if theres a better way to do this. Since we run hundreds thousands of test cases daily, we have to resort creating testng XMLs that execute entire packages, otherwise wed have to manually create an xml for each test, and thats not practical. p  pOne problem with executing such large tests containing hundreds of classes is that if theres one major issue such as webdriver stalling or hanging, the entire test will not run. Also, we have a listener that uploads to a server at the end of the test, so we have to wait hours for all results to be uploaded at once something more in real time would be better. Another problem is if the VMs reboot for whatever reason, all progress is lost and wed have to run the tests from the beginning.p  pIve seen Ant builds mentioned around the testng website, but Im not sure what the advantages of ant would be over just using the bat files to execute the XMLs. Can anyone shed light on this Or offer any solutions for executing a large number of tests with something more elegant than bat filesp  pThanksp

Negative 1383 pI have a TcpClient object which can connect to a foreign program.  I can send one message xml serialized message.  But as soon as I close my network stream my TcpClient closes and disposes.  And the second time I try to send a message via my TcpClient I get an error cannot access a disposed object, Net.Sockets.Socket.p  pI am new to using TcpClient but I was under the impression I would connect once with the other program then be able to pass messages back and forth for the lifetime of my program and simply disconnect the TcpClient before closing my program. p  pThe only way Ive been able to send multiple messages is if I strongnewstrong the TcpClient, and perform the connect again prior to sending my message.  Is this the correct way of sending multiple messages and my manager and I are simply under the wrong impression of TcpClient p  pAnother impression I had regarding TcpClient was that once connected Id be able to receive messages from the other program.  So my program would be sitting there doing nothing then receive a TcpClient message some defined xml message stating inventory has been changed.  Is this possible or do I need to set up a TcpListener for that type of functionality to workp  pBRBR Please dont let this example confuse you or the issue Im just trying to get my impression across in a different way. An example of what my impression was is a phone conversation.  The TcpClient is the phone and I make a connection by calling another phone number.  I would then be connected and be able to talk back and forth. There may be pauses of several minutes before one of us starts the conversation back up again.  Then at the end of the work day would hang up the phone.  p  pBut after working with TcpClient for a while Im getting the impression that its a walkietalkie conversation.  I connect via TcpClient which is my pressing the walkietalkie button.  I talk, and the closing of the network stream is me releasing the button.  I can hear back from the person on the other side of the conversation but as soon as I press the button again it changes frequency and its an entirely new conversation requiring me to strongnewstrong the tcpClient.p  pBRBR strongEDITstrongp  pEveryone that said not to close the stream was right.  The reason I kept closing the stream was because the receiver software would then process my message.  But the receiving software was also looking for a message to be wrapped in the ASCII STX and ETX characters.  If I wrapped my message, sent it along and lo and behold they started processing the message with my stream still open.p

Negative 1383 pI have been presented with what seems to be quite a challenging design, I cant seem to find a solution in my own head so I am reaching out to the community to see if anyone has come across a similar problem.p  pI have an eCommerce store that has a category landing page, the markup is similar to the markup above, although the markup above has been simplified for the purpose of the question. The content is generated by PHP so it needs to be setup this way as its in a foreach loop.p  pThe idea is that you have this responsive grid ranging from 1 item to 20itemsif necessary it is displaying information about the category that is corresponds to, it is a minified version. When you click on the View More buttonlink then a further panel drops down thus displaying more detailed information. My problem is that because the items are a fixed width, and they are all floating left so as they are displayed in a grid, my subcategory drop is then bound by the parent container, is there any way of getting this drop down panel to display full width outside of its parent container below the grid itemsSee Diagram, and also not be absolutely positioned as I would like the grid items below the drop down panel to be pushed down with some jQuery.p  pdiv classsnippet datalangjs datahidetrue div classsnippetcode snippetcurrentlyhidden pre classsnippetcodehtml langhtml

Negative 1383 pstrongOverviewstrongp  pI have been working for quite some time trying to find a post that addresses my particular situation, but have come up empty. I am attempting to create a C .NET console application that will parse an XML file with multiple database restore definitions, and then subsequently launch those restores in parallel using SQL Management Objects. After each restore, the user may specify zero to many SQL files that they would wish to run against the newly restored database. Whenever I attempt more than 4 of these jobs in parallel, the static method handling the execution of SQL files against the database chokes on calling the ExecuteNonQuery method against the locally created ServerConnection.
