Positive 38948 pI have a MapViewController class and I set thep  precodemapView.delegate  self codepre  pin viewDidLoad. When I first load the map, annotations are rendered correctly. However, after a refresh e.g., after I hit a button in callout  say delete, all the other pins lose their images and are rendered red.p  pIn my refresh method, I remove all annotationsp  precodemapView.removeAnnotationsmapView.annotations codepre  pand then recreate the annotations in the same manner I created them on initial load.p  pThis code was working fine until today, when I upgraded to Swift 2.0. Was I simply lucky until now or am I missing a new piece of codep  pI even tried forcing the pin to default to Green. But no matter what I do set an image or change colour, post refresh, all pins are red p

Positive 38948 pI am trying to have 3 different annotation views for each of the 3 custom annotations I have.

Positive 38948 pI have an SWRevealController that has a front view composed of a Navigation controller that contains a container view controller with children table view controller and map view controller. p  pProblem when my map view is the visible child on my front view, I tap the menu button to reveal my menu. When the menu is visible, attempting to do a pan gesture to push the menu back out of view causes the map to pan, but no SW reveal behavior occurs. However, I can tap the menu button to hide menu.p  pI tried disabling the front views gestures when the menu is visible. This works in allowing me to swipe away the menu, but disables my menu button since its part of the front view. I would like both to work.p  pI have an idea I could make my nav controller overlay its contents with a clear UIView to block anything underneath from moving does this work. But how do I inform my Navigation controller that the menu is visiblep  pI tried changing the class type of the SWRevealControllers FrontView to a custom class, but it wouldnt let me...not sure why.Ill post the error in a bit. I am also considering issuing a notification when the menu is active to inform my views to disable gestures Not sure what the best approach is here.p  pIf anyone has any other suggestions, I am open to themp

Positive 38948 pIm using an MKMapView to allow the user to select a delivery location, much like the Uber app where the pin is in the centre and you drag around to select the location. p  pEverything works, but for some reason the first time I load the view with the map, it puts the centre pin in the middle of the atlantic ocean 0,0. When I got to a different view and come back to the map it works as expected and puts the centre pin at the current location of the user. Its worth noting that the view with the MKMapView is the first displayed view to the user, although technically not the root view controller  thats a UINavigationController.p  pThe maps have worked perfectly fine and gone to the user location before in other apps ive built, but theyve not included this centre pin.

Positive 38948 pI am developing an app with a map view. The map view should have annotations, but the pin should always be centred and the map should scroll under it. For that, instead of adding annotation to map, I added a codeUIViewcodewith a pin image as background as subview to my view controllers view. Now the map view and the codeUIViewcode are in the same hierarchy. The codeUIViewcode is centred and the map will scroll under it. Is there a better solutionp  pNow the problem I am facing with is the callout accessory. I have the tap event on the codeUIViewcode, where I can create a another codeUIViewcode as callout accessory. But what would be the best option to create a callout accessory in my case. Any ideas are welcome.p

Can someone confirm if manual modifications are necessary The least amount of manual changes we have to make to our converted ESQLC programs, the better.p  pSecond, we have several queries which pull dates from various tables etc., and in Informix dates are treated as type long, the  of days since Dec 31st, 1899. p  pIn ProC, what format is a date being selected as I know its not numeric because I tried selecting date field into my long variable and get Oracle error stating expected NUMBER but got a DATE. So Im assuming wed have to modify how we are selecting date fields  either select a date field in a converted manner so it becomes a long ie,  of days since 12311899, or change the host variable to match what Oracle is returning what is that, string.p

Negative 38948 pWere setting up a reporting service for a website, and right now Im leaning towards using SSRS...but Im trying to make sure it will really do everything we need.

Negative 38948 pFollow up question to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1223040ctimersinunixThis questionap  pAs described in the linked question, we have an API that uses an event look that polls select to handle user defined callbacks.  p  pI have a class using this like suchp  precodeclass example  public     example         Timer theTimer1   TimerEventcreatetimeInterval,ampexampleFunctionName         Timer theTimer2   TimerEventcreatetimeInterval,ampexampleFunctionName         start        coutltltpthreadselfltltendl        private      void start         whiletrue            ifcondition               FunctionName            sleep1                     void FunctionName          coutltltpthreadselfltltendl          Do stuff        codepre  pThe idea behind this is that you want FunctionName to be called both if the condition is true or when the timer is up.  Not a complex concept.  What I am wondering, is if FunctionName will be called both in the start function and by the callback at the same time  This could cause some memory corruption for me, as they access a nonthread safe piece of shared memory.  p  pMy testing tells me that they do run in different threads corruption only when I use the events, even though codecoutltltpthreadselfltltendlcode says they have the same thread id. p  pCan someone explains to me how these callbacks get forked off  What order do they get exectued  What thread do they run in  I assume they are running in the thread that does the select, but then when do they get the same thread id     p

Negative 38948 pWe have a need to generate Java source code. We do this by modeling the abstract syntax tree and have a tree walker that generate the actual source code text. This far all good.p  pSince my AST code is a bit old, it does not have support for annotations and generics. So Im looking around for open projects to use for future projects with code generation needs. And this is where the actual issue comes. We want to test that the code generated has the correct behavior.p  pHere is where I got the idea to actually evaluate the AST instead of generating the java source code, compile it, and run tests against that code. An evaluator would speed up the unit tests, and one could evaluate smaller pieces of generated code, such as only a method, making the units more reasonable.p  pSo far i have found the com.sun.codemodel project that seems quite nice as for being a modern support for java5 and 6 features AST based codegenerating solution.p  pAnyone know if there is another project that would allow me to evaluate pieces of AST directly such as a single generated methodp

Negative 38948 pI am Using Visual Studio 2008 sp1 for a WPF application with Visual Basic.  I am trying to use the line Imports System.Deployment.Application so I can use ApplicationDeployment to create a button to manual check and install updates to my application.

I have constantly researched this and I cant figure out why this isnt working especially considering I am using common methods to create a button to check for and install updates.

Negative 38948 pI have a Message entity that has a messageID property. Id like to ensure that theres only ever one instance of a Message entity with a given messageID. In SQL, Id just add a unique constraint to the messageID column, but I dont know how to do this with Core Data. I dont believe it can be done in the data model itself, so how do you go about itp  pMy initial thought is to use a validation method to do a fetch on the NSManagedObjects context for the ID, see if it finds anything but itself, and if so, fails the validation. I suspect this will work  but Im worried about the performance of something like that. I went through a lot of effort to minimize the fetch requests needed for the entire import routine, and having it validate by performing a fetch for every single new message entity seems a bit excessive. I can get all preexisting objects I need and identify all the new objects I need to insert into the store using just two fetch queries before I do the actual work of importing and connecting everything together. This would add a fetch to every single update or insert in addition to those two  which would seem to eliminate any performance advantage I had by preprocessing the import data in the first placep  pThe main reason this is an issue is that the importer can potentially run several batches concurrently on several threads and may include some overlappingduplicate data that needs to ultimately result in just one object in the store and not duplicate entries. Is there a reasonable way to do this and does what Im asking for make sense for Core Datap

This is all fine and dandy, so far I have been defining the properties of the form in a hardcoded way, basically matching a property to a certain form a ChoiceField, a Boolean, etc. BUT, what I would like instead of hardcoding these values is essentially create a properties dictionary dynamically, based on what information I pass it...p  pI basically have an array of options, and so here are the two methods I am consideringp  ol liHave a function for my options modelobject that will have a series of ifelses.

Returns 0 on error, 1 if indices found, 2 if exact index is found. uint8t findindicesuint16t ADCreading,                      const TempADCt table[],                     int8t dir,                      uint16t indexlow,                      uint16t indexhigh,                      uint16t indexmid,                      uint16t tablesize      uint8t found  0     uint16t mid, low, high     low  0     high  tablesize  1      iftable  NULL ampamp tablesize gt 0 ampamp indexlow  NULL ampamp        indexmid  NULL ampamp indexhigh  NULL              whilefound  0                      mid  low  high  2              iftable[mid].ADC  ADCreading                                  exact match                                        found  2                                      else iftable[mid].ADC lt ADCreading                              iftable[mid  dir].ADC  ADCreading                                       exact match                               found  2                     mid  mid  dir                                                               else iftable[mid  dir].ADC gt ADCreading                                       found the two indices                     found  1                     low  dir  1 mid  mid  dir                     high  dir  1 mid  dir  mid                                                              else iftable[mid  dir].ADC lt ADCreading                                                           low  dir  1 mid  dir  low                     high  dir  1  high  mid  dir                                                         else iftable[mid].ADC gt ADCreading                              iftable[mid  dir].ADC  ADCreading                                       exact match                               found  2                     mid  mid  dir                                                               else iftable[mid  dir].ADC lt ADCreading                                       found the two indices                     found  1                     low  dir  1 mid  dir  mid                     high  dir  1 mid  mid  dir                                                              else iftable[mid  dir].ADC gt ADCreading                                      low  dir  1 low  mid  dir                     high  dir  1  mid  dir  high                                                         indexlow  low         indexhigh  high         indexmid  mid                   return found      This function uses the lookup table provided as an input argument to find the  temperature for a ADC value using linear approximation.

Negative 38948 pIve found a workaround, but I am completely perplexed by an issue I ran into with Adobe Air and SQLite. An codeUPDATEcode query that I believe worked correctly earlier in the development process suddenly started failing with the error codedetailscould not convert text value to numeric value., operationexecute, detailID2300code. Several hours later I found that if I included a pretty irrelevant column in the query, setting it to an arbitrary value, the problem went away. As luck would have it, this did not affect the business logic in any meaningful way, so Im going to leave it as is. However, I detest mysteries like this. Can anyone think of what might have happened p  pEdit Sorry, I made a mistake in my code. The last two queries were identical in my original post. In fact, the codeUPDATEcode query only worked when I also added codelocked  nullcode or codelocked  0code to the query. If I didnt set this value, the query would fail. I did just about everything I could to get around this, including rebuilding the database file.p  pHeres the table definitionp  precodeCREATE TABLE cars      carid INTEGER  PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT DEFAULT NULL,     cargroupid NUMERIC,     startingordinal NUMERIC,     endingordinal NUMERIC,     locked NUMERIC  codepre  pThis query has always workedp  precodevar query  new Query     UPDATE cars SET locked  carid   WHERE cargroupid  ,     [intCarId,intCargroupId],     success,failure  codepre  pThis query failed with the above error [edit]p  precodevar query  new Query      UPDATE cars SET startingordinal  , endingordinal  , cargroupid   WHERE carid  ,     [         parseIntobjPayout.startingordinal,10,         parseIntobjPayout.endingordinal,10,         parseIntobjPayout.cargroupid,10,         parseIntobjPayout.carid,10     ],     success,failure  codepre  pI solved the problem by changing the query to thisp  precodevar query  new Query     UPDATE cars SET startingordinal  , endingordinal  , cargroupid  , locked  null WHERE carid  ,     [         parseIntobjPayout.startingordinal,10,         parseIntobjPayout.endingordinal,10,         parseIntobjPayout.cargroupid,10,         parseIntobjPayout.carid,10     ],     success,failure  codepre

Negative 38948 pFor one of my classes, Im writing a program thats going to be using a templated memory pool structure to handle the allocation of new instances of a class while keeping them together.  It is currently declared as followsp  precodetemplatelttypename T, unsigned int Ngt class MemoryPool      Stuff  codepre  pWhere codeTcode is the class to create this pool for and codeNcode is the maximum number of elements that can be placed in the pool.  I want to overload codenewcode for the created type to make interactions with the pool a bit easier if its a reasonable thing to dobut Im not sure if it is.p  pMy thoughts, currently, are that if its possible to overload codenewcode as a friend function for codeTcodewithin codeMemoryPoolcode that it emshouldem be doable from there but Im not sure.  And, Im not sure of the best way to start setting that up.  Ive tried a few different ways to just declare the overloaded codenewcode and Im getting errors before even implementing it.p  ul liIs this a reasonable way to ensure that codenewcode is overridden for any class that uses codeMemoryPoolcode li liIs doing so even possible li liIs doing so even a good ideali liemHowem would I set up the function declaration to accomplish thisli ul  pIn case it matters, Im using Visual Studio 2010.p  pNote, the specific use of templates and overloading codenewcode are emnotem part of the homework assignment.  Its just how I want to implement it if possible to make the rest of the assignment easier to read for the future.  So, if theres no reasonable way to do it, I just use member functions within codeMemoryPoolcode to accomplish the same goal.p  pThanksp  pExample implementationp  precodeMemoryPoolltObject, MAXOBJECTSgt objectPool  Pool to store objects Object  allObjects[MAXOBJECTS]            Locations of objects  Make a new object this is how Id like to do it allObjects[0]  new Objectargs  If I cant do the above, this would be the alternative allObjects[0]  objectPool.AllocateNewSlot allObjects[0]gtInitializeargs codepre  pIn this example, the use of the codeMemoryPoolcode takes care of the actual implementation of codenewcode ensuring the Object is created in its pool instead of just anywhere on the heap to ensure all the Objects are in a centralized, more controllable location.p

Negative 38948 pstrongtldr versionstrong I need a sexy session and authentication handler for a publicly accessible, internal company tool. Should I create my own or is there an existing tool everyone finds dreamyp  pHere are my specificsp  pstrongAuthenticationstrong Ive spent the past few weeks studying up on the dangers of user security in PHP and it seems the further down the rabbit hole you dive, the more there is to learn. I feel confident that I can write a system that rotates sessions on every request, can prevent XSS and XSRF, and generally protect my backend fairly well. Im hesitant to look into existing tools simply because its easier to trust and blame yourself than someone else.p  pstrongSession Handlingstrong The more I looked into security, the more pragmatic it seemed that its smarter to use session handling inside a database instead of native to PHP. That way, you can build and monitor ACLs easier, clustering, etc.p  pMy concern with a database structure is that if there are a few hundred people hammering on this database at a time altering their sessionids every page call, I could run into some performance issues at scale.p  pOriginally I was planning on creating my own classes for this in PHP and use MySQL as the backend. Now Im worried that MySQL would have concurrency issues. Ive looked into NoSQL like MongoDB, but then I paralyze myself thinking that I may be OVERTHINKING the whole damn thing. Then after the brain freeze pain is over, I start to think someone has to have already done this and I guarantee theyve thought of everything Im too stupid to consider.p  pIm hoping there are greater minds out there that have encountered the same questions I am facing and have some advice for me. Is there something out there that you would trust for this type of purpose or should I continue down the path of writing my own and if so which tools do you think are the best option for such a taskp  pIf you made it this far, thank you very much for your time and I look forward to hearing the thoughts of the community on thisp

Negative 38948 pemNOTE I can certainly bruteforce this myself by making a class that implements INotifyCollectionChanged, but it feels like something thats already been solved, and I just havent looked in the right places yet.emp  pIn a few places in my viewmodel, I have collections that are effectively some particular entity set off of my domain context well call it SomeEntitySet with some small handful of special instances added to it at the front, at the end, sometimes both.  Currently I implement this as a simple ObservableCollection well call it SupplementedEntitySet and whenever I update the particular entity set, I have the callback also repopulate this SupplementedEntitySet.  The entity set off of the domain context is readonly, so I cant add the special instances there and I really wouldnt want to anyway, as I dont want them written back to the database.p  pFor this scenario, lets assume 1 I dont want to modify the RIA query to include these special entities 2 I dont want to include binding converters at use sites to add them, etc.p  pWhile you likely wouldnt use this particular mechanism to do so, as an example scenario, lets say you have a list of categories coming back from the RIA call, but you want the collection to which you bind your combobox to have a special All items category as well and again, dont want to add it via converter or the like.p  pAt a conceptual level, Id normally look at something like Rx, but at least at the moment, I dont see how I would use that such that Id still have a pull collection useful for binding as the ItemsSource to some ItemsControl grid, combobox, listbox, whateverp  pCertainly this is a specific case of a more generic problem  how to have live linq query outputs  you might want live collections that are subsets of the source, or a projection, or some combination, or whatever.  Much like we have LINQ providers for IEnumerable, IQueryable, and IObservable, it feels like we couldshould have a provider for something like IObservableCollection where IObservableCollection  ICollection, INotifyCollectionChanged or something similarp  pThat more generic frameworkproviderwhatever seems pretty complicated especially implementing it in a performant way, so at least at the moment, Im just looking for the particular scenario of a source collection in this case, a ObservableCollection, even though the DomainContext only exposes them as IEnumerablep  pAm I thinking about this wrongp
Negative 38948 pIm relatively new to Javascript. I was wondering if it supports components and objects like Python does.

Negative 38948 pI have a problem with WPF applicationpresentation for Tablet PC with multi touch screen. One slide of the presentation consists of Canvas on background and of a small UserControl. This UserControl is invisible at start, but whenever user touches the screen, it becomes visible and if user moves his finger, the control moves accordingly following the finger, like a cursor. Then, when user stops touching the screen, the control becomes invisible again.p  pThis is not very hard to do using the TouchDown, TouchUp and TouchMove event handlers and it works fine if user touches the screen with just one finger. However, when user holds one finger on position X e.g. canvas coordinates [100,100] and another finger on position Y e.g. [500, 100], the UserControl starts jumping between positions X and Y, which doesnt look very well...p  pNow Id like the screen to react only to one touch at the time, which I can do in operating system Windows 7 using Control Panel  Pen and Touch  Touch by unchecking item Enable multitouch gestures and inking.p  pThis works fine, exactly as I want it to, unfortunately its not very convenient, because sometimes I need to use the multitouch and I cant change it every time I decide to use the application...p  pThats why Id like to ask if there is any way how to disable the multitouch programmaticaly, in the application or just in WPF UserControl where I need it.

Negative 38948 pI have a big codeResultSetcode getting from a codeJDBCcode query of few thousand rows. Using each of these rows, I have to instantiate an codeObjectcode, setting fields of it according to the fields of this result set. Now, as we all know, the codegetXXXcode methods of this codeJDBC APIcode return code0code if that particular column was codenullcode. So for each field of each row, I have to do a codewasNullcode before setting the value in my codeobjectcode, which looks pretty ugly and may be is not efficient as well. So, is there any other way by which I can avoid it p  pApart from JDBC, if there is some entirely different, standard, commonly used way, I am open to know about that as well.p  pThanksp  pstrongEDIT 1strongp  precodepatientInput.setRaceCodeIdpatients.getShortracecodeid   ifpatients.wasNull     patientInput.setRaceCodeIdnull codepre  pcodepatientscode is a codeResultSetcode. codepatientInputcode is an codeobjectcode.

If it was, then set that object field as codenullcode, as codegetXXXcode returns code0code in that case.p

Negative 38948 pIm using PackageMaker 3.0.4 to make an install package that includes .kext and .plugin files that need to be installed to system directories. My goal is to create a .pmdoc p  pI just cant believe that anybody is actually using it because I have hit so many bugs that I dont know how anybody has managed to get it working for them. I dont embelieveem Im doing anything particularly unusual, but almost every time I open a .pmdoc to edit or even when building it from the commandline PackageMaker will arbitrarily change my settings. Particularly permissions, but also paths. p  pIt is particularly infuriating from the commandline because were using the .pmdoc when building the installers... so we end up with a broken installer because PackageMaker has gone and messed up the various important permissions  meaning .kext files cannot load and the like.p  pAt this stage the best workaround seems to be writing a postflight script that will modify the permissions on the commandline, and just leave PackageMaker to break the permissions however it wants to. This doesnt address the other changes it makes sometimes even causing the files to be corrupt to the point I cant even open the .pmdoc anymore.p  pSo... has anybody actually managed to successfully integrate PackageMaker as part of their build process Or is it really as fundamentally broken as it seems and everyone else is too wise to even touch itp

Negative 38948 pI am converting an iPhone app to a Universal app. I have a NIB view which I want to use on the iPad as is but resized and positioned. On the iPhone I am initializing normally with initWithNibName...p  precode EventEditViewController eventEditViewController  [[EventEditViewController alloc] initWithNibNameEventEditViewController bundlenil] codepre  pI found that this did not work well for me on the iPad for various reasons. So I created my own initialization method to call instead when running on the iPad...p  precodeEventEditViewController eventEditViewControllerForIPad  [[EventEditViewController alloc] initWithFrameiPadFrame eventDatelongDate eventeventName delegateself] codepre  pThis solved a couple of problems. One how to resize and position the view where I wanted it and how to properly initialize certain variables. I am actually passing more variables than you see here. p  pIt works really well, but I just now noticed that, unlike initWithNibName viewDidLoad fires before my initWithFrame method. I only found this out because a variable I was trying to access in viewDidLoad was showing up as a zombie and I thought I was initializing it in my initWithFrame method.p  pI was surprised by this behavior. Is it normal It doesnt make sense to me that the view would be loaded before the named initMethod in the allocinit call.p  pI am now wondering if what I am doing might not be a good thing. Like I said it works really well, but should I not use my own initialization method herep  pIf its ok to do it this way, maybe someone can explain why the view loads before the init method.p  pThanks,p  pJohnp

This caches the images during the splash screen, but then displays the animation.p  pThere are two alternatives that I would like to consider.p  pThis first is to forcibly cache the images upon initialization during the splash screen, strongwithoutstrong the animation playing upon loading the view. read custom UIImageView prepareToPlay method  strongThis solution would be ideal.strong p  pThe second alternative would be to keep my current code, running the animation at startup once the view has been loaded, but disabling the invoking button until this first animation completes. Since UIImageView doesnt have its own completion notification, would the best solution be to set up a timer equal to the animation duration and enable the button and the end of said timerp  pThanks in advance, Gregp  pstrongTLDR  How to forcibly cache animation images upon initialization.strongp

Negative 38948 pI have a WCF service using basicHttpBinding.  On a service method I have a class that is returned, for this class I need to dynamically  programmatically exclude properties and change property names for the XML.  This needs to be done both in the WSDL and when the service method is called.p  pI have searched for the best solution and it seems that I will need to 1 use the XmlAttributeOverrides with the XmlSerializer or 2 implement the IXmlSerializable on the class that needs to be customized.  Or there may be a better solution altogether.  I know that Property Name  Specified can be added to the class and then those properties can be excluded.  However, this does not exclude in the WSDL and this doesnt solve the property renaming issue.p  pWhy do I want this  Because of globalization and customization of our application.  There are many properties that are built into our application that may be renamed or hidden entirely from users of the application.p  pAfter MUCH research I the best option is to swap out the WCF serializer with my own custom serializer.  However, I never found good examples of how to do this for a custom class that would use the XmlSerializer.  Also Im not sure how I would pass in the XmlAttributeOverrides for a specific class.p  pAlso, this might not be the case for others who want this same functionality but in my application I only need to initialize the values once for the lifetime of the app.  Too bad C doesnt allow static readonly variables to be used with attributes.p  pHere is an simple example of a classp  precodepublic Customer    public string Address1        get     set       public string Address2        get     set       public string Zipcode        get     set     codepre  pIn this example I would like to for certain installations of the application use PostalCode instead of Zipcode and hide the Address2 property.p  pYour help is very much appreciated.p  pThanks, Tylerp

Negative 38948 pI have a bit of a difficult situation in that I need a way for a client connected to an ASP.NET MVC site to sign and decrypt blobs with their private key, such that the server never sees the private key material. In the decryption case, these are encrypted session keys. It is acceptable that the server see the session key, just not the users private key.p  pThat is, I need to present the user some content in a browser, have some javascript or java applets, or silverlight, etc. execute client side that communicates with a hardware token on the client, and returns the result to the server. p  pThis is NOT client side authentication. I dont need to simply authenticate via IIS with a certificate. The hardware tokens are HID OmniKey USB readers. p  pMy understanding of the options available arep  pstrong1. a hrefhttpsdeveloper.mozilla.orgenJavaScriptcrypto relnofollowMozilla Javascript Cryptoastrong  This seems to be the optimal route. It appears that Firefox exposes various smart card events and functionality to remote sites. I see how to sign text, but nothing about decrypting blobs the largest goal. There seems to be methods for loading a PKCS11 module, but the documentation seems to stop after that. p  pstrong2. Silverlight with Elevated Truststrong  This is my second preferable route, because of familiarity with Silverlight and .NET. Silverlight 5 has the ability to PInvoke, so I could always call the PCSC modules, but this requires running Out of Browser, which I cant do. There seems to be some posts about running a Silverlight app In Browser with elevated trust, but this is a global setting, and so I dont want to diminish security for other applications.p  pstrong3. ActiveXstrong   An ActiveX component can interact with the PCSC module, but this would be an Internet Explorer only solution. If forced to pick a required browser, Id prefer Firefox or Chrome. p  pstrong3. FirefoxChrome Extensionstrong  My understanding is Firefox XPCOM is C, and I can just directly call the PCSC libraries, and the extension can interact with scriptsDOM on the remote site. Im not sure how the remote site though can trigger a Firefox extension. In other words, how does the remote site tell the extension ok, its time to sign One such example of this route is a hrefhttpwww.lizardlabs.netxsignxenc.aspx relnofollowXSigna though it doesnt use hardware tokens. p  pstrong4. Java Appletstrong  This might ultimately be the only way to do it. Ive found a couple examplesguides, but Im not familiar with Java. a hrefhttpwww.developer.comjavaotherarticle.php3587361JavaAppletforSigningwithaSmartCard.htm relnofollowJava Applet for Signing with a Smart Carda. In this case, its just a simple applet that can communicate with the token, and post the results to the site. p  pAre there other options available I believe option 1, Mozilla Javascript Crypto is the best approach, but the documentation is beyond sparse. Thanks for any guidance. p

Negative 38948 pIm trying to make a button which glows when the mouse is pointed over it. There has to be a timer in the background to control a smooth fading inandout of these colors. It doesnt jump from one color to the next, it gradually fades to the next color.p  pNow my problem is that when it fades back to its regular color, it doesnt lock into its final color. In fact, it keeps jumping from light to dark.p  pThis is a custom button of mine, which Im not going to post the code of, but this code can be placed onto anything with a mouse enterexit event and a color property.p  pIt works by setting a variable codeFMenuDestColorcode. codeExtractColorcode gets RGB values based on a color. The timer compares each RGB channel between the current color and the destination color. Then the timer modifies the current color to fade to the next. These calculations are done in a function called codeCalcColorFadecode  run 3 times for each channel.p  precodeprocedure ExtractColorconst Color TColor var R, G, B Byte begin   R GetRValueColor   G GetGValueColor   B GetBValueColor end  function CalcColorFadeconst C1, C2 Byte Byte const   RGBMULT  1.2   RGBSENS  5 begin   if C1 ltgt C2 then begin         if C1 gt C2  RGBSENS and C1 lt C2  RGBSENS then       Result C2     else       if C1 gt C2 then         Result EnsureRangeTruncC1  RGBMULT, 0, 255       else         Result EnsureRangeTruncC1  RGBMULT, 0, 255   end else begin     Result C2   end end  procedure TfrmMain.tmrMenuGlowTimerSender TObject var   R1, G1, B1 Byte   R2, G2, B2 Byte   R3, G3, B3 Byte begin   if MenuButton.Color ltgt FMenuDestColor then begin     ExtractColorMenuButton.Color, R1, G1, B1     ExtractColorFMenuDestColor, R2, G2, B2     R3 CalcColorFadeR1, R2     G3 CalcColorFadeG1, G2     B3 CalcColorFadeB1, B2     MenuButton.Color RGBR3, G3, B3   end end  procedure TfrmMain.MenuButtonMouseEnterSender TObject begin   FMenuDestColor clBlue end  procedure TfrmMain.MenuButtonMouseLeaveSender TObject begin   FMenuDestColor clNavy end codepre  pPoint the mouse over it, and it will fade to the next color.

Im trying to generate a list of online users to give it a more practical applicationlike feel, but the problem with that, is I have no clue how to do it easily.p  pWhen users login to my site, a session named codegusernamecode is created, the chat says username, but Ill fix that and from what I see so far, the easiest method would be to store their username in a database called OnlineUsers and call that data via Ajax, but, the other problem, is that its session based, and sometimes the users can just leave, without logging out, and I intended to run a script to logout the user from both the OnlineUsers table, and by deleting the session.p  pIf they leave without logging out, theyd be online forever I could potentially suffix a bit of code on every page, that toggled an ajax event on page close, the event being a script that kills their OnlineUsers table record, but then again, that would load the server with useless queries as users jump between pages, as far as Im aware.p  pCreating my entire site in Ajax isnt really an option, as its a load of different sites combined in to 1 place with a social layer if you will from a social service.p  pDoes anyone see a way to do this that would make sense, and be easy to integrate, and do with Apache, without command line accessp

Negative 38948 pThis has been bugging me for a few days now.  Im trying to migrate my utility, LScreamer, to Windows 7, yet it doesnt seem to be cooperating.p  pThis utility transmits a Atmega firmware file to the bootloader running in the atmega.  In Linux when I run this utility, it is able to send the entire file with only a handful of retransmits necessary.  In Windows, almost every other transmit is a retransmit, and most of the times it results in the processor not getting the complete firmware.p  pMy understanding of python and pyserial is that they should be portable between OSs.  But since I am pretty inexperienced in using Python, perhaps Im doing something strange.  p  pIs there any observable errors in the LScreamer utility attached below  Thanks for your helpp  precode usrbinenv python  This program is a port of Screamer V2.0 produced on Sparkfun.com which is     useful for wirelessly downloading code to an arduino.     The problem with the original code was that it was written for Windows,     whereas there may be many Linux users that would like to use the program.     Currently this port only supports ATmega168 and ATmega1280, but it has     been written to easily add more processors. Questions and contributions     can be submitted back to the developer at dustin.roboticsgmail.com      This has been updated to work on Windows as well, but it will still be      called LScreamer.

Negative 38948 pOk, I have been thinking of developing a web application using the play framework as my backend service and sencha for my front end stuff.p  pNow I have been also looking into sencha touch and phonegap, which can help me make a native android application. So the problem here is how do i render data to two different devices. One is a touch device and other opens in a proper desktop browser. p  pShould I detect from which device the request has been made and then load the appropriate controller or what  I am really confused right now  I am very new to the web  and mobile application scene, so please if someone can explain to me how to proceed would be a great help  Thank you.p

Negative 38948 pI have a codeVectorcode class which represents a 2D vector. It is templated to allow any numerical type to be used for the emxem and emyem components. As an example, one of the arithmetic operators I overload is codecode for multiplying a vector with a scalarp  precodetemplate lttypename T, typename Ugt inline const VectorltTgt operatorconst VectorltTgtamp vector, U scalar      return VectorltTgtvector.x  scalar, vector.y  scalar  codepre  pemI also have a function with the parameters in the opposite order to allow codescalar  Vectorcode in addition to codeVector  scalarcode.emp  pAs you can see, I use codeltT, Ugtcode instead of simply codeltTgtcode so that the scalar doesnt have to be the same type as the Vector. When I emdidntem do this, surprisingly codeVectorltdoublegt  intcode wouldnt compile I thought the int would automatically widen.p  pIn any case, I dont simply want to return a codeVectorltTgtcode. I want to mimic the builtin types and return whichever has higher precision, codeTcode or codeUcode. So for example, codeVectorltintgt  double gt Vectorltdoublegtcode while codeVectorltdoublegt  short gt Vectorltdoublegtcode.p  pIs this possiblep

This makes it impossible to program a game.p  pFor example, I have a PHP file that just sets up the client like this client.phpp  precodetry      client  new soapClienthttplocalhost8000BlackJackServicewsdl,         array             trace gt 1,             exceptions gt 0,             cachewsdl gt 0            catch Exception e      print Caught exception  . egtgetMessage . n   codepre  pThen in my main file ill be using jQuery and ajax calls to load it dynamically but now im just testing I have the following code blackJackClient.phpp  precoderequireonceclient.php ini  inisetsoap.wsdlcacheenabled,0 BetAmountPost  100     printrresult  clientgtbuttonDealClickarrayBetAmount gt stringBetAmountPostgtbuttonDealClickResult     printrresult  clientgtPlayerMoneygtPlayerMoneyResult codepre  pThe first call will start a new game Deal and the player his bet amount for example 100 gets subtracted from the total amount 1000. So what do I get returned in result is money  900.p  pThe following commando will ask what money I currently have, and one expects to get returned 900, but no instead I have 1000 my starting amount.p  pSo my question is how can I make it that all calls are made in 1 session so we still use the same connectionp  pThanksp

Negative 38948 pI am not sure if this can be done, but it would be great if the user can use the excel spreadsheet while the macro is running at the backend. Is there any way this can be done Thanks.p  pEDIT The user is repeatedly 105 times generating Random permutations on n items n  100 through a macro. This might take around 1015 mins or more to get done. So, if the user can open the excel workbook to do other tasks, while the macro is running , it would be nice. It would typically be a different workbook from the one in which macro is running.

Now I know this might be a possible duplicate of questions to which I referred earlier but I need a better explanation on this.p  pOnly thing I could come up with is that since templates are invoked at runtime,and codesizeofcode is a compile time operator, compiler just ignores the linep  precode   int sz  sizeofarrsizeofarr[0] codepre  psince it does not know the exact type of arr until it actually invokes the function. Is it correct or am I missing something over here Also is it reliable to send pointer to an array to the function templates p

Negative 38948 pI have asked a few questions about this recently and I am getting where I need to go, but have perhaps not been specific enough in my last questions to get all the way there. So, I am trying to put together a structure for calculating some metrics based on app data, which should be flexible to allow additional metrics to be added easily and securely, and also relatively simple to use in my views.p  pThe overall goal is that I will be able to have a custom helper that allows something like the following in my viewp  precodecalculatemetricmetrics.wherename gt profit,customer,startdate,enddate codepre  pThis should be fairly self explanatory  the name can be substituted to any of the available metric names, and the calculation can be performed for any customer or group of customers, for any given time period.p  pWhere the complexity arises is in how to store the formula for calculating the metric  I have shown below the current structure that I have put together for doing thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comZKsZ7.png altenter image description herep  pYou will note that the key models are metric, operation, operationtype and operand. This kind of structure works ok when the formula is very simple, like profit  one would only have two operands, codecustomer.sales.sellingprice.sumcode and codecustomer.sales.costprice.sumcode, with one operation of type subtraction. Since we dont need to store any intermediate values, coderegistertargetcode will be code1code, as will codereturnregistercode.p  pI dont think I need to write out a full example to show where it becomes more complicated, but suffice to say if I wanted to calculate the percentage of customers with email addresses for customers who opened accounts between two dates but did not necessarily buy, this would become much more complex since the helper function would need to know how to handle the date variations.p  pAs such, it seems like this structure is overly complicated, and would be hard to use for anything other than a simple formula  can anyone suggest a better way of approaching this problemp  pEDIT On the basis of the answer from Railsdog, I have made some slight changes to my model, and reuploaded the diagram for clarity. Essentially, I have ensured that the reportingcategory model can be used to hide intermediate operands from users, and that operands that may be used in user calculations can be presented in a categorised format. All I need now is for someone to assist me in modifying my structure to allow an operation to use emeitherem an actual operand or the result of a previous operation in a railsesqe way.p  pThanks for all of your help so farp

Negative 38948 pI would like to create a new winRT metro application. It is essential however that I can handle input from a barcode scanner in this application.  Ive searched here and there, but until now havent found any guidance on doing such a thing. Or if this is even possible in a metro style application. So  Is it possible  Maybe an example on how this can be donep  pNote for the moment it would be OK if I have a solution for USB barcode scanners only. Others serial, bluetooth are nice but not essential...p

Negative 38948 pI have a many to many relationship between two existing tables strongUser UserId, Namestrong and strongLocation LocationId, Namestrong, these cant be changed.  I have used an manytomany mapping, but we have a new requirement to include historyfuture movements.p  pI have used the peoplesoft concept of effectively dating the records in a new intersect table strongUserLocation UserId, LocationId, EffectiveDate, Statusstrong that replaces the old table, where the first 3 fields make up the primary key.p  pIn SQL I can simply use the following statement to return the active record for the given effective date, but I cant get anything like this from NHibernate even get an error about parameters not working in multilevel select.  p  precodeselect l.   from location l   where l.locationId in     select ul.locationId      from UserLocation ul      where ul.EffectiveDate          select maxuled.EffectiveDate         from UserLocation uled         where ul.LocationId  uled.LocationId           and ul.EffectiveDate  uled.EffectiveDate           and ul.UserId  uled.UserId           and ul.Status  true   codepre  pI need to return back further filtered records by including parameters for UserId and EffectiveDate columns but would be happy to return everything to start with.p  pMy issue however is the mapping classes I use code mapping, not fluent and cant even get it close to working limited NHibernate knowledge.  I was hoping not to have to create a new class for the intersect table.  I havent even got to the insertupdatedelete part yet as I cant even get select to work.p  pRequirements  1. Insert new record in UserLocation when associating a user to a location with EffectiveDate  NOW, Status  True  3. Moving a user to a new location should insert new record in UserLocation with EffectiveDate  NOW, Status  True  4. Removing user from the location will insert new UserLocation record with EffectiveDate  NOW, Status  False  5. Retrieve the Locations the user is associated to on a given date.p  pNote As reports are generated on this data we cannot delete the records, and data is also created for future events.p  pIf someone could point me in the right direction to get started that would be appreciated.  I have looked at Loader and Interceptor classes but cant seem to make it fit.p

Negative 38948 pI have been using afreechart to draw a few charts in my app, but I bumped into something I have not been able to work out by myself, so I hope someone here can give me a pointer in the right direction. I use the DemoView, which is included in the samples, and I pass the chart to the View. This has worked perfectly when my view was made up of a LinearLayout only, and the chart was added to this layout. However, if my view is a ScrollView, and to this ScrollView I add the same LinearLayout built programmatically in exactly the same way, the chart does not show up. However, the rest of the layout looks the same. Any idea Is there anything I should be setting in my chart in order for it to show up in a scrollviewp  pThanksp

The viewController named bookShelf is popped but the rootViewControllers view does not change , it is still the bookShelf.view.p  pthe code is like this.p  precode voidtest      [self.navigationController pushViewControllerbookShelf animatedYES]     [self.navigationController popViewControllerAnimatedYES]  codepre  pthe bookShelf is popped , but the view does not change. 1when I set the animatedNO , it will be right 2when I pop bookShelf afterDealy 1s , it will be right too.p  pI think the problem is caused by the animation , when the pushs animation does not stop , I popViewController , it will be wrong.p  pDoes anyone have a better way to solve it  thank you.p

Negative 38948 pAt the outset, let me confess that I am a newbie to Groovy Script but have prior scripting experience in other languages.p  pI am trying to calculate a sum of field values entered by users in a web form based on an Oracle Table. This Table has approx 5 sections with about 5 questions in each section. Each question has a drop down list like Yes, No amp NA. All the questions read Table Columns in each section are named like SEC1Q1, SEC1Q2,.... SEC2Q1,SEC2Q2,.... etc.p  pDepending upon the value Yes, No, NA a user picks a score 1,2,0 is assigned to the corresponding question. Each section has its own total  which becomes a subtotal for the entire table, so there will be 5 subtotals and a Grand Total  which is a sum of all the section totals. All the subtotals and the Grand total are visible to the users and are updated OnItemChange for any question.p  pThis is how I visualize creating a script for thisp  pFirst go thru the Column Names matching an expression and create an array or some kind of list and get the user provided Values , sum them up and update the subtotals and the grand total so a user can see them.p  pThis will avoid hard coding the Column Names and will also provide future room for includingexcluding  questions from the current sections.p  pI have looked hard and searched on the web, but havent come across any ideas for Groovy Scripting. p  pI am sure there are many other great options to achieve this thru Java and other languages, but my choice right now is limited to Groovy.p  pI was wondering if anyall good souls out there can point me to the right directions. Any cooked, halfcooked Groovy script examples will be greatly appreciated.p

When this button is clicked, app moves from the selection view to the next view  this was implemented via storyboard.

Interestingly, the frame values are not what I set, as in code shown here, I have x50, y300, w200, h60, while NSLog description gives out x190, y345, w110, h94, which is around the position I saw in run time.

In another word, the line of setting frame does work SOME WAY, but not the way I wanted. It just takes storyboard values, but not those I set by x,y,w,h.p

Negative 38948 pId like to be able to write tests or specs that state that user codesoandsocode can read or edit file codesuchandsuchcode.  Although I would ultimately like this to be in RSpec, Im assuming it will either all boil down to Bash commands neatly wrapped in Ruby methods, of course, since it doesnt seem to be available in Rubys File class, or anything else Ive looked at. Ive been hunting around for something in Bash to do this, and cant find anything and nothing in the File class looks useful either.  Note File.owned does emnotem do what I want, as it only tests if the process running the Ruby code is the owner, not if any arbitrary user has rights to edit or read, so its significantly different on two counts.p  pIs there any way to do this, built into Bash  Or Ruby, or some Ruby gem, that I missed Or do I need to build a system myself, by getting owner and group info for the file, as well as read, write, and execute bits for each, and then looking up members of the group in case codesoandsocode is not the owner, and seeing if the desired permissions are available to codesoandsocode either through ownership or group membershipp  pIm currently only concerned about doing this on Unixlike systems, although something not dependent on a Unix shell that would also run on Windows would be a nice bonus.p  pAlso, Im interested in testing emactualem files, so something like FakeFS is not as far as I can see useful to me.  Im not trying to test how my Ruby code will interact with a file system, Im trying to verify that all the necessary operations can be performed on actual files and directories.  Again, I want to be able to specify that codesoandsocode can edit or read file codesuchandsuchcode, strongemNOTemstrong specify that file codesuchandsuchcode is owned by codesoandsocode.

Negative 38948 pIm using an SVG font in Chrome.p  pFrom time to time, the glyphs seem to end up with a width of zero. This means if I have the character all by itself, its parent container gets a width of zero, so it is basically not shown. If its parent has other things, itll appear behind the font.p  pSo, if I have  with the custom font, it winds up invisible because it seems the glyph has a width of zero.p  pIf I have something like p Cookiep, I see Cookie, and the  is the custom font and is behind the word Cookie.p  pIm not sure if it is a Chromespecific issue, a .svg font specific issue or what. And the weird thing is it only happens sometimes. Occasionally it will start with a refresh, then persist through several refreshes. Eventually itll go away generally when the cache is cleared.p  pIt doesnt seem to be a corrupt file download either, since comparing the content length of the response that works and when it doesnt is the same... though Im not prepared to rule anything out.p  pThanks.p

Negative 38948 pI am trying to get a list of templates that are already in the codeTemplateCachecode which is private and hidden behind the Configuration.p  pI am trying to write a small admin UI to the templates and display what is already cached and call codeconfiguration.removeTemplateFromCacheStringcode on a specific template and not everything codeclearTemplateCachecode will clear too much and cause too much file IO.  My alternative is to keep a parallel list of template names in a Set and use that as a list of keys, but would be nice if codeFreeMarkercode provided this for consistency.p  pAlso, it there a reason for hiding the codeTemplateCachecode contents behind Configuration while allowing removal by key via public method, but not a list of keys.

Negative 38948 pI have VS2010 and VS2012 installed on my computer and had the .NET Framework 4.0 which I then upgraded to .NET Framework 4.5.  However, I am still developing apps that need to work on .NET Framework 4.0.  The project says that it is targeting .NET Framework 4 Client Profile the assemblies even point to .NET Framework 4.0 folder under Referenced Assemblies.  The problem comes when I move this application to a machine that only has 4.0 it wont start and come up with errors the immediate problem being an exception resulting from codeWindowStateBinding WindowStatecode which you cant do in 4.0 but you can in 4.5.  I need this to throw the exception  on my development box, why doesnt it My assumption is that despite my best efforts is that it uses the 4.5 dlls if they exist.  How can I make it really use 4.0 without uninstall 4.5p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pTo repro this install .NET Framework 4.5 and create a WPF project targeting .NET Framework 4.0.  Bind the WindowState to a property in a VM or code behind make this property have a public get and private set.  .NET Framework 4.5 handles this just fine even when ModeTwoWay must ignore the set .NET Framework 4 doesnt and throws an exception A TwoWay or OneWayToSource binding cannot work on the readonly property State of type....  On the box with .NET Framework 4.5 works like a charm try it on a machine with only .NET Framework 4.0 and it blows up...  So any ideas on how to really target 4.0 when 4.5 is installedp  pBug report to MS here a hrefhttpsconnect.microsoft.comVisualStudiofeedbackdetails774694targetingnetframework40when45doesntseemtoworkhttpsconnect.microsoft.comVisualStudiofeedbackdetails774694targetingnetframework40when45doesntseemtoworkap

Negative 38948 pI have a codedata.tablecode codeDTcode and I want to run codemodel.matrixcode on it.  Each row has a string ID, which is stored in the codeIDcode column of codeDTcode.  When I run codemodel.matrixcode on codeDTcode, my formula excludes the codeIDcode column.  The problem is, codemodel.matrixcode drops some rows because of NAs.  If I set the rownames of codeDTcode to the codeIDcode column, before calling codemodel.matrixcode, then the final model matrix has rownames, and Im all set.  Otherwise, I cant figure out what rows I end up with.  Im setting the rownames with coderownamesDT  DTIDcode.

Negative 38948 pI am working on a server side physics experiment where the user controls an object through a socket. The problem I am running into results when the user moves the object outside the boundaries of the world.p  pI am using Box2Djs as installed through codenpmcode.p  pI create world 500x500 and then attach the following listener to itp  precodevar boundaryListener  new b2d.b2BoundaryListener boundaryListener.Violation  function body      we will move this body to the opposite side     var position  body.GetWorldCenter     snap to opposite side     if position.x lt 0          position.x  worldAABB.upperBound.x  position.x          if position.y lt 0          position.y  worldAABB.upperBound.y  position.y          if position.x gt worldAABB.upperBound.x          position.x  worldAABB.upperBound.x          if position.y gt worldAABB.upperBound.y          position.y  worldAABB.upperBound.y           body.mflags  body.mflags amp b2d.b2Body.efrozenFlag does nothing   this.world.SetBoundaryListenerboundaryListener codepre  pcodeworldAABBcode is the b2AABB that the world uses as a boundary.p  pThe problem is that I have noticed that when the boundary listener is fired, the flags are set to 22 which is allowSleep, frozen, and island flags. It would seem that when a b2Body passes outside the world boundary, it is frozen. That last line is an attempt to unfreeze the body by messing with the internal flags, but I have a distinct feeling thats the wrong way to do it.p  pHow can I unfreeze the body There are no functions that clear the frozen flags that I can see the javascript is over 10,000 lines long so I honestly havent read the whole thing and placing some bodies as walls seems to have no effect the users object passes right through them.p  pMy walls are created like sop  precodecreate walls var wallShape  new b2d.b2PolygonDef wallShape.SetAsBox500, 10 wallShape.density  0.0 wallShape.friction  0.3  var bodyDef  new b2d.b2BodyDef bodyDef.position.Set250, 20 var north  this.world.CreateBodybodyDef north.CreateShapewallShape  bodyDef  new b2d.b2BodyDef bodyDef.position.Set250, 499 var south  this.world.CreateBodybodyDef south.CreateShapewallShape  bodyDef  new b2d.b2BodyDef bodyDef.position.Set499,250 bodyDef.angle  Math.PI  2 var east  this.world.CreateBodybodyDef east.CreateShapewallShape  bodyDef  new b2d.b2BodyDef bodyDef.position.Set1, 250 bodyDef.angle  Math.PI  2 var west  this.world.CreateBodybodyDef west.CreateShapewallShape codepre  pDoes anyone have any insights on how to fix this There is very very little documentation I can find on using Box2D in javascript aside from the flash documentation that the website points to which doesnt match half the time and the C documentation which doesnt even talk about freezing.p  pIt would probably be helpful to mention that the world has no gravity and all the objects have some linear and angular damping its supposed to be a psuedoinspace feel.p

Negative 38948 pI know this has been asked many times but I want to be specific. I use to use selenium. After googling it looks like I can run it via console and it gives me a bunch of text output but I rather not parse that and I want a passfail type of thingp  pEvery once in a while I like to run all of my unit test on the UI not code. I dont want to submit a form with certain values, I want to see if I click this img does the dropbox beside it pop out and if i select a name will it be in the form which Ill then submit after running a few other things.p  pThe reason Id like this is certain features MUST ALWAYS be working so im ok with adjusting the unit test everytime I modify the UI for those feature. For the rest the unit test in code which checks business logic will be enough as those UIs are always changing or not very important.p  pIt be nice if something can kickoff firefox and chrome or webkit but thats not required.p  pLike I said Id like passfail, some kind of easy text to parse. Complex test is ok as I know regex but I dont want to figure out when one unit test ends or starts. p

Negative 38948 pIn rails 3, I have several polymorphic models such as codeImagecode and codeCommentcode, so my question is,p  pWhen someone makes a request to CreateUpdateDestroy a polymorphic object, should the request go to a single controller for the polymorphic object codeCommentControllercode, or should the request be routed to the controller of the polymorphic accessor i.e. codeStatusControllercode or codeImageControllercodep  pThe pros of a single controller are that it is more DRY and probably more RESTful, the bad thing is that it feels to me like it couples the application more, where many things are tied together by one single controller.

Negative 38948 pIm trying to use the NSUserDefaults class to hold a bunch of text label info. Specifically, I have a view with a button and a label. When the button is clicked, it takes the user to another view using the modal connection. In this second view, the user uses a slider to set a value. A single button shifts back to the first view upon clicking, also using the modal connection. I want to insert a piece of code so that when the user uses the slider on the second view and clicks the button, it updates the text label on the first view to the value of the slider.p  pThis is the code I put under the button method in the second viewp  precodeNSUserDefaults defaults  [NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] [defaults setObjectmyValue forKeymyKey] [defaults synchronize] textLabelOnFirstView.text  [defaults stringForKeymyKey] codepre  pAlso, for the same view controller under the viewDidLoad method, I put the following codep  precodeNSUserDefaults defaults  [NsUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] textLabelOnFirstView.text  [defaults stringsForKeymyKey] codepre  pHowever, this is what happens After I open the first view, I click the button to get to the second view. In the second view I slide the slider to 100, and then click the button. The button takes me back to the first view, but the label never updated, and does not say 100. If I close the app and reopen, the label is still wrong. However If I click the button to go to second view, and then click the second views button to get back to the first view even without adjusting the slider, I now see the value of 100 in the text label.p  pCan anyone please suggest how to change my code so that the first views text label is updated with the sliders value as soon as the user transitions from the second view back to the first Thanksp

Negative 38948 pIn my app I am trying to make it possible to calculate the distance a person walks. To do this I have created a LocationHelper class that should get me the current GeoPoint every 30 seconds or 10 meters. I already have a method that returns the distance in meters between two GeoPoints that I know works, because I have used it in a previous project. I also have an Activity called WalkActivity where I call the method getDistance in LocationHelper and display it in a TextView that is updated every 30 seconds with help of a timer.

codepre  pIve looked over StackOverFlow and other sources as to the cause of this error.  But no luck.  The error occurs when saving SQLGraphObject.  Apparently it thinks Im trying to assign a SQLGraphObject object to a Set property when saving.p  pInterestingly enough, SQLGraph which extends from the same super class, saves with no issue.  p  pIm assuming there is something about SQLGraphObject that is causing it to error out, but I can not see what is different between it and SQLGraph.p  pUpdate  When removing the set mappings in SQLGraphObject I get the same error with string an primitive fields.  When removing all the field mappings, I then get the same error regarding the id and searchable fields in the superclass AbstractGraphPropertyContainer.java.  Saving SQLGraph does not give me any issues.p

exactly what I expected I thought that having replaced all the ComboBoxarrowButtonPainter with the custom coderedPaintercode, I would not see the little triangular black or white arrow but just a red

How can I do that, both in the combo and in the selection popup menup  p[EDIT]p  pFurther investigations I tried to put the properties using codeUIManager.getLookAndFeelDefaults.putcode instead of codeboxDefaults.putcode, and I got the expected result for the arrowButton, which appears as a red square for both classic and pimped combo, obviously. So, I guess what Im doing wrong is to override the properties for the pimped combo, i.e. thos two lines that I got from a hrefhttpwww.jasperpotts.comblog200808skinningasliderwithnimbus relnofollowJasper Potts blogap  precodepimpedCombo.putClientPropertyNimbus.Overrides, boxDefaults pimpedCombo.putClientPropertyNimbus.Overrides.InheritDefaults, false codepre  pCan anyone helps on thatp  p[EDIT 2]p  pI also note inconsistent behaviour if I use codeUIManager.putcode instead of codeUIManager.getLookAndFeelDefaults.putcode, where the arrowButton will appear red for example only on mouseOver, or cliked, etc. Javadoc says codeUIManger.putcode only affects the developers defaults, not the LampF defaults. Whats the difference Any help, link to good documentation on how everything works would be helpful.p

Negative 38948 pIm very new to using Roo, Hibernate, and Postgres. Ive been working on Java, JDBC and MySQL so far but Ive had to change to the former platform recently. p  pI tried to create a basic CRUD web app based on Spring Web MVC using Roo and an existing Postgres database. The reading, displaying, updating and deleting functions all work fine but not the createinsertion function. I really dont know whats going wrong because its a very basic app and the other functions are working fine. Ive tried googling and searching but I didnt find anything that helped with my problem.

So instead of three columns I would have fourp  precode    id             photographerid        photoid      liked [PK] serial        integer                integer       timestamp with time zone     1                  3                    6           20130710 233019.55946300     2                  3                    7           20130711 170053.3961400     3                  3                    8           20130711 172528.495300 codepre  pIs it possible to add this extra column even though it is not in the models I want it so that every time a picture is liked, the time at which it is liked is recorded.

Negative 38948 pI am trying to write some code that will extract the amplitude data from an mp3 as a function of time. I wrote up a rough version on MATLAB a while back using this function a hrefhttplabrosa.ee.columbia.edumatlabmp3read.html relnofollowhttplabrosa.ee.columbia.edumatlabmp3read.htmla However I am having trouble finding a Python equivalent. p  pIve done a lot of research, and so far Ive gathered that I need to use something like mpg321 to convert the .mp3 into a .wav. I havent been able to figure out how to get that to work.p  pThe next step will be reading the data from the .wav file, which I also havent had any success with. Has anyone done anything similar or could recommend some libraries to help with this Thanksp

Negative 38948 pI have a regular empty DIV with overflowyscroll I update that div with content via something like elem.htmlnewcontentp  pNow this is where I get lost. I need to get the height of the entire DIV with new content. Normally itd be done through ScrollTop setting but the problem is that the elem[0].scrollHeight is zerop  pHow do I solve this issuep  pUPDATE I solved the issue. Turns out that my call was in the callback function of the JQuery UI effect. The call back function was supposed to bring the DIV to be visible. Somehow even though its a callback function the DIV was still not visible. So, I had to setTimeout to like 10 mS and then it workedp

However, this also gives me a gutter on the edges of the container, which is not what I want.p  pTo get around this, I have created two containers within each other, where the inner container gets a negative margin equal to the padding of the cells. This actually works well in modern browsers, but it fails in IE 9 and older. I dont care much for IE 7 and backwards, but IE 8  9 still have too big a market share to ignore.p  pSo my question is Why does IE 8  9 not give me a negative horizontal margin in the following fiddle Note that it actually emdoesem give a vertical negative margin  it just doesnt do the same horizontally. And of course, what can I do to fix thisp  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netPd4vd1 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netPd4vd1ap

Negative 38948 pI want to implement a really really fast a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiSobeloperatorSobel operatora for a raytracer a friend of me and I wrote sources can be found a hrefhttpsourceforge.netprojectsthedreammachineherea. What follows is what I figure out so far...p  pFirst, let assume the image is a greyscale picture store line by line in an 8 bits unsigned integers array.p  pTo write a real Sobel filter, I need to compute Gx and Gy for each pixel. Each of these numbers are computed thanks to 6 pixels next to the origin. But SIMD instruction allow me to deal with 16 or even 32 AVX pixels. Hopefully, the kernel of the operator has some nice property, so that I can compute Gy by p  ul lisubtracting each i and i2 rows and store the result in a i1 row of some other picture arrayli liadding the i, twice of the i1 and the i2 columns give the i1 column of the final pictureli ul  pI would do the same but transposed to compute Gx then add the two pictures.p  pSome notes  p  ul liI dont care about memory allocation since everything will be allocated at the beginning.li liI can deal with the overflow and sign problem dividing the values by four thanks to mmsrliepi8 codeuint8t  2  uint8t  2  int7t really store as int8tbr  int7t  uint8t ltlt 1  2  int7t  uint8t br some precision is lost but I dont carecodeli ul  pThe real problem Im facing is to go from the rows to the columns. Since I couldnt load the picture in the SIMD register otherwise. I must flip the image three time at least isnt it p  pOnce the original picture. Then I can compute the first step for Gx and Gy and then flip the resulting pictures to compute the second step.p  pSo, here is my questions p  ul liIs this kind of implementation a good idea li liIs there a way to transpose an array faster than the dumb algorithm  I dont think soli liWhere will be the bottlenecks  any guess  P li ul

Negative 38948 pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pI have a codeRichTextBoxcode control I am using essentially like a console in my WinForms application.  Currently my applicationwide logger posts messages using delegates and one of the listeners is this RTB. The logger synchronously sends lots of short less than 100 char strings denoting event calls, status messages, operation results, etc.p  pPosting lots of these short messages to the RTB using BeginInvoke provides UI responsiveness until heavy parallel processing starts logging lots of messages and then the UI starts posting items out of order, or the text is far behind hundreds of milliseconds. I know this because when the processing slows down or is stopped, the console keeps writing for some time afterwords.p  pMy temporary solution was to invoke the UI synchronously and add a blocking collection buffer. Basically taking the many small items from the Logger and combining them in a stringbuilder to be posted in aggregate to the RTB. The buffer posts items as they come if the UI can keep up, but if the queue gets too high, then it aggregates them and then posts to the UI. The RTB is thus updated piecemeal and looks jumpy when lots of things are being logged.p  pstrongQuestionstrongp  pHow can I run a codeRichTextBoxcode control on its own UI thread to keep other buttons on the same codeFormcode responsive during frequent but small append operations From research, I think I need to run an STA thread and call codeApplication.Runcode on it to put the RTB on its own thread, but the examples I found lacked substantive code samples and there dont seem to be any tutorials perhaps because what I want to do is ill advised. Also I wasnt sure if there where any pitfalls for a single Control being on its own thread relative to the rest of the Form. ie. Any issues closing the main form or will the STA thread for the RTB just die with the form closing Any special disposing etc.p  pThis should demonstrate the issue once you add 3 codeButtoncodes and a codeRichTextBoxcode to the form. What I essentially want to accomplish is factoring away the BufferedConsumer by having the RTB on its own thread.

Negative 38948 pHere is my sad storyp  pToday I made the mistake of pulling from a different Repository into mine. I am working on Repository A and I pulled the contents of Repository B into A. I did it because I wanted some files from that Repository. p  pAfter that I pushed my repository to remote. p  pMy problem is not my code because both repositories are different. But the problem is the history.p  pNow my remote Repository which can be seen by the public has all the history of commits from Repository B mixed with my commits in the log. p  pHow can I remove those commits from the history LOG p  pIs there a way to kinda reset my repository to its state like yesterday  Would that cause the commits from Repository B in my history to disappear p  pI tried to reset the Merge, Use Rebase and Cherrypick but the history wasnt removed in either case.p  pThanks for your time p

Heres what Im missing. Im trying to programmatically go back to the title screen. Im thinking there might be 2 optionsp  p1  End the CCLayer somehow which will return me back to the Main Game View Controller where I can then send a command to go to the Title View Controllerp  p2  Get a reference to the parent view controller of the CCLayer, and do the same as above.p  pIve scoured the internet for a couple of days trying to find what to do, and Im out of ideas. I dont really have anything to show apart from I think I need to initialize the Title View Controller again.p  pAny ideas will be appreciated, thanks for your time.p

Negative 38948 pThere is a LOT of info around about the standard full IDisposable implementation for disposing of UNmanaged resources  but in reality this case is very rare most resources are already wrapped by managed classes.

Negative 38948 pIm trying to simplify load and save methods for several classes which are basically the base class with a few new fields. All derived classes make use of all base class fields, so their loadsave methods include the loadsave code of the base class with an addition of some lines for taking care of the derived classes remaining unhandled fields.p  pMy first thought was I could just load an instance as a base class, downcast to derived class and continue loading the remaining fields, but apparently you cant just downcast to a derived class in C. After some thinking I thought maybe I could iterate through all field members of the base class and copy over those field values to a new instance of derived class, but Im not sure this is the best or the fastest way to do this.p  pBasically what Id like to do is to load an instance of a base class, cast it to derived class, and then finish loading the remaining fields.p  pIs there some way to save the same lines of code in Load and Save methods of derived classes, which include all the Load and Save code from the base class without downcastingp  pHeres some example code the real thing is just a few times longerp  precodeclass Base       int i     static Base LoadDictionaryltstring, objectgt dic              Base b  new Base         b.i  intdic[i]         return b       class Derived  Base      float f     static Derived LoadDictionaryltstring, objectgt dic              Derived d  new Derived         d.i  intdic[i]         d.f  floatdic[f]         return d       codepre

That element codeAcode also requires uniqueness for the values of a specific attribute of its child elements.p  pImagine it like this and assume codelocalcode to be declared as the namespace prefix for the target namespace of the schemap  precodeltxselement nameAgt     ltxscomplexTypegt         ltxssequencegt             ltxselement namechildgt                 ltxscomplexTypegt                     ltxsattribute nameid typexsstringgt                 ltxscomplexTypegt             ltxselementgt         ltxssequencegt     ltxscomplexTypegt     ltxsunique namechildIdUniquenessgt         ltxsselector xpathlocalchildgt         ltxsfield xpathidgt     ltxsuniquegt ltxselementgt codepre  pNow, I need a very similar element codeBcode that behaves exactly like codeAcode, but has an additional codenamecode attribute.p  pstrongHow can I extend my definition for element codeAcode to an element codeBcode with an additional attributestrongp  pVery similar questions such as a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1499836usexmlschematoextendanelementratherthanacomplextypethisa or a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6672311howtomakexsdelementextendanotherthisa point out that instead of extending the element, the complex type should be extended.p  pHowever, they do not address the issue that identity constraints such as codeuniquecode, codekeycode or codekeyrefcode are not contained within the complex type definition, but rather directly within the element definition cf. Xml Schema references such as a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms25610128vvs.11029.aspx relnofollowthis onea. Hence, that would require me to copy all the identity constraints as opposed to the above simplified sample code, my actual document has various identity constraints to each derived element definition  a severe source of errors in the case of maintenancebased changes to the constraints.p  pWhat is more, a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms25614628vvs.11029.aspx relnofollowMSDNa implies a uniqueness requirement for the value of the codenamecode attribute of the identity constraint. While the attribute description uses the obscure term emidentity constraint setem to denote the uniqueness scope, the documentation for a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms25647828vvs.11029.aspx relnofollowcodekeyrefcodea makes it fairly clear that those names can be used to unambiguously identify an identity constraint within its schema, so the identity constraint name must be unique in the whole schema. Hence, even copying and pasting of the whole block of identity constraints will not do, I have to rename each identity constraint for each of its occurrences.p  pIs there any convention for dealing with this kind of situationsp

Negative 38948 pMinimax seems to do a great job of not losing, but its very fatalistic in assuming the opponent wont make a mistake. Of course a lot of games are solved to a draw, but one should be playing for Push as hard as possible for a win without risking losing, even when no forced wins are available. That is, given two trees with the same drawn end position given optimal play, how could the algorithm be adjusted to prefer the one which is most likely to win if the opponent makes a suboptimal move, or make the opponent more likely to slip up p  pUsing the simple example of TicTacToe, a stronger player would often aim to set up forks and thereby guarantee wins. Even though the opponent could see such a trick coming and stop it beforehand, theyre more likely to miss that than if you just put two Xs in an empty row and hope they momentarily forget what game theyre playing. Similarly a strong player would tend to start in the centre or perhaps a corner, but in simple minimax theres no reason since you can still force a draw not to pick an edge square.p

Negative 38948 pIm trying to write a regular expression to sift through 3mb of text and find certain strings.  Right now it works relatively well, except for one problem.p  pThe current expression Im using isp  precodepattern  re.compiler[AZ]4 d3.4,40 d codepre  pThis effectively searches through the enormous string and finds all occurences of 4 uppercase aplha characters followed by a space, followed by 3 numbers followed by 440 any kind of characters, followed by a space, followed by n where codencode is any number.p  pWhat Im looking for is something like codeACCT 220 Principles of Accounting I 3codep  pThis is exactly what I want, except that it sometimes catches the pattern too early.  There are some occurrences in the document that one class will precede the class where the pattern is supposed to start.  For example Ill end up with codeBMGT 310.ACCT 220 Principles of Accounting I 3codep  pI figured one way to get around this would be to not allow patterns to contain 4 upper case letters in the code.4,40code portion of the regular expression.  Ive tried using codecode to no avail.  p  pFor example I tried something along the lines of code[AZ]4 d3[AZ]44,40 dcode but then I end up with an empty list since the expression didnt find anything.p  pIm thinking that I just dont understand the syntax of regex so much yet.  If anyone knows how to fix my expression so that it will find all instances of 4 upper case letters followed by a space, followed by three numbers, followed by 440 any kind of characters that do emNOTem contain 4 capital letters in a row, followed by a space, followed by n where codencode is a number, that would be awesome and greatly appreciated.p  pI understand this question might be rather confusing.  If you need any more information from me, please let me know.p

Negative 38948 pI am myself surprised that this question never occurred to me before but this time i am bothered since i am creating my own application. p  pI have a TaskDetail class that has 30 fields. while updating there could be only a small part of TaskDetail that may be updated like just the endDate of the task. We can use two strategies to update this field.p  ul liAPPROACH 1  Update entire object with all the 30 fields and let the rest fields be overwritten in the database with the same value expect the changed field which will be updated with new value. ORli liAPPROACH 2  Update just the field that has been changed. In this case we would treat Employee as a DTO and just populate the endDate field with new value since it is the only field that needs to be changed.li ul  pBoth the approaches seem to have its pros and cons p  pAPPROACH 1  PROS  Its a cleaner approach.              CONS  We are unnecessarily overwriting 29 additional field for the sake of one field.p  pAPPROACH 2  PROS  We are just updating the fields that are modified              CONS  Makes the DAO dirty looking because we would need 30 null checks to identify which of field have to be updated.p  pThis problem is making me a little uncomfortable.p  pWhich of this approach is an accepted one or there is a third approach I am not very much in favor of using hibernate although prefer Spring JDBC template.   p

Negative 38948 pI have an input control on which I had to add runatserver so that I could specify ASP.NET validators on it.p  pThe input control is part of a row.  The user can add as many rows as he likes by clicking on a button.  This is carried out using JavaScript.  For the sake of identification, each input control is named name using the following naming conventionp  pinputControl  counterp  pSince the runatserver tag changes the ids and names of controls, it could be stated that I am overwriting the name of the control using JavaScript whenever a new row is added.

Negative 38948 pI have many C script source files in the project tree marked as codeBuild Action Nonecodep  pstrongThe problem isstrong if the source file is marked as codeBuild Action Nonecode then codeGo To Declarationcode, codeGo To Implementationcode and other navigation and refactoring functions of Visual Studio and Resharper doesnt work anymore.p  pThe script files are eventually compiled by the codeCSharpCodeProvidercode once the app is running and generally behave 100 the same as if they were in the actual code base the original executable assembly.p  pThe difference here is that the source files are not compiled by MSBuild, but by the app itself.p  pstrongHow can I force Visual Studiobuild process to analyze the files as if they were going to be compiled without including them into final executable assemblystrongp

Negative 38948 pSo on an asynchronous framework such as Node or Netty, a worker thread can be given an IO job, which it initiates along with a callback. Then it returns and picks up a different task while that IO job, be it disk read, DB query, etc, runs.p  pMy question is, after the IO is done, how is that eventcallback picked up for further processing Im assuming in a synchronous operation, there is a thread right there waiting. But in an asynchronous environment, what picks up the completion of the IO, along with the response data Does the worker thread periodically check for completion Or does something register the completion event somehow with Node or Nettyp  pSorry for lumping Netty and Node together, Im assuming they do this similarly.p

Negative 38948 pI am making an interactive benchmarking program that works in console mode, and would like to be able to interrupt current computation by pressing CtrlC or CtrlBreak once, while subsequent pressing should act as usual, terminating the program. However, when no computation is currently performing, the very first CtrlC press should cause termination.p  pAt first, this looked like a simple task. I created a static class with obvious codeEnableHandlercode and codeDisableHandlercode routines, and a handler function with behavior dependent on previous state if interruption was already requested, then just stand down and return, otherwise set codearg.Cancelcode and raise interruption request flag. Thus, when a benchmark starts, it enables the handler and then checks for interruption flag on each major cycle when finished, it disables the handler and propagates interruption request up to the topmost caller, if needed.p  pHowever, this approach works only once strongafter the handler was removed for the first timestrong no matter was it ever fired or not, stronginstalling it again afterwards has no effect anymorestrong  the operation doesnt produce errors, but strongthe handler never receives control when event occursstrong. Is this an expected behavior in .NET event handlingp  pThere are numerous topics regarding codeConsole.CancelKeyPresscode on SO and other forums, but virtually none of them considers removing the handler, thus no wonder they didnt run into trouble. Nevertheless, in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq16101517How to use ConsoleCancelEventHandler several timesa some similar issue was mentioned, but that application was a complex GUI frontend for several external console utilities launched on demand, and the issue was clearly associated with explicit exception raised when trying to add handler the second time,  which is not my case.p  pHaving been informed of previously existing bugs related to console operation in various .NET versions, I wont be surprised if such a behavior is abnormal and caused by .NET malfunction or is specific to Visual Basic Im not sure whether codeAddHandlercode and codeRemoveHandlercode in VB.NET are totally equivalent to codecode and codecode event operators in C. Im currently using .NET 4.5 and Visual Basic 2012 on Windows 7 x8664 with all available updates installed.p  pAs a workaround, I actually dont remove the handler in codeDisableHandlercode routine, but simply toggle a flag when this flag is cleared, the handler returns immediately, as if not installed. However, this approach looks ugly to me, and I hope to resolve the issue and achieve the goal in proper way.p  pPS.

Negative 38948 pIve recently started hitting the following exception in my unit test NUnit code when EF tries to load information from App.configp  precodeSystem.Runtime.Serialization.SerializationException  Type is not resolved for member [my type name], [my assembly name] codepre  pThis happens both with the NUnit GUI runner and with Rs VSintegrated runner. Heres a quick unit test that reproduces the issuep  precode[Test] public void Test       adding       ConfigurationManager.OpenExeConfigurationConfigurationUserLevel.None      here fixes things, probably because the configuration is cached      CallContext.LogicalSetDataFooSlot, new Foo  removing this line fixes things     ConfigurationManager.OpenExeConfigurationConfigurationUserLevel.None  fails with above exception   [Serializable]  removing this gives a different exception complaining that Foo is not Serializable public class Foo   MarshalByRefObject  this fixes things    codepre  pUsing the fusion log viewer, I found that the failure was a result of a FILENOTFOUND HRESULT error. Basically, it seems like opening the configuration somehow causes the Foo object to be sent back to the original nunit runner app domain, which then tries to load my assembly and cant find it because its not in the bin folder. In fact, I confirmed that copying my assembly to the NUnit runner bin folder is another way to fix the issue.p  pAt this point, it seems like using MarshalByRefObject is the best option. However, Id love to here if there are better options andor if someone can offer a thorough explanation of exactly what is going on and why. Are there any disadvantages to using MarshalByRefObject herep

Id like to do something like thisp  pbase.jadep  precodedoctype html   head     title title   body     block menu     block content     include footer codepre  pmenu.jadep  precodeextends base   ul     li Home     li Contact codepre  pindex.jadep  precodeextends base block content   p hello landingpage codepre  ppage.jadep  precodeextends base block content   p hello subpage codepre  pThe thing is when I convert index.jade everything is fine my pages looks like I want it to. But when I convert page.jade I somehow would like to include menu.jade as well,o I dont have to rewrite my menu across all subpages.p

Negative 38948 pI am in a classical situation my company system is based on svn, and probably it wont be ever change.

But the hard truth is that I am really not satisfied with gitsvn, and the more doc I learn, I am more and more unsatisfied.p  pCurrently I think it were better to me to simply abandon my git project and only use svn.p  pI have an idea, which makes things a little bit complexer, but at least it will do exactly what I want.

Negative 38948 pI needed to sort a list in a very specific way by using a tree in a Python script, so I wrote my own quick TreeNode class.

Im thinking however itd be nice to be able to have them prebuilt, that way the source doesnt have to be seen it may or may not be beneficial performance wise, really Im not seeing any issues yet. p  pObviously I could just read a built script like normal, except Im not sure its that simple. These scripts are using C functions that I interface with Luabind. The way I have Lua itself included in my project isnt through the typical include and lib directory project settings. I actually put the source into the project and built it. I know some may think this is silly, but its what I have going on. I was following some tutorials on using Lua and C together and thats how the setup tutorial went, sorry Im rather new to it. p  pI have spent some time searching around the web and here specifically for an answer, but I havent found anything that goes along concerning Luabind. p

Negative 38948 pIm not a web developer by trade, but every couple of years I play one on TV or hang with them to look cool. The last time I raved with ASP.NET was back in the webform days. Back then, having a webbased UX to manage the users on your site was straightforward. I understand ASP.NET Identity 1.02.0 and Federation are designed to give developers all kinds of new glowsticks and pacifiers to party with but its amazingly frustrating to me to crack open VS 2013, fire up a new MVCSPA web app and not be able to easily do something everybody else should need and likely be doing, which is manage their users via some admin UX on the site itself.p  pSo, if youre DTC downtocode, I would appreciate any, simple examples of how to do the following 1 is by far the most important. I can extrapolate to 2 and 3...I hope.. Assume nothing fancy a local machine project using the embedded SQL DB. You know, project template defaults. p  ol liDisplay all users registered on a website AND THE ROLES THEY ARE PART OF. Ive already got everything I could ever want to emdirectlyem know about a user down with Entity Frameworks. But why are roles so nonobvious here Snippets for the M, the V and the C much appreciated.li liAdd or remove roles for a user. li liAdd or remove available roles for users.li ol  pI see the tables, much like the ones that have been around forever, in new MVC projects. The basic user stuff is exposed very easily, but an old, trusted and necessary friend roles seems to require some voodoo, mojo or secret sauce to expose in a similarly easy fashion. Im not far from just mucking with the tables via SQL directly. I know thats bad in the new world order and will likely tip the bouncers off that they shouldnt let me into the party behind the velvet rope.p  pp.s. Ive even seen some posts here and elsewhere suggesting roles be done with claims. While that seems logical, I would prefer ASP.NET Identity 2.0 stuff based on the vestigial of roles .NET types, SQL tables, etc. that still exist.p

I am not able to decide which one to choose as my store procedure returns multiple output parameters. If it returns single parameter then i can choose scalers, if table then entities.

I am attaching store procedure screen shot.img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comdWxrn.png altenter image description hereimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com8XQwu.png altenter image description herep

Negative 38948 pI am converting some existing integration tests of a legacy WCF service to be automated via NUnit.  The current tests call a deployed version of the WCF service what I would like to do is have the tests hit the service class MyService.svc.cs directlyinternally.p  pThe problem I am having is that the service uses impersonationp  precode    this is a method in MyService.svc.cs     public SomeObject GetSomeObject            using GetWindowsIdentity.Impersonate                do some stuff               return null           private WindowsIdentity GetWindowsIdentity                var callerWinIdentity  ServiceSecurityContext.Current.WindowsIdentity          var cf  new ChannelFactoryltIMyServicegt         cf.Credentials.Windows.AllowedImpersonationLevel  TokenImpersonationLevel.Impersonation          return callerWinIdentity      codepre  pThe problem is that ServiceSecurityContext.Current is always null when I call it from a unit test.p  pThe impersonation is important in downstream operations, so I cant just bypass this code and just call what is within the codeusingcode block.  It might be possible to wrap my test code in codeWindowsIdentity.GetCurrent.Impersonatecode and emthenem call what is within the codeusingcode block bypassing MyService.svc.cs code, but this would be less than ideal, as it would not be a complete endtoend test.p  pI do not need to fake different users to impersonateI just need the runners user context to be available in ServiceSecurityContext.Current.p  pIs this possiblep
Negative 38948 pI own both PyCharm and AppCode. I have a C project in AppCode and a Python project in PyCharm. The Python program calls an executable created from the C project. AppCodes debugging capabilities are very nice, but unfortunately things go wrong when the PyCharm project calls the C executables and I cant use AppCodes debugging powers. Is there anyway to have PyCharm call AppCode so that when the Python code calls the C code I can use AppCodes debugging Thanksp

I installed boost. Then I was informed I needed a working version of curl or something like that. After a quick internet search, I found that I needed to install some version of libcurldev. In particular I installed the package libcurl4openssldev 7.35.01ubuntu2.2  After this, curlpp compiled and installed without issue.p  pFinally, I took some generic test code and attempted a compile using the command g test.cpp lcurlpp. This led to the above error. I tried uninstalling curl and everything related and reinstalling it. I also tried installing some of the alternate libcurldev implementations. Same error.p  pI have poked around the net for solutions and tried several other things. Nothing has worked so far.p  pThanks in advance for any helpp

Negative 38948 pWhile working on a educational simplistic RISC processor I was wondering about how system calls work when implementing my software interrupt function. For example, hypothetically lets say our program calls sysend which ends the current process.

Negative 38948 ppeople. I have a question. Sometimes accidentally a window appears above some method with its implementation. So I want to understand is there a shortcut for showing implementation of a method above the methodin new small window  like this when studio shows documentation  In my opinion it will be convenient to know it, because in that way it is not necessary to go to implementation and to go up and down in the code. Unfortunately I couldnt find it when I try to google it. Thanks in advance.p
Negative 38948 pMy project is almost finished and no R.java problems till now.  No new jars added to build path etc. Suddenly the project will not gen the R.file.  All xml files layout, values etc are clean.  I have not installed any new SDK tools for a week or so  the last was 22 and its happy with that. The thing that seems to have triggered this was a typo in my strings.xml file which I corrected.  However, despite a refresh, a shut down, restart, Eclipse continued to complain about the typo and in fact the typo returned to the strings file, but no mention of the problem in the compile messages.  Eventually the mention of the typo went away, but it still will not gen the R. file.  Ive reinstalled the SDK Tools SDK 17 thru 24 but no cure. There are plenty of warnings about deprecation ActionBar mostly, plus a few unused methods and variables.  Ah, something new  The compile is again complaining about the original strings file typo.  But the typo is not in the file anymore.  So, is eclipse caching something somewhere and referencing thatp

Negative 38948 pIn my experience, the most robust viewviewcontroller implementations do all of their element creation and layout directly in the UIView subclass in codeinitWithFramecode and codelayoutSubviewscode, rather than using a .xib file. While one can certainly use a .xib file to achieve the same result, the complexity and maintenance doesnt seem worth the trouble. I recently started working on a custom view controller and UIView subclass, for which I am using the PFLogInViewController from the ParseUI framework as a reference to create this .xibfree robustness that I need.p  pMy custom UIView subclass which I will call codeNumPadViewcode as an example is responsible for laying out buttons, labels, and other UI elements, while my custom UIViewController subclass which I will call codeNumPadViewControllercode as an example is responsible for creating the codeNumPadViewcode instance and adding target actions to all of its buttons, and then implementing those actions. Here is an example interface for codeNumPadViewcodep  precode   NumPadView.h  import ltUIKitUIKit.hgt  interface NumPadView  UIScrollView property strong, nonatomic, readonly UIButton button1 property strong, nonatomic, readonly UIButton button2 property strong, nonatomic, readonly UIButton button3 property strong, nonatomic, readonly UIButton button4 property strong, nonatomic, readonly UIButton button5 property strong, nonatomic, readonly UIButton button6 property strong, nonatomic, readonly UIButton button7 property strong, nonatomic, readonly UIButton button8 property strong, nonatomic, readonly UIButton button9 property strong, nonatomic, readonly UIButton button0  instancetypeinit end codepre  pUsing this interface, codeNumPadViewControllercode with a codenumPadViewcode property can do things such asp  precodeself.view  numPadView [numPadView.button0 addTargetself selectorselectorbutton0Pressed forControlEventsUIControlEventTouchUpInside] codepre  pNow, to get to my question. Eventually, all of the codeNumPadViewcode layout will be done in code, similar to the followingp  precode   NumPadView.m  import NumPadView.h  interface NumPadView  property strong, nonatomic, readwrite UIButton button1 property strong, nonatomic, readwrite UIButton button2 property strong, nonatomic, readwrite UIButton button3 property strong, nonatomic, readwrite UIButton button4 property strong, nonatomic, readwrite UIButton button5 property strong, nonatomic, readwrite UIButton button6 property strong, nonatomic, readwrite UIButton button7 property strong, nonatomic, readwrite UIButton button8 property strong, nonatomic, readwrite UIButton button9 property strong, nonatomic, readwrite UIButton button0 end  implementation NumPadView  instancetypeinit      self  [super init]     if self          self.button1  [[UIButton alloc] initWithFrameCGRectZero]         self.button1.backgroundColor  [UIColor redColor]         ...          return self    voidlayoutSubviews      self.button1.frame  ...     ...  end codepre  pHowever, I always do the layoutUI design as the last step because I want to make sure that everything functions first. I will therefore spend my time implementing methods in codeNumPadViewControllercode, rather than coding the layout in codeNumPadViewcode. Of course, to test the functionality of the view controller, I will need some sort of UI to interact with. I would like to make a quick prototype UI using a .xib file and attaching it to the codeNumPadViewcode. I dont want to change the interface of the codeNumPadViewcode at all, as that would require changes to my codeNumPadViewControllercode. So my problem is figuring out how to create and load a .xib from emwithinem the codeNumPadViewcode implementation. Of course, .xibs are typically owned by a view controller and IBOutlets are linked to properties in said view controller, but I want to shift all of that to the private implementation of codeNumPadViewcode like suchp  precode   NumPadView.m  import NumPadView.h  interface NumPadView  Link private interface properties to .xib file property strong, nonatomic, readwrite IBOutlet UIButton button1 property strong, nonatomic, readwrite IBOutlet UIButton button2 property strong, nonatomic, readwrite IBOutlet UIButton button3 property strong, nonatomic, readwrite IBOutlet UIButton button4 property strong, nonatomic, readwrite IBOutlet UIButton button5 property strong, nonatomic, readwrite IBOutlet UIButton button6 property strong, nonatomic, readwrite IBOutlet UIButton button7 property strong, nonatomic, readwrite IBOutlet UIButton button8 property strong, nonatomic, readwrite IBOutlet UIButton button9 property strong, nonatomic, readwrite IBOutlet UIButton button0 end  implementation NumPadView  instancetypeinit      Im not sure if this is the right way to do it, but Im looking for something similar in effect.     self  [[NSBundle mainBundle] loadNibNamed[NSString stringWithFormat, [self class]] ownerself optionsnil].firstObject     return self  end codepre  pSo, how can I effectively implement this Ive tried using codeloadFromNibcode, but the button properties always end up being codenilcode. Ive connected all of the IBOutlets in the interface builder and set the file owner on codeNumPadView.xibcode to codeNumPadViewcode and the class of the main view to codeUIScrollViewcode Ive tried codeNumPadViewcode as well. In addition to advice on how to successfully implement this scheme, I am certainly open better ways of doing this whole prototyping scheme if anyone has a better method. The most important thing is that the codeNumPadViewcode maintain a consistent interface and that the codeNumPadViewControllercode has no knowledge of the .xib file. This concept seems to be missed in similar questions such as a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5246074uiviewsubclasswithitsownxibthis onea and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions27314818customuiviewloadedfromxibthis onea.

This a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarybew39x2a28vvs.11029.aspx relnofollowexamplea on MSDN, although overcomplicated with synchronisation mechanisms such as ManualResetEvents, illustrates the concepts you use a codeBeginXXXcode and codeEndXXXcode method pair for the connection and stream operations.p  pThis has the advantage of letting the thread pool assign threads as needed e.g. when data is received rather than having a dedicated thread per connection, which doesnt scale.p  pSomeone recently mentioned that this approach can also be achieved using the asyncawait model introduced in .NET 4.5, thus using Tasks and making the APM unnecessary for this scenario.

We can easily replace by instance method, they are surely thread safe in this scenario, since each thread has its own instance to work with, but I feel that may not be required and its troublesome to keep creating instance, when we can conveniently work with a static call.p  pPlease note till now I havent seen an issue with code running, but as I said if this ever happens it will be corner case, for two threads to come at same time and one thread replace the input parameter while other thread is still processing result.p

Can Google play services developer console be used for this purposep  p2  Or we have to generate APK using batch file which contains commands to uses utilities of android and java like aapt.exe to generate unsigned APK file and jarsigner to sign APK file with a certificate. To distinguish between various environments development, test, integration, staging and production we use some sort of PROPERTIES files. Distribution of APK can be done either through Air watch or Google Private market place. p  pThanks to all for giving a time and for useful input.p

Someone confirms what I wrote Or WSO2 ESB is flexible as Mule ESB and Im wrong if so what are the differencesp

Negative 38948 pHey so I am making this project in which the player has to jump platforms all the way to the top. Some monsters spawn randomly throughout the game. So the idea is to lose the game when you hit them from below, but can go on if you jump on them. I already did the part in which the player jumps on it and you destroy the monster but I am still stuck on that part to lose the game when you hit it from below. Any ideas on how I can manage to do this For this project I followed Ray Wenderlichs tutorial on How To Make a Game Like Mega Jump.  So on my GameScene, I have the didBeginContact method p  precodefunc didBeginContactcontact SKPhysicsContact      var updateHUD  false     let whichNode  contact.bodyA.node  player  contact.bodyA.node  contact.bodyB.node     let other  whichNode as GameObjectNode     updateHUD  other.collisionWithPlayerplayer     if updateHUD           lblStars.text  Stringformat X d, GameState.sharedInstance.stars         lblScore.text  Stringformat d, GameState.sharedInstance.score       codepre  pWhich then calls the method from the GameObjectNode Scene. p  precodeclass MonsterNode GameObjectNode    var monsterType MonsterType override func collisionWithPlayerplayer SKNode gt Bool      if player.physicsBody.velocity.dy lt 0          player.physicsBody.velocity  CGVectordx player.physicsBody.velocity.dx, dy 450.0         if monsterType  .Normal              self.removeFromParent               codepre  pWhen the player jumps on top of the monster, the monster is removed from the parent. I was trying to set that if the players velocity is greater than 0 when colliding with the monster, then the player is removed from parent. Then when I go back to my GameScene, I could declare something in my update method so that when the player is removed from the parent call the endGame method. p  precodeoverride func updatecurrentTime NSTimeInterval      if gameOver          return          if Intplayer.position.y gt endLevelY          endGame          if Intplayer.position.y lt maxPlayerY  500          endGame            codepre  pOf course I wasnt able to make that work, and I still cant. So if anyone could help me out on how I can manage to do this, or probably some tutorial which could guide me into doing this I would really appreciate it Thank you in advance. p

Negative 38948 pI currently have a dilemma and Im trying to enhance security a little by testing the limits on my own system. My system uses the basic NetworkInterface and InetAddress classes to obtain the MAC address of the computer, and this is used for security purposes.p  precode    InetAddress inetaddress  InetAddress.getLocalHost NetworkInterface networkinterface  NetworkInterface.getByInetAddressinetaddress address  networkinterface.getHardwareAddress codepre  pNow as my application sends both parts to a server, the InetAddress as a String, and the obtained MAC address. It will double check this by performing the same check to see if the correct details are sent. If they do not match, the connection will be rejected.p  pNow the main issue here and my question is whether or not its possible to spoof this InetAddress, so we can obtain a brand new InetAddress, which will generate a brand new MAC address.p  pIf someone has help in this area it would be greatly appreciated.p  pEditp  pNever mind, this will not work as you can use the method getByNameString in order to create a new InetAddress ip.p  pEdit2 I can spoof the InetAddress, but now I cant resolve the NetworkInterface from this new address.

Negative 38948 pIm building an app for iOS 8. While implementing the selection handling I noticed that there is a difference in the behavior of the selection and highlighting handling between iPhone and iPad tested it on the device as well on the simulator all running iOS 8.3.p  pStarting from a state, where one cell is already selected and the table view only allows single selection. Cell A is the selected cell and Cell B is the new cell that will be selected.p  pOn iPhonep  ul liTouch down ul liCell B  set highlighted to YESli ulli liTouch up ul liCell B  set highlighted to NOli liCell A  set selected to NOli liCell B  set selected to YESli ulli ul  pOn iPadp  ul liTouch down ul liCell B  set highlighted to YESli liCell A  set selected to NOli ulli liTouch up ul liCell B  set highlighted to NOli liCell B  set selected to YESli liCell B  set selected to YESli ulli ul  pThe result is, that on the iPhone the currently selected cell stays selected until the touch ends. On the iPad the currently selected cell get unselected during the touch.p  pDoes anybody know, if this behavior is expected or if it might be a bugp  pCheers, Tobiasp

Negative 38948 pWell in my ASP.NET MVC application all controllers use this ApplicationDbContext object.

Negative 38948 pI am using the coderequiredyescode attribute in a few fields within my form.  I have a search box within the form to autopopulate a dropdown list if the item they are looking for is not already on there.  In my jQuery, I watch the codekeyupcode event for the field.  codeinputsearchinputtext.keyupfunctioneventcode.  I use codeevent.preventDefaultcode right away before I do anything else.p  pOne of the things I watch for is the Enter button.  When pressed, I check to see if one of the search results are currently selected.  If it is, I insert the result into the dropdown list on the page.  But if it is not, I let the form be submitted.p  pThe issue is that when I have required form fields using the attribute, it ignores my jQuery and cancels the action before my jQuery can run and tells me the field is required.

Negative 38948 pI have looked online everywhere and I am yet to find how to create a basic random dungeon generation technique.p  pI have been experimenting myself by randomising a list of numbers and allocating them to width height and position etc. but I just cant seem to get it working.p  pIt would be great if someone could direct me to a website or maybe point me in the right direction, I am a little inexperienced.

Negative 38948 pIm building a site, but Im still pretty new to the whole web design process e.g. I still need to learn Javascript and Im running into some challenges.p  pYou can see what Im working on at this a hrefhttpcodepen.ioANewLevelMediapendoqRPO relnofollowpena or a hrefhttpsjsfiddle.netANewLevelMedia3kcx54ay3 relnofollowfiddlea to see the code and play with it.p  pHeres what Im having a hard time withp  p1 I want the ribbon to extend past the edges of the main container, but it still needs to be centered.

Negative 38948 pThis is not so much a howto question, as a question about how python functions to store variables.p  pAs far as I understand please correct me if i am wrong, when a variable is created in say C, the value is stored in memory and the address of that memory is stored under the variable name. In python it creates the value in memory, and then tags that memory address with the variable name. So that if you do thisp  precodegtgtgt x  3 gtgtgt y  x gtgtgt idx 42 gtgtgt idy 42 codepre  pthe memory addresses are the same for x and yp  pthen if i do thisp  precodegtgtgt x  4 gtgtgt print y 3 codepre  pas it should. If i query the addressesp  precodegtgtgt idx 46 gtgtgt idy 42 codepre  pit appears that python has created new memory for the new x value and y remains the same. but then when i do thisp  precodegtgtgt y  4 gtgtgt idy 46 codepre  pit seems that python has searched through the memory looking for a value that matches the input variable, and then tagged that memory address with the name y  if no such value is found then it creates a new value in memory and then tags thatp  pam i right in my thinking herep  pthe problem that occurs to me that this is all well and good for my little x and y example, but what about a program with millions of variables does this mean that whenever a variable value is assigned, it has to search through the whole memory, looking for a match, before assigning new memoryp  pIntuitively, while this approach would definitely save a lot of space, it would probably not be very time efficient, however I imagine that a lot of people, much smarter than me, have put a lot of effort and work into making python, so obviously this isnt the case. So my question is what am i missing in my understanding that makes this method a good approach for memory managementp  pIs it simply a matter that searching through the list is at most time complexity On, and so with fast processors, this is not really an issue or is there something deeperp

Negative 38948 pI have class called codeAbsAlgorithmcode with three pure virtual functions like thisp  precodeclass AbsAlgorithm  public     ...other methods     virtual void run  0     virtual bool initTestCaseamp  0     virtual void done  0  codepre  pThis class is in my executable, called codealgatorccode. Enduser must create algatorc project and must also implement these three methods. But the problem is this he must also inherit codeTestCasecode class. which is parameter in codeinitcode method. In my main program, I must compile code that user wrote, and build dynamic library and load it into my program. I did that. The problem is when I call codeinitcode method. p  pExamplep  pUser creates new algatorc project called codeSortingcode.p  pSo he ends up with three classes p  ul licodeSortingTestSetIteratorcodeli licodeSortingTestCasecodeli licodeSortingAbsAlgorithmcodeli ul  pIn this codeSortingAbsAlgorithmcode he inherits codeAbsAlgorithmcode and implements pure virtual methods. In codeSortingTestCasecode he must inherit codeTestCasecode class and in codeSortingTestSetIteratorcode he must inherit codeTestSetIteratorcode and implement method called codegetcurrentcode, which returns codeTestCasecode. p  pMy main program I loaded codeSortingTestSetIteratorcode into codeTestSetIteratorcode, like thisp  precodecreateit  TestSetIterator dlsymhandle, createiteratorobject TestSetIterator it  TestSetIteratorcreateit codepre  pSo now, I can call methods like codeTestSetIteratorgetcurrentcode this method returns pointer to codeTestCasecode, but user returns object of SortingTestCase. But when I call this method, as a result, I get codeTestCasecode. This is all ok, but then I need to pass this to codeAbsAlgorithminit...code. Sure, still no problem, but when user implemented method codeinit...code, he must convert this to child class codeSortingTestCasecode. Is this possiblep  pI know that this is trivial in Java, but I dont know how to do this in C. Or is it a way that I define method codeTestCase TestSetIteratorgetcurrentcode and then user somehow redefine this so that return type is codeSortingTestCasecode Would this solve the problem p  pBasically, problem is thisp  pI have method codeSortingTestSetIteratorgetcurrentcode that returns pointer to instance of codeSortingTestCasecode class. So, is it somehow posible to convert parent to childp

I call compareRecursive in my findMatches function. After I call compareRecursive the array variable and the arrayCopy variables get emptied. From my understanding of scope the compareRecursive function should have its own copy of the array since Im passing it in as a parameter, why is Array.prototype.pop affecting the array and arrayCopy variables in my findMatches function p  pWhen I change the linep  precodevar n  a.pop codepre  pTo p  precodevar n  a[0] a  a.slice1 codepre  pThe array and arrayCopy variables in the findMatches functions arent affected.

Negative 38948 pstrongExisting Applicationstrong I have an existing distributed Windows Forms application which is developed using VS 2013 amp SQL Server 2008. Application is communicating through web apis from various remote locations to the central database.p  pstrongRequirementFeaturestrong 1. I have to add new feature that application may be run in offline mode if there is no internet connectivity. When application is connected to the internet it should SYNCH all the data automatically to the server. Also if there are any changes to the database server in central database it should be SYNCH to remote locations as well.p  ol start2 liThe synch mechanism must use the webapis to synch the data and database structure.li ol  pstrongMy Proposalstrong Im planning to use Microsoft SYNCH framework to add SYNCH feature but it can not be done through webapis It has to be done through APIs as per client requirement. Also we need complete auditreporting of the SYNCH process and hence this can not be done without customizing the program for adding SYNCH feature and we can not use Micorsoft SYNCH framework.p  pMy QuestionQueriesp  ol liCan anyone suggest the best approach to do this so that both data and architecture can be SYNCHli liWould be great if anyone has used the generic approach which may be used for all database tablesli ol  pThank you very much in advancep

Negative 38948 pI want to set the handler method for all unhandled exceptions from any threads in my WinForms application. I dont create any application domains by myself.p  pAccording to a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.appdomain.unhandledexception.aspx relnofollowUnhandledExceptiona documentation, I need to set codeUnhandledExceptionMode.ThrowExceptioncode mode via codeApplication.SetUnhandledExceptionModecode method to catch main threads exceptions toop  blockquote   pIn applications that use Windows Forms, unhandled exceptions in the   main application thread cause the Application.ThreadException event to   be raised. If this event is handled, the default behavior is that the   unhandled exception does not terminate the application, although the   application is left in an unknown state. In that case, the   UnhandledException event is not raised. This behavior can be changed   by using the application configuration file, or by using the   Application.SetUnhandledExceptionMode method to change the mode to   UnhandledExceptionMode.ThrowException before the ThreadException event   handler is hooked up. This applies only to the main application   thread. The UnhandledException event is raised for unhandled   exceptions thrown in other threadsp blockquote  pSo, the resulting code will look like the followingp  precode    public static void UnhandledExceptionEventHandlerobject sender, UnhandledExceptionEventArgs e               ...

Negative 38948 pWe are currently logging impression data for several websites using MySQL and are seeking a more appropriate replacement for logging the high volume of traffic our sites now see.  What we ultimately need in the MySQL database is emaggregatedem data.p  pBy high volume I mean that we are logging about 50 million entries per month for this impression data.  It is important to note that this table activity is almost exclusively strongwritestrong and only rarely read.  Different from this usecase on SO a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq61711815260945Which NoSQL database for extremely high volumes of dataa. We have worked around some of the MySQL performance issues by partitioning the data by range and performing bulk inserts, but in the big picture, we shouldnt be using MySQL.p  pWhat we ultimately need in the MySQL database is emaggregatedem data and I believe there are other technologies much better suited for the highvolume logging portion of this usecase.

I need to reload the entire data by making API request and refresh data. p  pFrom uiscroll docs, we can see reload method available for adapter which we are assigning to directive. p  pscope.listAdapter  adapterremaintruep  pWe are passing this adapter to custom datasource and which in turn is assigned to the uiscroll repeater.p  pWhen user clicks on a button, i need to reload the entire result by pulling latest results from API. So i tried by adding,p  pscope.listAdapter.reloadp  pWhen i tried call reload method, it throws exception stating method not found. strongTypeError scope.listAdapter.reload is not a functionstrongp  pAlso i tried by reassigning datasource and passing empty adapter to the scope variable, but no luck.p  pIf anyone has fixed this, please let me know what need to be done.p
Negative 38948 pGiven the KMP algorithm, I know each state has 2 outgoing arrows  one to the next state and one as a fallback. Now, I think the number of incoming arrows can be bounded by 2, but not sure.p  pIf a state codeAcode has more then 2 incoming, then it has at least 2 codeB,Ccode states are falling back to it. If so, then the prefix of codeBcode equals to codeCscode, so codeCcode would fallback to codeBcode, in contradiction to my assumption. Am I wrongp

I need a non ggplot solution.p  pEDIT 2 This is close to the solution I am looking for, except this only goes up to 10 instead of accepting a maximum value as a parameter I will be running this code on multiple datasets, all with different maximum values  I want the legend to reflect this. Additionally, if I change the size of the graph, the key falls apart into disconnected squares. p
