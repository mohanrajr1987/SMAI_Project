Positive 59047 pHow can I increment key value pair inside a for loop while iterating over dictionary in pythonp  precodefor key,value in mydict.iteritems      if condition         inc key,value     something to do codepre  pI have tried using codenextmydict.iteritemscode and codemydict.iteritems.nextcode but in vain.p  pI am using python2.7.p  pEDIT  I know that forloop automatically increments the key,value pair. I want to manually increment to next pair  Thus resulting in 2 increments. Also I cant use continue because I want both the key value pair to be accessible at same time. So that when I increment, I have the current key value pair as well as the next. If I use continue, I lose access to current and only get next key,value pair.p

Positive 59047 pIm trying to write a script that in some way represents algebraic expressions, and Im trying to make it as general as possible so that it can accommodate, eventually, things like multivariable expressions, e.g. codexy2  zcode and other things like trig functions.  However, I need my script to be able to simplify expressions, e.g. simplifying codex2  2x2  3x2code and in order to that I need it to recognize like terms.  However, in order to get it to recognize like terms I need it to be able to tell me when two expressions are identical, even if they dont look the same.  So for instance I need  to be defined in such a way that the computer will know that codex22 is x4code.p  pNow so far, the only way that I can see to make a computer know when two algebraic expressions are identical like this, is to try to create some kind of a normal form for all expressions, and then compare the normal forms.  So for instance, if I distribute all exponents over multiplication, multiply powers of sums, distribute multiplication over addition, and calculate all simple expressions of just numbers, then this might be at least close to something like a normal form.  So for example the normal form of codex22code would be codex4code and the normal form of codex4code would be codex4code.  Since they have the same normal form, the computer can tell me theyre equivalent expressions.  It would say the normal form of code2x2x2code is code4x2x2code and so wouldnt recognize that this normal form is the same as the normal form of code5x2code, though.p  pIm thinking, at this stage I could try to define some weak notion of equality, that of equality of normalformcomponents.  Use this notion of equality, group like terms in the normal form, and this would get me a more universally correct normal form.  p  pBut all of this sounds like an absolute ton of work.  So far Ive defined classes for Expressions, which have subclasses of Variables, Sums, Products, powers, and so on, and right now Im about 14 of the way through defining the function that would produce the normal form of a power objectI havent even begun on the normal form for a Sum or Product classand already the code is many pages long, and Im still not sure that itll ultimately work the way I want it to.  p  pSo my question is, how do you accomplish this goal  Will my current method work  Does anyone know how software like codeWolframAlphacode or the sympy package accomplish this functionalityp

Negative 59047 pAs far as I can tell, in spite of the countless millions or billions spent on OOP education, languages, and tools, OOP has not improved developer productivity or software reliability, nor has it reduced development costs. Few people use OOP in any rigorous sense few people adhere to or understand principles such as LSP there seems to be little uniformity or consistency to the approaches that people take to modelling problem domains.  All too often, the class is used simply for its syntactic sugar it puts the functions for a record type into their own little namespace.p  pIve written a large amount of code for a wide variety of applications. Although there have been places where true substitutable subtyping played a valuable role in the application, these have been pretty exceptional. In general, though much lip service is given to talk of reuse the reality is that unless a piece of code does emexactlyem what you want it to do, theres very little costeffective reuse.  Its extremely hard to design classes to be extensible emin the right wayem, and so the cost of extension is normally so great that reuse simply isnt worthwhile.p  pIn many regards, this doesnt surprise me.  The real world isnt OO, and the idea implicit in OOthat we can model things with some class taxonomyseems to me very fundamentally flawed I can sit on a table, a tree stump, a car bonnet, someones lapbut not one of those isa chair.  Even if we move to more abstract domains, OO modelling is often difficult, counterintuitive, and ultimately unhelpful consider the classic examples of circlesellipses or squaresrectangles.p  pSo what am I missing here Wheres the value of OOP, and why has all the time and money failed to make software any betterp

Negative 59047 pIm on a project doing an iPhone application. We had a Cocoa consultant come in for a few weeks. He showed me an interesting idiom of Cocoa, dealing with interfaces, but there was a difficult language barrier between us, and he wasnt really able to explain emwhyem this was done or where it was documented so I could learn more on my own. I went into monkey see mode, and just used the style he prefers. But its been bugging the hell out of me that I dont know more about the history of this style. Its certainly NOT an informal protocol. Sure enough, looking at emsomeem of the Cocoa API headers, I sometimes see the style he asserted was the Cocoa way. Heres an example note accessors, mutators, etc., each have their own interface declaration without the funny bracesp  precodeinterface AViewController  UIViewController ltUITextViewDelegategt   public     UITableView tableView private     NSUInteger someIndex   property nonatomic, retain ... end  interface AViewController AViewControllerCreation   idinitWithNibNameNSString nibNameOrNil bundleNSBundle nibBundleOrNil withControlleridcontroller  end  interface AViewController AViewControllerMutator   void doSomeSettingStuff  end  interface AViewController AViewControllerAccessor   NSString doSomeAccessorStuff  end  interface AViewController AViewControllerAction   IBActioncancelidsender  end  interface AViewController AViewControllerTableViewDelegate  ltUITableViewDelegate, UITableViewDataSourcegt  end codepre  pYou can see this style of setting up the interface in NSButton, NSControl, etc. Interestingly, corresponding classes like UIButton, UIControl DONT use this idiom.

Negative 59047 pOK, having tried my first TDD attempt, its time to reflect a little and get some guidance, because it wasnt that successful for me. The solution was partly being made with an existing framework, perhaps making TDD less ideal. The part that seemed to give me the biggest problem, was the interaction between the view and controller. Ill give a few simple examples and hope that someone will tell me what I can do better wrong.p  pEach views interface inherits from a base interface, with these members there are morep  ppublic interface IViewbr  br  void ShowFieldstring fieldIdbr  void HideFieldstring fieldIdbr  void SetFieldVisibilitystring fieldId, bool visiblebr  void DisableFieldstring fieldIdbr  void ShowValidationErrorstring fieldIdbr  ...br    p  pThe interface for a concrete view, would then add members for each field like this public interface IMyView  IViewbr  br  string Name  get set br  string NameFieldID  get br  ...br    p  pWhat do you think of this Is inheriting from a common interface a good or bad idea One on the things that gave me trouble was, that first I used ShowField and HideField and the found out I would rather use SetFieldVisiblity. I didnt change the outcome of the method, but I had to update my test, which I seem should be necessary. Is having multiple methods doing the same thing, a bad thing On one hand both methods are handy for different cases, but they do clutter the interface, making the interface more complex than it strictly have to be.p  pWould a design without a common interface be better That would remove the fieldID, I dont why, but I think the fieldIDthing smells, I might be wrong. I would only make the Show and Hide methods, when needed, that is if they would be called by the controller. This would be a less generic solution and require more code in the view, but the controller code would be a bit more simple.p  pSo a view interface might look like this public interface IMyViewbr  br  void ShowNamebr  void HideNamebr  string Name  get set br  int Age  get set br    p

Sometimes this number ends up being more than twice what the highest value on the chart is, depending on how many grid lines you want.p  pWhat Im doing is Im running Marks code with 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 grid lines ticks to find which of those is the lowest. With a value of 23, the height of the chart goes to 25, with a grid line at 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25. With a value of 26, the charts height is 30, with grid lines at 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30. It has the same spacing between grid lines, but there are more of them.p  pSo heres the steps to justabout copy what Excel does to make charts all fancy.p  ol liTemporarily bump up the charts highest value by about 5 so that there is always some space between the charts highest point and the top of the chart area.

Negative 59047 pWhat text to HTML converter for PHP would you recommendp  pOne of the examples would be Markdown, which is used here at SO. User just types some text into the textbox with some natural formatting enters at the end of line, empty line at the end of paragraph, asterisk delimited bold text, etc. And this syntax is converted to HTML tags.p  pThe simplicity is the main feature we are looking for, there does not need to be a lot of possibilities but those basic that are there should be very intuitive automatic URL conversion to link, emoticons, paragraphs.p  pA big plus would be if there is WYSIWYG editor for it. Halfwysiwig just like here at SO would be even better.p  pExtra points would be if it would fit with Zend Framework well.p

Negative 59047 pIn VB.NET there is a keyword shadows. Lets say I have a base class called Jedi and a derived class called Yoda which inherits from Jedi.  If I declare a method in Jedi called ForcePush and shadow that out in Yoda then when calling the method on an instance of the Yoda class, it will ignore the base class implementation and use the derived class implementation. However if I have an instance of Yoda that was declared originally as of type Jedi, i.e. codeDim j as Jedi  new Yodacode, and called the ForcePush method on the instance, it will use the Jedi implementation.p  pNow lets say I have an event that is called UsingForce which is raised when the ForcePush method is called, and I shadow the event out in the derived class this is because Yoda has an interface IForcePowers that declares this event and each class raises its respective event.  p  pIf I have an instance of Yoda that is declared as type Jedi like above and I put an event handler on the UsingForce event of Jedi, and then the ForcePush method is called in the Yoda class, will this event handler be reachedp

Negative 59047 pI am writing a program, more specifically a bootloader, for an embedded system. I am going to use a C library to interact with some of the hardware components and I have the choice of writing it either in C or C. Is there any reason I should choose one over the other I do not need the object oriented features of C but it does have a stronger type system. Could it have other language features that would make the program more robust I know some people avoid C because it can but not always generate large firmware images.p

In my example above, total in strongobjectOfTypeMyClass.totalstrong is all lowercase where the method stronggetTotalstrong has a capital T.p  pAnd while were at it, why dont we need to instantiate the variable total I guess EL isnt actually referencing an instance variable...just a getter methodp  pWhat givesp

My current approach is to keep 3D amp texture equivalent between the devices, but keep readymade images for anything that is supposed to exactly fill the screen  but I feel this is an extreme waste of bandwidth especially when downloading it to the iPhone 3 where all the high resolution images will never be used.p  pThank you in advancep

The macro will use this string and at compile time convert it so that it would appear as a multidimensional array, like thisp  precodemakearray string1,string2,string3,...,stringN codepre  pSo the macro will replace this function to a multidimensional array and cut that string wherever it encounterscode,code. The code above will turn in something like thisp  precodemakearray   string1, string2, string3, ..., stringN codepre  pIm using GCC how can I accomplish thisp  pUpdate I thought I could exclude the quotes of the string using a macro, so I would have a string without a text and I could edit the string in macro but GCC does not accept the declaration of a macro to replace double quotes like shown below.p  precodedefine macroarray  text text codepre  pSo the text will appear without double quotes and I could find the code,code mark and cut it and use then stringify to turn the string back. p

Negative 59047 pI need to build an activity feed stream A lifestream to be more accurate. for a system similar same in resemblance to many popular social networking platforms. My initial attempt was to use an RDBMS but quickly dropped the idea due to the vast amounts of JOINs needed.

So, what would the difference be between storing everything in a RDBMS and using a message queue other than the implementation of the PubSubHubbub protocolp  pAre there more efficient ways to build such a system If so, please specifyp  pComments  Suggestions  Criticisms are welcome. p  pThank you in advancep  pP.S.

Negative 59047 pThe set up is when the user arrives on the page, it will have their information on the page they put in a previous form to review.

Negative 59047 pGreeting, I am currently at my final year at uni doing an MEng in Computer Science, and have to decide on a topic for a 1 semester long research project. Currently I find myself highly interested in computer graphics and would like to do something in this area. My university has however a distinct lack of resources and staff on computer graphics, meaning that an attempt at creating a project based solely on computer graphics would be difficult to find a supervisor for.p  pOn the other hand, it is very active in the fields of computer vision and image processing, which led me to consider this area. I thought of doing my project on some topic related to computer graphics through image processing, more specifically do something with post processing effects. This is however an area Im not too familiar with, and am struggling to find a good topic to research on.p  pSo I would like to ask if anyone has any idea what is hot in this area, what could I direct my attention to regarding post processing effects research. Or maybe something else related to real time image processing which also involves computer graphics. p  pAny input would be highly appreciated, thanks in advance.p  pEDIT Thanks bot h of you for your suggestions. I did have a look specially at the siggraph papers, and I ended up at a topic which seems of high relevance in computer graphics. It seems from my research, that introducing a depth of field effect into 3d rendering is of great interest, mainly due to the fact that its a feature that is highly interesting to replicate, yet is very expensive to use. There seems to be a wide range of material available on different techniques, for better performance or better effect, etc. p  pI was wondering if anyone knows whether this would actually be a good area to conduct research in as in, if it really is of interest in modern computer graphics. I was also thinking of extending this by looking into ways of dinamically changing the focal point to track points of interest. Any thoughts on thisp

Negative 59047 pFirst, Im quite beginner to Android programming, I got some basis in Java and I looked on SO and googled my problem with no match. Ive been trying to make the following a hrefhttpdeveloper.motorola.comdocstoolslibraryTheWidgetPackPart3Swipe relnofollowtutoriala work for several hours. The project is composed of two classes  an activity and a class SwipeDetector which extends codeSimpleOnGestureListenercode. p  pThe solution offered by Motorola website works but I got trouble when I tried to modify the activity when left or right swipe is detected. To test it, I expected some Toasts to show when swiping.p  pMy solution was to create a constructor for SwipeDetector which takes as parameters the codeActivityClasscode and codeContextcode of calling codeActivitycode. When these informations are known its easye to call codemParent.moveScreenRightcode where mParent is the parent Activity.p  pIm aware that this solution seems awful, and I hope I could get some advices here. I can provide more information about the two classes impletentations if needed.p  pThanks p  pRegards, Jeromep

Also from looking at the iPhone 3g you can tell that the grid definitely isnt redrawing every 0.2 seconds  it is much slower.p  pHere is the basic codep  precode voidstartTime      [musicTimer setFireDate[NSDate distantFuture]]     musicTimer  [NSTimer scheduledTimerWithTimeInterval 0.01                                                  target self                                                selector selectorcheckTime                                                userInfo nil                                                 repeats YES]    voidcheckTime      float timeSince  [[NSDate date] timeIntervalSinceDatelastPlayed]     iftimeSince gt 0.2         [self repositionBlocks]         voidrepositionBlocks      Check which sounds need to play and call the play function on each of them     The following line would play the sound if a collision occurred      Sound sound  [[Sound alloc] init] [sound play01.wav] [sound release]      [self redrawGrid] Redraws the grid with the new positions     [lastPlayed release]     lastPlayed  [[NSDate date] retain]  codepre  pHere is the play function inside my Sound classp  precode voidplayNSString soundFile      NSString path     NSString fileName  [NSString stringWithFormat, soundFile]     path  [NSString stringWithFormat, [[NSBundle mainBundle] resourcePath], fileName]     SystemSoundID soundID     NSURL filePath  [NSURL fileURLWithPathpath isDirectoryNO]     AudioServicesCreateSystemSoundIDCFURLReffilePath, ampsoundID     AudioServicesPlaySystemSoundsoundID     [filePath release]  codepre  pIf anyone could help at all with this issue I would be extremely gratefulp  pThanksp  pstrongEDITstrong I have done some tests and narrowed it down to a problem with the NSTimer, on the simulator it triggers every 0.2 seconds but on the device it triggers every 0.4  0.6 seconds.

Negative 59047 pI guess I would need some really good explanation on some Model related concepts.p  ol lipIn general does the model, as described by frameworks like Robotlegs play the role of an application state holder, or a domain state holder I originally thought that models are entirely domain based, i.e UserModel, LocationModel, which play the same role that DAO classes play on the server. The more source code I am looking at though, the more I see stuff like UserAccountModel, ShoppingCartModel, etc, full of properties and methods related to the state of the client application, not the domain state.pli lipI see that the people do not bother to add complex relationships to the VO classes, i.e. if a User has a lot of photos, the photos collection is obviously omitted from the UserVO class. Instead, a bunch of PhotoVO objects are loaded from the server whenever necessary, based on a service call with the user ID. Is that some sort of a rule of thumb  in general keeping VOs as bare as possible Doesnt that increase the possible number of calls that must be made to the server to fetch all the data Moreover, doesnt that fragment the domain model in general an entity User class on the server will always have a photos propertypli lipWith so many calls to the server, it is normal to fetch some objects that might be already on the client storage. does it make sense to make a client side cache, and check if the object that is going to be fetched is already there, or in general, the overhead of getting it once again will be paid off by the benefits of getting a fully synced object from the server. Otherwise, every object stored on the client side cache must be cared for when a change occurs. I personally think that the overhead of getting an object from the server, which might have already been picked up before is not as big. Better have fresh and synced data Id say.pli ol

This is for a homework assignment, and it is the policy of the class that I cannot ask advice on any specific piece of code, so you will have to trust me on that part. p  pWhat seems to be causing me problems is that occasionally, some keys, when subjected to the second hash function, return a value that is a multiple of the prime table size. In these cases, all the indices in the probing sequence are the same.

Negative 59047 pI am working my way through iOS programming these days and am not sure if my program implementation strategies are the greatest way to go about doing things.p  pFrom my understanding, the model should be a run alone program, that is if I were to call its functions through the command line by providing the requisite inputs, the program ought to execute itself and yield the desired results.p  pSeveral times, I find my model and VC interwined together. That is, although the VC is purely handling the View and user input and accordingly calling the functions established in the model, it still seems to me that the model would not function independently without the presence of a view.p  pMy question is essentially framed from this quirk, do you guys insist on your models to run independently from the View controller or is it OK to have them intervined and dependent one each other.p

Negative 59047 pI see Google doing this all the time.

Ideally, the solution Im looking for would be crossplatform compatible and difficult to get around. Im open to any type of solution that can be done via opensource code.p

Negative 59047 pIn my class Im doing validation of custom data. Many conditions apply. Upon any failure, I want to throw a specific MyException. Throwing this MyException takes many common parameters, and one custom parameter based upon the actual failure.

Negative 59047 pIm designing a database that will need to be optimized for maximum speed.p  pAll the database data is generated once from something I call an input database which holds the data Im editing, mainly some polylines, markers, etc for google maps.p  pSo the database is not subject to editing, but it needs to hold as many data as it can for quickly displaying results to the user routes across town, custom polylines, etc.p  pThe question is choosing smaller data types for example like smallint over int will improve performance or it will affect it Space is not quite a problem, after some quick calculations, the database will not exceed 200mb, and there will not be tables with more than 100.000 rows average will be around 5.000.p  pIm asking this because I read some articles around the internet and some say that smaller data types improve performance others say that it affects it because additional processing must be done. Im aware that for smaller databases probably results are not noticeable, but Im interested in every bit because Im expecting many requests which will trigger a lot more queries.p  pThe hosting environment is gonna be Windows Server 2008 R2 with SQL Server 2008 R2.p  pstrongEDIT 1strong Just to give you an example because I dont have a proper table structure yet Im going to have a table which will hold public transportation lines somewhere around 200, identified by a unique number in real life, and which is going to be referenced in all sorts of tables and on which all sorts of operations are going to be made. These referencing tables will hold the largest amount of data.p  pBecause lines have unique numbers, I have thought of 3 examples of designsp  ol lipThe PK is the line number of datatype smallintpli lipThe PK is the line number of datatype intpli lipThe PK is something different identity for example and the line number is stored in a different field.pli lipJust for the sake of argument, because I used this on the input database which is not subject to optimization, the PK is a GUID 16 bytes if you like, you can make a comparison of how bad is this compared to others, if it really ispli ol  pSo keep in mind that the PK is going to be referenced in at least 15 tables, some of which will have over 50.000 rows the rest averaging 5.000 as I said above which are going to be subject to constant querying and manipulation, and Im interested in every bit of speed that I can get.p  pI can detail this even more if you need. Thanksp  pstrongEDIT 2strong And another question related to this came to my mind, think it fits into this discussion p  pWill I see any performance improvements strongin this specific scenariostrong if I use native SQL queries from inside my .NET application rather than using LINQ to SQL I know LINQ is strongly optimized and generates very good queries performancewise, but still, sure worth asking. Thanks again.p

Negative 59047 pIm moving my App to Storyboards and, so far, so good.p  pHowever, Ive found something that I dont really understand and worries me. I would appreciate if someone can provide some insight on this.p  pMy app uses a normal Navigation Controller. For moving forward to new View Controllers, Im using custom segues no problems there. However, theres a point in the App where I want to move back to the beginning of the Navigation Stack. I have also configured that navigation using a custom segue, for that, I created the segue in Interface Builder by dragging the last view controller to the first one that already looks weird to me, and Ive implemented the custom segue perform method in the following wayp  precodevoidperform      UIViewController src  UIViewController self.sourceViewController     UIViewController dest  UIViewController self.destinationViewController      [src.navigationController popToRootViewControllerAnimatedNO]      Custom animation code here  codepre  p... It works great. However, I dont understand why it works. In my mind, the custom segue should be instantiating a new instance of my first view controller and assign it as dest, but it looks like the segue is smart enough to realize I want to navigate to a previous, existent, instance of a View Controller and, instead of creating a new instance, it assigns to dest the existing one.p  pDoes anybody know if using segues in this way is ok Is it possible that it works by chance but might stop working in the future Am I wasting memory in anyway as the segue is instantiating a View Controller Im not going to usep  pThanks a lot in advancep

Negative 59047 pIm trying to find an efficient way to migrate tables with DB2 on the mainframe using JCL. When we update our application such that the schema changes, we need to migrate the database to match.p  pWhat weve been doing in the past is basically creating a new table, selecting from the old table into that, deleting the original and renaming the new table to the original name.p  pNeedless to say, thats not a very highperformance solution when the tables are big and some of them are emveryem big.p  pWith latter versions of DB2, I know you can do simple things like alter column types but we have migration jobs which need to do more complicated things to the data.p  pConsider for example the case where we want to combine two columns into one codefirstname  lastname gt fullnamecode. Never mind that its not necessarily a good idea to do that, just take it for granted that this is the sort of thing we need to do. There may be emarbitrarilyem complicated transformations to the data, basically anything you can do with a codeselectcode statement.p  pMy question is this. The DB2 codeunloadcode utility can be used to pull all of the data out of a table into a couple of data sets the codeloadcode JCL used for reloading the data, and the data itself. Is there an easy way or emanyem way to massage this output of codeunloadcode so that these arbitrary changes are made when reloading the datap  pI assume that I could modify the codeloadcode JCL member and the data member somehow to achieve this but Im not sure how easy that would be.p  pOr, better yet, can the codeunloadloadcode process itself do this without having to massage the members directlyp  pDoes anyone have any experience of this, or have pointers to redbooks or redpapers or any other sources that describe how to do thisp  pIs there a different better, obviously way of doing this emotherem than codeunloadloadcodep

Negative 59047 pIm building my first iOS app, which in theory should be pretty straightforward but Im having difficulty making it sufficiently bulletproof for me to feel confident submitting it to the App Store.p  pBriefly, the main screen has a table view, upon selecting a row it segues to another table view that displays information relevant for the selected row in a masterdetail fashion. The underlying data is retrieved as JSON data from a web service once a day and then cached in a Core Data store. The data previous to that day is deleted to stop the SQLite database file from growing indefinitely. All data persistence operations are performed using Core Data, with  an codeNSFetchedResultsControllercode underpinning the detail table view.p  pThe problem I am seeing is that if you switch quickly between the master and detail screens several times whilst fresh data is being retrieved, parsed and saved, the app freezes or crashes completely. There seems to be some sort of race condition, maybe due to Core Data importing data in the background whilst the main thread is trying to perform a fetch, but Im speculating. Ive had trouble capturing any meaningful crash information, usually its a SIGSEGV deep in the Core Data stack.p  pThe table below shows the actual order of events that happen when the detail table view controller is loadedp  pre strongMain Thread                          Background Threadstrong viewDidLoad                                       Get JSON data using AFNetworking  Create child NSManagedObjectContext MOC                                       Parse JSON data                                      Insert managed objects in child MOC                                      Save child MOC                                      Post import completion notification  Receive import completion notification Save parent MOC Perform fetch and reload table view                                       Delete old managed objects in child MOC                                      Save child MOC                                      Post deletion completion notification  Receive deletion completion notification Save parent MOC pre  pOnce the AFNetworking completion block is triggered when the JSON data has arrived, a nested codeNSManagedObjectContextcode is created and passed to an importer object that parses the JSON data and saves the objects to the Core Data store. The importer executes using the new codeperformBlockcode method introduced in iOS 5p  precodeNSManagedObjectContext child  [[NSManagedObjectContext alloc] initWithConcurrencyTypeNSPrivateQueueConcurrencyType]     [child setParentContextself.managedObjectContext]             [child performBlock          Create importer instance, passing it the child MOC...     ] codepre  pThe importer object observes its own MOCs codeNSManagedObjectContextDidSaveNotificationcode and then posts its own notification which is observed by the detail table view controller. When this notification is posted the table view controller performs a save on its own parent MOC. p  pI use the same basic pattern with a deleter object for deleting the old data after the new data for the day has been imported. This occurs asynchronously after the new data has been fetched by the fetched results controller and the detail table view has been reloaded.p  pOne thing I am not doing is observing any merge notifications or locking any of the managed object contexts or the persistent store coordinator. Is this something I should be doing Im a bit unsure how to architect this all correctly so would appreciate any advice.p

Negative 59047 pI need to format a NSNumber based on some data and user options.  First the user need to select the grouping separator  , or . or none  , if the grouping separator is , than the decimal separator will be . , and vice versa... The number is a currency that is stored with its international currency code USD for dollar , EUR for euro etc... If the currency has a symbol it should be put in front of the number, if not that the code will replace that .p  pSo 1234.50 should look like   1,234.50  if the currency is USD and the grouping separator is ,  1.234,50  if the seppareteor is set as . and RON 1,234.50 if the currency code is RON it has no currency symbol ...

Negative 59047 pI often need to read a CSV file and use it to populate an internal tablelike structure with the appropriate objects like thisp  precodecolumntypes  Car Make  str, Year  int,   Quantity  int, Weight  float  readfromfile will call strintetc., passing it  the string that it finds in each cell t  Table.readfromfilemytable.txt, columntypes t[0][Car Model]   Nissan t[0][Year]  2010 t[0][Quantity]  40 t[0][Weight]  2105.53 codepre  pThings get more complicated where builtin conversions are not enough. For instance, Quantity may be expressed in thousands in some tables. For this purpose, I created classes such as codeIntegerFormatcodep  precodeclass IntegerFormatint  this case is really simple, so I subclass builtin    def initself, unit     self.unit  unit    create object from string   def callself, string     value  intstring  self.unit  columntypes  Car Make  str, Year  int,   Quantity  IntegerFormat1000  no change to Table.readfromfile required t  Table.readfromfilemytable.txt, columntypes t[0][Quantity]  40000 now we know the correct units codepre  pBut I run into a problem when the class that corresponds to a given column is not very simple. For example, class codePerformancecode represents a few performancerelated characteristics and needs to be created from strings like 300 hp, 060 mph 5.2 s, 540 hp, 14 mile 8 sec 140 mph. The specific string pattern will be the same throughout a single table, is known in advance, and I have clean syntax to describe it.p  pNow, I can follow my earlier approach and writep  precodeclass PerformanceFormat   def initself, pattern      convert pattern into some internal form and store it in self.pattern      ...   def callself, string      process the string to obtain parameters that Performance.init expects      create Performance object and return it      ...     return Performancehp, torque, quartermiletime codepre  pBut then, codePerformanceFormatcode is quite tightly coupled with codePerformancecode if codePerformancecode is modified to take into account quartermile final speed rather than just quartermile time, codePerformanceFormatcode will have to be rewritten as well.p  pI can move all the actual construction functionality into codePerformancecode, and limit codePerformanceFormatcode to just storing the string pattern. But in that case, when codeTable.readfromfilecode needs to read the relevant cell, its not enough for it to have the codePerformanceFormatcode instance  how would it know that its the codePerformancecode class instance that needs to be createdp  pI suppose I could do thisp  precodecolumntypes  Car Make  str,   Quantity  IntegerFormat1000,   Performance  Performance, PerformanceTypehp  torque  codepre  pHere codePerformanceTypecode may create a standard representation that can be fed into codePerformancecode, greatly reducing the coupling between the twop  precodeclass Performance   def initself, string, format     standardrepresentation  formatstring      ... codepre  pPerhaps even better, codePerformanceTypecode can just passively store the pattern, eliminating the coupling entirelyp  precodeclass Performance   def initself, string, format     standardrepresentation  self.tostandardstring, format      ... codepre  pThats great. But now codeTable.readfromfilecode has to do something annoying it needs to handle differently those cases where a column is described by a tuple instead of by a single callable. Specifically, it needs to call the first element, passing it both the value it read from the cell and the second element in the tuple.p  pIs there a better, cleaner approachp

Negative 59047 pI have a dictionary that contains classes. However, I have a lot of classes to add to the dictionary and I would like to eliminate the long list of adds, because its starting to look messy. I was thinking of having all the data in a file and loading it to add to the dictionary, but then I realized that every time I wanted to create and add a new class, I would have to modify the file. I would prefer to have to include something in my newly created class that would automatically add it to the dictionary. Im not even sure this is possible, so I would appreciate any help.p

However there are some information regarding the entities that is on the borderline between what is loggingpersistance information and what is information about the domain objects.p  pI my situation these are put in an abstract base class that all entities inherit fromp  precode public abstract class BaseEntity IBaseEntity        ltsummarygt      The unique identifier      ltsummarygt     public int Id  get set        ltsummarygt      The user that created this instance      ltsummarygt     public User CreatedBy  get set        ltsummarygt      The date and time the object was created      ltsummarygt     public DateTime CreatedDate  get set        ltsummarygt      Which user was the last one to change this object      ltsummarygt     public User LastChangedBy  get set        ltsummarygt      When was the object last changed      ltsummarygt     public DateTime LastChangedDate  get set        ltsummarygt      This is the status of the entity.

However I feel it is the wrong place to put it. I can argue both was really. Maybe it should not be mixerd with the domain at allp  pSince Im using EF Code First it makes sense to put it there, or else I would need to create new classes that inherit from the base class in the DAL also, duplicating code and needing to map to both domain objects and MVC models which does seem more messy than the approach above.p  pstrongThe questionsstrongp  pIs it Ok to use DateTime.Now in the Domain model at all Where do you put this kind of information using DDD and EF Code First Should User to be set in the domain object or require it in the Business Layerp  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pI think jgauffin har the right answer here  but it is really quite a fundamental change. However, on my search for an alternate solution I almost had it solved with this. I used the ChangeTracker.Entries to find ut if an entity is added or modified and set the fields accordingly. This is done in my UnitOfWork Save method.p  pThe problem is loading navigation properties, like User DateTime is set correctly. It might be since the user is a property on the abstract base class the entity inherits from. I also dont like putting strings in there, however it might solve some simple scenarios for someone so I post the solution herep  precode        public void SaveChangesUser changedBy              foreach var entry in context.ChangeTracker.EntriesltBaseEntitygt                      if entry.State  EntityState.Added                              entry.Entity.CreatedDate  DateTime.Now                 entry.Entity.LastChangedDate  DateTime.Now                 entry.Entity.CreatedBy  changedBy                 entry.Entity.LastChangedBy  changedBy                          if entry.State  EntityState.Modified                              entry.Entity.CreatedDate  entry.OriginalValues.GetValueltDateTimeCreatedDate                 entry.Entity.CreatedBy  entry.OriginalValues.GetValueltUsergtCreatedBy                 entry.Entity.LastChangedDate  DateTime.Now                 entry.Entity.LastChangedBy  changedBy                                 context.SaveChanges      codepre

Negative 59047 pI have a very long winded question. I have recently been given a task by my employer where I am to create a custom DBF to SQL migration utility in C from 117 .dbf files. Each table has approximately 4050 columns and over 100 rows. Eg. Property Management Databasep  pHow I am tackling it is the followingp  ol liConvert a dbf file into a DataTable object.li liAdd the DataTable object to a codeListltDataTablegtcode which is contained in the model object.li liBind list to a DataGridView for column viewing purposes.li ol  pThis is all done in a background worker which works fine.p  pThe next thing I need to do is allow the user to convert and save this list into a very large .sql file or optionally, migrate it directly to SQL Express. Again, this I attempt to do in a background thread.p  pThis is where I run into problems. I have a method that accepts a DataTable object and returns a string. In it, I have a stringbuilder object which concatenates all the columns into a create table statement and attaches the associated insert statements in order to include the data.p  pThis method is executed in a loop while passing an instance of each DataTable from codeListltDataTablegtcode stored in the model object.p  pNow this works fine up until about the fourth or fifth DataTable before an Out of Memory exception is thrown. I am sure to initiate and dispose of any objects I am not using. I have even went as far as to change all my string concatenation to stringbuilder append logic to take advantage of the stringbuilders better memory management.p  pI am pretty sure that all my objects are deallocated and garbage collected, so I am assuming that the problem lies in the fact that I am storing all the 117 tables in a list of the model object. Whenever I need to access this list, I simply pass a reference to the model object. As soon as I start building an sql statement for all the tables, the combination between the DataTables list and the Stringbuilder object, its running out of memory.p  pI neglect to inform that I am new to the industry as I am fresh out of college.  I have been programming for many years only until recently have I been following best practice.  So my question is to all of you, am I tackling this project the wrong way  Is there a better way to do it and if so, could you help shed some light as to what you would do in my placep

What I am looking for is data level integration  making codeKendo.Gridcode work with codeBackbone.Collectioncode.p  h2Optionsh2  pAs far as I understand so far codeKendo.Gridcode works with a codeKendo.DataSourcecode which in turn holds an internal collection  a codeKendo.ObservableArraycode.p  pAssuming we are going for it I see several implementation optionsp  ol lipOne of the options we discussed is converting our codeEntitiesCollectioncode to a codeKendo.DataSourcecode however this seems to be a non option  the communication with the server has to be done through our own objects.pli lipReplace the codeKendo.DataSourcecode with the codeEntitiesCollectioncode  our codeEntitiesCollectioncode will implement the codeKendo.DataSourcecode API and the grid will work with it as its dataSource object. I dont like this solution since I think I will loose a lot of the functionality that Kendo gives me in the codeKendo.DataSourcecode object.pli lipThe codeKendo.DataSourcecode will wrap our own codeEntitiesCollectioncode and delegate requests to it.pli lipThe codeKendo.ObservableArraycode object contained by the codeKendo.DataSourcecode will wrap our codeEntitiesCollectioncode see a hrefhttpsgithub.comtelerikkendobackbone relnofollowthisa sample implementation I found online. This approach seem to work with simple use cases however something seems wrong to me  I think that the codeBackbone.Collectioncode is not the codedatacode object in Kendo terminology but the codeDataSourcecode object  since it is the one that interacts with the remote server and fetches the data.pli ol

I mean, I suppose I could, but that would become my fulltime job. I need to be able to turn off compatibility checking at runtime for any workbook, the first time, without human intervention.p
Negative 59047 pIve just begun to get into HTML and CSS, and Im wanting to create a design that involves parallelograms and resizes dynamically.  I want four parallelograms, each starting from the top then going to 25, 50, 75, and 100, and overlapping.  The result is what looks like a single parallelogram but with four sections these will carry atags to link to other parts of the site.p  pNow this is all fine until you deal with the right margin and the skew.  The top right of each parallelogram needs to sit in the same place and carry the same angle downwards for this trick to work.  Unfortunately, because the right margin is the distance from the center of the parallelogram not the top to the right edge, this is hard  neither a fixed or relative distance for this measure works.  The key issue is that the right margin would need to be a function of the vertical height of the screen  this would be possible with JQuery, but Id like to try a pure HTML or CSS solution.p  pstrongCodestrongp  pHeres some basic code illustrating the issuep  precodeltDOCTYPE htmlgt ltheadgt     ltmeta httpequivContentType contenttexthtml charsetutf8gt     lttitlegtlttitlegt     ltstylegt         html,         body                   height100                 width100          div.parallelogram                  positionabsolute                 top0                 right0                 moztransformskew20deg                 otransformskew20deg                 webkittransform skew20deg          divparallelogram1                  height100                 width20                 backgroundcolorAAA                 zindex10 marginright100px          divparallelogram2                  height50                 width20                 backgroundcolorCCC                 zindex20                 marginright55px      ltstylegt ltheadgt ltbodygt ltdiv classparallelogram idparallelogram1gtltdivgt ltdiv classparallelogram idparallelogram2gtltdivgt ltbodygt codepre  pIf you can get the two parallelograms to stay lined up, and still fill the screen vertically regardless of the size not as fussed about horizontal resizing, Ill get it to hang on the right side of the page  this is good enough for the effect Im wanting, then youre a hero.p  pPersonally I see three possibilitiesp  ol liSome amazing way of getting this to work just with the correct marginright, width, height and skew comboli liPlonk each parallelogram inside some container, and tell it that it must stay wholly inside the container.li liJigsaw  make horizontal bars, then overlap with white parallelograms on each size to create the desired shape.

Negative 59047 pI have been reading through the past questions on codeGpsStatuscode and I am confused by one issue When I retrieve the the number of satellites used in the last fix from a codeGpsStatuscode object updated by my codeGpsStatusListenercode, how do I know that this is the same fix that has been recorded by my codeLocatonListenercodep  pMy first approach to recording the number of satellites used in a fix was to count them in the codeonGpsStatusChangedcode method of my codeGpsStatusListenercode, and pass the number to a variable that I then accessed at the top of my codeLocationListenercodes codeonLocationChangedcode method. But I would often end up with a count of zero satellites being reported for GPS fixes, and when I logged what was going on, I found that the my codeGpsStatusListenercode was firing off a long stream of different satellite counts, after which my codeLocationListenercode was then grabbing the last one  which often turned out to be zero even though previous ones were higher. My assumption is that this is a timing issue The latest fix has changed between the time when the codeGpSStatusListenercode records the number of satellites and the time when the codeLocationListenercode starts its codeonLocationChangedcode method.p  pA second approach that I tried is to simply update the codeGpsStatuscode object within the codeGpsStatusListenercode, and then count the satellites from that object at the very top of my codeLocationListenercodes codeonLocationChangedcode method see below. However, this does not seem to solve the problem either.p  pDoes anyone have a better approach Or am I wrong to be worried about this timing issue p  pHere is the relevant part of the code I am used for my second approachp  precode    . . .   private class GpsStatusListener implements GpsStatus.Listener      Override     public void onGpsStatusChangedint event          if event  GpsStatus.GPSEVENTSATELLITESTATUS              if gpsStatus  null                  locationManager.getGpsStatusgpsStatus                              private class mLocationListener implements LocationListener      public void onLocationChangedLocation location          GpsStatus thisFixGpsStatus  gpsStatus         IteratorltGpsSatellitegt sats  thisFixGpsStatus.getSatellites                 .iterator         satCount  0         while sats.hasNext              GpsSatellite gpsSatellite  GpsSatellite sats.next             if gpsSatellite.usedInFix                  satCount                        . . .   codepre

Negative 59047 pI am unable to google something useful on this subject, so Id appreciate either links to articles that deal in this subject, or direct answers here, either is fine.p  pI am implementing a search system in PHPMySQL on a site that has quite a lot of visitors, so I am going to implement some restrictions to the length of the characters a visitor is allowed to enter in the search field and the minimum time required between two searches. Since Im kind of new to these problems and I dont really know the real reasons why this is usually done, its only my assumptions that the character minimum length is implemented to minimize the number of results the database will return, and the time between searches is implemented to prevent robots from spamming the search system and slowing down the site. Is that rightp  pAnd finally, the question of how to implement the minimum time between two searches. The solution i came up with, in pseudocode, is thisp  ol liSet a test cookie at the URL where the search form is submitted toli liRedirect user to the URL where the search results should be outputli liCheck if the test cookie exists ul liIf not, output a warning that he isnt allowed to use the search system is probably a robotli ulli liCheck if a cookie exists that tells the time of the last search ul liIf this was less that 5 seconds ago, output a warning that he should wait before searching againli ulli liSearchli liSet a cookie with the time of last search to current timeli liOutput search resultsli ol  pIs this the best way to do it p  pI understand this means visitors that have cookies disabled will not be able to use the search system, but is that really a problem these days I couldnt find the statistics for 2012, but I managed to find data saying 3.7 of people had disabled cookies in 2009. That doesnt seem like a lot and I suppose should probably be even less these days. p

The webserver itself get informations from different sources There is a database fed by an API, and also my streaming servers provide a few XML files that I use to extract several important informations on the fly.p  pWell, my problem started when I decided to create audience alarms based on a watchdog thread, that reads the XML files from streaming servers, update an array with a fix length a long array of 360 places, pre allocated, so nothing that big and is accessed by an Action, which returns this array to be transformed in a graph by a java script routine.

Negative 59047 pIm having problems understanding how I to use dynamic revisions of a hrefhttpant.apache.orgivy relnofollowIvya effectively in my Java projects.p  pCurrently, I have the following layoutp  precodeliba revision 1.0.0 status release dependencies none  libb revision 2.0.0 status release dependencies liba, rev 1.0.0  projecta revision 3.0.0 status release dependencies libb, rev 2.0.0  projectb revision 4.0.0 status release dependencies libb, rev 2.0.0 codepre  pThat means I always keep the status to codereleasecode and use explicit version numbers. If I would change codelibacode during development, say codelibacode, this is quite painful. p  pI save the changes in codelibacode, update the revision in the ivy file to code1.0.1code for a minor change. Then i need to update the dependencies of libb to announce the revision 1.0.1 of liba. Now I could either update the revision of codelibbcode and also codeprojectacode because codeprojectacode is the executable and contains integration tests which I need to run.p  pThe second way is to republish codelibbcode with updated dependencies but same version. This usually works with ant on command line but not for NetBeans with a hrefhttpscode.google.compivybeans relnofollowivybeansa plugin. They still use a cached version of the ivy file of codelibb.code So I need to clean to local cache to make it work.p  pI use a common codebuildivy.xmlcode ant script that is in our SVN repository for all projects. Each project has a codebuild.xmlcode in the projects root that most of the time simply includes the codebuildivy.xmlcode. Sometimes necessary tasks are added or overwritten. Ive just read a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3696831overridinganivydependenciesrevisionherea and a hrefhttpant.apache.orgivyhistorylatestmilestonebestpractices.html relnofollowherea that the solution might be using dynamic revisions. As far as I understand it, I would set the revision in all ivy files to codeintegrationlatestcode and set the status in all ivy files to codeintegrationcode. Then, ivy would always resolve the latest version automatically.  But what would I set the revision of my modules to Omit it completely How would I create a release version Do I need to change all ivy files and set the status to codereleasecode or would I perform a deliver task before publishing a module with overwriting the status to codereleasecode if possiblep

On the other hand, my understanding of a codeweakcode reference is that the memory is only released once there is no longer anybody pointing strongly to it.  So if codebar.delegate  selfcode creates a strong reference to codedelegatecode does it, is it possible that codebar.delegatecode somehow still holds a pointer to our instance of codeFooViewControllercode, even though codebarcode is now codenilcode  Is there any potential for a memory leak here    p  pstrongEditstrongbr So the way Im thinking about this is, codeUIWindowcode would point strongly to our instance of codeFooViewControllercode as the root view controller, and our instance of BarViewController would point weakly to our instance of codeFooViewControllercode as its delegate.  So even when we set codebar  nilcode, codebar.delegatecode weakly points to an object that still has at least one strong pointer coming from codeUIWindowcode, so codebar.delegatecode cant be freed based on the a weak property is freed when nobody else points strongly to it premisep
Negative 59047 pI have a Ruby daemon running which is collecting data, like temperatures. It collectes them every few seconds and, as soon as a minute is reached, it will calculate high, low and average values, which are then saved to a database. Also further calculations will be done in this step.p  pNow I would like to update the Ruby code and deploy it via some Capistrano magic.p  pThe problem now is, if I just stop the daemon, I will not save the current minute to database. If I now start the new daemon, the minute has already been started, so I consider the first minute as dirty and will wait for the next full minute. So, basically, I have a gap now.p  pI could start a new processdaemon, starting to collect data. As soon as that got enough data, it will tell the old daemon to shut down. But how can I communicate between those two daemonsp  pId be cool if someone could point me to ideas regarding this.p  pA Rails app is also available, which is available in the browser. Ideally I would be able to talk to that as well.p

Negative 59047 pI am looking at Gwan as a higher performance way to run our Scala application. Our usecase involves keeping a good amount of data in memory using Scala data structures. This is a bit more complex than a simple hashmap so I would want to avoid trying to wedge it into the KV store that comes with Gwan.p  pAlso there are a number of Clibraries that would be great to interface with. Curious what the process of using a third party Clibrary with a Scala app on Gwan would be.p  pThanksp

Because i donot know what will happen to the numbering system if I write a method to remove certain rows from the table.p  pI mean that if once the table is created with certain entries and then the user decides to remove certain rows, will the autoincrement column renumber itself which will lead to wrong ids being assigned to the corresponding items or not.p

Negative 59047 pI have two folders that I need to codediffcode.  One is a vanilla codebase that has remained untouched.  The other is a codebase that has had some essential files modified undesirably.p  pI want to take the file list and files of the vanilla codebase and only compare the files of the modified codebase with these in order to get a file by file diff between the two code bases.  In other words, I dont care about extra files, I only want to see what file modifications exist in the modified codebase vs the vanilla.p  pI tried a few methods with codediffcode itself and then using codefindcode to pass it on into codexargscode, however I couldnt quite get the desired results.  In the end I nearly started writing a script that would parse the file paths from find and then pass the two files to codediffcode, however I thought perhaps I should ask here first to see if there is a more clean method for approaching this scenario.  Any ideasp

Negative 59047 pUpfront, heres the question p  pYour company will run two applications on a new dual core processor so that you may optimize the software for this processor. A Given that 40 of the first application is parallelizable, how much overall speedup would you achieve with that application if run in in isolationp  pI would assume that the 40 represents the fractional enhanced value for this program, so the old runtime of the parallelizable portion of the program was 25 the runtime of the entire program. correctp  pBased on this, I need to find the speedup enhanced value to find the overall speedup of the program. How is it possible for me to find the speedup enhance value when I dont know the new runtime of the parallelizable portion of this program furthermore how am I supposed to find the speedup overall without that value Also Im not sure what the overall speedup I would achieve when the application is run in isolation implies. p  pDoes that mean Im supposed to act as if this application is the only program running on the computerp

Negative 59047 pGood day, I really hope someone can help me with this. Im having difficulties trying to sync data between 2 devices.

How do I send messages to a specific userli liHow do I send data back to the webserverli liIs this the correct way of syncing data between multiple devices using the same google accountli ul  pThe data will really be a small amount, so I do not need a massive server to accomplish it, and the 4KB limit on GCM will be more than enough.p  pPS Im using Android studio.p  pThanks for the helpp

Negative 59047 pI have a number of cleanup scripts in my Rails application which are all classes that inherit from a common codeCleanupScriptcode class. In order to run a cleanup script, I usually write codeScript.run unless Rails.env.testcode at the bottom of each file so that it can be run through coderails runnercode.p  pObviously, this is not particularly DRY, and Im thinking that there must be a way within the superclass to set this up automatically. Im aware of codeKernelatexitcode, but Im not sure if I can somehow use this within codeCleanupScriptcode to know which script class to use, or if this is even the correct processp

Negative 59047 pI am trying to build a web form which will have its initial fields determined based on rows in a database.  For example, form 1 might have fields A, B, and C.  On the other hand, form 2 might have fields D, E, and F.  Additionally, there may be hundreds or even thousands of such forms, each with a unique ID.p  pNow, each one of these fields A, B, C, etc might in turn be made up of other fields, which in turn can be made up of yet even more fields.  In other words, some fields are actually collections of fields to an arbitrary depth.p  pOn top of that, the user of the form can choose to add more instances of some of these fields at runtime.  Sometimes the user will choose to add a whole new record all fields while at other times they may choose to only add another instance of one of the fields which may itself contain more fields.  Also, I need the user to be able to remove any of these fields that they have added.p  pIve spent about 30 hours so far along with a colleague of mine coming up with a custom Javascriptbased solution that involves building our own tree structure alongside the DOM tree, writing some recursive functions, etc but, as the complexity has mounted, it really seems like we were reinventing the wheel here.  This strikes me as a problem that must have already been solved at this point.p  pIm not very familiar with jQuery but it sounds like it might potentially be a good solution based on what Ive heard about it in the past.  In other words, I suspect that this might be a problem that jQuery more or less solves out of the box.  But, my initial research into jQuery on Stack Overflow and on Google in general gives me the impression that this isnt the case and that a custom solution, using jQuery, needs to be put together.p  pMy question is, what is the easiest way to achieve what Im looking for  The solution doesnt even have to use jQuery I just thought that jQuery might be the best way to do it.  Im not looking for someone to write the code for me, just to point me in the right direction since our solutions so far have looked pretty messy.p

Negative 59047 pHi so first I would like to say this is for homework so I do not want to straight answer. The problem isp  blockquote   pThis task will implement the functionality of creating a list from a string that contains numbers separated by commas with possibly blank space between them. For example the string 1,2,3, 4.5, 6.7, 8 would become the list [1, 2, 3, 4.5, 6.7, 8]. brBrWrite the following functionsbrBr   isnumeric  This function has a string parameter and returns True if all the characters in the string are digits, comma, space, or dot. If there are any other characters, the function should return False.brBr   stringtolist  This function takes a string parameter and returns the list of the numbers in the string. First it should call the isnumeric function to check that the string has no bad characters e.g. letters. If there are any bad characters, it should return the empty list. If there are no bad characters it should try to build the list out of the data in the string. For this it should look at every substring between two consecutive commas. If there is no dot in that substring, then the substring should be converted to an integer. If there is exactly one dot no more, no less it should be converted into a float. If any of the substrings between two consecutive commas can not be converted to an int or a float e.g. 4.5.8 as it has too many dots, the function should still return the empty list. Hint the split method may be useful for this task.brBr   main  The main function that will get a string from the user, it will then call the stringtolist function to build a list out of the user string and then print the resulting list. It will next ask the user if they want to continue. If they want to continue, they should enter y. In that case the function main should repeat the previous steps ask the user for an input, convert it to a list, ask the user again if they want to continue. And so on until the user does not want to continue, in which case he or she should enter n.blockquotep   pThe only piece of code I do have checks only the first letter that is in the string to see if it is a digit or a letter. I need to check whether if there is a letter, number, comma, period, or space. I got really lost reading this program.

Negative 59047 pIm new to working with COM objects and I have read what I can to get an understanding on the subject, but I cant seem to figure out this behavior. I have a suspicion that there is something obvious going on under the covers that I just dont understand. Im automating the processing of IIS logs with LogParser and building reports in Excel. I started with the following block of code in a PowerShell Module I wrote to get the last column usedp  precodeused  WorkSheet.usedRange lastCell  used.SpecialCellsxlCellTypeLastCell ifAxis eq RowtmpLast  lastCell.Row ifAxis eq ColumntmpLast  lastCell.Column ReleaseRef used codepre  pWorkSheet is a valid worksheet object. This code block worked great on small worksheets, but as the size of the worksheets grew execution would take longer and longer. If the sheet was too large it would hang altogether. Additionally, it would start to hang other applications I was trying to use and I just ended up waiting for it to complete before I could use my computer. Its not a resource issue as I am running this on a i7 with 24GB of RAM. When I stepped through the code in the PowerShell ISE 2.0, I found that it was hanging when I stepped into codeReleaseRef usedcode. Im not sure why it would hang on that particular line only for large worksheets. Large is defined by 25K rows amp 1520 columns, which isnt that large for what Excel can handle. Here is the ReleaseRef functionp  precodefunction ReleaseRef [CmdletBindingDefaultParameterSetNameSingle] param     [ParameterMandatorytrue,Position0,ParameterSetNameSingle]     [System.ComObject]ref,      [ParameterMandatorytrue,Position0,ParameterSetNameArray]     [System.ComObject[]]refs,      [Switch]Final  ifFinal     [System.GC]Collect     [System.GC]WaitForPendingFinalizers  ifPSCmdlet.ParameterSetName eq Array     foreachref in refs         ifref ne null             [System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]FinalReleaseComObjectref                   OutNull               else     ifref ne null         [System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]FinalReleaseComObjectref               OutNull        codepre  pWhen stepping through this function, I also noticed that it would also lag on codeifref ne nullcode. I structured both the code block in question and the function based on a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions158706howtoproperlycleanupexcelinteropobjectsthis posta which stated Never use 2 dots with COM objects and showed how to properly clean up the Excel process following Mike Rosenbloms response. I originally had issues with the Excel process being left over at the end of the automation, and went through following this principle as best I could. I ended up getting Excel to close out properly, but the execution was taking 2040mins for some reports. p  pI finally moved to the following block of code replacing the previous p  precodelastCell  WorkSheet.UsedRange.SpecialCellsxlCellTypeLastCell ifAxis eq RowtmpLast  lastCell.Row ifAxis eq ColumntmpLast  lastCell.Column codepre  pI am now violating the 2 dot principle, but this removed the call that was hanging and now the reports run in a couple of minutes. Excel is still closing out, but not as immediate as before. Im concerned that Excel might start sticking around occasionally now, but the performance improvement is worth it at the moment.p  pMy questions come down to p  ol liShould I be concern that Excel will fail to close in the future based on violating the 2 dot principle in that section of code li liAnd, what explains the performance hit for large worksheets on the original code li ol  pI wouldnt have guessed that it would be the call to the ReleaseRef function that would be slow, but something inside of it as I am not overly familiar with the Garbage Collection process.p

Negative 59047 pIve worked with ConcurrentHashMaps, but Im not quite sure if that will cover all of the bases here.p  pI have a Spring Component. This Component will contain a Map. This will simply be a quick reference for objects in an external service. If the map does not contain a matching String, it will make a call to the external service, retrieve the object, and store it in the mapping. Then other classes can use the mapping for quick retrieval and usage. As such, there are only put and get operations performed on the map. Entries are never removed.p  pThat being said, Im a little concerned that ConcurrentHashMap may not provide the atomic control Id like. Fetching SomeObject from the external service is potentially expensive. Id rather not have two separate threads calling in at nearly the same time, resulting in multiple calls for the same value to the external service. p  pThe idea is thisp  precodeMapltString, SomeObjectgt map  Collections.concurrentHashMap     new HashMapltString, SomeObjectgt  public SomeObject getSomeObjectString key     if map.containsKeykey         map.putkey, retrieveSomeObjectFromServicekey          return map.getkey codepre  pOr thisp  precodeMapltString, SomeObjectgt map  new HashMapltString, SomeObjectgt  public SomeObject getSomeObjectString key     synchronizedmap         if map.containsKeykey             map.putkey, retrieveSomeObjectFromServicekey                   return map.getkey  codepre  pThe former is certainly simpler, but the latter would ensure that one two or more threads wont try to simultaneously trigger a fetching of the same SomeObject. Alternatively, I suppose I could try locking out only gets that attempt to retrieve a SomeObject that is already in the process of being fetched and does not block retrieving SomeObjects that already exist, but that would require a wait mechanism on the various string values and Im not sure how to best implement that.p

Negative 59047 pI have a couple of NSTextFields that use bindings to get their values. Each textfield has a custom NSFormatter attached which is used to format the value. p  pNow I want to change the format of this NSFormatter, I do this by setting a key in NSUserDefaults. The formatter listens to NSUserDefaultsDidChangeNotification. This works as long as the value that backs the binding is changed. If that value is not changed the NSTextField does not update. p  pstrongWhat is the correct way to refresh a NSTextField if its formatter has changed its formatstrongp  pIn a best case scenario I need neither references to the NSTextField nor to the NSFormatter. Throughout the app there are various temperature labels that should all switch their format. I would love to be able to start the bindings refresh from inside the NSFormatter. Maybe I am missing a NSNotificationp  pI tried to send codewillChangeValueForKeycode and codedidChangeValueForKeycode KVO notifications, but that did not work.br Right now Im using a rather hacky way, I just change the value a tiny bit. p  precode IBActiontemperatureMenuDidSelectNSMenuItem sender      [[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] setIntegersender.tag forKeyMBUserDefaultsTemperatureSystemKey]      refresh. this is an ugly hack, maybe there is a nicer way     self.selectedDevice.temperature  0.000001     [self.selectedDevice willChangeValueForKeytemperature]     [self.selectedDevice didChangeValueForKeytemperature]  codepre  pAs you can imagine both ways are not a good idea. It works right now because I am just displaying the value. But Im blocking future options to make use of KVO for things that rely on the integrity of the data, e.g. a temperature history, so I want to avoid to send fake value change events. p

Negative 59047 pI have a program which needs user authentication. Now I store the logonname in a Public String, but I want to use more information about the user, like what language he chose to use, his name and stuff like this.

I want to create something like thisp  precodeuser.logonname user.language codepre  pI thought a structure will do the trick, so I created thisp  precodePublic Structure user     Public logonname As String     Public languagetype As String End Structure codepre  pBut I can only access it like thisp  precodeDim user1 as new user codepre  pBut this cannot overwrite the Public Structure, just create an instance of it, therefore other forms wont have the information I need.

Can someone help me with this Thanks in advance.p

Negative 59047 pI am iterating over the rows of a 2D array lib and comparing the first 4 entries in each row to a vector of tuples nearpts containing 4 elements.  Basically, I want to extract all rows from lib where the first 4 elements in that row match any of the tuples in nearpts, and add these rows to a new 2D array sublib.  There should not be any repeats in lib or nearpts.p  pWhen a tuple from nearpts is matched in lib, I want to erase it from nearpts so that no time is wasted trying to match that particular tuple.  I would expect that, since I have a break statement immediately after the erase, we would go to the next iteration of the exterior for loop and the iterator over nearpts would be reset to handle the modified version of nearpts.  However, this doesnt seem to be happening, a few of the tuples are never matched and there should always be a match. I know the problem is related to the iterator because my debugging efforts have shown that the iterator sometimes only loops over 1 element nearpts when multiple elements still exist, but I cannot figure out why this happening.  The code is below, please let me know if more information andor clarity is needed.p  precodeint n  0 for int i0 iltnumPts i    for vectorltmytupgtiterator it  nearpts.begin it  nearpts.end it      bool match  getlt0gtitlib[i][0] ampamp getlt1gtitlib[i][1] ampamp                   getlt2gtitlib[i][2] ampamp getlt3gtitlib[i][3]       If there is a match, add it to the sublibrary, erase the entry      from nearpts, and exit the interior loop.     if match        for int j0 jltnumLibCols j  sublib[n][j]  lib[i][j]        n       nearpts.eraseit       break           If we have found all of the tuples, exit the loop.     if nnearpts.size  break      codepre  pNotes lib is effectively a 2D array of size numPts x 13, nearpts is a vector of mytup, where mytup is a tuplelt double,double,double,double , and sublib is a 2D array of size nearpts.size x 13, where this size is set before any of the elements of nearpts are erased.p

Its even more ugly in a situation when most of the questions dont have any answers and you end up annotating a huge table with zeros.p  pIt would be great to go from the other side of the relationship and somehow group codeAnswercode instances by codequestionidcode field.

Grouping objects by foreign key should be a pretty common task. Is there a better way to do itp

Negative 59047 pI am attempting to parse a complex string in JavaScript, and Im pretty horrible with Regular Expressions, so I havent had much luck.  The data is loaded into a variable formatted as followsp  precodeMiami 2.5 O 207.5 125.0  Oklahoma City 2.5 U 207.5 145.0 Feb 20, 2014 0805 PM codepre  pI am trying to parse that string following these parameters  p  p1 Each value must be loaded into their own variable IE separate variables for Miami, 2.5 O, 207.5 ectbr 2 String must split at pipe character I have this working with .split   br 3 I am dealing with city names that include spacesbr 4 The date at the end must be isolated and removed  p  pI have a feeling regular expressions must be used, but Im seriously hoping there is a different way to approach this.  The example provided is just that, an example from a much larger data set.  I can provide the full data set if requested.p  pMore direct version of my question  Given the data above, what concepts  procedures can I use to intelligently parse the string elements into their own variablesp  pIf RegEx must be used, will I need multiple expressionsp  pThanks in advance for your helpp  pEDIT  In an effort to supply multiple pathways to a solution Ill explain the overarching problem as well.  This data is the return of a RSS  XML item.  The string mentioned above is sports odds, and is all contained in the title node of the feed Im using.  If anyone has a better XML  RSS feed for sports odds, I would be ecstatic for that as well.p  pEDIT 2  Thanks to the replies, I can run a RegEx that matches the data points needed.  Im now having trouble iterating through the matches and returning them correctly.  I have the RegEx loaded into its own functionp  precodefunction regExExtract txt     var exp  [d] [d.] [AZ] [] [d.] []g     var comparr  exp.exectxt      return comparr          codepre  pAnd it is being called with  p  precodevar titlearr  regExExtracttitle   codepre  pTitle is loaded with the data string listed above.  I assume Im using the global flag correctly to ensure all matches are considered, but Im not sure Im loading the matches correctly.  I apologize for my ignorance, this is all brand new to me.  p  pAs requested below, my expected output is ultimately a table with a row for each city, and its subsequent data.  Each cell in each row corresponds to a data point.p  pI have created a JS Fiddle with what Ive done, and what the expected output is a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netvDkQD2 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netvDkQD2a  p  pPotential Final Edit  With the assistance of Robin and rewt, I have come up withbr a hrefhttpjsfiddle.nethMJx3 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.nethMJx3ap

Negative 59047 pIm fairly new to PowerShell and Im posting this on many forums but Ive had success with programming assistance from here before and although this isnt strictly programming, I was hoping someone might know the answer.p  pMy organization had about 5,300 users we needed to disable for a client. Someone decided the best use of our time was have people go through AD and disable them one at a time. Soon as I got wind of this I put a stop to it and used PowerShell to take the CSV list we already had, and ran a cmdlet to disable all of the users in the CSV list.p  pThis appeared to work, but I wanted to run a comparison. I want to compare the users from the CSV file, to the users in AD, and confirm that they are all disabled without having to check all 5300 individually. We checked about 60 random ones to verify my run worked, but I want to make sure none slipped through the cracks.p  pIve tried a couple scripts and Ive tried some variations of cmdlets. None of the scripts I tried even worked, spammed with errors. When I try to run a search of AD either using getcontent or importCSV from the csv file, when I export its giving me about 7600 disabled users if I search by disabled. There were only 5300 users in total, so it must be giving me all of the disabled users in AD. Other cmdlets ive run appear to do the same thing, its exporting an entire AD list instead of just comparing against my CSV file.p  pAny assistance anyone can provide would be helpful.p

Negative 59047 pIm struggling with finding an efficient solution for the following problemp  pI have a large manipulated data frame with around 8 columns and 80000 rows that generally includes multiple data types. I want to create a new data frame that includes the sum of one column if conditions from the large data frame are met.p  pImagine the head of the original data frame looks like this. The column years.raw indicates that the company measured data for x years.p  precodegt cbindcompany.raw,years.raw,source,amount.inkg      company.raw years.raw source      amount.inkg [1,] C1        1       Ink       5         [2,] C1        1       Recycling 2         [3,] C2        1       Coffee    10        [4,] C2        1       Combusted 15        [5,] C2        2       Printer   14        [6,] C2        2       Tea       18    codepre  pWhat I need to do now is to create a new data frame that sums up the values of column amount.inkg for every company and every year based on certain string elements. I saved the string elements in three vectors below. The string elements are part of the column source from the original data frame.p  precodegt vector1 lt cTea,Coffee gt vector2 lt cInk,Printer gt vector3 lt cRecycling,Combusted codepre  pThe preferred data frame would then look like thisp  precodeCompany Year              amount.vector1    amount.vector 2 amount.vector 3 C1           1                 0             5                 2 C2           1                 10            0                15         C2           2                 18            14                0 codepre  pThe general approach for amount.vector1 would be  Sum up the values of column amount.inkg for every company and every year where string elements of the original data frame column source string elements of vector1.  The same for column amount.vector2 except that the elements are different of course. p  pIf there are no values available, a 0 should be added instead a NA error. This needs to be done for the whole raw data frame that includes around 250 companies with data for every company for the years 18 differs quite a lot.p  pstrongEdit For the data frame I need onerowpercompanyperyear.strongp  precodeC1 Year 1   C1 Year 2 C1 Year 3 C2 Year 1 C2 Year 2 codepre  pI tried to write a function that combines these conditions but I failed. Im quite new to R and didnt know how to link these conditions and apply them on the whole data frame.p

Negative 59047 pI have a situation where I have some DTO classes that should be implemented likep  precodepublic class City    public string Name  get set    public State State  get set    public class State    public string Name  get set   codepre  pThe problem is, these are actually DTO classes for REST XML resources.  And the City resource may include the State resource inline, or it may simply provide the resource ID a URI.  I am handling access to the DTO via the Repository pattern and would like it to be transparent to clients whether State is lazy loaded or not like how NHibernate does with its entity classes.p  pSo my current plan is to use Castle codeDynamicProxycode to create a proxy object when the REST Repository detects that the class isnt fully hydrated i.e. not everything is inline.  The proxy object will know how to lazy load attributes as needed.p  pTo actually implement this, however, the only thing Ive come up with is to have backing attributes for all relationships and put the Xml attributes on those.  So the strategy looks like thisp  precode[XmlType] public class City    [XmlElement]   public string Name  get set     [ToOneRestRelationshipBackingPropertyName  StateBacking]   public State State  get set     [XmlElementName  state]   public ResourceBase StateBacking  get set    [XmlType] public class State    [XmlElement]   public string Name  get set   codepre  pThen the Repository object knows to set up the proxy object to either get the object from the codeStateBackingcode property and use that inlined resource case or do a REST request to lazily retrieve the codeStatecode object resource URI case, i.e. lazy from the ID specified in the backing property.p  pstrongQuestionstrongp  pThe issue is, this backing field is pretty ugly.  What I would like is a way to have Castle generate a class that would have the backing property emwith the codeXmlElementcode attribute appliedem that I could pass to the codeXmlSerializercode.  Then my DTO classes could look more like the first example and wouldnt have to be aware that the actual serialising class has a backing property.p  pIs something like this possible with Castle or any other Proxy libraryp

Negative 59047 pI am having one table with 3 fKey and 1 PKey with 6054 records.p  pOne record is lost from that table. I am trying to insert record into that table.p  pThe record id is 2352 and last record id is 9560 so,if i insert the record then it is taking 9561 id which is next id of before id.If try to delete the others records then because of FKey it is not allowing to delete also.If i try to update the 9561 id then it also not allowing to update.p
Negative 59047 pIm seeing the memory utilization of some postgres processes growing up to 25 over time. The postgres connection is established by django which in turn is mostly just creating new records.p  pId like to understand why the postgres process is using so much memory although I did try to work around it by setting CONNMAXAGE to 600 in my django settings file. The postgres processes seem to exist for days though so Im not convinced that CONNMAXAGE is doing anything.p  pI have DEBUG  False and am running Django 1.6.2. Any ideas on how to go about debugging this Has anyone else seen a similar issuep

I must take the imgmyfolder substring extracted from the text, do a folder scan I already have the code to perform it and finally replace codeltgallerygtcode with something like thisp  precodeltulgt ltligtltimg srcimgmyfolderimage1.jpg gtltligt ltligtltimg srcimgmyfolderimage2.jpg gtltligt ltligtltimg srcimgmyfolderimage3.jpg gtltligt ltulgt codepre  pwhere images are extracted from imgmyfolder scan and are unknown when I invoke the codepregreplacecode call. How can I do Is there an efficient way to perform my goal Thanks in advance.p

Negative 59047 pIm making and I made it to work initially, only because I lucked out in that the videos I was testing with were valid. Allow me to explain further. p  pWhat Im trying to do is to upload vimeo content. Usually in vimeos url the number portion consists of either 7 or 8 digits which I am attempting to capture and place them in my show and index.html. I originally made it work and I thought it was fully functional but as I tried to upload more videos, it turns out that my regex in either my model file or my index is only allowing for one digit to be captured. At the beginning videos would play because a url with one digit happened to be valid. So what I want to know is what Im doing wrong. I tried a few things on rubular but I suspect that the regexes that Im coming up with dont do what I think theyre doing. Here is what I havep  precodevalidates urlid, format  with Ahttpvimeo.comd  validates urlid, format  with Ahttpvimeo.comd7,8  codepre  pThe above code is in my model file. The first line of code should work. I want the user to copy paste a url in this format and because a vimeo url has 7 or 8 digits in its url, this should validate the url I think, Rubular confirmed it for me. p  pIn my index.html and show.html, I have thisp  precodeltiframe srchttpplayer.vimeo.comvideolt[09].matchmusicvideo.urlidgt codepre  pputting the [09] in rubular tells me that it should capture all the numbers in the url, but its only capturing one digit, the first digit.

Negative 59047 pIm currently developing an Application that uses a Database  ContentProvider to provide certain location data thats pulled from the network and stored locally in a database periodically.p  pIve verified that the database is created correctly in the Application, and the Tables are populated with data by exporting a copy of the app local database to the SD card for viewing in a SQL browser  so the data not being present is not the issue here.p  pThe odd behavior is probably better visualized through a couple of screen shots of my debugging processp  pSo, initially when I did my queries, all of my codeCursorcode objects were returning 1 for the row count, even though I verified that a codeSELECT  FROM TABLENAMEcode statement should return values, since the database I pulled off of the device contains row data. Heres a look at the debugger stepp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comt0PL1.jpg altenter image description herep  pNotice that when the cursor is initially returned, mCount displays as 1.p  pOut of curiosity, I added the cursor.moveToFirst call, and heres a screenshot from after that stepp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comh2AEm.jpg altenter image description herep  pNotice that the cursor count changed from 1 to 3, which corresponds to the correct number of rows since the application only accounts for 3 continents atm.  Unfortunately, this added line that should be unnecessary still doesnt fix my problem, since CursorAdapter.bindView and CursorAdapter.newView still fail to be called with the resulting cursor.p  pIm confused as to what could be causing this issue, and how to fix it  If anyone could give any insight into what the problem could be, please let me know.  Also, if any additional code is needed, such as the SQL create statements, etc let me know  however, as Ive already mentioned the database is created fine and queries performed on the exported db copy outside of the Android application work just fine...p  pOne last thing, the application is built for API levels 14.p

Negative 59047 pMy problem is this when calling setGeometry from within my own QWidget, it doesnt visually update in my scene, but if I call the function directly within my main window it will update.p  pFor example, in my main window, if I call for examplep  precodeMyWidgetgtcustomFunctionvarX, varY, varW, varH codepre  pAnd the code for the function within the widgetp  precodevoid MyWidgetcustomFunctionint x, int y, int w, int h       other calculations      thisgtsetGeometryx,y,w,h  codepre  pThen I dont see any changes in my application However if I fetch the coordinates of the widget they are where the widget should be in 2D Space, but it is just invisible or somethingp  pNow if I just call this line within my main window, then there is no problemp  precodeMyWidgetgtsetGeometryvarX, varY, varW, varH codepre  pI dont understand why the way I want isnt workingp  pIm not currently overloading the function for setGeometry, and Im not altering any of the variables within my custom function.

With that said, this is just an inconvenience that I dont understand and want to solve it in case it becomes an issue later on.p

Negative 59047 pI have a probably simple question that I cannot seem to get working.p  pI have website with 3 different photo gallery pages. Each gallery has a row of thumbnails with pictures. Clicking on one of these pictures will cause it to appear in a new page where the image is enlarged. When this happens you move from category1 or 2 or 3 to fotoinfo1.php 2 or 3 depending on which category the photo you clicked on was in.p  pThe fotoinfo pages have ratecomment systems. Now what I am trying to do is make it so that I can rate every picture no matter which category. With just one rate.php file that I connect to all 3 of the fotoinfo.php pages. per POSTbutton, it also saves the rategrade given in my database.p  pIve made a function that selects the rating and in which database it should be rating1 ,2 ,3 Now I want after rating a picture for the site to refresh and thus update the avarage graderate text. But somehow I cant fix it so it redirects to the correct picture. Ive tried to do this with if statements and several other methods But I either end up always going to the first fotoinfo.page but never to the one that I am currently on.p  pThis is the codep  precodesessionstart fotoID  POST[fotoID] rating  POST[rating] category  POST[category] gebruikersnaam  SESSION[gebruikersnaam]  function ratesrate, gebruikersnaam, fotoID, rating         global conn     query  INSERT INTO i268296studie.rateusernameID,fotoID,rating VALUES gebruikersnaam,fotoID,rating     result  mysqliqueryconn, query or diequery error  . mysqlierrorconn      return rate   if basenameFILE  rating.php      ratesRating, gebruikersnaam, fotoID, rating     rate  Rating   if basenameFILE  rating.php      ratesRating2, gebruikersnaam, fotoID, rating     rate  Rating2         if basenameFILE  rating.php      rate  ratesRating3, gebruikersnaam, fotoID, rating     rate  Rating3       if rate  Rating              headerLocation fotoinfo.phpfotoID . fotoID            if rate  Rating2              headerLocation fotoinfo2.phpfotoID . fotoID            if rate  Rating3              headerLocation fotoinfo3.phpfotoID . fotoID       codepre  pIn the first row of if statements I tried to check if I was on either fotoinfo1, 2 or 3. and then addredirect. But the second I click my rate button I am no longer on the fotopinfo page but inside this rating.php there for the headerlocation so that after rating I get back to the original picture. Then I added the second if statementsand the rate on top and the globalreturn rate in the function in the hope that this would fix it because I would stop me from using rating.php on all 3 of my header redirections. Because I wanted to check what choice was made for the rate in the query and based on that outcome Rating1,2 or 3 redirect to either fotoinfo1, 2 or 3. But it doesnt seem to work. I either dont call or use my variables correctly insideoutside of the function or... my entire way of thinking behinds this is wrong.p  pI hope that I explained my question properly, Im new here so if theres anything I can change to help you guys, help me better, dont be afraid to tell me p  pedit the code related to the rating from the fotoinfo.php pagesp  precodequery  SELECT FORMATAVGrating,2 AS rating FROM Rating WHERE fotoID  fotoID       result  mysqliqueryconn, query or diequery error  . mysqlierrorconn      rating  mysqlifetchassocresult get database result              ltform methodpost actionrating.php  enctypemultipartformdatagt                 ltinput typehidden namefotoID valueltphp echo foto[fotoID] gtgt                 ltlabel forratinggt Grade this picture ltlabelgt                 ltinput typeradio namerating value1gt1                 ltinput typeradio namerating value2gt2                 ltinput typeradio namerating value3gt3                 ltinput typeradio namerating value4gt4                 ltinput typeradio namerating value5gt5                 ltbrgtltbrgt                 ltinput typesubmit namesubmit valueSubmit gradegt                 ltbrgtltbrgt                 Avarage grade ltphp echo rating[rating] gt             ltformgt  codepre

Negative 59047 pIm having lots of trouble getting some previouslyworking Karma tests to run having updated a few libs. I think Ive inadvertently got new versions of a few packages with npm that didnt really need updating.p  pIve updated to Ionic beta 14 and therefore AngularJS 1.3.6 from 1.2.x but I suspect its another update thats the problem since Im getting errors before it even reaches any actual tests.

Negative 59047 pLets say I am offering a SaaS with 20 monthly subscription. Each month, each client is billed with 20 and their credit cards are charged. Sometimes those chargespayments fail. This is where dunning failed payment management kicks in.p  pThe standard procedure seems to be to keep trying to charge the card for about 2 weeks and then cancel the subscription. That seems simple enough.p  pHowever, during these 2 weeks, the SaaS is fully functional for them  they can use it just as if they had successfully paid for the service. In the end, if they do not update their credit card details or their card is still maxed out on 14th day, the subscriptions is cancelled, but the customer essentially had 2 weeks of free use, which actually should have cost them 203014  9.33. Effectively, this is the amount that the customer owes me.p  pMy question is, are there any best practices when it comes to handling that owed amount What should happen if the same client resubscribes later Should I try and charge them with 20  9.33 subscription price  amount owed, or is this 9.33 considered lost incomep  pAre there any examples of recurring payment servicesproviders who deal with such thingsp

Negative 59047 pBefore ask my question, I want to let you know what stage I am on. I have already implemented TCPIP socket on my android app, it works fineso far....The connection between clientmy android app side and server side is codeshort connectioncode which is when a user submit information, a new thread will be created to send the message out, on the server side, once the server got the message, the server will respond RCVD, after that the socket will be closed and then the connection is closed. My app has a lot of interactions between user side and server side, therefore it does many codeconnectcode and codedisconnectcode between clients and server, so I always worry about the socket communications will drain phone battery and the performance will be affected.p  pRecently I find codeOkHttpcode on github and a lot of people suggest using it.

Negative 59047 pI apologise for any duplication here, Ive already tried running a search on this topic without success.

Negative 59047 pWe have an application which is destined for https so the data being transmitted is protected or should I say as protected as need be I would like to know about protectinghiding or similar queryString values.  Its a jQueryJavascript front end which communicates using a mixture of GET and POST with the database via classic ASP web services.  The web services sends JSON back to the client.p  pI realize the front end code could be changed so everything is passed using POST  however the application is finished and tested ready to deploy.  There are some key values that are being passed in the querystring which should not have been.  Is it possible to make it so the querystring values can not be inspected or sniffed.  The URL and querystring together will provide a direct link to the raw JSON.  We would like to prevent this.    Perhaps there is some jQueryAJAX feature which can be explored.    Perhaps some server IIS level tactic I guess the sniffing occur before the request gets the the server where the webservice sites therefore some serverIIS level tactic is not an option.p  pAny ideasadvice would be great, thank you.    p

Negative 59047 pMy question is how would I not allow duplicate values into an array For example I have a program that is supposed to take five user input values that are between 10 and 100, and put them into an array. Also it is supposed to tell if the value the user is imputing currently is a duplicate to one found in the array currently. If so it is not supposed to record the value, and at the end of five inputs it is supposed to output the array with only unique values. So for example is the user input 12, 16, 30, 30, 99, the end output would be 12, 16, 30, 99. How would I eliminate the duplicatesp

Negative 59047 pI want an efficient and flexible way to parse person full name and standardize its format.p  pThe name can be found in different formats according to culture, can be composed of different parts first, last, middle, initial, title, suffix, prefix, generational... and some of the name parts should be predefined in a configurable list of valuesp  pFor example, the name formats patterns can bep  ul lifirstname lastname               like John Smithli lilastname, firstname              like Smith, Johnli lifirstname middlename lastname   like John Michael Smithli lifirstname initial lastname       like John M. Smithli lititle firstname lastname         like Dr. John Smithli lititle firstname lastname suffix  like Dr. John Smith II and so on...li ul  pFor example, the predefined list of value can bep  ul liFor title part, the values can be Dr., Doctor, Mr., Mrs. , ....li liFor Suffix part, the values can be First, Second, I, II, III ...  and so on...li ul  pSo, I need an efficient way, libraries or tools in java to parse the different name formats and finally generate a standard format so it can be used later in the application. This functionality is part of a batch job, it should be fast, the user should be able to define the different patterns and the name parts that contains fixed value as a configuration.p

Negative 59047 pI have a business requirement where I need to expose set of custom properties defined by user and since this is user configuration, I cannot go away by creating classes. Therefore I need to opt for open types feature in Odata.p  pQ1. Is there any sample implementation out there on how I can persist the data to database and also support the querying capabilities on open typesp  pQ2. One issue I noticed is currently client library is not correctly handling open types and can only be achieved by partial classes that means user has to know the custom properties up front so that they can hand craft partial classes which is not what I want to do. Instead better approach would have been to support open types on client side by dynamic properties. Any pointers on how the client side experience can be optimized.p

The report, commissioned by Oncor Electric Delivery Company, a Transmission and Distribution Service Provider TDSP in Texas, evaluates whether storage could be costeffectively deployed from the perspectives of retail customers, wholesale electricity market participants, and the combined system or ampldquosociety as a wholeamprdquo while maintaining wholesale power prices that continue to support necessary generation investments. The recently released report is a followup to preliminary results released in November 2014.ltpgtltpgtThe Brattle report estimates that 3,000 to 5,000 MW of gridintegrated, distributed electricity storage would be the most costeffective from an ERCOT systemwide societal perspective based on a forecast of installed cost of storage of approximately 350kWh. The authors identify four components of storage value from a systemwide perspective to estimate net benefits, including avoided distribution outages, deferred transmission and distribution TampD investment, avoided new generation or demandside capacity investments, and electricity production cost savings. From an electricity customeramprsquos perspective, deploying storage across ERCOT would decrease customer bills slightly and additionally provide significant reliability benefits in the form of reduced power outages for customers located in areas where storage is installed.ltpgtltpgtampldquoConsidering both the impact on electricity bills and improved reliability of gridintegrated storage, the customer benefits would significantly exceed costs,amprdquo said Judy Chang, a Brattle principal and lead author of the study. ampldquoHowever, while beneficial from an integrated, systemwide perspective, an efficient scale of storage deployment would not be reached if deployed by merchant developers who rely solely on participation in the wholesale market, or by retail customers who use it solely for backup power, or by wires companies who deploy it solely for capturing TampD benefits. These entities, independently and separately, will not be able to capture the full value of the storage to viably support the magnitude of investment that could be costeffective for ERCOT.amprdquoltpgtltpgtThe authors show that enabling costeffective investments in electricity storage will require a regulatory framework that helps investors capture the combined values of storage from the wholesale market, the TampD systems, and customer outage reduction. Thus, the authors recommend a regulatory framework that would involve allowing the transmission and distribution companies to deploy the electricity storage on the distribution system and ampldquoauction offamprdquo to independent third parties the rights to use the storage facilities for participation in the wholesale market.ltpgtltpgtampldquoThe Value of Distributed Electricity Storage in Texas Proposed Policy for Enabling GridIntegrated Storage Investments,amprdquo is authored by Ms. Chang, Johannes Pfeifenberger, Kathleen Spees, and Matthew Davis, with the support of Brattle research analysts.

This file is selfcontained, so you dont  need to use the Makefile in Google Tests source tree.  Please tweak  it to suit your environment and project.  You may want to move it to  your projects root directory.   SYNOPSIS     make [all]   makes everything.    make TARGET  makes the given target.    make clean   removes all files generated by make.   Please tweak the following variable definitions as needed by your  project, except GMOCKHEADERS and GTESTHEADERS, which you can use  in your own targets but shouldnt modify.   Points to the root of Google Test, relative to where this file is.  Remember to tweak this if you move this file, or if you want to use  a copy of Google Test at a different location. GTESTDIR  .gtest1.7.0   Points to the root of Google Mock, relative to where this file is.  Remember to tweak this if you move this file. GMOCKDIR  .gmock1.7.0   Where to find user code. USERDIR  . PRODUCTIONCODEDIR  ..   Flags passed to the preprocessor.  Set Google Test and Google Mocks header directories as system  directories, such that the compiler doesnt generate warnings in  these headers. CPPFLAGS  isystem GTESTDIRinclude isystem GMOCKDIRinclude   Flags passed to the C compiler. CXXFLAGS  g Wall Wextra pthread   All tests produced by this Makefile.  Remember to add new tests you  created to the list. TESTS  UnitTest   All Google Test headers.  Usually you shouldnt change this  definition. GTESTHEADERS  GTESTDIRincludegtest.h                  GTESTDIRincludegtestinternal.h   All Google Mock headers. Note that all Google Test headers are  included here too, as they are included by Google Mock headers.  Usually you shouldnt change this definition.  GMOCKHEADERS  GMOCKDIRincludegmock.h                  GMOCKDIRincludegmockinternal.h                  GTESTHEADERS   Housekeeping build targets.  all  TESTS  clean      rm f TESTS gmock.a gmockmain.a .o   Builds gmock.a and gmockmain.a.  These libraries contain both  Google Mock and Google Test.  A test should link with either gmock.a  or gmockmain.a, depending on whether it defines its own main  function.  Its fine if your test only uses features from Google  Test and not Google Mock.   Usually you shouldnt tweak such internal variables, indicated by a  trailing . GTESTSRCS  GTESTDIRsrc.cc GTESTDIRsrc.h GTESTHEADERS GMOCKSRCS  GMOCKDIRsrc.cc GMOCKHEADERS   For simplicity and to avoid depending on implementation details of  Google Mock and Google Test, the dependencies specified below are  conservative and not optimized.

Negative 59047 pGiven two systems consisting of set of sets of numbers, I would like to know if they are isomorphic under permutation.p  pFor example  1,2,3,4,5,2,4,5,6,7,2,3,4,6,7 is a system of 3 sets of 5 numbers. 1,2,3,4,6,2,3,5,6,7,2,3,4,8,9 is a another system of 3 sets of 5 numbers. I want to check if these systems are isomorphic.p  pThere are not. The first system uses numbers  1,2,3,4,5,6,7 , the second one uses numbers  1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. p  pHere is another example. 1,2,3, 1,2,4, 3,4,5 and 1,2,4, 1,3,5, 2,3,5. Those two systems of 3 sets of 3 numbers are isomorphic. p  pIf I use permutation 5 3 1 2 4 where 1 becomes 5, 2 becomes 3, etc. The first set becomes 5,3,1. The second becomes 5,3,2. The third one becomes 1,2,4. So the transformed system by this permutation is 5,3,1,5,3,2,1,2,4 that is equivalently rewritten to 1,2,4,1,3,5,2,3,5 as I am not interested in order. This is the second system, so the answer is yes.p  pCurrently, on the first example, I apply all 9 permutations of 1,2,3,...,9 to the first system and check if I can get the second one. It gives me an answer, but very slowly.p  pIs there a clever algorithm p  pI only want the answer, yes or no. I am not interested in getting a permutation that transform the first system to the second one.p

Negative 59047 pI have the very common use case of redirecting the user to login on session expiry. I am using angularhttpauth for the purpose. It stores all requests in httpBuffer that returned 401 and fires them again when authService.loginConfirmed is called.p  pThis led me to the problem of login request also being fired again on loginConfirmed. On following the docs, I discovered that ignoreAuthModule has to be set to true in the config for the login call so that it is not fired again. But on doing so, none of the requests in httpBuffer are now getting fired.p  pAny suggesionsp  pdiv classsnippet datalangjs datahidefalse div classsnippetcode pre classsnippetcodejs langjs prettyprintoverridecodehttpignoreAuthModule true, method POST, url userlogin, data loginData        .successfunction            angular.elementloginModal.modalhide          authService.loginConfirmed              .errorfunction data, status          if status  401            scope.error  Incorrect username andor password          else            scope.error  An error occurred   data  .reason                  authService.loginCancelled       codepre div div p  pSolutionp  pWas able to identify the issue. authService.loginCancelled clears the buffer.

Negative 59047 pI have on hand a system of databasedriven entities which very seriously use the relational aspect of the database.p  pLike for example, a table to describe animals. Then a table to describe insects. Then a table that describes relationships between animals and insects and the nature of it. This table is keyed by foreign keys from the first two tables.p  pIn the end, I get an entity Animal that looks like thisp  pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecodepublic class Animal  Guid ID String Name RangeltIntgt mass Enum physique Enum dietType Enum lifestyleType IQUeryableltInsectsgt insects  codepre  pWhere each Insects is like thisp  pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecodepublic class Insects Guid ID Guid animalID Guid insectID Animal animal Insect insect Enum relationship  codepre  pRelationships can be something like animal eats insect, or insect feeds on animal corpse, or symbiosis, or parasitic, etcp  pThe entity Insect is as followsp  pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecodepublic class Insect Guid ID String name Enum wingType Enum socialStructure String camouflage IQueryableltAnimalsgt animals  codepre  pWhere each Animals is an alias for entity Insects we saw previously.p  pSo when I create a new EcosystemEntities db, I can query it for lets say codedb.Animals.Wherex gt x.Name.ContainsLupus.ToListcodep  pThis gives me a List where each Animal contains a List, where each Insects contains an Insect, where Insect contains List, where each Animals contains an Animal, where each Animal  et cetera.p  pPotentially I can have any single Animal, through these links, connected to all other insects and animals in the database. When I have a single Animal variable like that, is it defacto equivalent to loading whole codeEcosystemEntities dbcode into memory, just more difficult to traverse What happens to a List Does it essentially have codeEcosystemEntities dbcode repeated i times Would I be better off using a single codeEcosystemEntities dbcode and multiple codeListltGuidgtcode by which I would use codedb.Insects.Wherei gt db.Relationships.Wherer gt animalIDs.Containsr.animalID.Containsi.ID.Selecti gt i.name.ToListcode Should I be worried about performance when Im using Linq in this context p  pMy database can describe tens of thousands of distinct entities across, say, 15 types, and the number of connections between just two strongtypesstrong of entities is in hundreds of thousands or even over a million.p

Negative 59047 pThis code takes an input image and produces an output image dimensioned twice as large. The first four lines in the inner loop write four identicalsized copies of the original, the last four lines should overwrite the small images with one copy of the input image twice as large as the original.p  pThe code compiles and runs without error on Java 8 Update 45 on Windows 8. The resulting image is not, as expected, one large copy of the input. The lower half of the output is as expected, but the upper half consists of the two originalsized copies of the input written by the first two lines inside the loop. Commenting out these two lines leads to the initally expected result, so it seems that the first two lines get executed last, not first, despite appearing first in the source code.p  pstrongIs this a compiler bug, a race condition in the runtime, or a brain fart on my behalfstrongp  pIf requested, Ill put up examples somewhere.p  precodeimport java.awt.image. import java.io. import javax.imageio. class HelloWorldApp      public static void mainString[] orgs throws IOException           BufferedImage pic  ImageIO.readnew Filecat.jpg          int wpic.getWidth,hpic.getHeight         BufferedImage out  new BufferedImageww,hh,pic.getType         for int y0ylthy              for int x0xltwx                  int pixel  pic.getRGBx,y                  write four small copies                 out.setRGBx    ,y    ,pixel  these two lines apparently are                 out.setRGBxw  ,y    ,pixel  executed after the remaining six                 out.setRGBx    ,yh  ,pixel                 out.setRGBxw  ,yh  ,pixel                  overwrite with one large copy                 out.setRGBxx  ,yy  ,pixel                 out.setRGBxx1,yy  ,pixel                 out.setRGBxx  ,yy1,pixel                 out.setRGBxx1,yy1,pixel                                ImageIO.writeout, bmp, new File.cat.bmp        codepre

Negative 59047 pfriends. New to stackoverflow, here, and also to JavaFX. Apologies if I mess up any nomenclature and if this is a little longwinded, but I did whittle my code down to a minimal working example. the code below hangs up unless you comment out the while loop, as mentioned in the code itselfp  pIm trying to figure out how I can have a codeSlidercode change its value continuously after clicking a wake button and stop changing value after clicking a sleep button. For the sake of argument, say it changes value randomly to an integer between 0 and 99.p  pFrom what Ive a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions22772379updatinguifromdifferentthreadsinjavafxreada so a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions14674274multithreadinginjavafxhangstheuifara and Ive read a lot, but these are the two most recent examples, it seems I should be able to use codePlatform.runLatercode or codeupdateMessengercode to avoid running an infinitetillmysleepbuttonbreaksit loop on the UI thread. I so far have failed in implementing the former, and Im still not sure how to implement the latter.p  pI also tried learning about property bindings so that I could have the codeSlider.valuePropertycode change in the UI thread changing a UI element in the UI thread makes sense... right while changing an intermediate variable, which I called codestatecode and created from a class codestateObjectcode, on a background thread. After the background thread calculates the value I want to give to the slider, it changes the codestatecodes value, which is bound to the codeSlidercodes value. I thought separating the value calculation into a background thread and codeSlidercode valuechanging into the UI thread would do the trick, but I keep getting the hangup or infamous codeIllegalStateExceptioncode exception, codeNot on FX application threadcodep  pIm not wholly sure how the codePlatform.runLatercode magic is supposed to work, but I still get a hangup whether I run my runnable interface inside that or a codeThreadcode.p  pAny help or explanation as to why these attempts have failedhow to make things work would be greatly appreciated.p  pCheers, Mikep  precodeimport javafx.application. import javafx.stage. import javafx.scene. import javafx.scene.layout. import javafx.scene.control. import javafx.geometry.

Negative 59047 pIn my projects there are around 100 screens and I have made it for iPhone 5 UI, all are working and look proper in iPhone 5 UI and for iPhone 6 and 6 plus I am using same storyboard and auto scaling working for that. Issue I am facing that fonts and images which are scaled in iPhone 6 and 6 plus look slight blurry then it look in iPhone 5 UI. Is there any method or way where I can show font and images perfect for iPhone 6 and 6 plus UI as well using single storyboard which made in iPhone 5. If anyone have any solution to make it perfect please guide. screens are many, I do not want to create separate storyboard for iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 plus as there are many screen in project. Help is very much appriciatable. Thanks.p
Negative 59047 pIm still relatively new to JQM and just attempted to upgrade to 1.3.2. Im aware that JQM loads subsequent page request into the DOM and then transitions over while keeping the first page as part of the DOM.p  pWhat Im noticing in 1.3.2 is that on any subsequent page request my first click on the page adds the classes codeuimobileviewporttransitioning viewportfadecode to my body tag.  As part of the codeuimobileviewporttransitioningcode class comes an codeoverflowhiddencode property effectively preventing the user from scrolling further down the page.p  pI know I can just add a custom CSS rule along the lines ofp  precodebody.uimobileviewport     overflowvisible     overflowxhidden  codepre  pOr potentially use relexternal for all of my links, but I have questions.p  ol liWhat is the purpose of this as a default feature  I can understand sometimes you may want this type of functionality, but I cant see it as the defacto for all of your pages.li liIs there effectively some JQM event I can listen for and set an option to prevent this from happeningli ol  pstrongEDITstrong The above CSS styles do not in fact correct the issue. Instead this seems to workp  precodebody.uimobileviewport .uipage     height99.9     overflowvisible  codepre  pInstead of using codeimportantcode I just made sure this css class was after the JQM css stylesheet.

Im still curious if there is a way to prevent it which is already built into JQM.p

Negative 59047 pI have a C Windows Forms project that I created.p  pWhen i click Publish it deploys this clickonce application that is only for a single user. If I run the install on my admin account, then there is a shortcut in my AppData that i can click on to run my program. If I try copying that shortcut to CusersPublic what happens is that another clickonce application gets placed on the users desktop. That user then has to run the install and is annoying cause If i have an update, each user has to uninstall and reinstall the new application. Is there any way to configure VS 2015 to publish in a way that creates an regular install for all usersp

This is where the magic happens         events function start, end, callback                 Create an array to hold the events.             var events  []               Set the date from which to pull events based on the first visible day in the current calendar view. For a month view, this will usually be several days into the previous month. We can use FullCalendars builtin getView method along with the formatDate utility function to create a date string in the format that SharePoint requires. It must be in the format YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ. Due to time zone differences, we will omit everything after the day.         var startDate  moment.formatcalendar.fullCalendargetView.intervalstart, u.splitT[0]               Get the current view of the calendar agendaWeek, agendaDay, month, etc.. Then set the camlView to the appropriate value to pass to the web service. This way we will only retrieve events needed by the current view e.g. the agendaWeek view will only retrieve events during the current week rather than getting all events for the current month.             var calView   calendar .fullCalendar getView .title             var camlView                switch calView                   case agendaWeek                     camlView  ltWeek gt                     break                 case agendaDay                     camlView  ltWeek gt                     break                 default  Default to month view                     camlView  ltMonth gt                            Set the camlFields, camlQuery, and camlOptions to the appropriate values to pass to the web service. You can add additional ltViewFields gt or adjust the CAML query if you have some custom columns that you want to filter by or display data from.

FullCalendar will parse date strings in local time automagically, and we dont need to do any local time conversions for all day events, so we can use the UTC date strings from SharePoint without converting them to local time.                             var thisStart   this .attr owsEventDate                              var thisEnd   this .attr owsEndDate                                                   else                               Get the start and end datetime of the event. FullCalendar will parse date strings in local time automagically, so we need to convert the UTC date strings from SharePoint into local time. The formatDateToLocal function above will take care of this. See comments in that function for more information.                             var thisStart  formatDateToLocal  this .attr owsEventDate                               var thisEnd  formatDateToLocal  this .attr owsEndDate                                                      Get the list item ID and recurrence date if present. This will be used to generate the ID query string parameter to link to the event or the specific instance of a recurring event. The ID query string parameter must be in the format ID.0.yyyyMMddTHHmmssZ for recurring events where ID is the list item ID for the event. Event IDs are returned as just a number for nonrecurring events or several numbers separated by  in 2007 or . in 2010 to indicate individual instances of recurring events. By splitting and joining the ID this way, thisID will be set to a valid query string parameter whether an event is recurring or not for both versions of SharePoint.                         var thisID   this .attr owsID .split  .join .                            FullCalendar documentation specifies that recurring events should all have the same id value when building the events array the id is optional, but Im including it for completeness. We can get the list item ID which is the same for all instances of recurring events without the recurrence information by simply splitting thisID.                         var eventID  thisID.split . [0]                           Get the event title. This is displayed on the calendar along with the start time of the event.                         var thisTitle   this .attr owsTitle                            Get the event description. I dont use it in this example, but you could use it for something, perhaps as a tooltip when hovering over the event.                         var thisDesc   this .attr owsDescription                            Add the event information to the events array so FullCalendar can display it.                         events.push                             title thisTitle,                             id eventID,                             start thisStart,                             end thisEnd,                             allDay thisADE,                             color yellow,    a nonajax option                             textColor black,  a nonajax option                               Adjust this URL to link to the display form for your calendar events.
