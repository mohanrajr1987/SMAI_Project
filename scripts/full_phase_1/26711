Positive 26711 pThis is possibly a dumb question, but Im not seeing how the math works here. I have an image, 414w x 584h. To get an image scaled down to half this size i.e., half the initial width and height, using code[UIImage imageWithCGImagescaleFactororientation]code, I have to set codescaleFactorcode to 6.0.p  pWhy is it 6.0 How does this value relate to say, a width scale of 414207  2.0, or a height scale, same value, 584292  2.0p  pAs I write this, Im wondering... my app is running on an iPhone 6. So could it have something to do with the 3x Retina display I.e., normal scale factor of 2.0, which is dimensionless, but when applied to images on the 6, to get to pixels, I have to do 3x this Is this the logicp  pAnd, I guess, while Im here, is there a better way to resize an image, using available iOS facilities E.g., some special affine transform, etc. No particular concerns around memory or performance the images are all no more than 1000 wide by 1500 or so high.p  pThanks a lotp

Positive 26711 pI NOW  . In my current app  Im displaying an overlay of trails over an apple map. I was using MKOverlayView in my current app, which is, if not deprecated, not currently recommendedp  precodeII I want to  Use currently recommended technique with MKOverlayRenderer  and not use MKOverlayView         Im referring to apple doc Location and Maps Programming Guide  Displaying Overlays on a Map at this url  Also I think using these ideas will help me be able to pass different overlay names as parameters from a higher level in a more straightforward way  Ive been using ideas from, and attempting to understand this apple doc codepre  p       a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosdocumentationUserExperienceConceptualLocationAwarenessPGAnnotatingMapsAnnotatingMaps.htmlapplerefdocuidTP40009497CH6SW15 relnofollowhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosdocumentationUserExperienceConceptualLocationAwarenessPGAnnotatingMapsAnnotatingMaps.htmlapplerefdocuidTP40009497CH6SW15ap  precodeAt the bottom of posting are Other urls Ive investigated in connection, both within Stackoverflow and outside  MY CHALLENGE   When I follow ideas in the above apple doc, I see what to do if I render a regular overlay object, like a polygon my example code is based on that, but my overlay objects are UIImages They are not regular objects and also I dont draw them on the fly within the app.      I get quite confused when I read about what to do with custom overlays      According to the doc, Im need to subclass MKOverlayRenderer and implement  custom drawing code       My overlay is a fixed UIImage its not created on the fly within the app.       A It looks like I need to have two things happen in my custom overlay objects       1 A coordinate that defines the center point of the overlay      2 A bounding rectangle that completely encompasses the overlays content, specified in map points And I can use Map Kit functions to convert from my coordinate based data to map points       B Also I have to define a custom overlay renderer   III I HAVE created a  sample app miniOverlay which uses ideas in the apple doc to draw a polygon around the apple map region Im working with in my real world app. Of course in my real app, Im not interested in rendering regular objects as overlays. I actually want to draw overlays which Im including as fixed UIImages in my app.   I started with the polygon example, so that I can make sure I understand how to render some kind of overlay without using MKOverlayView  which is what I use in my current app, and want to stop using.   I have included code in miniOverlay that isnt yet rendering my trails overlay, working to go in the right direction. Note that the polygon drawing example  which is included there too  does work. It draws a polygon in an area above the map region I define.

Positive 26711 pI have an app that has a image crop view. The user can draw a path and then the path is masked out of the image, and a new image is saved using ImageContext.

If you crop a section on the far left side of the image then mirroring the image with make it jump position dramatically. So I need to either cut the image way down after crop to only the cropped section, or reset the pivot to the center of the cropped portion.

Positive 26711 pIm a fairly experienced iOS developer but a total SceneKit newbie, trying to simulate some planets in a basic app.p  pTo that end, Im using highres normal and diffuse maps of Mars, Venus, etc, applied to basic spheres.

The app needs to be able to zoom at least to where the planet is screenwidth, but to maintain any crispness in the mountains and valleys I need to use a PNG normal map above at about 6000 x 3000.  I can scale the diffuse map way down to about 1000 x 500, but even so, strongIm getting periodic memory crashes from a single sphere gently rotating, with a single light, no background, no physics, and no other geometry.strongp  pNow, emI knowem thats a superhighres normal map.  I get it.  But at the same time, its just one sphere, doing nothing.  Thats not even close to some of the complexity Ive seen other apps execute flawlessly, even with some pretty detailed textures of their own.  It seems like there must be some way of getting highdetail surface textures for a single object, without crashing the app.p  pSo, being a total SceneKit newbie, Im wondering strongare there any tricks for getting good SceneKit texture quality without using ALL the memory in the worldstrong  Maybe a way of handling the image textures, reencoding the files, changing the scenenode settings, etc  Any way at all to get crisp quality with smaller images, or lower memory usage with the same imagesp  pId happily quote some code, but right now there isnt much to show.  I apply the textures to the SceneKit node the standard way, and it works.  Im just dying from either a lack of memory, or lack of image quality.p  pCan anyone help me outp

So, I decided I could get the same result by modifying the above query by using ORDER BY badgecount DESC LIMIT 1, which returns an array of a single element, whose value is the highest count total of all the events.p  pWhile this solution works well for me, Im curious if it is taking more resources to make 2 calls to the server bc Im now using two queries instead of working it out in php.

Negative 26711 pSorry for the long post that follows.p  pI know that it is not a good idea to mix the statically linked and dynamically linked C and C runtimes supplied by Microsoft. Our application at work already mixes them unfortunately and weve been trying to fix that. For various reasons among which unfamiliarity with MSI, the fact that we use NSIS which maybe doesnt support MSMs well, lack of time and resources we decided to link the CRTs statically instead of dynamically. I know the reasons why this is not a good idea but it was our choice for now.p  phr p  pOur code is mostly standard C complemented by quite a lot of other opensource libraries.p  pThe structure of the application is various modules that result in static libraries which themselves are linked together to create various stuff among which one executable that is giving us problems.p  pIn Release we build all strongourstrong code with MT. For some of the opensource libraries we used precompiled binaries and some of them were dlls precompiled with MD which made us mix the runtimes. So we recompiled those ourselves with MT and made them result in static libraries not dlls. This conversion is not done for each library, so we still link with some dlls that use MD.p  phr p  pThe result now is that in depends.exe all of our stuff strongexcept one executablestrong doesnt strongdirectlystrong depend on msvcr80.dll or msvcp80.dll. By strongdoesnt directly dependstrong I mean that msvcr80.dll is not a child of the root of the tree shown by depends.exe. Sometimes we do find msvcr80.dll pulled in by one of the library dlls but thats some levels deeper in the tree.p  pHow do I find out why is msvcr80.dll on the first level for that one pesky executable What makes that executable link directly to msvcr80.dllp  pOne reason could maybe be that we link statically to library A which links uses MD so it links dynamically with the CRT. So the code in library A ends up in our executable so our executable links with msvcr80.dll. But how do I find out which one of the libraries does thatp  phr p  pWhat I tried so farp  ul liload the statically linked .lib files in depends.exe  doesnt work since depends.exe expects an executable or dll not a static libraryli liuse dumpbin.exe DIRECTIVES on the statically linked .lib files  none of them showed msvcrt80.dll while in Debug, where we try to use MDd for everything, they did show msvcrt80d.dll which makes me think the method is good and it proves that all the statically linked opensource libraries are compiled correctly with MTli liuse the VERBOSELIB linker flag  it showed that indeed its pulling in msvcrt.lib which is the import library for msvcr80.dll so were in trouble but it didnt say why its doing thatli liuse the VERBOSE linker flag  in Visual Studio Additional Dependencies libcmt.lib  Ignore all default libraries YES  Ignore specific library msvcrt.lib in a desperate attempt to make msvcrt.lib go away or see who pulls it it.

Negative 26711 pI have a lot of images taken from a 360 camera which I would like to be able to display in Silverlight 3. They are NOT regular panorama images.

Negative 26711 pI written an exception handler routine that helps us catch problems with our software. I usep  precodeSetUnhandledExceptionFilter codepre  pto catch any uncaught exceptions, and it works very well.p  pHowever my handler pops up a dialog asking the user to detail what they were doing at the time of the crash. This is where the problem comes, because the dialog is in the same thread context as the crash, the dialog continues to pump the messages of application. This causes me a problem, as one of our crashes is in a WMTIMER, which goes off every minute. As you can imagine if the dialog has been on the screen for over a minute, a WMTIMER is dispatched and the app recrashes. Reentering the exception handler under this situation is bad news.p  pIf I let Windows handle the crash, Windows displays a dialog that appears to function, but stops the messages propagating to the rest of the application, hence the WMTIMER does not get reissued.p  pDoes anyone know how I can achieve the same effectp  pThanks Richp

Negative 26711 pSummaryp  pIf you use ASP.NET MVC 2s templates to render a DropDownList, how would you access the list of options if they are stored in the top level Views Model.property  Also, is there some [DataAnnotation] way to associate this list  Links to examples would be very helpful.p  pBackgroundp  pIn ASP.NET MVC 2, you can create a custom class like codeStateNamecode and use an EditorTemplate called codeStateName.ascxcode, which will display that partial view anytime it finds a codeStateNamecode property.  Brad Wilson has a great writeup a hrefhttpbradwilson.typepad.comblog200910aspnetmvc2templatespart1introduction.html relnofollowherea describing it.  These partial view templates can be nested so that each template only deals with its own scope matching the templates scope to the matching POCOs properties.p  pSetupp  pNow imagine that the codeStateName.ascxcode renders a DropDownList and needs the list of possible states [AL,Alabama,PA,Pennsylvania,...].  Generally, the top level View Model has all we need to render both the DomainModel like our ShoppingCart, and any miscellaneous data like lists for drop downs.p  pQuestionp  pstrongSo, the question is how does a partial view template codeStateName.ascxcode reference the nonpartial top level views Model property codeIListltStateNamegt Statescode to populate the DDL in the partial view templatestrong especially if you have several nested or codedeep divecode renderings like Model.Customer[0].BillingAddress.State, the templates parent view may not be the top level view.  p  pAnother angle may be to put some sort of [Data Annotation] on the class property that associates this list of possible states to the partial view templates Modelp  pFor example, heres the top level Views Modelp  precodeModel.ShoppingCart.Customer.ShippingAddress Model.ShoppingCart.Customer.BillingAddress Model.StateNames          IListltStateNamegt Model.MaritalStatusNames  IListltMaritalStatusgt Model.GenderNames         IListltGendergt codepre  pFurthermore we could make all DDL data lists in one property, like codeModel.DDLs.StateNamescode, codeModel.DDLs.GenderNamescode, etc.p

Negative 26711 pSo, I have an XML file I am using with dbUnit as a data source, and it has some dates in it.  The date in the file is like so 20100204, but once it gets loaded and I access it to print or compare in tests, it thinks the date is 20100203 2300.p  pIm guessing this has to do with EDTEST, but Im not sure how I can force dbUnit or possibly hibernate to use the correct timezone.p  pDoes anyone have any experience with dbUnit and dates  p  pThanks, Peterp  pstrongEDITstrongbr Okay, Im pretty sure, for some reason, its reading the date in as EDT, which is correct, then storing it as EST, which is not technically correct we are EDT here, but is correct per my computer which says its EST.  This conversion is causing the date to lose an hour.  Not sure why Java thinks we are EST Windows XP knows were not, and am doubly unsure why dbUnit thinks the date should be EDT, since it, like Java, should probably be reading the incorrect timezone as EST.  This is pretty confusing.p  pstrongEDITstrong I took the Hibernate XML out because thats not the problem.  After more poking around, here is what is happening 1. dbUnit reads the date as a String from the source XML and converts it to a java.sql.Date.  By nature, these do not store hoursminutesseconds, but when you look at the millis, its clearly adjusted by 4 hours worth in order to show that, though its midnight here in EDT, its 4am in UTC.  Also, this is backed by a Calendar, which has a timezone that is labeled AmericaNew York or something equivalent.  I cant exactly remember. 2. Whenever I print this date, my system, which thinks its EST reconverts 4am UTC to 11pm the previous day, which would be correct, except were not in EST. 3. Whenever I create a date myself for testing as the example, since my JVM believe were in EST, it adds strongemfiveemstrong hours worth of millis to make the difference between it and UTC.  Clearly, these are different dates, and it fails.p  pSo, the real question is, twofold, I guess 1. Why does my console think its EST  My Windows XP settings are correct as far as I know.  I understand there used to be a problem in Java 1.4 that got the wrong TZ, but I think this has been since fixed and I am running supposedly 1.6. 2. Why does dbUnit, which is in the same JVM using the proper fancy TZ.p  pI suppose I could stop using dates all together, but I dont necessarily have that luxury.p

Negative 26711 pI was reading about a hrefhttpcodebutler.comfiresheep relnofollowFiresheepa and wondering how I can protect my Spring MVC 3.0 site against attacks like thisp  blockquote   pIts extremely common for websites to   protect your password by encrypting   the initial login, but surprisingly   uncommon for websites to encrypt   everything else. This leaves the   cookie and the user vulnerable. HTTP   session hijacking sometimes called   sidejacking is when an attacker   gets a hold of a users cookie,   allowing them to do anything the user   can do on a particular website. On an   open wireless network, cookies are   basically shouted through the air,   making these attacks extremely easy.p blockquote  pAre there particular configuration settings in Spring MVC that could help protect against this kind of attackp  pAccording to the articlep  blockquote   pThe only effective fix for this   problem is full endtoend encryption,   known on the web as HTTPS or SSL.p blockquote  pstrongI have a Spring site that Im running on Google App Engine.

Negative 26711 pIm needing to produce a checksum for a bunch of data in Perl, and I came across this DigestMD5 module.  It looks like it will fit the bill, but I thought I would ask here to see if anyone has any advise or possibly knows of a better module to use or even maybe a more suitable digest algorithm.  Whats being hashed is about 10 tables worth of data one logical tuple at a time.  This will be the first time I make use of checksums, so any tips, tricks, gotchas would be very appreciated.p  pEdit  As far as I know, theres nothing wrong with DigestMD5, but Ive never used it nor am I familiar with hash algorithms.  I was hoping someone with experience would be able to tell me if I was on the right track or not.  Just wanted a little bit of confirmation before going too far.p

Negative 26711 pI have data in sharepoint which has 104 columns and 708 rows. This data is basically contains information about enterprise.

For instance grouping of applications by criticality in a pie chart.p  pIn order to create these n number of reports what we thought is to transfer the sharepoint list to sql server using SSIS and then use sql server reporting services SSRS to generate those reports and then use an ASP .net front end to contain the reports.p  pThe very first important question is whether we can transfer sharepoint list to SQL Server using SSIS.

Negative 26711 pI have been doing some digging lately, and I am trying to see what the best approach is to track memory usage in real time software that is always running on Linux in this case on a bunch of nodes, using MPI. Since there is no endcondition for the code, I want to be able to track the memory usage in real time, to see which MPI image is using the most, which functions are using the most, how much each node is using, and how much the entire executable is using across the entire system.p  pAre there tools already out there for such a thing It seems like most things I find are profilers that give results after the fact. Hopefully the answer will be able to track the memory usage of my software, and 3rd party libs my software is using, which I have no access to source code.p
Negative 26711 pOne of our sites that we want to use google analytics on is hosted inside our network.p  pWe would like to exclude the administrators own traffic from the reports, but I am wandering how analytics obtains the users IP address. p  pIf it uses the address which the analytics script is requested from the HTTP request for the js then it will see one of our external ips and excluding that will get rid of all traffic.p  pIf it obtains it in javascript once the ga.js is downloaded then it will see the internal 10.x.x.x addresses and filtering out the assigned addresses will have the desired result.p  pEssentially my question is, will filtering the internal address work or not.p  pI shall set up an experiment now, but obviously it will take 1 or 2 days before I can be sure about that outcome. If it doesnt work, then I will set custom vars and filter those insteadp

Negative 26711 pI am attempting to improve the portability of a bit of code by automatically detecting what values populate the rel attribute of a set of links so that I can create multiple image lightboxes on a page. Basically, right now I am pulling data about hotels from a database, and for each hotel I find I am creating a simple image gallery that consists of a JCarousel, and for each JCarousel the images are able to be clicked launching a lightbox containing only images from that set. Here is the code I currently use to accomplish my goal right nowp  precodedocument.readyfunction     .carousel.jcarousel         wrap circular,         visible 3,         scroll 1          a.lightbox[rel9].lightBox     a.lightbox[rel10].lightBox     a.lightbox[rel11].lightBox     a.lightbox[rel13].lightBox  codepre  pThe problem with the current approach is that if someone else adds a hotel to the database which will always be the case the images will appear within the carousel, but will not have the lightbox effect unless I manually add it.

Negative 26711 pIm working through a hrefhttpcode.google.comedulanguagesgooglepythonclassindex.html relnofollowGoogles Python class exercisesa. One of the exercises is this p  pGiven two lists sorted in increasing order, create and return a merged list of all the elements in sorted order. You may modify the passed in lists. Ideally, the solution should work in linear time, making a single pass of both lists.p  pThe solution I came up with wasp  precode    def linearmergelist1, list2       list1.extendlist2        return sortedlist1 codepre  pIt passed the the test function, but the solution given is thisp  precode    def linearmergelist1, list2       result  []        Look at the two lists so long as both are nonempty.        Take whichever element [0] is smaller.       while lenlist1 and lenlist2         if list1[0] lt list2[0]           result.appendlist1.pop0          else           result.appendlist2.pop0         Now tack on whats left       result.extendlist1       result.extendlist2       return result codepre  pIncluded as part of the solution was thisp  pNote the solution above is kind of cute, but unfortunately list.pop0 is  not constant time with the standard python list implementation, so the  above is not strictly linear time. An alternate approach uses pop1 to  remove the endmost elements from each list, building a solution list which is backwards. Then use reversed to put the result back in the correct  order. That solution works in linear time, but is more ugly.p  pWhy are these two solutions so different Am I missing something, or are they being unnecessarily complicatedp

Negative 26711 pEarlier today, as I was coding a method and it struck me that I wasnt sure exactly why the idiom I was implementing compiles.  If everything else is abstracted away, it would look something like thisp  precode    private int Example              while true                      if some condition                             return 1                            codepre  pYou have an explicitly infinite loop, and some set of conditions inside the loop that cause the loop to end with a return statement.  Lets ignore for the time being why I was doing this as opposed to checking for a termination condition in the while clause as the answer is convoluted and irrelevant  what I want to know is why the compiler doesnt flag this with a Not all paths return a value. error, as, strictly speaking not all paths do return a value.  The case in which the while loop is never entered which, of course, never happens doesnt return anything.p  pNow, there are two reasons I can imagine it happening this is a side effect of optimization thats occurring for other reasons, or this case is explicitly being handled by the compiler to allow this idiom.  My instinct is that its probably the first case.  It doesnt surprise me at all, for instance, that this compilesp  precodeprivate int Example2     if true return 1  codepre  pBecause the compiler sees a constant true in the if, and optimizes the conditional away.

Negative 26711 blockquote   pNote on Facebooks secure cookie formatp      pIn their new secure cookie format, Facebook provides an OAuth code, which Koala   automatically exchanges for an access token. Because this involves   a call to Facebooks            servers, you should consider storing the users access token in their        session and only            calling getuserinfofromcookies when necessary accesstoken not present, you discover            its expired, etc.. Otherwise, youll be calling out to Facebook        each time the user loads a            page, slowing down your site. As we figure out best practices for this, well update this            wiki.p blockquote  pLet me get this straight even if I use the Javascript SDK to parse the cookies I still need to do a servertoserver call to facebook Doesnt this make the whole java script SDK for user authentication kind of useless I always need to check the cookies so I wont have a stale access token thus calling facebook every timep

Negative 26711 pIve been working on a text editor for some time. I made a custom edit control, from scratch, and Ive got the basics down now. The problem I am facing is regarding line management. Since, my program relies on dividing the input text into linesthe text is printed line by line, line management is pretty important. I was using stdvector to store the line positions. I am using a Piece Table for my text processing, but for the sake of simplicity, lets say that I have an array of characters. I addinsert an element into the line vector every time the user presses enter. The issue is that every time the user inserts a character, the whole structure is disturbed. For example  p  precode         0   1   2   3   4   5    6   7   8   9   10 text  [h,e,l,l,o,n,W,o,r,l,d] state of line vector   line[0]  0  line[1]  6 codepre  pLets say the user inserts a characterx after the  text[2]p  precode         0   1   2   3   4   5    6   7   8   9   10  11 text  [h,e,l,x,l,o,n,W,o,r,l,d]  state of line vector   line[0]  0  line[1]  6 codepre  pBecause of the insertion, I would need to update the value of each element in the lines vector after the current line. The same for deletion. If there are 1000 lines in a program and the user edits the first line, it would be quite inefficient to update all 999 elementsexcept the first one. p  pWhat I was thinking of was to keep each line independent of each other. But that would lead to complications when an existing line is divided into two lines. So Id like to know whats a good way to go about the problemp  pEdit  Just to clarify, I am using a data structure called Piece Table. I am not using an array of characters.

Negative 26711 pI would like some advice on the difficulties one would have in order to run a website which is partially written in Ruby On Rails and partially written in a .NET language C, in my case. It may sound crazy to want to do this, but the current scenario in the company I work for may require me to create such a setup.br The situation is that we may acquire a system that is written in RoR, while our inhouse system is entirely written in C. The system to be acquired is reasonably complex and would not only save me and the other developer many hours of work, but would also serve the company a school before march, when classes begin. Please understand that not acquiring this system would probably mean a whole year without it, as many of the internal procedures of this school would have to rely on this system from the beginning and this is the greatest reason why we are considering acquiring it now.br So now I am responsible for raising all the difficulties I may have in order to integrate these systems. My initial idea is to run the .NET system on IIS as it is right now and the RoR system on apache or nginx, listening on another port, of course. The UIs to both systems would be identical and would have to integrate seamlessly from the user point of view links would point to the same domain on another port, but that would be fine. It probably is important to mention that we are using SQL Server as our DB. It may be helpful that I have decent Linux knowledge and experience it is my personal system of choice.br So far, the technical difficulties I have thought of are  p  ol liA common cookiesessionauth cookie pool such as a memcached server so that we dont force users to login twice when accessing the different systems.li liSwitch the DB to postgresql or mysql please, Ruby community, enlighten me in case Ruby doesnt play well with SQL Server. I have heard rumors that this new system uses ActiveRecord to access the DB. Switching to postgresql is, either way, in the list of future changes, as it is my preferred DB.li liTaking this system online. This would obviously require a VPS instead of a simple hosting service which is what we currently have and would greatly increase the burden on the IT department me and one more person.li liPossible problems of running RoR on Windows. This could mean a change to Linux  Mono for .NET and postgresql mono running our systems wouldnt be a problem, Im sure. This is however, a huge change, and it may scare my boss and myself a bit at first.li ol  pThere are many other much more administrative problems, such as future maintenance and extensions would mean that I would either have to learn RoR and a bunch of other technologies which, I must say, I would enjoy, but still.. or that we would have to pay more to have it maintained by this module original developers.  p  pWhat I ask of you is what other problems do you see coming I will have a technical meeting with the developers of this system monday and I would like to get there prepared to discuss these problems. I need to inform my boss of the problems ahead as well, of course.p

This quiz project contains two main SQL Databases it pulls the info from. p  pFirst is a Quiz table, which contains three columns  QuizID Pri Key, Title, Description.  This is where I declare the quizzes, indicated by the QuizID 1, 2, 3....etcp  pThe second table is the Questions table, containing the following columns  QuestionsID Pri Key, Title, Answer1, Answer2, Answer3, Answer4, Answer5, CorrectAnswer, QuestionOrder, QuizIDp  pThe QuizID in the Quesitons table matches the QuizID in the Quiz table.  Thus for QuizID  1, it consists of all the questions with the matching QuizID in the Questions table. The CorrectAnswer I want to assign a simple value 1, 2, 3...etc.p  pI need a way to take a set of questions based on the QuizID put them in some sort of table and randomize them or rather shuffle them so that each time this quiz is taken, it pulls all questions randomly, but not repeating anyp  pI then want the code to pull the question and coorepsonding answers to pick from in a radiobuttonlist.  However, It only needs to pull the number of answers.  Example, a TrueFalse will only have Answer1 and Answer2.  The other Answers will have the NULL value in it.  p  pThere needs to then be a way to go through each one of these questions that have been placed in the table in that random order using a next button.  When a question and possible answwers are displayed, I alaready have code to keep the answers in the session to grade it at the end using correctAnswer and selected answer.p  pI have no specific way to bind the data to the Database.  I have used SQLDataSource to make other connections before, but I dont know if this is the best way.p  pThanks in advance for any advice.

Negative 26711 pI was reading Programming Pearls and I am really confused in one of the solution explanationsproblem 9 in column 1.p  pThe question was When using bitmap data to represent a set of integers, the first phase initializes the set to empty. But initializing the space can itself take a great deal of time. Show how to circumvent this problem by designing a technique to initialize an entry of a vector to zero the first time it is accessed.p  pThe answer was   The effect of initializing the vector emdataem[0...n1] can be accomplished with a signature  contained in two additional nelement vectors, emfromem and emtoem, and an integer emtopem. If the element emdataem[i] has been initialized, then emfromem[i] lt emtopem and emtoem[from[i]]  i. Thus emfromem is a simple  signature, and emtoem and emtopem together make sure that emfromem is not accidentally signed by the random contents of memory.  p  pI have read this answer several times. I dont understand it.p  pCan someone explain itp  pThanks,p

I can manage that by customizing the Secure.java class and the route file of the Secure module. But is it a correct method to do that.    I have one more query regrading the check method. According to the documentation, we need to override the check method in the Security class which is extended from Secure.Security in order to check the users profile. I had done the same i.e. added the check annotation Checkadmin in the Admin controller and override the method in the Security class. But the check method overridden method is never called. why this is so Am I getting something wrong herep  pHere  is the structure of the Admin class...p  precodeWithSecure.class Checkadmin public class Admin extends JapidContorller         An action to render the index page of the Back end admin module.      public static void index      renderJapid            An action to render the login page of the Back end admin module.        public static void adminLogin        renderJapid            An method to log out the logged in user.        public static void adminLogout       renderJapid       codepre  pAnd in Security classp  precodepublic class Security extends Secure.Security      public static boolean authenticateString username, String password                         public static boolean checkString profile        System.out.println[Security]  The check from security is called        return true       codepre  pBut here the check is never called when I request the Admin.index page. So here I need uyour help on two different issue. 1  If the application is having more than one login page, then how should we handle the users authentication using secure module. 2 The overridden check method is never called.p  pPlease help me here. Its really urgent.p

Negative 26711 pIve used a couple of days to think of a best practice to generate a PDF, which end users can customize the layout for themselves. The PDF output needs to be saved on the server or sent back to the PHP file so the PHP file can save it, and the PHP file needs to know that it went OK. p  pI thought the best way to do this was to use XML, XSLT and Apache Cocoon. But Im not sure if this is possible or if its a good idea since I cant find any information of people doing anything similar. It cannot be an uncommon problem. p  pThe idea came when I read about Cocoon converting XML through XSLT to PDF p  pa hrefhttpcocoon.apache.org2.1howtohowtohtmlpdfpublishing.html relnofollowhttpcocoon.apache.org2.1howtohowtohtmlpdfpublishing.htmlap  pand being able to take in variablesp  pa hrefhttpold.nabble.comhowtoaccesspostparametersfromsitemaptd31478752.html relnofollowhttpold.nabble.comhowtoaccesspostparametersfromsitemaptd31478752.htmlap  pThis is what I had in mindp  ol liA php file gets called by a user, the php file generates a source XML file with a specific nameli liThe php file then makes a request to Cocoon on the same web server to apply the user defined XSLT on the XML file. A parameter will be needed here to know which XSLT to apply. li liThe request is handled by the PHP file and then saved as a PDF on the server, and can later be mailed away. li ol  pWill this work at all Is there a better way to handle thisp  pThe core problem is that the users need to be able to customize the layout on the PDFs themselves, and I need the server to save the PDF and to mail it later on. The users will use it for order confirmations, invoices, etc. And I wouldnt like to hard code the layout for each user.p

Negative 26711 pCurrently, I am writing a MiddleWare application that synchronizes information between and accounting application i.e. Quickbooks and a SQL database.  I am fairly new to LinqToSQL and am currently struggling with what originally appeared to be a simple problem.p  pIn short, I have logic that queries the chart of accounts from the accounting application i.e. AR, Income, Expense, Liability, etc....  Then, my Middleware has to determine whether or not it needs to insert, update, or delete an account in the Accounts table of the SQL database for each record.  Figuring out whether or not the operation is insert or delete was pretty easy to figure out but, I am struggling with the case where an account is deleted from Quickbooks and needs to be deleted from my SQL database.  Id like to run a LinqToSql query that basically deletes all records from the Account table where the ListID is not in the list of ListIDs retrieved from a query.  Is there some easy way to perform this in LinqToSqlp

So, these tasks are not very longlived, they just need to execute at some point in the future. Normal worker threads will do traditional blockingIO to perform their work, and are generally more longlived.p  pA related question is it better to do delayed tasks in an explicit, single thread instead of using the codeschedulecode method That is, have a loop like thisp  precodeDelayedQueueltSomeTaskClassgt tasks  ... while true      taskltSomeTaskClassgt  tasks.take     threadpool.submittask  codepre  pDoes DelayQueue use any worker threads to implement its functionality I was going to just experiment with it today, but advice would be well appreciated.p

Negative 26711 pI posted the implementation and short testdemo here a hrefhttpideone.comCNJDi relnofollowhttpideone.comCNJDiap  pI came up with an approach to C Delegates that is way different than other stuff Ive been seeing. The problem specifically that I want to solve is to have a unified function pointer solution where a given instance may be either a member fn ptrobject ptr or b a nonmember fn ptr. Once you initialize the delegate and hand it off to other code, he can just call it, dynamically, without even knowing what type of object it came from normally member function pointers can only be invoked by statically referencing the class it came from. Boo. Its readily possible in theory, but C makes it extra hard to pull off anything like this. So I twisted the language to make it work.p  pThe main drawback of my implementation is that it is not technically standards compliant due to invalid castsinvocations of member function pointers at least, Im 95 sure the standard is not protecting me here.... But it emdoesem happen to work on the compilers I tested it on including Visual Studio 2012. I also think its clear that it would tend to work if member functions are implemented in a straightforward way by the compiler.p  pI looked at some other implementations but to me they just seemed so complicated and clumsy to use. Some even relied on build tools to generate stub functions to call the member functions, whereas mine only relies only on macros and templates. I think the lack of proper delegates is a major shortcoming of C, but I find that I hate this workaround less. Now I need to decide if I actually want to use it, or if I only like it because I thought of it.p  pHere is how you use itp  pA. Declare Delegate typep  precodetypedef DELEGATEfloat, ARGSint, int Delegate1 codepre  pThis macro automatically declares the static and member function pointer types so you dont have to type the signature twice. It expands to codeDelegateltfloat int, int, float Nullint, intgtcode. The compiler uses whichever of these is appropriate depending on how the delegate instance was initialized to perform invocations later. And the compiler uses it to statically validate arguments supplied by the coders invocations. The ARGS macro is pure syntactic sugar to separate from the return type DELEGATEfloat, int, int is the same.p  pB. Initializep  precodeDelegate1 d  Delegate1test1  static function Delegate1 e  Delegate1Delegate1MemberTypeampTestClasstest2, ampobj  member codepre  pthese static and member functions are now stored as the same type obj must be a valid pointer to a TestClass instance, and TestClasstest2 had better return a float and take int, int as arguments as described above. This is the main usage pitfall, the compiler cant catch mistakes made here.p  pC. Invoke codeINVOKEd, ARGS5, 6code  returns a float in this example Despite its appearance, this argument list is as actually as type safe as any C function call It verifies the arguments using the aforementioned float int, int signature supplied above It can support any number of arguments, it just has to match the signature. You get the friendly compiler error if you add too manytoo few arguments, use the wrong argument types, etc. from the compiler. Again, ARGS is syntactic sugar, codeINVOKEd, 5, 6code is the same.p  pBut if used INVOKE in a compiler that does not approve, it would probably crash the program p  pI have several questionsp  ol liCan anyone find any good compilers that my posted implementation sample does not work correctly on li liI hope this either works completely or the compilerprogram flips out on the first usage. But is there a possibility of it seeming to work for a while and then randomly crashingli liDoes this seem easyclean to use in your opinion Or do you find other implementations simpler Which ones Can you think of a good way to improve my syntaxuseability of mine somehowli liWould you ever use it Or should I just bite the bullet and use a safer but more complex alternative solutionli ol

Negative 26711 pI have a very large tsv file and need to delete several columns. Ive found the CSV module, and an answer as below to a sort of similar question see script below. Yet I need to delete a large range of columns and dont want to type every single index of each column to delete. Ie from a file with 689513 columns, Id like to remove columns 628715 through 650181 and also to remove columns 653321 to 689513. If its too hard to remove both sets, I can just go with removing the last ones only, ie, 653321 through 689613, or equivalently 653321 to the end of the file. Sorry for the basic question Im new to scripting and getting lost ... and the CSV module page doesnt go into detail on deleting column ranges. I tried doing this in R but the first cell entry is blank see sample list below code. My file is a tsv tab delimited file, but I gather that can be rectified using a command to set the delimiter as t. Any help is greatly appreciated Note unfortunately I need to have colons in the names of my columns, ie 2L1274 is a altogether the name for one column.p  precodeimport csv with opensource,rb as source rdr csv.reader source  with openresult,wb as result     wtr csv.writer result      for r in rdr         wtr.writerow r[0], r[1], r[3], r[4]   2L1274 2L2425 2L2853 3L4    3L5    3L7 indivBCsusceptiblePL7A10TATAGT NA  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA indivBCsusceptiblePL7A11CCTGAA NA  5   NA  NA  NA  NA indivBCsusceptiblePL7A12CAATAT NA  NA  6   7   8   9 indivBCsusceptiblePL7A1CCGAAT  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA codepre

Negative 26711 pI am making a media player, now.. I have added a realtime search function to search for songs etc. Some thing like WMP realtime search i.e while you enter the keywords the searching happens.p  pDuring the searching process, accessing the database and loading an IEnumerable is done on another thread via a BackGroundProcess. The UI is updated by invoking a dispatcher of a UIElement.p  pThis process is rather fast, but however while you enter the search keywords in the textbox, there seems to be a small lag, this is beacause the Listbox.ItemSource updating takes some time.  i.e say you want to search for Adele, when you type in a, the search function loads the results for A, but as we are typing the whole word Adele , it some time to display the d e l e and there is a slight lag in between these letters.p  pDuring this search process, when I stop updating the UI the search process seems very smooth, this only means to me that the Listbox is locking up the thread, so the rest of the players UI is stuck there while the Listbox is done with its processing.p  pSo I believe if I can put the Listbox Control to another UI thread, I can maintain the smooth flow of the player irrespective of the time taken to load the Listbox. FYI Data Virutualization is there amp ListBox has UI Virtualization is workingp  pHow can i put the ListBox control onto another UI Thread WPF, Cp  pThanks in advance  p

Negative 26711 pIm working on a CakePHP 1.3 project in a LAMP environment in which we store a number of videos outside of codeappwebrootcode and serve them up using a hrefhttpbook.cakephp.org1.3view1094MediaViews relnofollowCakePHPs Media Viewsa we do this as we dont want the files directly accessible.  However, Im having trouble serving these videos up to iOS devices e.g., iPhone, iPad via Media Views.p  pI can place my test video somewhere within codeappwebrootcode and access it directly on an iOS device and playback works as expected, so Im pretty sure its not a MOOV problem or another encoding issue with the video itself.  As far as I can tell, its got something to do with CakePHPs handling or lack thereof of byterange requests that iOS devices use when loading video.p  pI found a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11050528usingcakephpsmediaviewwithmp4videosonanipadone other Stack Overflow ticketa that has unfortunately gone unanswered, but details a similar problem.  Looking at the codecakelibsviewmedia.phpcode class file, there is an if statement within the coderendercode method that is cued on a check for a codeSERVER[HTTPRANGE]code value but as far as I can tell in testing, this value is never being set at least not when CakePHP looks for it.  The offsite solution linked in the aforementioned ticket doesnt solve my problem as it too relies on a check of this value, which Ive verified is not being found when checked for either in the Media View class itself, or in the controller thats setting up said view.p  pSo, has anyone had any luck or experience serving videos up to iOS devices using CakePHP Media Views  Thanks in advancep

Recently, I used it with a function that takes lists as arguments, and apparently making keys with whole lists slowed everything down. What is the best way to do that i.e., to efficiently compute keys, whatever the args, and however long or complex they arep  pI guess the question is really about how you would efficiently produce keys from the args and the function for a generic memoizer  I have observed in one program that poor keys too expensive to produce had a significant impact on the runtime. My prog was taking 45s with strargs, but I could reduce that to 3s with handcrafted keys. Unfortunately, the handcrafted keys are specific to this prog, but I want a fast memoizer where I wont have to roll out specific, handcrafted keys for the cache each time. p

Negative 26711 pSo Im currently working on adding a recommendation engine to a Django project and need to do some heavy processing in an external module for one of my view functions. This significantly slows down page load time because I have to load in some data, transform it, perform my calculations based on parameters sent by the request, and then return the suggestions to the view. This has to be done every time the view is loaded.p  pI was wondering if there was some way I could have the recommender module load and transform the data in memory, and then wait for parameters to be sent from the view, have calculations run on those parameters and then send it back to the view. p  pAny help would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 26711 pLets say that I have the following very simple CRTP base classp  precodetemplatelt class D, class T gt struct Base       T foo                  return staticcastlt D gtthisgtfooi        codepre  pAnd also, a handful of deriving classes. Everything works well, but there is a problem theres emoneem particular situation or perhaps a couple where I would emreally, reallyem like two of the classes to have runtime polymorphic behaviour need to put them in containers. In other words, Id like some of the deriving CRTP classes to have virtual versions as well. So, I came up with the following classp  precodetemplatelt class T gt struct VirtualBase  public Baselt VirtualBaselt T gt, T gt       virtual T fooi  0   codepre  pNow, where I need runtime polymorphism, I just derive from this class. Lets say that I want my derived class codeDerivedBcode to have a virtual version. The vanilla DerivedB looks like this p  precodetemplatelt class T gt struct DerivedB  public Baselt DerivedBlt T gt, T gt       T fooi                stdcout ltlt Im specialn         return T         codepre  pWhat I would like to do is essentially to add an extra template parameter to this class so that I can at compiletime select whether I derive from Base if I want simulated dynamic binding or VirtualBase if I want real dynamic binding. Something like the following pseudoCp  precodetemplatelt class B, class T gt struct DerivedB  public Blt DerivedBlt T gt, T gt       T fooi                stdcout ltlt Im specialn         return T         codepre  pSo for plain CRTP, pass codeBasecode as codeBcode and for a virtual class, pass codeVirtualBasecode as codeBcode. The problem, of course, is that they take a different number of arguments codeBasecode needs the type of the deriving class, and I cannot come up with a working solution.p  pSo, how would I select the base class at compiletime Or, if this too complicatedimpossible, what would be the easiest way to have static CRTP and dynamic virtual versions of a class, where otherwise the implementation is identicalp

Negative 26711 pIm using RavenDB on a project that is currently in development so has no users yet. My background has always been relational databases until this project but I much prefer the NoSQL approach in general. However, I dont yet have any experience of working on or managing a site built atop a NoSQL database that gets heavy traffic. Im starting to get an understanding of MapReduce indexes and have included some within my solution but am wonderingp  pstrongAre there any design rules of thumb that I should be following about when to create MapReduce indexes and when not tostrong p  pI know that it is very dependent upon the business objects I have in my system and how they interact with each other. I guess Im just struggling to see the big picture about which queries I might be making that should use an index, and which I can simply query the objects for directly. p  pHeres a quick overview of parts of my business domain and where Ive created indexes alreadyp  pMy system consists primarily of brands and consumers. Each of those has many social media accounts. When a user signs in via their social media account, I have indexes, codeBrandsBySocialAccountcode and codeConsumersBySocialAccountcode, which flatten those collections and associate them with the codeUserIdcode of the brand or consumer. Once I have the codeUserIdcode I can then retrieve the relevant brand or consumer record and away I go. p  pA brand can create many campaigns. I have another index here, codeCampaignsByBrandcode. Theres also a requirement for tracking how consumers interact with campaigns, so campaigns can have many tracking entries for the different interactions they can perform with a campaign. They can follow a link to a campaign page externally or discover one from within the site itself for example. As I explain this it seems clear that I need indexes here. Either I have an index per interaction codeClickLinkTrackingEntriesByCampaigncode and codeViewDetailsTrackingEntriesByCampaigncode or one index codeTrackingEntriesByCampaigncode that contains the interaction. Is multiple indexes overkill here It may be. There are currently 4 types of interaction and there may be others introduced later. These queries are very quick when I have a few records. But will they still be as quick as they can be when there are hundreds of thousands or even millions of records p  pLooking at the overall design, it seems that, for every object that has a collection property that might need to be queried by a property on that collection, I should create MapReduce indexes. Is that a good rule of thumb to follow Are there others  if you have these types of object interactions you should be thinking about creating these kind of indexesp

Unfortunately since I would like to use pointers to ic and dc as members in another class I cannot use references since references as members have to be initialized and once initialized they cannot be changed to refer to another object. Id like to be able to make arithmetic operations with ic and dc e.g.p  precodedc d1, d2, d3 ic i1, i2, i3 d1  d1i1  i2d2  d3i3 codepre  pHowever I want my code to look nice and dont want to have codecode all over the place. Instead something like thisp  precoded1  d1i1  i2d2  d3i3 codepre  pThis is the reason why Id like to do this. Please let me know if this is possible at all. To me it seems that the compiler wants to call the default pointer to pointer assignment instead of the overloaded one. p  pThanks for your help in advancep

Negative 26711 pVisual SVN Server allows you to create SVN repositories and SVN projects.  Those who strictly have client SVN access using Tortoise for example cannot create projects.  However, they do have the ability to create folders as they wish.  When an SVN project is created on the server side, you have the ability to automatically generate the tags, branches and trunk folders for a given SVN project.  On the other hand, you could manually create a project folder, and those three identical sub folders from Tortoise SVN.  Is there anything different between the two architecturally on the server side  Does creating on the server side give any extra functionality for example  I just want to avoid maintenance on the server side for our administrator if it does not.p  pEDITp  pIm sorry, they use the term New  Project Structure...p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comfdIbP.jpg altenter image description herep

Negative 26711 pI followed a set of instructions from multiple sources about how to deploy apps ad hoc without the need for itunes however, I ran into a discrepancy. I got the necessary distribution certificate, made an ad hoc provisioning profile, used the profile to build and archive, shared the app, filled out the necessary fields, uploaded the .ipa and .plist files to my server, and tested. I couldnt install the app because there was no provisioning profile on the device. I uploaded the provisioning profile, tried downloading it from the device, and it worked. Now I can download and install the apps without connecting to my computer.p  pHowever, when testing on a different device, the app refused to run. I found out that it was because the mobile provisioning file was refusing to install, and that was because developer mode was not turned on on the device. I then found out that in order to turn on developer mode I have to connect to a computer.p  pIs there a way around this issue, to either turn on developer mode without connecting to a computer, or to not need the provisioning profile installation installed, or to somehow install the provisioning profile on the device without developer mode onp  pI dont see a mention of developer mode or the provisioning profile on this page a hrefhttpdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosfeaturedarticlesFAWirelessEnterpriseAppDistributionIntroductionIntroduction.html relnofollowhttpdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosfeaturedarticlesFAWirelessEnterpriseAppDistributionIntroductionIntroduction.htmlap  pWhat am I missing here Thanks.p
Negative 26711 pI have two content types in a Drupal 7.20 environment which embed views or blocks.  When I allow those content types in search results, the results page goes sideways whenever those content types are represented in the result set the pager shows a different number of total pages from one results page to the next, or disappears entirely after I hit Next , fewer than 10 results show per page yet theres a pager..., etc., etc.p  pIf I disallow those content types via Custom Search, I dont see any problems with pagination, etc.p  pWhat I have noticed is that the actual viewsblocks get executed when the search results page is constructed  its not merely a matter of hits being found in the searchindex table.p  pAnybody know how to address this problemp  pIve searched through stackoverflow, and issues for Search and Custom Search on Drupal.org  no joy.p  pThanks in advance,  Leep  p[Edit fixed a couple of typos...] [31713 Edit The problem turns out to be due to the pager for the view or block that is included in the search result set.  If the view is in the result set, but doesnt have a pager, there is no problem.  My solution, therefore, is to detect that Im on a search results page in hookviewsqueryalter by looking at the request URI and setp  precodeviewgtitemsperpage  0  codepre  pwhich effectively gets rid of the views pager.p

Negative 26711 pI am developing an acquisition device which requires DMA operation to transfer large data frames to the main memory.

Negative 26711 pI used to add codeTransactionalcode annotations to all spring services classes. And then I thought do I really have to, if the transactinal behaviour should be the same Of course, if it shouldnt, we would add codeTransationalcode with other parameters to methods. I tried to find some useful information about inheritance with codeTransactionalcode, read about codeInheritedcode and it looks like codeTransactionalcode is codeInheritedcode.

Negative 26711 pI wrote a multithread program with pthread, using the producerconsumer model. p  pWhen I use Intel VTune profiler to profile my program, I found the producer and consumer spend lots of time on pthreadmutexunlock.

It shows the codes where consumer tries to fetch an item from the buffer, and time consumed by each code line.p  pMy question is that why pthreadmutexunlock has such overhead Is the problem with pthread mutex itself or with the way I use it img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comc7WuP.png altenter image description herep

Negative 26711 pIm working on writing a gem that has several gem dependencies, one of which depends on a gem that broke backwards compatibility in a newer version.

I would also like that text to be a link to a position on that same page Im sure I can manage that though.p  pIf anyone could put something together in jsfiddle for me that would be very much appreciated as I am not capable enough yet of being able to modify jQuery existing examples to what I need.p  pThanksp

Negative 26711 pIm making an app that records sound and stores it somewhere on your phone. I have a tab layout and two activities in this tab layout. The first activity is recording activity and the second is library activity, where all of the recorded sounds will be stored. This is what Im trying to do.p  pHow the app works at the moment After Im done recording a dialog pops up with edittext, asking a user to rename the recorded file. After a user typed a certain name, it is added to ArrayList, I instantly called the putExtra. p  precodefileNames  new ArrayList fileNames.addnewFileName intent.putExtrafileNames, fileNames codepre  pNow this is where it stops. I never had problems with passing extras between activities. But Ive never done it with a tab layout before. So my question is how do I pass extra between two activities that are under the same tab layout I want to do this because I then want to read the arraylist in the library activity so that I can make a listview of all recorded files.p  pEDIT This is the code nowp  pFirst activityp  precodefileNames  new ArrayList fileNames.addnewFileName getParent.getIntent.putExtralibraryFileNames, fileNames codepre  pSecond activityp  precodeArrayList fileNames creating a global variable for arraylist outisde of the oncreate fileNames  getParent.getIntent.getStringArrayListExtralibraryFileNames codepre  pIs this the right way to approach it The one flaw I noticed is that Im taking the extra as string array while I have a normal ArrayList, not a string arraylist. Also, how could I test if this worksp

Negative 26711 pAlright, so Im pretty new to Spring, but I was asked to resolve a bug. So in our application, we have a page that queries a database based on an id. However, not all entries are unique to the id. The id and date pair, on the other hand, do define unique entries. p  pSo this page takes in an id. If there is only a single entry related to this id, everything works fine. However, if there are multiple entries, the page displays a radio button selection of the various dates that pertain to that id. We use something like p  blockquote   plt formradiobutton idloadDate pathloadDate valuedate labeldate p blockquote  pLater on the same page, we want to display the data for that option. As part of it, we display the date of that selection p  blockquote   plt forminput idaiLoadDate pathloadDate maxlength22 size22 classreadonly readonlytruep blockquote  pThe problem is that when this happens, the variable or bean Im not quite sure about Spring yet.. loadDate a string ends up being the same date twice, seperated with a comma. Im guessing the problem here is the pathloadDate that is common to both lines. p  pInstead of appending the date to the already existing one like a csv, Id like it to overwrite the current entry intead. Is there a way to do this p

Negative 26711 pI have a quick question about the codeFINDPACKAGEcode function in CMake. I have a project which utilizes the point cloud library PCL.

I cleaned the cache of the browser on the device 2 times just in case...br Then I visit the website and the cssjsjpgico files were not updated. Not even if I access them by directly typing their addresses in the addressbar.br Then I tried it on 2 other different devices. No success.br So I went back to my main computer and downloaded the files using my ftp login and yes the files were up2date. I waited more than a day for my favicon to show up correctly. But its still the original Joomla icon.  p  pNow you might think that I used a wrong ftp account, but I notices something very very weird. When I click show sourcecode in Firefox and then click on the link to the css file in the appearing window it shows the old file as expected.., but after pressing F5 it actually shows the correct one. When I now go back to the browser and type the address of my website again the new css is actually applied. When I reload it anothertime everything goes back to the old one though.  p  pUploading strongnewstrong files that didnt exist before are no problem at all btw.

Negative 26711 pIm trying to create a program to compare the amount of time it takes various haskell scripts to run, which will later be used to create graphs and displayed in a GUI. Ive tried to create said GUI using Haskell libraries but I havent had much luck, especially since Im having trouble finding up to date GUI libraries for Windows.

Negative 26711 pMy situation is thisp  pI am trying to look for some medical records. As part of refining my search I have built an index with 10k known documents. Theoretically, if I have the correct search I should be able to iterate through that entire set, search for each one and find it as the highest score document and first.p  pExcept, thats not the behavior I am seeing. 310 times the document I am looking for. Sometimes isnt even in the top 5. The reason for this is that the documents are all scoring the same.

Negative 26711 pWe have a calendar function on our site which enables people to book reservations.

It appears that month 12 is getting passed to the booking widget as month 00.

Unfortunately, I am a js newbee and the company I partnered with on this project has only a skeleton crew this week. I am at a loss of what might be wrong with this.

Negative 26711 pI have been trying go make a calculator app and have been having trouble with getting the equals button to work. I have gotten to the root of the problem and whats wrong but have no idea how do fix it. p  pWhen the user enters a number, presses the multiply button or , ,  the instance variable storedResult saves the number before they enter the next set of numbers to multiply. When the user presses , whats supposed to happen is current screen a UILabel get multiplied by the storedResult variable and convert that back to a string and put it in the UILabel. This does not happen. The UILabel always reads zero.p  pFrom playing around with the console I found that the problem seems to be that when converting current screen UILabel to an integer or double, float, int the number in the screen gets set to zero.

Negative 26711 pIve inherited a report spec subsystem that needs to be tweaked.  The mission is  to add  a date column to the tReports table, and populate it with the CreateDate that is supposed to be contained in the XML Code Spec.  The problem is that some of the older reports dont have the CREATEDATE attribute, or as in one example below, the XML is valid but poorly formed, and the CREATEDATE cannot be retrieved using the xQuery that works for most of the other reports. Since I dont have an explicit creation date included in the spec, Im using interpolation to estimate a reasonable date.  One factor of the interpolation is to look at the date strings contained in the report specsome will be useful, others not. p  pThere are too many reports over 1,200 to visually skim each report spec for date strings.  These date strings can appear in any location in the report spec, and there are a very large number of combinations of elements and attributes that can contain a date string. p  pThe ideal solution would be a listing of the reportIDs and the date string ready to use in an UPDATE, but because date format varies mdyy, mmddyy, mddyy ... Id be grateful to get a vew spurious characters surrounding the date string that I could clean up later. p  pAll the date strings will be from 2000 or later, so the search string Iv been using  is 20 which has provided good results. p  pIve looked at many sites that discuss this kind of issue, and found only one solution by Mikael Eriksson that is something like what Im describing, but I cant make it work after several hours of playing with it. a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4843121howtoextractmultiplestringsfromsinglerowsinsqlSERVERHow to extract multiple strings from single rows in SQL

Negative 26711 pIm working on getting a midi compiler, PMML, working again. Yes, its a programming language in its own right that compiles standard midi files. In brief, after getting the program working fine under windows, using both cygwin and minGW, latest versions, I wanted to move on to a linux system to get it working.p  pBefore moving it to the linux system however, some inital patches had to be applied.p  ol liMove externs of system functions out of local header files in the project, to eliminate type conflicts.li liReplace these by including system headers, stdlib.h, string.h and in cases where it was needed, errno.h.li liAlso replaced this construct, syserrlist[errno] with strerrorerrno. This enabled the package to compile quite cleanly under windows, and work.li ol  pI chose arch Linux 64bit, running under VMWare player 6.0.2 in windows 7 64bit. When I moved the sources to arch, they compiled fine, but then failed at the test suite, giving a segfault. Subsequent poking about with gdb revealed that somehow, a function is getting bad memory, but I cant for the life of me figure out why its doing this. I understand that windows and Linux allocate memory differently, but just cant see why the problems showing up. Any help tracking this down would be appreciated.  The sources Im working with are here. a hrefhttpsdl.dropboxusercontent.comu3051632pmml0.2p2.tar.gz relnofollowhttpsdl.dropboxusercontent.comu3051632pmml0.2p2.tar.gzap  pThanksp  pedit. seems that after eying the code for a while, the answers just smacked me in the face... One of those really simple things. Seems that in the function getexpression, where the program segfaulted, the reason it crashed was... a simple unassigned variable problem that the compile didnt catch. Now, to figure out what to pass to the function to get it working.p

Negative 26711 pSimilar to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions20366892resizinghandlesonarotatedelementResizing Handles on a Rotated Elementa, Im implementing a way for the user to scale an Image through handles in codelibGDXcode. A problem I keep bumping into is the scaling of the Image. I currently use a hrefhttpscode.google.complibgdxwikiscene2d relnofollowcodeScene2Dcodea which I used to create a codeGroupcode which contains the Image and 8 handles around the Image. The positions of the handles are defined relative to the Image. This works fine for rotation and translation, but not for scaling. When the codeGroupcode gets rescaled, so does the handle. But because of the scaling, the offset between the handle and the image is not the same anymore. I hacked around a bit to be able to draw the handles at the correct place even with scaling. But the problem is the bounds of the Handles. This is important for the mouse to be able to select the correct region which is also a rectangle. After setting the bounds, these are transformed and the scaling messes with the handles size and location. Is using a codeGroupcode a dead end Are there better ways to handle this problemp  pIn short I want handles to be placed around an Image to rescale it. The handles position has to move correctly with any transformation on the Image and the handles size has to remain intact.p  pA solution might be to avoid the scaling by resizing the width and height yourself. This however doesnt scale the codeActorscode within the codeGroupcode as you would expect.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comWP73S.gif altexample representation of resize handlesp

This accounts to 11.7 reduction in bus cycles Also, since the block size is increased in the inner loop, the resource stalls decrease by 25.5. These 2 accounts for 18 reduction in response time.  The mystery question is, why are instruction retired increased by 7.9 Which accounts for increase in response time by 6.51  Possible reason I could this of is 1. Since the number of branch instructions increase inside the block and core architecture has 8 bit global history retired branch instruction increased by 2.5 Although, misprediction remained the same I know, smells fishy right. But I am still missing answer for the rest 5.4 Could anyone please shed me light in any direction Im completely out of options and No way to think. Thanks a lotp

Negative 26711 pI want to calculate the squared euclidean distance between two sets of points, codeinputscode and codetestingcode. codeinputscode is typically a real array of size 200, N, whereas codetestingcode is typically 1e8, N, and N is around 10. The distances should be scaled in each dimension in N, so Id be aggregating the expression codescale[j]inputs[i,j]  testing[ii,j]2code where codescalecode is the scaling vector over N times. I am trying to make this as fast as possible, particularly as N can be large. My first test isp  precodedef oldversion  inputs, testing, x0      nn, d1  testing.shape     n, d1  inputs.shape     b  np.zeros  n, nn     for d in xrange  d1          b  x0[d] np.tile  inputs[, d],  nn, 1               np.tile  testing[, d],  n, 1.T2.T return b codepre  pNothing too fancy. I then tried using codescipy.spatial.distance.cdistcode, although I still have to loop through it to get the scaling rightp  precodedef newversion  inputs, testing, x0       import scipy.spatial.distance as dist     nn, d1  testing.shape     n, d1  inputs.shape     b  np.zeros  n, nn      for d in xranged1         b  x0[d]dist.cdist  inputs[,d][, None],               testing[,d][,None], sqeuclidean     return b codepre  pIt would appear that codenewversioncode scales better as N  1000, but Im not sure that Ive gone as fast as possible here. Any further ideas much appreciatedp

Negative 26711 pAs the title suggests, I want to detect the exact timestamp when an element with a particular id or CSS class is inserted into the DOM and possibly detect when it is removed. The most obvious method is to poll the document periodically, by calling codedocument.getElementByIdcode with the id of the element I want to find, but this method is not very accurate and can be very performance intensive if I have multiple elements I want to detect.p  pI took a look at a hrefhttpsdeveloper.mozilla.orgenUSdocsWebGuideEventsMutationevents relnofollowMutation Eventsa and a hrefhttpsdeveloper.mozilla.orgendocsWebAPIMutationObserver relnofollowMutation Observersa, but from what I understand, in order to detect if an element is inserted or removed, I have to add a listener to the root DOM element, which can heavily impact performance if I need to execute additional JS each time an element is inserted or removed from the page.p  pIs there a more optimized solution that I am not aware of Also, I would prefer if I didnt use an external JS library, even jQuery.p
Negative 26711 pI was expecting the same behavior of truncate in SQL and HIVE. But its different. I want to confirm if I am perceiving it wronglyp  p1 In SQL, The following command drop table and create again. All partitions are dropped if existp  precodemysqlgt truncate table t1 codepre  p2 In HIVE, The following command just delete the data from the table. It do not drop the existing partitions. We need to drop it manually.p  precodehivegt truncate table t1 codepre  pI found one more issue, If we add column to a partitioned table with altering it. Then there will be a problem in insert overwrite data to the table. Work around found was to drop all the existing partitions on the table.p  pIs it a issue in HIVEversion 0.13  What are the other difference in using truncate for HIVE and SQLp

Negative 26711 pI want to be able to change which codeActivitycode is run when the user runs the application.p  pI know how to do this in the applications manifest file, but I would like to do it programmatically after install. The reason being, I want the user to be able to choose which screen loads when he opens the application.p  pHow can I do this The only way I know of seems very clunky have an essentially empty Activity which has the MAIN intentfilter  which then reads the users settings and transfers the user to the desired Activity. This creates a lot of mess, like the backstack needs to be considered, and the overheads of loading one activity straight after another seems wasteful of time and resources. p

Negative 26711 pIm working with Wordpress and a plugin called a hrefhttpswordpress.orgpluginsrealestatelistingrealtynawpl relnofollowWPLa. Basically, the system is set up so that my WP users are, upon sign up, automatically activated as WPL users.  However, I need to have this differentiated based on user roles.  So, I have four different WP roles, and four corresponding WPL roles.  I think I found the code where WPL extracts the code information.p  precodepublic static function getwplroles      roles  array     roles[superadmin]  superadmin     roles[admin]  administrator     roles[editor]  editor     roles[agent]  author     roles[Contributor]  Contributor     roles[subscriber]  subscriber     roles[guest]  guest     roles[ten]  ten     roles[trio]  trio     roles[single]  single     roles[unlimited]  unlimited      return roles        input role     return role point     author Howard  public static function getrolepointrole       get all roles      roles  selfgetwplroles       role validation      ifinarrayrole, roles role  guest      rolespoint  array     rolespoint[superadmin]  6     rolespoint[administrator]  5     rolespoint[editor]  4     rolespoint[author]  3     rolespoint[Contributor]  2     rolespoint[subscriber]  1     rolespoint[guest]  0      return rolespoint[role]  codepre  pThe last four roles in the top section ten, trio, single, and unlimited are my WP roles.  When someone signs up under one of these roles, I want them to be automatically instated under the same role headings which have been created already in WPL.p  pRight now, all WP users are automatically instated as WPL users under the default role.  Which Im guessing is because of this linep  precode    ifinarrayrole, roles role  guest codepre  pBut I cant seem to find where guest is defined.  The default WPL role is just called Default, not guest.  So, Im confused there.p  pThe second part of the code has numbers involved  so I am not sure how to add my other four roles.  And I assume I need four new sections under a different if statement.p

Negative 26711 pI am using the Powerpoint Interop to develop a Powerpoint 20102013 AddIn. As part of this, I need a reliable way to map picture shapes to filenames.p  pMy original plan was to simply look them up based on order of appearance in the slides, keeping a counter of images found. I would then use this to look into the .pptx archive and figure out what images were on what slides e.g. first picture found  Picture 1.jpg, etc.p  pHowever, this does not seem to work in cases where a single image appears on more than one slide. codeShape.Idcode does not seem to be consistent per shape across slides, and codeShape.Namecode is stated to only be per slide in the MSDN documentation.p  pIs there a reliable way to compare picture shapes across slides, or will I have to resort to comparing widthheight to try and find matchesp

Negative 26711 pI am building a product using Web Api for the backend and AngularJS on the client side, expecting to launch in a couple of months. All logic is fairly well separated from the client.p  pBeing the sole developer and marketing, sales, etc I am very keen on maximizing efficiency and therefore looking at Cordova to handle the mobile app side of things. I have never done any iOsAndroid development, but am very quick at picking up new languages and environments so I do not consider that my primary barrier to entry, but I am more concerned with duplication of work effort.p  pMy question is thus would approaching a smallish application with the intent of having a single code base by way of Cordova be the right method I am concerned about having to deal with 3 types of styling to handle iOSAndroid menus and slight UI differences between web and mobile applications. Do I just litter with my code with a whole bunch of ifiOS menua, elseifAndroid menub, else menuc p  pOr, would trying to keep the clients as thin as possible and writing native AndroidiOS apps be a smarter approach Here my only real issue is extra effort of maintaining three code bases for the clients.p  pIve done a lot of reading around and while the opinions seem to be pretty split, no one focuses on the complexity of maintaining multiple code bases with thin clients versus the coding overhead of handling styling with one code base across multiple platforms.p  pThanks for your input,p

Negative 26711 pI am parsing dates with Android class codejava.text.SimpleDateFormatcode by passing a specific pattern. However I use multiple data sources and there can be two different date patterns, sometimes there is no day of the week in the date, i.e. I expect to run either one of the two pieces of codep  precodenew SimpleDateFormatEEE dd MMM yyyy, Locale.US.parsemyDate new SimpleDateFormatdd MMM yyyy, Locale.US.parsemyDate codepre  pBut I did not find any way to discriminate between these two cases on another criterion than the value of the String codemyDatecode. p  pSo far, I can run one of the two lines of code and catch the codeParseExceptioncode in case I run the wrong one and I run the other in the catch block. My second option is to do some previous analysis with codeString.matchesStringcode or manipulating codePatterncode.p  pAs unnecessarily throwing an Exception is a bad practice, and before I reinvent the wheel by implementing the Date parsing tools, is there any other class or library that would let me test a pattern ideally something like codeSimpleDateFormat.isParseableStringcode that would return false if codeSimpleDateFormat.parseStringcode throws a ParseException.p  pSo far I searched among SimpleDateFormat methods and its parents, but I could not find any tip or anyone running in such problem.p  pHere is the current codep  precodeDate parseDateString myDate   String expectedDate     try     expectedDate  new SimpleDateFormatEEE dd MMM yyyy, Locale.US.parsemyDate      this is the first possible pattern for the date    catchParseException e  I consider it bad practice and too expensive to run code there     expectedDate  new SimpleDateFormatdd MMM yyyy, Locale.US.parsemyDate      this is the second possible pattern for the date      return expectedDate  codepre  pAnd, as I added in a comment, I noticed the issue because I order a list of items displayed in a codeListViewcode based on their date and I can notice the difference in terms of performance.p

Negative 26711 pI have a set of absolutely positioned fluid divs within a container and want to display an image within each div that is vertically and horizontally centred within the container and fills up as much of the available space as possible. Due to using these images for other purposes they have to be img tags and not background images otherwise with CSS3 this would be easyp  pI would have thought the following code should do just this but for some reason on Firefox the image displays in its original dimensions and is not constrained by the parent dimensions. In Chrome the width seems to be correctly linked to the container however the img height is not constrained by the container height.p  pI could understand it if there was no widthheight set on the parent but every element in this example has a percentage widthheight set so i dont think this is the problem. FYI if you set a specific width100 on the img then this constrains the width correctly but cant be done as it means its loses the correct aspect however it still doesnt work for height even if you set the height to 100,p  pYou can see a jsfiddle at a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netdeshgxrzk084d relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netdeshgxrzk084da and the code is below.p  pIf anyone could point me in the right direction as to what im doing wrong that would be greatly appreciatedp  precode    body, html, outer          width 100         height 100         margin 0         padding 0           container          backgroundcolor ffcc00         display table         position absolute         left 20         top 30         width 60         height 40           containerinner          display tablecell         width 100         height 100         verticalalign middle           containerinner img          maxwidth 100         maxheight 100         margin 0 auto         display block           ltdiv idoutergt         ltdiv idcontainergt             ltdiv idcontainerinnergt                 ltimg srchttpsdl.dropboxusercontent.comswypn5e7n5bgeoiclandscape.pngdl0 altgt             ltdivgt         ltdivgt     ltdivgt codepre  pCheers,p  pDavep

Negative 26711 pI know that there is a Git plugin for Eclipse Egit, but I like to do Git stuff on the command line, and I like to code in Eclipse, so I want to keep them separate.p  pI cloned a Git repo I dont think its important, but for good measure, it was codehttpsgithub.comspinscaledropwizardjobs.gitcode. I then opened up Eclipse Juno and created a new Java project, and selected the root of the cloned repo as the base path to my project. Eclipse asked me if I wanted to associate the project with the Java facet, and I clicked OK.p  pThis project has a large dependency tree if you like, check out its 4 POM files. I dont use Maven to build I use Gradle so I just ran a script that resolves the dependencies of these POMs into a directory, and then I created a codelibcode directory in this Eclipse project and copied all the JARs into it. I then added all these JARs to the projects classpath.p  pI am now seeing 10 errors in the strongProblemsstrong view in Eclipse, and theyre all similar errorsp  ul liThe type ApplicationStartTestJob is already defined ApplicationStartTestJob.java dropwizardjobsdropwizardjobscoresrctestjavadespinscaledropwizardjobs    line 10 Java Problemli liThe type ApplicationStartTestJob is already defined ApplicationStartTestJob.java dropwizardjobsdropwizardjobsguicesrctestjavadespinscaledropwizardjobs   line 10 Java Problemli li8 more all like this, etc.li ul  pSure enough, when I expand the entire project, I see it has the following structurep  precodedropwizardjobs     dropwizardjobscore         srctestjava             de.spinscale.dropwizard.jobs                 ApplicationStartTestJob.java     dropwizardjobsguice         srctestjava             de.spinscale.dropwizard.jobs                 ApplicationStartTestJob.java     dropwizardjobsspring         srctestjava             de.spinscale.dropwizard.jobs                 ApplicationStartTestJob.java codepre  pSo it seems that the maintainers of this project like to rename their unit tests with the exact same packageclass names, and for some reason, Eclipse sees them as all belonging inside the same package. To test this I renamed codedropwizardjobscoresrcmainjavade.spinscale.dropwizard.jobs.ApplicationStartTestcode to something else, and did the same for codedropwizardjobsguicesrcmainjavade.spinscale.dropwizard.jobs.ApplicationStartTestcode and sure enough, all the errors associated with codeApplicationStartTestcode being already defined went away.p  pstrongSo my suspicion is confirmedstrong The emintentionem of these subfolders codedropwizardjobscorecode, codedropwizardjobsguicecode and codedropwizardjobsspringcode is that they are emsubprojectsem with separate classpaths. Eclipse thinks all of these source folders are part of the same project, and so it is lumping all of their classes into the same classpath. Since each subproject uses the same unit test naming conventions same packageclass names for each subproject, Eclipse see multiple classes in the same package as having the same name.p  pOK, good I figured out the problem. strongBut whats the solutionstrong Ideally I would be able to keep all of these inside the same project, but perhaps modify the code.classpathcode file or do something similar that instruct Eclipse to keep the subprojects separated from a classpath perspective. Any ideasp

Negative 26711 pIm developing a native iOS app and have a backend PHP server communicated with HTTPS.p  pWhat I have now is that I can login with usernamepassword login, facebook or google login. The server will generate a token and send it to the user. The user will use this for every call to the server.p  pBut  The server guy have chosen to send a new token every time a make a call. I think this is bad design for several reasons.  Should it expire If so, how can I seamless for the user experience renew the token If not, isnt this vulnerablep  pIs above a good design I would also like to know what you guys are using as your security designp  pCheers.p

Negative 26711 pI am experiencing a strange bug in PhoneGap on Android 4.4, for which I couldnt find any solution online. In my app, I am loading a lot of different images from a remote server, and as the user navigates back and forth, new images are loaded on each page 4 at a time, to be specific, through jQuerygenerated html. After having navigated back and forth for a little while, some images will randomly not show up and instead show the typical broken image icon.p  pNow, here comes the strange part I have been following the instructions at a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions92720jqueryjavascripttoreplacebrokenimagesjQueryJavascript to replace broken imagesa and done a few tests of my own. In conclusion, the naturalWidth and naturalHeight parameters report the right sizes of the images, and complete reports true for all images. Therefore, the solutions mentioned in the above SO thread dont work at all. Changing the image src doesnt help, either with or without a setTimeout I tried adding the current timestamp as a parameter to the image path as well.p  pDid anyone else encounter this issue at all, or am I going crazy here p  pEDIT By the way, no error is ever reported. Therefore, no error handler is called when loading the image, making it useless to solve the problem with the already suggested methods see the link above.p

Negative 26711 pI am working on a wearable device using the Invensense 9D AccelGyroCompass which computes a quaternion for realtime orientation, using the embedded Digital Motion Processor running a Kalman filter.  Sadly  the DMP code is not something that Invensense allows endusers access to.p  pThe resulting quaternions in our application suffer from some drift.  But weve been able to work within that by taking the differences between the Euler angles over short timeframes.  But Euler angles are obviously less than desirable because of their inherent issues gimbal lock, etc.p  pWhere Im struggling is computing the difference between two quaternions  which should be codeDiff  q2  conjq1code  then computing the codePitchcode and codeRollcode changes required to get from codeq1code to codeq2code.

I understand that there are emnumberem of different rotation sequences to get from a Quaternion to an Euler angle.  Ive tried over a dozen of them, none of which yields the same answer as taking the difference of the Euler angles from the individual Quaternions.p  pIt feels like Im missing something obvious  but Im just not seeing it.p  pThanksp

Negative 26711 pIn the documentation for a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopms74168828vvs.8529.aspx relnofollowcodeWSARecvcodea, it saysp  blockquote   pIf lpCompletionRoutine is not NULL, the hEvent parameter is ignored   and can be used by the application to pass context information to the   completion routine.p blockquote  pWhat does context information means I think it means that I will usually associate a data structure with each socket, which can contain members such as the socket handle and the receive buffer. And so when I call codeWSARecvcode I will pass to it a pointer to an instance of this data structure, and when I get notified that a receive operation has completed, I will get the pointer I passed earlier, and so I will know which socket has initiated the receive operation, and what is the receive buffer, etc.p  pIs my understanding correctp

When I tried the code I added yesterday, that stopped working as well. The first thing I do is create a function to get anything from the url that I need. The first 2 inputs are for following users. The first input should send the id variable to the url bar and is retrieved in the php file called follow.php. The second input should do the same thing. Finally the last function is for liking peoples posts. It sends the type of likelike or unlike to the php file named like.php and is retrieved there. And should post the retrieved data into a div called likes. However, none of which is occurring when the buttons are pressed. Even when I just send an alert to make sure the on click is working, nothing happens either. Here is my codep  precodefunction getParameterByNamename  name  name.replace[[], [.replace[]], ] var regex  new RegExp[amp]  name  [amp],     results  regex.execlocation.search return results  null    decodeURIComponentresults[1].replaceg,   codepre  pp  precodeinputsub.onclick, function     var id  getParameterByNameid     .getfollow.php , id id, functiondata       location.reload        inputsub1.onclick, function     var id  getParameterByNameid     .getunfollow.php , id id, functiondata     location.reload           function doActionpostid , type     alertWorks     .postlike.php , postid postid type type , functiondata         divlikes.textdata       codepre
Negative 26711 pSo Ive been making board game Funny Bunny childrens game on Java. I first made it text based but now Ive been building a GUI for it using Swing. The trouble is, Ive never made a GUI before and tough the GUI itself has been fairly easy to make, I find it incredibly hard to combine my game and the GUI.p  pIll first explain the basic idea of the game.p  pTHE GAMEp  ul liThere are 24 players and they all have four game pieces.li lipTheres a deck of special card that run the game 4 types move 1, 2 or 3 steps and card for changing the board.pli lipOne turn consists of player revealing a cardp  blockquote   pIf its a move card, the move a piece   If its change the board card, the board changes and holes may open. Some places on the board arent safe, game pieces might drop in a holep blockquoteli ul  pSo, the idea behind the game is fairly simple.p  pstrongThe trouble, Ive got no idea how to actually make it work with a GUI.strong I tought itd be rather and started enthuastically building my GUI. I made the game view Ill add a picture, main menu, number of players menu and all that stuff just to realize that I dont know how to really make it work with eventdriven game.p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comI3YKd.png relnofollowGame view, work in progress, never mind the colorsap  pId like to GUI version work along these lines  1. First, bunch of menus for setting up the players and stuff. Thats okay.  2. In the game view, player reveals a card by pushing Show card  3. Based on the type of the card enter either stage  3.1 Move a game piece. This would happen by clicking a game piece either button on the side or a piece on the game board  This would start move a piece process  Requires updating the board in the end OR 3.2 Change the board, which would updating the GUI board. strongIm really lost with how to do this.strongp  pShould I use something like threads, or Swing Worker or what should I do Do you people want to see some sample code Thatd probably help. Just let me know, and Ill post some it requires some translating with the comments and stuff and thats why I didnt want just randomly post parts of my code herep  pAll help, comments, feedback... everything would highly appreciated and really helpful.

Negative 26711 pI have implemented a custom codeNSViewcode which contains many codeNSTextFieldcodes and other codeNSViewcodes. I then embedded that custom view in a scroll view using Editor  Embed In  Scroll View. This creates the appropriate hierarchy as visible in the Outline, but I needed to then add Auto Layout constraints to specify where this scroll view should be placed within the view top, bottom, leading, trailing. Additionally I had to add constraints for the custom view, set against the clip view, in order to lay out the elements in the correct location. This works well, when I run the app all the elements appear appropriately and the view does bounce scroll. However, when I reduce the height of the main view so that that not all of the elements fit on screen, auto layout warnings appear and when I update the frames it increases the height of the view again. To fix that, I had to remove the scroll views bottom constraint to the main view. Now when I run the app, the window is set to the right size, but I cannot scroll the custom view to get to the bottom of the content  its restricted so it wont scroll at all besides the elastic bounce effect because youre at the edge limit. So my question is, what must I do in order to allow this scroll view to scroll when Im laying out all elements in a XIB and using Auto Layoutp

Let say, all id em44455em have value for description which is emsomethingem. strongIt shouldnt be displayedstrong. But for id em12345em all the description is emsomethingem except 1 row that contain different value which is, emtestemp  pSo, the rows that should be displayed are strongdescriptionstrong that contains value emnullem, and rows that contains different values strongdescriptionstrong based on identifier strongidstrong. From the example above, it should be printedp  precodeid     date        user  item        material       Text  Description   12345  31.03.2015  ID00  00010  000000001011000106  abcd   something    12345  31.03.2015  ID00  00020  000000001011010105  abcd   test        12345  31.03.2015  ID00  00030  000000001011020106  abcd   something   12345  31.03.2015  ID00  00040  000000001011020104  abcd   something   codepre  pHow can I make a condition in query for this case Any advisep  pThanks in advancep

Negative 26711 pI have a DataGridView with filtering. When the filter is applied the scroll position is returned to the top and the data in the grid is updated as expected. When I then scroll down using the scroll bar then click on a row, the scroll jumps back up to the top again and the wrong row gets selected. Then I scroll down again and click, no reset. This is the behavior I expected.p  pI understand why the first jump occurs because the grid has effectively been rebound to a new source. However, why it jumps back up again after scrolling and clicking is a bit vexing. I have tried using both a BindingList and a BindingSource. I have tried calling all sorts of update and refreshes and position resets on the DataGridView to try to induce the second reset programatically instead of when the user clicks. Any ideasp  pThe only other wrinkle is that Im using the MVVM pattern with databinding to approximate the knockout.js we use on the web. Functionally, this shouldnt differ from something like txtPartNumberQueryOnChangedRebindGridp  pI figured this out right after I took the time to write it up, so...

Negative 26711 pI have a bunch of enums that I want Json.NET to serialize as camelcased strings. I have the following in my Global.asax.cs file and its working greatp  precodeHttpConfiguration config  GlobalConfiguration.Configuration config.Formatters.JsonFormatter.SerializerSettings.Converters.Addnew Newtonsoft.Json.Converters.StringEnumConverter  CamelCaseText  true  codepre  pThis makes it so an enum like thisp  precodepublic enum FavoriteWebSite      StackOverflow,     GoogleNews      Etc  codepre  pwill serialize to values like stackOverflow, googleNews, etc.p  pHowever, I have a couple enums that are bitwise masks. To make this a simple example, suppose one looks like thisp  precodepublic enum Hobbies      Walking  0x01,     Biking  0x02,      Etc  codepre  pWhat happens when I serialize instances of this enum depends on what kind of values are in it. For examplep  precodeHobbies set1  Hobbies.Walking                   Serializes as walking  bad Hobbies set2  Hobbies.Walking  Hobbies.Biking  Serializes as 3        good codepre  pI want to override the serialization on this enum to just serialize as an int, while leaving the global setting to use camelcased strings intact. p  pI tried removing the global configuration so that enums by default are serialized as ints, then adding only code[JsonConvertertypeofStringEnumConverter]code to the nonbitmask enums. However, this results in PascalCased, rather than CamelCased serialization for those. I didnt see any way to get the CamelCaseText attribute set when using StringEnumConverter in a method decoration like above.p  pSo, to recap, the goal isp  ol liHave singlevalue enums be serialized as pascalCased strings.li liHave bitmask enums be serialized as ints.li ol  pThank youp

The problem is, when I navigate back from B to A, As layout is not updated inside codeanimateTransitioncode yet. Therefore frames I get from subviews of As view are not correct.p  pThis is especially a problem when you push the next view controller, rotate the device and navigate back.p  pcodeviewDidLayoutSubviewscode of A is called right after codeanimateTransitioncode and early enough for the view to be updated before it becomes visible, but still too late for me to get the correct frames for the animation inside codeanimateTransitioncode.p  pIs there any way to layout that view controllers view before codeanimateTransitioncode is calledp

Negative 26711 pSimply put, is there any way to control or configure the HTML tags used to generate the HTML for the getHTML methodp  pAfter much searching on the internet and here as well, I havent found a satisfactory answer. I am aware that you could possibly extend RichTextArea, but before I go that route, I would just like to be sure that there isnt something that Ive missed.p  pCurrently, when I use getHTML, codeltdivgtcode and codeltbrgtcode are used as way to essentially create line breaks and paragraphs. I would like to change this to use codeltpgtcode instead, and most likely get rid of the codeltbrgtcode tag altogether.p

Negative 26711 pI am trying to write a program which acquires an image from a webcam, averages over several of the vertical pixel rows, displays the result and then applies a Gaussian fit to locate the peak position with a high degree of accuracy. All of this is to be done in real time. I used a timer object to run the function called datain which triggers the camera and acquires the data. To iterate and update the data the function includes a while loop. My code worked perfectly until I added a command inside the while loop to call another function called GaussianFit which preformed the fit. When this function is added I receive an error which says the callback function in the timer does not have enough inputs.  p  pError while evaluating TimerFcn for timer timer1 Not enough input arguments. p  pThis seems odd since the data acquisition function provides all the inputs needed by the fitting function.

Each class performing the actions has a Log4Net ILog implementation injected in using dependency injection.p  pWhat I would like to do is every log entry to have the IP address of the caller so that I can track a call through or identify which call has errored on the server.p  pUsing log4Nets LogicalThreadContext, I have managed to achieve this for any log message written on the same thread but not for anything on other threads.p  pSample code below.p  pService Interfacep  precode    [ServiceContractNamespace  httptremac]     public interface IBroadcastService              [OperationContract]         void PublishMessageMessage message      codepre  pService Implementationp  precode[ServiceBehaviorInstanceContextMode  InstanceContextMode.Single] class BroadcastService IBroadcastService      private readonly ILog logger       public BroadcastServiceILog logger              logger  logger         logger.DebugBroadcast Service Initiated           public void PublishMessageMessage message                var prop                  OperationContext.Current.IncomingMessageProperties[RemoteEndpointMessageProperty.Name] as                     RemoteEndpointMessageProperty         string ip  prop  null    prop.Address          log4net.LogicalThreadContext.Properties[CallerIp]  ip          try                       logger.InfoPublishing message from   message.Sender             var sinks  ObjectFactory.GetAllInstancesltIMessageWriteRepositorygt             Parallel.ForEachsinks, x gt x.SaveMessagemessage             logger.InfoMessage published                  catch Exception ex                      logger.ErrorIssue publishing message from   message.Sender   on   ip, ex             throw new FaultExceptionMessage was either not published or only partially published.

Negative 26711 pThe DB that has been setup has ODBC connections restricted so that all users can connect, but only CNO users can actually do anything... even simple SELECT queries. However we now want to enable all users to connect via ODBC AND read data, but cant change the original CNO restriction. p  pThe reason for this is that the business now wants a packaged tool in Excel where users can read data from a large variety of preset queries... BUT only have the queries return data for those that have permissions to the tables in question.  ie for user A queries 115 might return data as the user has permissions to the underlying tables but not the rest. However, if we have to connect with a CNO account obviously that account will need to be able to read from ALL the tables as it wont always be user A using the tool, and another user might have different permissions.p  pWe could maintain a seperate permissions model in the tool... but that could get very messy, especially as we have 600 users at present... aweful idea IMOp  pWe could run permission queries on connection to ascertain what the user has permissions to and then include complicated WHERE clauses... but that is more open to error in terms of coding and getting it rightp  pWhat we would like to do is on the connection or session have the CNO account inherit the permissions of the user connecting so that we can keep ALL permissions managed in one place... ie Oracle. Obviously we would not want the permissions applied account wide as if we have multiple users connecting we want them to have their permissions and not someone elses who connected after etc...p  pIs this possiblep  pThanksp

Negative 26711 pI am working on adding Crystal Report 2013 support to an old ASP.NET 2.0 portal site that is developed using VS 2008. We already Crystal reports 2008 and XI but as part of our commitment to support Windows Server 2012 we need to be able to support Crystal Reports 2013. p  pWe have a base Crystal.Integration and a CrystalViewer project that contain some generic code for setting the connection details and creating a container that contains the ReportViewer component itself but then there are 3 projects for the version specific stuff. These contain the references for the appropriate DLLs and the code for building the viewer and showing the report itself.

Negative 26711 pIve gotten really closep  pIm working on an InfoPath form thats published to a SharePoint form library. That form contains a datetime field within a repeating group. Ive gotten feedback from users  the default InfoPath date amp time control with its textbox for entering time isnt great. Theyd like dropdowns to select preset times in increments, like in SharePoint forms.a hrefhttplh6.ggpht.comIvEa6jgN4TgQJpzNSLNIAAAAAAAAA0QFp2h5FaUgimagethumb25255B2425255D.pngimgmax800 relnofollowimg srchttplh6.ggpht.comIvEa6jgN4TgQJpzNSLNIAAAAAAAAA0QFp2h5FaUgimagethumb25255B2425255D.pngimgmax800 altExample of SharePoint date amp time fieldap  pMaking that swap is what Im trying to do. My solution needs to work for new forms and show the correct datetimes in forms that have already been submitted to the library. Keep in mind  the datetime is in a repeating section. Thats an unbreakable limitation.p  pstrongWhat Ive tried so farstrongp  pI created subfields for date, hour and minute increments. I made the existing datetime field default to the concatenation of those subfields, and update whenever theyre changed. This is the obvious way, and it didnt work  submitted forms lost the date theyd already chosen, because it was stored in the datetime and the subfields were blank.p  pIt took me a while, but I got something closer using rules. Put a rule on the datetime field to update the subfields when theyre blank. Put rules on the subfields to update just their specific part of the datetime field when theyre changed so changing hour from 02 to 03 would replace 20150924Tstrong02strong3000 with 20150924Tstrong03strong3000. I tested by setting the datetimes default value to different values, and the subfields updated correctly each time. Unfortunately this didnt work in production with existing forms. I believe the rule on the datetime isnt running, since it isnt being set to a value  even the default.p  pI thought about trying to use a form load rule to touch the datetime, thus kicking off the process, but I cant figure out how to touch each of the datetimes in the repeating section.p  pAny ideas on how to replace this date amp time control inplace, without forcing users to reset the time in every existing formp

Negative 26711 pThe code is written in Java 1.7p  pI want to make some major modifications to a binary file on a slow network.To protect against the network connection being lost instead of writing directly to the file I write to a new file. When I have completed writing to the new file I delete the old file and rename the new file to the old file.p  pMy question is is it better for the new file to be  1. On the same location as the original file  2. Locally on the computer p  pWith 1. writing to the file could be slower, but the rename should be quicker in fact with most oses would be immediate . With 2 writing to the file should be quicker but then renaming the filwe would be slower.p  pI feel the answer is 1.p  pActually if I open a Filechannel to both files and transfer files directly from one channel to another do the bytes have to come from network to my computer and back to network or can they been copied directly from one place on network to the the ther.p

Negative 26711 pI have an app, that checks a database of mac addresses against the ones the Bluetooth scanner can find currently in its vicinity, and if there is a match it basically just says it found someone. However this only works 1 out of 10 times. It finds devices fine, but the comparing fails, I think it is because of how java runs the code, and I do not know how to do it differently.
