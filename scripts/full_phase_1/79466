Im pretty sure I could refactor this by creating a new page url for each of the login functions  one controller per page  but that seems like a crude way to go.p  pThere is also a fireuser repo on github which seems to do what I need, but it is based on simple login, which is deprecated. I have not been able to find any info on how one might migrate from simple login to the latest firebase authentication  maybe this would be the easiest way to get going. p  pI will eventually need three different types of users all with different permissions on the site. They need to be able to access a different set of pages, and add different data to the DB.p  pAny suggestions welcome.p

Negative 79466 pProcessing an XML file with LINQ to add records into a table in a SQL Server database via a data context. As we are adding records we need to assign the parents in various other tables. Most of the time we can find the existing parent and use it but sometimes we will need to create a new parent. p  pThought we could do this like thisp  pre Dim defaultPub As publication defaultPub  New publication With .name  e..Value Dim pub  Data.publications.WhereFunctions s.name  e..Value.DefaultIfEmptydefaultPub.SingleOrDefault .publication  pub pre  pSo we are trying to find a publication that matches e..Value from our XML, but if we cant find one then we use defaultPub. If it does exist though we dont want to add it again. So maybe this approach is flawed anyway even if it did work...p  pAnyway its not currently working, we get this error Unsupported overload used for query operator DefaultIfEmpty.p  pThe overload requires a publication and is getting one Ive checked the TypeNames in quickwatch, dont know what is going on here. p  pWhat we are really looking for is something like the findorcreate from activerecord for Ruby that LINQ seems to be a copied from.p  pThanks in advance,p  pDave.p

Negative 79466 pIm compiling a custom kernel under Ubuntu and Im running into the problem that my kernel doesnt seem to know where to look for firmware.  Under Ubuntu 8.04, firmware is tied to kernel version the same way driver modules are.  For example, kernel 2.6.2424generic stores its kernel modules inp  precodelibmodules2.6.2424generic codepre  pand its firmware inp  precodelibfirmware2.6.2424generic codepre  pWhen I compile the 2.6.2424generic Ubuntu kernel according the a hrefhttpshelp.ubuntu.comcommunityKernelCompileAltBuildMethodAlternate Build Method The OldFashioned Debian Waya I get the appropriate modules directory and all my devices work except those requiring firmware such as my Intel wireless card ipw2200 module.p  pThe kernel log shows for example that when ipw2200 tries to load the firmware the kernel subsystem controlling the loading of firmware is unable to locate itp  precodeipw2200 Detected Intel PROWireless 2200BG Network Connection ipw2200 ipw2200bss.fw requestfirmware failed Reason 2 codepre  perrnobase.h defines this asp  precodedefine ENOENT       2   No such file or directory  codepre  pThe function returning ENOENT puts a minus in front of it.p  pI tried creating a symlink in libfirmware where my kernels name pointed to the 2.6.2424generic directory, however this resulted in the same error.

Up until version 92 of codeudevcode, the program a hrefhttpwww.redhat.comarchivesfedoracvscommits2005Julymsg00931.htmlcodefirmwarehelpercodea was the way firmware got loaded.  Starting with codeudevcode 93 this program was replaced with a script named firmware.sh providing identical functionality as far as I can tell.  Both of these hardcode the firmware path to codelibfirmwarecode.  Ubuntu still seems to be using the codelibudevfirmwarehelpercode binary.p  pThe name of the firmware file is passed to codefirmwarehelpercode in the environment variable codeFIRMWAREcode which is concatenated to the path codelibfirmwarecode and used to load the firmware.p  pThe actual request to load the firmware is made by the driver ipw2200 in my case via the system call p  precoderequestfirmware..., ipw2200bss.fw, ... codepre  pNow somewhere in between the driver calling coderequestfirmwarecode and codefirmwarehelpercode looking at the codeFIRMWAREcode environment variable, the kernel package name is getting prepended to the firmware name. p  pSo whos doing itp

Negative 79466 pI have written a DSL using Antlr to generate a lexer and parser from my grammar file.

Negative 79466 pDuring rebuild after a computer crash, I reinstalled Delphi 7, then Delphi 2007.  We skipped installation of Delphi 2006.  However, now I would like to install Delphi 2006 before Embarcadero discontinues allowing for download of the latest version of D2006.p  pIs it possible to install Delphi 2006 on this computer without having an adverse impact on the other two installationsp  pMy only concern is the potential problem of mixup in the SYSTEM PATH variable, where each version of Delphi uses the system PATH value to remember the location of the BPL files.  Then the system PATH statement holds multiple BPL path locations created by each Delphi installation.  However, each version Delphi only finds and uses the FIRST BPL path found in the list of paths  which always happens to be the most recent install.  Delphi installs insert  rather than append  the BPL path references at the beginning of the current system PATH value.  If this happens, then it is possible, for example, for Delphi 7 to reference the BPL files of Delphi 2007.  Of course, thats not good at all. This is something that I know how to work around  if it is the only issue.p  pIm hoping that the answer is not uninstall Delphi 2007 first.  That is painful for me as it takes significant time to reinstall all the addon components.p

Negative 79466 pCommonly, a website has a menu bar with links to different pages of the site Home, Page A, Page B, etc..p  pLets say you have a site with address ema hrefhttpwww.example.com relnofollowhttpwww.example.comaem. 99 when someone types that URL into their browser, they are directed to the page represented by Home. It usually has the optional extension of index[.html.php] e.g., ema hrefhttpwww.example.comindex.html relnofollowhttpwww.example.comindex.htmlaem. However, there are use cases where, depending from where a user is going to hit your website, that you want to redirect them to a different page. For example, if you have an ad on a site promoting your page, you might want to redirect them to ema hrefhttpwww.example.comcamefromad.html relnofollowhttpwww.example.comcamefromad.htmlaem which will look pretty much the same as your normal Home page, but maybe with a little added text specifying that they came from the page where the ad was on.p  pMy question isp  pIs there a way, after a user has landed on the site from a referred page, to use PHP to ensure that clicking the Home link will always go to ema hrefhttpwww.example.comcamefromad.html relnofollowhttpwww.example.comcamefromad.htmlaem emIFem the user landed there to begin with What I am trying to avoid is for a user to have come to ema hrefhttpwww.example.comcamefromad.html relnofollowhttpwww.example.comcamefromad.htmlaem and then click Home in the menu bar and end up at the default home page never to be able to return to the ema hrefhttpwww.example.comcamefromad.html relnofollowhttpwww.example.comcamefromad.htmlaem page I dont have that landing page enabled in the public menu since I dont want the general user to be able to go there.p  pThis is my first time using PHP and I am trying to piece it together using session state, etc., but I just havent quite completed the puzzle yet. Here is what I have in emindex.phpem which is the file that represents the Home linkp  precodelt sessionstart  SESSION[amSet] 0 gt  lt if SESSION[amSet]  0    if emptySERVER[HTTPREFERER]      referrer  SERVER[HTTPREFERER]     SESSION[amSet]  1     if pregmatchother.example.net,referrer     headerLocation httpexample.comcamefromad.html  gt codepre  pBasically, my thinking is to set a variable when the user comes to the site so that the referrer variable is set to that referring site. But if the user clicks around links in the site itself, I dont want the referrer reset. I want it to stay what it was when the user first came to the site, so if the user clicks on the Home link it will always refer the user to the appropriate page. Obviously, the code I have above is not working.p

Negative 79466 pSo Ive been tasked with creating a tool for our QA department that can read packets off the wire and reassemble the messages correctly they dont trust our logs... long story.p  pThe application whose communication Im attempting to listen in on is using .NETs TcpListener and TcpClient classes to communicate.  Intercepting the packets isnt a problem Im using a hrefhttpsourceforge.netprojectssharppcap relnofollowSharpPcapa. However, emcorrectlyem reassembling the packets into application level messages is proving slightly difficult.p  pSome packets have the end of one message and the beginning of the next message in them and I cant figure out how the NetworkStream object in .NET is able to tell where one application level message ends and the other begins.p  pI have been able to figure out that any packet that contains the end of an application level message will have the TCP header PSH Push flag turned on.  But I cant figure out how .NET knows where exactly the end of the message is inside that packet.p  pThe data of one packet might look likep  precodegtltMessagegtltMessagegtltHeader fromSystemhttpblah codepre  pHow does the stream know to only send up to the end of codeltMessagegtcode to the application and store the rest until the rest of the message is completep  pThere are no IP level flags set for fragmentation, and the .NET sockets have no knowledge of the application level protocol.  So I find this incredibly vexing.  Any insight would be appreciated.p

Negative 79466 pI have a html table in which each line codelttrgtcode represents a group of client computers. Each line can be expanded to show the clients belonging to the group. The codelttrgtcode containing the clients are always generated but hidden and showed when clicking the plus button at the beginning of each line.p  pThe clients themselves they are codeltdivgtcode can be dragged and dropped in another group as long as this group is already expanded. So far it works fine.p  pWhat I am trying to achieve now is that the client can be dragged to a collapsed group and after a second or so hovering the group it will be expanded and the client can be dropped amongst the other clients of the group.p  pI programmed the hover using the codeincode and codeoutcodeevents of the codedroppablecode and it expands the group all right, but and now it starts to be hard to explain with words  the behavior of the droppable the client is still as if the table line that appeared were not there  the codeincode codeoutcode and codedropcode events of the droppable are fired on the old position of the elements, and the codeincode codeoutcode and codedropcode events of the newly appeared codelttrgtcode are never fired.p  pIt looks as if JQuery memorizes the position, size etc. of the elements when the drag starts, and these values are not updated if there is a change in the DOM before the drop happens...p  pCan someone confirm this behavior is normal, or can it be caused by another problem in my own code  Any workaround p  pthe question is quite bloated already so I dont include any code but Ill gladly upload it if requiredp  pEdit  I cant add a picture since I am a new user but you can find one here  a hrefhttpimg69.imageshack.usimg6930920100413190123.png relnofollowhttpimg69.imageshack.usimg6930920100413190123.pngap  pVersions  JQuery is 1.3.2 and jqueryui is 1.7.2p

Negative 79466 pI have a program to which Im adding fullscreen postprocessing effects. I do not have the source for the program its proprietary, although a developer did send me a copy of the debug symbols, .map format. I have the code for the effects written and working, no problems. p  pMy issue now is linking the two. p  pIve tried two methods so farp  pUse Detours to modify the original programs import table. This works great and is guaranteed to be stable, but the users Ive talked to arent comfortable with it, it requires installation beyond extracting an archive, and theres some question if patching the program with Detours is valid under the terms of the EULA. So, that option is out.p  pThe other option is the traditional DLLreplacement. Ive wrapped OpenGL opengl32.dll, and I need the program to load my DLL instead of the system copy just drop it in the program folder with the right name, thats easy. p  pI then need my DLL to load the Cg framework and runtime which relies on OpenGL and a few other things. When Cg loads, it calls some of my functions, which call Cg functions, and I tend to get stack overflows and infinite loops. I need to be able to either include the Cg DLLs in a subdirectory and still use their functions not sure if its possible to have my DLLs import table point to a DLL in a subdirectory or I need to dynamically link them which Id rather not do, just to simplify the build process, something to force them to refer to the systems file not my custom replacement.p  pThe entire chain is Program loads DLL A named opengl32.dll. DLL A loads Cg.dll and dynamically links GetProcAddress to sysdiropengl32.dll. I now need Cg.dll to also refer to sysdiropengl32.dll, strongnotstrong DLL A.p  pHow would this be done strongEditstrong How would this be done emeasilyem without using GetProcAddress If nothing else works, Im willing to fall back to that, but Id rather not if at all possible.p  pstrongEdit2strong I just stumbled across the function SetDllDirectory in the MSDN docs on a totally unrelated search. At first glance, that looks like what I need. Is that right, or am I misjudging off to test it nowp  pstrongEdit3strong Ive solved this problem by doing thing a bit differently. Instead of dropping an OpenGL32.dll, Ive renamed my DLL to DInput.dll. Not only does it have the advantage of having to export one function instead of well over 120 for the program, Cg, and GLEW, I dont have to worry about functions running back in I can link to OpenGL as usual. To get into the calls I need to intercept, Im using Detours. All in all, it works much better. This question, though, is still an interesting problem and hopefully will be useful for anyone else trying to do crazy things in the future. Both the answers are good, so Im not sure yet which to pick...p

Negative 79466 pIm working on an enterprise application rewrite using Silverlight. The project is still in its early stages of development, but there is a heavy initial data load on the application start as it pulls several sets of business objects from the server. Some of these data sets are infrequently changed once theyre set up by the user like the list of all customized data types in use by the user.p  pIn these cases, the thought is to cache the data objects probably in a serialized form in Isolated Storage so theres no wait on an asynchronous call to the server to grab the data after the first application load.p  pI thought that Isolated Storage is meant to store configuration data such as user preferences, or to share across the inbrowser and outofbrowser version of an app...that it works a lot like a cookie store.p  pMy main concern is that Im unsure of how secure Isolated Storage is, and I dont trust caching application data in it. To be fair, the user would also have access to the Silverlight .xap file.p  pIs this an appropriate use for Isolated Storage, why or why notp

I thought codestdmovecode merely returns an rvalue reference.  But since in this example codervalcode is already an rvalue reference, the call to codestdmovecode should be superfluous.

Negative 79466 pIn the past I have used PCS to update Swing elements that displayed certain fields and everything worked as expected.

Data updates come in bunches a network packet containing new values for about 1,000 fields, and I was wondering what the proper way to handle something like this is.p  pMy main concern is that whenever a data packet comes, 1,000 PropertyChangeEvents are triggered, causing 1,000 .repaints or .revalidates or whatever.

Negative 79466 pFor a uni assignment I need to create a circular list of up to 10 file names, and then store these in a shared memory area, so that 2 child processes can readwrite to the list using a semaphore to control access.  Trouble is, that I am a total C novice and I feel loss and despair because its totally out of my depth.  I need some help in filling in the holes of my knowledge.p  pRight now, I am simply focussing on it one problem at a time, and presently, I am only trying to get my circular list into the shared memory area.p  pSo far I havep  precodetypedef struct FILE     struct FILE flink   forward link for linked list     char name[255]        name of the file    FILEentry codepre  pAs my struct which will hold the reference to the file that comes next flink. this way I can just call flink to get the next item in the list, and where the 10th element will simply have its flink directed back to the 1st.

How do I store my linked list INTO the shared memory area  and how do I access it FROM the shared memory areap

Negative 79466 pI have some fragments that need to show a regular dialog. On these dialogs the user can choose a yesno answer, and then the fragment should behave accordingly.p  pNow, the codeFragmentcode class doesnt have an codeonCreateDialogcode method to override, so I guess I have to implement the dialogs outside, in the containing codeActivitycode. Its ok, but then the codeActivitycode needs to report back the chosen answer somehow to the fragment. I could of course use a callback pattern here, so the fragment registers itself at the codeActivitycode with a listener class, and the Activity would report back the answer thru that, or something like that.p  pBut this seems to be quite a big mess for a simple task as displaying a damn yesno dialog in a fragment.

Negative 79466 pIm trying out Windows Phone 7 dev for the first time.  I decided to try and port a Silverlight Timer example from the default examples in Expression Blend 4.

Negative 79466 pIm writing an application that I will use to keep up with my monthly budget. This will be a C .NET 4.0 Winforms application.p  pEssentially my budget will be a matrix of data if you look at it visually. The columns are the dates at which that budget item will be spent. For example, I have 1 column for every Friday in the month. The Y axis is the name of the budget item Car payment, house payment, eating out, etc. There are also categories, which are used to group the budget item names that are similar. For example, a category called Housing would have budget items called Mortgage, Rent, Electricity, Home Insurance, etc.p  pI need a good way to store this data from a code design perspective. Basically Ive thought of two approachesp  pOne, I can have a BudgetItem class that has a Category, Value, and Date. I would have a linear list of these items and each time I wanted to find a value by either date or category, I iterate this list in some form or fashion to find the value. I could probably use LINQ for this.p  pSecond, I could use a 2D array which is indexed first by column date and second by row. Id have to maintain categories and budget item names in a separate list and join the data together when I do my lookups somehow.p  pWhat is the best way to store this data in code Im leaning more towards the first solution but I wanted to see what you guys think. Later on when I implement my data persistence, I want to be able to persist this data to SQL server emORem to an XML file one file per monthly budget.p  pThanksp

Negative 79466 pWith ARC, I can no longer cast codeCGColorRefcode to codeidcode. I learned that I need to do a bridged cast. According a hrefhttpclang.llvm.orgdocsAutomaticReferenceCounting.htmlobjects.operands.castsclang docsap  blockquote   pA strongbridged caststrong is a Cstyle cast annotated with one of three keywordsp      pcodebridge T opcode casts the operand to the destination type T. If T   is a retainable object pointer type, then op must have a   nonretainable pointer type. If T is a nonretainable pointer type,   then op must have a retainable object pointer type. Otherwise the cast   is illformed. There is no transfer of ownership, and ARC inserts no   retain operations.p      pcodebridgeretained Tcode op casts the operand, which must have   retainable object pointer type, to the destination type, which must be   a nonretainable pointer type. ARC retains the value, subject to the   usual optimizations on local values, and the recipient is responsible   for balancing that 1.p      pcodebridgetransfer Tcode op casts the operand, which must have   nonretainable pointer type, to the destination type, which must be a   retainable object pointer type.

Negative 79466 pI am looking for a solution that will allow me to print generic url for a set of pages. Example For pages  site.comAboutContact.aspx, site.comAboutWhoWeAre.aspx, site.comAboutMembers.aspx etc., user should see only site.comAbout in the address bar. Is that something achievable This site is not SEO friendly and requires users to login before accessing content, also I dont expect site.comAbout or any internal pages to resolve to any page when typed directly on browser. I am also fine if real url is printed on status bar if the user hovers on the internal links. I dont think URL Rewrite or URL Routing works here. Or may be I am missing something. Using .NET 3.5 and C. I am tagging sitecore because I am more interested in sitecore based solution where I have different nodes under About tree and I want users to see only upto About in the address bar, but I think if it can be done in asp.net, I can figure out sitecore part.p

Negative 79466 pIm trying to create a simple multiplayer game for Android devices. I have been thinking about the netcode and read now a lot of pages about Sockets. The Android application will only be a client and connect only to one server.p  pAlmost everywhere here too you get the recommendation to use NIO or a framework which uses NIO, because of the blocking.

I thought the read function will block my application and I couldnt do anything  but everything worked just fine. I have been thinking What if I just create a input and output buffer in my application and create two threads which will write and read to the socket from my two buffers Would this work If yes  why does everyone recommend NIO Somewhere in the normal IO way there must a block happen, but I cant find it.  Are there maybe any other benifits of using NIO for Android multiplayer gaming I thought that NIO seems to be more complex, therefore maybe less suited for a mobile device, but maybe the simple socket way is worse for a mobile device.p  pI would be very happy if someone could tell me where the problem happens.

Negative 79466 pWell i am currently trying to do a query in SQL, but i wanna to join 2 tables in the same query. Well im using this code in PHPp  precodeSELECT  FROM table1, table1 WHERE value1 LIKE q   OR value2 LIKE q   LIMIT 10 codepre  pTable1 and table2 are different tables, table1 doesnt have a value2 column and table2 doesnt have a value1 column.p  pMy idea is to check in PHP if the row has a specific column that only the table1 has then it will return the values of the columns that table1 has. And if it detects that the row has the table2 specific column, it will return the values of the columns that the table 2 has.p  pThere  is even a way to do thatp
Negative 79466 pI have a TreeView databound to a CollectionViewSource Groups collection.  This is so that I can display the data using the power of the CollectionViewSource, and the data itself also has a hierarchical structure, which is why I need the TreeView. I have a second control which is bound to the SelectedItem of the TreeView.p  pThe problem is that when the group header is selected, the program crashes with the following exception.p  precodeA TwoWay or OneWayToSource binding cannot work on the readonly property Name of type MS.Internal.Data.CollectionViewGroupInternal. codepre  pThe objects in my TreeView contain a Name property that is two way bound in another control.  The binding engine seems to find the Name property for the Group and attempt to bind to that.  How can I prevent this exception from occuring  I would like for the rest of my program to treat it as if nothing is selected when the group header is selected, or disallow selecting the group header all together.  Below is a simplified version of the code.p  precode        ltTreeView             xNameCustomersTree             ItemsSourceBinding CustomersViewSource.Groups             ItemTemplateStaticResource CustomerGroupsTemplategt          ltMyUserControl DataContextBinding ElementNameCustomersTree, PathSelectedItem, ModeOneWay gt  ltHierarchicalDataTemplate xKeyCustomerGroupsTemplate ItemsSourceBinding PathItems ItemTemplateStaticResource CustomerTreeItemTemplategt     ltTextBlock TextBinding PathNamegt ltHierarchicalDataTemplategt  ltHierarchicalDataTemplate xKeyCustomerTreeItemTemplate ItemsSourceBinding Customersgt     ltStackPanelgt         ltImage SourceBinding ImageSource gt         ltTextBlock TextBinding PathName gt     ltStackPanelgt ltHierarchicalDataTemplategt codepre  pTo be clear, the error is a result of the binding in the CustomerGroupsTemplate as far as I can tell, and changing this binding to OneWay results in the same error.  The information in the tree shows up the way it is expected to, it is only when a group header is selected that the exception occurs.p

This class contains a method UploadCustomerData that call the methods in dependencies as required.p  pHere is the codep  precodepublic class UploadFileViaFTP      private readonly IFtpOperation ftp     private readonly IDataltint, IListltCustomerDatagtgt customerData     private readonly IDataTransformltCustomerData, stringgt transformer     private readonly ISettings settings      public UploadFileViaFTPIFtpOperation ftp, IDataltint, IListltCustomerDatagtgt customerData,         IDataTransformltCustomerData, stringgt transformer, ISettings settings              ftp  ftp         transformer  transformer         customerData  customerData         settings  settings           public void WriteToDiskIListltCustomerDatagt customers, string localFilePath              using var writer  new StreamWriterlocalFilePath                      foreach var customer in customers                              writer.WriteLinetransformer.Transformcustomer                                 private void UploadCustomerDataint accountId              var customerData  customerData.GetDataaccountId         if customerData.Count gt 0                      var localPath  settings.GetValueltstringgtLocalFilePath             WriteToDiskcustomerData, localPath             ftp.UploadlocalPath                  else                      notificationMessage.AppendLine                 string.FormatThere could be an error or no data avaiable to upload at 0 for account 1., DateTime.Now, accountId                codepre  pNow my question is where does this class UploadFileViaFTP lives.

Negative 79466 pI have a repository that Im checking out from my SVN server onto Windows XP, and when it pulls down I dont have all the changes.  There are several partial change sets when I look over the incoming changes as well as some whole change sets that arent checked out.  I am pulling head so I should get all of the changes.  However, when I do an update on the project it still doesnt pull down the changes.  What the heck is going on here  Ive also noticed that once I check out the project I dont have any .svn directories.  Could the .svn directories be stored somewhere else so when I do a full checkout its using those folders or cached information causing the partial checkoutsp

Negative 79466 pIm writing an music player app. I have the MediaPlayer object in a service. The problem is that I dont know how to update the UI from service. By example I want to update the remaining time from current song but  because the MediaPlayer is on service   I cant set a listener to MediaPlayer object. p  pI was thinking about sending a broadcast message with current time but if Ill do it in this way, I have to send a message on every second. I suppose this will affect the speed of application  battery life. p  pAnother solution can be to create a codepublic staticcode variable in Service and access it from activity but I read that this is not a good option.p  pWhat do you think Do you know any  better  way to update the UI from servicep  pThank you.p

Negative 79466 pI have an input box. When the input box is clicked, all items from the autocomplete source are displayed. When the user selects one item the input box is properly populated. Everything works fine... Nevertheless I am trying to have something more and I do not manage to see how to do it. I would like this first input box not to be editable by the user. Currently it is possible for him to enter manually a value. If I put readonly in my css, the input is not anymore clickable.... So I do not see how to do it. Oh by the way, in do not want to use a combo box. The input has to stay an input. Thank you very much in advance for the replies. Cheers.

Negative 79466 pI am working on an update to an application that uses DAO to access an SQL Server.  I know, but lets consider DAO a requirement for now.p  pThe application runs all the time in the system tray and periodically performs SQL server operations.  Since it is running all the time, and users of the application will be on laptops and transitioning between buildings, Ive designed it to quietly transition between active and inactive states.  When the database connection is successful operations resume.p  pI have one last issue before I release this update  When a connection is dropped, then reestablished, the SQL operations fail.  This occurs only if I have specified the hostname in my connection string.  If I use the IP, everything is fine but I need to be able to use hostname.p  pHere is the behaviorp  p1  Everything working.  Good network connection, database operations are fine.p  p2  Lost connection.  Little x appears on task bar icon, and nothing else.  All ok.p  p3  Reconnect.  p  pAt step 3, I get an ODBCcall failed error when I run the first query.  Interestingly, the database is first opened without error.p  pIf I skip step 1, and start the application when the connection is down, everything works fine in step 3, hostname or not.p  pI expect this is an issue with the DAO engine caching the DNS entry after the first connection, although the destination IP does not change so Im not sure about that.  I have tried flushing the windows DNS cache from cmd prompt to no effect.  The same behavior occurs even when Im using my local hostname with a local SQL server I set up for development.  127.0.0.1 has no problems.p  pI also tried to CoUninitialize the DAO interface between active times, but I had trouble getting this to work.  If someone thinks that would help I will work harder at it.p  pThis behavior is the same in Windows XP or 7.p  pThanks for anything youve gotp  pEdit  I should have mentioned  I am closing the database connection between the attempts, then reopening it with p  precodempDb  mpDaoEnginegtOpenDatabase codepre

So with the above classes I can easily get all messages that the user has sent. E.g. p  precodemessageRepository.GetMessagesFromUserByUserIDGuid.Parseid.ToList  public IEnumerableltMessagegt GetMessagesFromUserByUserIDGuid userID                      return context.Messages.Wherex gt x.SenderID  userID.ToList          codepre  pThis is all fine. The problem is that I would like to use the Sender navigational property to get the senders name, so when the client gets the messages they can see who they are from.p  pI could use my user repository, look up the User by UserID and combine the two results  but this seems counter intuitive.p  pFinally I apologies for not being able to phrase this in a concise way and hope the extra info helps.p  pUpdate 2p  pI have tried to use the Sender property eg. codeSender.Namecode however I recieve an error. I went to look in the DB and found  this is what is being produced. Please ignore the fact that the Guids are the same.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comNg7fm.png altDatabase Imagep
Negative 79466 pIve registered a domain with www.domain101.com. Well call it www.example.com. I used their cloaked forwarding option on my heroku app, which well call example.herokuapp.com. If I want to navigate to the posts index page, I would go to example.herokuapp.composts, of course however, when I try this with my cloaked domain  www.example.composts  it takes me to the landing page. Whats more, the url is constantly set to www.example.com and the title of each page is EXAMPLE.COM. I can click buttons on the pages and navigate through my website, but the url remains strictly at www.example.com.p  pI used the forwarding option available on the website.

Negative 79466 pI want to write a function which will be repeatedly called by other functions many times. Inside this function it is supposed to generate a lot of random numbers and this part will be treated in parallel. If only for one run, the seed can be chosen differently for each thread, so that the random numbers will be uncorrelated. However, if this function will be called the 2nd time, it seems that the random numbers will repeat unless the seed will be again changed during the later calls. p  pSo my question is, is there a good way to generate the random numbers or reset the seed so that the random numbers generated by repeated calls to this function and also by different threads are really random p  pI need to do this in openMP. Is it possible to store the state of the generator for each thread separately after each call of the function, so that when the next time the function is called, the random number generator start from the last state and continue to generate uncorrelated numbersp  pThank you. p
Negative 79466 pI am trying to get started with modifying open source software. The current one I am looking to play around with is QEMU.

Negative 79466 pI am running a xampp server and connecting to the mysql database. Im writing some php to interface with the database. The database is mainly going to be used locally, so the problem then becomes if someone accesses the database locally, they can simply open up the php file and find the mysql login information. Is there a way to secure this information Can I create a user who only has access to view the table, and then when someoene tries to edit, I can prompt for another passwordp  pIm not sure if this makes sense, but essentially I do not want someone to locally be able to see the mysql password that is stored in the mysqlconnect.

Negative 79466 pI have written a simple Google Apps Spreadsheet script that takes details in some rows and converts them to a single list all quite straightforward. The issue is that the script keeps stopping at random points, and the loop never finishes  there is no error message, and the message at the top of the script editor still indicates it is running, when it has clearly stopped.p  pI initially thought maybe it was being throttled somehow, but the random stopping points sometimes at source sheet row 6x, sometimes at 7x, sometimes well into the hundreds and the lack of an error message suggests otherwise.p  pCan anyone assist me in working out why this is happening Is it because I am running it from the script editor window Are there any other reasons network issues, maybe that an apps script could stop running, and if so, can it be run in background or similar to prevent thisp  pThanksp  pprecodefunction convertTrimsToList   var ss  SpreadsheetApp.openById[REDACTED]   var sheet  ss.getSheets[0]   var newss  SpreadsheetApp.createMMT List   var newsheet  newss.getSheets[0]p  px  1   z  1   i  1   q  1   while sheet.getRangex,1.getValue          sheet.getRange1,6.setValueProcessing row   x     y  5     while sheet.getRangex,y.getValue              sheet.getRange1,7.setValueProcessing row   y       if x  1                 if y  5 ampamp sheet.getRangex,1.getValue  sheet.getRangex1,1.getValue                    i                        newsheet.getRangez,1.setValuei       newsheet.getRangez,2.setValueq       newsheet.getRangez,3.setValuesheet.getRangex,y.getValue       z       y          if x  1                if sheet.getRangex,3.getValue  sheet.getRangex1,3.getValue                    q                     else            q          x    precodep

and an essentially empty SOAP body  there is no attached payload XML document.p  pMy Ping program is going through the following steps sorry there is so much of itp  ol liIt creates an XML document an objectli liTo that it adds as the DOM root a SOAP envelopeli liTo the soap envelope it adds a SOAP headerli liTo the SOAP header it adds an ebXML message headerli liIt fills in the various details of the message headerli liIt then adds a SOAP body to the SOAP envelope, containing essentially nothing but hey its mandatory li liAt this point, prior to adding the Signature element to the SOAP Header, it writes the XML object to a file on disk.li liIt then runs an external program called a hrefhttpxmlsoft.orgxmllint.html relnofollowxmllinta with its c14n flag set telling it to a hrefhttpwww.w3.orgTRxmlc14n relnofollowcanonicaizea its input, passing in the file the XML was written to and placing the output in another fileli liThat output file is then read back into the program as a stringli liThat string is then hashed using SHA1 hashing via calls to the Windows Crypto API, returning a hashed digest 20 byes long, which is then base64 encoded to yield a 28 byte string the last byte being the  paddingli liIt then adds a Signature element to the SOAP headerli liIt then adds a SignedInfo element to the Signature, then a Reference element to thatli liIt adds a Transforms element to the Reference and a bunch of Transform elements to thatli liIt adds DigestMethod and DigestValue elements to the Reference, with the DigestValue having the earlierderived base64 encoded hash string as its contentli liIt then writes the SignedInfo XML content to a disk file and does the same canonicalization process using xmllint as before on that, reading the output back into a stringli liIt then signs that string using a rather convoluted series of operations involving a number of ActiveX objects from Chilkat, as followsli liIt loads the certificate using its Common Name into a ChilkatCert objectli liIt then exports the private key of that cert object to a PEM string GetPrivateKeyPem methodli liIt then loads that string into a PrivateKey object, using the private keys password LoadEncryptedPem methodli liIt then exports the private keys XML to a string GetXML methodli liIt then imports that XML string into a ChilkatRsa object ImportPrivateKey methodli liIt then uses that RSA object to sign the canonicalized SignedInfo string I have many different options here, but have so far found most success with the SignStringENC method, passing it the string and SHA1, having first set the RSA objects LittleEndian property to zeroli liThe resulting base64 string is then added to the Signature element as the content of a SignatureValue elementli liIt then once again loads the certificate into the ChilkatCert object using Common Name LoadByCommonName method and exports it in DER format to a variant ExportCertDER method which contains a byte array which it builds up into a string, which it then base64 encodesli liIt adds a KeyInfo element to the Signature element, adds an X509Data element to that and finally adds an X509Certificate element to that with the base64 encoded certificate string as its contentli liIt then writes the whole XML out to a disk file, writes the part boundary and MIME header to another file, appends the XML file using the DOS copy file1file2 file3 mechanism, finally appending the terminal part boundaryli liThe resulting file is then sent via HTTP Post to the target systemli liWe get back nothing in the HTTP response body and an HTTP status of 204li ol  pThe result I get back into a different program  this is asynchronous messaging after all as a nice bit of SOAPebXML including the slightly unhelpful message that there is an

Negative 79466 pI am just starting to look at Zend Framework 2 and am new to ZF in general, and in the a hrefhttpframework.zend.commanual2.0enuserguidemodules.htmluser guidea, they are using autoloading when adding a new module. However, I find the explanation to be quite challenging for a rookie. They are adding a codeModule.phpcode file within the module directory, which among others contains the following codep  precodepublic function getAutoloaderConfig              return array             ZendLoaderClassMapAutoloader gt array                 DIR . autoloadclassmap.php,             ,             ZendLoaderStandardAutoloader gt array                 namespaces gt array                     NAMESPACE gt DIR . src . NAMESPACE,                 ,             ,               codepre  pNow I did some digging around to try and figure out what this autoloading is all about. As far as I understand, the autoloading uses codesplautoloadregistercode and is a way to avoid having coderequireoncecode everywhere in the code. So, when trying to use a class that is not defined, the codeautoloadcode method that was registered will be run, which simply does an array lookup and includes the file like below if it was added.p  precode ZendLoaderClassMapAutoloader.php public function autoloadclass      if issetthisgtmap[class]          requireonce thisgtmap[class]       codepre  pThis seems clever due to performance. I hope what I just wrote is correct. Based on this, I am trying to figure out what is going on in codegetAutoloaderConfigcode from the first code snippet, but I am quite confused. It seems as if the array that is returned by this method is used for codeAutoloaderFactoryfactorycode, but I am not sure for what purpose. Instantiating autoloaders with options it seems, but exactly what that does, I am not sure. I guess the second entry of the array specifies where to find the source files for the modules namespace  at least that would be my guess. The first entry I am, however, not sure about. In the user guide, it says the followingp  blockquote   pAs we are in development, we dont need to load les via the classmap,   so we provide an empty array for the classmap autoloader.p blockquote  pThe file just returns an empty array. I am not sure what the purpose of this ClassMapAutoloader.p  pSorry if my point is unclear basically I am trying to figure out what is happening in codegetAutoloaderConfigcode and what codemymoduleautoloadclassmap.phpcode is used for. If someone could shed some light on this, that would be much appreciatedp

Negative 79466 pIn my application I am using Spring MVC with a JavaScript client. Now comes the time when I need to add a 4eyes validation form to my app. That is, a second physical person would have to come by and key in his username and password to validate a sensitive data update of some sort. The system will then check the username and the pwd of that person against an entreprise LDAP and then return successs or failure. If the authentication of that person fails, the system will inform the user that the deletionaddition is not possible. If that succeeds, the system will perform the update.p  pMy question is, since all the services are RESTful, how could I implement such a solution the safest way Ive heard that encrypting the password using a JavaScript API and sending it over the wire should be avoided at all cost as any maninthemiddle attack could wreak havocs.  I wouldnt want to use HTTPS either which would only serve that forms purpose which represents a tiny 1 of my app. Should I go for Spring Security If so how could I integrate a Spring Security web form inside a JavaScript framework Any thoughts or experience would be more than welcome.p  pBest, Jimmyp

Negative 79466 pAccording to Veraticuss answer on this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13197863webapplicationwithoutsqlqueryforcurrentuserauthenticationquestiona, Web authentication framework are saving the ID of the currentuser in a emsession idem in order to quickly and easily retrieve the user from the database without fetching the user each time with a new query on the database.p  pThis is great because its exactly what I want to do with my own server for performance reasons, through its API which Im writing.p  pBut I wondering about emsession idem... I mean, if the server handle sessions, the client have to provide to him a emsession idem.p  pHowever, Im also wondering about another thing in general, Web API are using an emAPI keyem for instance, a hrefhttpsapidocs.heroku.com relnofollowhttpsapidocs.heroku.coma. And using an emAPI keyem and a emsession idem may be complicated for the client...p  pI hope Heroku dont perfom a database query with the received authtoken at each HTTP request. But if they dont, how could they do to authenticate a user without its emsession idemp  pIm confused. Thank you a lot for any ideas.p

Negative 79466 pOk its a little hard to explain in a single title but basically I have a dynamic class added to a child element based on its parents dynamic class. Added sop  precodeul.eachfunctionkey     if this.hasClasssortable         this.addClassparent  key         this.children.addClassparent  key       codepre  pThe structure is pretty simple after thisp  precodeltul classparent0gt     ltli classparent0gt         ltul classparent1gt             ltli classparent1gtltligt         ltulgt     ltligt ltulgt codepre  pNow the UI has the user move these li outside of the parent and placed elsewhere. Later on, I want to check the element and then match it to its corresponding original parent. It cant be this parent because it will be moved out of the parent but the classes still remain.p  pSo the check is looking for .parentn and then finding the ul with .parentn eventually this code will live insidep  precodesortable li.appendToTHISISTHEDYNAMICCLASS codepre  pSo Im assuming the find will be before this but I dont know how to write that.p

Negative 79466 pI am trying to validate data integrity via the special validation event. My PhalconMvcCollection model implements the validation method with some PhalconMvcModelValidator validators.

I have a singleton class which is used both in the app and also in some services started from my app. So the codeAsyncTaskcode code I showed above can be run either from the activity assuming the singleton is accessed via the activity, or from the service if the singleton is accessed via service.p  pNow in API 11, no matter how the singleton is accessed, the codeonPostExecutecode is called just fine. On API 10 and below, if the singleton is accessed from the activity, then codeonPostExecutecode is called just fine, but if its accessed via service, codeonPostExecutecode is not called.p  pHere is more details about where it get stuck. codeAsyncTaskcode on 2.3 has an codeFutureTaskcode which overrides codedonecode function to send a codeMessagecode to its internal codeHandlercode as followp  precode        mFuture  new FutureTaskltResultgtmWorker          Override         protected void done              Message message             Result result  null              try                  result  get              catch final InterruptedException e                  android.util.Log.wAsyncTask.LOGTAG, e              catch final ExecutionException e                  throw new RuntimeExceptionAn error occured while executing doInBackground,                         e.getCause              catch final CancellationException e                  message  AsyncTask.sHandler.obtainMessageAsyncTask.MESSAGEPOSTCANCEL,                         new AsyncTaskResultltResultgtAsyncTask.this, Result[] null                 message.sendToTarget                 return              catch final Throwable t                  throw new RuntimeExceptionAn error occured while executing                           doInBackground, t                           message  AsyncTask.sHandler.obtainMessageAsyncTask.MESSAGEPOSTRESULT, new AsyncTaskResultltResultgtAsyncTask.this, result             message.sendToTarget               codepre  pThe last two lines of the following code calls codemessage.sendToTargetcode which is supposed to call codehandleMessagecode of the codeHandlercode class, but it does not now I have no idea why the callback to the handler happens from an activity and not from a service I have some solutions how to solve this simply using AsyncTask class for API15 in my code at all times, but any explanation about the cause of this would be very much appreciated as I have no knowledge on thisp  pThanksp
Negative 79466 pBecause hex is often used to represent things like RGBA color model data, Im trying to find out how to go about taking a large emhex stringem like 0x11AA22BB and split it into separate bytes. So 0x11, 0xAA, 0x22, and 0xBB chunks, essentially... I know that each hex digit can be directly represented by four bits. But breaking up a chain of bits into smaller groups isnt something that I know how to do, either.p  pSo, Im sure that there is probably a simple answer to this. Im sure it probably has something to do with casting it to an array of single bytes, or using bitwise operators or something, but I cant figure it out. I know that there is also an issue of endianness and how the bytes are organizes RGBA, ARBG, ABGR, etc., but right now Im just looking to understand how to do the splitting so I can get a general understanding of how it works. Im using C but I think that this might not necessarily be specific to that language.p  pSo, to reiterate emHow does one take a large hex string like 0x11AA22BB and split it into 0x11, 0xAA, 0x22, 0xBBemp

Negative 79466 pI have an issue in my multitiered application where I have detached my objects from the Session.  I have a user edit via the GUI the properties of a parent object along with adding, editing, and removal of child objects collection within the parent.  I am cascading all including orphaned deletes between the parent object and its children.p  pUpon associating the objects with a Session saveOrUpdate etc. the inserts and deletes are occurring but the order in which it occurs violates a unique constraint of the business natural key of the child object if the user of the GUI deletes and then adds back in the same business key.p  pAfter consulting the book Hibernate in Action and also the online reference pages  I still could not seem to find a definitive answer to the problem of unique constraints being violated when an item has been removed and then added back into a collection of children of a parent object. p  pHibernate never issues the deletes before the inserts as per the lines from Hibernate documentation as belowp  pThe documentation states the following ordering on a call to flush p  ol liall entity insertions in the same order as the Save was called on them li liall entity updates li liall collection deletions li liall collection element deletions, updates and insertions li liall collection insertions li liall entity deletions in the same order as the delete was called. li ol  pImplies the order as being deletions, updates and insertions or is the documentation not strictly specifying an order here p  pHibernate appears not to match this order as inserts are occurring before deletes for my collection elements.  If Hibernate always issues the inserts first then what is the recommended solution to this problem  Do we have to step out of the Hibernate world and handle this relationship ourselves p  pIf so, then fine, but I really do not want to have to code around this if there is a  solution available in Hibernate. p  pIf I have a table with a surrogate primary key for the  AND a unique constraint  on another columns can I get Hibernate to honour the unique constraint when it calls flush by tweaking attributes in the mapping file p  pFrom the online reference documentation  Hibernate however doesnt have enough information to correctly arrange SQL INSERT and UPDATE statements to avoid constraint violations, and needs some p  phelp to handle bidirectional associations properly. Making one side of the association inverse tells Hibernate to basically ignore it, to consider it a mirror of the other side. Thats all that is necessary for Hibernate to work out all of the issues when transformation a directional navigation model to a SQL database schema. p

Negative 79466 pA C MVC framework Im writing makes heavy use of the observer pattern. I have had a thorough read of the related chapter in Design Patterns GoF, 1995 and had a look at a multitude of implementations in articles and existing libraries including Boost.p  pBut as I was implementing the pattern, I could not help the feeling that there must be a better way  my client code involved lines and snippets that I felt should have been refactored into the pattern itself, if only I could find a way to overcome a few C limitations.

Negative 79466 blockquote   pFirst I should clarify that this post is not intended to criticize CDI, but to discover the thinking and assumptions behind the design of CDI and that will have obvious influence on designing any web app, which uses CDI.p blockquote  pOne of the most distinguished feature of CDI of Java EE 6 is strongtype safetystrong. Jboss Seam was not safe in type. It uses name to qualify any instance to inject. Like bellowp  precode   NamemyBean    public class MyBean implements Bean       ...         NameyourBean    public class YourBean implements Bean       ...     codepre  pWhile injecting MyBean one can do this p  precode   In    private Bean myBean myBean is injected     In    private Bean yourBean yourBean is injected   codepre  pAnd earlier versions of Spring before 3.0, this type of injection happened like bellowp  pJust define the beans in bean configuration filep  precode   ltbean idmyBean classcom.example.common.MyBeangt        ...    ltbeangt     ltbean idyourBean classcom.example.common.YourBeangt        ...    ltbeangt codepre  pAnd use named qualifier, deciding which one to usep  precode   Autowired    QualifiermyBean    private Bean bean     Autowired    QualifieryourBean    private Bean bean  codepre  pBut now in CDI, First you need to define a custom codeQualifiercode annotation for any specific type of object. Then use that annotation for qualifying that object. At the end of the day, when you look at your source code, you see that, you wasted considerable amount of time to write lots of custom annotations for dependency injection. Java community is moving towards annotations, leaving XML based configurations strongverbose XMLstrong behind. Is there anything that would convince anyone to think this type safety with custom annotations not as strongverbose annotationsstrong, but as an excellent and distinguished feature of CDI p  pstrongEditstrongp  pemstrongPoints, pushed to be highlightedemstrongp  ol liIf I use custom qualifier for type safety per service or dao per interface, then for a large sized application like having 1000 or more service or dao classes with multiple implementations, it will be messy. Then for large sized applications, Is that feasible to use type safe injectionli liIf the answer of the above question is No then, what is the point to use type safetyli liEven if it is feasible to write annotations for type safety, in large applications, is it really worth the effort for just avoiding strongverbose xmlstrong configurationli liWhen actually I need type safety instead of bean name qualifierli ol  pemstrongShort discussion on the above pointsemstrongp  ol liThere are not too many cases when you actually need type safe injection, specially when you have one implementation of an interface, you should use codeNamecode as the qualifier. So yes, in a large sized application it is feasible to use type safety when it is actually needed.li liOfcourse type safety is one of the distinguished feature of CDI and in the accepted answer there is a nonexhaustive list of reasons why you may chose to use type safety.li liAs you are an intelligent programmer and you know precisely when to use type safety, so definitely it worth the effort, when really needed.li liMost of the parts of the accepted answer really talks, when do we need type safety and a hrefhttpjava.dzone.comarticlescdidip1this articlea is also very helpful to understand.li ol  pThanks and happy codingp

Negative 79466 pIve been having a bit of a problem lately. Ive been trying to extract one zip file into a memory stream and then from that stream, use the codeupdateEntrycode method to add it to the destination zip file.p  pThe problem is, when the file in the stream is being put into the destination zip, it works if the file is not already in the zip. If there is a file with the same name, it does not overwrite correctly. It says on the dotnetzip docs that this method will overwrite files that are present in the zip with the same name but it does not seem to work. It will write correctly but when I go to check the zip, the files that are supposed to be overwritten have a compressed byte size of 0 meaning something went wrong. p  pIm attaching my code below to show you what Im doingp  precodeZipFile zipnew  new ZipFileforgeFile ZipFile zipold  new ZipFilezFile  usingzipnew      foreachZipEntry zenew in zipnew          percent  current  zipnew.Count  100         string flna  zenew.FileName         var fstream  new MemoryStream          zenew.Extractfstream         fstream.Seek0, SeekOrigin.Begin          usingzipold              var zn  zipold.UpdateEntryflna, fstream             zipold.Save             fstream.Dispose                  current          zipnew.Dispose  codepre
Negative 79466 pIs there a way to detect when the keyboard is about to be presented in Androidp  pMy problem is that I have a ListView with EditTexts in it.  When the keyboard is about to be presented, these are quite often redrawn, causing an EditText that was JUST tapped to lose focus and require an extra tap.p  pMy proposed solution is to monitor when the keyboard is about to be shown, check to see which view currently has focus, then after the keyboard is done being shown, restore focus to that view.p  pHowever, I have no idea how to detect when the keyboard is about to be shown in Android.  How would I do thisp  pI would also accept an alternative answer that addresses my actual problem EditText losing focus when keyboard is displayedp

Negative 79466 pIm embedding a codeJFileChoosercode in my program in my own frame with other custom components in the frame.  Heres a design of my app as it may help visualize my issuesp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.compNE0k.png altHow Im using JFileChooserp  pIf you cant tell, the lists directly under the codeJFramecode titles are codeJFileChooserscode.  The way this is supposed to work is you assign shortcuts to destinations and then when you press those shortcut keys, the selected file moves to the destination.p  pMy strategy for doing this is to assign the shortcut to a codejavax.swing.JComponent.WHENINFOCUSEDWINDOWcode scope of the codeInputMapcode of the entire frame.  p  pBut whats annoying is that something I assume the codeJFileChoosercode keeps on respondingabsorbing key presses I dont want it to.  For example, if I press codeCtrlCcode my shortcut action doesnt get run.  Ive tried this with the native Look and Feel Im using windows 7 and the default LampF and both situations have the same problem.  I think it might be trying to do a copy action of the selected file in the codeJFileChoosercode because if I click on one of the buttons to force it to lose focus, all the sudden my codeCtrlCcode command does emmyem action.  p  pBut, Im not really sure how the codeJFileChoosercode is doing this.  When I call codegetKeyListenerscode on it, it returns an empty array.  Ive also tried clearing its input map for this key combination at all three scopes, and it still seems to be absorbing the keypress.p  pCan anyone give me some sample code that makes the codeJFileChoosercode ignore codeCtrlCcode  Also, itd be helpful if someone could tell me how to debug problems like this in the future.  p  hr  pHere is some code of what Ive tried so far.

Negative 79466 pShort story I have a CDI codeSessionScopedcode bean annotation from codejavax.enterprise.contextcode and not from codejavax.facescode called codeUserContextBeancode. Id like to actually do something when an HTTP session is created. p  pSo naturally I assumed that codePostConstructcode would do the trick get called only once when an instance of this bean is constructed. However, as per the documentation a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavaee6tutorialdocgmgkd.html relnofollowherea, they say that the PostConstruct method is called p  blockquote   pWhen the managed bean is injected into a component, CDI calls the   method after all injection has occurred and after all initializers   have been called.p blockquote  pI had assumed that the post construct method would be called once, per session. However, practice is consistent with the documentation. This bean is injected into a codeRequestScopedcode bean also CDI which serves as a backing bean for a JSF page and the PostConstruct method is called strongfor every requeststrong. p  pI realize now that this is the behavior.

Also, a codemvn clean packagecode builds just fine.p  pHowever, when I add a plugin which needs codeca.odell.glazedlistscode which is also in my target definition I can still run it from within the IDE, but the codemvn clean packagecode build fails.  Any ideas what to do  Maven output and pom.xml follow.p  h2Maven outputh2  pre classlangnone prettyprintoverridecode[INFO] Computing target platform for MavenProject lumomicrosoftsqlserver0.0.1SNAPSHOT  DJava7lumoE4Workspacemicrosoftsqlserverpom.xml [INFO] Fetching p2.index from httpdownload.eclipse.orgreleaseskepler 0B at 0Bs [INFO] Fetching p2.index from httpdownload.eclipse.orgreleaseskepler 128B at 0Bs [INFO] 1 operation remaining.

Negative 79466 pI am writing a console application that searches through the current users outlook inbox.  The program performs certain actions on each email based on the subject line and then moves the email to 1 of 3 subfolders.  So far it has been running without throwing any errors.  The problem is that it will skip over some of the emails in the inbox and I cant seem to find any logic behind why it does this.  Sometimes it will skip the first email received, sometimes the last, other times it will leave 2 and move the rest.  Ive inserted a breakpoint in my code and stepped through each line and the skipped emails never show up.  It doesnt seem to matter whether the emails are marked read or unread either.  If I run the program multiple times then eventually the skipped emails are processed.

Negative 79466 pFor the life of me, I cannot figure out my my program is parsing out and not compiling. All my brackets seem on point. Thanksp  pMy task at hand isp  blockquote   pYou are required to write a C program that accepts two decimal integers, say d and r. You   may assume that the rst decimal integer d is nonnegative and that the second decimal integer r   which represents the radix, will be one of 2, 3, 4,   , 15, 16. The program should convert the rst   decimal integer d into its representation in radix r and print the result.   Examples   i Suppose the rst decimal integer is 138 and the second decimal integer is 16. In this case,   the output produced by your program should be 8A, which is the hexadecimal radix 16   representation of the decimal integer 138.   ii Suppose the rst decimal integer is 284 and the second decimal integer is 13. In this case, the   output produced by your program should be 18B, which is the radix 13 representation of the   decimal integer 284. In base 13, the digits used are 0, 1, 2,   , 9, A, B and C, where A, B   and C represent 10, 11 and 12 respectively.   Your program should be written so that it handles just one pair of integers. Thus, the outline for   your program is as follows. Note that no error checks are needed.   1. Prompt the user to type two decimal integers.   2. Read the two integers.   13. Convert the rst integer into its representation in the radix specied by the second integer.   4. Print the representation and stop.   Your program must read the two integers from stdin and write the answer to stdout. You   may assume that when prompted, the user will type two integers separated by one or more spaces.   Note Recall that for any radix r  2, the digits to be used are 0, 1,   , r  1. Use the letters A,   B, C, D, E and F to represent 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 respectively, as done in the hexadecimal   system. Thus, representations in radix 11 can use the digits 0, 1,   , 9, A representations in radix   12 can use 0, 1,   , 9, A, B, and so on.

In such a scenario I have tried to achieve locking on file when one thread is writing to it. Since the threads are of same process so codeflockcode cant simply lock the file, hence codemutexcode is used.p  precodeLogging function void writetofileint opfd,char name     flockopfd,LOCKEX    pthreadmutexlockampflck       writeopfd,name,20    pthreadmutexunlockampflck    flockopfd,LOCKUN   Client thread function  void clntthreadvoid  arg    int thisfdint arg   str is a continuous memory array of the size of the datcom struct.This will be filled up initially on receive as a normal array    , but then itll typecasted to point to struct datcom object   char str[sizeofdatcom],strsend[25]    memsetampstr,0,sizeofstr   datcom incmdat     struct to contain the incoming data from client .    while1      readthisfd,str,sizeofstr   typecast to struct datcom so that it is ready to be inserted into linked list or file.   incmdatdatcom ampstr     ifstrncmpstr,quit,40     break    Call write to file function   writetofileofd,incmdatgtname   fprintfstderr,Client said s,incmdatgtname    client wants to close connection    sprintfstrsend,s,incmdatgtname   sendthisfd,strsend,sizeofincmdatgtname,MSGNOSIGNAL    closethisfd return 0  codepre  pThis is working as expected at the moment. Is this a good practice to lock this way or is there any other best practice If I have to put this code on production what changes Id need to make that are not standard practice I understand this should ideally be on codecodereviewcode site,so Ive already posted it there 3 days back but havent got any comments.p

Negative 79466 pGroovyGrails has a very neat feature called dynamic finders as a part of GORM, implemented using phantom methods, where it uses a dynamic message interceptor to field messages to an object, and if the name is not a current actual methods, but matches a specific format of field  comparator it will synthesize a filter predicate method of that logic. Groovy has a special support for this in a MethodMissing method, and GrailsGORM adds this synthesized finder logic using that hook.p  pFor example, one can do something like thisp  precode   students.gpaLessThan3.0.nameLikeSmith.stateEqualsIowa codepre  pand get a filtered result from a collection, and none of these methods are user written.p  pIt seems that one could do something similar parallel in Java, using a dynamic proxy for the message interceptor and synthesis. I was going to play with this, but wonder if anyone else has already done something like this. Further I wonder if using annotations one could implement some static type checking on such synthesized names, since the annotation could at least generate code with method references, which the compiler would then check.p  p[I am not a Groovy user, but just read some samples of this feature, so I may have not been correct on the Groovy implementation details.]p

So If we try to call kernel after the memcpy, the kernel may or may not get valid data.p  pIf we do map and unmap operation inside the profiling loop, I think we can call kernel safely after the unmap operation, because this operation guarantees data has been in device safely. The new code is given herep  precode copy data from host to device by memcpy forunsigned int i  0 i lt MEMCOPYITERATIONS i       get pointer mapped to device buffer cmDevData     void dmidata  clEnqueueMapBuffercqCommandQueue, cmDevData, CLTRUE, CLMAPWRITE, 0, memSize, 0, NULL, NULL, ampciErrNum      memcpydmidata, hdata, memSize      unmap device buffer.     ciErrNum  clEnqueueUnmapMemObjectcqCommandQueue, cmDevData, dmidata, 0, NULL, NULL      we can call kernel here safely  codepre  pBut, if we use this new profiling method, the reported bandwidth becomes very low 915.2MBsblocksize33.5MB. 881.9MBsblocksize1MB. The overhead of map and unmap operation seems not as so little as zerocopy declare.p  pThis mapunmap is even much slower than 2909.6MBsblocksize33.5MB, which is gotten by using normal way of clEnqueueWriteBufferp  precode    forunsigned int i  0 i lt MEMCOPYITERATIONS i              clEnqueueWriteBuffercqCommandQueue, cmDevData, CLTRUE, 0, memSize, hdata, 0, NULL, NULL         clFinishcqCommandQueue      codepre  pSo, my final question is that what is the correct and most efficient way to use mappedzerocopy mechanism in Nvidia OpenCL environmentp  pAccording to DarkZeros s suggestion, I did more tests on the mapunmap method.p  pMethod 1 is just as DarkZeros s methodp  precodecreate N buffers in device forint i0 iltMEMCOPYITERATIONS i     cmDevData[i]  clCreateBuffercxGPUContext, CLMEMREADWRITE, memSize, NULL, ampciErrNum   get pointers mapped to device buffers cmDevData void dmidata[MEMCOPYITERATIONS] forint i0 iltMEMCOPYITERATIONS i     dmidata[i]  clEnqueueMapBuffercqCommandQueue, cmDevData[i], CLTRUE, CLMAPWRITE, 0, memSize, 0, NULL, NULL, ampciErrNum  Measure the STARTIME forunsigned int i  0 i lt MEMCOPYITERATIONS i       copy data from host to device by memcpy     memcpydmidata[i], hdata, memSize      unmap device buffer.     ciErrNum  clEnqueueUnmapMemObjectcqCommandQueue, cmDevData[i], dmidata[i], 0, NULL, NULL  clFinishcqCommandQueue Measure the ENDTIME codepre  pThe above method got 1900MBs. It is still lower than normal writebuffer method significantly. And more important, this method actually is not close to real case between host and device, because the map operation is outside profiling interval. So we cant run the profiling interval for many times. If we want to run the profiling interval for many times, we have to put the map operation inside the profiling interval. Because if we want to use the profiling intervalblock as an subfunction which transfer data, we have to do map operation before each time we call this subfunction because there is unmap inside the subfunction. So the map operation should be counted in the profiling interval. So I did the second testp  precodecreate N buffers in device forint i0 iltMEMCOPYITERATIONS i     cmDevData[i]  clCreateBuffercxGPUContext, CLMEMREADWRITE, memSize, NULL, ampciErrNum  void dmidata[MEMCOPYITERATIONS]  Measure the STARTIME forunsigned int i  0 i lt MEMCOPYITERATIONS i       get pointers mapped to device buffers cmDevData     dmidata[i]  clEnqueueMapBuffercqCommandQueue, cmDevData[i], CLTRUE, CLMAPWRITE, 0, memSize, 0, NULL, NULL, ampciErrNum       copy data from host to device by memcpy     memcpydmidata[i], hdata, memSize      unmap device buffer.     ciErrNum  clEnqueueUnmapMemObjectcqCommandQueue, cmDevData[i], dmidata[i], 0, NULL, NULL  clFinishcqCommandQueue Measure the ENDTIME codepre  pAnd this generates 980MBs, just the same as before result. Seems that Nvidas OpenCL implementation hardly can achieve the same performance as CUDA from the perspective of data transfer.p

Negative 79466 pI have a project where I try to invoke some JavaScript from an ObjectiveC class. It works if everything is in one class I can call the script. p  pHowever, when I bring another class in the mix, I cant seem to invoke the JavaScript of the WebView of the first class. I thought I wasnt calling the class correctly, but I made my invokeJS method just bring up an ObjectiveC AlertView and it worked. So I know that it is calling the method, but the JavaScript does not seem to work if I call the method from the second class.p  precode   [t invokeJS] codepre  pAnd in my other classp  precode voidinvokeJS    [self.webView stringByEvaluatingJavaScriptFromStringdan]    codepre  pAm I not allowed to invoke an action on another classs viewsp  pI should note this is a phonegap app so this is the reason for the rather awkward setup.p  pI  have a modal controller in which when I dismiss the controller I want to invoke the JavaScript.p  pI tried to directly access the webview from my modalViewController class, but that does not seem to to work eitherp  precode    [t.webView stringByEvaluatingJavaScriptFromStringdan] codepre  pAny help is greatly appreciated, thank you.p  precode STARImageController modalView  [[STARImageController alloc] initWithNibNameSTARImageController bundlenil]   modalView.myImage  fileContents   [self.viewController presentModalViewControllermodalView animatedYES] codepre  pThe above code is from my toast class t that presents the modal view controller. It might be worthy of note that my Toast class is not a view, but rather a child class of CordovaPlugin yet I am not sure it should matter...p
Negative 79466 pI have a relatively rare issue with AVSpeechSynthesizer where itll finish speaking an utterance, but then wont speak the next one I give it. If I go to the Home screen then come back to the app, however, itll start speaking again on its own.p  pIt only happens maybe once every 50  100 runs of the app, so I cant really reproduce it to test it more thoroughly.p  pThe codedidFinishSpeechUtterancecode delegate does called, but the next codedidStartSpeechUtterancecode does not. p  pI tried allocating a new instance of AVSpeechSynthesizer to see if that would fix things, but it did not.p  pHas anyone else experienced this issue Any ideasp

Negative 79466 pI have encountered a following problem when trying to optimize my application with CAmp the data transfers. For me, there is no problem with copying data from CPU to GPU as I can do it in the initial state of the application. The worse thing is that I need a fast access to the results computed by CAmp kernels so the bottleneck between GPU and CPU is a pain. I read that there is a performance boost under Windows 8.1, however I am using Windows 7 and I am not planing to change it.

Negative 79466 pI have been working a program for a long time and am stuck.  The program has a file with infix values in the file.  It reads the file and converts the infix to postfix then a class takes the postfix value and evaluates it.  I have converted to postfix but cant send the string for evaluation in the other class.  I am using my own stack for this.  I must be doing something wrong.

In other words, I thought that maybe OSGi expects me to list these native libraries in the order of their dependency, i.e. the most independent ones first. After a few hours of that kind of sorting of a hundred of libraries according to their order, it again failed miserably, what proves that this is not the reason. I have one magical order which was found by chance, when it loads successfully, and it does not resemble any pattern, it is absolutely random order. If I start changing it, then the chance is high that it will fail again. For example, I want to sort them alphabetically, and this will not work.p  pCould anybody clarfiy whats going on.

My guess is that the second codeforeachcode loop terminates after just writing all the commands out to codestdincode without waiting for the conversion to finish, so that codequitcode is issued and the Inkscape process is terminated before the whole conversion is done. Or a command is written to codestdincode while Inkscape isnt finished processing the previous command so that the second and possibly even the third and fourth one gets lost.p  pExecuting codesysteminkscape  . commandcode works and gets all files converted just fine, so I dont think the problem has something to do with the files.

Negative 79466 pShort story  I need a container that can store an unlimited number of elements, but does no dynamic memory allocation for a small number of elements.p  pLong story I need to store a couple of integers, the number of which is not bounded, but rarely more than two or three.  I tried using a codevectorltintgtcode or codelistltintgtcode, but the performance as compared to a simple array is worse by a factor of at least 50 in release mode, and 500 in debug mode.  For example, I measured creating a codevectorcode, calling codepushbackcode three times, and destroying it again. This takes around 250ns.  Calling codereserve3code upfront helps a bit, the time goes down to 100ns.  Using an array instead takes like 3ns, but I cannot use a fixedsize array because the number of elements is unbounded.  I need to store a lot of those things, as part of larger objects.p  pSo I guess what Im asking for is a container that uses some sort of small vector optimization As long as the number of elements is small they are stored within the object itself, and only when it grows beyond a certain limit it allocates memory on the heap. Does such a thing existp  pAs a side node, codebasicstringcode is known to have this sort of optimization, so I tried codebasicstringltintgtcode.  Indeed, for a size of 3 its four times faster than codevectorltintgtcode, but somehow using a string class for storing integers doesnt feel right.  So again, my question  Is there some container that performs well for small size, but if needed can grow unlimited  p  pstrongEDITstrong People asked for the actual code.  Well, there is nothing special about it, its straighforward.  I cannot post it because its part of a large benchmarking environment, with special purpose classes for timing, and some classes for obfuscating the code to prevent the compiler from replacing it with codecode.  You know, it does that when it notices the result isnt used.  The core of it comes down to thisp  precodevectorltintgt v v.pushback17 v.pushback19 v.pushback23 codepre  pandp  precodeint x[3] int k  0 x[k]  17 x[k]  19 x[k]  23 codepre  peach of which is run in a tight timing loop.  p  pstrongEDIT2strong The use case for this is a tree with a variable number of branches at each node.  So I actually need to store pointers and no integers, but this is on 32bit so both are the same size.  Performance of this is important, because the tree is constantly modified.p  pstrongEdit3strong People keep doubting my numbers.  Why do you think they are unreasonable  A codevectorcode does dynamic memory allocation, the array doesnt, and this seems to be a good explanation for the difference, or isnt itp

For HTTPS to work on that endpoint,  then you need an X.509 Certificate bound to the specified port as well. p  pwhy you said this  When enabling Transport security the endpoint address must include the HTTPS protocolp  phttps come to play when we host our wcf service in IIS. suppose when we host wcf service in self host  and tcp used as binding then why we need to include https in endpoint because you said enabling Transport  security and endpoint address must include the HTTPS protocol....is it correct  may be i could not understand  what you are trying to say. can you please explain in detail what you are trying to say for the point 1p  pstrong6strong when we use certificate at service end then client end which consume amp call the service they always  need to install certificate. if not then when client need to install certificate amp when not required.  one guy told me that client need to install certificate only when mutual authentication is required  but i do not know about what mutual authentication p  phere i just trying to know that when wcf service will hosted and attached with certificate then is it mandatory that client who consume the service heshe need to use certificate at client end p  pi guess it is not mandatory. only two end use certificate when mutual authentication would be consider. am i right p  pin case of mutual authentication server amp client end need to install or use same certificate or client can use different certificate purchase from abc.com and server end purchase certificate from xyz.com.p  pplease clearly discuss my above two points in details. thanks for your time amp answer.p
Negative 79466 pI wonder if hadoop support file level lock or notp  pFacing issue in production batch job setupp  pScenario is mentioned belowp  pI have to refer enterprized data in my batch job which gets refreshed by some other external application on which I do not have control.

After this I have another hadoop job which again refer the same enterprized data from same location which was referred by first set of jobs. This scripts runs for more than 4 hrs and because of total 10 hrs time window there is a possibility that refresh job again run which first delete the file and create it again.

Negative 79466 pI have an application written in C for Linux which has to listen for a list of 32 TCP sockets on specific ports. These sockets can be masked by the user so that events will no longer be reported for them until they are unmasked.p  pI am using the non blocking variety of poll timeout of 0 as my application is not threaded for backward compatibility reasons unfortunately. My question regards the performance implications of having file descriptors in a poll array which have no events to listen for events  0 versus lengthening and shrinking the array dynamically which will presumably be time consuming.p  pIs poll smart enough to skip over descriptors which do not have any events enabled or will I see a large performance hit from their existencep  pEither way, given the sockets will be polled frequently probably at 100Hz and changed relatively infrequently once every second which of these two methods is likely to see the best performance Will the overhead of polling descriptors with no events overwhelm the overhead of having to remake the array every time I make a changep

Negative 79466 pIn my app I have a sort of dashboard with buttons, images, labels, etc. This dashboard is common, apart from small variations, to several view controllers. I thought that a neat solution would be to implement the dashboard as a separate view controller that is included by means of embed segues and view containers in all the view controllers that need it. This works perfectly. However, I have many view controllers in my storyboard, and most of them are connected to the dashboard view controller, which makes the storyboard completely unreadable or, at least, the connections in it. Is it possible then to create all these connections programmatically so that the connections go away from the SB It seems to be possible to create segues programmatically, but what about embed segues If this is not a viable solution, what are the alternativesp

Negative 79466 papologies in advance if the question has been answered elsewhere, but I have searched and found no equivalent solution.  Feel free to link me if one has been made.p  pI have built an entire storyboard app with around 5060 view controller layouts in a xib file for the 4inch iPhone 55c5s, and I am looking for a way to scale down the screen.p  pBy scale down I mean automatically take each screen I laid out in storyboard and scaling it by aspect when the program is run on a smaller iPhone, like an iPhone 4S, 4, 3G, or any smaller model compatible with iOS 7.1.p  pI do not have the time to individually alter the configuration of every single layout item over the storyboard, as that amounts to 1000s of objects, so please restrict any answers or suggestions you have to something on a more massive scale.  Surely, some method of library must exist that allows us to just move everything into a smaller window on a smaller iPhone without clipping or cropping.  Even if the shrinkingscrunching causes blur or font to be less visible, that is much preferable to entire portions of the screen becoming offscreen.  p  pA global setting allowing for a simple aspect scale, multiplying every dimension of every object in the storyboard by destinationPhoneWidthiPhone5Width for horizontal dimension and destinationPhoneHeightiPhone5Height would be a satisfactory solution.  I am not aware of one that exists...p

In my view, I am doing the following to render the threads messagesp  precodethisgtpartialLoopgtsetObjectKeymessage echo thisgtpartialLooppartialthreadmessage.phtml, threadgtgetMessages codepre  pThe problem is that this fetches the entire collection of messages from the database. If I call codeslicecode as in my service, the same SQL query with codeLIMIT 10code is issued to the database, which is not desirable.p  pHow can I process a limited collection of messages in my service layer without issuing another SQL query in my view That is, to have doctrine create a single SQL query, not two. I could simply decrypt my messages in my view, but that kind of defeats the purpose of having a service layer in this case. I could surely fetch the messages manually and add them to the thread object, but if I could do it automatically through the association, then that would be much preferred.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 79466 pactually i am developing a universal app for Windows and Windows Phone. Within that app i am using dependency properties to assign data to properties of custom user controls in XAML.

So i think the problem is related to universal app projects. p  pAll other questions i have found could not solve my problem.  I would be appreciated if someone could give me a hint. p  pgreets p  pstrongEditstrongp  pWell i actually have solved the problem. But i think it is very curious. Beside the codeRulerButtoncode i have many other controls where i added the same dependency properties. On some of them i did not add the normal property codeBackendcode yet. Cause i first wanted to make the codeRulerButtoncode work. After completing these controls so that each of them has a codeBackendPropertycode and codeBackendcode attribute, all errors were gone. p  panyway thanks for your help guysp

Negative 79466 h2The problemh2  pI made a receiver application that is just showing a video in loop on the Chromecast.

Negative 79466 pi have a specific problem to solve. I dont know how to do it but want to do it without macro or worse without VB script.p  pI will explain what i have and then what i want to do. I have plan to have many sheets in worksheet. first sheet is some intro sheet, where i have also one column containing name of sheets in every cell. i am using formula MIDCELLfilename,A1,FIND],CELLfilename,A11,256 so i can change name of sheet and it will change also name of sheet in intro sheet cell.p  pso for imagination i have column N and there i have sheet1, under that sheet2 and so on... Each of sheets have the same construction and same formulas on the same place, so i have each sheet for every goods.p  pAnd now what i would like to have. I want to add a formula into intro sheet where i would summarize SUM add or something like that. It would take every value form each sheet on the same place on each sheet. so the formula would look something like this sheet1C4  sheet2C4  sheet3C4  ....  any sheetC4 but i dont know how many sheets i will have and the number will sometimes change and i dont want to edit formula because i plan to have more this kind of dynamic formulas.p  pi will just add another sheet into column N and every formula using this excel type for cycle would take and recount formula using this dynamic array. i hope you understand what i want. my problem is much more complicated but when i describe it more into detials you would loose the point of my interest.p  pthanks for any suggestionsp  pedit but if there is only a solution using VBA script, i will have to use it. i dont want to change formula everytime i add another sheet into worksheetp
Negative 79466 pIm wrapping a C function in python where the function allows a callback into python. I have the wrapper working, but with a reference counting problem that Id like help to understand and fix. [There are few working examples of language callbacks using SWIG that I could find so I could easily have got something quite wrong.]p  pA simple C function, func, that requires a callback is defined in cbtest.i. The func creates a C array and passes that array as a param to the callback. The func is wrapped to allow both the function to be called from python, and also for the callback to be defined in python. A simple client executing this is in test.py. The program works like this [Ive cut the example down to a minimum but its still not short]p  ul lifunc is called from python, with a python callback, mycb.li lia pythoncode wrapper for func creates an arrayclass array, pyvals[], which is used later to optimise data marshalling between the C and python callbacks.li lithe SWIG wrapper has a typemap for the callbackfunc typedef which maps it onto cbfunc, which is defined in cbtest.i. The python callback is stored in the pycbfunc global, and invoked by cbfunc.li lithe C func is a simple function which seeds a local array with square values, allows the callback to modify them, and prints the new values.li licbfunc is mainly a trampoline which executes mycb in python. The array param has to be copied from C to python data, and again in reverse after the callback has executed. We use pyvals[] for this purpose since it is only allocated once.li limycb is executed in python.li ul  pMy main problem is an apparent reference count problem in the pythoncode wrapper. I have found it necessary to point a temp variable at pyvals[] to avoid python crashing somewhere in wrapfunc. If the cbtest.usetmphack variable is set to False, python will crash. Can anyone point out why python crashes, and how the code can be changed properly. Since the problem is with a python variable that doesnt appear to go out of scope, I am a bit confused.p  pMy second question is, is there a better way of marshalling the array between the C and python callbacks I would prefer to just copy pointers to data between them rather than copying the array. But, the C func creates and owns the C array and that cannot be changed.p  pMany thanksp  ptest.pyp  precodeTest for SWIG callback reference count problem   import cbtest   If False, python crashes from a reference count problem cbtest.usetmphack  True   Callback for func.

Negative 79466 pI have defined a config file in my puppet manifest and I need to use an .erb template so I can load in dynamic parameters.p  pThe problem is however that the application insists on changing a couple of lines in that file prior to puppet running. Such lines cannot be easily discovered and put into the template for example, a build number that increments. If I tell puppet to refresh the service when the config file changes, then every puppet run I have my service being restarted, which isnt good.p  pIs there any way that I could use an .erb template with Puppet but tell it not to care if specific lines in it change Im not sure if this is possible or even if its going to work, but it would be good to know.p  pCheersp

Negative 79466 pWe have a fairly complicated framework made up of multiple plugins that weve developed for all of our future GroovyGrails applications.  One aspect of this framework is the ability to retrieve user information from the various systems that we store this data in.  Currently we have three classes that represent a user one for LDAP non AD, one for AD, and one for database.  The reason for three separate classes is because they access totally disparate systems and are based on different base classes to provide various functionality need to access these systems.  Theres also dependencies, etc. that require this three class approach.  One of these classes the one for AD is also used by Spring Security to represent a user.  It is also possible to create any user object type from another user object type.p  pWhat Im trying to create is a way for us to cache these objects.  For example, during login, one class is always loaded by Spring Security.  However, throughout the process of using the application, another class for database info for example might get loaded temporarily.  Ideally Id like to cache these objects that all represent the same user so that we dont have to reload information.p  pIn the end what Im hoping to accomplish, is the ability to pass one user object say AD to another user class say database factory method, and have the database user class check if it has ever existed before for this user and if so, instead of recreating itself, just grab the cached copy.  Id rather not use a central cache to do all of this caching, but instead store the cached information in the actual objects just seems cleaner that way.p  pWhat I cant figure out though is how to accomplish this from a design perspective.  So Im looking for recommendation on which design patterns might help me to figure out an approach to creating this functionality. p  pP.S. Just in case it matters, all user classes extend different base classes, however, they all implement a shared interface.p

Negative 79466 pI build graphics in which I use regular and bold font for titles andor labels. They contain symbols, text and numbers which I combine using codeplotmathcode.p  pI noticed that using codeboldcode within the expression changes only character strings to bold face, but not numbers which are part of the expression. See this minimal examplep  precodex lt y lt 110 plotx, y, xlabbquoteboldfoo[bar]2.meanx codepre  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comAWCtm.png altenter image description herep  pIn this example, there is a numeric superscript on the LHS, and an evaluated expression on the RHS of the equality sign. Both of which are not printed in bold face as suggested by using codeboldcode. When I change these to character strings, the plot shows them in bold.p  precodeplotx, y, xlabbquoteboldfoo[bar]2.as.charactermeanx codepre  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comV6Lqt.png altenter image description herep  pNow, for me it is not always desirable to work with character input in these expressions. I would like to find a way of setting the numeric values in bold without converting them to character strings. Im also not sure what to expect of the equality sign.p  pAdditionally, I use codeCairocode to select specific fonts for my graphics. In my actual graphics, where I also plot greek letters, I use it to set the symbol fonts to bold. By setting the regular font to bold, I could do the same for numbers, but that would affect all remaining text as well.p  pTherefore, I would appreciate if there is a solution that doesnt require to change the default font in the codeCairocode device.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pAs mentioned in the comments, codeplotmathcode does not apply codeboldcode to numeric constants as in the example above. I would still like to see if there is a solution that allows to set numbers in lablestitles to bold without changing the rest of the plot as for example codeCairocode would.p  pThanksp

Ive simplified my api service to a hrefhttpwww.asp.netwebapioverviewhostingaspnetwebapiuseowintoselfhostwebapi relnofollowthisa example, so there is no unnecessary complexity involved. My api is running on port 9000 for this example.p  pstrongThe problemstrong is that I get a 404 error when calling the method in the api. Using Fiddler I can tell that its not finding the clientaccesspolicy.xml.

Negative 79466 pHi I was trying to make my android app capable of opening certain types of links posted on twitter Twitter cards. The problem I am facing is if the link posted on twitter is a hrefhttpexample.com relnofollowhttpexample.coma and when the parameter pathprefix is not specified in android manifest, then the button on the card displays the open in app text and when you click on the link it opens a dialog which has my app as one of the chooser, when the parameter pathprefix is not specified in manifest, but if the link is a hrefhttpexample.compqr relnofollowhttpexample.compqra and pathprefix is pqr, then the open in app text is not displayed but rather open in browser text is displayed on the button and when I try to open the link in browser then the chooser dialog is displayed which contains my app. So, my app is capable of opening the link in app when it is opened from browser but not from the twitter card directly.

Negative 79466 pI am making turn based strategy based on a tiled map.

For now this tile is only 2px border of 32x32 transparent tile. To make highlighting disappear, I use similar for loop, where I set the tile to null. Selectingdeselecting tiles works great, but it is probably not the most efficient way to do this. I would like to exchange the blue border boxes into colored transparent boxes, something like in Advance wars during the movement, or as it can be seen below p  pa hrefhttprpgmaker.netmediacontentusers3355lockerTutorialTBSMove13.PNG relnofollowDesired look picap  pI tried to make a semi transparent tile on the second layer in tiled, but without luck. It could be nice if there is some possibility to apply only semitransparent color on the specific tiles, without using the second layer tile.

So I am posting here by pure demotivation there are similar posts already, yes, but none of them actually helped me out.p  pHere is how it goesp  pA few months ago, I decided to start learning modern OpenGL by pure curiosity, and finally decided to switch to DirectX after reading the downsides of OpenGL I was also only targeting Windows platform. I think it was one of the worst move I ever made I heard that OpenGL was lacking of documentation and everything was a mess with third party libraries, but I realized that DirectX was strongway worststrong than what it seemed to be compared to OpenGL. In fact, trying to code in modern DirectX 11 using Windows 7 and VS2013 is just a pain especially shaders and the time it takes to figure it all out is just a time waster. After reading a lot of porting articles on MSDN about alternative libraries, like DirectXTK, DirectXTex, DirectXMesh, Effects11 and DXUT, I still dont know what to do and how to setup a fully working modern project in Windows 7. Specifically, the 5 50 shader model deprecated combined with the new Effects11 library not deprecated is the thing that confuse me the most.p  pBy the way, I am currently reading the latest Frank Luna book about the subject Introduction to 3D Game Programming with Direct3D 11 and I still cant get his samples working at all even with DirectX SDK. Also, I dont know if what I am learning is relevant or not since he wrote it before the Windows SDK switch. For your information, the latest error I am trying to solve with his samples for those who know the book is a ENOINTERFACE from D3DX11CreateEffectFromMemory function at runtimep  pimg srchttpi1214.photobucket.comalbumscc494Golitan11enointerfacezps82133cd6.png altENOINTERFACEp  precodeHRD3DX11CreateEffectFromMemorycompiledShadergtGetBufferPointer, compiledShader   gtGetBufferSize,      0, md3dDevice, ampmFX   Done with compiled shader.

Negative 79466 pI am trying to read in and manipulate data that I have stored in large data sets. Each file is about 5GB. I mostly need to be able to grab chunks of specific data out of these data sets. I also have a similar 38 MB file that I use for testing. I initially used read.table to read in chunks of the file using nrows and skip. However,  this process take s a huge amount of time because the act of skipping an increasing amount of rows is time consuming. Here is the code I hadp  precodenumskip  0 how many lines in the file to skip curlist  read.tablefile.txt, header  TRUE, sep  ,,nrows  200000, skip  numskip, col.names  col col is a vector of column names codepre  pI set this up in a while loop and increasing numskip to grab the next chunk of data, but as numskip increasing, the process slowed significantly.p  pI briefly tried using read.lines to read in data line by line, but a few threads pointed me towards the sqdl package. I wrote the following bit of codep  precodelibrarysqldf f  filebigfile.txt dataset  sqldfselect  from f where CusomterID  7127382 example of what I would like to be able to grab codepre  pFrom what I understand, sqldf will allow me to use SQL queries to return sets of the data from the database without R doing anything, provided that the subset isnt then too big for R to handle.p  pThe problem is that my 4GB machine runs out of memory when I run the large files though not the smaller test file. I found this odd because I know that SQLite can handle much larger files than 5GB, and R shouldnt be doing any of the processing. Would using PostGreSQL help do I just need a better machine with more RAM Should I give up on sqldf and find a different way to do thisp  pTo wrap this up, heres an example of the data I am working withp  precodeProject CustomerID Stamp UsagePoint UsagePointType Energy   21           110981       YY         40            Red          0.17 21           110431       YY         40            Blue         0.19 22           120392       YY         40            Blue         0.20 22           210325       YY         40            Red          0.12 codepre  pThanksp

Negative 79466 pI have a c program with openmp parallel for.The machine has 24 cores. Each parallel task accesses distinct location in a mmapd file and does some computation. I am not setting any specific number of threads. I let openmp decide. I see a huge inconsistency in the number of threads run at a time when I look at htop.

I created an Arraylist of months in my controller class which is given to the hselectOneMenu. The starting element of the dropdown is Any whose value is a blank string.

The problem is however that the relation name which is set in the relation table, Table B is displayed in Table A as a string value D0001001  so not as a literal name. p  pTo get the literal relation name there is a link with Table B that has an ID column 1001  1000 and a relation literal name column. So for example in table B ID 1001 matches company name MC DONALDS and in table A the RelationID is D0001001 MC DONALDS.  p  pDont ask me why the RelationID in table A is with the weird D000 in front of it,  I dont know either but it had some functionality. p  pSo back to the problem.

The tree of the subfunction codefx3xcode would therefore look likep  precode                     NULL,,     ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       3,NULL,NULL,NULL    x,NULL,NULL,NULL codepre  pI imagined a recursive algorithm for creating the tree to work as follows, with codecode denoted the index of the array we are on as we iterate through it, and still using the function code5x23x1code. p  precode5x23x1                        NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL    5x23x1                        NULL,,  , NULL                                                                                                                                       5,NULL,NULL,NULL  5x23x1                        NULL,,      ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  5,NULL,NULL,NULL      x23x,NULL,NULL,NULL   5x23x1                        NULL,,    ,NULL                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    NULL,,      ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 5,NULL,NULL,NULL      x23x,NULL,NULL,NULL    5x23x1                        NULL,,    ,NULL                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    NULL,,      ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 5,NULL,NULL,NULL           x23x,NULL,NULL,NULL        5x23x1                        NULL,,    ,                                                                                                                                                                     1,NULL,NULL,NULL                                                                                  NULL,,      ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 5,NULL,NULL,NULL           x23x,NULL,NULL,NULL codepre  pexcept the node codex23x,NULL,NULL,NULLcode would actually built into a tree by recursion ... I dont feel like writing it out above because it would take even more space.p  pHeres the problem, though. I just realized that my algorithm relies on the fact that the operator precedence is going a certain way. When the algorithm gets top  precode 5x23x1              codepre  pit knows that since the codecode sign has lower precedence than the  sign that separated the previous two terms code5code and codex23xcode, it should make a new root for the tree and add the subtree for the terms code5code and codex23xcode onto the lefthand side of the tree. If, on the other hand, the function was code5x23x1code then when the algorithm gets top  precode5x23x1              codepre  pit has to redo the tree Im going to  start writing the tree in a more compact way nowp  precode                 5      x23x codepre  pand change it to p  precode                 5                                                             x23x      1 codepre  pwhich is a more complicated process than simply taking the tree and make it lefthandside of a new root. In fact, I cant think of an algorithm for redoing the tree. Is there one What does it look like Any general hints for how I can get past this road block or how to take an entirely different approach to the problemp

These states are useful to know, and you can go check the objects to see their states in plain HTML, but it is costly, in terms of time and ingame resources.p  pMany players cooperate, each checking various objects and reporting their findings, but there is a lot of overhead typing involved, and it is generally difficult to organize.p  pI want to write code that will eliminate the overhead AND organize the data.

Negative 79466 pUsually I prefer using Linux CentOS  Ubuntu for production server. However currently I got a customer who dont want to pay extra for hosting. In return he provides a server running windows server 2003. To save setting time, I would like to see if it is safe to use XAMPP as production server.p  pAfter some Google searches, many people says that it is not recommended, but usually with no reason given. The only exception is the a hrefhttpswww.apachefriends.orgfaqwindows.html relnofollowofficial QampA sectiona, stating that there are the following security issuep  blockquote   ol   liThe MySQL administrator root has no password.li   liThe MySQL daemon is accessible via network.li   liProFTPD uses the password lampp for user daemon.li   liPhpMyAdmin is accessible via network.li   liThe XAMPP demopage is accessible via network.li   liThe default users of Mercury and FileZilla are known.li   ol blockquote  pSo, if I am not installing ProFTPD and Mercury during XAMPP installation, setting a password for MySQL root account and set up a firewall that only allow public access on port 80, it seems that all 6 problems are solvedp  pIf so, except the security issue listed above, are there any other security  performance issue that I should not be using XAMPP for productionp

Negative 79466 pIm working on a big code base which has many solutions and many more projects.p  pWhen I write unit tests they often depend on a number of dlls being present which are built by other solutions into different output folders to my current solution.p  pI usually add build steps to copy required dlls to the current solutions output folder so that they can be found when I run unit tests. This can end up in a lot of wasted space and confusion with duplicate dlls and which is the master copy of each dll which is the one that should go into the installer.p  pIs there a better way of adding additional search directoriesp  pI was considering having a TESTMODULEINITIALIZE that will AddDllDirectory and then marking the dlls as delay loaded so that when they do load the added dll directory will be searched. But, I dont think that works as you have to mark the dlls as delay loaded in the exe. But, the exe is the testrunner which is out of my control.p

Negative 79466 pI want to implement a web listener to grab the posted array data from the webhook url. I have came across two ways to do this. 1. using IHttpHandler to handle the http request. 2. using wcf rest webservice to grab the request.p  pI also found that this can be done using a HttpListener but was unable to find a proper sample implementation.p  pCan anyone suggest the best way to do the above task and provide some references where I use to start the implementation. p  pThank you.p
Negative 79466 pGood day Ive got a problem with my code. We all know that we can only get the value of a codeltselectgtcode or dropdown through POST and GET method in submit button and codedocument.getElementByIdcode in codeltbuttongtcode and pass it through ajax to use it on PHP, my problem is I want to use codeltagtcode tag because Im going to generate or download an excel file using PHPExcel from the codehrefcode attribute of the codeltagtcode, the data that will be processed and download by the link will be filtered based on the value of the codeltselectgtcode, so is there any possible way to get the value of codeltselectgtcode, process it on the page wherein codeltagtcode will be redirected Thank youp
Negative 79466 pI am coding a program in MATLAB, in which I have to call a C library. To do so, I created a C file that calls the library and then a MEXfile that help me to call the desired function in MATLAB. The function I want to access in the library returns me a value, but I have to give it parameters. I am currently able to retrieve a value, because I write my parameteres directly in the C code as you can see here my files name is Test704p  precode Test704.cpp  Defines the entry point for the console application. define AFXDLL define  tprintf mexPrintf include StdAfx.h include 704IO.h include Test704.h include mex.h ifdef DEBUG   define new DEBUGNEW endif   CWinApp theApp   The one and only application object    using namespace std   int tmainint argc, TCHAR argv[], TCHAR envp[] int tmaindouble port[], double rack[], double offset[]  HMODULE hModuleGetModuleHandleNULL double  valueRead short port short rack short offset    if hModule  NULL         Initialize MFC and print and error on failure     if AfxWinInithModule, NULL, GetCommandLine, 0            tprintfTFatal Error MFC initialization failedn          else            whiletrue                valueRead  PortRead1, 780, 1         valueRead  PortReadport[0], rack[0], offset[0]         mexPrintfValue Read  in,valueRead         Sleep1   Sleep for 1s so we can see the value on the screen                  else        tprintfTFatal Error GetModuleHandle failedn      return valueRead    void mexFunctionint nlhs, mxArray plhs[], int nrhs, const mxArray prhs[]      double port, rack, offset      Creates a 1by1 real integer.      plhs[0]  mxCreateNumericMatrix1, 1, mxINT32CLASS, mxREAL     plhs[0]  mxCreateNumericMatrix1, 1, mxINT32CLASS, mxREAL      int data  int mxGetDataplhs[0]      port  mxGetPrprhs[0]     rack  mxGetPrprhs[0]     offset  mxGetPrprhs[0]     valueRead  mxGetPrplhs[0]      data[0]tmain0,0,0      return      data[0]  tmainport,rack,offset  codepre  pYou will notice that I have commented parts of the code in order to make researches.

Negative 79466 pI am creating a form that posts back to itself for validating using PHP, repopulating fields if the validation criteria fails. p  pOne component of this form is a table that allows the user to addremove additional rows by calling Javascript functions. Both of these functions work without issue when the page is loaded the first time, with the remove function looping through each row in the array looking for a checkbox as a flag to delete that row. p  pAfter posting the data back to the form, the remove function no longer works. I added in some alert lines to output variables at different stages so I could check it was looking at the table and counting the row numbers correctly. The problem seems to be when looking to see if the checkbox is satisfying the checked criteria. Although checked, it does not appear to be read as a True state so is not deleting the row. p  pHTML and PHPp  precodeltphp  apref  empt if SERVER[REQUESTMETHOD]  POST     apref  Posted      if issetPOST[chk]         chk  POST[chk]         else          chk  F     name  POST[name]     date  POST[datefrom]      gt  ltheadgt ltscript typetextjavascript srcjsscript.jsgtltscriptgt ltheadgt  ltbodygt ltform idform methodpost actionltphp echo htmlspecialcharsSERVER[PHPSELF]gt enctypemultipartformdatagt  ltfieldsetgt lttable iddataTable classformgt     lttbodygt     ltphp if apref  empt     foreachname as a gt b gt     lttrgt         lttdgtltinput typecheckbox namechk[]gtlttdgt         lttdgtltinput typetext namename[]         ltphp if isset POST[name]           print  value . name[a] . gtgtlttdgt         lttdgtltinput typetext namedatefrom[]         ltphp if isset POST[datefrom]           print  value . date[a] . gtgtlttdgt     lttrgt         ltphp  else gt     lttrgt         lttdgtltinput typecheckbox namechk[]gtlttdgt         lttdgtltinput typetext namename[]gtlttdgt         lttdgtltinput typetext namedatefrom[]gtlttdgt     lttrgt     ltphp  gt lttbodygt lttablegt ltinput typebutton valueAdd onClickaddRowdataTable gt  ltinput typebutton valueRemove onClickdeleteRowdataTable gt ltfieldsetgt  ltinput typesubmit valueSubmitgt ltformgt  ltbodygt codepre  pJavaScriptp  precodefunction addRowtableID      var table  document.getElementByIdtableID     var rowCount  table.rows.length     ifrowCount lt 5         var row  table.insertRowrowCount         var colCount  table.rows[0].cells.length         forvar i0 iltcolCount i              var newcell  row.insertCelli             newcell.innerHTML  table.rows[0].cells[i].innerHTML              else          alertMaximum has been reached.         function deleteRowtableID      var table  document.getElementByIdtableID     var rowCount  table.rows.length        forvar i0 iltrowCount i          var row  table.rows[i]         var chkbox  row.cells[0].childNodes[0]         ifnull  chkbox ampamp true  chkbox.checked                    ifrowCount lt 1                   alertCannot Remove all rows.                 break                          table.deleteRowi             rowCount             i                codepre
