Positive 65832 pI am testing an app that has some CarPlay functionalities. I activated the CarPlay window in the simulator by changing the default options usingp  precodedefaults write com.apple.iphonesimulator CarPlay bool YES codepre  pwhich works perfectly when it comes to starting up the CarPlay windows, either when the simulator starts automatically after the application is compiled in debug or if I manually open up the CarPlay window through codeHardware gt External Displays gt CarPlaycode when the app is already running in the simulator. The problem is that, in both cases, the main simulator window goes dark after showing the CarPlay splashscreen simmilar to the one seen on the phone in a hrefhttpi.ytimg.comviDTgcYd7UEsc0.jpg relnofollowthis imagea.p  pNow, I dont exactly know what the real life behavior is supposed to be, but I cant manage to simply execute a shutdown behavior on the CarPlay window and switch back to the main simulator window so that it displays the app or anything else for that matter. Currently, if I got back to the simulator menu and select codeHardware gt External Displays gt Nonecode, the CarPlay window simply dissapears, but the main simulator window stay blacked out.p  pSo, my question is, how can one simulate a CarPlay shutdown behavior when using the simulator, and how can I get back the OS in the main simulator window  On a more development focused side, I would also like to know exactly if and how I can detect that the Media Player becomes turned off when CarPlay shuts down, or, more specifically, if there is a way that one can programatically observe the event where the CarPlays a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosdocumentationMediaPlayerReferenceMPPlayableContentManagerRefindex.htmlapplerefoccclMPPlayableContentManager relnofollowmedia control capabilitiesa become unavailable.p

Positive 65832 pEver since i updated to the GM version of encode 7 Ive been unable to use the simulator.

Negative 65832 pIm whiling to add a support of Server Side events to a hrefhttpcppcms.sourceforge.net relnofollowCppCMSa. I understand the technical part of what to do on the level of communication Client sends long polling XmlHTTPRequest, and waits for respond, server accepts the connection and does not respond until server side event occurs and sends the response to the client. The client repeats the procedure.p  pHowever, this is too low level for most of web developers. There are many questions how do I manage events, how do I manage connections and so on.p  pI thought about two possible modelsp  ol lipThere are some named events defined and the server side, for example New Message in Chat Room no 134 when the request accepted the server side application checks the messages in the room  for example in DB and if there is no new messages for the client it subscribes to event and waits on it.p  pWhen some other client posts data to the server, it notifies all applications on the New Message in Chat Room no 134 event and they wake up and send these messages to clients, and so on.p  pThis model is still looks like quite low level model, but it hides all notification methods.pli lipAnother option is to define some named queues, so each client creates such queue upon connection to server and waits for new messages. When some client posts a new message to Chat Room no 134, on the server side it is broadcasted to all queues connected to this Chat Room no 134, and the message is delivered to client.p  pHowever there are many questions that are risenp  ul liHow do I manage queues and the session level, at the level of single pageli liHow do I delete queues and create timeouts on themli liWhat happens if more then one window subscribes to same queueli ulli lipCreate a persistent object on server side that glues between server side events and user side events.

Negative 65832 pLets say, I have 2 classes in the model User mapped to USERS table and PrivilegedUser inherits User, additional info is stored in PRIVILEGEDUSERS table.p  pNow, I have a row in USERS and instance of User and need to convert that user to PrivilegedUser i.e. to create a record in PRIVILEGEDUSERS with the same Id. Is there a way to do this without DeleteInsertp  pThe problem is you dont have PRIVILEGEDUSERS representation in the model, so you cannot create only that part of PrivilegedUser.p  hr  pIt was just an example. PrivilegedUser may have some discount or personal manager or whatever strongin additionstrong to ordinary User properties. In the same time, there are other tables which need to reference users regardless of concrete User type. Ive implemented it using TableperType inheritance mode. In the database level its very simple to convert users from one type to another you just need to insert or delete record from extension table. But in EF you have only UserSet which stores both User and PrivilegedUser objects. Thats why I ask is it possible to replace strongexistingstrong User object with PrivilegedUser keeping existing Id and without deleting record from USERS table.p

Negative 65832 pfirst of all, sorry for the non descriptive title, Im just too rushed so I couldnt come up with a better one. br  Second br  I have a portion of my database the looks like the following diagram br   img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comwaPjv.png altalt text I have contributors on the system, each write to many sources, and a source can have many working contributors. Users can subscribe to as many contributors as they like and as many sources as they like. Now, what I want to do is simply retrieve all the articles for certain user. These articles are either coming through a contributor or a source the user subscribes to. To make it easy, when a user subscribes to a source I simply copy all the sources contributors to the userscontributors table.

Negative 65832 pIm running a py2execompiled python program from one server machine on a number of client machines mapped to a network drive on every machine, say W. p  pFor Windows XP and later machines, have so far had zero problems with Python picking up Wpython23.dll yes, Im using Python 2.3.5 for W98 compatibility and all that. It will then use Wzlib.pyd to decompress Wlibrary.zip containing all the .pyc files like os and such, which are then imported and the program runs no problems.p  pThe issue Im getting is on some Windows 98 SE machines note SOME Windows 98 SE machines, others seem to work with no apparent issues. What happens is, the program runs from W, the Wpython23.dll is, I assume, found since Im getting Python ImportErrors, wed need to be able to execute a Python import statement, but a couple of things dont workp  p1 If Wlibrary.zip contains the only copy of the .pyc files, I get codeZipImportError cant decompress data zlib not availablecode nonsense, considering Wzlib.pyd IS available and works fine with the XP and higher machines on the same network.p  p2 If the .pyc files are actually bundled INSIDE the python exe by py2exe, OR put in the same directory as the .exe, OR put into a named subdirectory which is then set as part of the PYTHONPATH variable e.g Wpylib, I get codeImportError no module named oscode os is the first module imported, before sys and anything else.p  pCome to think of it, sys.path wouldnt be available to search if os was imported before it maybe Ill try switching the order of those imports but my question still stands Why is this a sporadic issue, working on some networks but not on others And how would I force Python to find the files that are bundled inside the very executable I run I have immediate access to the working Windows 98 SE machine, but I only get access to the nonworking one a customer of mine every morning before their store opens.p  pThanks in advancep  hr  pEDIT Okay, big step forward. After debugging with PY2EXEVERBOSE, the problem occurring on the specific W98SE machine is that its not using the right path syntax when looking for imports. Firstly, it doesnt seem to read the PYTHONPATH environment variable there may be a py2exespecific one Im not aware of, like PY2EXEVERBOSE.p  pSecondly, it only looks in one place before giving up if the files are bundled inside the EXE, it looks there. If not, it looks in library.zip.p  pstrongEDIT 2strong In fact, according to a hrefhttpwww.py2exe.orgindex.cgiPy2exeEnvironment relnofollowthisa, there is a difference between the sys.path in the Python interpreter and that of Py2exe executables. Specifically, codesys.path contains only a single entry the full pathname of the shared code archive.code Blah. No fallbacks Not even the current working directory Id try adding codeWcode to PATH, but py2exe doesnt conform to any sort of standards for locating system libraries, so it wont work.p  pNow for the interesting bit. The path it tries to load atexit, os, etc. from is p  blockquote   pcodeWlibrary.zipltmodulegt.ltextgtcodep blockquote  pNote the single slash after library.zip, but the double slash after the drive letter someone correct me if this is intended and should work. It looks like if this is a string literal, then since the slash isnt doubled, its read as an invalid escape sequence and the raw character is printed giving codeWlibrary.zipos.pyd, Wlibrary.zipos.dll, ...code instead of with a slash if it is NOT a string literal, the double slash might not be normpathd automatically as it should be and so the double slash confuses the module loader. Like I said, I cant just codeset PYTHONPATHWlibrary.zipcode because it ignores that variable.p  pIt may be worth using sys.path.append at the start of my program but hardcoding module paths is an absolute LAST resort, especially since the problem occurs in ONE configuration of an outdated OS.p  pAny ideas I have one, which is to normpath the codesys.pathcode.. pity I need codeoscode for that. Another is to just append codeos.getenvPATHcode or codeos.getenvPYTHONPATHcode to sys.path... again, needing the codeoscode module. The codesitecode module also fails to initialise, so I cant use a .pth file.p  pemI also recently tried the following code at the start of the programemp  precodefor pth in sys.path     fErr.writepth     fErr.write to      pth.replace,  Fix Windows 98 pathing issues     fErr.writepth     fErr.writen codepre  pBut it cant load linecache.pyc, or anything else for that matter it cant actually execute those commands from the looks of things. Is there any way to use builtin functionality which doesnt need linecache to modify the sys.path dynamically Or am I reduced to hardcoding the correct sys.pathp

Negative 65832 pI am making a Mac application, and I want my menu bar to look right.p  pAny Mac user knows the menu bar should be in the top screen menu.  Setting codeapple.laf.useScreenMenuBarcode to codetruecode in the property list file gets rid of the inframe menu bars and moves the menu bar of the current focused window to the screen menu.p  pHowever, when all windows are hidden or when there are no windows, there are no menu bars to move to the top, and you just get a blank menu.  I heard a solution to this was to create an offscreen window that is focused when no others are.  The only purpose of it would be its menu, so that it could fill in when the others are gone.p  pHowever, Ive been getting loads of problems.  I cant seem to move the window off the screen because Macs wont let you set the coordinates to something past the size of the screen it just cuts it off and positions it at the edge instead.  Is there something else I have to do to make an offscreen windowp

Negative 65832 pTo begin with, let me say that I understand how and why the problem Im describing can happen. I was a Computer Science major, and I understand overflowunderflow and signedunsigned arithmetic. For those unfamiliar with the topic, Apples Secure Coding Guide a hrefhttpdeveloper.apple.commaclibrarydocumentationSecurityConceptualSecureCodingGuideArticlesBufferOverflows.htmlapplerefdocuidTP40002577SW7 relnofollowdiscusses integer overflowa briefly.p  pMy question is about reporting and recovering from such an error once it has been detected, and more specifically in the case of an ObjectiveC framework. I write and maintain a hrefhttpcocoaheads.byu.educodeCHDataStructures relnofollowCHDataStructuresa. I have a few collections classes that allocate memory for storing objects and dynamically expand as necessary. I havent yet seen any overflowrelated crashes, probably because my test cases mostly use sane data. However, given unvalidated values, things could explode rather quickly, and I want to prevent that.p  pI have identified emat leastem two common cases where this can occurp  ol liThe caller passes a very large unsigned value or negative signed value to codeinitWithCapacitycode.li liEnough objects have been added to cause the capacity to dynamically expand, and the capacity has grown large enough to cause overflow.li ol  pThe easy part is detecting whether overflow will occur. For example, before attempting to allocate codelength  sizeofvoidcode bytes, I can check whether codelength lt UINTMAX  sizeofvoidcode, since failing this test will mean that the product will overflow and potentially allocate a much smaller region of memory than desired. On platforms that support it, the a hrefhttpwww.opensource.apple.comsourceremovefileremovefile17checkint.h relnofollowcheckint.h APIa is another alternative. The harder part is determining how to deal with it gracefully. In the first scenario, the caller is perhaps better equipped or at least in the mindset to deal with a failure. The second scenario can happen anywhere in the code that an object is added to the collection, which may be quite nondeterministic.p  pMy question, then, is this strongHow is good citizen ObjectiveC code expected to act when integer overflow occurs in this type of situationstrong Ideally, since my project is a framework in the same spirit as Foundation in Cocoa, Id like to model off of the way it behaves for maximum impedance matching. The Apple documentation Ive found doesnt mention much at all about this. I figure that in any case, reporting the error is a given. Since the APIs to add an object which could cause scenario 2 dont accept an error parameter, what can I really do to help resolve the problem, if anything What is really considered okay in such situations Im loath to knowingly write crashprone code if I can do better...p

Negative 65832 pId like to know the best way to approach testing strongruby mixin modulesstrong, in this case for use with ActiveRecord models, but really this is a general quesiton that applies to any class that you are extending with a mixin.p  pIs it better to strongattempt to stub all of the necessary functionalitystrong of the Class that your mixin is extending, strongor just test the real classstrong as present and extended in your appp  pStubbing would remove external dependencies for the tests, but it fails to test the mixin emunder real circumstancesem.  If the test fail, it could be either your implementation or the class you are extending that changed or broke.  If testing with a stubbed class your tests may pass but the emfunctionality could be brokenem if the class you are extending changes.p  pOpinionsp

Negative 65832 pIm searching a space of vectors of length 12, with entries 0, 1, 2.  For example, one such vector isbr 001122001122.  I have about a thousand good vectors, and about a thousand bad vectors.  For each bad vector I need to locate the closest good vector.  Distance between two vectors is just the number of coordinates which dont match.  The good vectors arent particularly nicely arranged, and the reason theyre good doesnt seem to be helpful here.  My main priority is that the algorithm be fast.p  pIf I do a simple exhaustive search, I have to calculate about 10001000 distances.  That seems pretty thickheaded. p  pIf I apply Dijkstras algorithm first using the good vectors, I can calculate the closest vector and minimal distance for every vector in the space, so that each bad vector requires a simple lookup.  But the space has 312  531,441 vectors in it, so the precomputation is half a million distance computations.  Not much savings.p  pCan you help me think of a better wayp  pEdit  Since people asked earnestly what makes them good  Each vector represents a description of a hexagonal picture of six equilateral triangles, which is the 2D image of a 3D arrangement of cubes think generalized Qbert.  The equilateral triangles are halves of faces of cubes 454590, tilted into perspective.  Six of the coordinates describe the nature of the triangle perceived floor, left wall, right wall, and six coordinates describe the nature of the edges perceived continuity, two kinds of perceived discontinuity.  The 1000 good vectors are those that represent hexagons that can be witnessed when seeing cubesinperspective.  The reason for the search is to apply local corrections to a hex map full of triangles...p
Negative 65832 pI have an Eclipse project which is built using Maven, and Im using the m2eclipse plugin inside Eclipse for its Maven support.p  pHowever this project also contains a codebuild.xmlcode which is not used for actually building the project, but just for scripting capabilities as a utility for developers on the project  it is not used in building or packaging the product just helping to automate some side tasks the developers often have to invoke on the side.p  pWhenever this file is opened in an editor in Eclipse, Eclipse notices what it thinks is a problem with some missing declarations in the build.xml and begins to display errors for the project in the Problems view along with a red codeXcode iconmarker for the project to show that there are build errors. These arent even true problems with the codebuild.xmlcode, just some problems that Eclipse thinks are present because it is not able to import all of the other dependent files this codebuild.xmlcode is using. There are no build errors with the project, just errors in what Eclipse in its infinite wisdom is able to parse about a codebuild.xmlcode used for auxiliary purposes.p  pIs there any way to tell Eclipse to ignore a build.xml or ignore Ant warnings in a particular project Do I need to remove the codeJava Buildercode from the codeBuilderscode tab of the project propertiesp

Negative 65832 pSimply put, I am trying to create a custom logger for visitors to a php site with mysql. In doing so, I found that I was inserting two entries for every single page load. p  pstrongI have already ruled out the code running twice by accident.strongp  pnbspnbspnbspI put the query on every page, assuming it would work flawlessly. After realizing it was causing two entries to occur, I was confused and removed the query from the other pages, leaving it only on the index page.p  pnbspnbspnbspUtilizing PHPs SERVER[HTTPREFERER] and SERVER[PHPSELF], I inserted the values into the log. To see where I was beforehand and where I was at currently. p  pnbspnbspnbspemSo lets say I was on the create page, and I clicked a link to the home page named index.php. The entries in the database would say referer was create.php and the current page was index.php. However, a second entry would be inserted that said referer was index.php and the current page was index.phpemp  pnbspnbspnbspI checked what would happen when I clicked a link to a page without the logger, so I clicked to go to the create page. I checked the database and there was another entry, strongbut ironically only one entry was inserted this timestrong. This was weird because the create page has no code to log a visitor and it was only inserting one entry. However, it was saying that the referer was create.php and current page was index.php. Which is backwards from what it should be. p  pnbspnbspnbsp Doing more research, I decided to look into watching the headers live. So I checked using firefox and IE, where I realized that the headers get the page Im requesting and also always gets the root page as well. For example, a request to create.php returns..   p  pGET create.php HTTP1.1 br GET style HTTP1.1  br GET  HTTP1.1 brp  pnbspnbspnbsp I understand the first GET, for the page I request, I understand the second GET for the external stylesheet. The last one is what confuses me, although it seems to corroborate why Im getting the duplicate entry. p  pnbspnbspnbsp Since, there is no visitor log on the create.php page there is no first entry to the log, but once it loads the root page, the entry is created for the create.php being referer and the current page is the index.php page because it is loading the root page. p  pnbspnbspnbsp Since, there is a visitor log on the index.php page, when I go from create.php to index.php, the first GET creates an entry of create.php being the referer and current page being index.php, but a second entry says that index.php is the referer and the current page. p  pSo I am pretty certain it is this reasoning for which I get a second entry. p  pstrongCan anyone tell me why it is loading the root page on every requeststrongp  pIm using xampp for mac os x locally, and I understand it might be the default favicon. However, I just removed the icon and it still occurs, even though the favicon doesnt display. p  pI can supply code samples and other things, it just seems irrelevant at this point because the insert query works, it just occurs twice when I clearly only execute it once.p
Negative 65832 pJust an idea I had but I cannot get it to work. Simply setting the property this.length  len throws an error because there is no setter. Setting the length property descriptor configurable true causes the prototype property to change along with the instance. In this case x and y are undefined in the prototype so length becomes NaN instead of staying a getter like I want. If configurable is false thenp  pChromium Length is set on the derived object. the getter still works on the prototype but it appears as an error value.p  pFF4 Changes to the getter are silently rejected and length is not set on the derived object.p  pHeres what I have so far.p  precodefunction Vec2x, y    this.x  x   this.y  y  Vec2.prototype  Object.create   Object.prototype,        length        get function length vec           var len  Math.sqrtthis.x  this.x  this.y  this.y          Object.definePropertythis, length, value len          return len       ,       configurable true          codepre

Negative 65832 pHow do you implement the ViewModelLocator pattern when youre using IOC child containers  A typical locator implementation is something likep  precodepublic IViewModel ViewModel     get  return Services.ServiceLocator.GetInstanceltIViewModelgt   codepre  pwhere Services.ServiceLocator is a read only static property.  But this breaks down if youre using child containers.  Heres my definition for Services.ServiceLocator using child containersp  precodepublic static IServiceLocator ServiceLocator      get  return RootContext.ServiceLocator   codepre  pClearly this is not correct my injected dependencies will come from the root container instead of the child container.  The child container is created and boot strapped by something other than my current view.  Thus my current view can auto wire from the child container.p  pSo how do you get the right container in a multiple container scenario  The standard answer is to constructor inject it, but that doesnt seem possible with the ViewModelLocator it requires a default constructor so it can be constructed from XAML.  p  pIm also after a solution that works in both Silverlight 4 and WPF 4.0 since Im working on a PRISM composite application thus no markup extensions.  I happen to be using Unity as the IOC container.  Oh and the solution should work in Blend that is, it should not prevent the creation of a new design time view model that bypasses the IoC container.p

That does not make sense tho cause that means that each time interval is about 80 seconds. It would make more sense if they were in nanoseconds which would mean the time interval is about .08 seconds or 12 data was captured in every second. But then it would contradict the documentation.

Negative 65832 pI have a list of parameters and I have the method name. I want to invoke the method using reflection.   When I checked the java doc for Method.invoke its like Method.invokeobject o, Object args... .  I know what to pass for the first paramter i.e instance on which method to be invoked if its instance method and args is the parameters for the method. p  pBut now I have have the list which contains values which are to be passed to the method. p  pSay for example I want to invoke method ClassName.methodNameString , int, int and I have a List which contains val1, 3, 4. p  pUsing reflection it may  be like Method.invoke classNameInstance, . But I am not sure how to convert a list of arguments to varargs and pass. p  pOne way may be If i know that list size is 3 then I may write Method.invoke classNameInstance, list.get0, list.get1, list.get2. p  pBut some of the methods which I want to dynamically invoke take 0 to 12 arguments. So it doesnt look good to create switch case and write 12 cases. Each will check with number of parameters and build the separate call with parameters.p  pAny way to go about this except from using switch casep  pAny help will be greatly appreciated.p

My work flow is like thisp  ol listart my codeRegisterServicecode, where I call coderegisterReceivercode method to register a codeBroadcastReceivercode, which can receive codeACTIONSCREENOFFcode.li ol  p2.In the codeonReceivecode method of this codeBroadcastReceivercode, I start an activity as the screensaver.p  p3.In the activity, I write codeLog.icode statement to track its running.p  pMy question is p  pWhen the screen times out, or when I press the POWER key, the screen turns off, and the system will send ACTIONSCREENOFF message. As I expect, my receiver starts the screen saver activity. However, I find this Activity calls codeonCreatecode, codeonResumecode, codeonPausecode, codeonResumecode sequentially according to the output in logcat.p  pstrongIt seems as if some a activity comes at front of my screensaver and finishes immediately, so my screensaver calls codeonPausecode and then codeonResumecodestrong. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.com3Aut9.png altenter image description herep  pAny idea This problem handicaps me in programming, please help.

Negative 65832 pIm trying to bind a listarraylisthashmapetc of custom objects to my form in JSP using Spring. Right now, the controller creates a Map of the two lists Boolean list and custom object list in codereferenceDatacode, and provides it to the form which uses those values to populate the fields. The values are initialized from a MySQL database using Hibernate, and all that works fine. The list is a known length before the form is initialized, so that part is easier. Now what Id like to do is correctly bind those objects in the form, so that when there are changes made, I can detect that in codeonSubmitcode or wherever is appropriate, and update the database accordingly. I cant seem to bind them correctly in the form so that I can see changes made. I tried just using a list of the form fields as the model, but even that wasnt working correctly. Do I just need to inject the list in a particular way Any ideas or examples here Any help would be greatly appreciated.p  pUPDATE At Ralphs request here is the solution I used In my data object class, I lazy loaded a map using codeMapUtils.lazyMapcode, with a String key and other custom object value. The other custom object is just a class that contains codeListltStringgtcode and getterssetters. In the corresponding .jsp file, I just nest several loops to loop through the keys first using codeloop.current.keycode and then codeloop2.current.value.paramsListcode to loop through the values for that key. This was not really what I asked for in my original post, as I was looking for a more general solution, and the lazy loading pointed me in the right direction.p

Negative 65832 pAs a bit of background we are a small Access software house with 10  years of working with over 150 Customer sites.  We have 5 different apps.   Our main product has over 30,000 lines of vba and about 400 forms and reports.  I am telling you this background as we think we know our vba and access. We normally work in Access 2003, but compile and distribute in Access 2k, Occasionally we will work in Access 2002 , 2007 and 2010.p  pWe have run into a problem where in the last week or so some not all of our applications will not allow us to compile on some machines.  Last week we had a problem with one windows7 box where Access 2003 was regularly crashing that seemed to rectify itself on a compile on an XP machine and amove to worko solely in Access 2k, this week a second win 7 box is having problems with a specific app will not compile  error on opening an ADO recordset.  This seems to have started after an install of Access 2010. This seems now to have spread to other machines.  p  pWe think its most likely an ADO reference issue but it is weird as other apps as other apps with the same references on the same PC and the same lines of code complile OK. p  pWhat we have tried so far, all machines are up to date with latest MS patches. We have uninstalled and reinstalled the various versions of access.  It seems to be worse and starts on Win 7 but we now have a version that will not complile on XP Pro or Vista.  Some of these machines we have been using for 4 or 5 years and have had no such issues.  Thanks in anticipation of your feedback.   p

Negative 65832 pI currently have an annoying bug with the Editor in Visual Studio 2010 Express. Whenever I add a CustomControl in the Editor, any changes I make after that to the form, isnt saved in the .cs File, which basically means that when I add f.e. a MenueStrip to the Form, the code wont be generated and will not be added to the .cs file, but it will be displayed in the Editor correctly. Any idea how I can fix thisp  pThe Custom Control is a XNAControl and it works properly. p  pEDIT Someone suggested restarting VS. It did work but I do have another Bug now. I can now apply changes to the Form and add  delete Stuff, but when ever I run the app the CustomControl will be deleted from the .cs after I stopped debugging, which means that I need to readd the CustomControl after every run.p  pstrongEDIT2 I found a workaround. After running the app, the EditorWindow can be bugged, so no changes you make are applied to the .cs file, a simple closing and reoppening of the Editor of the Form will fix the Problem.strongp
Negative 65832 pIm not sure if I am approaching this the right way looking for some input from the community.p  pIm using the following plugginsp  ul lisfDoctrineGuardPluggin for user managementli lisfForkedDoctrineGuardApplyPluggin for registration of new usersli ul  pWhat Im trying to achievep  pId like to allow my registered users to register childusers.  To do this, the childusers that they create must inherit a couple of the parents attributes their corporateid, employertype, etc... in childusers profile at bind time.  Setting these attributes has been challenging, as from what I can surmise from my reasearch, the sfApplyApply form does not have setters that can be overridden.  p  pAs an alternative, I attempted to create a whole new user module which uses the sfguarduser table schema.  This worked somewhat, but it lost the features found in the registration pluggin email confirmation and it was not salting the password or something because I was never able to login a user created this way  which always produced an error saying the username or password were incorrect.p  pSo the question is, whats the best approach to achieve my desired result  p

Negative 65832 pI am having some trouble understanding this brute force approach. I am using Perl to extract questions and their choices. All of the questions right now are being stored inside of an array. I am not sure what to do with the answers.p  pHow should I store the answers and organize my code so it does something similar to this...p  ol lipSelect the first option for the question. So pass one, all the questions should have option A selected.pli lipSubmit to check for correct answers.pli lipParse answers, if the given answer was correct mark that as correct answer and forget trying to select any other choice for that question.p  pOtherwise, continue through the list of answers for that question on the next pass.pli ol  pSo the next pass would pick the second answer for the that question, until after multiple submits it finds all of the correct answers via brute force.p  pI am having trouble how to store the answers and associate them with the question, cross them off as they are wrong or tag it found.p  pI was thinking about using a hash.

The user clicks Begin Practice which generates 4 random questions from the pool of 10. Thus, at this current state I have four questions with their answers. I go through and add these questions and their answers to a data structure one from below... or using files to store them. Next I being to pick an answer. Then the user must submit these questions for review. Once the submit button is hit, the prompt says if question x is correct or incorrect. Based on this, the data structure must update which is the correct answer for that question.p  pNow to rinse and repeat. This time another four set of random questions is generated from that same pool. This time, two new questions are found so these must be added to the data structure. Similar logic should be used to find the answers. Also, each answer option selection always has an unique numeric value attached to it so my server can check the answer ID with the value. On my server side each question just has an ID and its associated right answer.

Negative 65832 pSuppose I develop a social networking site and I decide that I want the core of the application to be completely RESTed. A user logs in with a password.

Negative 65832 pIm using the Netty library version 4 from GitHub.

When I try to implement it in the above way, the compiler complains that my codeoperationCompletecode implementation actually returns codeUnit scala.util.continuations.cpsParam[Unit,Unit gt Unit]code instead of codeUnitcode.  I get that there is sort of a gotcha in scalas CPS in that you must annotate a codeshiftcode methods return type with codesuspendablecode, which gets passed up the call stack until the coderesetcode, but there doesnt seem to be any way to reconcile that with a preexisting Java library that has no concept of delimited continuations.p  pI feel like there really must be a way around this  if Swarm can serialize continuations and jam them over the network to be computed elsewhere, then it must be possible to simply call a continuation from a preexisting Java class.  But I cant figure out how it can be done.  Would I have to rewrite entire parts of netty in Scala in order to make this happenp

Ive read a lot of stuff before writing here, really, even something about marshalling option and other strange stuff, but i dont understand it, and i think its not needed.

Negative 65832 pWe have a SQL Server 2008 database that has stored procedures to handle readswritesetc.  These procedures are used by a variety of applications internally.p  pThe need has come up for a single person to make updates directly to a one of the tables in the database called Employee.  The update is dirt simple update VARCHAR and INT foreign key fields.  The problem is that SharePoint 2010 doesnt easily support this kind of update through BCS browsing and updating isnt the best user experience.p  pIts been suggested that this is easily solved with Excel and VBA.  On open, Excel connects to the SQL Server database and reads from the Employee read stored procedure.  It also executes the read sprocs for the tables the foreign keys reference.  The user makes an update to a field, which in turn calls the Employee update sproc.p  pThe advantages to this are that there is no website interface that needs to be builthostedetc the DBA is fine with this approach if Active Directory is used to authenticate.p  pThe problem is that I cant find a VBA programmer or any helpful resources or stepbystep walk throughs to write the VBA.p  pDoes anyone know of such an online resource andor have an alternate suggestion on how to quickly get an admin interface up and running for the single userp

Negative 65832 pIm using codeMono.WinFormscode to create external windows in Unity and it works great except that I get this error message each time I play the scene but never the first time when Unity is freshly started p  blockquote   pCould not register the window class, win32 error 0.p blockquote  pI figured that it was because that the form classes are not unregistered when I stop the scene. They do get unregistered when I restart Unity and I dont have the problem when I make a build, which makes sense.p  pI get this popup error twice and its caused byp  ol licodemyForm  new Form1codeli licodemyForm.Showcodeli ol  pI went through the code of the codeXplatUIWin32.cscode file and found the codeRegisterWindowClasscode method. When Mono registers a class it does thisp  precodeclassname  string          .FormatMono.WinForms.0.1,             System.Threading.Thread.GetDomainID .ToString , classStyle codepre  pSo I managed to get rid of the second error by doing thisp  precodeUnregisterClassMono.WinForms.1.0, IntPtr.Zero codepre  pSo my question is why does it only work for the 2nd popup error and how do I get rid of the 1st one I tried to force the garbage collection but it didnt help. I tried to find another registered class name but no luck here neither.p  pFor info I use the mono version of System.Windows.Forms.dll as a reference, compile my code in Visual Studio and import the produced DLL in Unity. It works great apart from those popup errors.p

The allocator then checks to see if the this pointer is in the range of the memory block for the heap and if it is then I can assume its not a root.p  pSo the issue comes when I want to trace from the roots through the child objects using the zero or more RelocObjects located inside each child object.  p  pI want to find the RelocObjects in a class ie a child object using a precise method.  I could use a reflection approach and make the user Register where in each class his or her RelocObjects are.  However this would be very error prone and so Id like to do this automatically.p  pSo instead Im looking to use Clang to find the offsets of the RelocObjects within the classes at compile time and then load this information at program start and use this in the mark phase of the garbage collector to trace through and mark the child objects.p  pSo my question is can Clang help Ive heard you can gather all kinds of type information during compilation using its compile time hooks.  If so what should I look for in Clang ie are there any examples of doing this kind of thingp  pJust to be explicit I want to use Clang to automatically find the offset of Foo which is a typedef of RelocObject in FooB without the user providing any hints ie they just writep  precodeclass FooB  public     int ma     Foo mptr  codepre  pThanks in advance for any help.p

About 100 extensions per category and the problem I am having right now is writing a crawler to at least grab the UIDs. The website appears to be updated by javascript. If I were to grab the html, Id get nothing because the site appears to load the rest of the page at a later stage. In other words, the core content I need i.e. the DOM with all the extension elements seems to load after I grab the HTML using python. Any ideasp

Negative 65832 pMy team handles several Java projects using Eclipse, and shares the code using a code repository.p  pWhen a developer adds, removes or updates a codejarcode file, the build is broken for everybody else, until they update their build path in Eclipse. This process involves cumbersome email synchronization.p  pFor several reasons, we have decided not to commit the code.classpathcode file to the repo. Instead, we came up with the following idea Each project will have a committed file, say codejars.listcode, which contains a list of codejarcode files and patterns. A script will convert this file into a local code.classpathcode for eclipse. Whenever a developer changes its jars, it is his or her responsibility to change codejars.listcode and commit it.p  pIs this a reasonable solution Are there any existing solutions for this problemp
Negative 65832 pIm currently programming an extension to a program, which only supports i386 and I am running amd64 Ubuntu 11.10. Whenever I compile my extension source I need to use the m32 flag to force 32 bit architecture otherwise the program will not be able to load my extension. Sooner or later it is inevitable to avoid boost thanks to its huge and stable library, which leads to my problem.p  pI want to use the boost filesystem, which uses OS specific function calls, which in turn leads to the requirement of a library file instead of only a header implementation. The problem is I cantdont know how to setup the boost filesystem i386 version on my amd64 machine. If I download a prebuilt .deb package for i386 and install it using forcearchitecture it still fails complaining about dependencies.p  pSo basically how do I setup boost with 32bit i386 architecture on my amd64 systemp

Negative 65832 pHello im having problem with segmentation of the following picture below. Its coloured character which needs to be recognized. Im using sharpening, wiener deblurring and wiener smoothing. After that im segmenting the picture with fuzzyc means clustering 3class. But in the case of letter E the best i get is without sharpenin,deblurring and smoothing, just with thresholded fcm segmentation. I should however get a better result than this, where i could combine those two parts as a whole not just upper white part with the other half black. p  pHow could i solve this problem to be more robust and to work with other images also, for example the 5 in the picture The outcome of 5 is with sharpening, debluring and smoothing, on top of fcm clustering.

Negative 65832 pIn order to build shaders for Windows Store apps and Windows Phone 8 Shader model 40level93 you need to use the vs40level93 and ps40level93 . While all this sounds fine using the HLSL syntax designed for DirectX 10 and up, Im unable to use the VPOS semantic from DirectX 9 or use SVPOSITION from DirectX 10 and up in a pixel shader, so what do I do besides making yet another semantic for outputting the vertex position in clip space p  pPS Some shaders on 40level93 spit out an internal error blob content mismatch between level9 and d3d10 shader which I have no idea what is about. Probably some inconsistency with the driver I suppose  I use an Nvidia GTX 560 TI that I see it goes away if you just compile your shaders with release flags like optimization level 3 and avoid flow control.p

The players parents it is a youth team have to pay fees to play.p  pI have one table with players details such as name, contact details, date joined, and another table with financial details  money they have paid in, money they are due to pay.  This financial table can look messy but the reports I have created tidy it up, it is a simple incomeoutgoing table.p  pThe users have to, on the 1st of each month, use the incomeoutgoing form once for every player and state that the players monthly fee of 20 is due, considering the club has about 100 players this is time consuming.p  pI would like a form that is based on a query of all players or I can adjust the query to filter it to certain groups to suit and duplicate for more forms, that the user can input a date and amount, and this appends a different record for every player in to the financial table.p  pI do not know how to create VBA, but I can copypaste code if required.p  pThanks for your helpp  pMark.p

Negative 65832 pI am learning perl and understand that it is a common and accepted practice to unpack subroutine arguments using shift. I also understand that it is common and acceptable practice to omit function arguments to use the default codecode array.p  pConsidering these two things, if you call a subroutine without arguments, the codecode can and will, if using shift be changed. Does this mean that calling another subroutine with default arguments, or, in fact, using the codecode array after this, is considered bad practice Consider this examplep  precodesub total   calculate sum of all arguments     my runningsum      take arguments one by one and sum them together     while          runningsum  shift          runningsum   sub avg  calculate the mean of given arguments     if   0  return      my sum  amptotal  gets the correct answer, but changes      sum    causes division by zero, since  is now empty  codepre  pMy gut feeling tells me that using shift to unpack arguments would actually be bad practice, unless your subroutine is actually supposed to change the passed arguments, but I have read in multiple places, including Stack Overflow, that this is not a bad practice.p  pSo the question is if using shift is common practice, should I always assume the passed argument list could get changed, as a sideeffect of the subroutine like the codeamptotalcode subroutine in the quoted example Is there maybe a way to pass arguments by value, so I can be sure that the argument list does not get changed, so I could use it again like in the codeampavgcode subroutine in the quoted textp

Negative 65832 pI have to implement a Reversi game for Android. I have managed to implement all the game, is functional, but the problem is that I dont have an AI.

Negative 65832 pI am using Celery standalone not within Django.  I am planning to have one worker task type running on multiple physical machines.  The task does the followingp  ol liAccept an XML document.li liTransform it.li liMake strongmultiplestrong database reads and writes.li ol  pIm using PostgreSQL, but this would apply equally to other store types that use connections.  In the past, Ive used a database connection pool to avoid creating a new database connection on every request or avoid keeping the connection open too long.  However, since each Celery worker runs in a separate process, Im not sure how they would actually be able to share the pool.  Am I missing something  I know that Celery allows you to persist a result returned from a Celery worker, but that is not what Im trying to do here.  Each task can do several different updates or inserts depending on the data processed.p  pWhat is the right way to access a database from within a Celery workerp  pIs it possible to share a pool across multiple workerstasks or is there some other way to do thisp

Negative 65832 pBackgroundp  pI am looking for a way to calculate the score of a piece of audio based on listeners feedback.  Each time a user listens to the track, they must vote if they like it, a simple yes or no.

Each vote will have a different amount of decay, based on when the vote was originally cast.p  pCan anyone help or recommend some material to look atp  pThanksp

There is a third tab in between the Foo and Bar tabs call it Baz.

In one of the fragments I actually create IDs dynamically and dont want to assume there will be no collision. Also, that solution is weird to me  loader IDs should be local to each fragment otherwise, why can I have Loaders with the same IDs in different fragments under normal circumstancesp  pIt seems I can also eliminate the crash by calling codesetOffscreenPageLimit2code on my ViewPager, so that the Foo view is not discarded when we switch to the Bar view.

Negative 65832 pI have a large text file that I would like a split into an arbitrary number of smaller ones.

I am developing a game with this tool  www.scirra.com p  pIt is called construct 2 and it uses javascript. It has a plugin to use socket.io and websockets so either one would be great.p  pSo basicly I want to develop a delphi server that would receive messages from the one javascript client and broadcast it to the other javascript client. If the user wanted to host a game he would run the delphi application and then join the game and wait for other players to join.p  pTo sum up   A Is it possible to use websockets in delphi to communicate with javascript.   B if so would someone please make a simple demo.p  pThanks for your timep

Negative 65832 pIm supposed to use the VS unit testing framework to ensure all code is working correctly. However Im having A LOT of trouble getting tests that require command line arguments to work since command line inputs must be given at runtime...and with unit tests there is no real runtime. Is there a way to run my unit tests with command line argument inputs I realized this is not the ideal way to construct a program, but I unfortunately do not decide how the testing process works.p  pIve read that I can potentially write a batch file and include it in the MStesttestcontainer folder. There are some hurtles I have to clear in order to do it this way though. These hurtles includep  p1 I know nothing about batch filesp  p2 I dont know where the MStesttestcontainer folder is, how to access it, how it works, or even how to add files to it since it seems to be hidden or not easily accessible.p  p3 I dont know what I would do with the batch file even if it was written correctly and in the MStesttestcontainer folder. How are my tests even supposed to know its there, let alone take input from itp  pSo to summarize How does one make VS unit tests take in command line arguments If I DO have to use the batch file method, I would much appreciate it being explained to me like Im 5. I apologize if I appear a little helpless in this subject, but I cant find any clear or useful explanations on how any of these things work within this specific context.p  pThanks a ton.p

It uses getMoreResults. First iteration was successful and on second I got exception. It happened on my production system and I cannot reproduce it again. Stored procedure itself didnt throw lock timeout because code is wrapped in trycatch. Just to double check Ive removed trycatch blocked, simulated lock timeout and Ive received exception on call codeexecutecode  which makes sense. Its like lock timeout happened AFTER stored procedure execution and in the middle of printing results set I only have defined locktimeout inside trycatch block. I didnt set queryTimeout or anything like that in jdbc connection stringp  pAnother theory is that network bandwidth was full at that precise moment after successful calling of stored procedure and in the middle of printing result sets. The problem with that theory is that I dont have any other timeouts set. p

The facts 1 the server I am trying to deploy my solution on is running a thirdparty software sending email from a dedicated address I need to use the same email address. This functionality is active and working 2 I tried to connect to the SMPT server via telnet and I succeeded in sending an email to my private email address through SMPT protocol. This was expected, because the other software encounters no problem in doing the same job 3 I tested my solution, with trycatch block to get any error, but no email reaches the destination, even if my code terminates with no errors.p  pI tried a lot of different options for smtp and message and also with alternative destination addresses, but the result has always been the same no message is sent. The last chance I have is to look for any conflict with server configuration or antivirus software. But I cannot realize why a plain dialog with the server through SMPT protocol is successful and my very simple code is not.p  pLast note the mail server i mentioned should be a Microsoft Exchange Server.p  pWhere could be the problem Any help will be appreciated.p

Suppose there were 100 births and 50 of the babies were   named Michael in 1920 vs 1000 births with 55 of the babies named   Michael in 1950. In this case the popularity of Michael was actually   higher in 1920 than in 1950.p      pThe datasets were collected from 1917 to 2010. Your program will   determine the how many times a name occurs per hundred thousand births   in 5 year intervals starting from the year 1921 you can ignore data   before 1921. Thus, if the user entered Allison, you will determine   the popularity of Allison from 1921 to 1925, 19261930, 19311935,   ..., 19962010 there are a total of 18 five year periods between 1921   and 2010. You can assume that there are no more than 150,000 records   in total in the two files combined.p      pIn each case the total population is the sum of all births within the   year range for both males and females. The number with the name you   are interested in is the sum of all births with the given name in the   year range. Your program will present the data in as both a value   number of babies with the name per hundred thousand births and a   graph of that data.p blockquote

The AuthenticationManagerImpl considers them in order, finding a CredentialToPrincipalResolver which               supports the presented credentials.                           AuthenticationManagerImpl uses these resolvers for two purposes.  First, it uses them to identify the Principal              attempting to authenticate to CAS login .  In the default configuration, it is the DefaultCredentialsToPrincipalResolver              that fills this role.  If you are using some other kind of credentials than UsernamePasswordCredentials, you will need to replace              DefaultCredentialsToPrincipalResolver with a CredentialsToPrincipalResolver that supports the credentials you are              using.                           Second, AuthenticationManagerImpl uses these resolvers to identify a service requesting a proxy granting ticket.               In the default configuration, it is the HttpBasedServiceCredentialsToPrincipalResolver that serves this purpose.               You will need to change this list if you are identifying services by something more or other than their callback URL.             gt         ltproperty namecredentialsToPrincipalResolversgt             ltlistgt                 lt                      UsernamePasswordCredentialsToPrincipalResolver supports the UsernamePasswordCredentials that we use for login                       by default and produces SimplePrincipal instances conveying the username from the credentials.                                            If youve changed your LoginFormAction to use credentials other than UsernamePasswordCredentials then you will also                      need to change this bean declaration or add additional declarations to declare a CredentialsToPrincipalResolver that supports the                      Credentials you are using.                     gt                 ltltbean classorg.jasig.cas.authentication.principal.UsernamePasswordCredentialsToPrincipalResolver gt                     ltproperty nameattributeRepository refattributeRepository gt                 ltbeangtgt                 ltbean       classorg.jasig.cas.adaptors.ldap.BindLdapAuthenticationHandlergt       ltproperty namefilter valueuidu gt       ltproperty namesearchBase valueDCMINISTER,DCFR gt        ltproperty          namecontextSource          refcontextSource gt      ltbeangt                  lt                      HttpBasedServiceCredentialsToPrincipalResolver supports HttpBasedCredentials.

If you are representing services by something more or other than an HTTPS URL whereat they are able to                      receive a proxy callback, you will need to change this bean declaration or add additional declarations.                     gt                 ltbean                     classorg.jasig.cas.authentication.principal.HttpBasedServiceCredentialsToPrincipalResolver gt             ltlistgt         ltpropertygt    lt     Config CAS with LDAP     gt     ltbean idcontextSource classorg.jasig.cas.adaptors.ldap.util.AuthenticatedLdapContextSourcegt   ltproperty nameanonymousReadOnly valuefalse gt   ltproperty namepooled valuetruegt   ltproperty nameurlsgt      ltlistgt     ltvaluegtldap192.168.0.88389ltvaluegt       ltlistgt   ltpropertygt   ltproperty nameuserDn valueDCMINISTER,DCFRgt   ltproperty namegroupDn valueDCMINISTER,DCFRgt   ltproperty namepassword valueuserPasswordgt   ltproperty namebaseEnvironmentPropertiesgt      ltmapgt     ltentrygt              ltkeygtltvaluegtjava.naming.security.protocolltvaluegtltkeygt              ltvaluegtsslltvaluegt      ltentrygt     ltentrygt      ltkeygt       ltvaluegtjava.naming.security.authenticationltvaluegt      ltkeygt      ltvaluegtsimpleltvaluegt     ltentrygt      ltmapgt   ltpropertygt  ltbeangt  codepre  pand also  I make in strongpom.xmlstrong  p  precodeltdependencygt     ltgroupIdgtorg.jasig.casltgroupIdgt     ltartifactIdgtcasserversupportldapltartifactIdgt     ltversiongt3.5.2ltversiongt  ltdependencygt  codepre  pand I make in strongapachetomcat7.0.47webappscasserverwebapp3.5.2WEBINFlibstrongp  pcasserversupportldap3.5.2.jarp  pbut when I start cas server I have this error p  precode           ...

Historically, I have simply written data directly to a server, and only used some simple keyvalue storage with shared preferences for local storage.p  pI am considering this time, instead, using SQLite to save the information at first, and sync the data to the server in the background later.

Negative 65832 pWhile Ive seen many questions dealing with Cocoapods and static libraries, most of them seem to assume youll eventually have a single workspace with your static library and end target app.p  pIn my scenario, I am building a static library. More specifically, Im hacking a MyLib.framework for users to consume. Id strongreallystrong like to manage MyLib.frameworks dependencies with Cocoapods, but it creates many pain points when consumers of my library emalsoem use Cocoapods.p  pFor example, my library has an AFNetworking dependency which I manage with Cocoapods. When I build my library, it links in libPods.a which includes AFNetworking, as well as some dummy filesobjects. If users of my framework also use Cocoapods to build emtheirem app, theyll see something like thisp  precodeduplicate symbol OBJCMETACLASSPodsDummyPods in     UserserikkerberDropboxProjectsMillMainMyLib.frameworkBuddySDKPodsdummy.o     UserserikkerberLibraryDeveloperXcodeDerivedDataMillMainfngfqhlslygksgcfuciznkpqfrbrBuildProductsDebugiphonesimulatorlibPods.aPodsdummy.o duplicate symbol OBJCCLASSPodsDummyPods in     UserserikkerberDropboxProjectsMillMainMyLib.frameworkBuddySDKPodsdummy.o     UserserikkerberLibraryDeveloperXcodeDerivedDataMillMainfngfqhlslygksgcfuciznkpqfrbrBuildProductsDebugiphonesimulatorlibPods.aPodsdummy.o ld 2 duplicate symbols for architecture i386 codepre  pI imagine if they were to add an AFNetworking dependency, that they would also get duplicate symbols relating to AFNetworking.p  pI plan to eventually distribute MyLib with Cocoapods as well, but I also want to be able to distribute a MyLib.framework itself.p  pIs there any way to use Cocoapods with my library while making Cocoapods safe to any potential userp

Negative 65832 pIm working on a scrolling list of codeCheckbuttonscode using the technique from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5860675variablesizelistofcheckboxesinstandardtkinterpackagethis posta. p  pIve noticed that the created windows within the codeTextcode widget will sometimes spill over the top and bottom borders of the widget itselfp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comij4lg.jpg altenter image description herep  pObviously it doesnt stop the widget from doing its job, but it just looks sloppy, and I tend to be picky about such things. p  pTweaking the height of the widget can reduce the instances of it, but doesnt stop it from happening. The codepadycode setting doesnt help either, as it is only applied to the absolute top and bottom of the entire contents vs. the currentlyvisible portion.p  pI even tried switching to a codeCanvascode instead of a codeTextcode widget, but the same spillover occurs, even when I use codeyscrollincrementcode to gain full control over the scrolling behaviour.p  pIs this just a limitation of Tkinter, or is there some other setting or a clever approach that Im missingp  pIn case it matters, my environment is Python 2.7.6, on Windows 7.p

Negative 65832 pI keep on reading about RVO and passing arguments by reference vs value. I get the idea passing by reference is just syntactic sugar for passing a pointer, and passing by value calls the classs copy constructor to make a copy of the original object for the function to use. RVO avoids invoking a copy constructor for a functions return value.p  pWhat I am missing in my understanding is when exactly construction of arguments passed by value and objects returned by value occurs. What I assume is that objects passed by value are constructed on the stack just before the actual call and return value is copy constructed in the absence of RVO just before returning. Is this correctp
Negative 65832 pI have a table, and Id like to add a hideableshowable panel below each row for more controls and info than can reasonably fit in the table row.

It could keep pairs of rows together using a css class tablesorterchildRow. I also dont believe I can have multiple tbodies because they arent sorted along with rows  each tbodys rows are sorted.p  pI thought about using jquery afterwards to insert a tr after each original tr, but then d3 wont update the table properly when something changes since the data wont join properly, and the reason Im using d3 is because it makes building lots of dom elements easier for me at least.p  pSo, question time how else can I create this panel thatp  ol limoves with the original table rowsli lidoesnt affect sortingli lican be hidden or shownli ol

Negative 65832 pI recently wrote a small Java application with Eclipse and packaged the exported Runnable Jar using Apples Jar Bundler. Everything works great, except my plist keys for hiding the application icon in the dock. I have tried previous plist keys I have used before to hide my dock icon, but they are not working. I run my app, the icon shows up in the dock and sits there bouncing for a while, then it stops bouncing and just sits there. I dont want the Dock icon shown, and I dont want a system tray icon. I am just needing my app to run in the background. p  pKeys I have tried and had no luck.p  papple.awt.UIElement truep  pandp  pApplication is agent UIElement set to TrueYes in Plist Editorp  pUPDATE Here is my plist.

Negative 65832 pStarting from the Jan 1st 2014 the 2 week periods yield the following schedulep  ol liJan 14li liJan 28li liFeb 11li liFeb 25li liMar 11li liMar 25li liApr 8li liApr 22li liMay 6li liMay 20li ol  petc ...p  pThis is not an idle question. Some companies have exactly 2 week long pay periods, meaning they have 26 pay periods per year rather than 24 for a company that pays twice a month as opposed to every two weeks exactly. I want to know whether I can express the pay schedule of such a company using a CRON expression.p  pFinally, it is possible that no CRON expression can be used to express what I want, but the Quartz scheduler may have some tricky solution that can ultimately produce the needed schedule. Note, that I can always create a calendar scheduler with 26 explicit triggers  one per pay period. I am not talking about this kind of solution. p  pI am using the .NET port of the Quartz library.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pAn equally good schedule would be strongexactly every other Sundaystrong. Note, it is not equivalent to strongevery 2nd and 4th Sundaystrong. Indeed, if a month has 5 Sundays, then the first schedule may result in three instances for that particular month, if started from the first Sunday. Whereas the second schedule always yields exactly two instances per month.p  pI have a feeling such schedules cannot be expressed in CRON, because they carry over from month to month, whereas CRON resets its month trigger each time a new month starts.p  pstrongEDIT2strongp  pI guess what I am looking for could be expressed by an imaginary strongDayOfYearstrong CRON field. Helas, no such thing exists. But then again, I could be wrong.p

Negative 65832 pI found a weird thing that Occasionally the same UITextView displays differently on iPad3 and iPad mini2 just like photos below. It is OK on iPad3 but not OK on iPad mini2p  pstrongUpdate My iPad3 is IOS6 and iPad mini2 is IOS7. Now the problem is the same UITextView display differently by IOS version.strong Finally I solved it. The reason is the sentence is TheU00a0earthU00a0revolvesU00a0aroundU00a0theU00a0sun. not The earth revolves around the sun. I should use halfwidth white space not fullwidth white space.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.commQrpg.jpg altiPad3p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comqGv1v.jpg altiPad mini2p  pI do not know why because I think iPad3 and iPad mini2 has the same screen resolution. Does any body can help thanks.p

Negative 65832 pI am implementing a command tree for a parser to walk. To allow users of the library to add their own commands to a tree I have provided a handle that calls a handler coded by the user. p  pThe user uses this by creating the handler that calls a library function for each command to be registered, passing it some details on the command and a handle for the command handler itself.p  pWhen the parser then walks the tree it can find the handle for the command handler and call that function.p  pMy question then is, should the handlers be available globally i.e. extern declarations in a header file. As I have a handle to each one saved onto the tree, they dont, strictly speaking, emneedem to be global, but I thought that semantically, they are called from outside of the file they are defined in so maybe they should bep  pAn examplep  pThe library user may have the file codemyOwnTreeCommands.ccodep  precode This function has its handle passed to the library which is called by the library    when building the tree.    int16t registerUserCommands void       The user adds the following to register one user command, thus providing a handle        for the command, to the tree structure.            return registerChild ampcmdHandler    This function then provides the handler for the registered user command.  int16t cmdHandler void       ... Here the user can then add code to make the registered command       perform the action they require.        codepre  pShould then codecmdHandlercode be made global via codemyOwnTreeCommands.hcode or made static, even though it works without being global Is there a standard patternbest practice for this scenario Thanksp

Negative 65832 pI get the following error  LNK1123 failure during conversion to COFF file invalid or corrupt when i build my solution in QtCreator 5.0.2.How to solve this problemp
Negative 65832 pI recently began working with Selenium and to make life easier to start I was using node to run my scripts so that I could visually monitor the tests. My challenge now is to convert it so that it can be run as a headless test. Unfortunately, most of the resources that I have come across only address using phantomjs and ghostdriver with Java or Python. My boss wants me to run the test through phantomjs without Java or Python. Eventually these tests will be run remotely through a Linux VM on a server without a GUI. Currently I am testing using Mac OS X 10.8 and still have many bridges to cross in order to get to my goal.p  pMy most important question firstly, is it possible to run a script from phantomjs through a port without the use of Java or Python I have spent hours poring through as many resources as I could come across and Ive come up with no solution.p  pIf so, how can I properly initialize the test to run headless Here is how I scripted the start of my functioning test. I want to properly switch the capabilities from firefox to phantomjs and be able to run it headless using the appropriate port. The rest of the test navigates to a specific site, logs in through a widget, then does further navigation to the area which I will build further tests on which to manipulate after I get this working.p  precodevar webdriver  requireseleniumwebdriver, SeleniumServer  requireseleniumwebdriverremote.SeleniumServer  var server  new SeleniumServerPathseleniumserverstandalone2.39.0.jar,  port 8910   server.start  var driver  new webdriver.Builder. usingServerserver.address. withCapabilitieswebdriver.Capabilities.firefox. build codepre  pThe test works perfectly, but I am new to this so there might be something foolish that I am overlooking. Please let me know what adjustments to make so that it will run headless through phantom. When I attempt to use node to run the script after switching capabilities to phantomjs it produces p  precodeSeleniumnodemodulesseleniumwebdriverphantomjs.js22 LogLevel  webdriver.logging.LevelName,                              TypeError Cannot read property LevelName of undefined  at Object.ltanonymousgt Seleniumnodemodulesseleniumwebdriverphantomjs.js2233 codepre  pThats a read only file that I cant adjust, any attempts that I made to define LogLevel or LevelName to the appropriate corresponding value DEBUG, etc. were fruitless.p  pAnd if I run it through phantomjs itself I get p  precodeError Cannot find module path   phantomjsbootstrap.js289  phantomjsbootstrap.js254 in require  It also lists module http  and various undefined function errors codepre  pI feel that with that instance I didnt properly organize where the files for Selenium, phantomjs, and ghostdriver should go in order to play nice. I also removed the server setup portion and instead ran this first, then the script separately.p  precodephantomjs webdriver8910  codepre  pBut it yielded the same result. All of my research to fix these issues turned up instructions for Java and Python but not Javascript by itself. Rather than chase through many rabbit holes I figured it wise to consult better minds.p  pIf you know better than I do and that it is fruitless to attempt this without Java or Python, please let me know. If you know where the issue lies within my script and could propose a fix please let me know. I hope that I have properly described the nature of my issue and if you need more information I will do my best to provide it to you.p  pThis is my second week working with Javascript so if you believe I am making a noob error you very well may be correct. Please, keep in mind that the script works through node with selenium webdriver.p  pMany thanks for your time Isaacp

Negative 65832 pI am reading the a hrefhttpman7.orglinuxmanpagesman2mount.2.html relnofollowmounta amp a hrefhttpman7.orglinuxmanpagesman2clone.2.html relnofollowclonea man page.

Lets says 5 amp 6 are mount points in the parent process. I clarified mount points in another a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq22886714682869questiona.p  pSo my understanding is  5 amp 6 are mount points means that the mount command was used previously to mount file systems directory hierarchies at 5 amp 6 which means there must be directory trees under 5 amp 6 as well.p  pFrom mount man page p  precode A mount namespace is the set of filesystem mounts that are visible to a process.  codepre  pFrom clone man page p  precodeEvery process lives in a mount namespace.  The namespace of a process is the data  the set of mounts describing the file hierarchy as seen by that process.  After  a fork2 or clone where the CLONENEWNS flag is not set, the child lives in the  same mount namespace as the parent. codepre  pAlso p  precodeAfter a clone where the CLONENEWNS flag is set, the cloned child is started in a  new mount namespace, initialized with a copy of the namespace of the parent. codepre  pNow if I use clone with CLONENEWNS to create a child process, does this mean that child will get an exact copy of the mount points in the tree 5 amp 6 and still be able to access the rest of the original tree  Does it also mean that the child could mount 5 amp 6 at its will, without effecting whats mounted at 5 or 6 in its parent processs mount namespace.p  pIf yes, does it also mean that child could mount  unmount a different directory than 5 or 6 and effect whats visible to the parent process p  pThanks.p

Negative 65832 pI am developing a GWT based client server web application.p  pThe application installs a web site on the IIS. When clients first browse to the web site, they need to run a local installation, which installs a local process and a NPAPI plugin on the client computer.p  pThe client runs in browsers such as IE, Chrome and Firefox, and uses the NPAPI plugin to send messages to the local process. The local process is used for accessing the file system, registry, etc.p  pIn order to prevent other web sites from using the NPAPI plugin, When a user first login, the server sends him a hash of a string which contains the URL of the site  some other data. The NPAPI plugin has access to the current URL of the browser, and also creates the same hash and compares the two.p  pDue to Chrome upcoming end of support of NPAPI plugins, I am trying to replace the plugin with a Chrome extension, and a native messaging host. The extension cant be limited to a certain domain because it can be used from many domains. p  pI am trying to figure out a way to prevent other web sites from using the extension to send messages to the native host but cant find a way to do it. Does anyone have an idea how I can accomplish thatp  pAny advice would be greatly appreciated, thanks.p

Negative 65832 pHave a relatively simple question here. I need to run a function in the background in bash. Normally I would do it just like sop  precodeFUNCTION amp codepre  pbut things are a bit more complicated than that.

Main takes a minute to process for each record. This however does not work.p  precodecat databasesWAN  grep v   while read LINE do MAIN amp done codepre  pAny suggestionsp  pstrong UPDATE strongp  pThanks for all the responses. Let me see if I can answer some of those questions. p  pgniourfgniourf  Yes I know using cat like this is wrong. This was early on, and critical code, so I have not updated it yet. I now read into the while loop for most things I do. I will fix it eventually. You may be right about syntax. When I break it up like so, things seem to work nowp  precode  cat databasesWAN  grep v   while read LINE   do     MAIN amp gt devnull 2gtamp1   done codepre  pSo that fixes the background problem. I wonder what was messed up in my single line syntax. Thanksp  pchepner  I dont believe LINE is a variable. I could be wrong though. Some things about Bash still confuse me. Maybe it is and is a variable that the entire record from the database gets stored to prior to processing.p  pBruce K  Waiting is exactly what I was trying to avoid. If I let it run in the same terminal one at a time, it will slowly process each record in order. If I push each record to a seperate terminal for processing, all records will be processed simultaneously at least in our eyes. The additional overhead is intentional in order to speed up how quickly the loop through the database occurs.p  pRadix  Yes youre right. Ill read up on that. Thanks for the link.p

Negative 65832 pIn a Visual Basic program for school I have a combo box of drop down style simple. When a user enters text into the text field of the combo box and also a separate text box and presses the Add button, the program adds the text in the combo box text field to the items in the combo box and adds the value in the text box to a corresponding array. Thats all working peachy.p  pThe problem is that there has to be a change button.

Negative 65832 pI am currently working on a huffman text compression exercise, but ive encounter some issues with the coding of my header.I used my strongcharacterfrequency tablestrong to save the information I need as header for decompression of the file All converted into binary strings then save in byte arrays.p  pSo at first, I used 2 bytes for each character, 1 byte for character and 1 byte for its frequency. However I realized it will not work for a large text which the frequency of some characters could surpass 2551byte.p  pTherefore I made a modification, I adjust the reserved bytes for each character depending on its frequency. it look something like thisp  precodepublic String freStringint freq, String s     freq  freq  255     s  s  11111111      iffreqgt255         s  freStringfreq,s     else          String remainFreq  Integer.toBinaryStringfreq        patch the ommited zeros of last byte        remainFreq String.format8s, remainFreq        remainFreq  tempString.replace , 0        s  s  remainFreq           return s    codepre  pWith this, during decompression I will look at the next byte to see what is its value, if its 255, then keep adding the value of next byte... etc. p  pExample of my headerp  p[ 9 , strong141strong, 3, strong142strong, 255, 33, strong143strong, 255, 255, 2 ]p  p[length of my header  9 ,strongastrong  3, strongbstrong  288, strongcstrong  512]p  pIt works fine, but it greatly reduced my compression ratio as text gets larger and larger.  Ex if the a repeats 5000 times. I will en up using up to strong20 bytesstrong to store my string of frequency value instead of strong2 bytesstrong 00010011 10001000  5000p  pSo here is my question... is there a better strategy I can use to increase the reserved byte of a character dynamically and at the same time indicate the end of freq string  Ive though of reserving minimum of 3 bytes per character 1 for the char, 1 for its freq, and 1 to indicate end of freq string but this will affect the compression ratio of smaller text file.  Is this the trade off i must take or there exist a better way of doing itp

Negative 65832 pI am running a query in an Oracle SQL environment using Toad where I build a table by joining 16 different tables and I am running out of temp tablespace and was hoping I could get some advice on how to make my query more efficient.  I dont have a background in this so I am not sure if the best way is to use intermediary tables or change the order of my joins.p  pThere are two main tables, Header and Detail, the header has 26 million rows, the detail has 175 million rows.  I use an inner join with these tables which will result in 175 million rows.  The other 14 tables are smaller description tables that I join using left joins.  Three of those tables are 350k rows and less, the other 11 are under 1,000 rows.  My current pseudo code is as followsp  precode    create table ENDTABLE as     select      from Detail     inner join Header     left join descriptiontable1     left join descriptiontable2     left join descriptiontable3     left join descriptiontable4     left join descriptiontable5     left join descriptiontable6     left join descriptiontable7     left join descriptiontable8     left join descriptiontable9     left join descriptiontable10     left join descriptiontable11     left join descriptiontable12     left join descriptiontable13     left join descriptiontable14 codepre  pSince I am starting with my detail table and then joining the header is that less efficient than if I did it the other way around  I assumed since it was an inner join it wouldnt matter but like I said before I am not very knowledgeable on making queries more efficient.p  pMy idea is to create a separate table joining the header and detail together and then create a final table where I join the smaller detail tables.

Negative 65832 pIm attempting to create a table of polygon neighbors based on a Voronoi tessellation aka Dirichlet tessellations or Thiessen polygons generated by the codedirichletcode function of the codespatstatcode library. For example, in the figure below, the upper right and bottom right tiles would each have 2 neighbors, the center right tile 4 neighbors, and the remaining two tiles 3 neighbors each.

Negative 65832 pIm trying to design as simple an interface as possible between 2 processes. 1 process needs to tell the other when certain events happen and transfer a double type. I am trying to avoid Windows system code wherever possible since it is always ugly. p  pMy current design is to just have 1 process write to a file and to have the other read the file each are running at around 20 Hz. The writing process will just open a stdfstream in append mode and write stuff to it. The other process will open this file, read it, and then clear its contents.p  pWhat is the best way to try to open the file such that if one process has the file open the other process will wait From reading the documentation it looks like I will have iteratively attempt to call fstreamopen until it succeeds succeeding meaning that the failbit is not set on the return and no stdexceptions that are thrown. I would like to avoid using a crossprocess mutex given their cost and the fact that collisions should be fairly rare. Is this a sufficiently safe way to handle a file interface like this If it makes any difference this will be deployed on a machine with an SSD.p

Negative 65832 pstrongUPDATEDstrong Im specifically interested in how I run or roll back to a specific version of the binary image from docker, and have tried to clarify this question to that effect.  p  pThe a hrefhttpsdocs.docker.comfaqDocker FAQa it says p  blockquote   pDocker includes gitlike capabilities for tracking successive versions of a container, inspecting the diff between versions, committing new versions, rolling back etc. The history also includes how a container was assembled and by whom, so you get full traceability from the production server all the way back to the upstream developer.p blockquote  pGoogle as I may, I can find no example of rolling back to an earlier container, inspecting differences, etc.  Obviously I can do such things for versionmanaged Dockerfiles, but the binary Docker image  container can change even when the Dockerfile does not, due to updated software sources, and Im looking for a way to see and roll back between such changes.  p  pFor a basic example imagine I run p  precodedocker build t myimage . codepre  pon a Dockerfile that just updates the base ubuntup  precodeFROM ubuntu1404 RUN aptget update q ampamp aptget upgrade y codepre  pIf I build this same image a few days later, how can I diff these images to see what packages have been upgraded  How can I roll back to the earlier version of the image after rerunning the same build command later p

Negative 65832 pI want to group several methods. These methods do not contain any class data, so are therefore static. PHP has 2 options to do this by putting them in a namespace or in a class.

Negative 65832 pIm building my own behaviour tree system to handle the AI for an ecosystem simulator. What Im finding is that the naive approach I was taking is proving terrible for maximizing code reuse. For example, the creation of a simple routine to get a creature to walk to and eat the nearest vegetationp  precodenew Sequence     new MoveToClosestTree,     new EatClosestTree  codepre  pcodeClosestTreecode is a Tree variable stored in the Creatures codeContextcode object. This sequence is created in the Creature codeInitialisecode routine, and called later on. p  pThis works, but what about carnivores I end up needing to create another two routine classes to act on the codeClosestCorpsecode variablep  precodenew Sequence     new MoveToClosestCorpse,     new EatClosestCorpse  codepre  pSo this is a poor implementation. I dont want to have to create new sets of routines every time a contextual parameter changes.p  pI considered passing the context objects themselves into the routinesp  precodenew Sequence     new MoveTocontextRef.ClosestTree,     new EatcontextRef.ClosestTree  codepre  p... but I realised this could easily cause a scenario where codeClosestTreecode could be nullified in Context, but still remain and be used in the storage of all the Behaviour Tree Routines.p  pI then replaced the Context object with a codeDictionaryltstring, objectgtcode class. This was a little better, allowing me to pass in reference stringsp  precodenew Sequence     new MoveToClosestTree,     new EatClosestTree  codepre  p... but I quicky came to miss the type safety and designtime debugging of the explicit objects. If I make a typo in one of the more obscure fallback routines in the tree, I might not find out about it for months.p  pFinally, I considered using Strongly Typed Accessors for values in the codeDictionaryltstring, objectgtcode. Unfortunately, this also gives you the same problem as before if codeClosestTreecode is nullified, the codeMoveTocode routine would maintain a reference to it.p  pIm not sure what my next approach is going to be, though I have an idea it may involve whatever Cs equivalent of pointers is unfamiliar territory for me, as Ive never used C or pointers. Before I dig into that, however, I thought Id askp  pDoes anyone know how I can implement Strongly Typed parameters in a Behaviour Treep

Negative 65832 pI have a situation where it seems IIS keeps quite a lot of memory related to sessions, even though sessions expire. We have a physical memory limit set on IIS to 1GB, and a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms178586vvs.100.aspx relnofollowstore the session information inside the IIS worker process InProca. p  pIf I run the application locally using IIS 7.5 and click around in the application monitoring the memory by using the Windows Task Manager which seems to generally speaking not be a good idea to measure memory usage I can see the memory of the codew3wp.execode process increases rapidly. I can pretty easily reach a couple of hundered MBs by clicking around in the application. Note that the memory is emnotem constantly increasing, it just never seems to be released.p  pWhenever I decide to close the browser and the session eventually expires, I see no memory reduction at the Windows Task Manager. I guess this could be fine, in case the Windows Task Manager shows the reserved memory by the CLR.p  pHowever, assuming the CLR just reserves memory, I can see that as a fine behaviour, but the problem is that IIS reaches the top of the private memory limit, causing the application pool to recycle, which in turns causes all session information to be lost. This is not necessarily causing too much damage in this specific case, but I would like to know who eats the memory. Or why ASP.NET never releases it.p  pSince I was confindent that something was fishy with the session memory never being freed, I inserted this snippet of code into the codeSessionStartcode method on the codeGlobal.asacodex filep  precodeforint i  0 i lt 1000000 i     Session[Random location   i]  A simple string for testing purpose  codepre  pAll I wanted was to add some extra ammount of memory usage to the session, in order to verify that it actually was never freed. When the session timeouts I expect that allocated memory to be freed. Still Windows Task Manager shows a great bunch of memory being used in the codeMemory Private Working Setcode column. Again, as far as I understand a hrefhttpwindows.microsoft.comenuswindowswhattaskmanagermemorycolumnsmean1TCwindows7 relnofollowthis column could represent reserved memory as wella.p  pAnother important thing is that were a hrefhttpbrianreiter.org20100224overridepagestatepersistertoeliminateviewstate relnofollowstoring ViewState information inside the Sessiona using a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.web.ui.sessionpagestatepersistervvs.110.aspx relnofollowSessionPageStatePersistera. I first thought that this was the root cause, because we filled the session with ViewState data and it seemed like session information was never really freed. However im not so sure anymore that this is the problem. p  pI tried to use the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms178586vvs.100.aspx relnofollowASP.NET StateServicea in an attempt to see how much information was actually used by the session, and clearly this process codeaspnetstate.execode inside the Windows Task Manager does not take too much memory, w3wp.exe is the one using memory at least reserving.p  pI have created a dump file out of the codew3wp.execode process and used a hrefhttpwww.microsoft.comenusdownloaddetails.aspxid42933 relnofollowDebugDiaga in order to understand what takes memory, but im not very familiar with it and therefore I cannot interpret all values correctly yet.p  pA quick summary of the main issue I have is thatp  ol liThe AppPool recycles way too often, once per 1.5h ish.li liIm confident that this application with a limited amount of users should not be using this much memory and causing recycles this often.li ol  pAny guidance is very much appreciatedp

I followed a hrefhttpwww.delphifeeds.comgos88917 relnofollowthisa article, which uses both TStringList and TFIleStream to remove this, but instead of giving me a full textfile, the result is empty. Please could you help save the data rather than not storing it at all Thanks a lot. Here is a part of my procedure.p  precodevar   EmailText  TStringList   FileStream  TFileStream begin   FileName  email1.txt   EmailText  TStringList.Create   FileStream  TFileStream.CreateFilename, fmCreate              EmailText.SaveToStreamFileStream, EmailText.Encoding   FileStream.Size  FileStream.Size  LengthSystem.sLineBreak              EmailText.AddEmailMessageMemo.Text                               FileStream.Free   EmailText.Free codepre
Negative 65832 pI have a TextView with some text in it, and I would like to change the last word.p  pWhat I find difficult is animating the change, with, lets say, a fading animation, without fading the other words too.

I tried using codeliteralcolumncode to execute this as a raw SQL and that didnt work out as it gave an error saying that it couldnt find the columns codestarttimecode and codetimezonenamecode when they do in fact exist. So I suppose that isnt very useful here. I also tried to find any functions but all of those that were related to time and timezone only seemed to convert between UTC and system time which isnt very useful to me.p  pHow can this be donep

Negative 65832 pMy company have a library of integrations with a generic front. One of our products is a simple web booking working and with our integration library we can add appointments in several external systems  from Microsoft Exchange and Google Calendar to appointment registers in EMR systems. We have a total of 28 integrations in this library.p  pThis is a simplified example of how some of the time requests are handled for integrations to SystemA and SystemB.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comj9Hhs.png altenter image description herep  pThe parameters to codeGetTimescode are actually bundled in a codeGetTimesParameterscode object, but presented here as separate input parameters. p  pTo use the integration library we have a simple factory method returning an codeImplementationBasecode object and an extension library to convert the ImplementationBase object to different interfacesp  precode Create ImplementationBase object var implementation  ImplementationFactory.CreateImplementationEnum.SystemA   Set implementation connection data implementation.SetConnection...   Get an ITime object var timeImplementation  implementation.AsTime   Get the times from today and two days forward var times  timeImplementation.GetTimesDateTime.Today, DateTime.Today.AddDays2 codepre  pThe codeAsTimecode extension method throws a specific exception if the interface is not implemented by the implementation. p  pThis has been working good enough, but its getting a bit hard to maintain.p  pSimple validation is one thing. In the codeGetTimescode call we check if the codefromcode DateTime is before the codetocode DateTime  this is made by all codeGetTimecode implementations.p  pAnother problem is how not implemented methods are handled. The codeGetTimescode and codeGetTimeTypescode methods are almost always used together. But in one integration there are no time types. The method codeGetTimeTypescode throws a codeImplementationMethodNotSupportedExceptioncode and the codetimeTypeIdcode parameter in codeGetTimescode is ignored.p  pIm sure there are other problems, but these two came to mind just right now and the validation problem is causing the most headaches. p  pI want a new layer on top of this. Where common validation can be handled and perhaps where the application can override behaviors  like handle an codeImplementationMethodNotSupportedExceptioncode in the codeGetTimeTypescode example as returning an empty list of time types.p  pBut Im not sure how to do it. Any suggestions to improve our approach or a complete remodel would be greatp

This is a proof of concept before we buy the iTextSharp license.p  pSo here is the background.  I am working on a web forms web application written in vb.net.  I open a new browser window to display the PDF in an iframe.  The PDF contains form fields, which the user can fill out.  At the bottom of the form, there will be a submit button to process the form and a save progress button to save their current changes.  After the form is processedsaved, its supposed to redirect to an HTML page that says Form Submitted Successfully.  I have this all working in Google Chrome, but its not doing the redirect to the HTML page in IE.  p  pWe will be getting LOTS of PDFs from our customers.  When I create the PDF forms in Acrobat, I add the 2 buttons to the bottom of the PDF.  This ensures the correct placement of the buttons, based on where it fits for that PDF.  So the buttons will always have the same names, btnSaveProgress and btnProcessForm.p  pIn the codebehind for the source of the iframe, I have this iTextSharp codep  precodeUsing myPdfReader As New PdfReaderstrFullFilePathName     Context.Response.Clear     Context.Response.ContentType  applicationpdf      Using stamper As PdfStamper  New PdfStampermyPdfReader, Response.OutputStream        stamper.ViewerPreferences  PdfWriter.HideToolbar        Dim hostUrl As String  Request.Url.GetLeftPartUriPartial.Authority        Dim btnArray As String  btnSaveProgress, btnProcessForm        Dim intCounter  0         For Each btnName As String In btnArray            Dim saveButtonField As PushbuttonField  stamper.AcroFields.GetNewPushbuttonFromFieldbtnName            Dim pff As PdfFormField  saveButtonField.Field            Dim myAction As PdfAction  PdfAction.CreateSubmitForm....CommonServicesStaticFormSubmissionHandler.ashxsubmissionType amp intCounter amp ampformID amp intFormID amp ampresultID amp intResultID amp amptemplateName amp Server.UrlEncodesShortName, Nothing, PdfAction.SUBMITEXCLFKEY            myAction.NextNew PdfActionhostUrl amp MainPagesFormSub.htm                     pff.SetAdditionalActionsPdfName.U, myAction            pff.Action  myAction            stamper.AcroFields.ReplacePushbuttonFieldbtnName, pff            intCounter  1        Next     End Using End Using codepre  pThe saveprocess submission works, but the redirect only works in Chrome.  In IE, it makes the iframe blank.  Im not seeing any errors or anything.  Also, in IE, the PDF has the menu bars displayed.

But it would be nice if the codestamper.ViewerPreferences  PdfWriter.HideToolbarcode would work.p  pThank you so much in advance for any adviceinput.p

However if you follow these instructions and use a script to dynamically update the feed the row will not be removed.p  pOr is there a way to replace all values within the data feed from a scriptp  pI will be happy with either solution or just the documentation with the correct syntax on how to accomplish this.p  pThanks in advance, Stephenp  pLinks Ad Customizer a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comadwordsscriptsdocssolutionscustomizer relnofollowhttpsdevelopers.google.comadwordsscriptsdocssolutionscustomizerap  pManage ads and feeds in Business data a hrefhttpssupport.google.comadwordsanswer6072708hlen relnofollowhttpssupport.google.comadwordsanswer6072708hlenap

Negative 65832 pI am trying to understand how the boostasioioservice works. Here is what I think  p  pAn instance of the boostasioioservice internally implements an event based queue, such that events posted to the queue are handled by threads implementing the ioservicerun method. The advantage of using this as against a normal queue is that ioservice is asynchronous, so there is no need to waste CPU cycles polling for events in the queue. p  pIf the above is correct, then what would happen if there are fewer threads available to handle the work event and the rate at which work is posted to ioservice is too high. p  pAt some point, when this queue becomes full, would the post block p  pMy intention is to have a nonblocking post against the ioservice. If the post isnt successful, I want to discard the work event. p  pLooking for some advise.p  pThanksp

Negative 65832 pI am working for on a project its target is to make it possible for my companies software to be plugin compatible. The main target is to make the footprint of our software a lot smaller.p  pWe achieved the software part by splitting the program in different elementary Cores and Plugins. The Cores define the Side Client  Server  Remote CheckInOut Location  Management  Processing. The plugins define the behaviour  of the software. Do you just want Personal Management Fine than just take the Persons and Workplace Plugins Do you want to manage who enters the building than add the RemoteIO and Keys Plugins to the list. And so forth. For up to in total 40 different plugins. Most of them can be used in any combination a buyer likes There are some dependencies but there are not much.p  pSo for small firms the software can be really lightweight. But the DB is still HUGE with nearly 400 Tables it has to manage, most of them are not even used when only the smallest version is sold. To make that smaller we are looking for ways on how to make the DB Pluginable, so that only the tables, columns, keys, indexes, foreign keys etc. that are needed by at least one of the active plugins are there on the Server side. On top of that we have to make sure that we can update the DB easily if we ever wanted to change it.p  pstrongSo my question is Does any of you have experience with making a DB Pluginable When yes How did you solve the issue And what tools should i take a look at Or should i write them myselfstrongp  pThe Framework for the system is Windows, Windows Server 2003 or higher, SQL Server either MSSQL or InformixDB2, Entity Framework 6.1 for MSSQL 5 for InformixDB2, .Net Framework 3 or Higher If available, WPF, WCF.p  pGreets,p  pMarcp

Negative 65832 pI need to access plans that are defined in Rational Team Concert Change and configuration management using the REST API provided by RTC. I am able to access work items, but cannot find URLs and definition how to access plans and query information from them.p  pSpecifically, I want to retrieve the number of completed hours and planned hours of a plan. These values are shown in the Current... widget on the dashboard, the widget that shows all current plans.p  pThe reason why I need to retrieve these values is to create a chart which displays the number of completed hours on a time line.

Negative 65832 pThis is happening when I use a more recent version of wsimport. The example WSDL below contains a SimpleType SomeEnum that becomes an enum in the JAXB class. I have some code that generates the XSD schema back from the JAXB class and previously it would correctly assign the type tnsSomeEnum to this element but now treats it as string.p  pI eventually discovered that wsimport was adding the annotation  XmlSchemaTypename  string, causing this behavior. This seems wrong to me, because there is a more specific type than string. It is also breaking code that depends on backgenerating the schema.p  pHere is the smallest WSDL I could come up with to reproduce the error.p  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingUTF8gt ltwsdldefinitions   targetNamespacehttpfoo.bar.comexample   xmlnstnshttpfoo.bar.comexample   xmlnswsdlhttpschemas.xmlsoap.orgwsdl   xmlnswsdlsoaphttpschemas.xmlsoap.orgwsdlsoap xmlnsxsdhttpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchemagt    ltwsdltypesgt     ltschema elementFormDefaultqualified jaxbversion1.0       targetNamespacehttpfoo.bar.comexample       xmlnshttpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchema       xmlnsjaxbhttpjava.sun.comxmlnsjaxb xmlnstnshttpfoo.bar.comexamplegt       ltannotationgt         ltappinfogt           ltjaxbglobalBindings typesafeEnumMaxMembers999999gt         ltappinfogt       ltannotationgt       ltcomplexType nameWrappergt         ltsequencegt           ltelement maxOccurs1 minOccurs0 namesomeEnum typetnsSomeEnumgt         ltsequencegt       ltcomplexTypegt       ltsimpleType nameSomeEnumgt         ltrestriction basexsdstringgt           ltenumeration valueSOMEVALUEgt           ltenumeration valueANOTHERVALUEgt         ltrestrictiongt       ltsimpleTypegt       ltelement namedoesNothinggt         ltcomplexTypegt           ltsequencegt           ltsequencegt         ltcomplexTypegt       ltelementgt     ltschemagt   ltwsdltypesgt    ltwsdlmessage namedoesNothingRequestgt     ltwsdlpart elementtnsdoesNothing nameparametersgt   ltwsdlmessagegt    ltwsdlportType nameSimpleTypeIssueServiceInterfacegt     ltwsdloperation namedoesNothinggt       ltwsdlinput messagetnsdoesNothingRequest namedoesNothingRequestgt     ltwsdloperationgt   ltwsdlportTypegt   ltwsdlbinding nameSimpleTypeIssueServiceSoapBinding typetnsSimpleTypeIssueServiceInterfacegt     ltwsdlsoapbinding styledocument transporthttpschemas.xmlsoap.orgsoaphttpgt     ltwsdloperation namedoesNothinggt       ltwsdlsoapoperation soapActiongt       ltwsdlinput namedoesNothingRequestgt         ltwsdlsoapbody useliteralgt       ltwsdlinputgt     ltwsdloperationgt   ltwsdlbindinggt   ltwsdlservice nameSimpleTypeIssueServicegt     ltwsdlport bindingtnsSimpleTypeIssueServiceSoapBinding nameSimpleTypeIssueServiceInterfacePortgt       ltwsdlsoapaddress locationLOCATIONTEMPLATEgt     ltwsdlportgt   ltwsdlservicegt codepre  pAnd here is a fragment of the generated Wrapper.java.

Negative 65832 pI am having an issue with trying to bind a codeComboBoxcode in WinRT.  I am using PrismMVVM.  I am able to bind the codeItemsSourcecode to an codeObservableCollectioncode no problem, and the codeComboBoxcode is being populated.p  pWhat I am having trouble with, is having it automatically select the appropriate value based on the current codeInvoicecode.  Here is the relevant XAMLp  precodeltComboBox Grid.Row0 Grid.Column1 Height30            ItemsSourceBinding PathPayees           DisplayMemberPathAccountName           SelectedValuePathPayeeId           SelectedValueBinding CurrentInvoice.PayeeId, ModeTwoWay           Margin5,0,10,0 gt codepre  pcodePayeescode is my codeObservableCollectioncode and codeCurrentInvoicecode is a property on the codeViewModelcode that points to the currently loaded codeInvoicecode item.  The codeInvoicecode has a property called codePayeeIdcode, which as you may guess, is the codeIdcode of the codePayeecode that this codeInvoicecode is associated to.p  pFor some reason, no matter which codeInvoicecode I select, the codeComboBoxcode is blank when I navigate to my page.  By blank, I just mean there is nothing selected, but it is populated with the codePayeescode collection.p  pIf I manually change the selection, and save my codeInvoicecode, the codePayeeIdcode isnt changed.  I think that it probably has something to do with the binding on the codeSelectedValuecode, but so far I have been unable to figure this one out.  Thanks in advance for any helpp  pHere are the properties for the codePayeescode and codeCurrentInvoicecodep  precodeprivate Invoice currentInvoice public Invoice CurrentInvoice      get  return currentInvoice      set  SetPropertyref currentInvoice, value     private ObservableCollectionltPayeegt payees public ObservableCollectionltPayeegt Payees      get  return payees      set  SetPropertyref payees, value   codepre  pstrongEDITstrongp  pI have added a property on the codeViewModelcode called codeSelectedPayeecode that is bound to the codeSelectedItemcode property of the codeComboBoxcode.  Here is the updated definitionp  precodeltComboBox Grid.Row0 Grid.Column1 Height30            ItemsSourceBinding PathPayees           DisplayMemberPathAccountName           SelectedValuePathId           SelectedItemBinding PathSelectedPayee, ModeTwoWay           Margin5,0,10,0 gt codepre  pWhen I select a codePayeecode and save, it saves with the new codePayeeIdcode, but when I load the page it still does not load with the codeSelectedPayeecode displayed in the codeComboBoxcode.  However, all is well in the designer.  To further test, I have added a codeTextBoxcode that is bound to codeSelectedPayee.Idcodep  precodeltTextBox Grid.Row7 Grid.Column1 TextBinding PathSelectedPayee.Id gt codepre  pThat displayed the correct number at design time and runtime, and is updated appropriately whenever I change the selection in the codeComboBoxcode.  The only thing that is not working correctly is the codeComboBoxcode is not correctly displaying the codePayeecode codeAccountNamecode when I navigate to the page.  As I said, the design view is correctly displaying the dummy data that I have in my designer codeViewModelcode.  Is there something special about a codeComboBoxcode that I am perhaps doing something in the wrong orderp  pstrongEDIT 2strongp  pI also am getting the exact same results using p  precodeSelectedValueBinding PathSelectedPayee.Id, ModeTwoWay codepre  pThe binding is displaying the correct codePayee.Idcode in the codeTextBoxcode depending on which codePayeecode is selected in the codeComboBoxcode, but it just does not display the codeSelectedPayeecode when I first navigate to the page but the codeTextBoxcode will be populated with the correct codeIdcode.  This is really a head scratcher to me....p  pstrongEDIT 3strongp  pI got it all straightened out.  The final issue I had going was I was setting the codeSelectedPayeecode before actually loading the codeComboBoxcode, so there was no property changes to trigger the codeSelectedValuecode of the codeComboBoxcode to change.  Once I moved the call to codeLoadPayeescode above the assignment to codeSelectedValuecode, everything works like a charm.  strongSee answer below.strongp
Negative 65832 pWe are working on an integration project with BizTalk 2013 with the Host Integration Services 2013.  The purpose is to provide integration with an AS400 server. As part of the integration some Stored Procedures need to be called on AS400. p  pHowever we are struggling with setting up the call to this Stored Procedure.p  pThe test Stored Procedure we use inserts 1 record into a file. And does not have any parameters.p  pWe have isolated the issue from the BizTalk environment and are using a very simple Console Application in Visual Studio to reproduce the problem.p  pWe generate a DataSet xsd to wrap the Stored Procedure into a client.  When we use a connection string with the IBM DB2 for i5OSIBMDA400 OLE DB Provider, calling the Stored Procedure works without any issues. If we use the Microsoft OLE DB Provider for DB2DB2OLEDB Provider then calling the Stored Procedure does not do anything. In both cases 1 is returned as result.p  pWhen we create a Query TableAdapter object in the DataSet for the Stored Procedure with the DB2OLEDB2 provider the result of the Wizard reports a Catastrophic failure at the end.  However, a method has been created and looking at the generated code, it appears to be fine. Doing the same with the IBMDA400 generateds a method without any errors.p  pHas anyone had similar issues with the DB2OLEDB Provider or can suggest which parameters we need to look at on the connection string in order to help us.p

Negative 65832 pI am testing PyCharm as IDE for my ArcPy needs. I have been testing it on how to set up the interpreters. I am using ArcGIS 10.2.2 with 64 bit background geoprocessing installed, therefore I have two Pythons, one 32 bit and another 64. I understand it shouldnt be a big deal, other than selecting the one you want to use.p  pPlaying around on the project interpreter window I added again the 32 bit one, so its now duplicated. I tried to remove the duplicate, but that would remove both 32 bit interpreter instances. When I ad again the 32 bit interpreter, the two instances appear again. So I am unable to have only one 32 bit interpreter Why is this happening Can anyone help me to remove this duplicate [Using PyCharm Community Edition 4.0.4]p

Negative 65832 pMediaPlayer  Can MediaElement be improved to support more media formats and encodings p  pCodecs support.p  pHello all. p  pI am building a media player in strongcstrong and strongWPFstrong.  All the examples that I find, more or less say the same thing,  place a mediaElement and the basic player buttons and there you gop  pI thought that the mediaElement is essentially the windows media player,  but I already found cases where videos play, but show a black screen, while the audio track plays normally, and others where the scrubbing on the timeline takes a lot of time. Also I noticed that when I load a video in this type of player, strongKlite codecsstrong doesnt seem to load on the bottom right part of the windows taskbar like they usually do when I use VLC player or Media Player Classic for example. p  pI ve already found another topic stating that  emThe MediaElement is a control thats able to play only some file types. Its based on media player of windows but only on its core encoders. Its basically a barebones media playeremp  pDo the issues I am having with the video playback have to do with limited codec support Is it enough that I have Klite codecs installed or is there something else that I am missingp  pLastly, in the case that this is as good as mediaElement gets, what alternatives are there I ve seen people open VLC through their players,  but I would like to know what other alternatives are available as well before I dive into that. I ve seen that Microsoft now has strongPlayer Frameworkstrong available for Windows 8 for example, but is it only for windows 8p  pThank you all in advancep

Negative 65832 pIm trying to understand clockreset in a chip. In a design what criteria are used to decide whether a flop should be assigned to a value typically to zero during reset p  precodealwaysff posedge clk or negedge reset begin  processwreset    ifreset begin       flop1 lt 0       ....    end else begin       if condition begin          flop1 lt something           ....        end    end end  alwaysff posedge clk begin  processworeset       if condition begin          flop1 lt something           ....        end end codepre  pIs it a bad practice to not to reset a flop which is used later as a control signal in a comb logic What if the design makes sure that the flop will have a valid value 0 or 1 assigned to it before its used in a comb logic block i.e. in a if statement or in FSM comb logic p  pI feel like its better to always reset all the flops in the design. In that way there wont be any Xs after reset in the chip. However, it seems like for datapath logic, resetting flop might need not be a big deal as itll be just pipe stages. However if a flop is in control path i.e. FSM next state comb logic then it should be reset to a default value. Is my understanding correct I dont know much about DFT and not sure if it has any other implication. p

Instead, calling a modal would act as if a transparent component was added on top of the page I mean, with the highest zindex, stealing the focus in the same way that a modal would do. As a consequence, the modal itself is not displayed and the page does not respond to any click event assuming the fake modal is locking the focus.p  pThe content of my modals is loaded via codengincludecode directives and it seems to work from what I can see in the network tool of Chrome. There are no error message complaining about a missing resource in the console and the only thing I can think of is that the code responsible for toggling the modals visibility in codemobileangularuicode was somehow impacted by the build process. Sounds possiblep  pAny idea of what could cause this difference of behaviour between dev and productionp  pI am using codemobileangularuicode 1.2.0beta.11. Feel free to request more information.p

Negative 65832 pNow that codegulpwebservercode and codegulpconnectcode have both been blacklisted one as a duplicate of the other, the other as use the connect module directly, it seems we need to hook up our own servers to use with codeconnectcodecodeexpresscodecodenewserverofthedaycode. I decided to use this opportunity to create a plugin based on codegulpwebservercode. This will not be an official codegulpcode plugin, as it would probably get blacklisted itself, and it will be more tailored to my own projects, not generalpurpose.p  pWhile codegulpwebservercode uses the codeservestaticcode middleware to serve files, I decided to try serving codevinylcode files created earlier in the pipeline. I am also using codeexpresscode, rather than codeconnectcode, as codeexpresscode has more features that I need. I am essentially looping over the files, taking the contents of the current file codefile.contentscode serving them at the files path codepath.relativeprocess.cwd, file.pathcode or something similar, then passing them through unchanged.p  pHere is a simplified version of what I havep  precodevar server  function      var express  requireexpress     var files  []      var app  express      return through.objfunctionfile, enc, cb          this.pushfile         cb          .ondata, functionfile          files.pushfile          app.usefunctionreq, res, next              forlet file of files                  ifreq.path  path.relativeprocess.cwd, file.path                      return res.sendfile.contents                                             if no file found, go to the next middleware             return next                   .onend, function          app.listensomePort      codepre  pAt its heart, codegulpwebservercode is not much different from this, except that it serves real files while this will serve codevinylcode files. It works well when files will not change. However, I am having trouble with what to do when they emdoem change. For example, how do I send changes along when codelivereloadcode gets involved I cant send codevinylcode files back along the pipeline. I could kill the server and start a new one, but that seems too slow, especially if I have a lot of files and middleware.p  pWhat should I do in the case where I am using a codevinylcode file, change it in a later codepipecode, and need to use that change in an earlier codepipecode How do I propagate the changes back, or what should I do insteadp  pBonus Is this a good idea codegulpwebservercode and codegulpconnectcode get their files from the filesystem every time, rather than using files that are passed to them. Is this just for convenience, or is it a bad idea in general to use files from earlier in the pipeline I realize that on watch, the codevinylcode files will reflect the actual files more closely, which defeats most of the reason for using them, but it seems like this would be faster than going to the filesystem every time.

Negative 65832 pI am trying to create a sprite parent class that uses some of it methods to filter out some of the dud conditions by returning null prior to moving onto the child method.

It is like both of the update methods are being treated as separate functions.p  pI believe i need a way to append the child update method to the child update method.  I am hoping there is a simple way of achieving this but will accept complicated solutions as long as i dont have to write the bouncerfilter code in every child class.p  pAny help is much appreciated.p  pJasonp    pAlternative solutionp  pProposed code    class parent               public void update                       if this.countlt0                                return                             do parent stuff              childupdatep  precode         childupdate               place hold to be overridden by child       class child extends parent       Override     private void childupdate               do child stuff here       codepre  pI think this solves my problem but havent had chance to test it yet.  When i call the child object update method it should be directed to the parent method, which performs the bouncervalidation checks and if applicable runs the child update that has been overridden by the child method.The child method would be set to private so it cant be called without the validation checks.p  pI personally think this is a cleaner solution than the boolean solution being proposed but would like to know what other people think.  p  pthanksp  pJason p

Negative 65832 pI thought I am doing a standard operation when trying to delete several objects of a model at once with a DeleteView and the POST method, having a confirmation template in between.p  pWell, either I am sitting too long in front of the computer or this supposedly standard way is not directly supported by Django.p  pAs a hrefhttpsdocs.djangoproject.comendevrefclassbasedviewsgenericeditingdeleteview relnofollowDjangos docsa and other posts say, a confirmation template is only shown with a Confirmation button if I use a GET method. But in my case I have a ListView with all my objects of my model and the first column being the checkboxes whose values correspond to the respective objects IDs. I can check several checkboxes at once and then click on my Delete selected items. The form uses the POST method I dont want to use GET.p  pNow Getting a DeleteView to work with a confirmation template in case of a POST method seems to cause a little of a hack.

Negative 65832 pAs should be evident from the code below, I have a ScrollViewer whose only two children are two TreeViews. Each TreeView consists of one TreeViewItem, which itself contains a ListBox. The ListBoxs items are dynamically generated. Its quite convoluted, but I havent thought of anything better yet, so there it is.

It seems to me that I would be able to traverse up the tree from within an event to control the scrolling, but I am at a loss for what that might be. Also, if theres a simpler way to achieve the exact same result visually than having to go 5 controls deep, I am open to that suggestion as wellp

Negative 65832 pDLL Visual Studio 2013VC12  App Visual Studio 2010VC10p  pI am creating a library that allows a client access to our system. However it appears that when deleting an array of pointers returned from the dll then the client application crashes. When deleting a normal pointer non array everything seems to work fine.

Negative 65832 pI was just asking myself a question about how to pass data across a ViewPager. p  pBasically, I have 3 fragments on my view pager which will all need data from the same USER object that i created. When the app is launch, my user will arrive on the viewpager and all the fields of the user object will be populated but i want them to persist across swiping on the viewpager.p  pMy question is the following  What is the best practice in android for passing data along the fragments of the viewPager p  pI guess the lazy way would be to create the object field and keep it in the viewPager activity but is it good style  Or do I have to save it everytime I quit a fragment and retrieve it on the next fragment as it can be quite a pain... You see what I mean p  pMany thanks for your help,p  pPaulp
Negative 65832 pI am using vertx3. p  pAs we know Vertx is very efficient handling many requests with its reactor pattern.p  pThe thing is that I have a second service which exposed as RestAPI on Springboot containerit was very easy for me to implement it over there.p  pI got two options 1. Implement that logic on vertx and earn the api call.                    2. Scale the springboot service to handle those millions rest apis reuqests from vertx.p  pAnyone had this dilema  p  pwill be easier to go with option two.p  pAny alternative how to scale the spring service   I already aware to the physical solutions of adding many instances on diff machines and put loadbalancers but than I am losing the power of vertx since the springservice is a bottleneck p  pThanks, ray.p
