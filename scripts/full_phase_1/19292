Positive 19292 pIm trying to use a function to assign space and fill that space or at least some of it with characters to form a string. Within the function I make a call to malloc, and within the same function I assign characters to the given space. The following code gives the general gist of what Im doingp  precodedefine INITIAL 10  int funcchar s  int mainint argc, char argv      char s     int n      n  funcamps     printfDonen      return 0   int funcchar s      int i      s  charmallocINITIALsizeofchar     asserts      for i0 ilt5 i          printfidn, i         s[i]  a a is an arbitrary char for this example             return i      codepre  pThe output of this code isp  precodei0 i1 i2 Segmentation fault 11 codepre  pThe reason I have my function return an int is because I ultimately want the function to return the length of the string I have formed.br Im completely unsure why I am getting a segmentation fault it seems I have assigned enough space to fit the next char in. It also seems weird to me that it stops at i2. If anyone could identify the mistakes I have made I would greatly appreciate it p

Positive 19292 pMy goal is to create an event handling infrastructure that will allow for registration of callback functions and calls to such functions based on time. Further, I plan to make the callback handler multithreaded as there are no restrictions on the type of callbacks, so a sequential architecture could cause unwanted blocking.p  pFrom my research I found that if a thread experiences undefined behavior and is terminated .i.e. with SIGSEGV then the entire process exits  which is obviously undesirable. p  pThe question, then, is what options are there for ensuring thread independence I do not think codeforkcodeing is a viable  option in this case since the callbacks are not fully fledged programs, but rather simple routines to do various timebased tasks.p

So the output for codefile1.txtcode should be p  precode5 12 codepre  pI finished all the steps of this program, but it always give me a segmentation faultcore dumped and I have no idea which part I am wrong. p  precodeincludeltstdio.hgt includeltstdlib.hgt includeltstring.hgt   struct node    create the node structure      int data     struct node next   int insertstruct node root, int n int deletestruct node root, int n void printstruct node root  int mainint argc, char argv[100] start with empty linked list      struct node root  NULL  if the input is more than one, error     ifargc1              printferrorn         return 1        argv[1] will contain the file name input.      scanfs,argv     FILE file  fopenargv, r  check if the file exit      if file  NULL              printferrorn         return 1        if the file is empty, print an empty line.     fseekfile,0,SEEKEND     int size  ftellfile     if size  0         printfn         return 0       read the file     int k     fork0kltsizek              printfhi         char letter         int number         int n         fscanffile,c d, letter, number          ifletter  i            convert the pointer to its location           numberampn           insertamproot,n               else                  numberampn           deleteamproot,n               printamproot   fclosefile     insertion at front  int insertstruct node root, int n  node should be inserted      struct node newnode  struct node mallocsizeofstruct node       ifrootNULL  if the list is empty   rootnewnode   else     newnodegtdatan     newnodegtnextroot     rootnewnode        int deletestruct node root, int n      ifrootNULL       return 0   struct node temp  root   iftempgtdata  n        iftempgtnext              root  tempgtnext          freetemp   whiletempgtnext      struct node delete  tempgtnext     iftempgtnextgtnext ampamp tempgtnextgtdata  n              delete next                     tempgtnext  tempgtnextgtnext         freedelete           else iftempgtnextgtdata  n              the last node         tempgtnext  NULL         freedelete           temp  tempgtnext                 void printstruct node root  first count current node in the list     struct node p  root     int c0     whilepNULL            ppgtnext       c     use c get above to do a selection sort   int i,j,temp   struct node prev, curr, t   prevroot    fori0iltc1i          currprevgtnext       forji1jltcj                  ifprevgtdata gt currgtdata                          tempprevgtdata               prevgtdatacurrgtdata               currgtdatatemp                      currcurrgtnext              prevprevgtnext     print the linked list   troot   whiletNULL          printfd,tgtdata       ttgtnext       printft     codepre

Each child component has properties bound to the Model and functions that call Cairngorm Events.p  pHeres an simplified examplep  precodeFiltersAccordion.mxml ltxml version1.0 encodingutf8gt ltmxAccordion xmlnsmxhttpwww.adobe.com2006mxml     xmlnslocalgt     ltmxScriptgt         lt[CDATA[             import model.ModelLocator              [Bindable]             private var modelModelLocator  ModelLocator.getInstance         ]]gt     ltmxScriptgt      ltlocalGenreFilter availableGenresmodel.availableGenres           selectedGenresmodel.selectedGenres gt      ltlocalArtistFilter availableArtistsmodel.availableArtists           selectedArtistsmodel.selectedArtists gt      ltlocalLabelFilter availableLabelsmodel.availableLabels           selectedLabelsmodel.selectedLabels gt ltmxAccordiongt   GenreFilter.mxml  ltxml version1.0 encodingutf8gt ltmxHBox xmlnsmxhttpwww.adobe.com2006mxmlgt     ltmxScriptgt         lt[CDATA[             import control.events.AddGenresEvent             import control.events.RemoveGenresEvent              import model.ModelLocator              [Bindable]             private var modelModelLocator  ModelLocator.getInstance              [Bindable]             public var availableGenresArrayCollection              [Bindable]             public var selectedGenresArrayCollection              private function addGenresButtonclickHandlervoid                              var eventAddGenresEvent  new AddGenresEvent                  event.availableGenres  availableGenres                  event.selectedGenres  selectedGenres                  event.itemsToAdd  availableGenresList.selectedItems                  event.dispatch                           protected function removeGenresButtonclickHandlervoid                              var eventRemoveGenresEvent  new RemoveGenresEvent                  event.availableGenres  availableGenres                  event.selectedGenres  selectedGenres                  event.itemsToRemove  selectedGenresList.selectedItems                  event.dispatch                       ]]gt     ltmxScriptgt      ltmxList idavailableGenresList dataProvideravailableGenres gt      ltmxVBoxgt          ltmxButton idaddButton iconrightArrowIcon width22              height22 clickaddGenresButtonclickHandler gt           ltmxButton idremoveButton iconleftArrowIcon width22               height22 clickremoveGenresButtonclickHandler gt      ltmxVBoxgt       ltmxList idselectedGenresList dataProviderselectedGenres           width100 height100 allowMultipleSelectiontrue gt ltmxHBoxgt codepre  pstrongArtistFilter.mxmlstrong and strongLabelFilter.mxmlstrong are pretty much the same design as strongGenreFilter.mxmlstrong, but use to their specific Events.p  pSo how should I do this It doesnt make sense to move my Model into the shared library.

Negative 19292 pWith a Qt DBus proxy built on QDbusAbstractInterface via qdbusxml2cpp, whats the best way to handle the serviceobject you want to interface to not being available when you start  Note Im not interested in simply knowing it you can use BlahService.isValid to find that out I want to be able to know if its valid, and know when it becomes valid so I can change state and broadcast that state change with a signal, and on that state change do other stuff.   Conversely, I want to know when its no longer valid for similar reasons.p  pWithout tracking the state of the servicep  precodedefine CONNECTDBUSSIGx,y connectblah,SIGNALx,this,SLOTy   FIX  should watch for service, and also handle it going away and  coming back blah  new BlahServicecom.xyzzy.BlahService, comxyzzyBlahService,                            QDBusConnectionsessionBus, this if blah     return 0 if blah.isValid      CONNECTDBUSSIGfoo,Eventfoo  else       Since we arent watching for registration, what can we do but exit  codepre  pProbably we need to watch for NameOwnerChanged on the DBus connection object  unless QTs dbus code does this for us  and then when we get that signal change state, and if needed connect or disconnect the signals from the object.p  pAll the examples I find either ignore the issue or simply exit if the server object doesnt exist, and dont deal with it going away.  The CarController Qt example at least notices if the server goes away and prints Disconnected if isValid becomes false during use, but its polling isValid.p  pAddedp  pNote that QtDbusAbtractInterface registers for changes of ownership of the server NameOwnerChanged, and updates isValid when changes occur.  So I suspect you can connect to that serverOwnerChanged signal directly to find out about changes to ownership and use that as an indicator to try again  though you wont be able to trust isValid since it may be updated before or after you get signaled.p  pAlternatively ugly you can set up a timer and poll for isValid.p

Negative 19292 pI have an app that uses Django with FCGI on nginx. Im using the thirdparty apps like James Bennetts djangoregistration and djangomessages from the Pinax Project. Both of these apps have forms that are submitted and save data into the database, then redirect on to a new URL.p  pMy issue seems to be that the .save method on any of the forms in these apps cause a 504 gateway timeout when the forms are submitted. All of the data is saved in the database as it should be, however neither seems to ever return anything to the app after the form is saved.p  pIve done some logging at various points in the code and there are no errors. Its as if the save methods on the form or the models the forms are connected to simply never return anythingerror or otherwise.p  pWith this lack of detail, an answer might be a dream for me, but just a nudge in the right direction or a way to diagnose the issue more completely would be fantastic.p

Negative 19292 pI have a form with two subforms on separate tab pages. Its an MDB project in Access 2003.p  pWhen it initially opens, FormCurrent on the active subform fires once, as it should.p  pBut when you move to another record ie. from the main form, it fires FormCurrent on the active subform 4 times. Then subsequent recordmoves result in FormCurrent firing 2 times. This is a pain, because the subforms have a lot of fields that get moved andor hidden and so it jumps around for every FormCurrent, not to mention being slow.p  pI am opening the form with a filter via DoCmd.OpenForm actually it sends the filter in via OpenArgs. FilterOn is only set once, in FormOpen on the main form, never in the subforms. FormCurrent is not called explicitly anywhere else in the code.p  pWhen I look at the call stack when FormCurrent fires moving the first time, it looks likep  precodemysubform.FormCurrent [ltDebug Windowgt] mysubform.FormCurrent codepre  pSo it seems like something in FormCurrent is triggering another FormCurrent event. But only on the first record move.p  pThe code in FormCurrent is somewhat complex, involving custom classes and event callbacks, but generally does not touch the table data. The only thing I can think might be triggering a FormCurrent is that it checks OldValue on form controls  could this be causing itp  pOr anything else come to mindp  pThanks.p  pEric p

How do I find which DOM element matches a class of chattext and a dataid of 42 Is there any easy method, or do I have to search every .chattext for the one with an id of 42 Or is there another easy way of doing this p  pI did consider the possibility of the container div having the ID, which would make it, I think, slightly easier to get. But if this works, it could be dealing with things in other container divs as well, making that not a longterm solution.p  pEdit Literally seconds after posting this, I found this a hrefhttpjames.padolsey.comjavascriptextendingjquerysselectorcapabilities relnofollowhttpjames.padolsey.comjavascriptextendingjquerysselectorcapabilitiesa which includes information on extending the selector to data. So Ill try that out, and in the meantime, is this a completely foolhardy way of handling thisp

Negative 19292 pAre there any known problems of initialiazing pthread mutexes statically using PTHREADMUTEXINITIALIZER and passing them directly for lockingp  pI read in some sites that this cannot be guaranteed on all platforms and also in the help page the below note is therep  pNote Mutex initialization using the PTHREADMUTEXINITIALIZER does not immediately initialize the mutex. Instead, on first use, the pthreadmutexlock or pthreadmutextrylock functions branch into a slow path and cause the initialization of the mutex. Because a mutex is not just a simple memory object and requires that some resources be allocated by the system, an attempt to call pthreadmutexdestroy or pthreadmutexunlock on a mutex that was statically initialized using PTHREADMUTEXINITIALER and was not yet locked causes an EINVAL error.p  pSo, if two threads call pthreadmutexlock after static initialization, will it lead to any problemp

Negative 19292 pIm implementing a diagram that shows the level of a container. Depending on the fill level, the colour of the line should change for instance, close to the maximum it should show red. Rather than calculating different segments of the line and setting their colours manually, Id like to define a band in which the colour automatically changes. I thought to do this with a custom CompositeCompositeContext, but I seem not to be able to work out the locations of the pixels returned by the raster. My idea is to check for their yValues and change the colour if a colour value is defined in the source and if the yValue exceeds a threshold value.p  pMy CompositeContext looks like thisp  precodeCompositeContext context  new CompositeContext       Override     public void composeRaster src, Raster dstIn, WritableRaster dstOut          int width  Math.minsrc.getWidth, dstIn.getWidth             int height  Math.minsrc.getHeight, dstIn.getHeight              int[] dstPixels  new int[width]              for int y  0 y lt height y             dstIn.getDataElements0, y, width, 1, dstPixels            for int x  0 x lt width x                 if  y  gt 50                dstPixels[x]  1             else                     copy pixels from src                                  dstOut.setDataElements0, y, width, 1, dstPixels      codepre  pp  py seems to be related to something, but it does not contain the absolute yValue in fact the compose method is called several times with 32x32 rasters.

Unfortunately we discovered an issue with your binary that you will need to correct in order for your application to proceed to the review stage. The specific issue is outlined belowp      pInvalid Signature  Make sure you have signed your application with a distribution certificate, not an ad hoc certificate or a development certificate. Verify that the code signing settings in Xcode are correct at the target level which override any values at the project level. Additionally, make sure the bundle you are uploading was built using a Release target in Xcode, not a Simulator target. If you are certain your code signing settings are correct, choose Clean All in Xcode, delete the build directory in the Finder, and rebuild your release target.p      pOnce you have corrected the issue, please return to the applications version details page in the iTunes Connect Manage Your Applications module and click on the Ready to Submit Binary button. This will take you through the binary submission flow and return your application version status to Waiting for Upload. You can then use Application Loader to upload your new binary. If any other issues are found with your submission you will be contacted.p      pThanks,   The iTunes Connect Teamp blockquote  pI have now tried at least 4 times but still the same Anyone know whats happening Thanksp

Negative 19292 pI am wondering over the best architecture for creating a system which helps a user select a Linux system out of a large pool of systems available to them.p  pThis is the use model I seep  ul liPeople want to connect to a Linux server via SSH or VNC and need to know which, out of those available to them, is going to be fastest.li liThere are lots of Linux servers, some better than others more memory, morefaster CPUs, faster NICs, more local storage, etc..li liWe dont want the best servers filling up while the worst stay empty, or a user with a legitimate need for 32GB RAM to be left out because several people who only needed 4GB each filled up all the servers with more than 32GB total RAM.li ul  pHeres a use scenariop  ul liUser needs a system with two idle cores, 100GB free storage, and 16GB free ram.  They enterbr codemagicsystemfinder freemem16GB freestorage100GB idlecores2codebr and expect to wind up connected to an appropriate system via SSH within a few seconds.li ul  pOf course, this is a very basic scenario, but it gives you an idea of the core requirements of the system.p  pFirst, I wonder what projects are already out there and opensource which address similar models.  I want to find an idealized model for handling this and Im sure the issue is general enough that many people have addressed some facet of it.p  pBeyond that, here are some additional concernsp  ul liUsers may need to reserve more resources on a system than theyre actually using presently.  Do you trust them to know how much and for how long  If not, how do you mitigate contentionli liWhen deciding which system is most appropriate for the user, we of course need realtime availability, but also want to consider trends of use both for the system and the user.li ul  pAlso, some vision I have for thisp  ul liBeyond just a CLI, it would be fantastic to have a web interface which allowed you to visually select a server, and which updated in realtime.  I see this as including, e.g., a scatterplot of CPU load and available memory with a point for each system and the ability to drag a bounding box around the set which you want to allow selection from.  Beyond that, histograms of all available metrics with similar draggable selectability.  Being able to tie this into the system so that you could launch a VNC server on the selected system through the web interface would be ideal.li ul  pSo given those considerations, here are some of my architectural questionsp  ol liWhat are all the metrics that might be importantbr How often should they be collectedbr Through what means should they be collected and similarly, distributedli liHow can the system be engineered such that the CLI will always return a host with little delay when scaled to thousands of users and systems  Same for updating the web interface.li liHow can the system be made redundant such that any piece of it failing will not limit functionalityli ol  pI know these questions are very general, but Im posting this to give an overview to anyone who wants to consider the problem in whole.  I will also likely post other questions which focus on a specific aspect and go into more detail about what Ive already considered for it.p  pMany thanks for your considerationp

In this case, you should send the filter definition to server side along with the fetch request of the store. You can do this by modifying the request object every time before store.fetch is called.emp  pAnd it gives some part of example codep  precodevar grid  new dojox.grid.EnhancedGrid   idgrid,   storemystore,   structuremystructure,   plugins     filter        isServerSide true,       setupFilterQuery setupFilter          var setupFilter  functioncommands, request   the commands object here is the same as the POSTed commands object for stateful server, see below.   ifcommands.filter ampamp commands.enable     some filter is defined and valid. You can modify the request object here.   else     no filter is valid.     codepre  pFrom this example , I still dont know how to transfer the filter definition to the sever side. commands.filter is a json object like a tree. How can it be passed to server side through url parameters. Can someone give me some example codesp  pBest Regards ZYp

Negative 19292 pI have a question which is mostly answered by this link a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3148814dragndropfromuipopovercontrollertootheruiviewDragnDrop from UIPopoverController to other UIViewap  pHowever, I have a slight variation of the task.  I want to drag and drop UIImageViews from a UIPopover controller to another UIView, but the number of image views contained in the popover exceeds the iPads height, meaning users must also be able to scroll the popovers content which is presented in a UITableView.p  pIm using a UIPanGestureRecognizer to detect the attempt to drag and drop, but this essentially disables the scrolling by intercepting the event.  I think I know how to handle this.  Scrolling is essentially a vertical move, while dragging and dropping is more of a lateral move.  So, Im thinking that when I detect the beginning of a drag and drop, I have to detect if its primarily a vertical move.  If so, I have to somehow trigger scrolling and pass the motion off to that handler instead.p  pAny a opinions on whether this is the right approach, and b any pointers on the implementationp  pThanks, Waynep

Negative 19292 pI need to optimize an rather big WPF application. We are getting data updates from the domain layer in a very high frequency. One idea to optimize the UI was to delay the update of some UI elements to improve the UI performance. Lets say we have a property Counter in the domain model that changes about 100 times per second. So we could create a timer that fires only once a second and updates an corresponding property in our ViewModel when the timer fires. That works pretty good so far. The timer would just copy the value from the domain object to the view model once a second and were done. p  pProblem is Each view model instance represents an entry in a list. And this list could have several thousand entries. With the solution I described we would also create several thousand timers. I would guess that creating so many timer instances is no good idea. A simple solution would be to just create a static timer instance in a base class or somewhere else and just use this single instance to update all view models. But that is not possible either. We have any different properties that should be updated independently from the domain models and each should have an idividual update rate.p  pQuestion 1 Does anyone have an idea how expensive a timer is Does it really matter if I would create many thousand timersp  pQuestion 2 Another soulution would be to create some sort of scheduler ... a kind of MultiTimer where I can register multiple timeouts. Does anyone have an suggestion on how to implement something like thatp

Negative 19292 pIm using a PHP template engine Ive written some time ago. It relies on regexes to create a cached PHP file. Some examples of the syntaxp  precodefoo  regular variable foo.bar  variable foo that uses the array key bar foouppercase  modifier uppercase that takes foo and applies some method to it  iterationusers     Hi there users.name iteration users codepre  pThe list goes on... Theres quite an amount of nasty regexes involved to parse all this. Note that an iteration can be inside another iteration and so on.p  pRecently Ive been seeing template engines like twig, smarty3, that use a template lexer. I have a few questions about this  In general isnt the lexer way slower than using a few regexes to create a cached php template  Are there good resources on how to write your own lexer to interpret some sort of template language I couldnt find anything I understand on google  Should I keep using regexes or is a lexer something worth exploringp

Negative 19292 pI have an intermittent problem with a telnet based server on Unix the problem crops up on both AIX and Linux. The server opens two sockets, one to a client telnet session, and one to a program running on the same machine as the server. The idea is that the data is passed through the server to and from this program.p  pThe current setup has a loop using select to wait for a read file descriptor to become available, then uses select to wait for a write file descriptor to become available.p  pThen the program reads from the incoming file descriptor, then processes the data before writing to the outgoing descriptor.p  pThe snippet below shows what is going on. The problem is that very occasionally the read fails, with errno being set to ECONNRESET or ETIMEDOUT. Neither of these are codes documented by read, so where are they coming fromp  pThe real question is, how can I either stop this happening, or handle it gracefully Could doing two selects in a row be the problemp  pThe current handling behaviour is to shut down and restart. One point to note is that once this happens it normally happens three or four times, then clears up. The system load doesnt really seem to be that high its a big server. p  precode        if select8, ampreadset, NULL, NULL, NULL lt 0                                  break                          if select8, NULL, ampwriteset, NULL, NULL lt 0                                  break                           if FDISSETSTDINFILENO, ampreadset         ampamp FDISSETfdout, ampwriteset                                  if nread  readSTDINFILENO, buff, BUFFSIZE lt 0                                                   This sometimes fails with errno                              ECONNRESET or ETIMEDOUT                          break                                           codepre

Negative 19292 pI have a system that requires moving an image on the screen. I am currently using a png and just placing it at the desired screen coordinates.p  pBecause of a combination of the screen resolution and the required frame rate, some frames are identical because the image has not yet moved a full pixel. Unfortunately, the resolution of the screen is not negotiable.p  pI have a general understanding of how subpixel rendering works to smooth out edges but I have been unable to find a resource if it exists as to how I can use shading to translate an image by less than a single pixel.p  pIdeally, this would be usable with any image but if it was only possible with a simple shape like a circle or a ring, that would also be acceptable.p

Naturally the virtual directory is not setup on the CI server so the build  package fails.p  pWhat I want to do is use the packaging that msdeploy gives and be able to deploy the site and IIS remotely.  I guess there are a few optionsp  p1 Alter the MVC project file to hard code iis settings so that when ever  where ever you run the build package it creates the XML files with the correct settings so it can be deployed from any machine.  I think this might be able to be done with the package.xml file in the root of the project, but I have no idea how I setup all the app pool and virtual directory settings.  Feel like I am half way there but cant get the final push across the line.p  p2 Use powershell to alter created package XML files so that the extract IIS settings are added.p  pThe first option is preferable as it keeps all the information in one place and you dont need to remember to run an extra script before deployments.p  pI believe I could figure the second option out by using VS to create the package and get the settings I need then script it, but I dont have a clue and spent a fair while reading about it without any success on how I would do option one.p  pN.B.p  pReading some of the suggested questions before I posted this I can see some sort of possibilitiesp  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8256131msdeploydeploysanmvc2applicationwithwrongvirtualdirectorynameMSdeploy deploys an MVC 2 application with wrong virtual directory nameap  pThis question talks about passing extra values on the msdeploy command, seems OK but not internal to the build process so to speak.

Negative 19292 pi stumbled upon a small problem. I designed some elements in my JFrame using netbeans Source view, and now i want to paint some elementsetc. circles. I know its done using the paint method where i do graphics.drawcircle etc., but that overrides the paint method generated by netbeans and none of the elements i styled using source view is now shown. Can it be done so that i can use both Source view and my own paint method or do i need to create everything manually and paint it on my ownp
Negative 19292 pI am working on a .NET MVC C application.  It incorporates jqGrids extensively. p  pI only have one issue. p  pThe application will be used in an Android tablet w ice cream sandwich installed. p  pMy grids have a column with an image use to open the line item page. p  pIf click on this inline open button in any windows based computer or tablet I have no issue on click and it opens. Same for iOS devices. p  pMy problem is that on my Android tablet I am using the Android web browser and the open button in the grid doesnt work most of the time. I have to click several times until it finally works. p  pSame table but with different browser button works ok. p  pI opened the demo jqGrid at the tririand website and the demo for CURD  edit button has an icon similar to mine. When i click there to edit the line there is no issue first time opens up. p  pMy developer says there is the open source and the commercial license for jqGridp  pwould the JS code for editopen button be different because of this license p  pFrom what I understand the main difference is that they supply a working .NET mvc 3.0 demo using jqGrid and also some time of support.p  pBut would the editopen button code be different than the free versionp  pAny suggestions would be more than appreciated.p

Negative 19292 pI would like to replicate google maps map positioning by moving the map to the user position at the opening of the view and at the pushing of the bottom left button. What I tried was to move the region to the position of the user in the mapViewdidUpdateUserLocationuserLocation function. Yet I would like to give the user the possibility to move the map elsewhere and so I put a flag at the beginning of the function to just execute it only the first time the view was opened, otherwise every now and then it fires and frustratingly changes the region back to the user position. Yet, as it comes out the viewWillAppear is not called when returning from background and so the region does not update to the users position even when pressing the manual button that executes [myMapView setRegionregion]. Perhaps I should save the Users position in the not checked part of the didUpdateUserLocation, I do not know. I am really proceeding blindly and I strongly doubt I am the first fellow to face this problem as most map based apps have this feature. I link to a tutorial would be great.p  pThanks,p

Negative 19292 pI am trying to produce a tool which is smart enough to programmtically examine release version binaries produced by identical C code compiled on two seperate machinces at different times and conclude that the code was identical while being able to pick up any code changes if present in the c code used to produce these binaries.p  pI have tried using a number of approaches but in order to keep this short ill just stick to the latest attempt. I run ildasm with the text option on the binaries and replace the GUIDs for anonymous fields etc in text, but when the binaries come from different pcs i find that the text produced by ILDASM text option is reordered. The binaries originating from the same code but compiled by same setup on different machines also appear heavily reordered.

Negative 19292 pExcuse me, I would like to clarify this with you. The ingredients to make a RTMFP connection possible are... you require a Cirrus developer key, a Flash Media Server or FMS hosting, a web server and Flash player 10 or higher. Finally will you need to edit your APIs in Actionscript or Actionscript 3. Is this correct or am i missing somethingp

Negative 19292 pI am new to working with dbs and am hoping this is a fairly common problem.  I have users, clients, and projects.  Users have many clients, clients have many projects, but users can only see SOME of a clients projects.  I have a users table.  I have a clients table with a userid column, thus I can associate clients with a user.  I have a projects table with clientid column, thus I can associate projects with a client.  How can I associate a subset of a clients projects to a particular user.  So clientxyz has projecta, projectb, and projectc. user1 should only see projecta and projectc of clientxyz.  I could add an additional column to the projects table called userid, but this could quickly grow huge if I have 100 users and 100 projects.  How should I set up the db  Am I overcomplicating it  This is Rails 3, I am using Active Record and SQLite.  Thanksp

Negative 19292 pI have a situation where I need to read arbitrarilysized but generally small chunks of binary data from an SQlite database. The database lives on disk, and the data is stored in rows consisting of an id and a readonly blob of between 256 to 64k bytes the length will always be a power of 2. I use the SQlite a hrefhttpwww.sqlite.orgc3refblobopen.html relnofollowincremental IOa to read the chunks into a rewritable buffer, then take the average of the values in the chunk, and cache the result.p  pThe problem I have is that since the chunks are of arbitrary size the blob size will only very occasionally be an integer multiple of the chunk size. This means that a chunk will span two blobs quite frequently.p  pWhat I am looking for is a simple and elegant since elegance is not optional way to handle this slightly awkward scenario. I have a codereadchunkcode function which is fairly dumb, simply reading the chunks and computing averages. So far I have tried the following strategiesp  ul liRead only the first part of an overlapping chunk, discarding the second.li liMake codereadchunkcode aware of blob boundaries, so that it can move to the next blob where appropriate.li liUse something like a ring buffer, so that overlapping chunks can just wrap around the edges.li ul  pThe first option is the simplest but is unsatisfactory because it discards potentially important information. Since codereadchunkcode is called frequently I dont want to overburden it with too much branching logic, so the second option also isnt appealing. Using a ring buffer or something like it seems like an elegant solution. What I envisage is a producer which reads intermediatelysized say, 256 byte chunks from the blob into a 1k buffer, then a consumer which calls codereadchunkcode on the buffer, wrapping around where appropriate. Since I will always be dealing with powers of 2 the producer will always align to the edges of the buffer, and I can also avoid using codemodcode to compute the indices for both producer and consumer.p  pI am using Lisp CL, but since this seems to be a general algorithmic or data structure question I have left it languageagnostic. What I am interested in is in clarifying what options I have  is there another option other than the ones Ive listedp

In fact, instead of searching in p  blockquote   prepositoryplaywar.forge.cloudbees.comreleasecomgithubplay2warplay2warplugin2.9.10.11.2p blockquote  pwhere you can find the right version, sbt search in p  blockquote   prepositoryplaywar.forge.cloudbees.comreleasecomgithubplay2warplay2warplugin2.9.10.11.3p blockquote  pSo I changed the version to 0.7.3 playwarplugin and 0.6 playwarcore linked to my play2 version according to the documentation of playwarplugin githubs documentation. p  pAfter that I try codeplay warcode and I get p  blockquote   p[error] Not a valid command war similar start, runp      p[error] Not a valid project ID warp      p[error] Not a valid configuration warp      p[error] Not a valid key war similar watch, run, targetp      p[error] warp      p[error]    p blockquote  pSo I use codeplay packagecode, it works and makes app1.0Snapshot.war in the target directory. Then I use the cloudbees sdk to run my app p  precodebees appdeploy a myDomaintest t jboss targetapp1.0Snapshot.war bees appupdate myDomaintest disableProxyBufferingtrue codepre  pFinally, I access to my app on test.mydomain.cloudbees.netp  pAnd here the problem, I have got an error p  blockquote   pOops, an error occuredp      pThis exception has been logged with id 6bjlb33p7.p blockquote  pSo I checked my log file on the cloudbees interface but there is no error message. I can see the requests in the Access tab. p  pIs there something that Im missing  How can I make this app works p

Negative 19292 pIm returning codeStreamscode from a remote service code.NET Remotingcode.

However, I would like to know what exactly happens under the cover when I return a codeStreamcode from a remote object.p  pEspeciallyp  ol liShould I better read everything into a codebyte[]code and return that instead of a codeStreamcodeli liOr is .NET remoting doing exactly that for me under the covers anywayli liIf not, how is returning a codeStreamcode different from returning a codebyte[]code In the end, code.NET Remotingcode must somehow serialize the data anywayli liDoes calling codeDisposecode on the client side even has any affect at all Is there any magical connection between the object on the client side and the object on the serverside I think once its deserialized behind the covers, there is no sense in calling codeDisposecode on the client side or is thereli ol  pstrongIm answering to Mike Bild here because I also want to improve the question a littlestrongp  pOk, so the stream talking back to the server is for me at least unexpected.p  pTo cosume a remote object one has to do something like thisp  precodepublic static class ServiceFactory ltTgt         public static T CreateProxy              Type interfaceType  typeofT          string uri  ApplicationServer.ServerURL  interfaceType.FullName          return TActivator.GetObjectinterfaceType, uri       codepre  pSo you are explicitly reaching out for a specific remote object at some URI to consume. And when a method on that remote object returns an object that inherits from MarshallByRefObject that means it automatically is associated with the object on the remote side Ok, that should be easy to reproduce with a test object I build myself. So this also means I should call Dispose on the client side and it gets proxied back to the object on the server sidep

Negative 19292 pHow can I create a Web API controller that generates and returns a compressed zip file streamed from a collection of inmemory JPEG files MemoryStream objects.  Im attempting to use DotNetZip Library.  I found this example a hrefhttpwww.4guysfromrolla.comarticles0929101.aspxpostadlinkhttpwww.4guysfromrolla.comarticles0929101.aspxpostadlinka.  But the Response.OutputStream is not available in Web API and so that technique doesnt quite work.  Therefore I tried saving the zip file to a new MemoryStream but it threw.  Lastly, I tried using PushStreamContent.

Negative 19292 pFirst Im going to demonstrate a poor understanding of the stack, and then Im going to ask a mildly coherent question that cant be answered well because the question isnt specific enough to elicit a wellcomposed answer.p  pSo, when a program runs functions are pushed to the stack  this means the stack pointer is incremented or decrementedp  pWhat exactly is stored in the stack memory allocation Pointers to variable data, pointers to the est of the program I just dont understand what exactly is stored on the stack what data types, what kinds of references, how they ae stored I expect a function stores its local variable pointers and a pointer to the address that called it so it can return.p  pAlso, windows x86 virtual memory allocation actually maps a single block of virtual memory to arbitrary many physical memory addresses, so a stack is or is not contiguous in the physical memory of a windows x86 systemp  pFinally, assuming a stack is stored in the userallocated virtual memory of an application on 32bit windows on x86, the stack pointer which references the high or low memory address is a 31bit 31 because userallocated and the high 2GB are reserved for kernel allocated littleendian reference, rightp  pAnd when data reaches the stack like a function is entered and allocates memory for a new DWORD the data to store in that DWORD is pushed to the stack and the stack pointer is incremented or decremented And how is the system aware of both ends of the stack simultaneouslyp  p ESP HEREp  preference address for variable xp  pinteger data to be stored in the memory address of variable x in function 1p  pfunction 1 block above p  pp  pp  p OR ESP HEREp  pAnd from here the reference address and integer data will be popped into registers, and a mov operation will store the integer data at the allocated memory locationp  pWhen new data hits the stack, Ive heard the stack grows downward but that seems irrational since there are only higher and lower memory addresses  I understand that only one end of the stack needs to be incrementeddecremented, but is it the high or the low address, and how is the stack lengthheight delimited How does the system understand when the stack has grown too largep  pSorry for all the questions, but Ive been doing a lot of reading, and the terminology used to describe the concepts Ive been reading about arent well operationalized in my vocabulary. Also I checked a bit around google, wikipedia, and this site and couldnt find an explanation that addressed my specific concerns.p  pThanks.p

Negative 19292 pA simplified version of what I want is a parent menu with a variable  of child menus. Within my options page, the user can specify how many child menus there ought to be. When this value is changed, I would like the children of the parent menu to update to the correct  specified in the options.p  pThe bulk of my code is within main.js, while the options code is within options.js.p  pOne thought I had was to reload the extension every time the options change this would recall my loop which generates the child menus using the new localStorage value.p  pAnother thought was to have the child menus generated in function call, which removes any existing ones and regenerates them with the updated localStorage value, and then somehow call that function from my options.js.p  pOf course, I dont know how to do either The problem is that the options handling is in options.js, and I need to somehow affect main.js. Im new to java as of today, and I got on pretty well until reaching this roadblock. Ive tried searching for solutions, to no avail no doubt because I was searching for the wrong thing.p  pThe end goal is to allow the user to specify harddrive locations in the options menu, and have those locations accessible via the parent menu.p  pThank you kindlyp

Negative 19292 pRecently, I was looking for information about meteor and derbyjs and did not find too much about except an excellent derbys a hrefhttpwww.slideshare.netstudgeekanoverviewofderbyjsandmeteorjsforthenovanodejsmeetuprefhttpstudgeek.com20120711nodejsmeteorderbyoverviewnodedcpreviewtrueamppreviewid216amppreviewnonce4396a73077articlea that I would like to share with you. Besides all this I have very, very intrigued about both projects. I would choose one of them to test their effectiveness, speed and efficiency, what worries me now is that I want to implement jquery and bootstrap on the client and jade, nib stylus on the server. I want to know which one is faster. From what I read in the a hrefhttpwww.slideshare.netstudgeekanoverviewofderbyjsandmeteorjsforthenovanodejsmeetuprefhttpstudgeek.com20120711nodejsmeteorderbyoverviewnodedcpreviewtrueamppreviewid216amppreviewnonce4396a73077articlea i understand that derby is better, faster, and more compatible with SEO. but I want to know what opinions you have about the two projects.p  pI also read that meteor has a larger community, and have as much investment in the project so they have more support.p  pFor now I just want to know what would be the best choice today.p  pthank you very much everyone, and I hope to get to the creators of the projects so that they can review the implementation of the modules of jade stylus nib, jquery and bootstrap for responsive design.p  pPS I want to leave an important clarification, now my greatest strength is to express nodejs and npm ease allowing me to install any power tool and implement it in my projects.p

Is there a way around this, so I can achieve what I want to do Thank you, Taylorp

Negative 19292 pI am not quite sure what the best or most common practice is when needing HTML elements for your JQuery plugin to work. For example although contrived, if you required a spinner ticker plugin where you would have text box containing a number and to the left of the box a up and down arrow. When the up arrow is clicked the value is incremented and the value is decremented when the down arrow is clicked.p  pI see some JQuery plugins, especially the JQuery UI widgets, that expect you to supply all the html and to give them special classes.p  pIn the case of the spinner would you just expect the input tag and then in the JQuery plugin generate the HTML to render the up and down buttonsp  pPerhaps a better example is something like creating a paging data grid. Would the paging buttons First, Last, Previous, Next, Page 1, Page 2... be generated by the plugin or should the user of the plugin be expected to create HTML with special classes.p

Negative 19292 pI have a very simple AHK script that reads a log.txt every so often and then randomly generates numbers within a range when the triggering text is found then Sends the random number as my guess.  Its for a stupid lottery type thing.p  pThe thing is, if the previous winning number was, for instance, 40, then its seemingly never within 20 numbers of 40 again the next time around, so Im trying to figure out how to locate the number 40 immediately after my Ifinstring trigger, then randomly generate and then Send, a single number between 0 and 20 as well as 60 to 100.  Im sure theres plenty of efficient ways to do this but Im new and would like a simple way.  Its just a macro really, and Im just a newbie trying to optimize my one script.p  pThanks for the patience and help p
Negative 19292 pI have a problem with a Grails based application that is connected to MySQL where there is a process that updates a record as part of a larger transaction. This process also kicks off a 2nd thread via a Quartz job that will perform some additional changes. The Quartz job typically starts before the first thread commits the transaction therefore the job loops up to one minute checking for the record to change to the expected state. Oddly it works consistently in some environments, fails consistently in one and infrequently in yet another.p  pMy question has to do with how MySQL recognizes transaction commits between two concurrent connections. One would expect that when connection A performs the commit, that subsequent queries from connection B would recognize the committed change. In my case connection B will have made the same query one or more times before connection A has made the commit. It appears that mySQL is caching the query results for the connection. Oddly enough, while connection B is repeatedly querying and getting the old value, I can issue the same query via the mysql client and see the new value. Does anyone aware of a caching issue or concurrency issuesp  pFor the above observation I have the MySQL log enabled in order to see the individual update, commits and queries occurring.p  pThe various environments are using different versions of MySQL as shown below. Im in the process of upgrading my environments to the latest MySQL to see if that resolves it.p  p5.0.51a  two environments that have been very stable with infrequent occurrences however one environment started having increased occurrences over the weekend with moderate traffic.p  p5.1.55  one environment consistently failsp  pThanks,p  pJohn p

Negative 19292 pIm trying to combine a hrefhttpwww.highcharts.comstockdemolazyloadinglazy loadinga with a hrefhttpwww.highcharts.comstockdemodynamicupdatedynamically updated dataa in Highstock. The idea is to have a large historical downtotheminute chart with millions of data points which is at the same time updated in real time if the user scrolls to the right edge.p  pTo prevent circular loading while loading data lazily, I need to setp  precodenavigator     adaptToUpdatedData false  codepre  pHowever, with this setting, adding a new data point to the chart does not update the navigator anymore and this prevents me to see those new data points at all because I cant scroll past the previous rightmost entry. Ive tried adding those new data points to the navigator series as well but the navigator still does not get updated. Ive also tried to change the max value in the xAxis of the navigator series programmatically but to no avail.p  pHow can I make this workp
Negative 19292 pIm displaying a GroundOverlay on my map whose image is made with a canvas on which I drew an arc, but Im running into a few problems  first of all, the applications crashes after a little while its giving me a java.lang.OutOfMemoryError, and its not showing the overlay.

80120,21697,21307,21413,21510,21645 with RoleID1 is reporting to Subba Rayudu Yadavalli.Subba Rayadu details are also in the same table. Now i want all the 6 Users details First and then after Subba Rayudu details whose userecode is 20050 and roleid2. Then again we we will take other User details and after that their Supervisor Details and so on till we complete all the RoleID1 Users details and their Immediate Supervisor Details. So the OutPut will contain a series of RoleID1 preceeding with RoleID2 . At last we will display remaining RoleID if exists i.e RoleID3 or 4 or 5 if any exists in sequential manner..p

Negative 19292 pNormally, when I want to access the current Item in Sitecore, I go through codeSitecore.Context.Itemcode. This works well when creating a tool which will be used by the end user, but not for a tool which is consumed by the Sitecore admins. If I want something to show up as a custom field in the codeContent Editorcode itself, the codeContext.Itemcode is a reference to the codeContent Editorcode and not to the node which is selected in the editor.p  pFor the most part I can get around this by using the codeItemIDcode property, but if I have event dispatchers on the field, those will no longer have access to the ItemID.

Negative 19292 p[Im reinventing the wheel , and the question of its shape springs to mind.]p  pFor a a hrefhttpsgithub.combaptistetablegrob relnofollowgraphical display of a tablea, I want to propose a theme that provides easy access to all aesthetic customisations e.g. fill background for the cells, colour of the text, font size, etc.. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comt3BDf.png altenter image description herep  pA list is the obvious choice. However, the complication comes from the fact that the table has an intrinsic structure too it can have a column header, a row header, as well as the core entries. Each of these three blocks should have its own specific aesthetic defaults and requirements, but with a common parent to inherit from. Indeed, I want to be able to specify directly that all the fonts should be black, and unless I specifically overwrite the column header, it will inherit this color too. p  pOne possible construct is the existing framework of function environments closures in R the nested structure is automatically resolved when arguments are evaluated.

Negative 19292 pIm using AJAX to implement a hrefhttpjfarcand.wordpress.com20070515newadventuresincometpollinglongpollingorhttpstreamingwithajaxwhichonetochoose relnofollowlong pollinga on a page which I want to update whenever new rows are inserted into the database. The way this is done is with jQuerys code.ajaxcode calling, for example, codepoll.phpky41code, which queries the database a number of times for rows with an ID of codegt 41code with a small wait in between until a specified timeout. It will fulfil the request immediately if there is a result, or after the given timeout.p  pIn effect, this keeps a hidden connection always open to the server, waiting for it to respond, in order to get notifications.p  pThis works, but Im using DreamHost and after 8 codephp53.cgicode worker processes are spawned, no requests to my site are fulfilled i.e. forever loading until one times out. This affects every other page on my website. The HTTP Server is Apache 2.2.2214.p  pTo alleviate the problem, I have reduced the delays and the timeouts so it is closer to regular polling, and added longer delays when there have been no updates for a while. This means notifications may come a few seconds late, but so far my server has been running fine.p  pWhat Im worried about is how well or rather, how poorly this will scale.p  pMy question is given that Im on a shared host DreamHost, and this page must be compatible with as many browsers as possible except mobile, is there a more efficient way to get instant push notifications from the serverp  pOr, what other options do I have Should I switch back to regular pollingp  h2TL DRh2  pPolling is fast, but longpolling waiting before fulfilling the AJAX request ties up resources. The difference is that longpolling will get the result as soon as it arrives, whereas polling will only pick it up the next time an AJAX request is sent after the new information comes in. Ideally, I would like the advantage of longpolling without tying up threads amp causing other users to wait before pages are served.p

Negative 19292 pI have a weird problem with a buttons Command binding not being updated...p  pI have an app written with MvvmLight, that allows users to maintain a list of medical systems. These systems are built from templates ie a template might specify two cameras, one framegrabber and so on, as well as details about what each of these parts should contain. If the template is modified, the systems can be upgraded to use the new template. Both the system window and the templates window are modeless, so the templates can be modified while a system is being viewed. The templates window view model sends out a message if the template is updated, so that any open system windows can react accordingly.p  pThe system view holds a Border that is used to warn the user when they need to upgrade the system. The Visibility of the Border is bound to a bool property on the system entity that compares the systems revision number with the latest revision number of the underlying template. If they are on the latest template revision, the Visibility is set to Collapsed, so they dont see the contents.p  pIf the system uses an older revision, the Border is visible, and the content contains a message informing them of the need to upgrade, as well as button that does the upgrade. I have three scenarios with this border and button...p  p1 If the system uses an outofdate revision when the window is opened, the border is shown, and the button is visible. If the template is modified, the message updates correctly to show the new number, and the button remains visible. This is correct.p  p2 If the system was using the latest template revision when it was opened, then when the template is revised, the border is displayed correctly, the message is updated correctly, and the button is enabled. Again, this is correct, as long as I close the system window afterwards.p  p3 However, if I click the update button, then after the system is upgraded and the border is hidden, I update the template again, then when the border is redisplayed, the button is disabled. I tried removing all the logic from the CanExecute method and just returning true, so the button should be enabled, but it isnt. I have to close the system window and reopen it to enable the button.p  pI tried adding an event to the view model, which I raised whenever the template was updated. I caught this event in the view and manually refreshed the buttons command binding. However, this did NOT cause the CanExecute method to be called again, and the button remained disabled.p  pI realise that this is all a bit confusing, and hard to debug without seeing the whole thing, but Im hoping someone might be able to give me some clues. In case it helps, here is the relevant code...p  pFirst, the XAML for the border, message and button...p  precodeltBorder VisibilityBinding ConverterStaticResource BoolToVisibilityVC, PathNotUsingLatestDhrTemplate, ConverterParametertrue         HorizontalAlignmentStretch         Margin3         Grid.Row3         BorderBrushRed         BorderThickness2         BackgroundFFFFEBEBgt   ltGrid Margin3         gridHelperGridHelper.GridRows,Autogt     ltWrapPanelgt       ltTextBlock TextThis PCR uses template revision                    VerticalAlignmentCenter gt       ltTextBlock TextBinding TemplateRevisionForThisDhr                   VerticalAlignmentCenter gt       ltTextBlock Text, but the current template revision is                    VerticalAlignmentCenter gt       ltTextBlock TextBinding LatestTemplateRevisionForThisPartDefinitionType                   VerticalAlignmentCenter gt       lttelerikRadButton NameUpdateDhrButton                           ClickUpdateDhrButtonOnClick                           CommandBinding PathDataContext.UpdateDhrCommand, ElementNameDhrViewX                           Margin0,0,10,0                           HorizontalAlignmentRight                           VerticalAlignmentStretch                           IsEnabledChangedUpdateDhrButtonIsEnabledChangedgt         ltStackPanel OrientationHorizontal                     Margin1gt           ltImage Margin0,0,3,0                   Width16                   Height16                   SourceImagescomponentImagesbattery.png gt           ltTextBlockgtUpdate PCRltTextBlockgt         ltStackPanelgt       lttelerikRadButtongt     ltWrapPanelgt   ltGridgt ltBordergt codepre  pThere isnt any point in showing the CanExecute method, as all it contains is return true at the momentp  pIt looks as if there is some odd interaction going on between the visibility of the border and the enabled state of the button, and this seems to be overriding the CanExecute methods result.p  pAnyone any ideas Please feel free to ask if I forgot to add anything important here.

Negative 19292 pMy question is about where I should put a file I need to use in a BULK INSERT command in MS SQL.p  pI have a database running on a server. I run queries on this through an ODBC connection from my machine on the same network. I want to create a stored procedure that will use Bulk Insert to import data from a .txt file and then execute this stored procedure from my machine from clicking a button in  an Excel sheet. p  pIm no expert on how SQL Server actually works to say the least so I have what I imagine is a very basic question for someone who does. Does the .txt file used in the Bulk Insert need to be in a location that can be read by p  pa my machine e.g. on its local hard diskp  por p  pb on a location that can be read by the database server e.g. somewhere on the network that it can accessp  pIm not sure if my local machine or the server is actually opening the file. I would assume its the server, but Id like to be surep  pMany thanks in advance for your helpp

Negative 19292 pI want to add some DOM elements to another extensions XUL file.  p  pThat extension allows itself to be opened by clicking on a toolbar button that it adds to Firefox. Clicking on this button opens a new tab with the chrome address of an XUL file that is part of the extension.  p  pI have already created some DOM elements dynamically and added them to elements on the Firefox window e.g. the previously mentioned toolbar by both adding them when my addon is loaded and using window load event listeners for windows opened after my addon is loaded using codedocument.createElementcode and codeelement.appendChildcode, but I am not sure about the best way to add dynamic elements to this XUL file that can be opened and closed multiple times in the same window.p  pIs there any way to overlay the XUL file one time per session I am guessing not  Otherwise, do I need to set up some kind of page load listener that fires every time a page loads and then checks the address to see if it matches the XUL files address and does the overlay if so  Is it possible to listen for a specific addressp
Negative 19292 pI am forgoing dual booting for the ease of a virtual machine and I have a few questions which I am unable to find answers to online.

If I run code in the VM using MPIpthreadsopenMP, will I be able to utilize the 4 physical cores How about the hyperthreading 8 cores  Will there be a slow down of the 2.4 GHz I assume there will be some since they need to also run Windows, but how horribly will it be affectedp  p2 I have a dedicated GPU GeForce GTX 770M, will I be able to use the dedicated GPU for CUDA based or OpenCL, or any kind of GPGPU programmingp  p3 I am starting out with 4 GB or RAM, but plan on upgrading to 16 GB. I know that the RAM will affect the VM, but will it be the dominate thing which affects VM performance Once I upgrade to the full 16 GB of RAM, will I be able to consider any other inefficiencies to be negligiblep  pThanks for the help ahead of time. Again, even pointing me in the right direction for reading will help if full answers cannot be given.p

Negative 19292 pI have question to solve linear system using armadillo. Axb. But my A matrix is pretty big. It is armacxmat A40000,40000. When I run xarmasolveA,b, armadillo will try to allocate a new memory to store A, and then use the new memory to do LU decomposition and will not use the memory that store the original A. The definition of solve can be found in fnsolve.hpp. But you already see my A is pretty big. Allocate a new memory will consume all the memory quickly. For my problem, I do not need the original A any more. So can I use some method to let armadillo to use the original memory for A to do LU decompositionp  pThank you very muchp

Negative 19292 pI hate to ask a question like this, because I feel like I should really figure out the solution on my own, but I really am at a loss for what exactly is wrong with this code. I hope that a fresh set of eyes on it will reveal some flaw in something that Ive taken for granted as functioning. p  pThe goal of this program is to perform a graph search in order to solve a classic riddle. It starts with a parent node of all four bools set to false, and the goal is to get them all set to true. This is done by finding all valid children for the node based on a validation function and putting them into a tree list of nodes. The parent is also put into an explored list of nodes. p  pWhen looking for the next child to use, a loop looks in the tree list and finds the value with the lowest cost, while ignoring any nodes that are already in the explored list. Upon finding the next node with the lowest cost, it returns it as the new parent, and the loop begins once more. Once the goal node is reached, the loop exits, the path to the goal node is constructed, and printed in a special formatting. p  pThats all thats supposed to happen, but when I run the program, it simply goes on infinitely. Based on some debugging, I believe that theres a problem with my loop to find a new parent node. The first parent works fine, it is valid parent and gets the first batch of child nodes created and added to the tree list. Once the second is picked which based on my calculations and confirmed by printing tests is an invalid node, the progress goes as followsp  ol lipno new children are found this is intended functionality for an invalid parent nodepli lipthe parent is not added to the tree list because it is already there again, intended functionalitypli lipthe parent is added to the explored list because it was not yet found there intended functionality, all good so farpli lipthe loop for choosing the next parent appears, heres where things go wrongpli ol  pAs far as I can tell, the loop to select a new parent just continually selects that same second parent over and over again. I have debugged with printing tests to find that the entire while loop just goes forever picking and rejecting that exact same node, even when it shouldnt pick it more than once since it was added to explored list.p  pIs there something wrong with my list that Im not seeing Heres the code for reference.

Negative 19292 pIm currently trying to ensure that our legacy backend can support resolving date times based on the users current time zone or, more specifically offset.  Our servers are in eastern standard time, and most of our date times originate there.  However, for users that are in other time zones, a conversion to their time zone or, in this case, offset is needed when retrieving those date times.  Also, date times coming from the user will have to be converted to eastern standard time before persistence on the server.  Given that the front end we are developing is webbased, I am able to retrieve the users offset in minutes and pass that value into my service layer within the header.  I looked at Noda Time and think its a great API.  It did force me to think about time in a more refined matter, but I am still not 100 sure that Ive properly used it correctly.  Here are the methods that I wrote for the conversions described above.  Ive tested them and they seem to work.

Negative 19292 pIm writing an API and website which displays charts of data.  Ive written an abstracted Chart object, which has things like a Series collection, various display options, and other stuff youd expect to find on a Chart object.  p  pIm using this abstracted Chart object to allow users of my API to create a chart which the API can format into numerous different outputs.  For example, it can use MSCharts to create a chart image, then populate it with the appropriate settings from my own abstracted chart object.p  pIm also trying to get it so that my website portion of this project can output a nice dynamic JavaScript chart using jqPlot.  My initial plan was to have an MVC Partial view which took my Chart object as a model, and translated this into JavaScript.  This became an awful pain to format, jumping into Razor code to make decisions, dropping out to output JavaScript and so on.  p  precode.jqplotchart, data,      if chart.Animate  lttextgtanimate true,lttextgt      if chart.Animate  lttextgtanimateReplot true,lttextgt      title Model.Title,                 ... codepre  pThis is relatively basic, but when you get as far as spitting out series formatting information, it becomes unreasonably complex and not something I want to maintain.p  pMy next plan was that an MVC action could just output the entire chart object using codereturn Json...codep  pThat works quite nicely to a point C codep  precodechart  new    animate  abstractedChart.Animate,   animateReplot  abstractedChart.Animate,   title  v.Title,   axes  new              xaxis  new             codepre  p...p  pBut it falls over when you get to formatting the series.  jqPlot wants me to do something like thisp  precodeseries [     renderer .jqplot.LineRenderer .... codepre  pI cant think of a way of outputting a reference to a JavaScript object from MVC in this way.p  pAt this point, Im starting to think I might need to write something to spit out raw JavaScript, and just shove that in my Partial View using codeHtml.Rawcode but, I keep thinking there must be a better way.p  pSo thats my question  is there a better wayp

Negative 19292 pWe have a fairly elaborate data model built from an existing database, then enhanced using partial classes to support additional methods amp properties, inheritance, etc.  We have not yet bitten the bullet to update this from ObjectContext to DbContext.p  pI am using VS2012, .net 4.5, EF 6.0.2, and have installed the EF 6.0.2 Tools for VS2012.p  pFollowing the recommended mechanism to update a project to EF6 a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenusdatadn469466httpmsdn.microsoft.comenusdatadn469466a has been successful, including the addition of the EF 6 Entity Object generator as the code generation item.p  pSubsequent to making this change, I would like to update the model from the database to incorporate some recent schema changes into the model.

Negative 19292 pI have a database which I consider to be my application and a website acting as a user interface for that application.  It is now time to add more user interfaces to my application phone apps etc.p  pKeeping this in mind, I have come up with a web service architecture to feed data to all my user interfaces.  I would like to sanity check this with the brains on stack overflow.  Btw  this is all Azure hosted.p  ol liDatabase, as is.li liCore web service  this handles all important methods and invokes the main processes on the DB.  For example, registration.  This will also automatically queue emails to be sent, etc.li liWeb Services for each UI website, phone app  these are specific methods for the UI data calls  e.g. GetDataForRegistrationPage  specific to the website and not needed for the app.  The app would have different requirements.li ol  pSo far I think this is reasonable though Im interested in your opinions.  I would like a bit of help with the next bit how they communicate.p  pI would like the Core web service to be a WCF Service that can ONLY be accessed on named pipe endpoints  ensuring that only the client web services can communicate with them I can guarantee they are on the same machine. I would like the Client Web Services to bind to their applications by TCP or http.  The website will be on a separate machine but on the same network and so is a good contender for TCP.  The apps will of course be on clients and would be best as http I believe.p  pI am worried that Ive introduced too many steps with this design.  Using registration as an example, the user would register using the website page which goes to the web server which would invoke the registration method on the website web service, which would invoke the registration method on the core web service, which would invoke registration on the database.p  pThank you for your thoughtsp  hr  pI posted the below as answer but got told off.  If we really want to be anal about this then I guess no one should have posted anything as answer as there is no real answer  I was asking for opinions, but anyway...p  pJust in case it is of any interest to others having similar design questions. I have decided to get rid of the core service idea and just use a class library shared between each client service.p  pPros Easier to develop, one less complication setting up named pipes seems impossible to me and one less process to get involved even if it is on the same machine.p  pCons Each service now HAS to be on Azure, otherwise it cannot access the Azure storage facilities. I will be using the queue to schedule emails. With the first approach I could have potentially hosted one service on a completely separate platform.p  pFeel free to comment with any ideas or observations. Thank you for the input, Ramiramilu and Markus.p
Negative 19292 pPerhaps this is too broad a question, but I still want to hear what are the best practices and what is considered correct. I did not find a similar topic, probably due to how generic it is and thus hard to search.p  pThis all began when we took a windows service project and added another service to it. Previously, the main method was what we considered the emComposition Rootem, and our IoC container registration code, app.config reading and similar was in the main method in one form or another. After assembling required dependencies there we created the service by calling codeResolvecode on the container and running it.p  pWhen we created another class inheriting from codeServiceBasecode we noticed that it did not make sense to have the main as the composition root anymore, because the multiple services are potentially completely different and thus require different initialization code. p  pThe only enlightening post I found on the mather was a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma68279811946412this one from Mark Seemanna, where he states that the codeOnStartcode would be the aggregate root in that particular case.p  pIn general, what is the best approach to take when choosing and appropriate composition root Should I consider this windows service scenario an outlier and just code differently for it while leaving the main method as other project types composition roots, or is there a more general approach that would be valid in all contextsp  pPerhaps the fact that the services require very different setups is an indicator that they should be separated in multiple standalone projects, where the main would be again used as the composition rootp  pWe generally use .Net but this probably applies to many other programming languages as well.p

Negative 19292 pI am trying to enable scrolling on a picturebox.  I have everything working except for one nagging little detail.  The focus shifts in an inexplicable way to the wrong scroll bar with the first click of the arrow key.  The picture box has two scrollbars which become visible when the picture being displayed is too large.  If the picture fits inside the box no scrollbars show and the vertical arrow keys behave the same as page updown keys.p  pOn the mousedown event over the picture box I set the focus to the picture box object so the user can scroll with the mouse wheel.  The user can then move the image one of three ways.  They can click and hold and drag it updownrightleft, or they can scroll with the mouse wheel vertically or they can use the arrow keys to scroll in all four direction.  If they use the arrow keys I check PreviewKeyDownEvent on the scroll bars for which key and if it is an updown or rightleft arrow key I set the focus on either the horizontal or vertical scroll bar.p  pThe problem is I see this in the debugger that when the down key is pressed as an example the PreviewKeyDownEvent handler runs and sets the focus verticalBar.Focus in this case I see the focus shift to the vertical scroll bar, but as soon as the scope leaves the event handler it shifts to the opposite scroll bar horizontal in this casep  pI am writing a form into a third party application so I could see focus going to some default control being caused by some outside function.  The odd thing is that it always goes to the opposite scroll bar from what I just set vertical if I want horizontal and horizontal if I want vertical.  Once the focus is on either scroll bar a second click on the an arrow key will shift the focus to the correct scroll bar and things will then work appropriately after that.p  pIf the focus is already ON one scroll bar or the other it will work as expected.  Focus will shift back and forth between them appropriately.  But if focus starts on the picture box it will always be set to the wrong bar on the first click.p  pI am new to C and GUI stuff in general so any advice will be much appreciated.  p  pthanksp

Negative 19292 pApologies up front as I somehow feel this question is trivial, but I cant seem to get my head around it and the answers I found online seem to be only concerned with setting and resetting single bits.p  pI have a 32bit number that I am using to store several fields of information.  The way this is done is to define various offsets and masks, e.g. p  precodeuint32t          key static const uint16t offset   10  example field, key uses all 32 bits static const uint16t mask     0x1FF codepre  psetting is done in a method as in p  precodevoid setField unsigned int rhs   key   rhs ltlt offset    codepre  por extracted p  precodeunsigned int getField  return  key gtgt offset  amp mask  codepre  pAll of this is fine, provided that I never need to set a new value in the field in question. If I do set a new value, I need to first erase all the bits for this field and only those, since of coursep  precodekey   10 ltlt offset  followed by key   16 ltlt offset  key gtgt offset amp mask   26 and not 16 codepre  pNow, what I am looking for is a way to first reset the field in the setter method so as to assure that only the last value will be taken, but the only thing that I could come up with is something like p  precodekey   key gtgt offset amp mask  ltlt offset codepre  pso get the current value from the key and XOR it with the complete key so as to set all those bits to zero. Now, this works, but seems convoluted for such a seemingly simple task.p  pAny hints on how this can be done more efficiently or elegantly would be gladly appreciated. p

Oddly enough, the error seems not to occur when ran for the first time.p  pI have spend a lot of time in figuring out what causes the problem and how to solve it, but I have only been able to strongly reduce my problem to the code provided below. The MAKESTUB parameter allows to use piped streams instead of socket streams. It often leads to an error caused when the thread is closed before the client has finished reading, but sometimes the same error as when using sockets also occurs, which presumably indicates that the problem is not caused by misuse of sockets, but rather misuse of streamsp  pI have furthermore tried the following things changing when the output is flushed, adding  n in println, sendingreceiving in turn PINGPONG, preventing the streams from being garbage collected using a static list, sending a string instead of the JSON, etc. What I find curious is that these solutions only cause the block to occur earlier or later.p  pClient codep  precodeimport java.io.BufferedReader import java.io.IOException import java.io.InputStream import java.io.InputStreamReader import java.io.OutputStream import

Ideally what Id like to have happen is to be able to get this thing into a SSIS data flow so I can dump it into a table in my SQL database. The funky stuff comes in with the additional nested rows, these are items nested within other items, and Id like to retain the nesting information. Ideally what Id like to do is have a new column created that includes the itemID of the parent item, and would be 0 or null if its at the top level. This would also require duplicating the locationID of the parent item.p  pErgo, the final output would be a table with the following rows itemID, locationID, typeID, quantity, flag, singleton, parentID.

Negative 19292 pI have completed the Discover Meteor application and I have a question related to the behindthescene performance of loading a package. To be more precise, the tutorial makes the user first creating the error handling functionalities inside the main meteor project and then makes the code modular creating an emerror packageem. p  pBeside the obvious advantage of having a package, is there a specific why one should create a package instead of simply having the same in the project Any performance difference, any advantage on the way packages are loaded Any disadvantage I should be aware ofp  pI can boil down the question in, does a package have better performances compared to the same code in the main project folderp

Negative 19292 pI have some large series of datasets.

If the table does not exist, it creates the table, and also inserts 2014 in tblYears to keep track of the tables that have been created.p  pMy issue Im trying to allow the user to be able to lookup date ranges of the data. So Maybe someone wants to see Data spanning across February 2013 to March 2015.p  pSo Im sure I can find a SQL query with a WHERE clause to lookup only the data within the Date Range the user gives, however my issue arises if the date range spans across multiple years.

Negative 19292 pI have read a lot about how we cannot override or disable home button. And I too agree that its risky in many ways as some people might take wrong advantage of it. But unfortunately its a requirement in my app.p  pI was able to hide them in my device which runs on Android Kitkat using the codeImmersivecode feature. Its true that when user swipes from the edge of the screen it makes the status and navigation bar visible. But I found out a way to disappear it again by calling codeImmersivecode every second or so using codeCountDownTimercode. The result was satisfactory and got the job done.p  pBut I do not have any solution for Android devices which does not run on Kitkat as the bars appear every time we interact with screen. Even though the bars hide but appearing every time the user touches the screen does not look good. So codeImmersivecode feature is out of question since it does not run except for Kitkat.p  pstrongI did try out another solution suggested in various SO postsstrong p  pMaking my activity visible when the screen is locked. This helped me to get rid of the third button button right side of Home button, not sure what it is called. And we could easily handle back button. But still home button is remaining. I need to somehow make this Home button disable or do nothing. Or atleast worst case scenario navigate to my app when ever I click on home button Is it possiblep  pWhat I am looking for is the user should only be able to leave the app from a button which I have provided in my app, there shouldnt be any other way.

Negative 19292 pUnfortunatly I am unable to provide code to this site due to where I work. With that said I will be as detailed as I can. I am working on using aan XML file to populate a JcomboBox based of the Name element. I have that part working. The way I am doing this is by using DOM method and I create in Object for each of the Nodes and then I uset set methods to grab the attributes that I require.p  pWhere I am now is I need to populate a text field based off of what was selected. I am struggling to figure out how to associate what is selected to what I need. For instance let say I have a node called ReferencePointID and I needed to pull the child node called Latitude to populate the JTextField. How would I associate the child node with the parent node to pull the correct datap  pAgain I am sorry I cannout provide the code but any help will be much appreciated. Thank you.p
Negative 19292 pFirst Id like to thank you all for your time and help, in advanced. My question is probably a basic, and silly one. However, I am a beginner and I guess this is a good place to learn p  pSo, I have a custom object called Question, and it is described in Question.java It looks like thisp  precodeimport android.os.Parcel import android.os.Parcelable      public class Question implements Parcelable     String mark     String total     String worth  public QuestionString amark, String atotal, String aworth       mark  amark     total  atotal     worth  aworth    public QuestionParcel in           mark  in .readString         total  in .readString         worth  in .readString     Override public int describeContents       TODO Autogenerated method stub     return 0  private void readFromParcelParcel in        mark  in .readString     total  in .readString     worth  in .readString    Override public void writeToParcelParcel dest, int flags       TODO Autogenerated method stub     dest.writeStringmark     dest.writeStringtotal     dest.writeStringworth    public static final Parcelable.CreatorltQuestiongt CREATOR  new Parcelable.CreatorltQuestiongt      public Question createFromParcelParcel in          return new Questionin           public Question[] newArrayint size          return new Question[size]        codepre  pNow I am creating a user defined number of forms to collect information from a user. So I am trying to create a SparseArray, which each entry contains a Question object so I can pass all this information to another activity for implementation. Now I have all the passing working, as it seems. However, because each time my UserFragment.java is opened each form is an instance of UserFragment, controlled by FirstFragment.java which is the activity creating the view pages, basically I create a new SparseList of question because my UserFragment.java looks like this p  precodeimport android.content.Intent import android.os.Bundle import android.support.v4.app.Fragment import android.support.v4.view.ViewPager import android.util.SparseArray import android.view.LayoutInflater import android.view.View import android.view.View.OnClickListener import android.view.ViewGroup import android.widget.Button import android.widget.EditText import android.widget.TextView import android.widget.Toast  public class UserFragment extends Fragment        public View onCreateViewLayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container,             Bundle savedInstanceState          final View rootView  inflater.inflateR.layout.layoutavgcalcform,                 container, false          final int pagetotal  getArguments.getIntsize              TextView tv  TextView rootView.findViewByIdR.id.avgtesttv            tv.setTextString.valueOfgetArguments.getIntpageposition          String Text          ifpagetotalgetArguments.getIntpageposition              Text  Submit           else          Text  next            Button b  Button rootView.findViewByIdR.id.button1         b.setTextText         b.setOnClickListener new View.OnClickListener                 public void onClickView v                    Extracting the information from the user input forms NOTENEED TO ADD ERROR CHECKING                 final EditText markc  EditTextrootView.findViewByIdR.id.editTextASSMARK                 final EditText marktotc  EditTextrootView.findViewByIdR.id.editTextASSTOT                 final EditText assvalc  EditTextrootView.findViewByIdR.id.editTextASSWORTH                    Converting from INFO string to int                    double currentassmark  Double.parseDoublemarkc.getText.toString                    double currentassworth  Double.parseDoublemarktotc.getText.toString                    double currentassval  Double.parseDoubleassvalc.getText.toString                     Determining the current viewnumber or form number the user is currently on.                    int currentviewnum   FirstFragment getActivity.getPager.getCurrentItem                     saveDatanew Questionmarkc.getText.toString,marktotc.getText.toString,assvalc.getText.toString,currentviewnum                    FirstFragment getActivity.getPager.setCurrentItemcurrentviewnum1                    double totalpercentage doublecurrentassmarkcurrentassworthcurrentassval                    Bundle bundle  new Bundle                    int currentpagenumber   getArguments.getIntpageposition                    String currentpage  String.valueOfcurrentpagenumber                    bundle.putDoublecurrentpage, totalpercentage                      ifpagetotalcurrentpagenumber                        bundle.putStringTEST, currentpage                        Intent intent  new IntentUserFragment.this.getActivity, DisplayAverageActivity.class                                          bundle.putIntnumberofforms, getArguments.getIntpageposition                         bundle.putSparseParcelableArrayQuestions,questions                        intent.putExtrasbundle                        startActivityintent                                                     return rootView       this is an error, on every creation of UserFragment, it basically creates a new questions array.

So basically when I try to access this, of course the, only iteration that does not give me a null pointer is the last. When I access it like this for example String markk  questions.gettotalasses1.mark only totalasses1 works. So I would really appreciate it, if anybody could assist me on a solution to my problem, how do I define the array, in lets say FirstFragment.java or somewhere external to UserFragment so that it only creates the SparseArray once, and then just fills each entry with the Question form from the corresponding view pager formp  pIf you could, please include some coded examples, and some explanation as I am a beginner, and I do want to learn, as well as finding a solution p  pThank you very much.    p

Negative 19292 pMy question is about whether the boost regex engine can do global searches.br Ive tried and I cant get it to do it.  p  pThe matchresults class contains the base pointer of the string, so after incrementing thebr starting position manually then setting the codematchflagtypecode to codematchnotbob  matchprevavailcode,br I would have thought the boost regex engine would be able to know it is in the middle of a string.  p  pSince Im using this engine in my software, Id like to know if this engine can infact do this correctly and Im doing something wrong, or global searching is not possible with this engine.  p  pBelow are sample codeoutput using BOOST regex, and an equivalent Perl script.p  pemEditem Just to clarify, in the below boost example the codeStartcode iterator is always treated as a boundry.

Negative 19292 pstrikeIs there a better way to make writing to files thread safe for cases where the file may not be all the same in every thread than synchronizing the method or the file writer I read a few threads similar to this topic, but they seem to focus on one file as opposed to multiple files.p  pEx. There are 20 threads that writes meaning it uses a method that creates a a file writer to the file and then writes to it with a trycatch, etc to file 10 of the threads write to fileA, 5 threads write to fileB, 4 threads write to fileC, and 1 thread writes to fileD.p  pSynchronizing the method would not be efficient since threads that want to write to different files will have to wait for the previous thread to finish before it can proceed. I think synchronizing the file writer does pretty much the same or am I wrongstrikep  pIf I were to have a separate thread thread from the main application that writes to a file, would they execute run in the order they were submitted to the ExecutorService with 1 threadp  pIn the main application, I would submit new threads to the ExecutorService uses 1 thread. The threads would write to a file using a write method that has the FileWriter synchronized from a Logger class. The threads would write to the file one by one because the FileWriter is syncrhonized and there is only 1 threads for the ExecutorService, which will prevent multiple writes to the same file at once. The question is will the threads write to the file in the order they were submitted to the ExecutorService I know they start in the order they were submitted, but I am not too sure on the execution order.p

Negative 19292 pA question was asked to me during an online interview. They provided a piece of code and we have to find out a possible bug in the code. The code is provided below as it is.p  ol liThe function is provided with a non empty zero indexed vector of integers which contains only 1 and 0.li liThe function will return the start position of longest sequence of 1s. for example if the input values code0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1code it will return code3code because the longest sequence of 1s is from position 3 to 7 total five consecutive 1s. if the input values are code0,0,1code then it will return code2code because there is only one 1 and length of longest sequence of 1 is one.li liIf there are no 1s then it will return code1code.li liThe input vector can be changed so we cant change the signature of the vector to const.li ol  pI tested this function with variable no of inputs and I found out that it is working fine.

Negative 19292 pI am a beginner programmer making a game for the AppStore on Xcodes sprite kit. The game takes place on a background wider than the screen the height of the map is equal to the height of the screen but the width of my map is much larger than that of the screen, and I want the user to view the other parts of the map by swiping. Up until now I have used the touchesbegin,touchesmoved and touchesend methods to reposition the background map, but I wanted to give a shot at using UISwipeGestureRecognizer. I have just implemented the basics of this, but when I use something as followsp  precode voidhandleSwipeUISwipeGestureRecognizer swipe ... CGPoint touchLocation  [swipe locationInViewswipe.view]  touchLocation  [self convertPointFromViewtouchLocation] NSLogPoint A is f,f, touchLocation.x,touchLocation.y ... codepre  pit will only take in the initial point where I began the swipe and regardless where I add a CGPoint touchLocationEnd in this method, it gives me the same position the initial point. p  pWhat I would like to accomplish is to have the background map move as I move my pointer from one location to a second location that is, for the point on the background map that I first click be dragged to a new position on the viewable screen. How can I accomplish this using UISwipeGestureRecgonizer  Ill be happy to go more in depth if this isnt clearp

Negative 19292 pThis is an open question. I am trying to write HTML pages for defining  editing strongemquestionsemstrong database objects. A strongemquestionemstrong is composed of a small text and a type the type indicates its strongdeclinationstrong. The question declinations are, for example, emsliderem, emyesnoem, emfreetextem or emmultiple choiceem. For the emfreetextem and emyesnoem declinations, no further information is needed. But for the emsliderem and emmultiple choiceem ones, additionnal information have to be entered.p  pNow what I done  tried is create emform, view and templateem to define a generic question, and create strongemsubemstrong emforms, views and templatesem for each question declination that needs additionnal fields.p  pThe problem is that I encounter difficulties to keep the generic strongquestion idstrong in the sub forms to attach the additionnal fields to the question. I tried to pass it to the sub view, but I must have access to it in the form too to save the database object with the question reference, so it means adding a hidden input field in the form, which leads to other issues, etc etc...p  pWhat I lack is webdevelopment experience... The better thing I could get is dynamic dropdown menus adapting to the selected strongquestion typestrong, but I do not know javascript or ajax language for now, so a few different viewstemplates would be enough.p  pWhat would be the easiest  best way to achieve this  I am not asking for code but rather something like a methodology.p  pPlease let me know if I missed something that makes the question incomprehensible.p

Negative 19292 pMy question is pretty straightforward. I need to display a print preview dialog in a multiuser ERP environment. It speaks for itself that printing should be as fast as possible. However, if I use the code below, it takes about 10 seconds before the preview is displayed and is fully generated. This is without database access or any other CPU intensive operations.p  pIs there any way or method to improve this performance Im also able to use WPF, should that be necessary.p  pIve noticed that if you generate the preview, close it, and then quickly generate it again, it responds much faster, about a second or two. If you then wait another 5 seconds or so, generate it again, it takes about 10 seconds again.  Im guessing some type of caching is going on, but dont have a clue whats actually happening.p  precodeusing System using System.Collections.Generic using System.Drawing using System.Drawing.Printing using System.Linq using System.Text using System.Threading.Tasks using System.Windows.Forms  namespace PrintPerformanceTests      public class PrintPreviewTest              private string printerName         private PrintPreviewDialog printPreviewDialog1         private PrintDocument printDocument1  new PrintDocument         private Random random  new Random          public string PrinterName                      get  return printerName              set  printerName  value                    public PrintPreviewDialog PrintPreviewDialog                      get  return printPreviewDialog1              set  printPreviewDialog1  value                    public PrintPreviewTeststring printerName, PrintPreviewDialog printPreviewDialog                      this.PrinterName  printerName             this.PrintPreviewDialog  printPreviewDialog             printDocument1.PrintPage  new PrintPageEventHandlerprintDocument1PrintPage                   public void GenerateRandomPrintPreview                      Cursor.Current  Cursors.WaitCursor             try                              PrintPreviewDialog.Document  printDocument1                 PrintPreviewDialog.ShowDialog                          catch Exception exc                              Cursor.Current  Cursors.Default                 MessageBox.Showexc.ToString                          finally                              Cursor.Current  Cursors.Default                                void printDocument1PrintPageobject sender, PrintPageEventArgs e                      e.Graphics.PageUnit  GraphicsUnit.Millimeter             usingFont f  new FontArial, 10f                              for int i  0 i lt 20 i                                      string txt  Random string   i.ToString                     e.Graphics.DrawStringtxt, f, Brushes.Black, new PointFrandom.Next10, 200, random.Next10,280                                            e.HasMorePages  false                codepre  pusagep  precode        PrintPreviewTest pt  new PrintPreviewTesttbPrinter.Text, printPreviewDialog         pt.GenerateRandomPrintPreview codepre

Negative 19292 pIm using C and have a simple client .exe that when handed a file name, it does process it and return success or error code. I want to create a Windows C .exe that does the following and was looking for sample code to do itp  ul liStart 4 or x client .exe as separate process for ex. using CreateProcessli liWhile the list of the files is not empty Send work to clients Each client will process a sent file name and return either successbr or error codeli liOnce the list of files to process is empty or the producer .exe shutdown close thebr 4 clients so they shutdown.li ul  pI did some research on this and found that pipes can be used to communicate between process. I found this sample app that does a communication between a server and client in c a hrefhttpscode.msdn.microsoft.comwindowsappsCppNamedPipeServerd1778534 relnofollowhttpscode.msdn.microsoft.comwindowsappsCppNamedPipeServerd1778534ap  pThe sample app does however sends request from client to server and get a response and I wanted to modify it or use a different sample app to do batch processing through having a common queue of work or pipe that store this queue or batch of work and send work to clients. I want to synchronize this work so as soon as client is done with one file, Ill send it another file to process.p  pBasically I want to create a sample application .exe that start multiple clients and send them work through interprocess communication. Any sample C code to do this is appreciated.p  pThanksp  pJeff Lacostep

Then I have a separate object filled with questions.p  pCould I set a random number on the Questions object to randomly generate a question then have some logic that knows when that question is generated, only these certain key value pairings from my objects can fit as answers p  pE.g. if the question is, Which one of these is a Manchester United defender It would pull a random one Manchester United defender and randomly fill up the remaining three options with defenders from other teams.p  pEvery time I try to write it out logically, I get muddled so I think Im approaching this poorly.p  pThanks and sorry for the rookie questionsp

Negative 19292 pI am trying to figure out a way to use a NSPredicate I think this is the tool I need to use to use CloudKit to query for the most recent CKRecord of a certain record type.p  pBecause it is only the most recent one, I dont need all of the CKRecords returned to me, nor do I want to set a limited span of time as this app may have a bunch of people using it at times, and probably will eventually have close to zero people using it. The closest post I could find towards my question involved getting CKRecords between two dates a few minutes ago, and when the Query was started. p  pThis way, if a person were to get the most recent record and it was 2 months old, or it was 2 seconds old, this query would work.p  pAnyone know how to do this Ive got the code working for using a predicate that finds all records, so just this part needs fixing.

Negative 19292 pI do not know how to handle my issue here and I am looking for the most practical solution. I have to track a userid across multiple tables and I am looking at triggers and Foreign Keys to solve the initial inserts into the databases for each user.

That way its always an update statement when I reference it in the code. p  pHere is my Table Structurep  precode        CREATE TABLE authentication            userid int11 unsigned NOT NULL AUTOINCREMENT,           fname varchar11 COLLATE utf8unicodeci DEFAULT NULL,           lname varchar11 COLLATE utf8unicodeci DEFAULT NULL,           email varchar50 COLLATE utf8unicodeci NOT NULL DEFAULT ,           password varchar11 COLLATE utf8unicodeci DEFAULT NULL,           online int11 DEFAULT NULL,           createdat varchar11 COLLATE utf8unicodeci DEFAULT NULL,           PRIMARY KEY email,           KEY userid userid          ENGINEMyISAM AUTOINCREMENT5 DEFAULT CHARSETutf8 COLLATEutf8unicodeci           CREATE TABLE userprogress            userid int10 NOT NULL,           progressevent varchar25 COLLATE utf8unicodeci DEFAULT NULL,           PRIMARY KEY userid          ENGINEMyISAM DEFAULT CHARSETutf8 COLLATEutf8unicodeci codepre  pHere is an example trigger I tried to makep  precode        CREATE TRIGGER userprogressadd         AFTER INSERT ON authentication         FOR EACH ROW         BEGIN           INSERT INTO userprogress userid, progressstatus           VALUES NEW.userid, signup         END codepre  pThis trigger did not work.

Negative 19292 pWe have a codeTextcode widget whose input is changed dynamically. The size is computed after setting a new input. The size should always be as small as possiblep  pThis works all fine. I was just wondering if it is in any way possible to restrict the size of this codeTextcode. If a lot of lines are added to the text, it takes up all of the composite. Is there any way to update the size of the codeTextcode widget after changing the text, but only up to a certain maximum valuep  pSo far, I tried to add a resize listener on the codeTextcode. The problem is though, that the widget is resized, but the space is taken from the buttom. So the other content above is covered anyways.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comMpbrD.png altenter image description herep

Negative 19292 pHappy New Year to all...p  pForgive me, I know there have been many similar questions asked and a lot of discussion on this topic.  However I have searched high and low for hours without getting the answer I need.  Ive had to admit defeat and ask for a little help.  I am relatively new to all this but Ill endeavour to provide all the required information... p  pI am using the Dynamic Drive ddsmoothmenu on my website www.stepaheadtravel.com and the navigation works fine in a desktop environment using a mouse. All menu items on all levels are clickable and appropriate pages can be accessed. When viewing my site on my iPhone however, I am unable to access the top level parent links. Clicking once on these top level links drops down the sub menu child links as expected but clicking again on the same link will not take me to that page as expected. It simply closes the drop down sub menu and I remain on the same page.p  pFrom the drop down menu on a touch screen, the sub menu links are accessible but only if there is no third level menu. When this is the case, the first click on a sub menu child link will open the third level menu and a second click will close it in the same manner as described above. In summary, I can only link to the lowest level menu items through each sub menu but I want to access all pages. p  pI hope all that makes sense.  Below are links to the javascript and css files that I used to create the menu.  If anyone can provide the changes or additional code that I require to get this working Id be very appreciative Thanks in advance  Dave.p  p[a hrefhttpwww.dynamicdrive.comdynamicindex1ddsmoothmenu.js] relnofollowhttpwww.dynamicdrive.comdynamicindex1ddsmoothmenu.js]a [a hrefhttpwww.dynamicdrive.comdynamicindex1ddsmoothmenu.css] relnofollowhttpwww.dynamicdrive.comdynamicindex1ddsmoothmenu.css]ap

Negative 19292 pMy root view controller is a UITabBarController.  Im trying to present a modal view controller over one of the tab bar controllers view controllers, but still allow the tab bar to be used to go to a different tab  in other words, I would like for the modal to only interrupt to the flow of that particular tab, not the entire app.p  pTo do this, Ive set the presenting view controllers presentation style as Over Current Context in storyboard. The problem Im having is that after presenting the modal view controller and selecting a new tab, the presenting view controllers view is removed from the window, and isnt added back to the window when dismissing the presented view controller.  After dismissing the view controller, moving to another tab and then coming back finally puts the presenting view controller back into the window.p  pIve reproduced my problem using the Tabbed template in Xcode.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comL75B3.png altp  pAfter presenting modal  Ive added transparency to the presented view controller to easily see whats going on in the presented view controller.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comCyxOK.png altp  pChanging to second tab and then back  the presenting view controllers view has now been removed. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comXZ5FS.png altp  pDismissing the modal leaves the presenting view controller with its view still removed from the window.

Negative 19292 pIm confused.

But when I restrain this behavior to only one image that is, the event listener isnt in a loop and no argument is passed to the function it just displays a preset image then all is fine. The event is triggered when I click.p  pIts actually not the first time I encounter this phenomenon of the listening function being triggered not matter what event I ask the event listener to be on the lookout for. It happens most often with alert and I honestly cant figure out why. Can someone help mep

When i removed the include directive from f1.c, it worked... It also works when i remove the extern keyword. Is extern redundantp  pf2.c i guess its ok and behaves as expected, or is it But if i put an include with header, it breaks. Why is thatp  pWhen should i use include in source files If i dont include it f1.c or f2.c it works...p  pAlso, if i define a variable as static inside a function, like static int i  0 This variable will not be destroyed when function exist, it will keep its memory and data. And next time that same function gets called, will have access to it, right But the var wont be reinitialized to 0, i.e. the line where is defines wont execute. Correctp  pLife stomps me p

Negative 19292 pOk so Ive been following this tutorial on Connect4 in java and Ive tried to modify it to fit what I already had and to fit into libgdx. After implementing it, i have a few odd problems.p  pProblem 1 After i make the first move, the computer fills the entire bottom row with his chips and then makes his first move.p  pProblem 2 The computer isnt displaying any A.I. and simply starts at the first column and first row available and places a chip there. The computer will keep following this pattern. p  pProblem 3 My winning checker no longer realizes if I have won the game but does realize when the computer has won. When I first designed the game I started by having the computer place chips at random for testing and my winning checker worked for the computer and for myself.p  pThe article I followed was here a hrefhttpsjohannes89.wordpress.com20140209teachingacomputertoplayconnectfourusingtheminimaxalgorithm relnofollowConnect4 in Javaap  pHere is my code.p  pConnectFour.javap  precodepackage com.comp452.tme31  import com.badlogic.gdx.ApplicationAdapter import com.badlogic.gdx.Gdx import com.badlogic.gdx.Input import com.badlogic.gdx.InputProcessor import com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.Color import com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.GL20 import com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.Texture import com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.g2d.BitmapFont import com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.g2d.SpriteBatch  public class ConnectFour extends ApplicationAdapter implements InputProcessor        Create final ints for number of columns and rows in game.     protected final static int COLUMNS  7     protected final static int ROWS  6     protected final static int TILESIZE  64       Create boolean to determine if player can take a turn.     protected boolean playersTurn  true       Create boolean for gameover.     protected boolean gameOver  false       Create boolean for winners.     private boolean winner  false       Sprite batch for texture drawing.

Negative 19292 pi am using Scala play evolutions and have this in application.confp  precodeevolutionpluginenabled applyEvolutions.defaulttrue applyDownEvolutions.defaulttrue codepre  pAlso i have this sql script in one evolutionp  precodeALTER TABLE User ADD Level INT10 NOT NULL DEFAULT 1, codepre  pHowever when i start Play2 in PROD mode i always get this errorp  precodeDuplicate column name Level [ERROR1060, SQLSTATE42S21] codepre  pWhen i check database before starting app playevolutions row has state applied on corrensponding script, but after starting up , it changes to applyingup , it looks like that evolutions are starting over and over everytime. How can i apply only new evolutions and not applying every evolution from start Now its pain in the ass because when i add new column to table i also need to have down script to first drop that column and up script to add this column, but this leads to dropping also all data on that column in production database. Am i missing something with evolutions For me evolution should only continue when it ended last time not everytime from scratch.p  pThank youp

Negative 19292 h2The problemh2  pI am implementing a class where I want to let the user choose the string type codestdstringcode, codestdwstringcode, codestdu16stringcode, ... via a template parameter. I currently fail to make the string literals emfitem the chosen string type Once I decide for a literal prefix codehellocode vs. codeLhellocode vs. codeuhellocode vs. codeUhellocode, I get compilation errors for all incompatible string classes.p  h2Toy exampleh2  pAs an example, consider the following code compile with codestdc11codep  precodeinclude ltstringgt  templatelttypename StringTypegt void hellostring      StringType resulthello   int main       works     hellostringltstdstringgt     hellostringltstdbasicstringltchargtgt       the code below does not compile     hellostringltstdwstringgt     hellostringltstdbasicstringltunsigned chargtgt     hellostringltstdu16stringgt  codepre  pFunction codehellostringcode shows the essence of what I want to do have a string type as template parameter, and assign string literals to variables of this type.p  h2Possible workaroundh2  pOne way to overcome my problem would be to implement several specializations of the codehellostringcode function. The problem is that this would lead to several copies of each string literal  one for each string literal prefix.

While this would avoid code duplication, it would introduce unnecessary conversions of something that is actually constant.p

Ive downloaded IntelliJ community edition, and Im able to compile small IntelliJ plugins if I follow the above documentation, but when I try to compile the source for an Android Studio plugin, it tells me it cant find the import codeorg.jetbrains.android.facet.AndroidFacetcodep  pMy thinking is that Ive probably missed an SDK somewhere, but, for the life of me, I cant determine which additional SDKlibrary I need to import to get the Androidspecific suite of classes.p  pCould someone guide me in the right direction to get a plugin to build to use Android Studio If it packages it as a zip file rather than launching Android Studio with the plugin embedded, thats fine  I can manually copy over my .zip files to my Android Studio installation to test.p

From trying to google around to look for similar problems it sounds like the issue might be because is there isnt a delete[] happening. But these are not temporary arrays, I keep using these again and again. Im further confused because in my real code not this test example I use new[] else where in a similar fashion and valgrind does not complain about it i.e. it is data that is continually updated so I never end up using delete[].p  pAm I really misusing new[] here Or is valgrind just complaining about the potential for abusep  pemEDITem Okay, I definitely see how I was failing to delete a and b in the respective functions that return a and b. However, in main, I use a and b through out the program. I guess my question now is, is it correct usage to delete every single variable and array created. i.e. should the end of main always consist of a bunch of deletes I just feel like I havent seen this in other peoples code. p

Negative 19292 pI have developed a hybrid worklight app and everything is set up. Now my case is that I have a load balance and two clusters. These two clusters have been synchronized with only one WAR file. Due to some reason, we have a server java file in the WAR for sharing some global variables with worklight adapters.p  pThe problem now is that these 2 clusters are working independently will be redirected by the load balance. The global variables in the JAVA file inside their WAR will not be shared. How can we maintain only one set of global variable in this casep  pOr is there any method for the JAVA to read the current cluster detailfor example cluster id or IP address so that I can write logic to point to different properties in worklight.propertiesp  p[PS not good at English.

Negative 19292 pI am working on a Java 8 Spring project and wanted to use Lombok to reduce boilerplate code. Since I need a Javadoc, I set up the lombokmavenplugin and the mavenjavadocplugin.p  pAfter running the lombokdelombok goal the source is generated to targetgeneratedsourcesdelombok, as I specified it.

Negative 19292 pI am misunderstanding how to set up a web socket connection between a client and a server. p  pIn my mind a HTTP GET request expects a response and then that is the full lifetime of the request.  When talking about web sockets now I am reading that the server responds with a 101 Switching Protocols and then magically opens a web socket connection to that client. How, on the client side, do they handle the again, magic stream of data that the server may now send them p  pIn my mind a regular request may be executed as suchp  precode        HttpWebRequest request  HttpWebRequestHttpWebRequest.Createhttpslocalhostsomething         request.Method  GET         request.GetResponse codepre  pEven if that getResponse returned a 101, what more has to be done on the client side to receive data On the server sidep  pI am looking for a pointer to some documentation that highlights the actual implementation. I prefer to not use a library  in a specific language as I want any client to be able to initiate a web socket connection through a normal HTTP GET request. p

Negative 19292 pIm pretty new to jni.p  pI need to invoke a native method from java code, which should perform a timeconsuming operation asynchronously in another thread, and at the end it should invoke a java callback. However I need this callback to be invoked in the same java thread that originated the operation. That is, the java application should be singlethreaded, and all callbacks should be invoked in the context of this thread.p  pIve read tutorials on callback invocations, the stuff about keeping global refs to the object, getting the appropriate methodid and invoking it. Ive also found stuff about how to call a java method from another thread codeAttachCurrentThreadcode, however this is not what I need. I need to make the java call within the originating thread, so the question is how do I switch to that threadp  pFor instance, in Win32 Id use something like codePostMessagecodecodePostThreadMessagecode to invoke a code in the specified thread, assuming it runs the messageloop. Therere also alternatives like codeQueueUserAPCcode which is applicable if the thread waits for events in an alertable state.p  pSo, what are the options at my disposal Is there a jni method for posting execution of a java method in the specified thread Or perhaps a linux equivalent of codePostThreadMessagecode I can also think about workarounds within the java code, but prefer to solve this on the native side.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 19292 pI have created a treemap with zoom functionality. The treemap is colored based on the parent. Now when I click on any of the parent rectangles, it zooms in and shows all the children within it clearly. It is correctly displaying the children, however, I need to maintain the same color which I had used while clicking on the parent to zoom in as the parent remains the same. For instance Parent 1 has an orange color, parent 2 has a yellow color. Now when I click on parent 1 it should still show the children in orange color and not in any other color. It should be based on the legend provided.p  pAlso, another issue that I am facing is when I try to zoom out i.e. go back it shows me the parent name along with the children name which I do not want. I just want to see the children name something that we see when we first time open the treemap. For instance  first time when we open the treemap, I am able to see multiple rectangles and each rectangle having some text that text is the child name. Now when i zoom in and then come back, in the left hand corner of each colored rectangle  there are 9 colored rectagles  Parent you can see additional text which is the parent text. How can I get rid of that.p  pHow do we restrict the treemap to only one level of navigation, mine takes up to 2 levels.p  pPlease find below link to get more details about my treemap. a hrefhttpbl.ocks.orggeetanjaliranad78c3f81eabf5f8ca7ac relnofollowhttpbl.ocks.orggeetanjaliranad78c3f81eabf5f8ca7acap  pRegardsp
Negative 19292 pI am working on a mostly computebound application.  For simplicity, think of it as a set of worker threads pulling blocks of work off an atomic queue, processing them, and then combining them back together in an output buffer.p  pIn my tests, I have a Windows 7 machine with a 6core Intel 990x 12 hardware threads, and so I create 12 threads.p  pHere are some graphs of the performance three trials a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comI0ZPJ.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comI0ZPJ.png alttrial onea a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comvnpVo.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comvnpVo.png alttrial twoa a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comaq2hi.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comaq2hi.png alttrial threeap  pAfter a serial initialization phase, you can see the 12 threads all start pulling work, work in parallel, and then terminate when theres none left.  Thread contention appears in orange theres practically none.p  pHowever, notice the weird square wave pattern that occurs occasionally a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comyjrIi.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comyjrIi.png altsquare waveap  pThis translates into a significant performance loss.  In trials where it doesnt happen very often, the performance is significantly faster.p  hr  pOne thing Ive noticed is that the waves like to trade off with each otherthat is, the peaks of one thread coincide with the troughs of another.p  pThis suggests one worker thread is being preempted by another.  This is bad, since the CPU has enough resources to run all 12 threads at the same time.p  pTherefore, my suspicion is that this is an OSlevel thread scheduling issue.  If not, what is it  What should I look into to start fixing itp

The ones I could understand are no longer compatible with Win 7 or higherCould someone help me by directing me in the right path.

If the script is cross platform, it would be even more awesome.p
