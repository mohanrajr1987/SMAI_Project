Positive 6101 pIm making a backend API using RESTlet and JAXRS on app engine. Id like to make a method that is called before each request to check whether the user is authenticated has to make a query to an external API via HTTP and then continue or stop depending.p  pHow could I do thisp  pThanks, Danielp

I am very new to jboss and resteasy.p  pI am having a trouble with finding a tutorial for integrating JBoss JAAS into Resteasy JAXRS. p  pI would like to provide two restful APIs in resteasy application one is used for loggingin and the other one is for loggingout. p  pin the loggingin method, I would like to create a LoginContext object with user credentials from the request and call its LoginContext.login method to authenticate the user. After that, set a cookie on the request. I dont really know if this is possible, I know I can createmodify cookie header with resteasy, but I am not sure about if its possible to convert that LoginContext to a session id p  panother solution I can think of is to create a session id and keep a mapping between that session id with LoginContext. However, that would significantly increase complexity of the resteasy application which I would like to avoid. it also doesnt make sense if there is no conventional way to automatically bind these information to a web sessionp  pAny suggestionssolutions are welcome. a sample code or tutorial would be much appreciate. p  pemI am using is JBoss AS 6 and resteasyjaxrs2.1.0.GA.jar.em p

Positive 6101 pI am currently working on a RESTeasy based RESTful service. I have a filter class which serves as a server request filter as well as a server response filter i.e. it implements codeContainerRequestFiltercode and codeContainerResponseFiltercode interfaces. p  pAt the beginning of the request, I use the filter to put an object into codeThreadLocalcode. This object is used by the resources throughout the request. At the end of the request, before sending out the response, the filter removes the object from codeThreadLocalcode.p  pMy question is that is there a guarantee that the the request filter, the resource and the response filter will all execute in the same thread Is there a possibility that after the request filter puts the object into codeThreadLocalcode, a different thread will execute the request and thus not have access to the objectp  pI was sure that this was the case but then I saw this a hrefhttpjersey.576304.n2.nabble.comDoesfiltermethodofContainerRequestFilterruninresourcemethodthreadtd7582648.html relnofollowhttpjersey.576304.n2.nabble.comDoesfiltermethodofContainerRequestFilterruninresourcemethodthreadtd7582648.htmla official Jersey forum and now I have doubts.p

Negative 6101 pI have a set of shapes which need to be drawn on top of each other. I need to reorder them such that the smallest shape gets drawn last i.e. it will be closest to the user. Is there any way to check whether a shape overlappes encloses andor intersects another shape. I know there is a method in codeRectcode structure called codeContainscode which checks whether there is an object within it. Is there a similar method or a way to simulate it on Shapes in WPF Thanks in advance for any help.p  pCheers,p  pNilup
Negative 6101 pDoes anyone have some useful beginner tutorials and code snippets for playing with basic geometric shapes and geometric proofs in codep  pIn particular something with the ability to easily create functions and recursively draw them on the screen. Additional requirements, but not absolute, support for ObjectiveC and basic window drawing routines for OS X and Cocoa.p  pA specific question how would one write a test to validate that a shape is in fact a square, triangle, etc. The idea being that you could draw a bunch of shapes, fit them together and test and analyze the emergent shape that arises from the set of sub shapes. p  pThis is not a homework question. I am not in school. Just wanted to experiment with drawing code and geometry. And looking for an accessible way to play and experiment with shapes and geometry programming.p  pI am open to Java and Processing, or ActionscriptHaXe and Flash but would also like to use Objective C and Xcode to build projects as well.p  pWhat I am looking for are some clear tutorials to get me started down the path.p  pSome specific applications include clear examples of how to display for example parts of a Cantor Set, Mandelbrot Set, Julia set, etc...p  pOne aside, I was reading on Wikipedia about the a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiRussell27s5Fparadox relnofollowRussells Paradoxa. And the wiki article statedp  blockquote   pLet us call a set abnormal if it is   a member of itself, and normal   otherwise. strongFor example, take the set   of all squares. That set is not itself   a square, and therefore is not a   member of the set of all squares.strong So   it is normal. On the other hand, if   we take the complementary set that   contains all nonsquares, that set is   itself not a square and so should be   one of its own members. It is   abnormal.p blockquote  pThe point about squares seems intuitively wrong to me. All the squares added together seem to imply a larger square. Obviously I get the larger paradox about sets. But what I am curious about is playing around with shapes in code and analyzing them empirically in code. So for example a potential routine might be draw four squares, put them together with no space between them, and analyze the dimensions and properties of the new shape that they make. p  pPerhaps even allowing free hand drawing with a mouse. But for now just drawing in code is fine.  p

Negative 6101 pSo a coworker and I are in a fairly heated debate. We are beginning a new project and we are attempting to use BDD. We are both firsttimers and dont fully understand what practices should be used. Weve written some specs and we are now implementing the code. Things are getting pretty tricky since there is a lot of database interaction. We are stuck on how we should mock our data. The method we were going about would require us to mock our methods instead of our data. Its easiest if I show you in code...p  precodepublic static void AssignLeadToDistributorint leadId, int distributorId      Lead lead  GetByIdleadId     lead.DistributorId  distributorId     Savelead  codepre  pBasically, we would have to override GetById and Save to return mock data for us to test this. It seems to make more sense to do it like thisp  precodepublic static void AssignLeadToDistributorLead lead, Distributor distributor     lead.DistributorId  distirbutor.Id  codepre  pThen we could just mock our objects.p  pClearly the second method makes it easier to test. However, the argument is that we dont want to have to fetch a new lead and distributor object on our front end code, because it would be easier to just pass the ids of our objects. Cutting down on the actual code in our front end.p  pHopefully I explained that well enough.p  pWhat do you guys think Which way makes more sensep

Negative 6101 pWe are working together with another firm. our application communicates with the other application through WCF on our side and a custom implemented java wsdl handler on the other side. They specify the wsdl format and one of the rules is that a specific string cannot contain more then 15 characters. normally its 60, but i take 15 for easy example reasonsp  pWhen we try to send the following string to them we get an error that the string is too long according to the wsdlp  pcodeexample amp testcode   this is a string of  14 characters, so it should be allowedp  pthe microsoft wcf parser translates this to codeexample ampamp testcode . This encoded string is 18 characters long.p  pNow what is the standaard behavior to check a maxlength defined in a message Is it the encoded message or the decoded message I would think its the decoded message , but i aint sure. If it is the encoded message, how should we handle this so we would know how we have to split the stringp

Negative 6101 pIve got a problem with multiple deadlocks on SQL server 2005. This one is between an INSERT and a SELECT statement.p  pThere are two tables. Table 1 and Table2. Table2 has Table1s PK table1id as foreign key.br Index on table1id is clustered.p  pThe INSERT inserts a single row into table2 at a time.br The SELCET joins the 2 tables. its a long query which might take up to 12 secs to runp  pAccording to my understanding and experiments the INSERT should acquire an IS lock on table1 to check referential integrity which should not cause a deadlock.

Negative 6101 pFirst of all I am very thankful to the owner of this website. I have learned and implement various technologies with the help of solutions provided by the readers.p  pI know the question I asked is posted many time in this forum. And I have tired all of the solutions available, but no luck I may case I am trying to read a dat file which is basically a msgfeed file having more than 22000 Characters. Every line may or may not be of same length. My requirement is to convert the file to fixed line length character file. I have a logic that work well using vb script, however its pretty slow.  I have checked with For f but no luck. The only delimiter I have is emEOT, which i can see in Textpad but not in notepad. I have tried with n, tokenem.  Please help me in resolving the issue.

Negative 6101 pSomething very odd is going on. Its been going on for some time, but Ive just ignored it up to now. I have both a Silverlight and WCF service in my solution, which shares .CS file between them one project has a link to the file, which exists in the other project. While debugging the Silverlight app, pressing the F10 key steps through code as normal, and when I get to a method call which exists in the shared file between the projects, and Press F11, it simply skips the method instead of stepping into it and yes, the Just My Code option is not checked. If I put a breakpoint in the method Im trying to get into, it works fine as in the debugger will break on the line, but as soon as I step F10 it exits the method and with F11 [step into] also.p  pOk, on first thought, you might think its to do with the link, but no, it isnt. I tried removing the link and using a copy instead, but the same thing happens. And no, its not the debug symbols, I looked into that already.p  pThe method Im trying to step through is static, and is in a nonstatic partial class, in a file shared by both projects.p  pMy guess The same types and static methods exist in the WCF and Silverlight ... would the debugger get confusedp

However id like to prefilter my submitted values, so adding ucfirst, strtoupper, and the like.p  pIm not sure if im missing something crucial here, but the way i see it is the only way to do this would be to create my own custom validators and utilizing the doClean method, which seems daft since id have hundreds of validators for each php functionp  pHope you guys can help, ive been crawling through source code, apis, numerous books and blogs and i havent found a thing  Either its impossible, or its really easy, i hope its the latterp
Negative 6101 pI have been monitoring the parameters a website receives when a file is uploaded via an input typefile.

Negative 6101 pI have a programming question, as follows, for which my solution does not produce the desired outputp  blockquote   pThis particle simulator operates in a universe with different laws of physics to ours. Each particle has a position x, y, velocity vx, vy and an acceleration ax, ay. Every particle exerts an attractive force on every other particle. This force is the same regardless of how far away the particle is.br   The acceleration of a particle in the x direction is given by  p      piaxnumber of particles to right of xnumber of particles to left of x  10.0i  p      pThe particle will then move left or right with velocity vx  ax.br   Similarly, the acceleration of a particle in the y direction is given by  p      piaynumber of particles above ynumber of particles below y  10.0ip      pThe particle will then move up or down with velocity vy  ay.br   The particles are bound in a chamber with dimensions 300 lt x lt 300 and 200 lt y lt 200. If a particle hits the wall of the chamber it should bounce. Bouncing involves setting the x or y coordinate to the boundary, and reversing the direction of the velocity. For example, if a particle ends up with position x305 then you should set x300 and vx  vx. Note that x must be set to the integer value 300 in order to get the same output values as our test cases.p      pWrite a program to read in a file named particles.txt containing the initial positions, velocities and accelerations of a number of particles. The first line of the file contains the number of iterations to run the simulation for 5 in this example. Every other row contains data about one particle, in the format x y vx vy ax ay like this  p      pcode5codebr   code0 30 3 0 0 0codebr   code100 50 0 1 0 0codebr   code20 10 0 3 0 0codebr   code80 15 2 2 0 0code  p      pYour program should create a Particle object to store the data for each particle.

Negative 6101 pAlthough I am sure I will use Flash to display my games in browsers what I am not sure about is if I should use the Flash Authoring Tool to draw my characters which I want to be vector based characters or if I should code everything in AS3.p  pMaybe it is just a personal thing but I would rather code everything by hand with the Flex SDK and compile it with the command line compiler. Is this logical or should I really think about using the Flash Authoring Tool to draw my characters and code it in with flexp  pHopefully get some AS3 developers out there with experience enough to answer this question.p

Negative 6101 pI am using Flash Builder 4 and need a VideoDisplay component that works with Cue Points.  The newer version of thea hrefhttpwww.opensourcemediaframework.com relnofollowOSMFa classes that Flexs VideoDisplay are based on handles this already.  The idea is to roll my own VideoDisplay component rather than monkey patch the existing one.  To do this, I have created a project with the newer version of the OSMF classes, and another project with which I would build the new VideoDisplay, in a separate package name.p  pThe issue is that since the Flex 4.1 SDK contains the majority of the OSMF classes with their original package names, a statement such as codeimport org.osmf.media.MediaPlayercode references the class located at p  blockquote   pCProgram FilesAdobeAdobe Flash   Builder   4sdks4.1.0frameworksprojectsp blockquote  pand not the MediaPlayer class in the newer version of OSMF.p  pIve tried to rename the packages in the OSMF project so that it is distinctly named, but I get an exception from the IDE an unexpected exception occurred during precondition checking.  See the error log for more details.p  pDoes the SDK always rightfully win in a fight  Is there some dirty way to force a project to prefer a reference to an swcproject over an identically named SDK classp  pAny suggestions welcome.p  pstrongEditstrong Given the comments, Ive apparently done a poor job of explaining my problem.  So here it goes again.p  pFlex uses an older, less capable version of the OSMF platform for its VideoPlayer. I need to use the new version that includes support for cue points.  I have downloaded the newer OSMF source and it is in its own project.  I would prefer to NOT have to rename the packages in this project for the sake of future maintainability.p  pThe VideoPlayer I will implement is in a second project that strongDOES NOTstrong duplicate the package names of either the Flex SDK or OSMF.  The conflict is between the Flex SDK and OSMF, not between the classes I would build and either OSFM or the SDK.  My project needs  to access classes in the OSMF project, not those from the Flex SDK that have the name packageclass names.  Because the Flex SDK is based on OSMF, Flex has left the package and namespace identifies intact, thus the naming ambiguity.  p

Negative 6101 pI am working on an embedded OpenGL graphics application running on an Intel Atom z530 with the GMA500 graphics hardware. Its my understanding that the GMA500 is a PowerVR under the hood, but Im not sure. Im running with the Tungsten Graphics Gallium driver on Ubuntu 9.10 Karmic Koala. Oh, you should also know that i have 1 GB of available system memory.p  pHeres the problem I have code that allocates a bunch of 512x512x32 textures about 1MB apiece. When I get to about 118120 of these, I get an out of memory error from OpenGL, and I also get this message on the console error INTELESCAPEALLOCREGION failed.p  pThis, along with simple measurements while looking at top, indicate to me that Im hitting up against an 128MB limit for textures. The odd thing is this this architecture doesnt have dedicated video ram, its shared. And I can tell for sure that OpenGL is using system ram for the textures because I can see the free ram going down in top. So why would I get an out of memory error I would expect opengl to simply use more of my available system ram. Why would there be such a hard limit Is there some way to change what this apparent hard limit is set top  pThanks Chrisp  hr  pHeres my output from glxinfop  precode glxinfo  name of display 0.0 display 0  screen 0 direct rendering Yes server glx vendor string SGI server glx version string 1.2 server glx extensions     GLXARBmultisample, GLXEXTvisualinfo, GLXEXTvisualrating,      GLXEXTimportcontext, GLXEXTtexturefrompixmap, GLXOMLswapmethod,      GLXSGImakecurrentread, GLXSGISmultisample, GLXSGIXhyperpipe,      GLXSGIXswapbarrier, GLXSGIXfbconfig, GLXMESAcopysubbuffer client glx vendor string SGI client glx version string 1.4 client glx extensions     GLXARBgetprocaddress, GLXARBmultisample, GLXEXTimportcontext,      GLXEXTvisualinfo, GLXEXTvisualrating, GLXMESAallocatememory,      GLXMESAcopysubbuffer, GLXMESAswapcontrol,      GLXMESAswapframeusage, GLXOMLswapmethod, GLXOMLsynccontrol,      GLXSGImakecurrentread, GLXSGIswapcontrol, GLXSGIvideosync,      GLXSGISmultisample, GLXSGIXfbconfig, GLXSGIXpbuffer,      GLXSGIXvisualselectgroup, GLXEXTtexturefrompixmap GLX version 1.2 GLX extensions     GLXARBgetprocaddress, GLXARBmultisample, GLXEXTimportcontext,      GLXEXTvisualinfo, GLXEXTvisualrating, GLXMESAswapcontrol,      GLXOMLswapmethod, GLXSGImakecurrentread, GLXSGISmultisample,      GLXSGIXfbconfig, GLXEXTtexturefrompixmap OpenGL vendor string Tungsten Graphics, Inc.

Negative 6101 pstrongProblem statement strong The virtual keyboard is required in linux environment which should be launched every time when user presses on editable UI components, like virtual keyboard in iPhone, iPad, Android, etc.p  pstrongSolution overview strong As basis for virtual keyboard was taken matchboxkeyboard which is an opensource application and provides rich functionality. The mechanism of autotoggling was solved by modifying the source of QT and GTK to send Dbus signals on onpress signal when user presses on editable UI comp. to some daemon which turns virtual keyboard on.p  pstrongIssue strong onpress Dbus signal is sent when user presses or clicks on UI components i.e. during onclick event of QT and GTK. The virtual keyboard is hidden on focusout event of QT and GTK. Keyboard is not switched on during focusin event because some application while launching are emitting focusin event for a moment then emitting focusout event, so virtual keyboard was shows for a short time then hidden which was not accurate. this was solved by generating onpress Dbus signal during onclick GTK and QT events. p  pSo now here I have another problem.p  ol liLets say user pressed on editable box, virtual keyboard appeared,  onclick GTK, QT event  onpress Dbus signal  virtual keyboard is launchedli liThen user presses on Tab button to switch to other editable box. focusout GTK, QT event  hidekeyboard Dbus signal  virtual keyboard is hidden and is not launched again.li ol  pThis happens because the second editable box emits focusin event and not onclick event. p  pSo please help to find a solution for the case when user switches between editable box with tab button. Or if you have totally other solution please suggest it.p  pThanks in advance, Levonp
Negative 6101 phere is my scenario. In my Junit tests, in many places, I need to provide user name, description, url, invalid url etc. So I hard coded those values. It is not good to hard code everywhere. So I want to move those values to a centralized place a file. And I have some data provider say DP. I can call DP.getUserName, DP.getUrl etc. at places where need those values. Also, I want to have a pool of different user names, urls, invalid urls etc. When I call getUrl, it will randomly pick up on from the pool.p  pWhat I can think of is to use java.util.Properties to load propertis from a file and each time I call, I just randomly return one entry.p  pAny better approach to achieve this goal thanks.p

Negative 6101 pWe have a model which gets a sequence number from the ID of another model, using autoincrement on the other models table.  That value gets set to zero whenever the db server is restarted, so the sequence numbers reset.  To work around this, in an afterinitialize block, we set the autoincrement value to the maximum sequence value plus one, and all is well.p  pHowever, in the tests, the block runs before fixtures are loaded, so the maximum comes back as nil.  Then when the tests run, the value is too low and so the tests fail.p  pOne possible solution is to update the value in a setup block, but altering the table commits the current transaction and so the rollback at the end of the test fails.p  pHow do I alter the AUTOINCREMENT value after fixtures are loaded, but embeforeem the savepoint is createdp

Negative 6101 pIm implementing a mechanism similar to the observer design pattern for a multithreaded Tetris game. There is a Game class which contains a collection of EventHandler objects. If a class wants to register itself as a listener to a Game object it must inherit the GameEventHandler class.

We want the notification to occur in the main thread.li liThe event is wrapped in a boostfunction and sent as a PostMessage to the main thread.li liA short time later this function object is processed by the main thread while the Game object is already deleted. The result is a crash.li ulli ol  pMy current workaround is the one that you can see in above code sample. I made the codeUnregisterEventHandlercode a static method which checks against a list of instances.

Negative 6101 pBackground to this problem. I have an appwidget associated with my app that updates at set intervals periodically, using an Update Service that does http posts to server and updates the widget with data received from the server.p  pWhat I have noticed from my tests and user reports is that this particular instance of force close happens periodically but rare when its time for the widget to update and the network state changes from available to unavailable. Since I have noticed this on my phone in NYC subways.p  pWhile debugging I figured that if the http post has happened and the network state changes before the response has been received, it basically receives a IOException.

Negative 6101 pSo I have a 3d object that I created and imported into XAML format and into Viewport3d. We have another C object that is used from a book. The issue is that it is a parent object and trying to put the code behind file under the new object in C creates a parent vs. parent conflict. I decided to make a c class out of it as I need multiple instances of the object. Ive been translating all the XAML code to C but Im stuck at the positions, normals, amp texture coordinates of the XAML object. If there was an easier workaround instead of translating it, it would make my day. Can anyone help please It would be much appreciated. p

Negative 6101 pIm planning on making an app that contains a piano keyboard. There will be a custom class that represents an individual key, and the keys will be the subviews of another custom class, the piano class. An instance of the piano class will then be instantiated into a viewcontroller. p  pI need a class for the keys because when a touch event occurs, I need to know which key is being pressed. When a touch event actually occurs, the key will notify the piano which key it is through delegation, and the piano will respond by relaying that same information to the viewcontroller, also through delegation.p  pThe reason that I dont want the info to be passed from the key straight to the viewcontroller is that Im not going to be directly instantiating instances of the key class in the vc, and it would be more readable the former way.p  pIs passing info from the key to the piano to the viewcontroller bad designp

Negative 6101 pI have been using a hrefhttppivotal.github.comjasmineJasminea to write BDD tests for a web app.  I am interested in running these same tests from the command line using a hrefhttpwww.mozilla.orgrhinoRhinoa, and I found this a hrefhttpwww.builddoctor.com20101208javascriptbddjasmineblog entrya which has been very helpful.  However my app uses a hrefhttppusher.compushera, which offers a simple API for passing events between clients using web sockets.  p  pMy tests run fine from a browser, but running them via Rhino fails to connect to pusher.  Pusher offers a debug stream, and it would show authentication errors or other failures, but it doesnt register any activity when I run my tests from the command line.p  pThis may be a simple yes or no answer, but I havent been able to locate any relevant documentation, and Im brand new to Rhino so I apologize if this is a total n00b question.  p  pstrongMy questionstrongbr As the title says, does anyone know if Rhino supports the websockets API  Am I doing something else wrong here, or will scripts that rely on websockets simply not work via Rhino  p  pMy overall goal was to use my already written jasmine tests as stress tests by running them on several EC2 instances at once is there a good simple way to do this while reusing my existing javascript tests, or should I suck it up and just write my stress tests in a server side scripting language  I am aware of selenium grid, but was hoping to avoid having to spawn new browsers to run these tests, if possible.  p  pThanks so much p

For a coding C class, were  to use a total of nine functions and a header file were calling it my.h to collect the length and width of a room ints, the percent discount also an int, and the unit price of the carpet a double.  Were to use the input to calculate the total cost to install the carpet.  I can get the length, width and area to print, but not the unit price.  It prints frin from the ReadData.c and the CalcValue.c functions, but not in InstallPrice.c, which is called in CalcValue.c.  unitprice is read at the same time as length and width, but somehow, its not passed correctly. Im not sure why.  Maybe it does require a different pointer.  Any help would be immensely appreciated.

Negative 6101 pIve started using GAE for its high performance. When I found out that it doesnt have all the features I needed static ip for the app, custom ports, I figured I would need to find some proxy server with similarly high performance as a workaround. My app is still in early stages of development, so there is no problem in tailoring it for this solution.p  pWhat notable cloudbased proxy servers can you recommend for use with Google App Engine to complement what cant be done in GAEp

Negative 6101 pI have read through all the threads out there that looked as if they could solve my problem and Ive also read all the answers on here, but Im still at my wits end. Im not sure why the exception is thrown, although I have a feeling this might be to do with codethreadingcode. If it does, please let me know where to include the codenew Runnablecodeand whether to codeinvokeLatercode or codeinvokeAndWaitcode, as I have tried it to no avail.p  pPlease bear with me while I give you the code that leads to the exception  the stacktrace below.p  pstrongEDITstrong I had included a number of codesysocodes in the codeAnnoTablecode section just before codetableChangedcode is called and they dont show up in the console, hence I think the problem must occur even before the application gets to that point, i.e. either when its called from codeAAViewcode or when data and table model are instantiated...p  pstrongEDIT IIstrong The problem was the overwritten codetableChangedcode method. That would obviously fire an Exception. Ive removed the codetableChangedcode call which wouldnt make a difference as well. Now Ive got another problem understanding how a change in the underlying data codeAnnoDatacode can automatically update the table. Although this is perhaps for another query after an extended Google search, please feel free to post helpful comments in this thread, as Ill continue reading it... THANKS A LOT for all the helpful comments and tipsp  pstrongEDIT IIIstrong Ive solved the problem. I needed to instantiate another object from codeAnnoDatacode, pass that to a new instance of codeAnnoTableModelcode, set this instance to my table and THEN codefireTableDataChangedcode.p  pstrongEDIT IVstrong Okay, so codefireTableDataChangedcode as used in EDIT III is unnecessary after all. I still would want to use it rather than creating new objects all the time. I guess I sohuld ask a new question...

Negative 6101 pIve noticed on a number of occasions in the past, C and C code that uses the following format for these structuresp  precodeclass Vector3      float components[3]     etc.   class Matrix4x4      float components[16]     etc.   class Quaternion      float components[4]     etc.  codepre  pMy question is, will this lead to any better cache performance than say, thisp  precodeclass Quaternion      float x     float y     float z     etc.  codepre  p...Since Id assume the class members and functions are in contiguous memory space, anyway I currently use the latter form because I find it more convenient however I can also see the practical sense in the array form, since it allows one to treat axes as arbitrary dependant on the operation being performed.p  hr  pAfer taking some advice from the respondents, I tested the difference and it is actually slower with the array  I get about 3 difference in framerate. I implemented operator[] to wrap the array access inside the Vector3. Not sure if this has anything to do with it, but I doubt it since that should be inlined anyway. The only factor I could see was that I could no longer use a constructor initializer list on codeVector3x, y, zcode. However when I took the original version and changed it to no longer use constructor initialiser lists, it ran very marginally slower than before less than 0.05. No clue, but at least now I know the original approach was faster.p

Negative 6101 pMy app uses a preloaded SQLLite database with coredata bindings. I create the preloaded database file with a secondary app that has the core data bindingsmodel etc. I put the preloaded db into my apps resources folder and copy that to the writable documents folder when the app is first run.p  pMy question is about migration. Since my app released, my users have been creating data and in my next release I want to change the data model and migrate some of the data to the new model. Im just not sure the best way to do this. Ive read about core data migration methods but they seem to require my app to be a core data project, which it isnt though my secondary databasecreating app is. Will I have to do this migration manually by issuing direct SQL statements against the db And what about the core data bindings, will I have to manually update them p  pIm really just looking for pointers in the rightbest direction.

Anyways, heres the code p  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt include ltstdlib.hgt  define TRUE 1 define FALSE 0   typedef struct Node    int value   struct Node left   struct Node right  Node   void add Node node, int value    if value lt nodegtvalue      left side      if nodegtleft  NULL        Node newNode  mallocsizeofNode       newNodegtvalue  value       newNodegtleft  NULL       newNodegtright  NULL        nodegtleft  newNode      else    addnodegtleft, value         else      right side      if nodegtright  NULL        Node newNode  mallocsizeofNode       newNodegtvalue  value       newNodegtleft  NULL       newNodegtright  NULL       nodegtright  newNode      else        addnodegtright, value           int searchNode node, int value    if node  NULL      return FALSE    else if nodegtvalue  value      return TRUE    else      if value lt nodegtvalue        return searchnodegtleft, value      else        return searchnodegtright, value           int main int argc, char argv[]    Node root    root.value  23   root.left  NULL   root.right  NULL     addamproot, 5   addamproot, 50   addamproot, 8   addamproot, 2   addamproot, 34     if searchamproot, 23      printf23 lives in the tree.n    else      printf23 does not live in the tree.n       if searchamproot, 42      printf42 lives in the tree.n    else      printf42 does not live in the tree.n       return 0  codepre  pThe code might seem long but it is actually pretty basic. I think I coulda cut some of the code out before pasting it here but I figured I would leave everything in in case I took out something vital to the problem. p  pAlso I thought it might have something to do with the Node thing so in my codemaincode method I put a quick codeprintfhicode before the codeNode rootcode to see if that would make a difference but it still gave me the same error. And I have another program on my account on this school server and that program has some codeprintfcode statements and it runs just fine. p  pI tried Googling the problem but all this weird Linux threads came up and I couldnt really understand it. My computer is Windows but I did all this coding in a program called emacs that I got to through a program called PuTTY that lets me connect to the school Linux server.p  pAlso I compiled it with codegcc o tree tree.ccode.p  pSorry for all the writing, I was just trying to give as much information as possible. Thanks to anyone who can help p

The control exposes dependency properties because I want to be able to bind to them when I use the control. The codeFrameworkElementcode emNotBananaBindingem lets me create dependency properties because it is a codeDependencyObjectcode so i can bind stuff for the validation. The ValidationRule has a emNotBananaBindingem property that stores the dependency property and uses it in the validate method.p  pI know my property names are kinda crappy, sorry. The thing is that the example does a good job of displaying the error. In my haste to make an example I didnt name the variables very well.

Negative 6101 pI am trying to draw a linear CGGradient on an angle.

Negative 6101 pIm wondering if there is a emstandardem or normal means of interpreting time interval data end points with respect to inclusivenessexclusiveness of the value defining the end point. Note however that I am asking what the standard or most common strongemconventionemstrong is if there is one, not for a dissertation on your personal preference. If you really want to provide a dissertation, please attach it to a reference to someones published standard or a standard text on the matter. Open standards that I dont have to pay to read are greatly preferred unless they are fundamentally flawed .p  pOf course there are 4 possibilities for a time interval from A to Bp  ol liA, B  Both ends are exclusive.li li[A, B]  Both ends are inclusive.li li[A, B  Start is inclusive and end is exclusiveli liA, B]  Start is exclusive and end is inclusiveli ol  pEach of these has different characteristics as I see it, feel free to point out morep  pThe [A, B] convention would have the seemingly inconvenient property that B is contained withing the inteval [A, B] and also [B, C]. This is particularly inconvenient if B is meant to represent the midnight boundary and you are trying to determine which day it falls on for example. Also, this means the duration of the interval is slightly irritatig to calculate since [A, B] where A  B should have a length of 1 and therefore the duration of [A, B] is B  A strong 1strong p  pSimilarly the A, B convention would have the difficulty that B falls within neither A,B nor B,C... continuing the analogy with day boundaries, midnight would be part of neither day. This is also logically inconvenient because [A, B] where A  B is a nonsense interval with duration less than zero, strongbut reversing A and B does not make it a valid intervalstrong.p  pSo I think I want either [A, B, or A, B] and I cant figure out how to decide between them. p  pSo if someone has a link to a standards document, reference to a standard text or similar  that clarify the convention that would be great. Alternately, if you can link a variety of standards documents andor references that more or less completely fail to agree, then I can just pick one that seems to have sufficient authority to CMA and be done with it . p  pFinally, I will be working in Java, so I am particularly susceptible to answers that work well in Java.p
Negative 6101 pI am writing a server side process in Python that takes XML in a directory and puts it into a database. The XML that is put in the directory is generated from forms that are filled out on remote laptops and sent via HTTP to the server. When we add fields to the form it adds tags to the XML which allows for situations where one XML file will have more or fewer tags than another. How can I make my server side script robust enough to handle these scenarios. p

Negative 6101 pI create a BitmapDrawable that I later assign to several Objects in a function like this not exactly like this but its stripped down for testing purposesp  precodeDrawable CreateBitmapint col    Bitmap b  Bitmap.createBitmap50, 50, Config.ARGB8888     Canvas c  new Canvasb     c.drawColorcol     return new BitmapDrawableb  codepre  pAnd this works and creates me a BitmapDrawable with the size 50 x 50 that I keep in memory. I then assign this BitmapDrawable to various buttons, checkboxes, whatever comes up and needs a certain color.p  pthe problem I have is that the BitmapDrawables are somehow getting truncated. It appears that if I assign it to a button with the height of 80 and then a button with the height of 160, the first is filled nicely and the latter is only filled by half. It appears the BitmapDrawable gets set to the first usage of it and all subsequent assignments are restricted by it. Sometimes it happens immediately sometimes it only happens when I switch to another tab and return back to the previous one.p  pI thought the BitmapDrawable would remain at 50x50 in memory and the object its assigned to is either getting its own version with an apropriate size or makes a resized copy when rendering and not that it somehow changes the BitmapDrawable itself. I admit, I am not sure how all of this works in depth and I would appreciate any advice on what I am doing wrong and if I do have to create individual BitmapDrawables for each object I assign them to or if I can do something else.p

Negative 6101 pI use bcrypt for password hashing in php 5.3p  pI understand that bcrypt uses a random salt that gets built into the resulting hash per item.  This makes cracking each hash difficult, and prevents cracking p  h2What I dont know is whether there still exists good reason to use an additional, applicationlevel global secret key.h2  pE.g. instead of just hashing a password string, e.g. password1 into a bcrypt hash with the random salt that is built into the bcrypt generation system  as per here a hrefhttpsgist.github.com1053158 relnofollowhttpsgist.github.com1053158a  2a08mjQAZ5cZi5B9u6zpUU4mGuRcvtxr1K.9ncYpxCdG.YhlD8yFG2mXKp  pI could also create a constant, e.g. ampBDFGGBNGYSEHYSZTHN , put that constant into the application either into the application source code or the applications configuration files, and append that to any string to be hashed. So password1ampBDFGGBNGYSEHYSZTHN  would get hashed into a different hash from just password1 alone. 2a08xFgULsrpoIYlbxp1IG3H8.kdVggyhm4aTQXrP2Ptu25nMBUjBdrrKp  pObviously in the context of the application itself, this doesnt help much.  If someone tries the password password1 on the running system, theyll succeed, because theyll automatically get the global secret key along for the ride.  But if they have the database or access to the database only, it seems like the global secret key may be an additional obstacle  Because, not knowing the global secret key, they would have to crack password1ampBDFGGBNGYSEHYSZTHN instead of just cracking password1.p  pThere are some potential benefits that may exist that I can imaginep  ul liThis might really hinder cracking the hashes using a compromised database aloneli ul  pAnd some vague disadvantages that may existp  ul liThis introduces a common thread to all strings that get hashed, which may make it easier to crack hashes if its known.li liIt increases the fragility of the data.  If the global secret key is lost, e.g. during a server migration, or whatever, the data is now trash.li ul  h2So Im trying to figure out whether its a good idea to also have a global secret key, or whether the random salt per item is both enough, and all you want.  Does anyone know of any implementations that use a global secret key, or research that suggests using ith2

Negative 6101 pI am having trouble sorting out a query making me nuts if you look at the SQL below, notice the andor.

Negative 6101 pIve read the docs about a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comguidetopicsresourcesprovidingresources.htmlBestMatch relnofollowAndroid Resourcesa and I think Ive understood the bestmatching logic used by android to identify in which directory a particular resource should be searched first.. Supposing that emdrawablehdpiem, emdrawableenportem and drawableen match the current device configuration, emdrawableenportem is the best matching directory.. My question is, if a drawable is not found in emdrawableenportem, does the system look directly in emdrawableem or does it look in the secondbestmatch emdrawableenem and then in the third best match emdrawablehdpiem and so on until it reaches emdrawableem I suppose it works this way, but I did not find it explicitly said in the docs unless Ive read them too quickly and you will surely kill me  .p
Negative 6101 pAll, here is a question about designbest practices of a complex case of canceling Tasks in C. How do you implement cancellation of a shared taskp  pAs a minimal example, lets assume the following we have a long running, cooperatively cancellable operation Work. It accepts a cancellation token as argument and throws if it has been canceled. It operates on some application state and returns a value. Its result is independently required by two UI components.p  pWhile the application state is unchanged, the value of the Work function should be cached, and if one computation is ongoing, a new request should not start a second computation but rather start waiting for a result.p  pEither of the UI components should be able to cancel its Task without affecting the other UI components task. p  pAre you with me so far p  pThe above can be accomplished by introducing an Task cache that wraps the real Work task in TaskCompletionSources, whose Tasks are then returned to the UI components. If a UI component cancels its Task, it only abandons the TaskCompletionSource Task and not the underlying task. This is all good. The UI components creates the CancellationSource and the request to cancel is a normal top down design, with the cooperating TaskCompletionSource Task at the bottom. p  pNow, to the real problem. What to do when the application state changes Lets assume that having the Work function operate on a copy of the state is not feasible.p  pOne solution would be to listen to the state change in the task cache or there about. If the cache has a CancellationToken used by the underlying task, the one running the Work function, it could cancel it. This could then trigger a cancellation of all attached TaskCompletionSources Tasks, and thus both UI components would get Canceled tasks. This is some kind of bottom up cancellation.p  pIs there a preferred way to do this Is there a design pattern that describes it some wherep  pThe bottom up cancellation can be implemented, but it feel a bit weird. The UItask is created with a CancellationToken, but it is canceled due to another inner CancellationToken. Also, since the tokens are not the same, the OperationCancelledException cant just be ignored in the UI  that would eventually lead to an exception being thrown in the outer Tasks finalizer.p

Negative 6101 pI have a base class A and a derived class B.

Negative 6101 pIm writing a multithreaded program in C using C11 threading library.p  pI have the following requirementsp  ol liMain thread listens to some type of events, and fires off a new thread for each new eventli liWhen program termination is requested, new thread creation is blocked and we wait for the old threads to finishli ol  pI have the option to store the threads in some container, for example, a list. Before exit, all threads in the container are codejoincodeed. However, since STL containers are not threadsafe, additional synchronization is needed when adding a new thread and removing a finished thread from the container. The interaction between the main thread and the child threads becomes a little more complicated in this case. Should the child thread remove itself from the container If not, how does it let the main thread know when its time to remove etc.p  pAnother way I see is to have an atomic int which is incremented by the main thread when a child thread is created, and decremented by the child thread right before its termination threads will be codedetachcodeed after creation, so I wont have to manage any stdthread objects. Before exiting, we just wait for the atomic integer to become 0 in a simple loop. This solution looks better to me because there are less moving parts and no locking at least as long as the target platform has a lockfree implementation of codestdatomicltintgtcode. p  pSo, my question is, which of the above methods would you preferp

Negative 6101 pIm designing an API with ActiveRecord for the first time. I have a parent object that codehasmanycode child objects. The child object codebelongstocode the parent with codecountercache gt truecode.p  pCurrently the API returns a JSON structure that contains the parent with an array of emallem of its children, ordered by time.

Ideally the API would be flexible enough to be able to return, for example, child 1, 4, and 622, and JSON response would indicate these positions.p  pMy first instinct was to add a column to each child object in the database that holds an integer index. I could assign this integer at creationtime with the codecountercachecode value of the parent at the time.

Negative 6101 pIm using a hrefhttpsgithub.comdoundgaesessions relnofollowgaesessionsa. The client is an iOS application, and I want sessions to persist for the lifetime of the app so the only way a session expires or is invalid is when the user logs out or the user deletes the app, other wise the session has no expiration date. I dont think I want to use cookies, as cookies are short lived or should Ip  pSo what Im doing is creating a new session, get the automatically generated SID for that session session id, a random string, and sending that string back to the client and saving it there for good. Now every time the user sends a request, the session id is also sent over, and I get the current session using this id p  precode gets the session with given session id session  gaesessions.Sessionsid  sessionid codepre  pFirst, is anything wrong with this approach Is there a better way to do thisp  pNow, when the user logs out, its easy to submit a request to invalidate the session with the given id. However, if the user deletes the app, Ill have no way of ever getting that session and deleting it. So how would I clean up no longer valid sessionsp

Negative 6101 pI am using JavaScript and jQuery to build a pretty complex UI  it has dropdowns, buttons, elements that are jQuery plugins, etc. At the bottom of the UI, there are two buttons Ok and Cancel.

Negative 6101 pI have an existing MVC3 project using EF4 with a database first design. All entities and the edmx were generated correctly.  p  pThe problem is when I add a column to a table or make any change to my database. After making a change, I would go back to VS2010 and open my edmx file.  When I right click and select Update Model from Database it shows all my tables under Add instead of showing only the changes I have made under refresh.  I have searched everywhere to find a reason for this but to no avail.  Any help would be great.p

Negative 6101 pSo im making a sudoku game for class. Ive got a grid JPanel thats a grid of different spaces. each space on this grid is JButton that contains a Space class field and is attached to a list, and each list has a corresponding list actionlistener that changes the value of the Space depending on which selection the user makes.p  pAlso attached to this list is an actionlistener in the original JFrame that the grid JPanel is contained within. what im trying to do is have this actionlistener in the JFrame use a method to see if any of the spaces on the sudoku board are unfilled, so that if they are all filled it can do an appropriate win or lose window.p  pbut what i think is happening is that the code changing the value of the spaces in the list actionlistener hasnt executed by the time the code to look for unfilled spaces has in the JFrame actionlistner, thus resulting in a response of false from the method checking whether the game has finished.p  panyone have any thoughts on how to overcome thisp

Negative 6101 pI have been using springsecurityfacebook grails plugin in a website and it works like a charm.p  pIn fact, it works so well, that I havent had to dig too much into how it works and thats probably why I am stuck right now.p  pI have a webapp that exposes a json REST API . Authentication can be done using userpassword or by using facebook credentials, and for that Ive been using this plugin. I just need authentication and users email. Ive been using the redirect filter for this purpose FacebookAuthRedirectFilter. It works perfect in this context.p  pRight now I am trying to build a mobile application using phonegap, so my mobile app is purely html,js and css, and want to interact with the same webapp using AJAX requests.p  pThe problem arises, because in the mobile app context, the html files are local and they need to be this way,as they are bundled with the application.p  pMy question is how can I authenticate user in this casep  pIf I leave as it is, after a succesfull login the mobile app will be redirected to the webapps domain, and will stop getting the local html files, which is not what I want.p  pI suppose I need some sort of client authentication, and then send an AJAX request to my webapp adding the facebook cookie somehow, so subsequent AJAX request to the webapp are already authenticated.p  pBut I may be totally wrong and it should be done in a different way.p  pAny help will be really apreciated.p  pI can elaborate or add any clarification if is not clear, just ask.p  pemstrongEDITemstrongp  pAfter going through Igors suggestion, I have made some changes in the plugin to have the FacebookAuthDirectFilter in place to test the signedRequest approach, and also I have integrated phonegapfacebookplugin in my phonegap App.p  pI can succesfully login to facebook in the device, but I am not able to retrieve the signedRequest in the mobile side.p  pAs this thread suggests a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10928009jssdkgetloginstatusdoesntreturnuseridnorsignedrequestJS SDK getLoginStatus doesn39t return userID nor signedRequesta, it may not be possible to get the signedRequest in this case.p  pHowever, I have the userId and the accesstoken in the mobile side, which is all I need I think to get the user info. Can I authenticate a user with this info in the springsecurityfacebook grails plugin The FacebookAuthRedirectFilter uses a code I dont havep  pTheres another tweak here, because the accesstoken is different if the user connects through a common web site and if the user connects from the mobile. The plugin stores one, and I am not sure what implications it may have.p  pthanks a lotp

Negative 6101 pFirst of all I am using a clientserver architecture, android for the client and node.js for the server, they are connected through Socket.io library, so, they are using websockets.p  pThe doubt that I have is that I am generating a XML string with XMLSerializer from Java, I want to encode it to EXI and send it to a server, thus, is it possible doing the encode XMLEXI without using files directly from string to string because all examples I see assume that my XML is in a file and I want the output into another file. Another doubt is, can I just send the EXI as string because I have already established the communication between the client and the server, but they just send strings, I don not if I can sent whole files, in that case, would be any diference on the amount of data sentp

Negative 6101 pIm trying to work with a hrefhttpwww.soclib.fr relnofollowSoclibawww.soclib.fr inside the Eclipse CDT 3.8, but the code error highlighter analyser, whatever is called do not see a huge bunch of include files. The compilation is not a problem because Makefile calls a python script that deals with dependencies etc. but I want Eclipse CDT to be useful, and show me if I am doing something wrong.p  pI tried to add the root folder of all includes as a separate folder in the workbench and then add it to the right click on projectPropertiesCC GeneralPaths and Symbols as a folder from workspace. It doesnt work.  If I try to the root folder of it at the same place, it doesnt work  Eclipse doesnt treat this folder recursively, so the entry here needs to be a leaf of the tree.p  pOne way it could work is to make a pythonbash script that would go through the tree and create a list of all end leaves with .h or .hpp files, and then to import that list to Eclipse. Is there a smartereasier way to do thisp  pThanks in advancep

Negative 6101 pI have a .NET 2.0 Windows Forms application that uses an ASP.NET Web Service hosted as part of a .NET 3.5 Web site. The Web site is hosted on a Windows server running IIS7. When I run the Forms application in Visual Studio 2010, I am able to use the Web Service without a problem. However, when I build the Forms application with MSBuild 4.0, it builds and runs, but when the service is used the following exception is thrownp  precodeSystem.Web.Services.Protocols.SoapException Server was unable to read request. gt System.InvalidOperationException There is an error in XML document the line number varies. gt     System.FormatException Input string was not in a correct format. codepre  pI used MS Network monitor to view the SOAP to see where the problem was in the XML document. It would appear that at least one tag isnt being parsed correctly. For example, MS Network monitor displays one of the apparently broken tags as followsp  precode Element XmlElementltCountrygt  USAlt      STag ltCountrygt          Tag ltCountrygt              TagName Country                 Name Country     Content USAlt codepre  pAn ETag end tag isnt recognized.

Negative 6101 pI usually set each attribute of a class as final only for attributes that will be initialized within the constructor. The point is that I am now implementing a Mockup of an object for testing purpose. This Mockup extends the class that it is mocking up and this class has some final attributes. Therefore Im forced to call the super constructor within the constructor of the Mockup object. This breaks however the utility of the Mockup because I dont want it to initialize all of the attributes in the way the normal class does it. Id rather call the Mockup constructor without calling to super and doing whatever I want.p  pMy question is Is it a good practice to define attributes as final as long as they will force you to call the class constructor in the Mockupp  pEDIT I add some code. The problem in this case is that Im using a singleton, I know that this is not a good idea when testing but in this case I cannot change it. So my intention is not to call this method in the Mockup.p  precodepublic class ReportsDataManager   private final MapltString, ListltStringgtgt translations  public ReportsDataManager  this.translations  GenericUtils.getTranslation  codepre  pp

Negative 6101 pAfter reviewing multiple online references for generating Java MD5 and SHA hashes, i have noticed that the plaintext String of File undergoes certain prep before amp after it is fed to the Digest object for generating hashes. Specifically, data is first converted to bytearray, then fed to the digest, then the output hash is converted to hexadecimal stream.

Negative 6101 pI am trying to encapsulate table view behavior and am starting with connecting table view header signals to table view slots defined in the subclass. I can get the behavior Im looking for without subclassing, but that defeats the purpose. When I do try to subclass, I get the dreaded No matching function call to connect. All components are ultimately QObjects, so I dont think thats the problem. But, then again, maybe that IS the problem. Right now Im connecting to hideColumn, but I would eventually like to connect to my own slots such as mysectionClickedint.p  pThe code below was drawn from the source for C GUI Programming with Qt 4 by Jasmin Blanchette and Mark Summerfield with the exception of the MyTableView addition that I made.p  pMyTableView.hp  precodeifndef MYTABLEVIEWHPP define MYTABLEVIEWHPP  include ltQTableViewgt  class MyTableView  public QTableView      QOBJECT  public     explicit MyTableViewQWidget parent  0  public slots     void mysectionClickedint logicalIndex  private slots  public  private     QHeaderView mrowHeader    endif  MYTABLEVIEWHPP codepre  pMyTableView.cppp  precode Qt Includes include ltQDebuggt include ltQMenugt   Local Includes include MyTableView.h  MyTableViewMyTableViewQWidget parent  QTableViewparent      mrowHeader  horizontalHeader     connectmrowHeader, SIGNALsectionClickedint, this, SLOThideColumnint   void MyTableViewmysectionClickedint logicalIndex      qDebug.nospace ltlt Column  ltlt logicalIndex ltlt  selected. ltlt n  codepre  pcurrencymodel.hp  precodeifndef CURRENCYMODELH define CURRENCYMODELH  include ltQAbstractTableModelgt include ltQMapgt  class CurrencyModel  public QAbstractTableModel  public     CurrencyModelQObject parent  0      void setCurrencyMapconst QMapltQString, doublegt ampmap     int rowCountconst QModelIndex ampparent const     int columnCountconst QModelIndex ampparent const     QVariant dataconst QModelIndex ampindex, int role const     QVariant headerDataint section, QtOrientation orientation,         int role const  private     QString currencyAtint offset const      QMapltQString, doublegt currencyMap   endif codepre  pcurrencymodel.cppp  precodeinclude ltQtCoregt  include currencymodel.h  CurrencyModelCurrencyModelQObject parent      QAbstractTableModelparent    void CurrencyModelsetCurrencyMapconst QMapltQString, doublegt ampmap      currencyMap  map     reset  Forces views to refresh data    int CurrencyModelrowCountconst QModelIndex amp  parent  const      return currencyMap.count   int CurrencyModelcolumnCountconst QModelIndex amp  parent  const      return currencyMap.count   QVariant CurrencyModeldataconst QModelIndex ampindex, int role const      if index.isValid         return QVariant      if role  QtTextAlignmentRole              return intQtAlignRight  QtAlignVCenter          else if role  QtDisplayRole              QString rowCurrency  currencyAtindex.row         QString columnCurrency  currencyAtindex.column          if currencyMap.valuerowCurrency  0.0             return           double amount  currencyMap.valuecolumnCurrency                      currencyMap.valuerowCurrency          return QString1.argamount, 0, f, 4           return QVariant   QVariant CurrencyModelheaderDataint section,     QtOrientation  orientation ,     int role const      if role  QtDisplayRole         return QVariant     return currencyAtsection   QString CurrencyModelcurrencyAtint offset const      return currencyMap.begin  offset.key  codepre  pmainwindow.hp  precodeifndef MAINWINDOWH define MAINWINDOWH  include ltQMainWindowgt include ltQtGuigt  include MyTableView.h include currencymodel.h  class MainWindow  public QMainWindow      QOBJECT  public     MainWindow  protected  private slots     void onsectionClickedint locicalIndex  private     QMapltQString, doublegt currencyMap     CurrencyModel currencyModel     QTableView tableView     QHeaderView mrowHeader   endif codepre  pmainwindow.cppp  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt include mainwindow.h  MainWindowMainWindow      currencyMap.insertAUD, 1.3259     currencyMap.insertCHF, 1.2970     currencyMap.insertCZK, 24.510     currencyMap.insertDKK, 6.2168     currencyMap.insertEUR, 0.8333     currencyMap.insertGBP, 0.5661     currencyMap.insertHKD, 7.7562     currencyMap.insertJPY, 112.92     currencyMap.insertNOK, 6.5200     currencyMap.insertNZD, 1.4697     currencyMap.insertSEK, 7.8180     currencyMap.insertSGD, 1.6901     currencyMap.insertUSD, 1.0000      currencyModel.setCurrencyMapcurrencyMap           THIS WORKS      mrowHeader  tableView.horizontalHeader     connectmrowHeader, SIGNALsectionClickedint,         amptableView, SLOThideColumnint           tableView.setModelampcurrencyModel     tableView.setAlternatingRowColorstrue      tableView.setWindowTitleQObjecttrCurrencies     tableView.show   void MainWindowonsectionClickedint logicalIndex      qDebug.nospace ltlt Column  ltlt logicalIndex ltlt  selected. ltlt n  codepre  pmain.cppp  precodeinclude mainwindow.h  int mainint argc, char argv[]      QApplication appargc, argv     MainWindow mainWin     return app.exec  codepre  pThe error I get isp  precodeg c pipe O2 Wall W DREENTRANT DQTNODEBUG DQTGUILIB DQTCORELIB DQTSHARED IoptQtSDKDesktopQt4.8.1gccmkspecsdefault I.

Negative 6101 pSome months ago, I asked a question about making a splash screen with longrunning code on monotouch.p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions14621022splashscreenwithheavycodesinmonotouchSplash screen with heavy codes in monotouchap  pI followed the answer. Now the question is, when I use codeModalViewControllercode how can I close the app in a normal way when the longrunning operation failsp  pFor example, my longrunning code is downloading some configs from server. Then, the download fails. I show a codeUIAlertViewcode to the user that reads, Download failed, continue. When user taps Yes, the app continues, but what about No What should I do p  pI believe that the best option is closing the app, but I found that it is not recommended and the app may be rejected during the app approval process. So, I just hide the AlertView and ask the user to press the Home Button to close the app. However, when user starts the app again, the application is not starting from coderootcode, rather it is just resuming from the previous state.p

Negative 6101 pI recently setup a Magento store which draws products from various external feeds  most we have no control over. Ive run into a problem in that our customers are searching our site using queries without hyphens and our products description both SKU and title contain one or more. You would think that Magento could handle such an issue but unfortunately no results show.p  pIve been into fulltext.php, where I believe a solution would probably begin, but have been unable to figure this out. In addition, I also attempted to fix the opposite issue where the product description had no hyphen but the search query did but the following code failed to do anything when added to the top of function prepareResult.p  precodequeryText  strreplace, ,trimqueryText codepre
Negative 6101 pOk so I have my main div, inside that one I have another div and inside that one I have another div. What Im trying to do is get the last div to float outside of both of its parents, its a badge that I want to have sticking out of the main div.

Negative 6101 pI am relatively new to Android and working with an online API. I have two activities. The first activity is bringing up a list of search results and placing them into a ListView. This is not a problem. I am trying to select an item from this ListView and pass it to the next activity and fill another ListView in this new activity with information from the selected item. This is where the problem is. The second activity never loads. What is a good way to get the second activity to work I have been doing research and not getting the desired results. The code for the two activities and helper class are below.

Negative 6101 pIm working on a .Net 4.0 web project that uses Microsoft RDLC Reporting framework with a local processing mode and my problem is I have to sort the tabular data with a dynamic column names string array parameter so when i researched on the internetsorry i dont have the actual links for the research with me now I found that I have this options.p  ol liUse interactive sorting  which I cant use bc the sorting columns are not predefined and I have more columns that are not visibleno header or column but still participate on sorting.li liUse Sorting tab on the tablix properties  This is an ideal solution to my problem but now Im stuck on an issue. li ol  pI found on the internet that one can specify sorting fields in two ways on the sorting tab of tablix properties. p  ul lipThe First way is to Concatenate Fields using amp on the first sorting fields using expression like this FieldsTitle.Value amp FieldsEstimatedHours.Value This one will sort the data but it sorts Numbers as Strings meaning when you sort in an ascending order 250.00 will be always on the top of 3.6 I didnt Test it on other data types like Date and so on but Im sure it will result in the same thing.pli lipThe Second way that I found was to add a sort field expression textbox for every sort fields that I have on the Sort tab of Tablix Properties window like this.pli liOn First Text Box   FieldsTitle.Valueli liOn Second Text Box   FieldsEstimatedHours.Valueli ul  pOn this way it will only sort the data on the first field that I gave it in the first textbox and it forget about the rest of the fields.p  pSo my question is what am I missing here to make the above sorting workp  pThank you everybody in advance, and I hope I will fix the issue with your help.

Negative 6101 pI have some questions about memory layout of C programs.p  h2Text Segmenth2  pHere is my first questionp  pWhen I searched the text segment or code segment I read that Text segment contain executable instructions. ut what are executable instructions for any function Could you give some different examplesp  pI also read that Text segment is sharable so that only a single copy needs to be in memory for frequently executed programs such as text editors, the C compiler, etc., but I couldnt make a connection between C programs and text editors.p  pWhat should I understand from this statementp  h2Initialized Data Segmenth2  pIt is said that the Initialized Data Segment contains the global variables and static variables, but I also read that codeconst char string  hello worldcode makes the string literal hello world to be stored in initialized readonly area and the character pointer variable string in initialized readwrite area. codechar stringcode is stored readonly area or readwrite area Since both are written here Im a bit confused.p  h2Stackh2  pFrom what I understand, the stack contains the local variables. Is this rightp
Negative 6101 pIm trying to place a series of images on my website, and I want them to flow side by side and automatically wrap to the width of the container div. I made a separate div for each image, because I also need text to stay with each image. However, my image divs are stacking as if there were a hard return between each one, though there isnt, rather than flowing.  p  pIve been searching for the answer, and everything Ive read says that the default positioning for a div is static, which means flow will be automatic.

Negative 6101 pIm currently in the database design stage of developing a new section of our product. For which I need to have a sanity check or some advice because I do not feel overly confident about some parts of the setup.p  h1A bit of background infoh1  pThe product we are developing is a so called marketing ROI maximization system. It handles big data and processesenhancesenriches vast amount of information before sending it to different marketing channels. Thats basicly what it does in a nutshell. p  h1The problem domainh1  pThe system currently does not fully feature good validation of data and is being abused on a daily basis by marketing people and what we call selfservice customers. With the new google Product Listing Ads network in mind of our CEO, I was given the task to come up with a good solution on how to handle informationdata for use in the shopping channel of google call it PLA product listing ads.p  pstrongThis is the problemstrongbr Our product does not offer any form of validationread adhering to the network specific requirements and PLA basically completely revolves around dataintegrity by the means of Categorization of items each category has defined requiredoptional fields and each field can or should be in a specific format might even depend on linked category I dont know yet P.p  pYou guess it, were kinda screwed with the current setup. Its just not possible to enforce these kinds of strict product feeds. By letting our marketing people and selfservice customers create and send data to PLA will mean bughuntingproblem solving 99 of the time. And since its just a small company, id rather look at the real problem. That means trying to create a real validation system which can be used for PLA marketing campaigns.p  h1What needs to be doneh1  pI have been talking to our marketing people and customers to know what the use cases are and what would be the requirements. These can be summed up in the following list itemsp  ul liEach item in the input feed needs to be  mapped categorisized to a google PLA category See links section to see which categories can be mapped to.li liValidation needs to be setup per field per categoryli liEach field per item needs to allocatedmapped to a field defined in the selected category.li ul  h1Additional side infoh1  pNow, I dont want to worry about things like How are we gonna link items to a category or fields to category field definitions or anything like that. These dynamic things will be handled by a ECA rule system, which will be developed some other time. why you ask The system is handlingprocessing data on a scheduled basis so each operation needs to be defined and stored for later use, dont worry about implementation details for now.p  pAlso, the concrete specific implementation is often realized by the use of dynamic attributes for example, the attributes on a field as defined by the datatype etc. An EAV system is also not my main focus right now. the use case given above will make more sense if you take a look at the database design. p  h1My current designh1  pFirstly, let me explain my SQL structure using the main entitiesp  ul licodeschemascode an abstract way of defining categories, think of a PLA categoryli licodefieldscode field definitions in a codeschemacodeli licodedatatypescode a bag of types. mainly used for giving above fields some data integrityli licodevalueConstraintscode a bag of constraint definitions not the implementation. li ul  pNow. Its all good and dandy so far. Heres the thing Im kinda worried aboutp  pcodevalueConstraintscode are bound to a datatype by the means of a NM table codedatatypevalueConstraintscode but almost every user generated datatype is being composed of only a subset of the available valueconstraints, it doesnt make sense to have a Price datatype which can have a Email constraint.. however, it does make sense to have a Min and Max constraint seeing a price is always a number. For clarity codedatatypevalueConstraintscode is holding the possible codevalueConstraintscode per datatype.p  pThe same problem occurs with primitiveType  constraintValue relationships. Basicly an datatype must include a primitiveType in my case a foreign key to the primitive type table. A primitive type manages the codevalueConstraintscode to select from. codeprimitiveTypescode and codevalueConstraintscode are not considered user generated, so its fixture data for now.p  pDont get it Heres an example workflow partial setup for PLAclothing schemap  ul liAdd datatype image, set primitive type to TEXT ul liSelect the following codeValueConstraintscode to use TEXT specific ul liURL make sure its httphttps or something like that, dunnoli liMinLength make sure its thereli liRegex allow for certain image extensions.. or something like thatli ulli ulli liAdd field definition imageURL, set datatype to image ul lidatatype specific configuration, i.e. filling in constraint assertion data EAV pattern related. MinLength  14, Regex  gifjpgpng etcetera.li ulli ul  pBecause the datatype was of primitive TEXT the user could select from only TEXTconcerning and inherited due to tree like datatyping system codevalueConstraintscode.p  pOnce the datatype was properly setup, we can use datatype image for multiple fields in the schema if we would want. For example a PLACLOTHING schema might need an additional image field. This is now perfectly possible by reusing the image datatype with maybe a different constraint configuration.p  pA visual SQL table layout showing relationships brainwave regarding above wall of textp  pMy DB schema click to enlargep  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comc7jtq.pngimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comc7jtq.png altap  h1TLDRh1  pSee My current design and give me your opinion.

Negative 6101 pon click, the div should move up and be mostly hidden, and then on click again, move back down to original position. Yea.... its so not doing that.

Negative 6101 pIs there a quick way to clear the menu bar i.e. Remove all menus in PyQt.p  pThe reason I ask is that I am developing a modular application. Each module provides its own menus and gives a weighting to where that menu should appear. Each module can also add a menuAction to another modules menu, however when that happens it changes the order of the menus. What i want to do is when the menus have finished being created is to remove them all and then re add them.p  pI know this will work because I can re add them now and they appear in the correct order but all the previous menus are still there.p

Negative 6101 pThis is sort of like LibGDX. It has an Application interface and an ApplicationListener interface. The methods create, render, pause, resume, and dispose are somehow magically executed at least to me it seems that way without being called anywhere. How is this possible Did I miss something I have a basic knowledge of Java, but maybe I missed something.p  pThe source can be viewed here at a hrefhttpsgithub.comlibgdxlibgdxtreemastergdxsrccombadlogicgdx relnofollowhttpsgithub.comlibgdxlibgdxtreemastergdxsrccombadlogicgdxap
Negative 6101 pIm making a 2D batch renderer in OpenGL inspired by the XNAMonoGame interface, but Ive run into a small design problem and Im looking for some input. Currently, you can submit vertex data in four general waysp  precodevoid Renderconst Spriteamp sprite void Renderconst Shapeamp shape void Renderconst Vertex vertices, unsigned int length void Renderconst Vertex vertices, unsigned int length, const Texture texture codepre  pA sprite contains four vertices, color and texture coordinates while the other three can contain an arbitrary number the sprite and shape have unique transformations. Everything can be textured or untextured. I want to batch everything to reduce the number of state changes and OpenGL draw calls. I feel it reasonable to assume that most submissions will have shared vertices so that I can use glDrawElements instead of glDrawArrays, but I have trouble figuring out how to batch things properly given what I described above.p  pThe XNAMonoGame sprite batchers work because they work solely with textured quadstriangles and not arbitrary shapes. Alternatively, I could do like the SFML renderer and issue a draw call for each drawable object, but that defeats the purpose of batch rendering.p  pI feel like my renderer is trying to do everything which is something I want to avoid since it usually quickly becomes too complex in my experience.p  pWhat Im asking is How could I redesign my renderer Could I keep separate batch lists for different submissions Could I modularize my renderer somehow Should I just allow only textured objects as done in XNAMonoGamep

Negative 6101 pIm an experienced C programmer, but a complete python newbie. Im learning python mostly for fun, and as a first exercise want to parse a text file, extracting the meaningful bits from the fluff, and ending up with a tabdelimited string of those bits in a different order.p  pIve had a blast plowing through tutorials and documentation and stackoverflow QampAs, merrily splitting strings and reading lines from files and etc. Now I think Im at the point where I need a few road signs from experienced folks to avoid blind alleys.p  pHeres one chunk of the text I want to parse you may recognize this as a McMaster order. The actual file will contain one or more chunks like this.p  precode1   92351A603   Lag Screw for Wood, 188 Stainless Steel, 516 Diameter, 5 Long, packs of 5 Your Part Number 7218GYROID 22 packs   today 5.85 per pack     128.70 codepre  pNote that the information is split over several lines in the file. Id like to end up with a tabdelimited string that looks like thisp  precode22tpackstLag Screw for Wood, 188 Stainless Steel, 516 Diameter, 5 Long, packs of 5tt92351A603t5.85tt128.70t7218GYROIDn codepre  pSo I need to extract some parts of the string while ignoring others, rearrange them a bit, and repack them into a string.p  pHeres the very early code I have at the moment, it reads the file a line at a time, splits each line with delimiters, and I end up with several lists of strings, including a bunch of empty ones where there were double tabsp  precodeimport sys import string  def splitdelimiters, string, maxsplit0     Split the given string with the given delimiters an array of strings     This function lifted from stackoverflow in a post by Kos     import re     regexPattern  .joinmapre.escape, delimiters     return re.splitregexPattern, string, maxsplit  delimiters  t, n, r, Your Part Number  with opensys.argv[1], r as f     for line in f         printsplit delimiters, line  f.close codepre  pQuestion 1 is basic how can I remove the empty strings from my lists, then mash all the strings together into one list In C Id loop through all the lists, ignoring the empties and sticking the other strings in a new list. But I have a feeling python has a more elegant way to do this sort of thing.p  pQuestion 2 is more open ended whats a robust strategy here Should I read more than one line at a time in the first place Make a dictionary, allowing easier reordering of the items later p  pSorry for the novel. Thanks for any pointers. And please, stylistic comments are more than welcome, style matters.p
Negative 6101 pI am building a Tic Tac Toe game in java. I have gotten the game to a stage where I can display the title, a reset button, the grid and draw the Xs and Os when the player clicks in the grid the game currently has no game logic as I will add later. My problem at the moment, is that each time the player clicks on the  grid, any Xs will change to Os and the Os to Xs. I think the problem is within the paint method of the TicTacToeGame.java, but I cant work it out as I am still learning. If someone could offer some advice, it would greatly be appreciated.

Negative 6101 pOK, this question sounds simple but I am taken by surprise. In the ancient days when 1 Megabyte was a huge amount of memory, Intel was trying to figure out how to use 16 bits to access 1 Megabyte of memory. They came up with the idea of using segment and offset address values to generate a 20 bit address. p  pNow, 20 bits gives 220  1,048,576 locations that can be addressed. Now assuming that we access 1 byte per address location we get 1,048,57610241024  220220 Megabytes  1 Megabyte. Ok understood.p  pThe confusion comes here, we have 16 bit data bus in the ancient 8086 and can access 2 bytes at a time rather than 1, this equate 20 bit address to being able to access a total of 2 Megabyte of data right Why do we assume that each address only has 1 byte stored in it when the data bus is 2 bytes wide I am confused here.p

Negative 6101 pWere doing a lot of work around dynamic directives in our Angular project, and one thing that came up as a nicetohave was a way to have a generic directive that can list many different types of similar objects e.g., messages, users, comments, etc., by delegating to specific directives based on the objects types.p  pWe call this directive, codeobjectlistcode and it will hopefully delegate to a number of different directives, if we can get it working properly.p  pThe main issue we need to tackle is whether or not a directive that this codeobjectlistcode directive has been provided exists in our system. The way weve been checking this is by issuing a codecompilecode against the target directive, linking it to a scope, and checking its HTML contents e.g., codevar tmpElement  compileltdiv mymessagegtltdivgtscopecode. This seems to work when the template for the target directive is referenced by the codetemplatecode option, but when we instead try to point to a codetemplateUrlcode, the HTML contents are empty.p  pHeres a Plunker, with the codetemplateUrlcode approach in place not working.

The default behavior is to not allow a user to login until accountLocked  false.  If you register then come back later to login, an account locked error is shown on the login form.p  pI would like to allow the user to login even if accountLocked is true meaning they have not clicked the verify link in the confirmation email.  How can I do this without adding my own myAccountLocked fieldp  pI want to be able to control some of the users account activity based on accountLocked, but they should still be able to login to access parts of their account prior to clicking the verification link in the email.p  pThe one change I did make to the default install is I create the user during the registration process, not in the verification process.

Negative 6101 pIm coming up with a rather trivial problem, but since Im quite new to python, Im smashing my head to my desk for a while. Hurts. Though I believe thats more a logical thing to solve... First I have to say that Im using the Python SDK for Cinema 4D so I had to change the following code a bit. But here is what I was trying to do and struggling with Im trying to group some polygon selections, which are dynamically generated based on some rules, not that important. Heres how it works the mathematical way  Those selections are based on islands means, that there are several polygons connected. Then, those selections have to be grouped and put into a list that I can work with. Any polygon has its own index, so this one should be rather simple, but like I said before, Im quite struggling there.p  pThe main problem is easy to explain Im trying to access a non existent index in the first loop, resulting in an index out of range error. I tried evaluating the validity first, but no luck. For those who are familiar with Cinema 4D  Python, I will provide some of the original code if anybody wants that. So far, so bad. Heres the simplified and adapted code.p  pedit Forgot to mention that the check which causes the error actually should only check for duplicates, so the current selected number will be skipped since it hal already been processed. This is necessary due to computingheavy calculations.p  pReally hope, anybody can bump me in the right direction and this code makes sense so far. p  pre classlangpython prettyprintoverridecodedef myFunc          sel  [0,1,5,12]  changes with every call of myFunc, for example to [2,8,4,10,9,1], etc.  list alway differs in count of elements, can even be empty, groups are beeing built from these values         all  [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15]  the whole set         groups  []  list to store indiceslists into         indices  []  list to store selected indices         count  0  number of groups         tmp  []  temporary list to copy the indices list into before resetting          for i in rangelenall  loop through values             if i not in groups[count]  thats the problematic one this one actually should check whether i is already inside of any list inside the group list, error is simply that Im trying to check a non existent value                 for index, selected in enumeratesel  loop through sel and return actual indices. selected determines, if index is selected. boolean.                     if not selected continue  pretty much selfexplanatory                     indices.appendindex  push selected indices to the list                 tmp  indices[]  clone list                 groups.appendtmp  push the previous generated list to another list to store groups into                 indices  []  emptyreset indiceslist                 count  1  increment count         print groups     debug myFunc codepre  pstrongeditstrongp  pAfter adding a second list which will be filled by codeextendcode, not codeappendcode that acts as counter, everything worked as expected The list will be a basic list, pretty simple p

Negative 6101 pIm optimizing my code. In my app if you want to add a category an alert view pops up and asks you to enter a new category name. If I created this alert view only after clicking that add button, the popup was delayed. So I wanted to preload this alert view into a property which can displayed then each time if someone clicks the add button. Of course I want to do this asynchronous, but also be safe if somehow a user clicks too early the add button and the alert view isnt yet created, that the job still gets done with lazy instantiation.

Negative 6101 pSuppose you maintain a library that exposes a function codegetDatacode. Your users call it to get actual databr codevar output  getDatacodebr Under the hood data is saved in a file so you implemented codegetDatacode using Node.js builtin codefs.readFileSynccode. Its obvious both codegetDatacode and codefs.readFileSynccode are sync functions. One day you were told to switch the underlying data source to a repo such as MongoDB which can only be accessed asynchronously. You were also told to avoid pissing off your users, codegetDatacode API cannot be changed to return merely a promise or demand a callback parameter. How do you meet both requirementsp  pAsynchronous function using callbackpromise is the DNA of JavasSript and Node.js. Any nontrivial JS app is probably permeated with this coding style. But this practice can easily lead to so called callback pyramid of doom. Even worse, if any code in any caller in the call chain depends on the result of the async function, those code has to be wrapped in callback function as well, imposing a coding style constraint on caller. From time to time I find the need to encapsulate an async function often provided in a 3rd party library into a sync function in order to avoid massive global refactoring. Searching for a solution on this subject usually ended up with a hrefhttpsgithub.comlaverdetnodefibersNode Fibersa or npm packages derived from it. But Fibers just cannot solve the problem I am facing. Even the example provided by Fibers author illustrated the deficiencyp  precode...

Negative 6101 pI have been thinking of different approaches to achieve asynchronous processing in Java. I thought of a few possibilities and wanted to get your opinion on whether some of them are better than other, and maybe get further suggestions on how this can be done. The most common usecase that comes to mind is sending packets of data over a connection e.g. TCP with the following API codevoid sendDataData datacode or even codevoid sendDataData data, Handler handlercode. Here are a few ideas I hadp  ol liDedicated Data sending loop  have a didicated thread, that behaves a bit like Event Dispatch Thread in Java, that all other threads call and submit a request. These requests are stored in a queue and periodically that queu is drained and all requests are sent.li liUse background thread to drain the queue  the Connection could maintain the list of pending requests, and have a background thread to drain the queue with some synchronizationli liExecutor service  pass the request to the service and call the Handler from the background thread.li liAsynchronous channel  most highlevel approach, delegate over to the implementationli ol  pIs any of those better to use, or if you have  any other general ideas in mind, please share your comments.p

Negative 6101 pIm new in the area of Fortran programming and after testing a few programs I already got a feeling of how to write programs. Now I was trying me on a bit harder program and I run into a problem I couldnt solve by myself. I already googled about the problem but I couldnt find an adequate answer ... So I thought maybe there are one or two Fortran programmers which can give me a hand in solving this problem.p  pThe program is very simple it just multiplies two matrices with each other. I was trying to write a function which performs the task and returns the result matrix back to the invoker. To make the program a bit more dynamic I used dynamic arrays where the user can specify the dimension the matrices should have. The program looks like thisp  precodeprogram matrixMul implicit none integer, parameter  ikindselectedintkind18 integerkindikind, allocatable, dimension,  m1, m2, result, mulMatrix integer  rows, cols, i, j  print , Please enter the number of rows the matrix should have  read , rows  print , Please enter the number of columns the matrix should have  read , cols  allocate sufficient memory allocatem1rows, cols, m2cols, rows  fill matrixes with numbers entered by the user call fillMatrixm1, rows, cols call fillMatrixm2, cols, rows  result  mulMatrixm1, m2, rows, cols  prints the result matrix to the screen call printMatrixresult, rows, cols  deallocate memory deallocatem1, m2, mulMatrix, result end program matrixMul codepre  pWhere the function which performs the actual multiplication looks like thisp  precodefunction mulMatrixm1, m2, r, c resultmulMat implicit none integer, parameter  ikindselectedintkind18 integerkindikind, dimensionr, c  m1 integerkindikind, dimensionc, r  m2 integerkindikind, allocatable, dimension,  mulMat integer r, c, i, j, k  allocatemulMatr,r  code which performs calculation is omitted  end function mulMatrix codepre  pMy compiler reports the following errorp  blockquote   pError Array index at 1 is an array of rank 2p blockquote  pFor me it seems as the compiler would treat the variable mulMatrix as an usual array and therefore complains about it because I use it as it would have four dimensions which isnt the case. But how can I make the compiler think of this variable as a function call with four parameters instead of an array access Any help would be appreciate.p

Negative 6101 pstrongThe Basicsstrongp  pCreated a program to test multithreaded and singlethreaded Heap implementation in C. The program builds and processes its heaps based upon a global data structure consisting of a STL vector 28 STL vectors of 220 unsigned integers comprised of somewhat random numbers. p  pThe primary data structure initializes correctly and my program is currently split into two testing phases, one of which calls the function to perform the algorithm in a sequential manner, dumping the results into a global array which is same size as there are subvectors in the above data structure28 and where each element in this array designates the result for the subvector at that same index in the main vector of vectors. p  pThe second phase does the exact same, but in parallel, using multiple pThreads to process groups of subvectors in parallel from the main vector. The second phases dumps its results in a separate array from the first which the two result arrays are used for comparison and correctionchecking purposes.p  pSo the main data structure, the vectors of vectors is only read from by both phases of the program. Each phases writes to a different global array but at indexes that designate different elements in that array.p  pThe algorithm builds a heap out of each subvector and does a series of updatekey operations on the elements in that subvector in a sequential manner until it has exhausted all elements in the subvector. The first phase performs this by processing each subvector in a sequential manner, the second does this by processing groups of subvectors in parallel.p  pThe problem is, when I execute the program on the Windows machine under Cygwin64, the program executes correctly. No errors, correct results, everything works completely fine. Even testing with smaller datasets shown that the algorithm was being executed correctly.p  pstrongThe Problemstrongp  pBelow is the Cygwin64 execution of the program.p  precodeDValue 64 List Set Size 256 SubList Size 1048576 KValue 104857 DHeap Offset 63 AdHeap Offset 63   Number Of POSIX Threads 4  Initializing the list of sublists to be be processed.

POSIX Threaded CPU WallClock Time 12.7866s POSIX Threaded CPU Processor Time 50.202s  The results are correct codepre  pEverything works fine, even if I reduce the number of POSIX threads by input, or change the size of the data structure, it works fine. If I reduce the size of the data structure enough that I can check the resultsfor example, 256 subvectors of 256 elements, I can see that the results that the algorithm is returning is correct. So the algorithm should be performing correctly.p  pIf I execute the same program on any Linux machinep  precodeDValue 64 List Set Size 256 SubList Size 1048576 KValue 104857 DHeap Offset 63 AdHeap Offset 63   Number Of POSIX Threads 4  Initializing the list of sublists to be be processed.

This is function which essentially performs the algorithm by building the heap, performing the sequence of updatekey operations on the heap from the subvectors.

The return value is simply the root of the heap.

Negative 6101 pI am having a requirement to include a repeating TextArea controlI created small jquery snippet, that will clone the 1st textarea and append it to ul on hitting a button and therefore I am calling it as repeating text area control inside a repeating DIV section users will be presented with another add button and when that button is clicked it should clone the div and add that div to the main container. Users can hit the button as many times as they want and therefore I am calling it as repeating DIV.  p  pI am not getting any idea of getting this task done. Here is the elaborated requirement. Its similar to Repeating Field inside a Repeating Section in InfoPathp  pUsing Jquery I created a repeating textarea controls TextAreas get added as list items on hitting Add button and now I will be having a div which will need to have some textboxes and also need to include this repeating textarea field. IDs also need to unique for everything. As I mentioned above, there will be a button after that div and when the user hits that button, the entire div needs to be cloned and needs to be appended to the main container.p

I have no idea how to do this though. except for opening the savefiledialog      p
Negative 6101 pI am trying to store a highscore in a txt doc and then read it to show it on screen.

Here is the codep  precodescore  10 highscoreFile  openHighscore.txt, r HS  highscoreFile.read the HS is, lets say, 3 highscoreFile.close print Your score is, score print The HighScore is, HS if score gt HS     print newHS     newHS  True     highscoreFile  openHighscore.txt, w     highscoreFile.writes score     highscoreFile.close codepre  pNOTE if I put lt instead for the If statement, it returns True... please explain.p
Negative 6101 pI have an API spec that readsp  pstrongEncryption Algorithmstrongp  pThe API utilizes the AES128 also known as Rijndael128 algorithm with a 192bit key in  CBC mode for encryption and decryption of sensitive pieces of information  the password parameter in the usersignin and usersignup methods, the authentication token, etc. The steps of the algorithm are listed belowp  pstrongEncryptionstrongp  ul lipPad the input data so that its size is a multiple of the encryption algorithm block size  16 bytes. In case the length of input data is a multiple of 16, a block of additional 16 bytes needs to be appended. The value of each pad byte is the number of pad bytes as an unsigned char. That is, the last byte of the padded data should always be between 0x01 and 0x10.pli lipGenerate a 16byte long initialization vector IV for the encryption algorithm.pli lipEncrypt the padded data using AES128 with the EK and the generated IV.pli lipCombine the IV with the encrypted data.pli lipEncode the result with urlsafe Base64. The urlsafe Base46 alphabet uses  instead of  and  instead of .pli ul  pstrongDecryptionstrongp  ul lipBase64decode the input data.pli lipExtract the first 16 bytes  these are the IV for the AES algorithm.pli lipDecrypt the data using AES128 with the EK and IV.pli lipRead the value of the last byte of the decrypted data and remove that many bytes off its tail.pli ul  hr  pThe only example provided by the supplier of this API is in PHP, using mcrypt.  I know absolutely nothing about PHP, and am not an encryption expert.  I need to be able to represent the above algorithm using ColdFusion 10.p  pI started by trying to take the example PHP files and find equivalents in either the ColdFusion tag or function library, and then by looking for a Java library with the same interface.  I just dont know enough to make this happen.p  pIs there someone here that can point me in the right direction, or work with me offline to assistp  pEDITp  pHeres the example given, for the basic task of doing a check on the keys partner key and encryption key provided to me for use with the API.p  pObject Client.php, has this constructorp  precodepublic function constructhostApiUrl, partnerKey, encryptionKey, token  null      thisgtpk  partnerKey     thisgtek  encryptionKey     thisgtcrypt  new CryptencryptionKey     thisgturl  rtrimhostApiUrl,  . selfBASEURL     if token          thisgtsetUserSessiontoken       codepre  pand this is the function Im attempting to usep  precodepublic function checkKeys      secret  thisgtencodeParamthisgtek     result  thisgtcallpartnercheckkeys, array         secret gt secret          if result  thisgtisCodeOkresultgtcode          return false          return true  codepre  pSo the client object already has the partner key and encryption key when this method is called, obviously.p  pso the secret is created by encoding the encryption key provided, using encodeParam method.  that looks like thisp  precodeprotected function encodeParamsecret      secret  secretthisgtpk     return thisgtcryptgtencryptsecret  codepre  pso the secret is appended with the partner key.  and then encrypted using this method in the crypt object AESBLOCKSIZE is set as 16p  precodepublic function encryptdata      pad  selfAESBLOCKSIZE  strlendata  selfAESBLOCKSIZE     data . strrepeatchrpad, pad     if stristrPHPOS, win  false          randomsource  MCRYPTRAND      else          randomsource  MCRYPTDEVURANDOM          iv  mcryptcreateivselfAESBLOCKSIZE, randomsource     mcryptgenericinitthisgttd, thisgtkey, iv     data  iv . mcryptgenericthisgttd, data     mcryptgenericdeinitthisgttd      return selfurlsafeb64encodedata  codepre  pthis is returned back to the above checkKeys function which sends the request to the API, which then returns a response.  That actual API call is a POST which is easy enough to generate of course, but all those encryption hoops, including the MCRYPT library calls, are where I get stuck trying to determine the equivalent in CF10 or Java.p  pIf I were to get an example thus far, I think Id stand a chance of replicating the other functions in the crypt object the ones that are even necessary, which may not be, since some may be built right into the CF encrypt and decrypt functions. This seems like a reasonable starting point, however.p

Negative 6101 pI have entities with validation annotations such as NotNull. I dont know how to prevent a container managed transaction from rolling back in the case of a ConstraintViolationException in a bulk persist operation such asp  precodepublic void persistAllListltTheEntitygt entities throws Exception  forTheEntity ent  entities  em.persistent     codepre  pWrapping the persist operation in a trycatch would not solve the issue because even by catching the Constraint exception, the transaction would be flagged for rollback none of the other validated entities would be persisted. I could isolate the transaction per entity to persist, but I think this will impact a lot on performance not sure about this, Im using eclipselink with batch JDBC optimization.p  pI know that the behavior of the ContraintValidationException is working as the JPA spec mandates flagging rollback, but Im not sure if Im understanding how the eclipselink batch optimization works does the bulk opeations need to be in a single transaction.p  pThanks for the interest.p  pRegards.p  pEDIT Welp, eclipelink docs state that Batch writing can improve database performance by sending groups of INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements to the database in a single transaction, rather than individually., so yes, it needs to be done in a single transaction.p  pEDIT I could also inject a constraint validator from the context and disable the JPA validator on persistence.xml, so I can validate the entity list prior the JPA PrePersist operation. However, this will affect other entities that wont need bulk operations on them but still need validation. Ahh almost there.p

Negative 6101 pI would like to construct a buffer corridor around a polyline. However, I cannot use the builtin buffering functions, because the width of that buffer will not be constant. The thing is, that for every vertex point of my polyline, there is a different buffer width attributed. To make this more graphic and understandable, I include a picture of what I would like to achievep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comHhEHD.png altenter image description herep  pIn other words, at every point, we can imagine a line perpendicular to the next segment, and on this line we have two points, each at a distance emwem from the point where emwem is the width assigned to that particular point. All these points are then connected, and we obtain a corridor. p  pI hope this is clear enough. Now, I know, that I could simply calculate a perpendicular line for every consecutive point, then mark the resulting corridor points and connect them, but that seems rather computationally complex. I was wondering, if there are some smarter methods of doing that, someone must have already done something similar. Id like to hear what you have to say. Thanksp

I got really stuck so I found a solution but I am confused by the purpose of one line and confused completely by what the final return statement is doing. Thanks for your helpp  precodepublic boolean splitArrayint[] nums   return splitArrayHelpernums, 0, new int[nums.length], 0, 0, new int[nums.length], 0, 0     private boolean splitArrayHelperint[] nums, int n, int[] split1, int s1, int t1, int[] split2, int s2, int t2    if n  nums.length   return t1  t2 returns true or false  split2[s2]  split1[s1]  nums[n]  What is the purpose of this line  return  splitArrayHelpernums, n  1, split1, s1  1, t1  nums[n], split2, s2, t2   splitArrayHelpernums, n  1, split1, s1, t1, split2, s2  1, t2  nums[n]   I dont know what this return statement is doing.

However, this page here a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comtoolsprojectstemplates.html relnofollowhttpdeveloper.android.comtoolsprojectstemplates.htmla only has instructions on how to do it in Eclipse.  How can I use templates manuallyfrom the command line without using Eclipse  Ive looked online and there doesnt seem to be much information about it.  Using Android h create project, I saw that there is a g flag used for gradletemplates but I dont think thats the same as what Im looking for and even if it was Im not sure how to correctly use that flag.  Is using templates just not a feature the command line tools have  Any help would be nice, thanks.p

But what I really want to do is create a loop that keeps acting on the array. That is, Id want temparr to be sent back in as a parameter to temparray.p  pThe problem is, when I retrieve the changed array, I only have the pointer, and I cant send the pointer back into this function because my matrixstuff function needs to act on a 2d array. p  pSo the error I end up getting is p  precodeISO C forbids comparison between pointer and integer [fpermissive] codepre  pBasically Id like a way to either return an actual 2d array from a function that uses a 2d array doubtful, given other posts Ive seen, or some advice on how to create a function that just takes a pointer to a 2d array and iterates through the addresses that the pointer points to in order to recreate a copy of the original array.

Negative 6101 pI would like to retrieve district values for a field from a collection in my database. The codedistinctcode command is the obvious solution. The problem is that some fields have a large number of possible values and are not simple primitive values i.e. are complex subdocuments instead of just a string. This means the results are large causing it to overload the client I am delivering the results to.p  pThe obvious solution is to paginate the resulting distinct values. But I cannot find a good way to optimally do this. Since codedistinctcode doesnt have pagination options limit, skip, etc I am turning to the aggregation framework. My basic pipeline isp  precode[   match ... the documents I am interested in ...,   group id myfield,   sort id 1,   limit 10, ] codepre  pThis gives me the first 10 unique values for codemyfieldcode. To get the next page a skip operator is added to the pipeline. Sop  precode[   match ... the documents I am interested in ...,   group id myfield,   sort id 1,   skip 10,   limit 10, ] codepre  pBut sometimes the field I am collecting unique values from is an array. This means I have to unwind it before grouping. Sop  precode[   match ... the documents I am interested in ...,   unwind myfield   group id myfield,   sort id 1,   skip 10,   limit 10, ] codepre  pOther times the field I am getting unique values for may not be an array but its parent node might be an array. Sop  precode[   match ... the documents I am interested in ...,   unwind list   group id list.myfield,   sort id 1,   skip 10,   limit 10, ] codepre  pFinally sometimes I also need to filter on data inside the field I am getting distinct values. This means I sometimes need another match operator after the unwindp  precode[   match ... the documents I am interested in ...,   unwind list   match ... filter within list.myfield ...,   group id list.myfield,   sort id 1,   skip 10,   limit 10, ] codepre  pThe above are all simplifications of my actual data. Here is a real pipeline from the applicationp  precode[   match      sourcenamefmls,     data.surroundings.school.nearby.district.id 1300120,     compiledatexiststrue,     data.status.currentneSold   ,   unwinddata.surroundings.school.nearby,   match       sourcenamefmls,     data.surroundings.school.nearby.district.id1300120,     compiledatexiststrue,     data.status.currentneSold   ,   groupiddata.surroundings.school.nearby,   sortid1,   skip10,   limit10 ] codepre  pI hand the same codematchcode document to both the initial filter and the filter after the unwind because the codematchcode document is somewhat opaque from a 3rd party so I dont really know which parts of the query are filtering outside my unwind vs inside the data I am getting distinct values for.p  pIs there any obvious different way to go about this. In general, my strategy is working but there are some queries where it is taking 1015 seconds to return the results. There are about 200,000 documents in the collection although only about 60,000 after the first codematchcode in the pipeline is applied which can use indexes.p
Negative 6101 pI am trying to run a bash script on Mac which combines a Fortran program with a Mathemtica script Code in the following.p  pIn a nutshell, what it does is I run codeAddingns.mcode and it creates a new file named codepoints.datcode. Then the length of this file, codeNUMcode, will be used as a variable in code.pebblegame.e NUM points.dat gt pebbled.datcode applying a Fortran program on the file to create codepebbled.datcode. Then in the next loop, codeAddingns.mcode uses the existing codepoints.datcode and codepebbled.datcode to create new ones.p  precodebinbash BDMyDirectory  for i1 ilt20 i do   ApplicationsMathematica.appContentsMacOSMathKernel script Addingns.m   NUMgrep c . points.dat  echo Length points is NUM   .pebblegame.e NUM points.dat gt pebbled.dat   LENgrep c . pebbled.dat  CRITecho LEN3072  bc l  echo Criterion is CRIT  done exit codepre  pThe puzzling part is when I run the codes manually I mean type commands in terminal in the same order, it works fine but when I use codeForcode loop, it only returns the first result correctly This convinces me that problem is with my BASH script.p  pSince finally I need to loop 20000 times, I need to do this automatically.  p

This gave me a number that seem close but wasnt quite correct. i.e. both will be todays date within a few minutes has the most significant 34 digits the same but nothing else is close.p  pIs this a timezonelocal time problem Or am I just missing somethingp

Negative 6101 pYesterday we tried the developer previews iOS 8 beta 5 with Xcode 6 Beta 5 for our App.  We use location services in the webview components of our hybrid app. p  pI recognized that geolocating via UIWebView ist not working anymore.  I verified this behavior with an example from scratch loading a hrefhttpwww.w3schools.comhtmltryit.aspfilenametryhtml5geolocation relnofollowexamplea for geolocation from the w3schools.com into a UIWebView. p  pWith iOS 7, Base SDK 7.1, built with XCode 5, the notification for acceptance of the location service is prompted an after that, the app shows up under Privacy Location Services in the iPhone settings.  With iOS 8, Base SDK 8, built with XCode 6 the prompt doesnt occur and the webview location service is not working and no entry in the settings is made.  p  pI know, that with iOS 8 some changes took place for the users privacy settings especially dealing with location services in background, but I didnt expect that it will break our webviewlocation logic where we make use of the navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPositionshowPosition javascript function. p  pAnyway I am still not clear if this is a bug in iOS 8 beta or the result of some API changes and if, what would be the right way to adopt. p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 6101 pI was updating my app for iOS 8 and adding AutoLayout constraints to all my views. They are mostly working but codeUIScrollView slideUpScrollViewcode is giving me some trouble. There is one codeUIButton toggleDrawerButtoncode inside it to toggle the SVs frame. In IB, there are constraints to keep the SV at the bottom with a height of 50pts. When toggleButton is pressed, it is supposed to change the SVs origin to the top of the view, simulating a drawer effect. p  pThere is a problem with the openclose effect. When I press the toggleDrawerButton, itll sometimes produce the effect I want just like in iOS 7 does not call viewDidLayoutSubviews. Other times the SV will have an odd effect where viewDidLayoutSubviews is called after my frame movement. VDLS will then attempt to reconstrain the SV and toggleDrawerButton back to its original closed position. This causes the view to be placed back at the bottom when the drawer should be opened. VDLS seems to be called randomly on toggleDrawerButton press. Sometimes itll be called, other times it wont.    p  pHow can I correctly reposition the SVs frame to move towards the top without auto layout reconstraining it Also, why is VDLS only called sometimes upon toggleDrawerButton press The behavior isnt consistent which is making it harder to find a solution.p  pHere is the toggleDrawerButtons action code p  precode void toggleAddEditDrawer  if self.drawerToggle  0   Open the Drawer     self.drawerToggle  1      self.itemNameTextField.text  nil     self.quantityTextField.text  nil      [UIView beginAnimationsnil contextnil]     [UIView setAnimationDuration0.4]     [UIView setAnimationDelay0.0]     [UIView setAnimationCurveUIViewAnimationCurveEaseOut]      Rotate the button and make the SV frame slide up      self.toggleDrawerButton.transform  CGAffineTransformMakeRotationMPI4     self.slideUpScrollView.frame  CGRectMake0, self.tableView.frame.origin.y, self.view.frame.size.width, self.view.frame.size.height     self.slideUpScrollView.contentSize  self.slideUpScrollView.frame.size       [UIView commitAnimations]     [self.itemNameTextField becomeFirstResponder]      NSLogOPEN Toggle  tableview location is ,NSStringFromCGRectself.tableView.frame     NSLogOPEN Toggle  scrollview location is ,NSStringFromCGRectself.slideUpScrollView.frame     NSLogOPEN Toggle  toggleButton location is ,NSStringFromCGRectself.toggleDrawerButton.frame    else  Close the Drawer     self.drawerToggle  0     [UIView beginAnimationsnil contextnil]     [UIView setAnimationDuration0.4]     [UIView setAnimationDelay0.0]     [UIView setAnimationCurveUIViewAnimationCurveEaseOut]      Reverse the rotation and  make the SV frame slide down     self.toggleDrawerButton.transform  CGAffineTransformMakeRotation0     self.slideUpScrollView.frame  CGRectMake0, self.tableView.frame.origin.y  self.tableView.frame.size.height, self.view.frame.size.width, 50     self.slideUpScrollView.contentSize  self.slideUpScrollView.frame.size      [UIView commitAnimations]     [self.view endEditingYES]      NSLogCLOSE Toggle  tableview location is ,NSStringFromCGRectself.tableView.frame     NSLogCLOSE Toggle  scrollview location is ,NSStringFromCGRectself.slideUpScrollView.frame     NSLogCLOSE Toggle  toggleButton location is ,NSStringFromCGRectself.toggleDrawerButton.frame    NSLogDrawer Posistion is d,self.drawerToggle codepre  pp  pEdit Here are some console logs. p  pWorking frame animation logbr OPEN Toggle  tableview location is 0, 2, 320, 452br OPEN Toggle  scrollview location is 0, 2, 320, 504br OPEN Toggle  toggleButton location is 128.88730162779191, 6.1126983722080901, 62.225396744416173, 62.225396744416173br Drawer Posistion is 1  p  pVDLS frame reconstraint logbr OPEN Toggle  tableview location is 0, 2, 320, 452br OPEN Toggle  scrollview location is 0, 2, 320, 504br OPEN Toggle  toggleButton location is 128.88730162779191, 6.1126983722080901, 62.225396744416173, 62.225396744416173br Drawer Posistion is 1br VDLS  tableview location is 0, 2, 320, 452br VDLS  scrollview location is 0, 454, 320, 50br VDLS  toggleButton location is 128.88730162779191, 6.1126983722080901, 62.225396744416173, 62.225396744416173p

Negative 6101 pIm currently working on a project using a custom hardware running Android. The hardware is using a removable camera. p  pI have an event listener that will redirect to a certain activity when the camera is removed or inserted. The problem is that the app crashes every time it starts processing the intent to transfer to a new activity.p  pThe cause probably is that the app cannot release the camera and camera preview variables properly since the camera is already removed. However, if I opt not to release those, the app then crashes when the camera is reinserted because the previous one was not destroyed properly.p  pI just need a highlevel explanation on how to address this problem.

Negative 6101 pI notice with Firebase rules you can have a  variable to get a reference to the id of a record and then can use validation under that id. However, I cant seem to use this to restrict deletion of a record based on the id as this variable seems to be undefined not sure how to confirm this when the record is deleted. Im guessing the validation needs to be one step up but I cant seem to get a reference to the ID unless I go under the  variable.p  pan examplep  precodefruits          .read true,         .write true,         fruit            .validate root.childfruitAccess  fruit    auth.uid.exists  true           codepre  pIn this situation the the person with access to the fruit can update and create it but cannot delete it as far as I have tried.. it just comes up Permission Deniedp  pThanks for any help p  p EDIT  The crux of the issue Im having is that when a record is deleted as far as I can tell there isnt any way to get the ID or key of the record being deleted within the ruleset. Is there some method for getting the key of the data object as opposed to the newData object which you can get within the  parameter but is null on deletionp

Negative 6101 pOkay, first off Sorry if this has been asked before, but I couldnt figure out the correct keywords if it had been.p  pSituation I have a small Network server, which runs in its own Thread. The RunMethod iterates over a collection of active Sockets Both UDP and TCP, checks for Activity and does its thing. All of this is achieved via codeselectcode.p  pIt is possible, that, while stuck in codeselectcode a new server is added. For this purpose, I have incorporated a Breaker socket, which is checked alongside the others. It gets closed when a new socket is added, so the new socket will also be monitored for traffic. fdset gets regenerated each time select got brokenp  pCode is like this abbreviatedp  precodefdset fds SOCKET mSock  Breaker  FDZEROampfds Aquire Mutex ifBreaker  INVALIDSOCKET     mSock  Breaker  socketAFINET, SOCKSTREAM, 0 FDSETBreaker, ampfds Iterate over active sockets and add them to fds. Release Mutex  ifselectmSock  1, ampfds, NULL, NULL, NULL gt 0      AquireMutex     Iterate over active sockets, check for activity and act accordingly.     ifBreaker  INVALIDSOCKET ampamp FDISSETBreaker, ampfds         Close Breaker and set it to INVALIDSOCKET     Release Mutex  codepre  pNow the actual problem codeselectcode is broken continuously, no matter whether I close Breaker or not. It constantly reports activity on the socket.p  pBreaker is a simple socket, not bound or connected. If I change the type of Breaker to DGRAM, it doesnt break select at all, even if closed.p  pLanguage is C, Platform is a Linuxderivate, INVALIDSOCKET is defined as 1 and SOCKET is a typedef to int. Code is supposed to work with WinSock toop  pThank you for your help.p  pEdit Ive tried reading from the Buffer. Calling coderecvcode on the Breaker socket returned with 1, setting codeerrnocode to 107 Transport endpoint not connected, which is not surprising, seeing how it really isnt connected.p  pEdit Since my intention apparently is unclear, Ill describe it again. It is possible, that a new server socket is added to the queue at any given point in time. However this socket will not be monitored for traffic, unless select is broken and fdset is subsequently refilled with the new socket at least once. Any traffic arriving on the new socket is thereby discarded.p  pI am aware, that I could be using timeouts, but I was hoping thered be a different solution.p

Negative 6101 pI have a simple GUI application I wrote in C for the RaspBerry PI while using GTK2.0 to handle the actual UI rendering. The application so far is pretty simple, with just a few pushbuttons for testing simple functions I wrote. One button causes a thread to be woken up which prints text to the console, and goes back to sleep, while another button stops this operation early by locking a mutex, changing a status variable, then unlocking the mutex again. Fairly simple stuff so far. The point of using this threaded approach is so that I dont ever lock up the UI during a long function call, forcing the user to be blocked on the IO operations completing before the UI is usable again.  p  pIf I call the following function in my threads processing loop, I encounter a number of issues.p  precodeinclude ltopencv2objdetectobjdetect.hppgt include ltopencv2highguihighgui.hppgt include ltopencv2imgprocimgproc.hppgt  include ltstdio.hgt include lterrno.hgt  using namespace std using namespace cv  define PROJECTNAME       CAMERAMODULE  Include before liblog include ltlog.hgt  int cameraAcquireImagechar pathToImage     if pathToImage        logErrorInvalid input       return EINVAL        int iErr  0    CvCapture capture  NULL    IplImage frame, img     0default, 1any camera, 1..99your camera    capture  cvCaptureFromCAMCVCAPANY    ifcapture        logErrorNo camera interface detected       iErr  EIO        if iErr        if frame  cvQueryFramecapture  NULL           logErrorERROR frame is null...          iErr  EIO               if iErr        CvSize size  cvSize100, 100       if img  cvCreateImagesize, IPLDEPTH16S, 1  NULL           img  frame          cvSaveImagepathToImage, img               if capture        cvReleaseCaptureampcapture        return 0  codepre  pThe function uses some simple OpenCV code to take a snapshot with a webcam connected to my Raspberry PI. It issues warnings of codeVIDIOCQUERYMENU Invalid argumentcode to the console, but still manages to acquire the images and save them to a file for me. However, my GUI becomes sluggish, and sometimes hangs. If it doesnt outright hang, then the window goes blank, and I have to randomly click all over the UI area until I click on where a pushbutton would normally be located, and the UI finally rerenders again rather than showing a white empty layout.p  pHow do I go about resolving this Is this some quirk in OpenCv when using it as part of a Gtk2.0 application I had originally had my project setup as a GTK3.0 application, but it wouldnt run due to some check in GTK preventing multiple versions from being included in a single application, and it seems OpenCv is an extension of GTK2.0.p  pThank you.p

Negative 6101 pIm testing a program parallelized with OpenMP on a compute cluster. Access to the compute nodes is managed by the scheduling system OpenCCS, I submit bash scripts as jobs and they are allocated to a suitable time slot and node.p  pSome of the logical compute nodes are on a physical machine and share a physical memory, others are distributed over several physical machines and simulate shared memory with communication, which is transparent to the user, i.e. me.p  pWhether the memory is locally shared or distributed will affect the performance and I would like to know whether a given job was executed on a node with locally shared memory or distributed shared memory.

Negative 6101 pI have two vectors, say A1xN and B1xM. I want to compute their outer product and add the result to a NxM matrix. Now, I split this into two parts, first computing AB and then adding it. On profiling, the first step takes way more time than the adding 8x. Since the number of multiplications in the first step is the same as the number of additions in the second step, is the difference only due to my architecture supporting faster additions Or is it the time taken to allocate the memory for storing the result in the first step p  precodegtgt x  randn1,10000 gtgt y  randn1,10000 gtgt tic zxy toc Elapsed time is 0.560743 seconds. gtgt tic zzz toc Elapsed time is 0.132228 seconds. gtgt tic zz.z toc Elapsed time is 0.124191 seconds. codepre  pSo I figured that it is not a mult vs addition. z  zz and z  z.z have similar times.p

Negative 6101 pIm relatively new to software development, and Im on my way to completing my first app for the iPhone.p  pWhile learning Swift, I learned that I could add functions outside the class definition, and have it accessible across all views.

The error is caused by linep  precodevar tableView TableViewController  segue.destinationViewController as TableViewController codepre  pThough I still do not know why xcode tells me the bad exec happens two lines later...p  pThe reason is I embedded my TableViewController in a Navigation Controller. Hence, the app cannot convert a navigation controller to a TableViewController i.e., my custom subclass based on UITableViewController. In order to solve the problem, I just unwrap the TableViewController from the navigation controller. It turns out that if the TableViewController is pushed by a segue from a navigation controller, then it will automatically has the area for navigation bar buttons. So no need to have another navigation controller in this case.p

Im following this doc, which is very helpfulp  pa hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comguidetopicsconnectivitybluetooth.html relnofollowhttpdeveloper.android.comguidetopicsconnectivitybluetooth.htmlap  pHowever, to connect as a client I have to use this code, which uses this MYUUID symbol.p  precode       MYUUID is the apps UUID string, also used by the server code         tmp  device.createRfcommSocketToServiceRecordMYUUID codepre  pIn the text the doc says The UUID passed here must match the UUID used by the server device when it opened its BluetoothServerSocket with listenUsingRfcommWithServiceRecordString, UUID. Using the same UUID is simply a matter of hardcoding the UUID string into your application and then referencing it from both the server and client code.p  pThis is confusing to me... does it mean it must match a UUID specified in the Arduino firmware My coworker who wrote the firmware doesnt know what that would be.  When I sniff his firmware advertising, it has ID RNBTDFBC, but when I use that as a UUID I get an exception p  precodejava.lang.IllegalArgumentException RNBTDFBC is not a valid Bluetooth address codepre  pAnd none of the sample Bluetooth projects Ive looked at seem to explain the basis of this UUID value, theyre just magic numbers.p  pSo... what on earth do I use as the parameter for my createRfcommSocketToServiceRecord function  I feel like I am misunderstanding this, because a Bluetooth client cant possibly generally have such intimate knowledge of a server it wants to connect to.

Negative 6101 pI have two Flask webservices that make use of ScipyNumpy libraries. Due to  C extensions in both libraries, I followed directions mentioned in a few posts and websites and had both under GLOBAL application group. The problem Im having is that the first app that I send a http request to returns valid results, while the second app will always return a 404.

Negative 6101 pI am trying to make the generation of voxelcubes more efficient. First of all I calculate on the cpu which faces are not hidden by other voxelscubes. Than I send the voxelcube position and the face normal to the gpu  the vertex, geometry and fragment shader. So now I want simply to generate in the geometry shader a triangle strip from the strongvoxel positionstrong and strongface normalstrong. But now I have problems to calculate the four new vertices from these two informations, I cant find a solution without if and else functions. And since I use backface culling I have to pay attention to the order I emit the vertices from the shader, too. Whats the most efficient way to solve my problem Or have someone a better idea than my approachp  pThe normal vector can only have 6 states, for each face of a cube 0, 0, 1 Front 0, 0, 1 Back 0, 1, 0 Up 0, 1, 0 Down 1, 0, 0 Right 1, 0, 0 Leftp

Negative 6101 pI have pretty standard java project with standard gradle layout, all sources are stored in git. I want to write documentation in markdown or similar markup language and keep all files in project directory e.g. docs folder in the root. Then I want to generate static site or push my sources somewhere to have access to full documentation in html should be selfhosted solution.p  pIt will be good if Im able to add simple link to other articles like I do it in any wiki engine by using code[[article]]code. And It would be perfect if Ive been able to add quick links to javadoc by the same technique as link to articles. And also it would be perfect if it has had builtin search engine.p  pIve gone through couple of static site generators but I didnt find anything which can satisfy my requirements at least half. Is there something like that Or I need to code it by myself I know it wont take to much time Maybe theres more common use case for documentationp
Negative 6101 pHow can I render my polygon behind the kml layerp  pI have a kml layer imported into my Google Maps canvas. Also, I have implemented a polygon, which is drawn on the canvas whenever you click emDrawem.p  pThe issue is that when you click emDrawem the polygon is drawn on top of the kml markers. Thus, I cannot click any marker and visualize their respective names. In other words, I would like to be able to know which markers are included inside the drawn polygon, and for that I would need to click the marker and see its corresponding name.p  pI believe the solution lies in using panes. I am aware of panes and the order in which they are arranged, but I dont know how to implement a solution using them.p  pTo follow, Im including my code almost exactly as I have it, so you can see what I am talking about and test it yourself. The only difference is that Im not including my key for GoogleMaps, so where you see strongAPIKEYstrong, replace for your own key.

When I change the ending condition to any number other than 20, it only prints runs for half of that number.  p  pAttached is only the relevant pieces of the code.

I strongly assume that its related to the fact that codecurrentFramecode is allocated on the emstackem and not on the emheapem, and thus I cant just reassign the variable. Being a novice to C however, I am not familiar with how to handle these kinds of situations. Should I use pointers here instead and try to allocate codecurrentFramecode on the heap p  pTo be clear, my goal is to generate a series of codeframescode that depend on some previous frame. Can anyone point me into the right direction herep  pstrongUpdatestrong Thanks a lot for all the hints in the comments, I now understand that the issue comes from the fact that I declare coderegionscode as codeconstcode. I rewrote the code to use pointers instead of heap variables, it now looks like thisp  precodevectorltFramegt shot Frame currentFrame  generateRandomFrame Frame currentFramePtr  ampcurrentFrame  the first frame in the shot is random for int i  0 i lt length i      shot.pushbackcurrentFramePtr     Frame tmpFrame  generateNextFramecurrentFramePtr     currentFramePtr  amptmpFrame   codepre  pThis code does compile now, however it still doesnt do what I want. According to my understanding it should now work, because I am storing the codecurrentFramecode in a pointer, so I can easily override it with new objects that I create. But it seems that there still is a bug, the frame generation doesnt work as expected that is any new frame is generated with 0 regions while the number of regions should be identical to the previous frame. Can anyone see whats wrong with this updated version of my codep

Negative 6101 pThe scenario is thisp  pThere are 13 items in a projection in total. In default Orchard displays 2 pages 10 on the 1st, 3 on the 2nd page.

Negative 6101 pIm trying to update my UITableView in the background. While my current code is working Im having 2 major errors with it.p  pIn more detail. Im using coreData to fill the cells. But I also have 2 APIs I need to connect to.p  pCurrently. I have 2 functionsp  pcodeloadSuggestionscode and codeupdateSuggestionscodep  pcodeloadSuggestionscode fills gets the correct information and it displays fine.p  pcodeupdateSuggestionscode deletes all the current data, fetches the new data, saves it into CoreData, and reloads the codeUITableViewcode. this function is run as the last thing in my codeloadSuggestionscode function, in the backgroundp  pSo my major problem. Is when I load the suggestions. If I try to interact with the UITableView before its done updating I get the error codefatal error Array index out of rangecode The reason is simple. Im deleting the CoreData in the beginning of my function. During this period, it expects my array to be 0, but scrolling down obviously tries to load data outside the array index.p  pHowever I have no idea how to fix the above problem.p  pMy second lesser important issue lies in performance After the updateSuggestions is done running. It doesnt actually update my codeUITableViewcode with the changed data until several seconds later, or if I interact with the codeUITableViewcode. It should of course, update the moment its done updatingp  pI have no clue on how to fix either of the 2 problems. hence why Im here.p  pHeres my code for the 2 functionsp  ploadSuggestionsp  precodefunc loadSuggestions       println Loading Data       Set the managedContext again.     managedContext  appDelegate.managedObjectContext       Check what API to get the data from     if Formula  0          formulaEntity  TrialFormulaStock         printlnSetting Entity formulaEntity         formulaAPI  NSURLstring httpapi.comjsonentryweekly.json      else if Formula  1          formulaEntity  ProFormulaStock         printlnSetting Entity formulaEntity         formulaAPI  NSURLstring httpapi.comjsonentryweekly.json      else if Formula  2          formulaEntity  PremiumFormulaStock         formulaAPI  NSURLstring httpapi.comjsonproffweekly.json         printlnSetting Entity formulaEntity      else if Formula  3          formulaEntity  PlatinumFormulaStock         printlnSetting Entity formulaEntity         formulaAPI  NSURLstring httpapi.comjsonfundweekly.json            Delete all the current objects in the dataset     let fetchRequest  NSFetchRequestentityName formulaEntity     let a  managedContext.executeFetchRequestfetchRequest, error nil as [NSManagedObject]     stocks.removeAllkeepCapacity false     for mo in a          stocks.appendmo           Removing them from the array       Saving the now empty context.     managedContext.savenil       Reload the tableview with the new data.     self.tableView.reloadData     self.view.hideLoading     self.refreshControl.endRefreshing      dispatchasyncdispatchgetglobalqueueIntQOSCLASSUSERINITIATED.value, 0          self.updateSuggestions        codepre  pand updateSuggestionsp  precodefunc updateSuggestions      printlnUpdating Suggestions     if Reachability.isConnectedToNetwork  false          printlnERROR gt No Internet Connection lt      else           Delete all the current objects in the dataset         let fetchRequest  NSFetchRequestentityName formulaEntity         let a  managedContext.executeFetchRequestfetchRequest, error nil as [NSManagedObject]         for mo in a              managedContext.deleteObjectmo                   Removing them from the array         stocks.removeAllkeepCapacity false          Saving the now empty context.         managedContext.savenil           Set up a fetch request for the API data         let entity   NSEntityDescription.entityForNameformulaEntity, inManagedObjectContextmanagedContext         var request  NSURLRequestURL formulaAPI         var data  NSURLConnection.sendSynchronousRequestrequest, returningResponse nil, error nil         var formula  JSONdata data           Loop through the api data.         for index String, actionable JSON in formula[actionable]                Save the data into temporary variables             stockName  actionable[name].stringValue             ticker  actionable[ticker].stringValue             action  actionable[action].stringValue             suggestedPrice  actionable[suggestedprice].floatValue             weight  actionable[percentageweight].floatValue               Set up CoreData for inserting a new object.             let stock  NSManagedObjectentity entity,insertIntoManagedObjectContextmanagedContext               Save the temporary variables into coreData             stock.setValuestockName, forKey name             stock.setValueticker, forKey ticker             stock.setValueaction, forKey action             stock.setValuesuggestedPrice, forKey suggestedPrice             stock.setValueweight, forKey weight               Get ready for second API call.             var quoteAPI  NSURLstring httpdev.markitondemand.comApiv2Quotejsonsymbolticker               Second API fetch.             var quoteRequest  NSURLRequestURL quoteAPI             var quoteData  NSURLConnection.sendSynchronousRequestquoteRequest, returningResponse nil, error nil             if quoteData  nil                   Save the data from second API call to temporary variables                 var quote  JSONdata quoteData                 betterStockName  quote[Name].stringValue                 lastPrice  quote[LastPrice].floatValue                  printlnUpdated lastPrice for betterStockName                   The second API call doesnt always find something, so checking if it exists is important.                 if betterStockName                        stock.setValuebetterStockName, forKey name                                    This can simply be set, because it will be 0 if not found.                 stock.setValuelastPrice, forKey lastPrice               else                  printlnERROR  NO DATA for ticker                             Error handling             var error NSError             if managedContext.saveamperror                  printlnCould not save error, error.userInfo                           Append the object to the array.

The codeuSamplercode and codevTextureCoordcode work well together, so as long as Im making simple things like color tweaks all seems well, but for toying with texture coordinates its simply not reliable. p  pCan a PhaserPixi guru explain why it works that way, and what Im supposed to do to get clear coordinates and work with my actual source texture a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netq5srLgp318 relnofollowI managed to hack a shadera by fixing codevTextureCoordcode and plugging my texture in codeiChannel0code, but this feels a bit hacky.p  pThanks.p

Ive attempted to use a custom URL scheme to launch from within the parent app usingp  precodeapplicationapplication UIApplication, handleWatchKitExtensionRequest userInfo  codepre  pin the AppDelegate via     p  precodeUIApplication.sharedApplication.openURLNSURLstringopenForCallopen codepre  pThat didnt seem to work and then now Ive implemented handoff which works fine except for the fact the user needs to active from the lockscreen and slide up from the icon on the left. Is it possible to bring an app into the foreground legally, meaning Apple Approved method via some other method Any help would be appreciated.p

Negative 6101 pIm not sure if I titled the question properly, but here goesp  pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pWe have a massive amount of records in a table that is assigned a Mask in a nightly process. This Mask is made up from a profile assigned to the record, and the Profile basically describes the matrix that is used. p  pThe Profile A Profile can have x States and each State can have x Levels. Currently because of limitations in codeSQLServercode we have cut the matrix in pieces to consist of 4 15x15 blocks as some Profiles can have up to 27 States, and some states can have up to 30 Levels. Each block is assigned a number from 1 to 15 in each state, and each state is then numbered as well 1  15.p  pWhen an record is loaded into the table, a process determines in which Level of each state this records belongs to. Each record can only belong in 1 Level per state at any time egp  precode                                              Levels                                                      State               0    1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9    Number of Children   0    1    2   gt3     Salary Bracket      lt10kgt10k    Property Owner       Yes  No   codepre  pA number is calculated on the Level eg codePOWER2, of State1Lvl1code and this number is used when criteria is spesified to determine if the record should be selected. To buildup the Mask of the record, the actual index of the Level is used and codeshift leftcode by 4 in this instance by the index of the state and then all of totals are codeORcodeed together to get a value. This value can then easily be used to select records from the table for people that only have 3 children for instance. p  pI am currenly sitting with the problem though then when I work on a subset of data with 500k records, and want to calculate counts for each level for each state, that my process is becoming a bit slow, because I have to go through each record to determine the actual Level of the state and count it.p  pstrongNow for the questionstrong  Is there an easier way of doing this in a cube SQLServer can handle bigints which is 64bit ints, and it workes fine, but I think there should be better ways of handeling this type of operations. If somebody can point me in the right direction on what to search for it will help as well.p

The idea is to achieve user workspacesp  precode..userworkspacecataloggraphgraph ..maindatasetsubdatasetgraphgraphModel ..company.combiologyanimalsgraphrabbitsanatomy codepre  pWhich seems to be natural. Now, the question is, how exactly you do thisp  ol liCan one post some data to a standalone Fuseki so it can handle the task li liOr you have to deploy your project with embedded version somehowli ol  pI know there are jenafuseki packages with fuseki as warjarp  precodeapachejenafuseki jenafusekiwar jenafusekiserver codepre  pAssuming you have to run an embedded server  which one is to use and how Ive tried them and maven does create an overlay for the war, but Ive no idea how to communicate with it and all my RequestMappings seems to be off...p  pIve also tried the old org.apache.jena.fuseki.EmbeddedFusekiServer.

Negative 6101 pI have an EditText with input type of number. It subscribes to the OnFocusChangeListener event. It shows the usual number pad on clicking. When I change my focus from this EditText to a Button next to it, it automatically pops up a text keyboard. Is this some common bug in the android or some code error p  pWhen the number pad is minimized, this doesnt happen. I have no other text box in the layout, just one EditText and few buttons, so it doesnt seem like a code error.p  pMy application min SDK version is 14 and target is 22.p  pThanks in advance.p  pEdit the focus change listener updates an object. It has the following codep  precodeOverride     public void onFocusChangeView v, boolean hasFocus              if hasFocus                      Model cm  Model ViewGroup v.getParent.getTag              cm.setWidthInteger.parseIntEditText v.getEditableText.toString             notifyDataSetChanged               codepre

It seems that I should be able to do this using lookup fields but I dont know how to get it to reference the proper ID number in the lists. I can add a lookup field into Entries that looks up the field ResourceName and ResourceID but I dont know how to establish the relationship between the IDs. I have only ever succesfully established relationships when creating new lists, not ones that are already built. I am starting to think I am going about this in the wrong way, but it seems to me that this is what lookups are for so I might just be missing something.  Thanks for taking the time to read this and thanks to anyone who might be able to offer me some insight on what I am doing wrong.p
Negative 6101 pi have been googleing for a few days to find out if it is possible to overlay multiple images i.e. roof.png , walls.png and then dynamically apply overlay colors to them depending on the users click on colors. p  pI solved the first part to colorize the roof but it gets complicated impossible when I add the second layer, the walls. The roof.png is above the walls.png and the color effect is not visible.p  pWhat I want to achieve is a coloring scheme like a hrefhttpdakotasteelandtrim.comvisualizer relnofollowherea but not with separate images for all the colors i.e. roofblue.png , roofred.png but with css rules for the transparent roof.png. Any suggestion is highly appreciated.p  pEDITED p  pI will try to be more specific so you can concentrate on the solution if there is one...

Negative 6101 pI am working on a project that uses data to generate a Highcharts plot. Basically, its just an xy lineseries plot, but the chart is using the wrong data for the xaxis. I am trying to figure out why this is occuring. The snippet of code that I have is as followsp  precodevar data  this.costAnalyzerService.OpenCostWindowDataToSend, CurrentTrain, CustId var obj  Jsondata, JsonRequestBehavior.AllowGet return obj codepre  pThe data variable is of type codeSystems.Collections.Generic.ListltSystem.Tupleltint, double, doublegtgtcodep  pBasically, all the data in this variable is correct. The int should be my xaxis, and the two doubles are my two sets of line series data. I have reason to believe that the code that is generating the plot is not using the int as the xaxis. Rather, it is simply using 1,2,3...,N points as the xaxis numbers. p  pHow can I peek into this JSON object to see what is going on and what it is returning. If I step through the code past this point, the chart simply generates and the execution of the application finishes. There are no more step points to debug after this point. Literally, the function returns the JSON object and finishes. It doesnt even return to the calling function, so far as I can tell. p  pHere is the COMPLETE method that I am working withp  precode public JsonResult PlotCostAnalyzerChartdouble acidPrice  0.0,

Negative 6101 pI have an Autobahn Python client application using Twisted which is connected to a Crossbar.io server. The client application can successfully reconnect after losing network connectivity using the ReconnectingClientFactory. The client registers a callee name when connected so that other applications can call it. This always works on the initial connection.p  pHowever, when recovering from a lost connection, the callee name cannot be reregistered because the callee name is still registered from the prior lost connection. This results in the error wamp.error.procedurealreadyexists. Because the callee name registration is still associated with the prior lost connection, I am to unregister the old callee name.p  pThe only solution I can see is to generate and register a unique new callee name on each connection to avoid colliding with prior registered callee names.p  pIs there a better or simpler way to deal with this It seems that the WAMP protocol would allow unregistering a callee name from another connection using the registration id, but the Autobahn Python client library does not seem to allow this.p

Negative 6101 pA couple of weeks it was working fine, even when we set a proxy host,port,proxyauthentication. There was no change in the proxy settings itself, but suddenly the push notifications stopped to reach the device.p  pThe used library is Javapns2.3.336p  pFor testing purpose, we created a simple code to check if it is working without a proxy. If we test on a system where we do not need a proxy, it is working fine. If we test the same code on the system with the proxy, it is not working. javapsn logs show in both message has been streamed out successfully in debug log.p  pstrongEDIT 1strong Here is the little test code I usedremoved critical data with SOME...p  precode ListltPushedNotificationgt notifications  new ArrayListltPushedNotificationgt        ListltStringgt devices  new ArrayListltStringgt         devices.addSOMEDEVICE         ListltDevicegt appleDevices  Devices.asDevicesdevices          AppleNotificationServer server  new AppleNotificationServerBasicImpl                 SOMECERT, SOMEPW, false       String encodeProxyAuthorization  encodeProxyAuthorizationuserName,               userPassword       server.setProxySOMEPROXY, SOMEPORT       server.setProxyAuthorizationencodeProxyAuthorization          PushNotificationManager pushNotificationManager  new PushNotificationManager         pushNotificationManager.initializeConnectionserver          Payload payload  NewsstandNotificationPayload.contentAvailable          pushNotificationManager.sendNotificationappleDevices.get0, payload,                 false          System.out.printlnDONE codepre  pThen we created a tcpdump and checked if there is a problem with the connection between the proxy and apple server. But looking into the tcpdump you can see that the handshake is fine and everything is sent to Apple, even the content.available was sent and we receive the acknowledgement and finish flag.p  pInbound and outbound TCP packets are allowed over port 2195 and 2196.p  pCertificate is the same created when it worked before. We used it also on the test without the proxy and it worked fine.p  pThe next step would be to test the feedback service with the workaround of having 2 sandbox apps on your device so that we can check the tcpdump again when we receive something from the feedback service.p  pstrongEDIT 2strong emCreated just a skeleton app which does nothing and only connects to the APNS. Then we deleted the original App and we where able to receive a response from the Feedback Service. After this initial test without proxy, i triggered the same code with proxy settings on the other environment. We also received the invalid token id from the Feedback Service. This basically means, that our Push Notifications where sent to Apple APNS but never arrived on the devices. So we tried something else, we reinstalled the app and tested it on both systems. Now it seems to work on both systems. There where no changes in the proxy settings and no changes in the infrastructure. I do not think that this test scenario is solving this issue, but from now on it seems to work.emp  pIs there something I am missing I have the feeling it is a tiny thing I am missing to make it work again...p

Question is What gets displayed in console. p  pAnd I really have some problems with understanding. p  pHere is the codep  precodepublic static void felda     char[] felda  2,0x31,48     for int i  0 ilt felda.length i         System.out.println    felda[i]          System.out.println  public static void feldb     int[] feldb  2,0x31,48     for int i  0 ilt feldb.length i         System.out.println    feldb[i]          System.out.println  public static void feldc     int [] feldc  2,0x31,48     for int i  0 ilt feldc.length i         System.out.println    char feldc[i]          System.out.println  codepre  pSo if I run in the Solution isp  precode 2  1  0   50  49  48   2  1  0 codepre  pSo i dont understand how it is even possible to have an int definded with  .  And i find it very confusing how int feldb  2 results in beeing 50 and int feldb0x31 results in beeing 49.. dam this is all so confusing. I hope someone can enlighten me. p  pEdit Why is char feldc  48 resulting in beeing 0p  pSorry for bad english, and also sorry for bad java skills.p
Negative 6101 pIn my company, I have have to test if a server is responding correctly. p  pThe main test is to ask people form the company to connect simultaneously to the server at the same time. p  pI want to automate this procedure and doing it with one computer.
