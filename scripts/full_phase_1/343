Positive 343 pI am creating a user control which contains 2 ListView controls. I want the user to be able to use Designer to set the Columns property for the user control and the 2 ListView controlsbasically, the Columns property for the user control and the 2 ListView controls are to be synced to each other, using the exact same ColumnHeader collections.p  pFor the user control itself, in order for the Columns property to work properly as a collection of column headers, I find I must inherit from System.Collections.ObjectModel.Collection. I set the collection class to Serializable and the class property to DesignerSerializationVisibilityDesignerSerializationVisibility.Content. When I do this, and use the user control on a form and add columns to the Columns property, I find in the forms Designer in InitializeComponents that the Add method of the collection class is used to add the ColumnHeader variables created. This works.p  pWhat I have trouble doing, however, is syncing the Columns collection property with the Columns properties of the 2 ListView controls. For the inherited collection class inherited from Collection, I cannot override the Add method, so I cant set the Add method to also add the ColumnHeader to the Columns properties of the 2 Listview controls.p  pHow do I assure that the Columns properties of the 2 ListView controls always change to match changes in the user controls Columns propertyp

A and other heuristic graph traversal algorithms are great for low dimensional problems. But the area I want to move across is infinite in size and only has a handful of obstacles scattered across it. The nodes themselves, or rather the potential positions, are infinitely small. This could of course be optimized with a quad tree of some sort but I have a feeling simple movement vectors that are in some way rotated and interpolated can solve this as well.p

There is a table with them, where each session is represented by a row with unique IDp  precodeCREATE TABLE sessions     id BIGSERIAL NOT NULL,     username CHARACTER VARYING32 NOT NULL,     someconnectiondata BYTEA NOT NULL,     bytesreceived BIGINT NOT NULL,     bytessent BIGINT NOT NULL,     CONSTRAINT sessionspkey PRIMARY KEY id  codepre  pAnd as accounting data flows, this table receives a lot of UPDATEs like thosep  precode There are lots of such queries UPDATE sessions SET bytesreceived  bytesreceived  53554,                     bytessent  bytessent  30676                 WHERE id  42 codepre  pWhen we receive a never ending stream with quite a lot like 12 per second of updates for a table with a lot like several thousands of sessions, probably thanks to MVCC, this makes PostgreSQL emveryem busy. Are there any ways to speed everything up, or Postgres is just not exactly suitable for this task and Id better consider it unsuitable for this job and put those counters to another storage like memcachedb, using Postgres only for fairly static data But Ill miss an ability to infrequently query on this data, for example to find TOP10 downloaders, which is not really good.p  pUnfortunately, the amount of data emcannotem be lowered much. The ISP accounting example is all thought up to simplify the explanation. The real problems with another system, which structure is somehow harder to explain.p  pThanks for suggestionsp
Negative 343 pMy ASP.NET MVC web app requires the upload of image files. These image files are then displayed via a partial view rendering where the path of the image file is inserted into the scr parm of the image tag. This works great in development mode however when I deploy to the server the images wont display. I have tried many way to specify the path including ResolveClientUrl to no avail. As a test I hard coded the path of some images that were not uploaded but part of the original content and they display fine from the server. Here is the partial with some additiona image tags inserted for testing. Again all display fine on my local dev environment but when deployed to the server dont.

Negative 343 pI have an idea for a new desktop environment that involves a radically different user interface than existing ones, and I want to begin prototyping it. However, I dont want to go through all the trouble of building it from scratch just for the prototype, so I want to build it on top of an existing desktop environment so I can have immediate access to all the data and functionality of the existing one to build on.p  pbWhat platform would be best to start building onbp  pFor example, I was thinking of building it in Xcode as a fullscreen app, and simulating the way it would manipulate media on the computer by using the iTunes API to select and perform actions on the users media. Basically, emulating the OS as a fullscreen Cocoa app, and using iTunes as the media engine to simulate user interaction with media, for starters.p  pThis might not be the best way to go about this since I dont know how I would simulate running applications and windows, animations might be difficult to do in ObjectiveC, etc, so are there any ideas out there on how to simulate this desktop environment betterp  pEdit The focus is on how the user interacts and commands the computer, so its all in the humancomputer language and interaction, meaning the programming and code is whats most relevant.p
Negative 343 pOn windows, each thread has a message queue, and each message queue will process messages for the windows owned by that thread. This means that it is quite simple to write an application where you can create a thread, with a message loop, and one or more windows. Ignoring any kind of application issues, one now has application windows that will keep on interacting with the user even if one of the other windows is busy in some kind of modal operation.p  pNow, in porting the app to cocoa, I encounter, well, Interface Builder. Which is a surprise to  someone who expects to be more in control of window creation and message loop construction. None the less I can see where IB is coming from.p  pMy problem however, lies with the opaque funciton NSApplicationMain. This  on the applications main thread, automatically creates the applications main window, and runs the message pump, all data driven nicely from the NIB files.p  pHowever, this leaves me with a problem Even if I buy into the idea that Interface Builder is the way to go for making my main app window  and I have figured out enough objective C to create sub windows on the fly  as well as how to create threads  I cans see how to create a message pump in worker threads. I begin to doubt its possible.p  pDo windows in cocoa even have the kind of thread affinity they do In Win32 i.e. each thread has its own message dispatching loop for windows owned by that thread Im beginning to suspect that perhaps Cocoa expects all my windows to be owned by the main thread and I just get to offset work and drawing onto other threads.p  pAny clues as to how best to translate a multi windowperthread Win32 app to Cocoas paradigmsp

Negative 343 pThe project Im working on includes two what Ill call Libraries of code developed by other teams. Using TFS, we would simply include their TFS folders in our workspaces and include their Visual Studio projects in our solution files.

We plan on treating these branches as readonly  well never make our own changes.p  pAt certain times we would want to refresh these branches when each Library is at a stable point. Most teams are using SCRUM, so this would be the code from the end of each Library teams Sprints.

Negative 343 pI will try to be as specific as I can be.  I inherited a very antiquated C ISAPI filter that secures a classic ASP website and was tasked with the job of creating an HTTPModule to directly replace it.p  pFirst I hooked into the OnPreRequestHandlerExecute event.  I then successfully recreated the calls to the stored procs that the original ISAPI filter made.  Those calls return a statusCode which I toss into a CASE statement and depending on the status code, set a redirection string variable sUrl.  For example statusCode 15 will set sUrl to SessionLogin.asp.  This all works successfully.p  pThe next step is the actual redirect of the page.  In C the module was doing the followingp  precodeHeaders.pushbackHeadersListvaluetypeurl, SessionErrorsSecurIDRequired.asp codepre  pI am attempting to recreate this functionality by using the followingp  precodeHttpContext.Current.RewritePathsUrl codepre  pThis works 100 for all classic asp pages.  The problem creeps up when the user trys to access httpsomedomain.comBlah.jpg.  The module successfully runs, sets the proper statusCode of 15, and the RewritePath method is called, but does not rewrite the URL to the login page.  The same thing happens for any non classic ASP page.p  pSo I started looking at other options instead of RewritePath and looked at TransferRequest.  This looked promising so I changed the code top  precodeHttpContext.Current.Server.TransferRequestsUrl, true codepre  pThis now routes all requested file types to the login page but bizarre things occur.  First off I get the following client side errors in FireBugp  blockquote   psyntax error a hrefhttpssomedomain.comJSjQueryjquery.js relnofollowhttpssomedomain.comJSjQueryjquery.jsa Line 2p blockquote  p... some other javascript errors that revolve around jQuery.

Have you ever wondered why [install new software] is under [help] menu because [helpinstall new software] does not actually provide any help documentation on installing software. It does not help you resolve all the missing requirements or where to find them.p  pThe response was  ... cannot complete ...  and then took a long long long time generating a reason why it could not be completed even though I have a quad core 6gb machine. The reason was  ... mylyn feature not found ... . p  pThen, I reduced my installation selection to only the three core items, and after a long3 time, the reason for  ... cannot complete ...  was  ... mylyn something else ... not found.p  pSo I diverted the install to galileos update site and installed every mylyn item I could find. I had to restart eclipse. Then I went back to using springide update site to attempt installing only the top three core. This time, after another long3 while, the reason for incompletability was  ... mylyn jira feature not found ....p  pSo I woogled and googled for eclipse mylyn jira connector which led me to Spring web site which makes some emforeign keyem references to JIRA. At some point a site suggested that I installed a hrefhttpdownload.eclipse.orgtoolsmylynupdatee3.4 relnofollowhttpdownload.eclipse.orgtoolsmylynupdatee3.4a to get jira. I did as advised, and nope still  ... jira feature not found ...p  pSomehow, surprisingly, when I googled wtf is eclipse mylyn jira connector it pointed me to a site advising  jira has moved to atlassian ..... At that point, I was wondering ... why do i have to prefix expletives in my google search expression to get a useful answer p  pTo cut this episode of the story shorter, I installed every gastronomic item atlassian update site had to offer on the menu. I had to restart eclipse.p  pStill when tried installing Spring IDE again, just the top three items, the incompletability reason was again  ... jira feature not found ... .p  pBut if I selected every item to be installed, the incompletability reason was  ... something something eclipse ajdt not found ....p  pAt this point I have two crucial questions for which I need answersp  ul lipIs there a complete list of whatever I need to install and where to find them, in order to complete my Spring IDE installation successfullypli lipShould I trust Spring technology to be able to provide a hassle free route to mvpmvc automation, if they cannot even provide comprehensive, useful and workable instructions on how to install their product iow, Should I bother with Spring Or, should I continue my current menialmanual methodpli ul  pAnd a trivial question When installing modules, netbeans resolves all the requirements for me, why doesnt eclipsep

If you just do everything with the main GUI right click the project  properties it quickly becomes a mess, difficult to maintain and prone to bugs like failing to correctly define some macro, or using the wrong runtime library, etc. Dealing with the fact that different people put there dependency libraries in different places eg mine all live in CLibs[C,C][libname] and then often manage the different versions of those libraries differently as well release, debug, x86, x64, etc is also a large problem since it vastly complicates the time to set it up on a new system, and then there is issues with versioncontrol and keeping everyones paths separate...p  pProperty sheets make this a bit better, but I cant have one sheet have separate settings for different configurations and platforms the drop down boxes a greyed out, resulting in me having many sheets which if inherited in the correct order do what I want x86, x64, debug, release, common, directories deals with the previously mentioned dependency issue by defining user macros like BoostX86LibDir, etc and if inherited in the wrong order eg common before x64 and debug lead to issues like trying to link an incorrect library version, or incorrectly naming the output...p  pWhat I want is a way of dealing with all these scattered dependencies and setting up a set of rules which are used by all my projects in the solution, like naming an output library as mylib[vc90,vc100][x86,x64][d].lib, without having to do all this for each individual project, configuration and platform combination, and then keep them all correctly in sync.p  pI am aware of moving to entirely different systems like CMake that create the needed files, however this then complicates things elsewhere by making it so even simple tasks like adding a new file to the project then requires additional changes elsewhere, which is not something I am entirely happy with either, unless there is some with VS2010 integration which can keep track of these sorts of changes.p

Negative 343 pIm new to Python.  Lets say I have a dictionary in which the keys map to integers likep  precoded  key11,key214,key347 codepre  pIs there a syntactically minimalistic way to return the sum of the values in di.e. 62 in this case.p  pThanksp
Negative 343 pI have a list of strings and I want to convert it to some kind of grouped list, whereby the values would be grouped by their location in the list not normal grouping, but in a way, that the same items are in a group only if they are together. Consider the following examplep  precodeLinkedListltstringgt myList  new LinkedListltstringgt myList.AddLastaaa myList.AddLastaaa myList.AddLastbbb myList.AddLastbbb myList.AddLastaaa myList.AddLastaaa myList.AddLastaaa  LinkedListltMyTuplegt groupedList  new LinkedListltMyTuplegt groupedList.AddLastnew MyTupleaaa, 2 groupedList.AddLastnew MyTuplebbb, 2 groupedList.AddLastnew MyTupleaaa, 3 codepre  pCan this transformation be done with LINQ or should I write the algorithm usual way with loopsp
Negative 343 pI want to sort a GridView by clicking on the header. I guess all i need is the header name and then pass it into sql to get the data back sorted. How is it possible to get the header namep

Negative 343 pI just updated our app to an universal app for iPhone and iPad. I made all the changes classes, nib, targeted device family, icons and so on and it worked just fine on the simulator and my iPhoneiPad developer devices. I submitted the app to the app store and yesterday it got ready for sale. The problem is that it shows just the iPhone Version and Screenshots in the app store and when I install the app on the iPad it just shows the iPhone version.  I have no clue what Ive could make wrongp  pDoes anyone know what it could be Does it need a special certificateprovisiong profile or something else I found nothing on google about that.p
Negative 343 psolved, strongsee my FINAL ANSWER post for complete details on what worked for mestrongp  poriginal question and edits belowp  plooking for a way to set multiple sql items by a posted array.p  pim pretty sure Im using php5.p  phere is how i set a single one, but i dont know much about arrays in phpp  precodemysqlquery      UPDATE comics      SET xml  UpdateXMLxml,comicpageNumber, ltpageNumbergt.pageNumber.ltpageNumbergt     WHERE id  id  or dieErrmysqlerror codepre  pi would like to Post an idArray and a newPageNumberArray from flashp  pwhere comic with id of idArray[0] would set its pageNumber to newPageNumberArray[0]   and so on.p  pthe arrays would be of equal length to each other.  but could be of any length, depending on the number of altered page numbers in the admin tool.p  pfor now i could just make a separate php request per item, but i think it would be much cleaner to send them all out in one php request.p  pstrongeditstrongp  pThanks to Patrick i feel closer... but i still dont have it quite right.p  pflash sends these arraysp  pidArr 34,24p  ppageNumArr 1,2p  pin php i have this functionp  precodefunction changePageNumberscon, idArr, pageNumArr      selectDataBasecon     echo ampstartForLooptrue     fori0iltcountidArri               thisPageNum  mysqlrealescapestringpageNumArr[i]         thisId  mysqlrealescapestringidArr[i]          echo ampthisPageNum.thisPageNum         echo ampthisId.thisId          mysqlquery                  UPDATE comics          SET xml  UpdateXMLxml,comicpageNumber, ltpageNumbergt.thisPageNum.ltpageNumbergt         WHERE id  .thisId.

Negative 343 pstrongQuestionstrongp  pIs it a good rule of thumb for database IDs to be meaningless  Conversely, are there significant benefits from having IDs structured in a way where they can be recognized at a glance  What are the pros and consp  pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pI just had a debate with my coworkers about the consistency of the IDs in our database.  We have a datadriven application that leverages spring so that we rarely ever have to change code. That means, if theres a problem, a data change is usually the solution.p  pMy argument was that by making IDs consistent and readable, we save ourselves significant time and headaches, long term.  Once the IDs are set, they dont have to change often and if done right, future changes wont be difficult.  My coworkers position was that IDs should never matter.  Encoding information into the ID violates DB design policies and keeping them orderly requires extra work that, we dont have time for.  I cant find anything online to support either position.  So Im turning to all the gurus here at SAp  pstrongExamplestrongp  pImagine this simplified list of database records representing food in a grocery store, the first set represents data that has meaning encoded in the IDs, while the second does notp  hr  pemIDs with meaningemp  precodeType 1 Fruit 2 Veggie  Product 101 Apple 102 Banana 103 Orange 201 Lettuce 202 Onion 203 Carrot  Location 41 Aisle four top shelf 42 Aisle four bottom shelf 51 Aisle five top shelf 52 Aisle five bottom shelf  ProductLocation 10141 Apple on aisle four top shelf 10241 Banana on aisle four top shelf just by reading the ids, its easy to recongnize that these are both Fruit on Aisle 4 codepre  pemIDs without meaningemp  precodeType 1 Fruit 2 Veggie  Product 1 Apple 2 Banana 3 Orange 4 Lettuce 5 Onion 6 Carrot  Location 1 Aisle four top shelf 2 Aisle four bottom shelf 3 Aisle five top shelf 4 Aisle five bottom shelf  ProductLocation 1 Apple on aisle four top shelf 2 Banana on aisle four top shelf given the IDs, its harder to see that these are both fruit on aisle 4 codepre  hr   pstrongSummarystrongp  pWhat are the pros and cons of keeping IDs readable and consistent  Which approach do you generally prefer and why  Is there an accepted industry bestpracticep  pstrong edit strong emhelpful background info from comments, belowem strong strongp  pIn our tables, the Primary Key is always an ID field containing a unique integer. At first, that integer was arbitrary. Over time, some of these IDs naturally took on meaning among developerstesters. During a recent refactor, certain developers also took time to make all IDs easier to recognize. It made everyones job 100X easier. Some people who dont actually use the datacode vehemently disagreed for theoretical reasons. In practice, not one of those objections are holding true. Moreover, all developers using the data agree that its now significantly easier to maintain.p  pIm looking for but havent seen a defensible argument against using immediately recognizable IDs in a datacentric environment.p

Negative 343 pIm new to the C world, but I have some experience with C and read some tutorials about C. Now, creating objects in C seems quite easy and works well for me as long as the class has only attributes that are values not pointers.p  pNow, when I try to create objects which allocate memory in the constructor for some of their attributes, I figure out how exactly such objects are passed between functions. A simple example of such class would bep  precodeclass A    int a public   Aint value      thisgta  new int     thisgta  value      A      delete thisgta      int getValue const  return thisgta   codepre  pI want to use the class and pass it by value to other functions, etc. At least these examples must work without creating memory leaks or double free errors.p  precodeA f1     some function that returns A   A value5    ...   return value  void f2A a     takes A as a parameter    ...   A a  f1 A b  a f2a f2f1 codepre  pThe class codeAcode is incomplete because I should override codeoperatorcode and codeAAamp oldValuecode to solve some of these problems. As I understand it, the default implementation of these methods just copy the value of the members which is causing the destructor to be called twice on the same pointer values.p  pAm I right and what else am I missing In addition, do you know any good tutorial that explains this issuep

Negative 343 pI am inheriting an existing Sitecore implementation that has large folders of content all using the same template. Some of the folders contain literally hundreds of articles. Different folders should be of interest to different type of Personas. I would like to not have to go article by article setting the Personas and Profile properties for each individual page. Ideally I would like to enter the properties only once for an entire folder of articles. What is the best practice in a case like thisp  pShould I be creating a different template for each type of article Or is there a way to inherit these properties from a parent item in the content treep  pThanksp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pI had a conversation online with John West, CTO of Sitecore USA. Here are his suggestions to approach this problem. I thought of sharing them here since some other people might be interested in solving a similar problem.p  blockquote   pI dont know of any existing solution to inherit these values, but there are probably other approaches maybe similar to language fallback.p      pIf the number of templates is relatively small, I would probably go with the templating approach  turn the existing template into a base template for templates for all of the existing items, and update insert options accordingly. It wouldnt hurt to put these things in folders, but they wont inherit these values that way you could implement something that would inherit them as mentioned above. One of the benefits here is that you could update those details in standard values, which would apply to all items based on those templates.p      pAnother way would be to implement something like layout and security presets, but for these other values.p      pWhatever you do, make sure that when the user creates a new item, they can eaily apply these properties, or they get applied automatically.p      pAnother way would be to write a script that updates the existing items, but that doesnt help with future items unless you do something like a save handler to apply the same values automatically on creation. Maybe copy the values from that parent folder.p blockquote  pI liked the idea of adding a boolean field to the existing template that controls whether the item is supposed to copy the Profile values from its direct parent and then implement a save handler to do the copy when that field is set to true. So I asked John if there was documentation on how to build such handlers. Here is his kind replyp  blockquote   pThis explains some of the ways you can tap in to item creationchange to set your valuesp      pa hrefhttpwww.sitecore.netCommunityTechnicalBlogsJohnWestSitecoreBlogPosts201011InterceptingItemUpdateswithSitecore.aspxhttpwww.sitecore.netCommunityTechnicalBlogsJohnWestSitecoreBlogPosts201011InterceptingItemUpdateswithSitecore.aspxap      pI assume you could use an itemsaved event handler. I avoid itemcreated handlers because if my logic goes wrong, I want it to run again on the next save event. In your case, if these fields are empty, you probably want to set the value.p      pYou can use the factory to pass parameters to your event handler to avoid hardcoding. For example, you might pass the database name master abort the handler if the saved item is in a different database and a list of the affected template IDs. Then you can more easily add templates to the list in the future.p      pa hrefhttpwww.sitecore.netenCommunityTechnicalBlogsJohnWestSitecoreBlogPosts201102TheSitecoreASPNETCMSConfigurationFactory.aspxhttpwww.sitecore.netenCommunityTechnicalBlogsJohnWestSitecoreBlogPosts201102TheSitecoreASPNETCMSConfigurationFactory.aspxap      pHeres some information about eventsp      pa hrefhttpsdn.sitecore.netArticlesAPIUsing20Events.aspxhttpsdn.sitecore.netArticlesAPIUsing20Events.aspxap      pThis includes an example that uses a save handlerp      pa hrefhttpwww.sitecore.netCommunityTechnicalBlogsJohnWestSitecoreBlogPosts201006SitecoreSharedSourceNewsMoverCategorizesNewsbyDate.aspxhttpwww.sitecore.netCommunityTechnicalBlogsJohnWestSitecoreBlogPosts201006SitecoreSharedSourceNewsMoverCategorizesNewsbyDate.aspxap blockquote
Negative 343 pToday I was looking the latest exam of the local informatics olympiad and I found a interesting problem.

Informally, the number of inversions is the number of pairs that are out of order.

Could be problem in configuration file of NHibernate.p  pPrevious definition of the problem When I try to insert or update instance of CRResidence, the error about unsaved transient error occurs. Instance of CRResidenceRegion is completely initialized, including Id, so there is no problem. I have implemented Equal method on Id. I have tried to clear cache, but it wasnt helpful. When I change cascade to saveupdate, it works, but records of CRResidenceRegion are duplicated. One solution is that I read CRResidenceRegion from database in same session commented in code below before I save CRResidence, but this is not acceptable.p  pIt seems that NHibernate has propably lost reference to CRResidenceRegion and thinks that it is new created, but its not.p

Negative 343 pId like to show a different fragment in a TabHost, for every tab. But  it seems that theres no easy way to do this. TabHost can only accept  A. Views or B. Intents that launch Activities when the user selects a  tab. p  pGoing with A means that I have to initialize every fragment and load  them into container Views that are given to the TabHost. But I want  these fragments to load only when needed  when the user selects their  tab that is. p  pGoing with B means that I load the fragments into separate Activities  for each tab. But Id like the fragment to be able to reach the  original parent Activity, not just some shell Activity that hosts  them in a tab content. p  pAm I missing something Is there a way to manage fragments with  TabHost properlyp

Negative 343 pI learnt how to use container authentication with JDBC realm. I searched a lot on internet but I couldnt find anything on JSF authorization except the following article. a hrefhttpjava.syscon.comnode250254 relnofollowJSF authorizationap  pMy goal is to avoid access to protected pages using direct links and to showhide menu items  and form components based on the authenticated user privileges. The last part can be implemented using the rendered attribute of JSF tags  but before creating my own dirty and high coupled solution I wonder if there are some specific best practices or libraries that can help. in fact the number of components to be conditionally rendered is quite high and I wouldnt like to write a specific function for each of them. Perhaps I can create for each authenticated user a map with the names id of all the conditionally rendered components and a single function with a String parameter the unique nameid of the component. Is that a good idea  What alternatives do I have  I wouldnt like to add to the project other general purpose frameworks such as spring for using only a small part of them the security one. p  pThanks Filippo  p

Negative 343 pI have strong reason to believe that both functions rename and unlink are asynchronous, which, from my understanding, means that when the functions are called, the code below them are continued before it finishes its procedures on the filesystem. This is a problem for the internet app Ill explain below, because later code depends on these changes to already be set in stone. So, is there a way to make both synchronous, so that the code reader freezes when it hits these functions, until all of its tasks are fully carried out on the filesystemp  pHere is the code in deleteimage.php, which is called by ajax from another adminimages.phpthe latter will not be shownp  p  precode    foreach dirScan as key gt value          fileParts  explode., dirScan[key]         if issetfileParts[1]              if fileParts[1]  gif ampamp fileParts[1]  jpg ampamp fileParts[1]  png ampamp fileParts[1]  jpg                  unsetdirScan[key]                       else              unsetdirScan[key]                   dirScan  arrayvaluesdirScan       for thumbnail     file  galleries . currentGal .  . currentDir .  . dirScan[imageNum  1]     unlinkfile           for i  imageNum  1  1 i lt countdirScan i          thisFile  galleries . currentGal .  . currentDir .  . dirScan[i]         thisSplitFileName  explode., dirScan[i]         newName  galleries . currentGal .  . currentDir .  . thisSplitFileName[0]  1  . . . thisSplitFileName[1]         renamethisFile, newName            for large image     fileParts  explode., dirScan[imageNum  1]     file  galleries . currentGal .  . currentDir . large . fileParts[0] .

Sometimes it displays old names and files that were suppose to be deleted, and a simple page refresh gets rid of them. This seems to suggest that the above php script is running through all the code and spitting out echoed text to the mainfile before it completes its filesystem manipulation All of this other code is long and complicated, and hopefully unnecessary for the discussion at hand. p  pYoull notice, Ive tried a sleep function to halt the php script to hopefully give it time to finish. This is an ineligent, and problematic way of doing things, because I have to put a large amount of time to insure it works everytime, but I dont want the user to wait longer than she  he has to.p

Negative 343 pI have a .NET WCF service with a few operation contracts that takes a DateTimeOffset. The idea is to avoid any confusion with DST and time zones.p  pHowever I am in doubt that using DateTimeOffset is a good idea after all, since it is fairly nonstandard and would cause headaches for anyone trying to connect with, say, a Java application or a .NET application bound to an older .NET version.p  pAn alternative is to expect a UTC DateTime, but this introduces the risk that someone will forget to use UTC time and call the service with a local time. I could also expect a local time DateTime, since clients will always be in the same timezone, but this leaves some subtle, but classic, ambiguity around DST changes.p  pDoes anyone have headache stories with DateTimeOffset in a service interface or is it relatively unproblematic to use after allp

Negative 343 pIm somewhat new to WPF and the MVVM pattern.  Here is my situation.  My application looks similar to Outlook 2007.  There is a left navigation pane with a list of editors, and a right content pane where the editors will show up in tabs.  Some of my editors have a very similar look.  They will have a top pane with a grid of items to edit.  Once selecting an item, the bottom pane will will show a formstyle editor with text boxes, combo boxes, etc.  Id like to encapsulate the basic functionality of these editors in a base class.  But, from what Ive read, you cant inherit XAML.  One solution I saw someone mention is creating the base UserControl class that has no XAML only .cs file.  Then, each of my editors views could inherit off of it and incorporate the editor specific itemsparticularly the bottom edit pane.  Each of the editors will have their own view model, but they would also inherit off of a common view model base class.  Is this a good solution or is there a better way.p  pEDITp  pSo my next question is how  Ive created the following base class with no XAML that dynamically creates 3 rows.  The first row contains a codeDataGridcode.  The base class will define the grid but the subclasses will set the binding.  The second row simply contains a grid splitter.  And, the third row is empty.  This is where the specific editor will put its own user control.p  precodepublic class BaseEditor  UserControl    public BaseEditor        RowDefinition gridRow  new RowDefinition     RowDefinition splitterRow  new RowDefinition     RowDefinition editorRow  new RowDefinition      userControlsGrid.RowDefinitions.AddgridRow     userControlsGrid.RowDefinitions.AddsplitterRow     userControlsGrid.RowDefinitions.AddeditorRow      EditorGrid  new DataGrid     Grid.SetRowEditorGrid, 0     userControlsGrid.Children.AddEditorGrid      GridSplitter gridSplitter  new GridSplitter     Grid.SetRowgridSplitter, 1     userControlsGrid.Children.AddgridSplitter      AddChilduserControlsGrid     codepre  pThen, I have attempted to create a specific editor that inherits from BaseEditor.  I have set the base class in the cs file to BaseEditor, and I have also set the beginend tags in the xaml to BaseEditor.p  pI see the controls within the designer of the specific editor.  However, I soon see this is not what I expected.  If I start to add content in the specific editors XAML, it is not going in the third row.  So, I missing something.  In windows forms, you could create a Content region using attributes and the designer would only be able to edit that area.  How do I do a similar thing in WPF so that all of the content goes into the third rowp

Negative 343 pIm working on an iPhone application which requires a user to login to Facebook. However that is only to retrieve a  users friendslist, after that I wish to continue communication through my own XMPP server, I would like to automate the account creation to this server. p  pFor this I would need a username, which is pretty straighforward the facebook user id, however I would also need to create a password based on some sort of private key showing the user has logged in to Facebook. This key should be the same for any device logged in over any amount of time, Ive been looking at the Facebook API but could only find an access token, which I believe is different when the user logs in from a different device.p  pMy question Is there anything available from the Facebook API with these requirements Any suggestions for alternative solutions would be welcome too.p  pThanksp  pEditp  pExamplep  ol liUser uses the app for the first time on his iPhone, logs in with facebook and the app automatically creates an acount on my XMPP server, where the user ID is equal to the facebook ID and the password is something that shows the user has been logged into his facebook account.li liNow the user uses the app on his iPad, again logging into his facebook account, however already having an account on my XMPP server the same password must be generated from the data received from facebook.li ol  pStep 2 is the part which poses a problem for me, I need data that shows that the user has been logged into his account, and which is the same wherever and whenever he logs in, just so that the same password can be generated every time. I believe that if I use the accesstoken for this then this will change if the user for example doesnt log in for 60 days and starts using the app again, or maybe even when he logs into a different devicep  pTo clarify the XMPP server that Facebook offers is not to my needs, I need to be able to send other things besides chat messages and also need to be able to store messages so that new devices which log on can be synced to a proper state.p

Negative 343 pIm currently working on an app where a user can post logs to a project. However, it seems as if I have come across a problem and cannot seem to find the answer. The back button does not close the log activity after a user makes a post. Instead, it makes the app unresponsive the logcat from such an instance is at the bottom. However, clicking wait instead of force close resumes the app, but the back button still does not work. Below is the layout of the activity. Each view in the viewflipper is a different log for the project with several edittexts to fill in info and a button to post to the log. Originally, this was laid out where the current posts were displayed below the post buttons in a listview. At that point, the back button had full functionality. However, a listview inside a scrollview doesnt work so well, so it had to be changed to the sliding drawer with a listview whose adapter is changed each time the user flips between the logs. This is the point where the back button functionality was lost. At first I thought I was doing something wrong in my onKeyDown method, but after trying to debug it, modify it, and even remove it, I found it never gets called. Because this started occurring after I changed to a sliding drawer, my conclusion is that it has something to do with the sliding drawer. Any help with this would be much appreciated.p  pstrongEDITstrong After a thorough exploration of this problem, I have found that it is not just the back button that does this. The settings button and the search button both exhibit this behavior as well. The only button that exhibits correct functionality is the home button. However, functionality within the activity is not affected. I can still post, flip between the views, and view and edit posts.p  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingutf8gt ltTableLayout xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid     androidlayoutwidthfillparent     androidlayoutheightfillparent     androidbackgrounddrawableiphonebg gt      ltTableRow         androidlayoutwidthfillparent         androidlayoutheightwrapcontent         androidlayoutweight0         androidbackgrounddrawabletoolbargradient         androidgravitycentervertical gt          lt Header gt     ltTableRowgt      ltTableRow         androidlayoutwidthfillparent         androidlayoutheightwrapcontent         androidlayoutweight0 gt          lt Date gt     ltTableRowgt      ltTableRow         androidlayoutwidthfillparent         androidlayoutheightwrapcontent         androidlayoutweight0 gt          lt Tabs gt     ltTableRowgt      ltFrameLayout         xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid         androidlayoutwidthfillparent         androidlayoutheightfillparent         androidlayoutgravitycenter gt          ltTableLayout             xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid             androidlayoutwidthfillparent             androidlayoutheightfillparent             androidbackgrounddrawableiphonebg gt              ltTableRow                 androidlayoutwidthfillparent                 androidlayoutheightfillparent                 androidlayoutweight1 gt                  ltViewFlipper                     androidididViewFlipper01                     androidlayoutwidth0dip                     androidlayoutheightfillparent                     androidlayoutweight2 gt                      lt adding views to ViewFlipper gt                     lt ScrollView 1 gt                     lt ScrollView 2 gt                     lt ScrollView 3 gt                     lt ScrollView 4 gt                     lt ScrollView 5 gt                 ltViewFlippergt             ltTableRowgt         ltTableLayoutgt          ltSlidingDrawer             androidididdrawer             androidlayoutwidthfillparent             androidlayoutheightfillparent             androidcontentidanyPosts             androidhandleidhandle gt              ltButton                 androidididhandle                 androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent                 androidlayoutheightwrapcontent                 androidminHeight35dip                 androidbackgrounddrawableblackbtnbg                 androidtextDrag or Tap to View Posts                 androidtextColorFFFFFF                 androidtextStylebold gt              ltListView                 androidididanyPosts                 androidlayoutwidthfillparent                 androidlayoutheightfillparent                 androidpaddingLeft5dip                 androidpaddingRight5dip gt             ltListViewgt         ltSlidingDrawergt     ltFrameLayoutgt  ltTableLayoutgt codepre  pThe extent of the code dealing with the sliding drawer, located in my onCreate methodp  precode        final SlidingDrawer slide  SlidingDrawer findViewByIdR.id.drawer         final Button btnDownloads  Button findViewByIdR.id.handle         slide.setOnDrawerOpenListenernew OnDrawerOpenListener               Override             public void onDrawerOpened                  btnDownloads.setTextDrag or Tap to Close Posts                                slide.setOnDrawerCloseListenernew OnDrawerCloseListener               Override             public void onDrawerClosed                  btnDownloads.setTextDrag or Tap to View Posts                               slide.animateOpen codepre  pThe extent of the code dealing with the listviewp  precode    ListView listToFill  ListView findViewByIdR.id.anyPosts     listToFill.setAdapterlistViewAdapter codepre  pLogcatp  precode0607 135144.394 IInputDispatcher1464 Application is not responding AppWindowToken40cd7758 tokenHistoryRecord40534788 uda.projectlogging.RadioGroup  Window40ae0a88 uda.projectlogginguda.projectlogging.RadioGroup pausedfalse.  10009.8ms since event, 10009.4ms since wait started 0607 135144.394 IWindowManager1464 Input event dispatching timed out sending to uda.projectlogginguda.projectlogging.RadioGroup 0607 135144.444 IProcess1464 Sending signal.

I know how to make the MySQL searches however does anyone have suggestions on how to produce the results in the search bar wo reloading the page.

When I try to set them equal to each other I get issuesp  precodeclass B      public     B B     Bconst B ampOverloading     Bamp Boperatorconst B ampOverloading     vectorltAgt storesa class A contains ints, doubles etc. I filled this with     pointers to class A     void MrClean   BB  BB       MrClean    BBconst B ampOverloading        forsizet i0 iltstoresa.size i                storesA[i]new AOverloading.storesa[i]          BBamp Boperatorconst B ampOverloading          ifthisampOverloading          MrClean            forsizet i0 iltstoresa.size i                          storesA[i]new AOverloading.storesa[i]                          return this     void BMrClean       forsizet i0 iltstoresA.size i              delete storesA[i]         int main          B pnew B        B qnew B         fill some stuff. this is just random stuff I am making up        qp compiles then Kaboom at this line         delete p         delete q       return 0    codepre  pI guess I have some conceptual gap still on the assignment operator. I have read many tutorials and I feel like I am doing what they say...p  pAlso another question, say in this example I also had a member int x in B. Since I called the copy constructor and overloaded the assignment operator do I have to explicitly call xOverloading.x I mean technically I am overriding the default copy constructor no However x is just a regular plain old int. p

Negative 343 pNot sure why, but some functions arent working like they should. I just got into using JavaScript so my debugging skills are lacking. I just added a few lines to this from its previous version to implement new features and since then, it hasnt worked like it used to.  I used jsBin or whatever its called and it told me a few things but I dont know if it is legitimate advice or not.p  pOne of the things it told me was that I use setID out of scope, I guess because I use it out of the for statement But its still in the same function. If thats a problem, how do I declare it so I can use it Although that part works fine.p  pAnother was that I should compare metroID and 0 using  instead of . Not really sure what the difference is, to be completely honest.p  pAnyway, the problem Im having is that the function setSubDesc isnt being called on the page load anymore. It was before I added that code. Another problem Im having is that changing the radio buttons paytype isnt calling the change in the Javascript. If I move some things around, certain parts work like they should. But I really dont understand why the placement of things makes a difference.p  pAnyAll help is greatly appreciated. p  pWhat I addedp  precodesetFundSelect  function setFundSelect      var orgID  orgfundid.val     fspan.hide     fdiv.hide     fundraiserid.removeClassrequired      for var i0 i lt orgs.length i          if orgs[i][1]  orgID              var setID  i                    if orgs[setID][4]  1          fundraiserid.addClassrequired         fspan.show         fdiv.show         fundraiserid.children.remove          for var i0 i lt fundraisers.length i              if fundraisers[i][0]  orgID                  if fundraisers[i][4]                      selectedHTML  selectedselected                  else                      selectedHTML                                    fundraiserid.appendltoption valuefundraisers[i][2] selectedHTMLgtfundraisers[i][3]lt optiongt                             codepre  pThe full scope of Javascript in the pagep  precodeltscript typetextjavascriptgt var orgs  [] var fundraisers  []  function pageInit       ltphp do            if rowrsOrg[ID]  GET[fundID]               selected  true              selectedMetroID  rowrsOrg[metroID]          else               selected  false               gt         orgs.push[ltphp echo rowrsOrg[metroID] gt,ltphp echo rowrsOrg[ID] gt, ltphp echo addslashesrowrsOrg[orgname] gt, lt echo selected gt, ltphp echo rowrsOrg[iffund] gt]     ltphp  while rowrsOrg  mysqlfetchassocrsOrg gt      ltphp do            if rowrsFund[ID]  GET[refID]               selected2  true              selectedOrgID  rowrsFund[orgfundID]          else               selected2  false           gt         fundraisers.push[ltphp echo rowrsFund[orgfundID] gt, ltphp echo rowrsFund[refID] gt, ltphp echo rowrsFund[ID] gt, ltphp echo addslashesrowrsFund[firstname] gt ltphp echo addslashesrowrsFund[lastname] gt, lt echo selected2 gt]     ltphp  while rowrsFund  mysqlfetchassocrsFund gt      metroid.changefunction          setOrgSelect           orgfundid.changefunction          setFundSelect           subscriptionvalue.changefunction          setSubDesc           metroid.appendltoption value0gtPlease Choose...lt optiongt     metroid.appendltoption value1 lt if selectedMetroID  1  echo selectedselected gtgtSt. Louislt optiongt     metroid.appendltoption value2 lt if selectedMetroID  2  echo selectedselected gtgtCharlottelt optiongt      setOrgSelect     setFundSelect     setSubDesc      input[namepaytype].changefunction         ppac.removeClassrequired         cc.removeClassrequired         cccvv2.removeClassrequired         name.removeClassrequired         street.removeClassrequired         zip.removeClassrequired          if input[namepaytype]checked.val  cc              paytypeccdiv.show             paytypecodediv.hide              cc.addClassrequired             cccvv2.addClassrequired             name.addClassrequired             street.addClassrequired             zip.addClassrequired          else              paytypecodediv.show             paytypeccdiv.hide              ppac.addClassrequired                  .submitdivs.show        function setOrgSelect      var metroID  metroid.val      ospan.show     orgfundid.children.remove      for var i0 i lt orgs.length i          if orgs[i][0]  metroID              if orgs[i][3]                  selectedHTML  selectedselected              else                  selectedHTML                            orgfundid.appendltoption valueorgs[i][1] selectedHTMLgtorgs[i][2]lt optiongt                 function setFundSelect      var orgID  orgfundid.val     fspan.hide     fdiv.hide     fundraiserid.removeClassrequired      for var i0 i lt orgs.length i          if orgs[i][1]  orgID              var setID  i                    if orgs[setID][4]  1          fundraiserid.addClassrequired         fspan.show         fdiv.show         fundraiserid.children.remove          for var i0 i lt fundraisers.length i              if fundraisers[i][0]  orgID                  if fundraisers[i][4]                      selectedHTML  selectedselected                  else                      selectedHTML                                    fundraiserid.appendltoption valuefundraisers[i][2] selectedHTMLgtfundraisers[i][3]lt optiongt                              function setSubDesc      var subVal  subscriptionvalue.val     if subVal  10          monthlysub.show         yearlysub.hide      else          monthlysub.hide         yearlysub.show       ltscriptgt codepre

Negative 343 pIn platforms like Javascript, AS3 and Python which support and recommend untyped data arrays by default, arrays are usually the simplest and most effective way of storing arbitrary user data in memory. tabular data, data from CSVs, data from JSON, etcp  p.NET however likes everything in a stronglytyped format you just cant dump anything into a codeListltobjectgtcode array, although it works, it will be slower and clumsier to handle type checks, type casting every usage. So usually you end up defining the data schema as a class, with properties corresponding to the columns, and storing data in instances of that class. p  pSo what are the recommended methods of storing arbitrary data in memory, especially when the schema keeps upgrading such as CSV or JSON that you cannot hardcode for at the time of development.p  pstrongEditstrong Such data may include numbers intfloat, strings, dates, times, units, geospatial data, geometric data, embedded files, essentially everything a MySQL database or JSON file could store.p  pstrongEditstrong While in memory, this data can and would be used for every kind of processing calculations to generate charts, string processing to search for data by substrings, number crunching algorithms for geospatial3D data, etc, optimization algorithms that validate dirty data and optimize redundant data, etc.p

Negative 343 pIm wondering if its possible to introduce type variables within the scope of a method in Java. That is, limiting their scope within the method body.p  pHowever, rather than trying to describe the problem in the abstract, let my illustrate with my concrete problem. I have a couple of classes that look a bit like thisp  precodepublic class Settings      public static abstract class SettingltTgt          public T value         public abstract T fallbackvalue           private final ListltSettingltgtgt settings  codepre  pI now want to write a function, in codeSettingscode, for setting the value of all the Settings to their fallback values as provided by the abstract method. My first thought would be to do it like thisp  precodepublic void reset      forSettingltgt setting  settings         setting.value  setting.fallbackvalue  codepre  pHowever, on second thought it is rather obvious why this does not work the capture of codeltgtcode for setting.value is not the same capture as for codesetting.fallbackvaluecode. Ergo, I need some way to unify the captures. It is empossibleem to solve it like thisp  precodeprivate static ltTgt void reset1SettingltTgt s      s.value  setting.fallbackvalue   public void reset      forSettingltgt setting  settings         reset1setting  codepre  pThe explicit type variable codeltTgtcode for codereset1code unifies the captures conveniently, but its obviously the ugliest thing in the world to introduce this function, pollute the namespace, clutter the screen and make the code less readable merely to satisfy the type system.p  pIs there no way I can do this within the body of coderesetcode What Id like to do is simply something like thisp  precodepublic void reset      forSettingltgt setting  settings          ltTgt              SettingltTgt foo  setting             foo.value  foo.fallbackvalue                codepre  pIts not the prettiest thing in the world, but at least to my eyes it is far less strainful than the variant above. Alas, its not possible but what is possible, thenp

Negative 343 pIn my project we have a piece of code like this p  precode raw data consists of 4 ints unsigned char data[16] int i1, i2, i3, i4 i1  intdata i2  intdata  4 i3  intdata  8 i4  intdata  12 codepre  pI talked to my tech lead that this code may not be portable since its trying to cast a codeunsigned charcode to a codeintcode which usually has a more strict alignment requirement. But tech lead says thats all right, most compilers remains the same pointer value after casting, and I can just write the code like this.p  pTo be frank, Im not really convinced. After researching, I find some people against use of pointer castings like above, e.g., a hrefhttpswww.securecoding.cert.orgconfluencedisplaycplusplusEXP36CPP.Donotconvertpointersintomorestrictlyalignedpointertypesherea and a hrefhttpwww.informit.comguidescontent.aspxgcplusplusampseqNum548herea.p  pSo here are my questionsp  ol liIs it REALLY safe to dereference the pointer after casting in a real projectli liIs there any difference between Cstyle casting and codereinterpretcastcodeli liIs there any difference between C and Cli ol

Negative 343 pI have written a memory allocator to solve a problem with the speed of the default one in C mingw.p  pTo do this Ive overloaded global new and delete. All the requests im getting through are being correctly allocated with memory of the correct sizes but im still getting segmentation faults. These faults seem to be about the use of vectors.p  pI assume these vectors would be covered by the global override of new and delete but I maybe wrong. So what im asking is would I need to have an stl allocator that works off of my memory allocator or is it likely some other problem using global new and delete that I have overlookedp

Negative 343 pHi I need some advice from professionals,p  pI am working on project that basic idea is to create system to display the lists of people. The list would be available through website with some js as well as on mobile device. The data on mySQL. There would be some updates to the website to the specific person. This update would use restful api like twitter pushed by the person through their phone. There would be mobile version of the system where other users would check the peoples update. p  pYou would say its a kind of social network but with limited requirements.p  pSo far I come up with creating a hybrid app for any mobile using phonegap but I am not sure if this is right. Ill start with iOS but may also do Android for better outcome. Still not surre how would I manage the database on mobile. I am also working on the website, but shall I make it suitable for mobile view on serverp  pQuestions How would you improve this idea Did I choose the right toolsp  pThank you for the advice.p

Most deployment software Ive found uses FTP, and if there is an update made on the live server some of our scripts generate occasional code changes the FTP seems to blow away the live changes if the Repository has the same modified file what would otherwise be a merge conflict.

Negative 343 pIn google app engine i have created my own user API appropriately called user so it doesnt interfere with the google app engine API users. Like most multiuser websites, two versions of the site are available to the user depending on whether or not they are logged in. Thus is created a file called router.py with the following codep  precodeimport webapp2  from lib import user import guest import authorized  if user.isLoggedIn     app  webapp2.WSGIApplicationauthorized.WSGIHandler,debugTrue else     app  webapp2.WSGIApplicationguest.WSGIHandler,debugTrue codepre  pthe codeguestcode and codeauthorizedcode modules are formated like your conventional application script for examplep  precodeimport webapp2 import os  class MainPagewebapp2.RequestHandler     def getself,random         self.response.out.writeauthorized random  WSGIHandler  [., MainPage] codepre  pThus the router file easily selects which WSGIApplication url director to use by grabbing the WSGIHandler variable from either the guest or authorized module. However the user must close all tabs for the router to detect a change in the codeisLoggedIncode function. If you log in it does not recognize that you have done so until every tab is closed. I have two possible reasons for thisp  ol lipcodeisLoggedIncode uses os.environ[HTTPCOOKIE] to retrieve cookies and see if a user is logged in, it then checks the cookie data against the database to make sure they are valid cookie. Possibly this could have an error where the cookies on the servers end arent being refreshed when the page is Maybe because im not getting the cookies from codeself.requestcode.pli lipIs it possible that in order to conserve frontend hours or something that google app engine caches the scripts from the server with in the servers memcache i Doubt it but i am at a loss for the reason for this behavior.pli ol  pThanks in advance for the helpp  h1Edith1  pUpon more testing i found that as suspected the router.py file responded correctly and directed the user based in logged in when a comment was added to it. This seems to indicate caching.p  h1Edit 2h1  pI have uncovered some more information on the WSHI Applicationp  blockquote   pThe Python runtime environment caches imported modules between requests on a single web server, similar to how a standalone Python application loads a module only once even if the module is imported by multiple files. Since WSGI handlers are modules, they are cached between requests. CGI handler scripts are only cached if they provide a main routine otherwise, the CGI handler script is loaded for every request.p blockquote  pI wonder how efficient to refresh the WSGI module somehow. This would undoubtably task the server, but solve my problem. Again, this seems to be a partial solution.p  h1Edit 3h1  pAgain, any attempt to randomize a comment in the router.py file is ineffective. The id statement looking for user login is completely overlooked and the WSGIApplication is set to its original state. Im not yet sure if this is due to the module cache in the webapp2 module or thanks to the module cache on the user API. I suspect the latter.p

Negative 343 pIve seen similar posts regarding this kind of thing but Id like personal help with my query.p  pWhat we have is a media site that, when a media item is selected, displays three related media items in a sidebar. The items should display two items with a later date and one with an earlier date than the currently chosen one. If there are not two with a later date, show just one with a later date and two with an earlier date. If the currently chosen media is already the most recent having no related media with a later date, then just show the three with earlier dates. Of course, these three results need to be the three closest in date to the currently selected media.p  pI have a query that works almost perfectlyp  precode    query       SELECT         media.,          mediaseries.seriesname,          mediabooks.bookname,          mediabooks.bookshortname       FROM media      LEFT JOIN mediaseries ON media.series  mediaseries.id     LEFT JOIN mediabooks ON media.book  mediabooks.id      WHERE media.date gt mediadate AND media.series  seriesid     AND media.id ltgt mediaid2     ORDER BY ABSDATEDIFFmedia.date, mediadate LIMIT 2     UNION     SELECT         media.,          mediaseries.seriesname,          mediabooks.bookname,          mediabooks.bookshortname      FROM media      LEFT JOIN mediaseries ON media.series  mediaseries.id     LEFT JOIN mediabooks ON media.book  mediabooks.id      WHERE media.date lt mediadate AND media.series  seriesid     AND media.id ltgt mediaid2     ORDER BY ABSDATEDIFFmedia.date, mediadate      ORDER BY date DESC LIMIT 3      codepre  pThe first codeSELECTcode gets up to two items having a later date, then, using codeUNIONcode, the second codeSELECTcode gets any items having an earlier date.  Finally, the codeLIMIT 3code at the end makes sure we only get three rows overall.p  pThe only flaw with this query that I can see is that if the currently chosen media is the OLDEST meaning it has no related media with earlier dates, then only two results will display, because the first codeSELECTcode limits to 2 and the second codeSELECTcode returns nothing.p  pI need the first codeSELECTcode to return 3 rows only if the second codeSELECTcode returns zero rows.

Negative 343 pHi guys a very young student here. Few days in learning now, and it is time to start getting the code looking neat, readable and to any and all standards likely already in place that i am unaware of before i develop some bad habits The tutorials i am following do not mention proper practices when it comes to readability, format, notation, etc. Basically anything on how to make the code a delight to go through instead of a nightmare. I of course have my own personal preferences but i am looking for more information and advice on the most widely used formatting and notation practices. p  pHowever, information is appearing to be exceedingly difficult to obtain regarding these and other relevant subjects. So much so that i am not sure there are even widely accepted style standards to follow.

Negative 343 pI wrote a code to get the text file names in a directory, get the length of the articles which are number of words in article, and the two steps seem to work well, and the outputs are what I wanted.

For example, get the number of text files whose lengths are within a range like 03, or get the maximum length of all the articles. There are no outputs of the corresponding codes.

Negative 343 pI have a problem with the following PythonDjango code in a multiprocess environment.  It tries to update an InnoDB table as if it were a queue, popping the top value.  It works fine until the load reaches a certain level and multiple processes are in this code at the same time.  A deadlock occurs when one process holds the table for delete, and another process tries to update the table.p  pSomething I previously didnt know about InnoDB is that the index is separate from the table, so one process can have a lock the table and be waiting for a lock on the index, and another process can have the opposite, creating the deadlock.  This seems to be happening with the UPDATEDELETE deadlock in the code below.p  pIn a nutshell the code starts by updating a single row LIMIT 1 in the table, preventing any other process from updating the same row.  It then selects that row to retrieve the other contents, performs some work, and then deletes that row from the table.p  precodeclassmethod transaction.commitmanually def popcls, uniqueid     Retrieves the next item and removes it from the queue.     transaction.commit     This has the side effect of clearing the object cache      if cls.objects.all.filteruniqueidisnullTrue.count  0  return None      sql  UPDATE queue SET uniqueidd  uniqueid     sql   WHERE uniqueid IS NULL     sql   ORDER BY id LIMIT 1     cursor  connection.cursor     try         cursor.executesql         row  cursor.fetchone     except OperationalError, oe     deadlock, retry later         transaction.rollback         return None      If an item is available, it is now marked with our processid.       Retrieve any items with this process id     items  cls.objects.all.filterprocessidprocessid     if lenitems  0      No items available         transaction.rollback         return None     top  items[0]       there should only be one item      ... perform some other actions here ...     top.delete         This item is deleted from the queue     transaction.commit     return item codepre  pAs mentioned above, the deadlock occurs when two processes are running this same code at the same time.

Negative 343 pI have created a simple python application to detect changes in a set of words. Now I need an executable file of my script. Since I use python 3.3 the only way I found was using cxFreeze. I have created my setup file according to the documentation presented by cxFreeze website, and it seems to work. The thing is while it is creating the files in the bin folder python.exe crashes, there is only a windows error saying python.exe stopped working. In the lines printed to command prompt I can see that the crash has occurred after copying python33.dll. This I can confirm by comparing the copied file and the original file. Still, an exe file is created which also crashes when I run it. Tracing it, I found out that the exe file crashes when it tries to get a zipimporter instance, giving the error cannot get zipimporter instance. I have a windows 7 64 bit, python 3.3.2 64 bit, and cxFreeze 4.3.1 64 bit. I also have a windows 7 32 bit on a virtual machine with python 3.3.2 32 bit and cxFreeze 4.3.1 32 bit. To my knowledge both Linux and windows users have this problem but only Linux users seem to have a solution Maybe I didnt find the solution to my problem, but I have spent two days looking. I would be really grateful if you can help.p

Negative 343 pis it possible to display an icon inside a DropdownButton for each element Im new to gwtbootsrap and dont know how to do. I use gwtbootstrap2.0.4.0.p
Negative 343 pI have three View Controllers A, B, C that are displayed when user clicks on Tab Bar item. When the user clicks on the third Tab Bar item, the C View Controller is displayed. The problem is that when third Tab Bar is selected it triggers a function that does a bunch of calculations and creates UI elements and I would like to display an Activity Indicator while those tasks are being done.p  pRight now I have a situation where that time consuming function blocks the main thread, so when user clicks the third Tab Bar item the UI freezes and the C View Controller is displayed when the time consuming function has done its job. But I would like to display the background of C View Controller with a spinner, while the function executes. So I tried to move the time consuming function to a new thread, but I cant get it to work.p  pIn my CViewController.m in code voidviewDidLoadcode I havep  precodeactivityView  [[UIActivityIndicatorView alloc] initWithActivityIndicatorStyleUIActivityIndicatorViewStyleGray] activityView.frame  CGRectMake0, 0, 35, 35 activityView.center  self.view.center [self.view addSubviewactivityView] [activityView startAnimating]  [NSThread detachNewThreadSelectorselectorthirdTabClicked toTargetself withObjectnil] codepre  pThen comes the function code voidthirdTabClickedcodep  precodeBunch of code here...

Maybe it has got something to do with the fact that I have a custom class for UITabBarControllerDelegate, so the codethirdTabClickedcode is actually called from there. So my TabBarControllerDelegate.m looks like thisp  precodevoidtabBarControllerUITabBarController tabBarController didSelectViewControllerUIViewController viewController   if [viewController respondsToSelectorselectorsecondTabBarClicked]              [idviewController secondTabBarClicked]   if [viewController respondsToSelectorselectorthirdTabClicked]      [idviewController thirdTabClicked]   codepre

Negative 343 pIm surprised I cant google my answer here... it seems no one else is having the issue.p  pWhen you run the meteor service the js, html, etc. is packaged in the .meteorlocalbuild folder, but it appears to exclude stuff that isnt js or html. I have a folder called magicsets and one called magicimgs and neither are in the localbuild folder. This is obviously why, when i attempt to use fs to readfile, it fails to find the file magicsetsM14.jsonp  pI tried putting the magicsets folder into a folder named private, but that didnt accomplish anything.p  pHow do I make files accessible locally to my server via FS and how do I make files accessible publically to my server via raw urlsp  pIm sure Im missing something very simple, because there are lots of more complicated questions and answers on SO, yet there is no answer for this.

Negative 343 pIm working on an application for a motion tracking device and have discovered some odd behavior that got me curious. The device SDK consists of three DLLs, one of them the main referenced DLL being used in the application nonnative, and the other two native.p  pThe application has three main actors, the Controller connection between device and application, Listener receives tracking information and an endless stream of Frame objects the data the Listener receives. All these items are disposable, in turn I believe they use unmanaged resources.p  pIf I do not remove the listener from the controller and then dispose of the controller, the application will crash on subsequent startup. This behavior is sporadic, it might happened at the second, third or later startup.p  pAlthough I am making sure I am disposing the objects, Im still very curious what logic or lack of logic can cause this type of behavior. Because I expect all objects to be disposed when an executable stops running.p  pCould the device drivers hold onto a reference And what would be the best way to troubleshoot this So the question is strongnotstrong how to dispose, but what wouldcould cause this, and why and how can I Sherlock Holmes this.p  pMore informationp  ul liNo exceptions li liAttaching a debugger doesnt provide more informationli ul

Negative 343 pThis question is not a doubt, in truth is a tip.p  pDid you know that a session EJB reinjected all dependencies before each business method call Well, I didnt know until few minutes ago and it gave me a big headache.p  pI thought that the dependency injection occur only in creation of instance, but, it is no truth. Specification of EJB 3.1  saysp  pIf a session bean makes use of dependency injection, the container injects these references after the bean instance is created, and before any business methods are invoked on the bean instance. Section 4.3.2p  pSomehow this definition can give the Stateless Session Bean the capacity of have a conversational state, that exactly is what i needed. For example, if you  inject in a SLSB a SessionScoped bean independently of which instance of the pool process your request the SessionScoped bean always will be compliance with session of the current client. In others words, there is no possibility of the SLSB instance to have a SessionScoped bean of another client.p  pThis enables that a SLSB receives a logged user as a instance field through Inject without causes any problem if two users use same instance of SLSB alternately. For examplep  precodeStateless public class StatelessSessionBean     Inject     LoggedInUser     protected User loggedInUserSessionScoped      public void test         System.out.printlnejbthis         System.out.printlnuserthis.loggedInUser       codepre  pThen, the result of various invocations of test method is thisp  precodeUser 1 invoke 170220,800 INFO  [stdout] http0.0.0.080805 ejbAccessControlBean406189 170220,801 INFO  [stdout] http0.0.0.080805 userUser 1  User 2 invoke 170256,227 INFO  [stdout] http0.0.0.080808 ejbAccessControlBean406189 170256,228 INFO  [stdout] http0.0.0.080808 userUser 2  User 2 invoke 170324,376 INFO  [stdout] http0.0.0.080808 ejbAccessControlBean406189 170324,378 INFO  [stdout] http0.0.0.080808 userUser 2  User 1 invoke 170324,517 INFO  [stdout] http0.0.0.080806 ejbAccessControlBean1c05227 170324,518 INFO  [stdout] http0.0.0.080806 userUser 1  User 1 invoke 170424,045 INFO  [stdout] http0.0.0.080801 ejbAccessControlBean406189 170424,047 INFO  [stdout] http0.0.0.080801 userUser 1  User 2 invoke 170424,179 INFO  [stdout] http0.0.0.080808 ejbAccessControlBean1c05227 170424,179 INFO  [stdout] http0.0.0.080808 userUser 2 codepre  pNote that even calling the same instance the field loggedInUser correctly varies according to the user who invoked the method.p

Currently I am benchmarking my routines for univariate and bivariate polynomial evaluation against their codenumpycode counterparts.p  pIn the univariate routine I use a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiHorner27smethod relnofollowHorners methoda as does codenumpy.polynomial.polynomial.polyvalcode. I have observed that the factor by which the Fortran routine is faster than the codenumpycode counterpart increases as the order of the polynomial increases.p  pIn the bivariate routine I use Horners method twice. First in y and then in x. Unfortunately I have observed that for increasing polynomial order, the codenumpycode counterpart catches up and eventually surpasses my Fortran routine. As codenumpy.polynomial.polynomial.polyval2dcode uses an approach similar to mine, I consider this second observation to be strange.p  pI am hoping that this result stems forth from my inexperience with Fortran and codef2pycode. Might someone have any clue why the univariate routine always appears superior, while the bivariate routine is only superior for low order polynomialsp  pstrongEDITstrong Here is my latest updated

However the SVG rendering looks much better, so where possible id like that to be preferred.p  pDoes MathJax have anything built in to support this It seems it can fallback from MML to HTML but not SVG to HTML.

I have a list with the password in it, I then take the users input and place it in an empty class. Then compare that class to the one with the password in it, if it matches it will return good. However Ive only been able to do this using one digit. How would allow for the user to use multiple integers And is this an efficient way of doing this sort of thing Is there are quicker more efficient method Thanks. p  precodeclass KeyCodeobject       def accessself         roomcode  [1]         print Before you enter you must provide the room code          attempt  []         code  intrawinputgtgt         attempt.appendcode         if attempt  roomcode              print Good         else               return death  class BoxingroomKeyCode       def enterself          print This is the boxing studio          return Gymnastroom codepre
Negative 343 pI use a hrefhttpwww.yiiframework.com relnofollowyiia framework that implements Active Record pattern as ORM base. It has CActiveRecord class that is a table wrapper class with attributes reflecting table columns. So each object of this class represents a database row.p  pa hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiActiverecordpattern relnofollowWikia says about Active Record patternp  blockquote   pActive record is an approach to accessing data in a databasep blockquote  pandp  blockquote   pA database table or view is wrapped into a class. Thus, an object instance is tied to a single row in the table.p blockquote  pSo far so good.p  pBut where should I put complex raw sql query that retrieves statistics data for examplep  pAnd, more generally, where should I put methods that retrieve some data that can not be an active record object like data retrieved with aggregation queries or if I knowingly do not want to retrieve an object but an array instead for examplep

Negative 343 pIm writing an application which requires me to embed .aspx pages into a dll. Previously I had a httphandler process all these pages and I built them up line by line in code. I have learned that I can actually use the codeVirtualPathProvidercode to serve up the embedded content. With the layout and what I am wanting to achieve Im having a little trouble.p  pWhat I had previously with the httphandlers was one dll project and one website project within the solution. The website project was totally empty apart from a web.config. The only alteration to this was the standard httphandler section pointing all website calls to my dll project which then served up the pages that it contained or passed the request back to IIS if the page didnt exist in my dll.p  pThis is what Im trying to achieve now but using codeVirtualPathProvidercode instead. I still want literally nothing within the website project but I cant seem to get the http request to go across to the dll project. Ive got the MSDN example working perfectly within its own project everything is in one web project, what Im trying to do is split them out.p  pIs this even possible Id presume it is but I cant find any examples anywhere, everyone wants to use this in the one project and not split them out.p  pThe idea is to allow minimal setup by the client, the first one was installed by dropping the dll in the Bin directory and then adding 3 lines to the web.config and that was it.p

Negative 343 pI am trying to learn Knockout while building a fairly complex dynamic form which is styled using the jQuery plugin Uniform JS. Since Knockout is dynamically building parts of the form on the fly I need to make sure Uniform JS keeps up and styles the dynamically generated form elements. p  pAfter some searching I found a blog post titled a hrefhttpwww.codinginsight.comknockoutjsknockouts relnofollowKnockout JS knockoutsa by Mikhail Temkine explaining how to write a custom Knockout binding to solve the problem with Uniform styled checkboxes. The custom binding looks like thisp  precodeko.bindingHandlers.checkedUniform       init function element, valueAccessor          ko.bindingHandlers.checked.initelement, valueAccessor     ,     update function element, valueAccessor          ko.bindingHandlers.checked.updateelement, valueAccessor         .uniform.updateelement       codepre  pThe simplified HTML looks something like thisp  precodeltul databindforeach itemsgt     ltli databindtext name, click root.editItem, css bold boldedgtltligt ltulgt ltdiv databindwith selectedItemgt     Edit list item ltinput databindvalue name gt     Make it bold ltinput typecheckbox databindcheckedUniform bolded gt ltdivgt codepre  pThe custom binding apparently uses the codeuniform.updatecode method which is supposed to refresh the state of the styled checkboxes. Unfortunately it isnt working. The checkboxes are styled according to the selected Uniform design template, but as soon as the Knockout template is rerendered in this case when codeselectedItemcode changes the indicator showing whether the checkbox is ticked or not is lost. The checkboxes are still functional, you can click them to toggle their state, its just that they always show up as unchecked.p  pI have created a simple jsFiddle to demonstrate the problemp  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.nettomaseklundRaSpK1 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.nettomaseklundRaSpK1ap

Negative 343 pIve been looking at many sites on how to upload images using drag amp drop  apparently the technique is using ajax and html5 .

Someone to helpp  pThe main issue would be how to make the call , probably to the file .php that will send the file  image  by  POST or some other way I do not know .p  pFor me , ideally the first example seems simple and functional .

Negative 343 pI got some troubles with the authentication in CakePHP 2.4. I baked a simple App to create a login. I did everything like in the book Auth and Tutorial. But only sha1 worked. But not sha256 or md5. After searching and testing I came to a solution where I had to change the example code in the book and now it works. But I think, this is not the proper solution.p  pI did the following in the AppControllerp  precodeAppusesController, Controller     class AppController extends Controller      public components  array         Session,         Auth gt array             authenticate gt array                 Form gt array                     passwordHasher gt array                         className gt Simple,                         hashType gt sha256                                                                   codepre  pI tested this with md5, sha1 and sha256. No problem. Login works if the passwords are hashed appropriately.p  pBut I noticed, that adding a user strongonly works with sha1strong, because this is the default hash. My User Models beforeSafe function was this from the bookp  precodeAppusesSimplePasswordHasher, ControllerComponentAuth class User extends AppModel    public function beforeSaveoptions  array      if issetthisgtdata[thisgtalias][password]          passwordHasher  new SimplePasswordHasher           thisgtdata[thisgtalias][password]  passwordHashergthash               thisgtdata[thisgtalias][password]                     return true     codepre  pI thought, that the setting in the AppController is enough, to change the SimplePasswordHasher in this area too. But as it seems, its not enough. So I changed it to thisp  precodethisgtdata[thisgtalias][password]  passwordHashergthash     thisgtdata[thisgtalias][password]  codepre  pto thisp  precodethisgtdata[thisgtalias][password]  Securityhash     thisgtdata[thisgtalias][password], sha256, true  codepre  pNow everything works like a charm.

Negative 343 pI work on a couple of different programs and packages in Python. They are each developed in their own Git repository, but frequently need to import modules defined in other packages. For instance, during development, the directory structure looks something likep  precodesrc  projecta     client.py     server.py     packagea         init.py         module.py  projectb     packageb        init.py        othermodule.py     packagec         init.py         thirdmodule.py  projectc      server1.py      server2.py      packaged      packagee      packagef codepre  pWhen they are all installed, they work fine they are all installed such that each package is in your Python path, and you can import from them as you need.p  pHowever, in development, I want the development version of each of these to be in my Python path, not the installed version. When making changes, I dont want to have to install each package that Im changing to test it, I want the changes to take effect immediately. That means my Python path needs to include the directories codeprojectacode, codeprojectbcode, etc.p  pOur current solution is just to have an environment.bash in the top level, which you source in your shell and it sets codePYTHONPATHcode. That works OK, but I frequently forget to do so since this is a client server application, with communications between servers, I need to have at least four windows open to different VMs to run this, and it happens pretty often that I forget to source environment.bash in at least one of those, leading me to try debugging strange behavior until I realize Im importing the wrong things.p  pAnother solution would be to set codesys.pathcode from within the top level client.py or server.py. This would work fine for launching them directly, but I would also need the path set up for running tools like Pylint or Sphinx, which that solution wouldnt cover. Id also need a way to distinguish between running from source when I want the path to include code.code and code..projectbcode and running the installed version which should use the standard path without modification.p  pAnother choice would be to have a Makefile which sets up codePYTHONPATHcode appropriately for various targets like codemake runservercode, codemake lintcode, codemake doccode, and so on. Thats OK for those targets, which dont require any options, but would be inconvenient for running the client, which takes arguments. codemake runclient ARGSfoo barcode is a fairly cumbersome way to invoke it.p  pIs there any common way of setting up the Python path during development so that both my executables and tools like Pylint and Sphinx can pick it up appropriately, without interfering with how it will behave when installedp

Negative 343 pI am trying to implement a somewhat complicated function and would like to avoid recycling code when all I need is to divide it into to appropriate statements. p  pI have a form for adding and editing content. If the user wishes to add new content the form is empty and after he provides all the required input the input is inserted into the database the form calls the save function and gives codenewcode as argument. One of the inputs is an image. The image is only required when the user is adding new content. In this scenario my function works like thisp  precodefunction savemethod      if method  new      1. collect input      2. check if image was provided ifFILES[userfile][tmpname]          2.1 upload original image        2.2 create and upload thumb to thumb folder        2.3 create and upload resized image to cover folder        3.3 insert input into DB      3. else reload page with error      codepre  pI am now trying to implement the edit function using the same method, only the submit button now provides ID of the content as argument for the function. It is here where I get stuck. I cant figure out which additional conditions I should be adding and where I should put them. I need the function to work as followsp  pwhen codemethodcode is codenewcode and image is selected run the full step code1code amp code2codep  pwhen codemethodcode is codenewcode and image wasnt provided run the step code1code and code2code where code2code gives error and runs code3codep  pwhen codemethodcode is codeXcode and image is provided run the full step code1code amp code2code but instead of insert do update on content id codeXcodep  pwhen codemethodcode is codeXcode and image is not provided ignore the image upload amp manipulation and update all the field except imagep  pI hope this makes sense for you. I am not asking for the actual PHP code, all I would like to know is what should I be checking for and where. I just dont want to use the upload code three times when it always does the same, etc. Thank you for reading and in advance for your replies. I will continue working on this myself and will update the question if Ill figure it out. p

Its an upright shooting game supposed to be designed with various weapons and enemies.p  pThis rainbow gradient I have uses an array of eight different Color objects. For every frame passed through, I change the ycoordinate for both Point2D.Float objects required for the gradient paint as desired. In order for the animation to work, I have to actually instantiate another object of LinearGradientPaint again, with some of the previous properties from the previous object, and have it be referenced by the variable background of type Paint.p  pProblem is, LinearGradientPaint does not have a method to where you can do a translate on the two end points, and the get methods do not return the actual object that LinearGradientPaint object contains. what I mean is, the get methods return a new object of Point2D with the same values as those part of the LinearGradientPaint object.p  pFor every frame passed, I have to change not only the ycoordinate property of the shape thats associated with the gradient, but also set the locations of the two Point2D objects that are needed to instantiate LinearGradientPaint once again.p  pI would love to reexplain this much simpler, because I can have trouble with some knowledge of English, even though this is my primary language. Please let me know if you need reexplanation.p

Negative 343 pIm trying to model the effect of different filter building blocks on a system which is a construct based on these filters. I would like the basic filters to be modular, i.e. they should be replaceable, without rewriting the construct which is based upon the basic filters.p  pFor example, I have a system of filters G0, G1, which is defined in terms of some basic filters called H0 and H1.p  pIm trying to do the followingp  precode    syms z     syms H0z H1z     G0zH0z4H0z2H0z     G1zH1z4H0z2H0z codepre  pThis declares the zdomain Id like to work in, and a construct of two filters G0,G1, based on the basic filters H0,H1.p  pNow, Im trying to evaluate the construct in terms of some basic filtersp  precode    H1z  1z1     H0z  10z1 codepre  pWhat I would like to get at this point is an expanded polynomial of z. E.g. for the declarations above, Id like to see that G0z1, and that G1z1z4.p  pIve tried stuff like subsG0z, formulaG0z, formulasubssubsG0z, but I keep getting result in terms of H0 and H1.p  pAny advice Many thanks in advance.p  pEdit  some clarificationsp  ul liIn reality, I have 1020 transfer functions like G0 and G1, so Im trying to avoid redeclaring all of them every time I change the basic blocks H0 and H1. The basic blocks H0 and H1 would actually be of a much higher degree than they are in the example here.li liG0 and G1 will not change after being declared, only H0 and H1 will.li licodeH0z2code means using z2 as an argument for codeH0zcode. So wherever z appears in the declaration of H0, z2 should be plugged inli liThe desired output is a function in terms of z, not H0 and H1.li liA workable hack is having an mFile containing the declarations of the construct G0 and G1 in this example, which is run every time H0 and H1 are redefined. I was wondering if theres a more elegant way of doing it, along the lines of the nonworking code shown above.li ul

Its methods look like thisp  precode extends Employee getFirst void setFirst extends Employee codepre  pThis makes it impossible to call the codesetFirstcode method. The codecompilercode only knows that it needs some codesubtypecode of codeEmployeescode, but it doesnt know which type. It refuses to codepass any specific typecode  after all codecodemight not match it.p  pQuestion I do not understand why it refuses to pass any specific type. so what does this method accept code extends Employeecode  means include Employee and any subtype of Employee. so passing an Employee should be legal correctp  pFrom the bookp  precodepairlt super Managergt has methods void setFirst super Manager  super Manager getFirst codepre  pThe compiler doesnt know the exact type of the codesetFirstcode method and therefore cant call it with an object of type codeEmployee or Objectcode, but only with codeManagercode or a codesubtypecode such as codeexecutivecode.p  pQuestion So here I say the method can accept any Manager objects or that extends Manager object similar to subytpe bound above.

So that, I added new shipping method namely strongflat rate per productstrong, by using a new module. p  pBased on this module, a text box is added to all the products in admin to specify the special shipping price. If I filled this field with some value, It considers it as a special shipping price.

Negative 343 pI know global variables arent encouraged in Ruby but this is what I have been asked to do so youll just have to go with me on this.

This is so when I add an additional Sinatra method to the end of the file, the buffer is displayed in a browser i.e localhost4567.p  pSo effectively, with the Sinatra gem called, running the codespec.rbcode from a command window should result in the messages being displayed in the Web server in addition to the command window.

My thinking is I need to add a line to each activity concatenating the output of each to the global variable buffer but how do I do this Obviously following that, I need to write a Sinatra method that displays the contents of the global variable in the web browser. p  pHope that makes sense.p  pI have two files, spec.rb and gen.rb.

Negative 343 pI am using ASIO to readwrite to a device through a serial port. When I start my program, I first need to ensure that the device is properly configured. This is done by a series of writes in an codeinitializedevicecode function. The device sends back some data which is of no interest after these calls.p  pWhen codeinitializedevicecode is done, I call my codestartreceivecode function which in turns calls an codeasioasyncreaduntilcode, and my handler again calls codestartreceivecodep  pThe problem, however, is that the irrelevant data that was sent to me during codeinitializedevicecode is received by my handler, even though this was data that was received before my first read. This was unexpected for me.p  pI am thus wondering if theres a correct way to flush the internal buffer that the asioserialport uses after codeinitializedevicecode is completed I really aint interested in any data that was received before I explicitly start reading the port.p

This object has one attribute a letter, indicating  the letter that must be printed on the user terminal.  class SharedLock      private char letter      public SharedLockchar letter              this.letter  letter                    Every thread which is owner of the shared locks         monitor call this method to retrieve the letter          that must be printed according to the alphabetic order.          public synchronized char getLetter              return this.letter                    Every thread which is the owner of the shared locks          monitor and besides has just printed its letter, before          releasing the ownership of the shared locks monitor,         calls this method in order to set the next          letter according to the alphabetic order to          be printed by the next owner of the shared          locks monitor          public synchronized void setLetterchar letter              this.letter  letter          As said earlier each thread has a letter attribute. So if I create 4 threads, there will be one thread  for each letter, one which prints only A, another  which prints only B, and so on.  Besides each threads constructor takes as second  parameter the shared lock object described above.  If the letter attribute of a thread which is the owner  of the shared locks monitor, is the same as  the shared locks letter attribute, then the thread can print its letter because it respects the alphabetic order otherwise it has to wait.  class LetterPrinter implements Runnable      private char letter     private SharedLock lock      public LetterPrinterchar letter, SharedLock lock              this.letter  letter         this.lock  lock           public void run              whiletrue                       Here the current thread tries to become the owner of              the shared locks monitor             synchronizedthis.lock                                                   Test whether the letter attribute of this                      thread must be printed. This will happen                     only if the letter of the shared lock and                     the threads letter attribute are the same.                                  whilethis.lock.getLetter  this.letter                                      try                                               The letters are different so in order to respect                           the alphabetic order this thread has to wait                         this.lock.wait                                          catchInterruptedException e                                              e.printStackTrace                                                                  printing the letter             System.out.formats sn,                  Thread.currentThread.getName, this.letter               preparing for the next letter print according to the               alphabetic order             switch this.letter                              case A this.lock.setLetterB break                 case B this.lock.setLetterC break                 case C this.lock.setLetterD break                 case D this.lock.setLetterA break                            And finally releasing the ownership of               the shared locks monitor             synchronizedthis.lock                              this.lock.notifyAll                              public class MyTestClass      public static void mainString[] args                creating the shared lock object which is initialized          by the letter A.

Yet if you look at the run method above you will see that at the end the notify call has also been placed in a synchronized block.p  pJust to see what happens, I eliminated the synchronized block and I just wrote the notify alone for releasing the ownership of the locks monitor and I got p  precodeException in thread Thread0 java.lang.IllegalMonitorStateException         at java.lang.Object.notifyAllNative Method         at LetterPrinter.runMyTestClass.java105         at java.lang.Thread.runThread.java745 codepre  pAccording to the documentation of a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase8docsapijavalangIllegalMonitorStateException.html relnofollowIllegalMonitorStateExceptionap  blockquote   ppublic class IllegalMonitorStateException extends RuntimeExceptionp      pThrown to indicate that a thread has attempted to wait on an  objects   monitor or to notify other threads waiting on an objects  monitor   without owning the specified monitor.p blockquote  pWhich is exactly my question. Why p  pwhy notify call, when the ownership of the shared lock is being released by the current owner, must also be placed within a synchronized blockp  pAccording to the documentation of a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase8docsapijavalangObject.htmlnotify relnofollownotifya and a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase8docsapijavalangObject.htmlnotifyAll relnofollownotifyAllap  blockquote   pA thread becomes the owner of the objects monitor in one of three   waysp      ul   liBy executing a synchronized instance method of that object.li   listrongBy executing the body of a synchronized statement that synchronizes on the object.strongli   liFor objects of type Class, by executing a synchronized static method of that class.li   ul      pOnly one thread at a time can own an objects monitor.p blockquote  pAnd the second one that is, a synchronized statement on the lock is what I do. Therefore every thread which is not the good one according to the alphabetic order waits. So when the notify on the lock is executed, this can be run only by a thread which is the owner of its monitor and no other thread can try to run this as all others are waiting.p  pSo I dont understand why putting the notify call at the end of the run method outside a synchronized block, raises the a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase8docsapijavalangIllegalMonitorStateException.html relnofollowIllegalMonitorStateExceptiona exceptionp  pIm rather beginner in concurrency. Clearly it seems that there is something about the execution of the statements and the OS scheduler which I misunderstand.p  pCould someone kindly make some clarificationp

Then we add a mRV, and now we have c55 and c57   I am fine with the fact that Backbone deleted the 26, because it reinstantiated a 55 version of it.  However, when we tried to manipulate 55, it came up with an undefined error. We traced this back to being an issue with a property of that specific mRV, and noticed that there were 3 Backbone Views in the application [26, 55, 57] where there should have been two [55, 57].   So how would I set it up properly to delete BOTH the Backbone View and the DOM representation given the three situations add, delete, changeallp  pFor referencep  pIn measureView.js  p  precoderender function      var compiledTemplate  .template MeasureTemplate, measureTemplateParameters         If we are adding a rep, clear the current reps, then add the template      whilethis.newMeasureRepViews.length gt0          var deleting  this.newMeasureRepViews.pop         deleting.stopListening         delete deleting              Im assuming this isnt correct, and the DOM should be coupled to the View, so that when the View is deleted the DOM is as well.       Maybe we call this.destroy or this.remove here      this.el.html  clear the html       append the new completed compiled template      this.el.append compiledTemplate        ...    codepre  pTo recap, I am wonderingp  ol liCan the current code structure accomplish what Im trying to do with deletingaddingchanging viewsli liDo we use destroy or removeli ol

Negative 343 pSo I have been spending sometime with this linq and couldnt come up with an optimal solution. Considering the following linqp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comLbH0N.png altenter image description herep  pI want to be able to select the distinct entries based on the BaseItemID value, so for example whenever I have two Chicken entries, I want to select the second entry because it superseeds the first entry. Another way to phrase it is whenever an entry have a BaseItemID value, pick this entry and remove the base entry from the list, so the list would be returned with the Item 1003 removed. Yet another way to phrase the condition is to select only the items that doesnot have their ID value existing in any row in the BaseItemID field.p  pThe problem would have been easy if I can group by the name for example, and then pick the item with the emBaseItemID  null and Count  1em, but thats not the case and the Name field is not unique and i cant really depend on it for the grouping.p  pThanksp

Negative 343 pIm getting odd results with Embers test helpers codeandThencode and codeclickcode.  According to Embers a hrefhttpemberjs.comguidestestingtesthelpers relnofollowdocumentationap  blockquote   pthe codeandThencode helper will wait for all preceding asynchronous helpers   to complete prior to progressing forward.p blockquote  pHowever, Im finding this doesnt always seem to be the case.

I can only get the expected ABC order when I use only 1 of the two click helpers.

Negative 343 pIm looking into developing a solution that can interface with a variety of languages Python, C, C, LabVIEW, where I can send data to and from the solution. It interfaces with a FlexRIO system, where large amounts of data will be processed as quickly as possible with FPGAs. The solution itself may be written in C or LabVIEW my limits are the options I have software wise to interface with the FlexRIO drivers.p  pThis software will accept commands that will be predefined for example RESETALL, but the size of the data may be extremely large like an array of 10 million characters.p  pSo for example, I can write code in Python to send commands to this software and also get information back.p  pWhat are some options I have when it comes to how to send this data I was thinking TCPIP, but I dont know of the speed and memory limits I may have. Both softwares will be on the same computer as well.p

Negative 343 pThis is for a homework assignment, so explanations and not direct code are what I need.p  pWe recently started learned about copy constructorsassignment  operators and such. In the handout we got in class our professor showed us how if you want to deep copy pointers you have to dereference them and copy the values directly. p  pEg from handoutp  precodeclass IntCellFixed  public IntCellFixedint initialValue  0  storedValue  new intinitialValue   v This bit here v IntCellFixedconst IntCellFixed ampsource  storedValue  new int storedValue  source.storedValue   This bit here   ...  private int storedValue  codepre  pThis makes sense to me. You have a pointer, and you want to have the value it points to be equal to the value of the pointer youre copying from. So you do  to have it change the value at the address its pointing at, and not the address itself. That makes sense to me.p  pSo when we went to apply that in lab, I tried a similar thing, but with linked lists instead of just pointers to an integer. Even with the TAs help with the TA looking at and tweaking my code until it was the correct thing, it still did not work and just gave me a segfault. I did not have a chance to ask what exactly the code was supposed to be, and the solution hasnt been posted yet.p  pWere doing almost the same thing in our homework. Here is the structure of our node in a binary search treep  precodestruct Node      int data     int count     Node left     Node right  codepre  pIn my void BinarySearchTreeinsertNode node,Node parent, int value function, I have this bit of codep  precodeif node  NULL          node  new Node         nodegtdata  value         nodegtcount  1         nodegtleft  NULL         nodegtright  NULL  codepre  pWhen I try to do this, however, it gives me the error invalid type argument of unary  have int. When I take off the , it runs fine, but doesnt actually save the data for the node outside of the insert function. ie when trying to insert multiple values, it always starts with an empty tree, even after Ive supposedly inserted values already. p  pAs far as I understand it, I WOULD need to dereference the node because I dont want the address its pointing to to change, I want whats AT the address to change. p  pAm I just completely misunderstanding howwhen to dereference If I am, could somebody explain when I would need to, and why I wouldnt need to in this case Or, if its a syntax error, could somebody tell me what the syntax should be p

Im trying to make a GUI program that will display different food genres and then when the user presses the genre they want it will show a randomly generated restraunt of that genre. I am fairly new to programming and I am having a hard time figuing out how to make my buttons actually work. I have assigned the Restraunts objects each a value. Mexican will be values 1 and 2. Italian will be values 3 and 4.

Negative 343 pI am trying to write a jekyll plugin that will take a normal markdown file and provide some extra functionality on top of it. In particular, I need to do some not actually fancy things with tables. I know you can write straight HTML into a markdown file, but there is a requirement that the content folks dont want to  cant edit HTML.p  pAs an extra wrench in the works, the mobile layout has a UX requirement that I essentially have to render the table as a group of divs as opposed to a table.p  pMy initial thought was to pass the page.content variable to a ruby function extending LiquidTag. From there I was planning on parsing the markdown file and either 1. If normal nontable markdown, use as normal 2. If table markdown, look for custom identifier in markdown, do what needs to be done e.g. add class, etcp  pIf I do something like thisp  precodedef rendercontext     content  LiquidTemplate.parsemarkup.render context end codepre  pIt renders the context as a normal markdown file. However, I want to break up the context variable and work with the pieces before rendering. Ive tried a few different approaches that Ive gotten from the jekyll docs and Stack Overflow and gotten nowhere.p  pDoes anyone have any experience with this I am heading down the right path For what its worth, RubyJekyllLiquid is fairly new to me, so if you think I may have missed something fairly basic and obvious then please let me know.p

Negative 343 pWe are currently working on a project to benchmark a program on different architectures. Most of the codebase is identical and an early version runs on all architectures. We discovered some architecturespecific optimizations and branched off one version in a named branch. However, this happened too late.p  pThe commit tree looks like thisp  precode  A      B     C D         M    H         P codepre  pAt commit B, the thenanonymous branches diverged and were merged in commit M. We noticed that optimizations good for one architecture are detrimental for the second one and decided to keep the architecturespecific changes in a name branch with current head P.  D introduced some bugs which break unit tests, this was discovered after merging in M. To continue locally I reverted most of the changes in H and Commits B and H are almost identical. I am currently at head H and noticed that the changes introduced by B are already optimized for the architecture Im not working on.p  pI would now like to continue with the code from commit A, but make it as easy as possible to transplant further algorithmic changes to P.

Negative 343 pIm writing some ReactFlux code and using Jest to test it. So far its been great, except my test are already taking a long time to complete.p  pThe culprit seems to be resetting the mocks in between each test.p  pMy general set up will look something like thisp  precodejest.dontMockreact jest.dontMock..Widget.jsx  describeWidget, function    var React, TestUtils, Widget, WidgetStore    beforeEachfunction      React  requirereactaddons     TestUtils  React.addons.TestUtils     WidgetStore  require..WidgetStore     Widget  require..Widget       itshould fetch initial state from the store, function      WidgetStore.getDoobles.mockReturnValueOnce      var widget  TestUtils.renderIntoDocutment       ltWidget gt           expectWidgetStore.getDoobles.mock.calls.length.toBe1       itshould refresh its data when clicked, function      WidgetStore.getDoobles.mockReturnValueOnce      var widget  TestUtils.renderIntoDocutment       ltWidget gt           WidgetStore.getDoobles.mockReturnValueOncefoo bar              TestUtils.Simulate.clickwidget      expectWidgetStore.getDoobles.mock.calls.length.toBe2     codepre  pIn my example if I dont reload the store in between the two tests I will get the wrong result for the number of calls to codegetDooblescode, which makes sense since it would be the same object.p  pBut reloading the mock takes a bit of time and if I do lots of tests then they end up being slow.p  pI would love to just clone the object or call a reset function. There is a reset function for an individual function codemockClearcode but there doesnt seem to be a global reset for the whole object. And I cant clone the object because the clone isnt the same object as the one that my React component is accessing, so none of the calls will get registered.p  pWhich brings up the other issue. It seems I need to reload everything in the dependency chain. If I were to just rerequire codeWidgetStorecode then the object I have access to doesnt seem to be the same object that codeWidgetcode has access to.p  pIf I just reload codeWidgetStorecode and codeWidgetcode then I will often get errors which seem to be caused by a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions27153166typeerrorwhenusingreactcannotreadpropertyfirstchildofundefinedhaving two copies of React loadeda. So I end up having to reload React each time as well.p  pSo is there a better way of doing thisp

These are situations that do not need a session, and my Beans are codeRequestScopedcode. As an example, the pages codelogin.xhtmlcode, coderegister.xhtmlcode and codepasswordRecovery.xhtmlcode.p  pIn these cases, it is very strange display an error to the user saying that your session has expired. So if you open the login page and stand still for a while, when he inform your data and click Login, it would be forwarded to an error page. I would just ignore it and let transparent to the user. p  pSo, my solution so far is create a codeExceptionHandlercode to ignore these exceptionsp  precodeOverride public void handle throws FacesException      for IteratorltExceptionQueuedEventgt i  getUnhandledExceptionQueuedEvents.iterator i.hasNext          ExceptionQueuedEvent event  i.next         ExceptionQueuedEventContext context  ExceptionQueuedEventContext event.getSource         Throwable t  context.getException          just remove the exception from queue         if t instanceof ViewExpiredException              i.remove                   getWrapped.handle  codepre  pThen, I created a filter to check whether the user is logged in, if not then redirected to login page emThis filter applies only pages that require authenticationemp  precodeOverride public void doFilterServletRequest req, ServletResponse res, FilterChain chain         throws IOException, ServletException      HttpServletRequest request  HttpServletRequest req     HttpServletResponse response  HttpServletResponse res      if loginManagedBean.isLogged          String pathLogin  request.getContextPath    LOGINVIEW         if isAJAXRequestrequest              response.setContentTypetextxml             response.getWriter                     .appendltxml version1.0 encodingUTF8gt                     .printfltpartialresponsegtltredirect urlsgtltredirectgtltpartialresponsegt, pathLogin             return                   pathLogin  source  request.getServletPath          response.sendRedirectpathLogin         return           chain.doFilterrequest, response  codepre  pSo when the session expires, does not affect the user experience in the login and registration pages.

Negative 343 pI have an input file saved in a specified folder and used a stream reader to read the content one line at a time. So my program reads the first line and adds the content in the textbox.

Negative 343 pI am trying to use grsync A GUI for rsync for Windows to run backups. In the directory that I am backing up there are many larger files that are updated periodically. I would like to be able to sync just the changes to those files and not the entire file each backup. I was under the impression that rsync is a blocklevel file copier and would only copy the bytes that had changed between each sync. Perhaps this is not the case, or I have misunderstood what blocklevel file coping isp  pTo test this I used grsync to synchronize a 5GB zip file between two directories. Then I added a very small text file to the zip file and ran grsync again. However it proceeded to copy over the entire zip file again. Is there a utility that would only copy over the changes to this zip file and not the entire file again Or is there a command within grsync that could be used to this effect p

The problem is how to call P1 properly using the cython callback with inner C multithread.p  pI am now well aware of the GIL in Python, and the withnogil from Cython a hrefhttpdocs.cython.orgsrcuserguideexternalCcode.htmlacquiringandreleasingthegil relnofollowhttpdocs.cython.orgsrcuserguideexternalCcode.htmlacquiringandreleasingthegilap  pAnd also from the API a hrefhttpsdocs.python.org2capiinit.htmlnonpythoncreatedthreads relnofollowhttpsdocs.python.org2capiinit.htmlnonpythoncreatedthreadsap  pThe post I read here are only onesided communication PythonCython or CythonPython or the issue of multithreading in C calling Cython omited.p  pTherefore, how to handle that case p  pSince Cython is used, the API for C is discarded. The most probable solution is related to the with gilnogil option in Cython.p  pMy idea is that nogil should be put on C0 since the code goes into C library, and with gil on C1.p  precodeC0... nogil C1... with gil codepre  pBack in the diagramp  precode                                                      Python        P0                    P1    P1                                                                                                                                                                   v    v                    Cython        gtC0 nogil        C1    C1 with gil                                                                                                                                                    v              C                  gtF0...                 gt...                                   v                                                              codepre  pHowever, my experience is that one of the P1 function never returns to the Cython properly and the code remains stuck waiting indefinitely for P1 to return.p  pWhat would be the right answer or the explanation to the code being stuck when returning from P1 p  pstrongADD1strong The code is a test example working perfectly with one thread or with OpenMP set to one thread. Also the multithread test is working when not using PythonCython interface, purely a CC example. Hence the problem related to the GIL or related to threading in PythonCython.p

Negative 343 pIm currently designing a database for a fairly large meteor app, and were debating whether Meteor will perform better using more subscriptions, to collections of tiny documents, or fewer subscriptions to collections of larger documents.  p  pSome of these documents could in end become quite large, such as listings of user favourites or preferences, that would only be viewable to the individual user in a particular view.p  pIn terms of numbers were talking about 10 subscriptions, at least four of which would not be consistently subscribed too, returning only a single larger document in particular views.  p  pVersus 4 subscriptions to collections of possibly quite large documents, I realize that those individual view would probably render faster having the data already on the client.p  pAny insights or empirical data would be incredibly helpful.p  pThanks.p

Negative 343 pI have position, time, lat, long, velocity and elevation data for a train. My problem is that i want to remove the data points where the train has stopped, this would include the deceleration and acceleration measurements. The idea is to compare a number of trains travelling the same path under optimum conditions, ie not stopping. The measurements show the trains stopping at different times and locations. I currently check if the previous location is the same and then check if the speed is less than 50 of the previous 3 values. The problem is if more than the previous 3 values are o or less than 50 of the previous kept speed, then i dont remove all the required data, such as the train accelerating back up to speed, such as U60 below.p  pHere is the the eqn is U60p  precodeIFP60P59,removed,IFS60lt0.5S59,removed,IFU59removed,IFS60lt0.5S58,removed,IFS60lt0.5S57,removed,P60,P60 codepre  pThe only way i can think of to catch this is to have multiple nested conditions upto 20 to catch all the points. This may not be enough for some trains.p  pIs there a way to remove the deceleration and acceleration points this may be 2 or 3 points without having to have 20 nested conditionsp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.commwIeH.png altenter image description herep

Negative 343 pIve entered a project that used the architecture where all the utility classes were stored in the same project as the plugin. Thats fine as long as theres only a few plugins with different utilities.p  pI noticed, however, that as the number of plugins has grown, many of the individual utility classes overlap. So, Id like to pull out all the utilities into a single, separate project. My fear is that its going to be too complicated to maintain once Im leaving the customer as theyre not technically keen.p  pThe best solution Ive got this far is a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.combcrmarchive20101109howtoreferenceassembliesfromplugins.aspx relnofollowfollowing this bloga facilitating ILMerge. However, I wonder if theres a simpler way. The optimal approach would be if I can make the CRM see the utility DLL just by uploading it. Can I somehow register a nonplugin, nonexecutable DLL that the plugins can refer top

Negative 343 pI have two tables in my database called blogarticles and blogcomments. I have added a comment system to my blog following a tutorial that uses Javascript and Ajax to load the comments into the page. The issue is with tying the comments to the individual blog posts. The comments that load into the page are not related to the blog post and are visible to all other posts.p  pLooking into the blogcomments table after creating a comment the cmtarticleid field shows 0. I assume it should be reading or referencing the articleid number in the blogarticles table. p  pThanks in advance.p  pDatabase Tables Sqlp  precode CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS blogcomments  commentid int11 NOT NULL AUTOINCREMENT, name varchar100 NOT NULL, emailid varchar100 NOT NULL, comment text NOT NULL, time varchar100 NOT NULL, cmtarticleid int11 NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY commentid, KEY cmtarticleid cmtarticleid  ENGINEInnoDB  DEFAULT CHARSETlatin1 AUTOINCREMENT0   CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS blogarticles  articleid int11 NOT NULL AUTOINCREMENT, title varchar100 NOT NULL, articlebody text NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY articleid  ENGINEInnoDB  DEFAULT CHARSETlatin1 AUTOINCREMENT0  codepre  pController blog.php p  precodefunction displaycomments       data[query]  thisgtmdlblogcommentsgtgetarticle     data[comments]  thisgtmdlblogcommentsgtgetcomments     thisgtloadgtviewblogsinglepost, data  function insertcomments      insertinfo  thisgtmdlblogcommentsgtinsertcommentsarticle     data[comments]thisgtmdlblogcommentsgtgetlatestcomment     data[comments]  thisgtmdlblogcommentsgtgetcomments     echo thisgtloadgtviewblogcommentdisplay, data  function displaycomments      data[comments]  thisgtmdlblogcommentsgtgetcomments     echo thisgtloadgtviewblogcommentdisplay, data  codepre  pModel mdlblogcomments.phpp  precode insert comments function insertcommentsarticle      thisgtloadgthelperdate     name  thisgtinputgtpostname     email  thisgtinputgtpostemail     articleid  thisgtinputgtpostarticleid     comment  thisgtinputgtpostcomment     datestring  Ymd  hi a     time  time     date  mdatedatestring, time     insertcomment  thisgtdbgtinsertblogcomments, array                name gt name,                 emailid gt email,                 comment gt comment,                 time gt date,                 cmtarticleid gt articleid                return insertcomment   retrive comments function getcomments      articleid  thisgtinputgtpostarticleid     thisgtdbgtselect     thisgtdbgtfromblogcomments     thisgtdbgtwherecmtarticleid, articleid     return thisgtdbgtget  function getlatestcomment      articleid  thisgtinputgtpostarticleid     thisgtdbgtselect     thisgtdbgtfromblogcomments     thisgtdbgtwherecmtarticleid, articleid     thisgtdbgtorderbycommentid, DESC     thisgtdbgtlimit1     return thisgtdbgtget  codepre  pView singlepost.php p  precode ltformgt     lt html comment form gt  ltform classformhorizontal methodpost idformgt   ltdiv classformgroupgt     ltlabel forname classcolsm2 controllabelgtNameltlabelgt     ltdiv classcolsm10gt          ltinput typetext classformcontrol idname namename  placeholderFirst amp Last Name valuegt     ltdivgt ltdivgt ltdiv classformgroupgt     ltlabel foremail classcolsm2 controllabelgtEmailltlabelgt     ltdiv classcolsm10gt         ltinput typeemail classformcontrol idemail nameemail placeholderexampledomain.com valuegt     ltdivgt ltdivgt ltdiv classformgroupgt     ltlabel formessage classcolsm2 controllabelgtCommentltlabelgt     ltdiv classcolsm10gt         lttextarea classformcontrol rows4 idcomment  namecommentgt lttextareagt     ltdivgt ltdivgt  ltdiv classformgroupgt     ltdiv classcolsm10 colsmoffset2gt         ltinput idsubmit namesubmit typesubmit valueSubmit Comment classbtn btninverse btnlggt     ltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pp  precodeltscriptgt    document.readyfunction        var articleid  article.val       .postltphp echo baseurlgtblogdisplaycomments,                     articleidarticleid        ,             functiondata                      displaycomment.htmldata          function  submit.clickfunction       var name  name.val     var email  email.val     var comment  comment.val     var articleid  article.val  var dataString namenameampemailemailampcommentcomment   amparticleidarticleid ifname  email  comment   alertPlease Give Valid Details    else   displaycomment.fadeIn100.htmlltimg srcltphp echo    baseurlgtuploadsajaxloader.gif gtLoading Comment... .ajax     type POST,     url ltphp echo baseurlgtbloginsertcomments,     data dataString,     cache false,  success functiondata  displaycomment.htmldata displaycomment.fadeInslow   return false     ltscriptgt codepre
Negative 343 pI am trying to make a form fade away from the taskbar if the user is not currently hovering over the form with the mouse. The form contains hyperlinks. On the adverse, i want the form to reset to its original position if the mouse comes back to the form.

If i enter the form, both events fire.

In order to do that I need data structure with fast access to elements based on playerss level and also this data structure is an interchanging one cause I need to update elements as a game start or finish, I have an idea of using an inverted index for that because you have a dictionary with keys of levels and also a linked list of players for special level, as soon as someone come I can get his level and look for other guys in the inverted index by O1 but the problem is when there is no one same as him in a key and now I should go to others keys but which one   Actually it will be a little bit dirty and I guess there could be better way since there is so many online games with same strategy p  pExcuse me if it is a little long but I have to make it clear  p  pthank you in advance . p

I am trying to write a python wrapper code for the C class through a hrefhttpcython.org relnofollowCythona that can access codexcode. How can I do thisp  pBest thing would be to be able to access the variable without copying a lot of data, as codexcode might be large.

Negative 343 pHaving to sink in my teeth into Java Executor Service I noticed that it falls flat for some of my requirementsp  ol liI need to implement a small reactive system. So a Task can result in a new Task.li liThe tasks schedule dynamically either as a reaction of an event waiting for a token pool for instance or by time.li liIf a task dies I need to react accordingly so a task may be composed by different event methods or at least provide a listener service like the Google guava libli ol  pI do not like the idea to implement it myself. But it is a event listener collection waiting for events to happen and immediately schedule tasks for this. Scheduling a job for a certain point in time is just also generating a timer event that is triggered by a waiting queue waiting for the nearest timer event to happen notify the framework and done.p  pSo is there something around that provides this or a default way to use a Java Executor for thisp

Negative 343 pThe Google App Engine doc states that As a convenience, you can decorate the request handler with ndb.toplevel.p  pCan ndb.toplevel be used with python methods that are not request handlersp  pI have a python method mymethod that calls ndb.putmultiasync, and mymethod gets called in unit tests.  I would like a call to mymethod to complete the putmultiasync before proceeding.

Negative 343 pSo I have been having this problem for a while now, i need to join two tables, but I dont have a unique identifier so i have to use ID and date ranges instead. And if 2 date ranges overlap, i need to join first value. AND I need to be an outer join. The code i have right now is theoretically correct, but it doesnt fit the situation I cant make this join an outer join, because I get an error this way. p  pThe logic is following Employee can be an Expatriate. If he is an expatriate, I need to show all columns. BUT the tricky part  if during the assignment between effectivestartdate and effectiveenddate he was in 2 different countries, I need to show information about the last trip only. The last part about only joining on MAXvalidto needs to be adjusted  so this way, there is a unique combination of assignmentid, effetivestartdate, effectiveend date so this table joins to other tables correctly. p  pI know this can be fixed with a single join, I just cant figure out how I can probably do it without using any nested subqueries. p  pPlease, provide me with ORACLE syntax, yes I know some say its outdated, but this piece of code absolutely needs to be in syntax its written in now  its much more easy for me to understand.p  precodewith assignments assignmentid, personid, effectivestartdate, effectiveenddate as     select 456, 123, date 20150101, date 20150315 from dual union all      select 456, 123, date 20150316, date 47121231 from dual union all       select  975, 123, date 20150316, date 47121231 from dual union all   select  674, 145, date 20150316, date 47121231 from dual  ,   expatriates personid, homecountry, hostcountry, datefrom, dateto, validfrom, validto as     select 123, TEST2, TEST2,    date 20150101, date 20150315, date 20150101, date   20150315 from dual union all    select 123, TEST1, TEST1,    date 20150416, date 20160615, date 20150416, date   20160615 from dual union all    select 123, TEST,  TEST,   date 20150316, date 20160415, date 20150316, date 20150415 from dual    select  a.assignmentid, a.personid,  a.effectivestartdate,  a.effectiveenddate, subq.homecountry,  subq.hostcountry,  subq.datefrom,  subq.dateto from assignments a, expatriates subq  where  a.personidsubq.personid and subq.validfrom lt a.effectiveenddate and subq.validto gt a.effectivestartdate and subq.datefrom      select      maxdatefrom    from expatriates sq2      where        sq2.personid  a.personid and        sq2.validfrom lt a.effectiveenddate and        sq2.validto gt a.effectivestartdate   codepre
