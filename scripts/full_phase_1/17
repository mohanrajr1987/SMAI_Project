Positive 17 pI have a project A that I am using for two purposes one as a library, and as a Eclipse plugin project that gives more support for the library.  I have other projects e.g. project B which want to use the library and so add project A to its build path through EclipseConfigure Build Path.  Ive done this many times before I added the plugin nature to project A.  It worked as expected.p  pBut now, If I run classes in project B as Java Application or JUnit Test, they hang as soon as they attempt to put up a window JFrame or JDialog.  Its deep in native code.  The debugger saysp  precodeCGLGraphicsConfig.getCGLConfigInfoint, int, int line not available [native method]    codepre  pThis happens even if the code in the class doesnt use anything in project A. Project B has some main classes that need project A and others which dont.  If I remove project A from project Bs build path, then the classes that still compile can run fine, put up JDialogs, JFrames.p  pThis is on MacOSX Yosemite running Java 7 or Java 8.  It was happening with Juno, and I upgraded to Kepler and then to Luna, with no success.  Still everything hangs.p  pI think that there must be something about a plugin project that puts something dangerous on the build path.  I tried putting project A at the very bottom below the JRE put it still causes this behavior.p  pIm guessing that I could work around the problem by separating the project A into two parts, but thats annoying.p

Positive 17 pThe requirement is that, I need to write an ArrayList of integers. I need threadsafe access of the different integers write, read, increase, decrease, and also need to allow maximum concurrency.p  pThe operation with each integer is also special, like this  Mostly frequent operation is to read  Secondly frequent operation is to decrease by one only if the value is greater than zero. Or, to increase by one unconditionally  Addingremoving elements is rare, but still needed.p  pI thought about AtomicInteger. However this becomes unavailable, because the atomic operation I want is to compare if not zero, then decrease. However the atomic operation provided by AtomicInteger, is compare if equal, and set. If you know how to apply AtomicInteger in this case, please raise it here.p  pWhat I am thinking is to synchronized the access to each integer like this p  precodeArrayList ltIntegergt list  ... ...  Compare if greater than zero, and decrease Integer n  list.getindex boolean success  false synchronized n      if ngt0  n successtrue     To add one Integer n  list.getindex synchronized n      n    To just read, I am thinking no need synchronization at all. int n  list.getindex.intValue codepre  pWith my solution, is there any sideeffect Is it efficient to maintain hundreds or even thousands of synchronized integersp  pThen another thing is to implement the operation of adddelete, that it is threadsafe, but do not impact much of the concurrency of the other operations. I am thinking ReadWriteLock, for adddelete, need to acquire the write lock, for other operations change the value of one integer, acquire the read lock.  Is this a right approachp

Negative 17 pI have a question regarding the MVVM design for CWPF. Ive had a look at several demo applications, but they didnt really handle my problem.

Negative 17 pI wrote a program to click on an application automatically at scheduled time using Win32, using codeMOUSEDOWNcode and codeMOUSEUPcode.

But I noticed that sometimes, the click is too long.  The click is actually on a Flash apps Right Arrow.  This right arrow will go to the next item on a list.  So if you codeMOUSEDOWNcode for a little longer, it actually will shift 2 or 3 items instead of just 1 item.p  pSo I wonder, is there a way to accurately simulate 1 click in this case.  Probably there is no codeMOUSECLICKcode event  It has to be simulated using codeMOUSEDOWNcode and codeMOUSEUPcodep  pit is actually called codeMOUSEEVENTFLEFTDOWNcode and codeMOUSEEVENTFLEFTUPcode on Win32, just for simplicity it is stated as codeMOUSEDOWNcode instead.p

Negative 17 pWe have written an application that manages OpenVPN from the tray as an addon for a bigger software package.p  pOpenVPN includes a file called tapinstall.exe that installs the OpenVPN adapter or any driver for that matter.  Doing some research, this file is the exact same as a commandline tool called devcon that Microsoft includes in the Windows DDK.  The OpenVPN guys just renamed it for their use.p  pSo we use it during our setup msi installer in a custom action to install the driver, which for the most part, works just fine.p  pEvery now and again, devcon fails and hangsnever exiting.  After that point, you can rerun devcon and it will install the driver twice... which basically breaks OpenVPN.p  pHas anyone seen this issue with devcon, know what its doing, or know a way to fix itp  pAs an alternate solution, does anyone know how to install a driver from C  we have a .inf and a .sys filep  pUPDATE  Weve found this issues to be pretty rare.  It occurs most often when weve applied an update where we uninstall the V8 version of the OpenVPN adapter and then install the new version V9 of the OpenVPN adapter.  It also seems to not happen if you restart your PC in between installs, so we might be better off forcing a PC restart on uninstall....p  pSIDE NOTE Ive heard of people using WiX and the DifxAPI I think that is what its called to install drivers from an MSI installer.  Any ideas if this can be done from plain C in a custom action  We dont really want to start over with our setup project using WiX it could be time consuming.p

Negative 17 pReading through the existing unit testing related threads here on Stack Overflow, I couldnt find one with a clear answer about how to unit test file IO operations. I have only recently started looking into unit testing, having been previously aware of the advantages but having difficulty getting used to writing tests first. I have set up my project to use NUnit and Rhino Mocks and although I understand the concept behind them, Im having a little trouble understanding how to use Mock Objects.p  pSpecifically I have two questions that I would like answered. First, what is the proper way to unit test file IO operations Second, in my attempts to learn about unit testing, I have come across dependency injection.

Negative 17 pIm dynamically binding tables and sub tables using nested listviews. On the client side I have a piece of jQuery that is toggling the visiblity of TRs witin the tables in order to provide a group expand  contract view option.p  pOn postback Im obviously loosing my class changes that I have applied via jQuery. Im wondering what the best approach to maintaining these client side class changes is Ive considered creating a hidden input control per table to store the indexes of the visible TRs at the time of expanding them. The intention being to then look for the indexes during postback  rebinding and add the visible classes to each corresponding element.p  pIs there a better approach or some native method of passing back the client side style  class change to the server during postbacks p

Negative 17 pIm working with the following scenario I have an image map with hotspots. When you mouse over an codeltareagtcode on the image map, shows a codeltdiv classinfopanelgtcode.  This div overlaps the codeltareagtcode, so the div is hidden on mouseleave of codeltdiv classinfopanelgtcode. p  pThis mostly works, but on the odd occasion, for example if you go ballistic and move the mouse around too fast, the div stays up. I think it may be in the small instances where the codeltareagtcode and the codeltdivgtcode intersect. I wouldnt worry about it, only the client has pointed it out as a bug.p  pThe only foolproof way I can think to fix this is to check on mouse move if an infowindow is visible. If one is, then check whether the mouse is currently over it  if its not, then hide it.  This will ensure that an info window is never visible if a mouse is not over it.p  pMy question is how do I check whether the current mouse position is over an info window Bearing in mind that this is for the exception rather than the rule, and I dont know strongfor surestrong whether an info window is visible or notp

Negative 17 pI need to create a pogo stick that jumps across the screen in arcs. I was thinking the best way to do this would be to move it on a sin wave. If the top of the wave is 1, the ground is 0 and the bottom of the wave is 1, then every time it hits 0 I would reset the values to start the sin wave again. So instead of following the typical sin wave 0, 1, 0, 1, 0 etc it would go 0, 1, 0, 1, 0 etc. p  pUnfortunately my math is pretty terrible and Ive been trying for hours to develop a formula.

Negative 17 pIm developing a tournament version of a game where I expect 1000 simultaneous players. When the tournament begins, players will be eliminated quite fast possibly more than 5 per second, but the process will slow down as the tournament progresses. Depending when a player is eliminated from the tournament a certain amount of points is awarded. For example a player who drops first, gets nothing, while player who is 500th, receives 1 point and the first place winner receives say 200 points. Now Id like to award and display the amount of points right away after a player has been eliminated.p  pThe problem is that when I push a new row into a datastore after a player has been eliminated, the row entity has to be in a separate entity group so I would not hit the gae datastore limit of 15 writes per second for 1 entity group. Also I need to be able to read and write a count of rows consistently so I can determine the prize correctly for all the players that get eliminated.p  pWhat would be the best way to implement the datamodel to support thisp

Negative 17 pIm investigating solutions of storing and querying a historical record of event occurrences for a large number of items.p  pThis is the simplified scenario Im getting a daily log of 200 000 streetlamps labeled sl1 to sl200000 which shows if the lamp was operational on the day or not.

Negative 17 pHere is my entire application. Pretty easy stuff. p  pI have two panels that have a codeclickcode event on them. However, both call the same function for some reason.

My function is looking for only the current target but apparently I must not be doing that correctly because its animating both panels and not just the panel the I clicked.

Negative 17 pA couple of days ago I asked myself which datastructure I should in a function in strongCstrong. I usually write in strongCstrong and the choice would have fallen to stdvector.p  pThere a some possible choicesp  ul lia static big enough arrayli lia dynamic array which grows when needede.g. doubling its size   li lian own list implementation as struct with a pointer emnextem li ul  pThe last option seems to be unusual. Are there any bigger project where someone uses own structures like lists Is there a general rule for the decision between array or own  datastructures p  pWhen I would need a tree structure I wouldnt think twice an just write a tree. Are there any widely used libs with such structureslike boost for C  Or is this considered as bad style because you would have to store a void instead of the actual typep  pThank a lot for your experience p
Negative 17 pim trying to learn something about styles and themes for Android ive found that, if i add the androidtheme attribute in manifest for Application or Activity, style is applied to entire appactivity i think it would be useful to be able to define a style that is applied only to buttons, for example do you know if there is a way to apply a certain style only for a certain kind on Views, as in CSS p  pThanks in advance c.p
Negative 17 pI have an app with a codeUINavigationControllercode with a codetabBarControllercode and quite a few views.p  pMy two main views, that correspond to the two tabs, both show a nice codeMBProgressHUDcode when they are loading data.  This is triggered from codeviewDidLoadcode and only intended to be visible once.  Subsequent refreshes from the server do not use codeMBProgressHUDcode. p  pThe problem is, codeviewDidLoadcode is being called again in certain situations.  I believe this is because the view is unloaded because of memory constraints and then reloaded later, which triggers the code I only want to run on the first time. p  pMy question how can I ensure this is only called the first time they load the view, without trying to store a temporary count somewhere. All of my solutions seem horribly hacky. p  pThanksp

Negative 17 pIm working on a clientside Java application for which I want to create a webbased user interface which will be served up to a browser from the local app.  At the risk of oversimplifying, its a microblogging tool that will support functionality similar to Twitter and Facebook.

Negative 17 pMYSQL Databasep  pI have a table of data that I need to put into two tables.The one table contains persons and an animal. Every record is a person and an animal. I am chaning this to a multi table database  and want to group by the persons name, and then give the group an id like a customer id and then in my other table pass the customer ID to the idcustomer to join the two tables. To simplfy this i dont mind if these newly created ids are in the single table with new column names. I can after the fact export them out and import them.p  pThe question really is, how can I create a group by customer name, give that customer and ID and then use that same id in a column to do the join.p  pTo describe the schemep  pI have taken over a project. The database as of now is one table. In this one table isp  precodepersons name, address, childsname, description of child codepre  pWhat would like it to be at least to start with isp  precodeidperson, person name, childsname, childparent, description of child. codepre  pThe id of the person and the childsparent should be the same. When I break the table down, and put the child information in the child table, the child will have a parent id.p  pI still plan on having two tables. But I can export and create the tables, my problem is assiging the parent id to the child column with the current data.p  pAn example of a couple rows would bep  precodepersonname, address, childsname, description  mark twain, 23 st., Buckweat, short smart kid  mark twain, 23 st., Daniel, short kinda smart codepre  pInstead i would like to have 2 tables, one for the parents and the other table is their children.p  pThe way this database was setup, if one person has more than one child, there is another row that lists all of the same information.p  pWhat I have planned is to have multiple tables with a join. p  pThe original database has no index, or unique identifier. p  pWhat I want to do is loop through the records, since there is no unique id, if the customer name is identical, meaning they are listed twice, then they must have more than one child. p  pIn that case, i want to be able to go through the database and assign a id for the parents. and also ad another colum called parentid, which will be the child table.p
Negative 17 pI need to set the class for an element in my page.

But jQuery apparently only allows you use addClass or removeClass, like sop  precodefoo.addClassmyclass codepre  pThe problem is that it merely adds a class to the element, it does not replace the currently existing class. Does this mean I have to keep track of the old class and do a removeClass first Is there no way to tell jQuery to replace the current class no matter what it is and just replace it with a new onep

Now, when Im trying to import the whole history, git exits with an errorp  precodefatal Cannot lock the ref refsremotesfeaturebar. updateref m r4 refsremotesfeaturebar 471d9622546803b3712a436c2e2ed6b1490c829a command returned error 128 codepre  pI could do without the branch since it is way in the past anyway, but I do not want to loose all the history up to the point where the branch was merged. I tried the ignorepath option, but I cannot get it to work, mainly because I suspect it only addresses paths inside the branchtrunk path . Does anyone know by any chance a way to resolve this issuep
Negative 17 pI have a series of web parts I need to implement in SharePoint 2010.  The data provider web part uses an UpdatePanel and asynchronously makes a web service call which can potentially be slow.  To keep it simple, Ive put a single consumer web part on the page Chart which will use the consumer as its data provider.p  pMy problem is that I cant get the consumer to wait for the provider  I get a variety of errors but all basically come back to There is no data available.  This may be because it is a Chart web part but the question also applies to the other custom parts I will be developing as they will pull the same data.p  pThe question is how do I either push data to my consumers when my provider is ready or somehow let them wait for my provider to have data via polling or whatever.p  pNote this is just a prototype, I havent added error handling, etc yet.p  pCode is belowp  precode[ToolboxItemtrue] public partial class ClarityProjectGeneral  System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart , IWebPartTable       public DataTable ProjectVitals  new DataTable For web part communication       bunch of properties      protected override void OnInitEventArgs e              base.OnInite         InitializeControl           For web part communication          Initialize our datatable so the chart doesnt barf         DataColumn col  new DataColumn         col.DataType  typeofstring         col.ColumnName  Name         this.ProjectVitals.Columns.Addcol          col  new DataColumn         col.DataType  typeofDateTime         col.ColumnName  Start         this.ProjectVitals.Columns.Addcol          col  new DataColumn         col.DataType  typeofDateTime         col.ColumnName  End         this.ProjectVitals.Columns.Addcol           protected void PageLoadobject sender, EventArgs e              loading.Visible  true         content.Visible  false                       public ClarityObjectClasses.Projects GetProjectstring projectID              Clarity.ClarityAbstractorProject ca  new Clarity.ClarityAbstractorProjectthis.Username, this.Password         Dictionaryltstring, stringgt queryParams  new Dictionaryltstring, stringgt         queryParams.AddprojectID, projectID          Class for making web service call         ClarityObjectClasses.Projects response  new ClarityObjectClasses.Projects         response  ca.GetProjectqueryParams         return response           protected void Timer1Tickobject sender, EventArgs e              if this.ProjectID  null  this.Username  null  this.Password  null                      lblConfigError.Visible  true             lblConfigError.Text  One or more required configuration values are not set.

Negative 17 pDoes anyone know an algorithm to check which of two wild card expression is more general than the other  For example Id like to compare p  precodefoofoo.bar  codepre  pwith p  precode.bar codepre  pClearly the first expression is contained in the second. I know that is not possible for regex at least not if you dont have a looooot of time, as far as I remember this is in complexity class Non elementary, but it could be possible for wild card expression which are far less expressive. I tried to put together a simple python algorithm, but it gets very nasty when it comes to special cases. Anybody has an idea if there is an algorithm for that problemp  pUPDATEp  pI do not want to use any brute force algorithm, since this wont work in general, because of performance reasonsp  pRegards,p  pGeraldp

Negative 17 pI have appx. 2TB of text that I want to turn into a searchable database, where I will usually be searching to see if 24 word expressions exist in the database for instance I might do a search to see if the phrase these are four words, or three consecutive words appears anywhere in the text.p  pThese searches will happen very often so it is very important that I setup the database to use as little processing as possible. Id also want to minimize the overhead as much as possible so I can lower the amount of database servers Ill need.p  pDoes anybody have any suggestions as to how I should setup this databasep  pFor instance I was thinking of doing a linked list that was organized idword1word2 with all three beings keys so for the expression these are four words, Id first search these are, then Id search are four, check to see if any matches for these are are 1 id lower than are four, and then do the same thing for four words. But I think there has to be a more efficient way of doing it.p  pEDIT The ONLY thing I will be using this database for is doing these 24 word exact match searches, and it is meant for internal use. All I want this database to be able to do is let me know if a 24 word expression exists somewhere in all of my files of information, and nothing more.p

Negative 17 pI am a beginner user of linux, and also quite newbie at ssh and tunnels.p  pAnyway, my goal is to maintain a ssh tunnel open in background. p  pIn order to do that, I wrote the following batch that I then added into crontab the batch is automatically processed every 5 minutes during workdays and from 8am to 9pm. I read in some other thread in stackoverflow that one should use autossh that will ensure the ssh will always be ok through a recurrent check. So did I....p  precodebinbash LOGFILErootTunnellogBatchRestart.log NOWdate dmY  HM  date amp time of log  if  ps ax  grep ssh  grep tunnelToto ampgt devnull then     echo [NOW] ssh tunnel not running  restarting it gtgt LOGFILE     autossh f N L pppptunnelTotonnnnn nomprenom193.xxx.yyy.zzz p qqqq     if  ps ax  grep ssh  grep toto ampgt devnull     then             echo [NOW] failed starting tunnel gtgt LOGFILE     else             echo [NOW] restart successfull gtgt LOGFILE     fi fi codepre  pMy problem is that sometimes the tunnel stops working, although every thing looks ok ps ax  grep ssh   the result shows the two expected tasks  autossh main task and the ssh tunnel itself. I actually know about the problem cause the tunnel is used by a third party software that triggers an error as soon as the tunnel is no more responding. p  pSO I am wondering how I should improve my batch in order It will be able to check the tunnel and restart it if it happens to be dead. I saw some ideas in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1998297sshcheckifatunnelisalivetherea, but it was concluded by the autossh hint... which I already use. Thus, I am out of ideas... If any of you have, Id gladly have a look at themp  pThanks for taking interest in my question, and for your maybe suggestionsp

Negative 17 pIm playing around with XAudio2 to send PCM format waves to my soundcard, and I encountered a problem which made me think about this question. I created a .csv file with MATLAB of a sine wave at 440 Hz, and at first I had sampled it at 1 KHz for 1 second.p  pMy C program would then load that file and send the buffer to the soundcard. The problem is that the output was distorted clipped, and didnt sound like a sine wave at all. Then I thought, maybe the sound card doesnt like 1 kHz sampling rates, so I doubled it, and suddenly everything was fine.p  pIs there a way to confirm that this really was the problemp

Negative 17 pI have an application that uses LinqToSql, the problem came when I tried deploying the application to the server.

LinqToSql automatically autogenerates a connectionstring, so it tries to still use the connection string I am trying to reference to instead of letting me use the reference by my appsettings.It also has the connectionstring in the .dbml linq to sql file.

Negative 17 pIm working on a program that does OCR on a US business card and tries to return information like first name, last name, etc.  The challenge is how to do that.p  pSo far Ive built the following data filesp  precodefirstnames.txt  Contains 23k first names lastnames.txt Contains 86k last names jobtitle.txt Contains 500 job titles uscities.txt Contains 10k us cities statesfull.txt Contains full names of all US states statesabv.txt  Contains all US state abbreviations codepre  pThe goal was for me to tokenize the OCR data by spaces and try to award weight to each string based on the likeliness of it being a certain type of data.  p  pFor example, a string earlier in the text blob is more likely to be the name, company, or title.  Likewise, if a string is found in firstnames.txt or lastnames.txt, then it will have more weight towards firstlast name.p  pThis approach sounds ok in theory, but Im wondering about the best way to approach it from a programming perspective.  PHP, not that language matters  The tricky part is that some tokens weight are relative to other tokens.  For examplep  ul liIf a token seems likely to be a first name, then it is likely that the next token is a   last name.li liSome tokens are related to each other, but if things are exploded by spaces, Im not sure how to relate them.  Example, Anne Marie, FL would be considered three tokens  Anne, Marie, and FL.  Worse yet, Anne and Marie would gain weight towards being a first name.   Now, if weight is also awarded based on position, a previous string with first name weight could win, freeing these strings up to be detected as city.li ul  pI know theres a lot of smart people out there, so maybe someone has an idea on this onep

I am thinking that maybe i should include a new war file called common.war and include the shared static data. I think the other war files can access these files using the URL as they are static resources. rightp  pstrongShared classesstrongp  pThere are some classes that are shared globally. As an example, there is a class called codeUserSessioncode. When the user logson to the application, the UserSession object is created and stored in a Hashtable and the users session id as the key for the Hashtable.  Anytime a user tries to acess any part of the application, the session id is checked against the sesion ids in the Hashtable. p  pThe UserSession object does a number of things  such asp  ul liValidating user loginli liTrack users activityli liLog user login history to the databaseli liAnd more... li ul  pI need all war files applicationsmodules to have access to the codeUserSessioncode object but that only one is associated with each session. How should i architect this so that the users session spans across the different war files p  pI have been reading around about how to share objects and came up with two optionsp  ul liShared object via JNDIli liShared object via Tomcat ServletContextli ul  pAs i understand it, if an object is stored in the codeServletContextcode, it can be accessed by any application i.e. war file. How would this work though if i want a different instance per user session. For example, p  pUser1 logs on  UserSession stored in ServletContext User2 logs on  Where do i store User2s UserSession objectp  pAt the moment i store the sessionID in codeHTTPSessioncode and the codeUserSessioncode object in a HashTable. p  precodeHttpSession session  request.getSessiontrue UserSession userSession  getUserSessionsession.getId codepre  pDoes User1 get the same sessionId regardless of the war file heshe is accessing If so Could i Store another List object in codeServletContextcode that contains the sessionIDsp  pI have also seen references to object sharing using JNDI. I am not very familiar with JNDI. I have used JNDI for DataSources but that is as far as it goes.  How exactly would it work I would appreciate if someone can point me to an example showing how JNDI can be used for sharing data. Is it true that JNDI is the better approach and whyp  pAnd finally, where would the codeUserSession.classcode file reside I know i can put it in a jar file in codeTOMCATHOMElibcode but this is usually not recommended. The problem though is if it is in the codeWEBINFlibcode folder of one of the war files it cant be accessed by any other war file. p  pWould appreciate some inputsuggestions. I would be interested to know what strategy you use to deploy an application made up of multiple war files. p  pThanks p  h2Edith2  pOk i forgot to mention why i want to split the war file. Basically, we have several teams of developers. We have had situations where one team is working on a specific area of the application and another team is working on a different area. p  pFor example assume the following scenario  p  pTeam1 is working on the Forums module due to be released next month.  Team2 has been asked to deliver a change for the Articles and should be released next week. p  pIf Team1 has checked in their code and are performing systemintegration tests which will take more than a week, Team2 is stuffed as they have to wait. p  pThese kinds of problems are usually solved using Branching but we tend to avoid branching as it introduces a lot of complications with merging that we decided to avoid Branching. p  pThe other reason is that we have an older application that i am considering to reuse with this application. The older application based on pure HTTPServlet. I.e not based on any framework i.e. structs, spring etc. If i want to integrate it with my existing app i will need to use the sessionservletcontext. p  pAlso, a lot of people are skeptical of the fact that if you make a simple change e.g. you add a new stylesheet definition to a single css file, you have to rebuild and redeploy the whole application.  p  pOther reasons includep  ul liCould Simplify scalabilityload balancing  possibly Not sure about this one. I am thinking in terms of deploying each war file to a different servercluster. li liReduces PERMGEN memory requirementsli lietc...  li ul

Negative 17 pMy problem is as follows. I have 6 dataset collected from different days that I want to build a decision tree classifier for. I need to find the optimal tree depth parameter to avoid over fitting and have good prediction for new data.p  pMy first attempt was to split each dataset by 502525 into trainingvalidationtesting, and merged them into three big files. I produced a graph of accuracy vs tree depth, trained using the big training set and calculated the accuracy from the big validation set. However, I noticed the accuracy of the validation set kept increasing as the tree depth increased and never went down p  pThe accuracy reached around 99, at a tree depth of 20. Even the test sets accuracy was around 99. I assumed it had to be over fitting, based on my knowledge of the data. I confirmed this by removing one of the dataset, leaving only 5. I trained on the remaining 5 dataset using the same procedure as above, splitting into trainingvalidationtesting and training it at a depth of 20. This time I tested it against the dataset I left out and it produced a very poor result, accuracy in the low 50.p  pIt turns out my dataset has a lot of repetitive data due to the timeseries nature of it. To the point that sampling 2550 any of the dataset is probably equivalent to sampling 100, hence the over fitting. I decided to try a different strategy by randomly shuffling the 6 dataset and splitting them into trainingvalidation via 33, repeat it 20 times and average the results to find the optimal tree depth. Im still waiting for the result, should be done in a few days ...p  pSo my question finally is whether what I did is a sound method What other kind of emfunnyem data should I be aware of It seems like my dataset has a gotcha that I have seen mentioned anywhere.p

Negative 17 pI have a situation where the customer wants the special price to be rounded to the nearest whole number Example code1922.25 gt 1922.00code, code1256.85 gt 1257.00codep  pThis should be only for codeSpecial pricescode says the customer which means, if theres no special price for the product, the price should come as it is.p  pNote this is not only for display. This rule applies everywhere, even invoices. So is there a way to do this easily or we should only modify the core filesp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pIf we modify the core framework files like Product.php or Price.php, they will get overwritten with an update right So this should be a safe way too preferably.p

Negative 17 pI have been trying to get a grasp on how implicit parameters work in Scala. As far as I can tell the implicit parameter resolution goes something like thisp  ol liExplicitly passing an object to the method.li liimplicit definitons defined in scope.li liCompanion object of the class used as a implicit parameterli ol  pHowever, when I started playing around with this in conjunction lazy vals I got a bit of a supprise. It seems that lazy vals only ever use the last resolution rules. Here is some sample code to illustratep  precodeclass Barval nameString object Bar  implicit def bar  new Barsome default bar   class Foo    lazy val list  initialize   def initializeimplicit fBar       printlninitialize called with Bar   f.name   ...

Case 3 with local implicit parameter overriding the default one...  initialize called with Bar some default bar ...  initialize called with Bar locally scoped implicit bar ... codepre  pWhy does the compiler not catch that there is a implict Bar mixed in when calling mixedInList in Case 2. In Case 3 it also misses the locally defined implicit Bar when accessing the list. p  pstrongAre there any ways to use implicit parameters with lazy vals that does not use the implicit defined in the companion objectstrongp

Negative 17 pI have to construct a tree of processes using codeforkcode in C. I get a sequence of numbers from standard input for example 1 5 0 3 and those numbers tell me how many children each node has. If we take the example then the root process creates 1 child, then this one child creates 5 children of its own, then from those 5 children the first one doesnt create any children, the second one creates 3 of them and then were done. After this is complete the root process calls codepstreecode that draws out the tree.p  pHere is a picture of the examplep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comuUnVi.png altp  pMy question is how can I make new children from a specific node One needs to create 0 new processes and the next one needs to create 3 of them. I dont know how to distinguish so that only that specific child makes new children and not all of them. Also Im not sure how to use codepstreecode, because the tree is normally already gone when codepstreecode gets called.

Negative 17 pI write a code for a blognews site. Main page has 10 most recent articles and also there is an archive section with all articles sorted by modification time descending. In archive section I use pagination based on cursors and I cache results starting from the second page as pages are changed only when new article is published or existing goes to drafts for some reason. Every page has 10 articles. So when a user hits an archive page with some number not the first one memcache is checked for that page number results first. If the page is not there, memcache is checked for the cursor for that page and then results are fetched from datastore using that cursorp  precodeclass archivePage     def GETself, page         if not page             articles  memcache.getarchivePage             if not articles                 articles  fetchArticles                 memcache.setarchivePage, articles         else             if intpage  0 or intpage  1                 raise web.seeotherarchive             articles  memcache.getarchivePagepage             if not articles                 pageCursor  memcache.getArchivePageMappingpage                 if not pageCursor                     pageMapping  ArchivePageMapping.queryArchivePageMapping.page  intpage.get                     pageCursor  pageMapping.cursor                     memcache.setArchivePageMappingpage, pageCursor                 articles  fetchArticlescursorCursorurlsafepageCursor                 memcache.setarchivePagepage, articles codepre  pEvery time a new article is created or the status of an existing article is changed draftpublished I refresh the cache for archive pages results and cursors. I do it after saving an article to the datastorep  precodeclass addArticlePage          def POSTself         formData  web.input         if formData.title and formData.content             article  ArticletitleformData.title,                               contentformData.content,                               statusintformData.status             key  article.put             if intformData.status  1                 cacheArchivePages             raise web.seeotherarticles  key.id  def cacheArchivePages     articles, cursor, moreArticles  fetchArticlesPage     memcache.setarchivePage, articles     pageNumber2     while moreArticles         pageMapping  ArchivePageMapping.queryArchivePageMapping.page  pageNumber.get         if pageMapping             pageMapping.cursor  cursor.urlsafe         else             pageMapping  ArchivePageMappingpagepageNumber,                                             cursorcursor.urlsafe         pageMapping.put         memcache.setArchivePageMappingstrpageNumber, cursor.urlsafe         articles, cursor, moreArticles  fetchArticlesPagecursorcursor         memcache.setarchivePagestrpageNumber, articles         pageNumber1 codepre  pAnd here comes the problem. Sometimes there is no law, it happens randomly after refreshing the cache I get the same results and cursors for archive pages as before the refresh. For example I add a new article. It is saved in the datastore and it appears on the front page and on the first page in the archive the first page of the archive is not cached. But other archive pages are not updated. Ive tested my cacheArchivePages function and it works as expected. Could it be so that too little time has passed after I put an update to the datastore and before I fetchArticlesPage in cacheArchivePages function Maybe the write transaction didnt finish yet and so I get old results I tried to use time.sleep and wait a few seconds before calling cacheArchivePages and in that case I was not able to reproduce that behaviour, but it seems to me that time.sleep is not a good idea. Anyway I need to know the exact cause for that behaviour and how to deal with it.p

Negative 17 pI recently implemented a floating header on my website using CSS, but I would like to make it so that particular pages just have a normal header, as the nature of some pages do not warrant it. In the future or maybe at the same time Id like to give users the option to toggle the floating, if that makes sense.p  pBear with me here, Im still a PHPJavascript novicep  pSo, currently the header will stay visible at the top of the window, even when the user scrolls down the page, on all pages. However, there are pages where a floating header would be unnecessary. With other pages where it would be necessary, Id like users to have the option to toggle the floating header, as some people may not need quick access to the tool links in the header. Ideally, there would be a css button constantly visible in the topright corner, that says something like ViewHide Navbar or Stop following me Im more concerned with the actual functionality at the moment. SO regardless of whether the header is visible or hidden, that Toggle button would always need to be visible.p  pWhether I would give users the option to Toggle the header on all pages even on pages without the floating header, I dont know.

Negative 17 pAs what the document says, mysql does not allocate the full space you specify for varchar. It stores the actual length of data. So I guess there might also be side effects out there. Like if the original length of a varchar record is 10, Now I want to update it to 20 which still does not reach the specified limit 50. However, the space allocated previously is not enough now.  So my question is how MySQL deal with situation like this Will it take long to move everything following that record or does it have to do that Is there anyone can tell me how it works internally Thanks in advancep

Negative 17 pIm having a lot of trouble getting a good grasp on decorators despite having read many an article on the subject including [this][1] very popular one on SO.  Im suspecting I must be stupid, but with all the stubbornness that comes with being stupid, Ive decided to try to figure this out.p  pThat, and I suspect I have a good use case...p  pBelow is some code from a project of mine that extracts text from PDF files.  Processing involves three stepsp  ol liSet up PDFMiner objects needed for processing of PDF file boilerplate initializations.li liApply a processing function to the PDF file.li liNo matter what happens, close the file.li ol  pI recently learned about context managers and the codewithcode statement, and this seemed like a good use case for them.  As such, I started by defining the codePDFMinerWrappercode classp  precodeclass PDFMinerWrapperobject          Usage     with PDFWrapperpathtofile.pdf as doc         doc.dosomething          def initself, pdfdoc, pdfpwd         self.pdfdoc  pdfdoc         self.pdfpwd  pdfpwd      def enterself         self.pdf  openself.pdfdoc, rb         parser  PDFParserself.pdf   create a parser object associated with the file object         doc  PDFDocument   create a PDFDocument object that stores the document structure         parser.setdocumentdoc   connect the parser and document objects         doc.setparserparser         doc.initializeself.pdfpwd   pass  if no password required         return doc      def exitself, type, value, traceback         self.pdf.close          if we have an error, catch it, log it, and return the info         if isinstancevalue, Exception             self.logError             print traceback             return value codepre  pNow I can easily work with a PDF file and be sure that it will handle errors gracefully.  In theory, all I need to do is something like thisp  precodewith PDFMinerWrapperpathtopdf as doc     foodoc codepre  pThis is great, except that I need to check that the PDF document is extractable strongbeforestrong applying a function to the object returned by codePDFMinerWrappercode.  My current solution involves an intermediate step.p  pIm working with a class I call codePamplemoussecode which serves as an interface to work with the PDFs.  It, in turn, uses codePDFMinerWrappercode each time an operation must be performed on the file to which the object has been linked.p  pHere is some abridged code that demonstrates its usep  precodeclass Pamplemousseobject     def initself, inputfile, passwd, encutf8         self.pdfdoc  inputfile         self.passwd  passwd         self.enc  enc      def withpdfself, fn, args         result  None         with PDFMinerWrapperself.pdfdoc, self.passwd as doc             if doc.isextractable   This is the test I need to perform                  apply function and return result                 result  fndoc, args          return result      def parsetocself, doc         toc  []         try             toc  [level, title for level, title, dest, a, se in doc.getoutlines]         except PDFNoOutlines             pass         return toc      def gettocself         return self.withpdfself.parsetoc codepre  pAny time I wish to perform an operation on the PDF file, I pass the relevant function to the codewithpdfcode method along with its arguments.  The codewithpdfcode method, in turn, uses the codewithcode statement to exploit the context manager of codePDFMinerWrappercode thus ensuring graceful handling of exceptions and executes the check before actually applying the function it has been passed.p  pstrongMy question is as followsstrongp  pI would like to simplify this code such that I do not have to explicitly call codePamplemousse.withpdfcode.  My understanding is that decorators could be of help here, sop  ol liHow would I implement a decorator whose job would be to call the codewithcode statement and execute the extractability checkli liIs it possible for a decorator to be a class method, or must my decorator be a freeform function or classli ol

Negative 17 pI have a few scripts that I want to run overnight so Ive set up script triggers to execute these.  Its all pretty straightforward stuff and they run fine.  But occasionally, say once a month, one of them fails to execute.  No error messages are sent to me by Google or anything like that.p  pHas anyone else experienced this  Has anyone got any ideas I can check for this error  Obviously if its the actual trigger thats not firing in the first place then the code wont actually run and therefore it wont be able to run any checks.p  pIll also flag this with Google themselves in googleappsscriptissues forum.p

Negative 17 pThis used to be homework but now its personal as the term is over and Im still working on learning Swing components. This program is my attempt to lift a procedural console TicTacToe implementation into an applet in the simplest looking way possible, eschewing the traditional button grid for a single JTextField and submit button.p  pIt works fine through the first time, but after I reset the game with some logic in the init function this actually works, I was surprised, getText returns the empty string down at line 155 search on ARGH. Im basically taking shots in the dark at this point, so, if someone could have a look and critique, maybe point the way to the shortest route through this Id really appreciate it p  precode            TTTapp.java  TicTacToe       Implements a simple consolebased version of the classic       game Tic Tac Toe        author  Todd Howe       version 1.0       since 20120822           import java.awt.     import java.awt.event.     import javax.swing.     import java.util.ArrayList     import java.util.

Negative 17 pThe goal is to use php to FTP into a server and get the directory listings.  The only problem is that I need to use the absolute path to get to the directory.p  pExamplep  precodehost  example.com port  21 connection  ftpconnecthost, port  ftploginconnection, userA, password ftppasvconnection, true  users home directory is homeuserA printr ftpnlistconnection, logs works as intended printr ftpnlistconnection, homeuserAlogs does not work codepre  pThe really confusing part is that using the filesystem functions with an ftp url gives me the exact opposite problemp  precodeopendirftpuserApasswordexample.com21homeuserAlogs works opendirftpuserApasswordexample.com21logs does not work codepre  pSince the userdirectory is inputted by a user, I wont necessarily know if they want to use an absolute or relative home directory path.  I could use a simple strstr to check if the first character in the path is a  and choose which method to go with, but then I would end up writing twice as much code.  p  pTheres got to be an easier way to get some method to work with both absolute and relative paths.

Negative 17 pI developed a UI in NetBeans that I want to use in my Griffon application. I chose to do so because I dont have enough time to figure out how to get the screen laid out correctly using SwingBuilder. According to the book Griffon in Action, I basically just need to place the .java file created in NetBeans under the appropriate package in the src directory of my Griffon project and run the codegriffon generateviewscriptcode command with the fully qualified class name of the .java class it took me a while to figure out how to do that. It then generates a .groovy file in the views directory that contains some code wrapping the .java class to make it work with SwingBuilder. When I try to run this asis, nothing comes up. There are no exceptions being thrown, but nothing shows up either.p

Negative 17 pIm trying to write a ray tracer for any objects formed of triangular meshes. Im using an external library to load a cube from .ply format and then trace it down. So far, Ive implemented most of the tracer, and now Im trying to test it with a single cube, but for some reason all I get on the screen is a red line. Ive tried several ways to fix it but I simply cant figure it out anymore. For this primary test, Im only creating primary rays, and if they hit my cube, then I color that pixel to the cubes diffuse color and return. For checking rayobject intersections, I am going through all the triangles that form that object and return the distance to the closest one. It would be great if you could have a look at the code and tell me what could have gone wrong and where. I would greatly appreciate it.p  pRayTriangle intersectionp  precodebool intersectTriconst Vec3Damp rayorigin, const Vec3Damp raydirection, const Vec3Damp v0, const Vec3Damp v1, const Vec3Damp v2, double ampt, double ampu, double ampv const               Vec3D edge1  v1  v0           Vec3D edge2  v2  v0         Vec3D pvec  raydirection.crossedge2         double det  edge1.dotpvec         if det gt  THRESHOLD ampamp det lt THRESHOLD             return false         double invDet  1det           Vec3D tvec  rayorigin  v0         u  tvec.dotpvecinvDet         if u lt 0  u gt 1             return false         Vec3D qvec  tvec.crossedge1         v  raydirection.dotqvecinvDet         if v lt 0  u  v gt 1             return false         t  edge2.dotqvecinvDet         if t lt 0             return false         return true          Object intersection bool intersectconst Vec3Damp rayorigin, const Vec3Damp raydirection, IntersectionDataamp idata, bool enforcemax const               double tClosest         if enforcemax                      tClosest  idata.t                  else                      tClosest  TMAX                   for int i  0  i lt indices.size  i                      const Vec3D v0  vertices[indices[i][0]]             const Vec3D v1  vertices[indices[i][1]]             const Vec3D v2  vertices[indices[i][2]]             double t, u, v             if intersectTrirayorigin, raydirection, v0, v1, v2, t, u, v                              if t lt tClosest                                         idata.t  t                     tClosest  t                                        idata.u  u                     idata.v  v                      idata.index  i                                                return tClosest lt TMAX ampamp tClosest gt 0  true  false       Vec3D traceWorld world, Vec3D amprayorigin, Vec3D ampraydirection   Vec3D objColor  world.backgroundcolor IntersectionData idata double coeff  1.0 int depth  0  double tClosest  TMAX  Object hitObject  NULL    for unsigned int i  0  i lt world.objs.size  i             IntersectionData idatacurr     if world.objs[i].intersectrayorigin, raydirection, idatacurr, false               if idatacurr.t lt tClosest ampamp idatacurr.t gt 0                       idata.t  idatacurr.t             idata.u  idatacurr.u             idata.v  idatacurr.v             idata.index  idatacurr.index              tClosest  idatacurr.t                         hitObject  ampworld.objs[i]                if hitObject  NULL      return world.backgroundcolor  else      return hitObjectgtgetDiffuse    int mainint argc, char argv   parsecube.ply Vec3D diffusion11, 0, 0 Vec3D specular11, 1, 1 Object cube1coordinates, connectedvertices, diffusion1, specular1, 0, 0 World wrld  Add objects to the world wrld.objs.pushbackcube1 Vec3D background0, 0, 0 wrld.backgroundcolor  background  Set light color Vec3D lightclr1, 1, 1 wrld.lightcolors.pushbacklightclr  Set light position Vec3D light0, 64, 10 wrld.lightpositions.pushbacklight  int width  128 int height  128 Vec3D image  new Vec3D[widthheight] Vec3D pixel  image   Trace rays for int y  height2  y lt height2  y      for int x  width2  x lt width2  x, pixel              Vec3D raydirx0.5, y0.5, 1.0         raydir.normalize         Vec3D rayorig0.5width, 0.5height, 0.0         pixel  tracewrld, rayorig, raydir                   savePPM.test.ppm, image, width, height return 0   codepre  pIve just ran a test case and I got this p  pa hrefhttps17.postimage.org71y7pt60vtest.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comKpWNh.png width200ap  pfor a unit cube centered at 0,0, 1.5 and scaled on the X and Y axis by 100.

Negative 17 pIve been creating a game in XNA for the past couple weeks. In the process, I tried to solve a problem before I encountered it without fully understanding the problem.p  pThat problem was how I was going to deal with saving and retrieving blueprint objects. I need this functionality due to a content creator that Im making the game is contentbased. So the objective is, I create the content rough example, an enemy of type Goblin with 100 health and a goblin sprite, save it to a serialized object, load it in the game, and then it is usable and duplicable ingame. p  pNow obviously when objects have something nonserializable like a Texture2D the sprite, you cant serialize them. I solved that problem for both maps and objects with sprites items, NPCs, characters, etc by adding all my textures to a static class and only storing indices to the textures in the objects e.g., instead of containing a Texture2D property, the Goblin would contain an index linking to the appropriate texture  slightly oversimplified but you get the idea.p  pBut then the virus spread and I started doing that for all my object references. For example, the Goblin also needs a reference to an AI object. That AI object only has methods and as a result is clearly serializable, but I was storing it in the same static class as my textures and linking to it via index. Looking back on that now, I shudder as to what I was thinking.p  pSo my question is, should everything except textures be stored by direct reference in serializable classes, instead of reference by index Or is there ever a viable reason to do what Ive donep  pSerialization is a tricky business and Im trying to wrap my head around the best ways to use it and the right times to avoid it.p

I tried to get an last object from objects list in scene but theyre arranged alphabeticaly, so it didnt worked well.

All earlier instances of imported object are back to default. p  pHow to solve that problem Is there a option to get from scene last added object Or maybe some way to mark obj object right after it is imported before next functions are applied Or maybe there is a way to import obj data straight into created earlier blank object.p  pcheers,  reggp  pPS Working on Blender 2.63p

Negative 17 pI have 2 servers A and B running a glassfish 3.1.2.2 application server on them. Both use a JMS queue for communication, which works fine so far. If the network connection breaks for any reason, I can see in the logs of server B the one configured to connect to the remote queue of A that it tries to reconnect and is actually always successful in doing so as soon as A is up again.p  pBut the problem is, that if I try to restart the glassfish instance on B emwhileem server A is unreachable, the startup process will fail after some retries and remains stuck in a kind of undefinedunusable state, i.e. the java process is started, some ports are open but the applications are not started  not even the administration console.p  pIMHO glassfish startup process should not wait for the queues to connect, this should be done in some kind of background process.p  pHas anyone of you experienced something similar Is there anything I can configuretune to fix this behaviourp

Negative 17 pA little question to all you class designers and modelers.p  pSuppose you have a codeContentcode entity. It is defined by two interfaces, one for read only objects having only getters, one for write enabled objects also having corresponding setters. The write enabled interface extends the read only interface.p  pBoth interfaces have abstract implementations for certain common aspects. The abstract write enabled class extends the abstract read only class.p  pBelow the codeContentcode level there are more specific entities, lets call one of them codeItemcode. These entities are again modeled in two interfaces, one read only, one write enabled. The write enabled interface again extends the read only interface. Both codeItemcode interfaces extend the corresponding read only and write enabled codeContentcode interfaces.p  pNow heres the catch The actual implementations of the codeItemcode interfaces of course shall extend the abstract codeContentcode implementations to inherit their common behavior. But if they do so, the write enabled codeItemcode implementation cannot extend the read only implementation, effectively forcing code repetition to implement the codeItemcode getters.p  pHeres the problem expressed in UMLp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com0MPSu.png altProblemp  pA simple solution would be to introduce a delegate class providing the business logic for the read only part of the entity implementation and supplying both parties with an instance of this delegate. The getters in the entity implementing classes could then just forward their calls to the delegate.p  pHeres this solution expressed in UMLp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comFQpV2.png altSolution with a Delegatep  pWhat I dont like about this approach are the need for yet another class and the quite big code overhead it enforces.p  pIs there another more elegant or simpler solution Thank you for your ideas.p

Negative 17 pRewrote question with more infop  pI have some code that creates a codePathcode object using relative paths, like this codePaths.get.., folder.resolvefilenamecode. Later, I want to get the path string ..folderfilename from it Im on windows, so backslashes. When I run this code using manual compile or from Eclipse, this works fine.p  pHowever, when I run it using Maven, it doesnt work any more. The codetoStringcode method returns code[.., folder, filename]code instead of an actual path string. Using codepath.normalizecode doesnt help. Using codepath.toFile.getPathcode does return what Im looking for, but I feel there should be a solution using just the codenio.pathcode API.p

Negative 17 pIm working on an addon for strongFirefoxstrong using the strongSDKstrong previously known as Jetpack.p  pIn my addon I need to access some data via strongJSONPstrong requests to a PHP script on a remote server which Im in control of, and then use the data returned from the server to update certain web page elements.p  pIn my main.js file I use a pagemod and strongcontentScriptFilestrong to inject a copy of the JQuery library, and my own javascript file into the web page. My javascript file uses JQuerys .ajax function to access the remote PHP script.p  pThe problem the responses are never received.p  pI stumbled across this StackOverflow question, which deals with the same issue a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7973643errorinjsonpcallonlyfromfirefoxextensionerror in jsonp call ONLY FROM firefoxextensionap  pIve followed some of the advice there, and changed my .ajax request by specifying my own callback, and added the callback function to my file using unsafeWindow.callback  I dont fully understand whats happening, but it seems the window reference acquired by JQuery is not the the same as the real underlying window object I thought this sort of thing was meant to be handled invisibly by the XRayWrapper, so confused about that.p  pThats OK. I get a single parameter passed to my callback Ive labelled the parameter data, which contains the entire server response  everything that I need.p  pThe problem is, when I was previously using strongsuccessstrong within the .ajax function, this referred to the ajax object I think  Javascript beginner, and thence to the page element I wanted to update with the response data. I lose access to this in my custom callback.p  pWhat Ive found is that even though I always get a response from the server, and my callback fires, JQuery reports an error  if I specify strongerrorstrong, then this will fire. If I add a strongcompletestrong, this fires too, but strongsuccessstrong never fires.p  pI thought that I could use complete in place of my custom callback, but it appears that when the error handling code is invoked, it wipes out the server response  I cant access it in complete The XHR object .responseText property is undefined by the time processing reaches complete.p  pSo, my cobbled together solution to all of this is as follows. I have my custom callback, which is passed the full server response. I store this in a global variable. I specify complete  which fires next or later  and then access the global variable from there, but ALSO have access to the page element I want to update via this.p  pThis concerns me because several AJAX requests may be made in quick succession, so my solution depends upon there being no interleaving of response handling  in other words, Im making an assumption which I dont know to be true that when a response is received by JQuery, it will fire all of the event handlers for that response before beginning processing of the next received response. If this ISNT so, then the data I store in my global variable may not correspond to the page element I want to use it with in success. It seems to be working so far in testing, but it may just be that Ive been lucky.p  pSide note I also use QTip2, and its AJAX plugin  that always throws an error too, and not a silent one. But I found I could suppress this by adding error and setting the xhr.status  0  Ill post a snippet below.p  pBut this seems like such a horrible messy way of doing things. I dont understand why JQuery thinks theres been an error when the server response is received successfully. And its very inconvenient that its error handling destroys this response which means I cant get at it in success.p  pDoes anyone have a neater solution Thank you in advance  snippets to follow by the way, these problems ONLY exist when I do all of this within my addon.

Negative 17 pThe question title seems a little bit odd doesnt it. Anyway. So I have one base class which has some private fields, protected properties and a single constructor that takes one argument and I have several sub classes of that base class. whenever any of those subclass methods are called the sub classes are required to be instantiated and after the method is done executed the object is destroyed so if the method will be called again new instance of the class should be made. Its a WCF service Now, the thing I want to do is the following. whenever the certain sub class constructor is called I call the base class constructor explicitly with some certain parameter different for every sub class, Note no sub class methods are the same, When the base class constructor is called I want to check something according to that argument and if it passes the check then I want to allow the execution of sub class method. In any other case I want it NOT to run the sub class method. So I want something like this. when the method is called the sub class has to be constructed and for that, base class has to be constructed as well and if the check fails in the base class constructor I want to prevent that method from running. I can just have a bool property and  set it in base class constructor and check it on every method call. but I want to make something more general. May be the way that Im suggesting Is not right either. So you understand what I want I guess. Any suggestion would be appriciated. thanks in advancep  precodeclass BaseClass      private bool isValid      private SomeService someService      public BaseClassSomeEnum value              someService  new SomeService          if someService.Validatevalue                      isValid  true                    protected internal bool IsValid  get  return isValid     class SubClass  BaseClass       object declaration     public SubClass   baseSomeEnum.SomeValue               constructing some objects here           public Response OperationparametereGoHere              if IsValid                       perform operation. construct Response object and return it                     other methods omitted.  codepre  pSo whenever the codeOperationcode method is called codeSubClasscode has to be constructed which causes the codeBaseClasscode to be constructed and the base class sets the value of codeisValidcode which is then use to check for validity, but I wanted to make something more general. lets that instead of just setting the value of codeisValidcode to true just do nothing or set some other properties and if the codeValiatecode failed just stop the execution and dont to anything at all. In this case the calling routing wouldnt be able to call codeOperationcode if we somehow managed to stop the construction of class. If its not possible Im perfectly happy with the solution I have right now. But if it is I will be glad to see that. Note In every sub class, methods are different and I have to check codeIsValidcode to allow the execution of method.p
Negative 17 pI am writing a safari class from my current OOP course. The safari has tigers, lions, and giraffes. The animals are derived from base class Animal. Now, I supposed to implement a CountTigers routine. However, I am supposed to do this without changing the lion and giraffe classes. This project has many other aspects GUI, animal deletion, menus etc., mouse events   some I may be able to do this inadvertently. p  pNow, the CountTigers routine should be included in the Safari class, which has a list of all the animals within the safari. My goal was to iterate through the list of animals, and to check if the current Animal is a Tiger and return a value representing the number of Tigers. I can do this easily by including a virtual function in my Animals class and implementing it only in the Tigers class. p  precodeClass Animal   ....   virtual bool IsTiger  Class Tiger public Animal   ....   virtual bool IsTigerreturn true codepre  pI can now iterate through the list of animals and check IsTiger on each animal. My question is, because I have declared a virtual function in Animal, am I changing the giraffe and lion classes even without implementing the virtual functionp

Negative 17 pIve been having some difficulty customizing a responsive navigation jQuery plugin called a hrefhttpadnantopal.github.ioslimmenu relnofollowslimMenua. I have set up a jsFiddle a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netnickpishNmh9Z relnofollowherea. Ultimately, Id like to create a responsive header in which the h1 logo is floated to the left of a container i.e. header, and the navigation links are floated to the right. Upon triggering the collapsed menu here Ive set a breakpoint of 600px in the plugin initialization p  precodeul.slimmenu.slimmenu     resizeWidth 600  codepre  pwhich you can see by changing the width of the results pane in jsFiddle Id like the dropdown list items to fill the viewport at 100 width as Ive illustrated in this diagram p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comj9NzV.png altresponsive nav menu diagramp  pThis plugin is set to show text next to the hamburger menu icon when triggered in this case its Menu but Id like no text to be shown and just have the Logo header persist floated at left. Im suspecting that problem lies in floating the header amp nav elements and perhaps they need to be positioned within a container and make mediaquerytargeted adjustments to the list items  but my attempts in this vein have not worked.p  pThanks for any assistance here. Ill gladly buy anyone a coffee for anyone who finds a solution p

Now, i know that since im create Manager classes i could just use campp the code, but i was wondering, is there a way that i can code this in the EntityManager class and have all the managers inherit the method but using the concrete classes p  psomething like this In EntityManager classp  precode public TEntity Getint id              return set.WhereT.IDid          codepre  pThats basically what i want a way to use these properties at the base class EntityManager where they matter methods deletebyid, get and getall in a way that all Manager classes ManagerVenue in the example inherit these methods so that i wont have to write them all over and over got some 100 entities p

Made codeListenercode instance inside codeListenercode class codestaticcode and have codestatic Listenercode constructor initialize singleton codeListenercode object. Also have codestatic Listener getListenercode which returns singleton codeListenercode instance.p  pI am receiving a SOAP on this port which my listener callback method is processing.p  pNow I want date time of last notification pushed to my UI.p  pSo what I thought is somehow while initializing codeListenercode I will pass a delegate, a reference to which will be stored inside codeListenercode and then every time I receive a notification, inside listener callback I will call that delegate and pass it current time codenew DateTimecode, which will do necessary task of printing message with time. I also thought of making delegate parameter optional so that if delegate is codenullcode it will not be called at all on notification. However since I made constructor private, I am not able to figure it out how I can pass delegate to it.p  pTo summarize and generalize the whole question How to pass a parameter to be stored as a instance member to singleton classp  pShould I pass delegate to codegetListenercode and inside it check everytime if delegate is null and if not, set it But then if I am accessing this singleton object too many times by calling codeListener.getListenercode, everytime it will unnecessarily check the delegate is codenullcode. In fact thats why I moved initializing codeListenercode to static constructor just to avoid checking if codeListenercode is initialized everytime codegetListenercode is called.p  pWhat should I do to pass parameter to singleton class Or this checks in codegetListenercode inevitable p  pstrongNotestrong I dont know but this question may boil down to how can we pass parameters to static constructor since we need to initialize things first time the class is used and we have to initialize it with delegateother programmatic construct thus we cannot load initialization parameters from some config file inside static constructor.p

Need to scan the whole table and process a subset of the rows based on a specific value.p  pNow there are two options of how to keep the value br 1. value is the value of a column column X  valuebr 2. value is the column qualifier.  p  pIn option 1 using a column value scanning and filtering according to the value will use SingleColumnValueFilter.br In option 2 it will use QualifierFilter that should only check for the existence of the qualifier.p  pThe question is whether theres a performance difference between these two options. Is the QualifierFilter supposed to have better performance Is checking for a qualifier existence is less expensive than checking for the column value p
Negative 17 pIm using jqGrid with the sortableRows option.br I also use inline editing of rows once rows are added to the grid. Its working for me OK in Chrome, but then I tried it in FireFox and I find that inline editing doesnt work.  Clicks on any of the editable grid cells are ignored.p  pI traced the problem down to the fact that on mousedown event clicks happen with grid cells that the handler uidisableSelection gets called in Firefox but not in Chrome.  As a test, I forced the uidisableSelection handler to not be called on mousedown click over a cell, and then inline editing works as expected.p  pBased on that, I searched and found that something like this problem has been reported in jQuery  Im using version 1.6.2p  pa hrefhttpforum.jquery.comtopicjqueryuisortabledisableselectionfirefoxissuewithinputs relnofollowhttpforum.jquery.comtopicjqueryuisortabledisableselectionfirefoxissuewithinputsap  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4027158jqueryuisortablehandlingdisableselectiononforminputsjqueryUI Sortable handling .disableSelection on form inputsap  pa hrefhttpbugs.jqueryui.comticket4429 relnofollowhttpbugs.jqueryui.comticket4429ap  pThe last two posts offer some possible solutions.

Since this DLL is known to work and my DLL does not work, I think this has something to do with it.p  pThe DLL that works uses codedeclspecdllexport stdcallcode on its exported functions. Note that I only have the source code of the good DLL. I know it works because I have the DLL file itself, which I havent compiled myself. As far as I know this was compiled in the Borland IDE, so its probably an Eclipse specific problem herep  pDoes anyone know what might be wrong andor how I can make the DLL work properlyp  pstrongEDITstrong I should point out Im using Eclipse IDE, with MINGW compiler.p

Negative 17 pI am writing a small application in python 2.7 using pygame in which I would like to smoothly display animated tiles on screen. I am writing on Ubuntu, but target platform is Raspberry Pi if thats relevant. The challenge is that the textures for these animated tiles are stored on a web server and are to be loaded dynamically over time, not all at once. Id like to be able to load these images into pygame with no noticeable hitch in my animation or input response. The load frequency is pretty low, like grabbing a couple jpgs every 30 seconds. I am willing to wait a long time for the image to load in the background if it means the main inputanimation thread remains unhitched.p  pSo using the multiprocessing module, I am able to download images from a server asynchronously into a buffer, and then pass this buffer to my main pygame process over a multiprocessing.queues.SimpleQueue object. However, once the buffer is accessible in the pygame process, there is still a hitch in my application while the buffer is loaded into a Surface for blitting via pygame.image.frombuffer.p  pIs there a way to make this pygame.image.load call asynchronous so that my animation in the game, etc is not blocked I cant think of an obvious solution due to GIL.p  pIf I was writing a regular OpenGL program in C, I would be able to asynchronously write data to the GPU using a pixel buffer object, correct Does pygame expose any part of this API by any chance I cant seem to find it in the pygame docs, which I am pretty new to, so pardon me if the answer is obvious. Any help pointing out how pygames terminology translates to OpenGL API would be a big help, as well any relevant examples in which pygame can initialize a texture asynchronously would be amazingp  pIf pygame doesnt offer this functionality, what are my options Is there a way to do this is with PySDL2p  pEDIT Ok, so I tried using pygame.image.frombuffer, and it doesnt really cut down on the hitching I am seeing. Any ideas of how I can make this image load truly asynchronous Here is some code snippets illustrating what I am currently doing.p  pHeres the async code I have that sits in a separate process from pygamep  precodedef workerinqueue, outqueue     done  False     while not done         if not inqueue.empty             obj  inqueue.get              if a bool is passed down the queue, set the done flag             if isinstanceobj, bool                 done  obj             else                 url, w, h  obj                  grab jpg at given url.

Negative 17 pI am using a HTML5 Video Gallery that utilizes embedded YouTube videos. The gallery was working fine until last week.  I am using the gallery with the video list being populated by PHP query and echo.  p  pGallery link a hrefhttpcodecanyon.netitemresponsivevideogalleryhtml5youtubevimeo2918602 relnofollowhttpcodecanyon.netitemresponsivevideogalleryhtml5youtubevimeo2918602ap  pAs of last week the gallery is buggyhangs and will not load all the videos every time the page is refreshed.  When I use the gallery with just hard code youtube video list and not the PHP query and echo the gallery works fine.  It seems like the problem is directly related to the PHP query.p  pI am guessing that youtube changed the API or something.  Nothing appears to have changed on my side of the code.p  pMy questions is, do you think using JSON to populate my gallery video list will fix the problem as the code works fine with hard codep  pThanks for you inputp  pJasonp
Negative 17 pNew to Yesod, Javascript and web programming in general, I dont really know where to start looking.

Negative 17 pSimply put why there is no overload for codeoperatorltltcode of codebasicostreamcode and standard containers like codevectorcode or codepaircode. Like there is for codestringcode.p  pIt would be so easy if there would be a standard way to print these objects.p  hr  pI wondered for a long time why this is simply as a curiosity and laziness to write such an operator for every little program where I wanted to quickly output a vector. But now I encountered a strongreal problemstrong caused by thisp  pI am implementing a library. I have an exception class codeutilsexceptionOutOfRangecode. The constructor takes as an argument an object representing the codekeycode that is out of range. I use codestringstreamcode and other stuff to create a comprehensive error messagep  precodetemplate ltclass Keygt inline OutOfRangeOutOfRangeconst Key ampkey  Exception2    just the interesting part a simplified version   stringstream message   message ltlt accessed at keyindex ltlt key  lt there must be an operatorltlt for key  codepre  pFor a codevector like containercode, the codekeycode can be an codeintcode so everything is fine. For a codemap like containercode the codekeycode can be anything, but this requires that there has to be such an codeoperatorltltcode. But it kind of makes sense to force the user to have an codeoperatorltltcode if he wishes to throw an codeOutOfRangecode object. Is that OKp  pstrongThe real dilemmastrong came from this Now I implement a codeMatrixcode class within the same library that throws codeOutOfRangecode. The codeKeycode for this is a codestdpairltint, intgtcode. So I am responsible to provide an codeoperatorltltcode for codestdpaircode. But it doesnt seem OK that including a header that defines a codeMatrixcode class will also bring silently and unrelatedly an overload for codeoperatorltltostream, stdpaircode. Conflicts can appear if the user also has such an overload.p  pI feel like all this could easily be avoided if there were such operators in the standard library for the containers defined in the standard library.p  pAm I missing something Is my approach to create the message wrongp  psubApologies if my questions are all over the palace. I tried to tied them all together in a rounded and logical way, dont know how much I succeeded.subp

Negative 17 pAt my university I have to measure the overhead of the serialization of C STL types that are sent using MPI. p  pMeasuring the time is easy, but I have a problem if I would want to measure for example how much bytes is needed to send a codevectorcode of 1000 chars and array of 1000 chars for example.

Negative 17 pBackground I have a TeamCity installation with dozens of build configurations. Many of these build configurations deploy to the same servers. To alleviate any conflicts, I used TeamCitys shared resources feature to control how these builds run. All the builds that deploy to one particular server require a write lock for the same shared resource thus, they wont try to deploy to the same server at the same time.p  pOver the weekend we had a hard crash due to a power outage. The crash happened while a build, which had a write lock on a shared resource, was running. Now it appears that write lock never got released. None of the builds that use that shared resource can runthey all just queue up. If I disable the resource and then reenable it, a build will run, but the next time it will just queue up again.p  pI would really rather not delete and recreate these shared resources each one is used by 69 build configurations, and reassigning them all would be a huge headache. How to I clear the unreleased write lockp

Negative 17 pPlease consider these sceanriosp  ol liAn async .ashx handlerli liA async .asmx webservice methodli liA sync MVC 5 controller action methodli ol  pI am trying to figure out a way to set logical thread specific data that can be accessed consistently during a logical http request, i.e. if the data was set on the thread in the BeginExecute part of whichever async handler you would consider, that data is available in the EndExecute part of that asnc handler even if ASP.NET executes the EndExecute part on a different OS.Net thread.p  pMoreover, I am expecting that the data set in the BeginExecute part on whatever OS.Net thread it was on is NOT available on a subsequent http request if the second request is assigned the thread that was earlier assigned to first http request when it was in BeginExecute portion but this thread freed up as the first http request went in its async operation and its possibly still completing its async operation.p  pI believe the word logical thread or logical thread context in .Net actually means the same logical flow of operation that I have mentioned and not the underlying OS.Net thread that keeps getting reassigned. If you look at it from a workflow perspective, each http request is a new logical operation even if multiple users invoke the same webservice sequentially or in parallel, each request is a new and separte logical operation, and in this meaning, the logical operation is onetime and cannot repeat. However the same underlying OS.Net threads can be mapped to logical operations as they arrive based on their availability.p  pAdditionally I want to expose this data as HttpContext.Current sort of static property. To some people this may come as a surprise, but HttpContext.Current does not work correctly if you are using for example async .asmx webservice methods. I am sure I have read content on web which says HttpContext.Current should always return correct HttpContext, but I have seen it as null in EndExecuteMethod of .asmx webmethods. It would be great if somecan can confirm if I am right in making my last statement, but this statement is not the overall question I am trying to ask here.p  pAfter reading a good amount of literature e.g. a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3841075whatisthedifferencebetweenlog4netthreadcontextandlog4netlogicalthreadcoWhat is the difference between log4net.ThreadContext and log4net.LogicalThreadContexta, a hrefhttpmsmvps.comblogsjonskeetarchive20101108theimportanceofcontextandaquestionofexplicitness.aspx relnofollowhttpmsmvps.comblogsjonskeetarchive20101108theimportanceofcontextandaquestionofexplicitness.aspxa, a hrefhttpblog.stephencleary.com201304implicitasynccontextasynclocal.html relnofollowhttpblog.stephencleary.com201304implicitasynccontextasynclocal.htmla and more including MSDN docs, here are my inferencesp  ol liThreadStatic is local to underlying OS.Net thread and not to the logical operation, hence in my example data set on first http request in BeginExecute would be visible in next http request if the second http request gets assigned the same thread as BeginExecute for first thread. And this data wont be available in EndExecute if it happens to be reassigned to another thread by .Net which would happen in vast majority of the cases.li liThread.SetData is even more problematic for my usecase. It needs data slots to be passed in and if I were to pass in a data slot from a return value of Thread.GetNamedDataSlot, the information is available across the app domain as named data slots are shared between threads.li liCallContext.SetData is like ThreadStatic which means its not shared by app domain but different http requests would see the same data if they get assgined to the same underlying OS.Net thread. CallContext.SetData provides an additional ability to marshal the context data for RPC calls which is irrelevant to the current question being asked.li liThen theres the ThreadLocal class .Net 4.Net 4.5. It could have solved one part of my problem it seems, I could have passed it inside stateObject of BeingExecute operation, and extract from the same stateObject parameter of endExecute operation. From this perspective, ThreadLocal seems to be written for .Nets async support. But it wont work when I need to access it like HttpContext.Current as theres no way I can see to preserve the logical thread static instance ofit unless I have said something incorrectly in my previous 3 points.li liAnd finally it seems CallContext.LogicalSetData does what I intend to achive. Using the set of CallContext.LogicalSetData and CallContext.LogicalGetData methods, I should be able to achieve the HttpContext.Current like impact which works correctly for logical task executions.li ol  pNow come the questionsp  ol liIs everything I have said above correct. Please correct any and all incorrect claims I have made.li liAre there any other options available for thread static kind of feature in .Net that I missed.li liDoes CallContext.LogicalSetDataLogicalGetData pass on the context data to RPC calls the msdn page does not mention clearly, a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.runtime.remoting.messaging.callcontext.logicalsetdata28vvs.11029.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.runtime.remoting.messaging.callcontext.logicalsetdatavvs.110.aspxa.li liAre there any downsides performance wise or otherwise of using CallContext.LogicalSetDataLogicalGetData.li liThis page says something about copyonwrite behavior for LogicalSetData a hrefhttpblog.stephencleary.com201304implicitasynccontextasynclocal.html relnofollowhttpblog.stephencleary.com201304implicitasynccontextasynclocal.htmla. In the context of async handlersasync MVC 5 action methods, whats the impact if I save a reference type using logicalsetdata and later change the state of the reference type. What are the repuccursions.li liFor mutationlogicalsetdataasync, I still cant see whats the problem by mutating the object. When the async method starts, the copyonwrite behavior would trigger a copy of context data the next time logicalsetdata is called. This is a shallow copy, so my reference object is now actually shared by 2 logical contexts and the changes in one context are visible in the other context which is what I would normally expect from a reference type.li ol  pA long question with lots of references, but hopefully I did my research well and the answers would benefit other people too.p

Is it possible to do that with FOXX too p  pIn Nodejs there is a javascript driver that does IO to Arango in nonblocking style.p  pThen there are transactions in ArangoDB. There is also blocking.

Negative 17 pI currently use this code to randomly sort my list of items and it works quite wellp  precodedocument.readyfunction   function       .fn.randomize  function childElem          return this.eachfunction               var this  this             var elems  this.childrenchildElem             elems.sortfunction                   return Math.roundMath.random  0.5                          this.removechildElem             for var i  0 i lt elems.length i             this.appendelems[i]               jQuery  function       if window.location.href.indexOfst gt 1        else          itemBlock.randomize.list1      jQuery   codepre  pHowever, I am stumped when it comes to figuring out a way to modify this script to randomly return results in a certain order. For instance, the list I use this with returns all of a specific type of item from all of 5 stores. So if someone is looking for an apron it will show all of the aprons we have at each of our 5 stores. p  pThe code above surely randomizes the list, but I dont know how to take into account the store location. p  pSo right now a search for aprons would initially return from stores A, B, C, D, and E a list like thisp  pBCDAEBCDDDCEABBACACABCDAAp  pBut what we want to achieve is a return like thisp  pABCDEABCDEABCDEABCDEABCDEp  pNot necessarily in exactly that order but someway to modify the function so that a result from each store is loaded before more results are loaded. So there wouldnt be 3 in a row from one store, or one store would be represented more than others. p  pDo I go about this by using the filter or sort function Or would pure javascript handle this more efficientlyp

If more than one character is added, then the second one, and any after that, is printed.p

Negative 17 pI was wondering I have a code1 row, 4 columncode plot. However, the first three subplots share the  same codeyaxescode extent i.e. they have the same range and represent the same thing.

Negative 17 pRegarding the MM flagp  blockquote   pInstead of outputting the result of preprocessing, output a rule   suitable for make describing the dependencies of the main source file.   The preprocessor outputs one make rule containing the object file name   for that source file, a colon, and the names of all the included   files, including those coming from include or imacros command line   options.p blockquote  pThe version of clang Im using is part of the Android NDK and as such uses Windowsstyle paths, rather than Cygwinstyle paths. Using the codeMMcode flag, clang is outputting the name of an included files as an absolute, Windowsstyle path which has a colon after the drive letter, thus breaking the syntax that Cywgins GNU Make is expecting.p  pI could adjust the paths after clang outputs it and before make uses it, but this seems like a hack, as the codeMMcode flag is not producing appropriate output a valid make rule. Is there a flag or environment variable to correct this behaviorp

Negative 17 pIm about to embark on trying to add a profile picture field to my User entity in a symfony2 project Im working on which uses codeFOSUserBundlecode.

Ill then create an event listener for either codeFOSUserEventsPROFILEEDITSUCCESScode or codeFOSUserEventsPROFILEEDITCOMPLETEDcode, which will take the form, handle the file upload and persist the path of the uploaded file with methods to get the public URL and absolute path to my User object, before adding a message to the Response flashbag to say it was either successful or unsuccessful. Is this really the correctbest practice way to do this Or am I missing something Is this functionality really not included yet in the FOSUserBundle If so Ive not found the docs for it, but would love it if it was....p  pAny help  tips  voodoo advice would be so greatly appreciatedp

Negative 17 pI am new to web dev and Ruby on Rails.  I chose IntelliJ13.1.5 with ruby plugins since I also have worked with Java apps for many years for saving a lot of typing.

There are many warnings about Cannot find xxxpath for my sample code below though the tests do run fine.p  precode    get loginpath codepre  pI understand it could be hard for IDE to work with a framework in dynamic language with built in magic.

Is there anyone else have the same problem with intelliJ minitest classes for route definition  Do you get it work properly in Intellij or RubyMine  Thanks.p

Negative 17 pI am rather lost how to implement AWS auto scaling in my usage scenarion I have an EC2 instance with elastic IP,  in VPC as my webserver . This elastic IP is mapped to my website address in R53. Now if I create auto scaling group with the same AMI, which I used to create my first ec2 instance, with say two instances, then two new instances are created with new IP addresses. How these new instances can  share the traffic If I delete the original instance, and use IP address of one of these instances in R53, how can I ensure that this perticular instance whose IP address I am using in R53, will survive after scale downp

Negative 17 pCurrently I have an app that is only for iPhone, targeting the iOS 7 SDK. I started migrating to iOS 8 and making it an app for both iPhone and iPadwith universal storyboard. However there are some cases where you cant use size classes yet. All my fonts are custom and setting them to bigger sizes for iPad doesnt seem to work.  I could check the trait collections user interface idiom for each view and set a bigger font.

Negative 17 pI am coming to you at great despair  been working on this for two days now.p  pWe have a Single Page Application built with Angular JS. We use the routeProvider in HTML5 mode to achieve the SPA routing. Functionality wise  all works greatp  pWe have one global controller attached to the body element, there is one controller in the header for a quick search functionality and all other controllers are scoped to a route. There is some data shared between controllers like a currentUser object and a ViewRes object that contains string values for users chosen language. p  pBut, we noticed that the Chrome service takes too much RAM for our page. I used Chrome Profiles tool to see what is happening. I disabled most of our code that was using a complex directive and left out only the basics. Memory consumption was lowered a lot, but it is still obviously there. Any time I change a page, the memory increases. p  pIn the Heap Snapshot it shows that most memory is taken by closure and array. Also the Detached DOM tree is big. Please note that these snapshots are with bare elements of our application header, footer and lightweight content. If I include our complex UI components, then memory jumps from 14MB to 50MB to 140MB... and more. Obviously we will take care for these directives, but I am concerned that our issue is global, not just to bad design of the directives.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comwuWRg.jpg altAll profilesp  pWhen I open the array element, I notice there are bunch of them with both shallow size and retained size of 6172. Tracking the scope of that object always leads to some ng directive, like ngShow, ngIf... p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comhzPxz.jpg altcache in functionp  pAs you can see from the image, the tree ends at cache in function. We use Angular 1.3.6. p  hr  pEDIT This project also includes jQuery. We were using jQuery 1.8.2 and when I switched to 1.11.2, switching between simple pages simple ngrepeats and simple models doesnt cause memory leaks anymore no more detached DOM elements.p  pNow the complex directives are still giving me too much detached elements, so I am going to work on those now and Ill post the results here when I find out the cause.p  hr

Negative 17 pI have two Spring Boot applications, to be more precise, the one is a Spring YARN application currently for my tests, I use the one from a hrefhttpsspring.ioguidesgsyarnbasicsingle relnofollowthis tutoriala, and another one which is meant to provide a REST interface. I want to be able to submit the YARN application to my Hadoop cluster via the REST interface. So I added the Spring YARN application as a dependency to my REST application. Now I have the problem that when I start my REST application, the Spring YARN client is found, too, which causes it to be started, and that fails as expected. My question is now How can I tell Spring Boots codeEnableAutoConfigurationcode to ignore the Spring YARN applicationp  pI tried the following things without successp  ul liSpecified the base packages in codeComponentScancode they are disjoint for both applicationsli litried to exclude classes the Spring YARN application tries to initialize as of codeEnableAutoConfigurationexclude...code ul lithe main class of my Spring YARN applicationli licodeCommandYarnClient.classcodeli licodeSpringYarnClientConfiguration.classcodeli ulli lispecified different profiles to be active  codeyarncode for my Spring YARN application and coderestcode for my REST applicationli ul  pIs what I am trying to do impossible, or is there some trick behindp
Negative 17 pIve started learning java.  Ive understood so far that method calls arep  precodeobject.methodnamearguments codepre  palthough I think more broadly Ive discovered that its actuallyp  precodereceiver.methodnamearguments codepre  pand that a receiver might not necessarily be an object.  or perhaps my understanding of object is wrong.  I get that a class defines a type, and an object is an instance of the class.  And that calling a method is sending a message to an object, and the message has to be something the object understands as defined by the methods in its class.p  pBut... what aboutp  precodeimport java.lang.Math double x  16 double y  Math.sqrtx double z  Math.powx,y codepre  pis Math an object  I dont believe so.  My understanding so far is that Math is a package class in the java.lang package.  I dont yet really understand what a package class is other than that its some kind of prewritten library of functions I can use...p  pBut if its a class, then that means sometimes a receiver can be a class and doesnt necessarily have to be an object...p  p...or is Math an objectinstance of some other classp  pIve googled every combination of javareceiverobjectclassetc that i can think of and cant find anywhere that really clears this up for me.  Id appreciate any insights anyone can offer me to clear it up.p  pThanksp

Negative 17 pIts interesting how a table cell wont adapt to your resized image when you resize it by percentages.

The columns are codeidcode UUID, data for the actual config, and codedatepublishedcode the date the configapplicationdata was publishededitedp  pThe application sends a request to codeconfigcode and the NodeJS server displays the latest codeconfigdatacode row as well as the latest codeapplicationdatacode UUID.

Negative 17 pI did a PCA on my 3D image datasets, and used the first n PCs as my features in a linear SVM. I have SVM weights for each PC. Now, I want to project the PC weights into original image space to find what  regions of the image were more discriminative in the classification process. I used the inversetransform PCA method on the weight vector. However, the resulting image only has positive values, whereas the SVM weights were both positive and negative. This makes me think if my approach is a valid one. Does anybody have any suggestionsp  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 17 pI have two different data sets using two different SQL queries. Essentially one data set is daycaller stats rolled up the other set is call data. So each call data set rolls up to get their daycaller data.p  pI needed to separate these two queries for performance because I needed one extract and one parameterized custom query for the call data. So essentially I will always bring in this month of data and last month for the daycaller data.p  pWhat I need to do is create one dashboard, that has the caller and all of their stats aggregated for the time period. Then I need to be able to click a row to prompt all the call data in a different sheet on the same dashboardp  pI am at the home stretch and need a way to connect these two sheets and update the call data. Right now I only have a parameter for the Unique ID of the callers not time, I bring in all the same days of calls even though it is really not needed. In a perfect world I will click the report caller and my second query will update to the appropriate day range and Unique ID and produce only that callers calls. My problem right now is no matter what I do I cannot create the one sheet to update the second call sheet. I have successfully created a manually functioning report but I need the action to filter to a timer period and the specific caller.p  pLet me know if you have any feedback. My two issues are creating two separate queries  caller data 225k rows help in export call data 7 million rows if unfiltered which needs to be a live connection so when sheet is clicked the parameters will update and those calls will populate.

Do you guys have any suggestions Right now Im filtering them by checking to see if the url contains the url of the front page in it, which takes care of some but not all of the irrelevant URLs. It also filters out a lot of news articles based on what website Im scraping from.

Now I could probably use the view that is built into djangorestauth to update just the user portion, then create just a custom view that only updates the profile.

Negative 17 pI need to extract two blocks of text from several files and put them in separate lists using python. The first block starts from line 30, and isnt too hard to extract.

For examplep  precodeprjfiles  [   line,   line,   etc ]  prjfiles2  [   line,   etc ] codepre  pSo I need to take all the lines between [] in the first block and put it in one list, and take the lines between [] in the second block and put it in another list. As of right now, I usep  precodefor i, line in enumerateprj   if i gt 29  codepre  pto start on a specific line, and then it uses a regular expression to find ] where it breaks the for loop and records the line it ends on in cnt. Then I use another for loop to start at cnt  2 to extract the second block. While I think this works, I feel like its super inefficient since Im basically doing the same thing twice. Is there an obvious better method that Im missingp  pEDIT So instead of parsing the file, I tried to use codeimportcode instead. I do think its much simpler, but since Im looping through some files to find all the files, I have a general variable that represents the file name. This means when I try to use the variable to import the file, I get the module doesnt exist error. So for example, my variable name is codepyfilecode, and codeimportcode is reading it as codepyfilecode instead of the actual path value. Is there a way to get around thisp

I know its a specificity problem but just cant seem to get anything to work well. The only thing I can change fairly easily is p tags but I want to be able to change all text in a section easily.p  pIf I take out the foundation css stylesheet so that the page is just using standard html code with no css set from the outside then if I say added a class to a section say emclassblack bad I know  em and then placed a css style tag in the page with that style declared I would then be able to set both the background colour and also the text colour of that one section in one fell swoop.

Negative 17 pI am currently trying to make a version of Pong using pygame, but I am having some issues with detecting the collision between the ball and the paddle.  I got the detection working with both paddles, but I soon came to realize that the left player cannot move their paddle when the ball collides with it without the ball passing through.  The player on the right has no such issue, and keeping the left player still allows the ball to reflect normally.  p  precodeimport pygame, sys from pygame.locals import   pygame.init pygame.mixer.init pygame.font.init  BLACK  0, 0, 0 WHITE  255, 255, 255  screenx  1080 screeny  720  clock  pygame.time.Clock for pygame.mouse.getpos in screenx, screeny     pygame.mouse.setvisibleFalse    Blueprint for creating player character class Player      Defines initial conditions for player     def initself         self.xpos  0         self.ypos  0         self.width  20         self.length  100         self.speed  10         self.move  0         self.upkey  0         self.downkey  0         self.score  0         self.rect  pygame.Rectself.xpos, self.ypos, self.width, self.length       if player character, defines paddle movement     def playermoveself, key         if key[self.upkey]             self.ypos  self.speed             self.move  1         elif key[self.downkey]             self.ypos  self.speed             self.move  1         else             self.move  0       Creates screen boundary for players     def playerboundaryself, key         if self.ypos  0             self.speed  0             self.move  0             if key[self.downkey]                 self.speed  10                 self.move  1         elif self.ypos  self.length  screeny             self.speed  0             self.move  0             if key[self.upkey]                 self.speed  10                 self.move  1       Draws player rectangle to surface     def drawself, surface         self.rect  pygame.draw.rectsurface, WHITE, self.xpos, self.ypos, self.width, self.length    Blueprint for creating the ball class Ball     def initself         self.size  15         self.speed  10         self.vy  0         self.vx  10         self.ypos  screeny2         self.xpos  100         self.rect  pygame.Rectself.xpos, self.ypos, self.size, self.size       Defines movement of ball in xy components     def ballmoveself         self.ypos  self.vy         self.xpos  self.vx       method for ball bouncing off of player paddle      def ballblockself, player         if player.move gt 0             self.vy  player.speed  0.3             self.vx  self.speed2  self.vy2  .5         elif player.move lt 0             self.vy  player.speed  0.3             self.vx  self.speed2  self.vy2  .5         elif player.move  0             self.vx  self.vx       for reflecting off of screen boundaries      def ballreflectself, screeny         if self.ypos  0             self.vy  self.vy         elif self.ypos  screeny  self.size             self.vy  self.vy       Method for detecting when player has scored     def scoreself         if self.xpos  0             self.vx  self.vx             print Score         elif self.xpos  screenx  self.size             self.vx  self.vx             print Score       Draws ball to surface     def drawself, surface         self.rect  pygame.draw.rectsurface, WHITE, self.xpos, self.ypos,     self.size, self.size  def setup      Assigns values to player 1 left side     player1  Player     player1.xpos  50     player1.ypos  screeny1.5     player1.upkey  Kw     player1.downkey  Ks       Assigns values to player 2 right side     player2  Player     player2.xpos  screenx  player2.width  50     player2.ypos  screeny1.5     player2.upkey  KUP     player2.downkey  KDOWN      return player1, player2   Main loop of the game def main     player1, player2  setup     ball  Ball     play  True      while play         for event in pygame.event.get             if event.type  QUIT                 pygame.quit                 sys.exit          key  pygame.key.getpressed         if key[KESCAPE]             play  False          if ball.rect.colliderectplayer1   For some reason, ball can go through P1 while moving             ball.ballblockplayer1         elif ball.rect.colliderectplayer2             ball.ballblockplayer2           Had issue with ball going through bottom, fixed by adding screeny to dependencies         if ball.ypos  0             ball.ballreflectscreeny         elif ball.ypos  screeny  ball.size             ball.ballreflectscreeny          player1.playermovekey         player2.playermovekey         ball.ballmove           Calls methods for player boundaries and ball scoring         player1.playerboundarykey         player2.playerboundarykey         ball.score   Ball will only score if colliding head on and not on P2s side           Draws objects to screen         surface.fillBLACK         player1.drawsurface         player2.drawsurface         ball.drawsurface          pygame.display.update         clock.tick60   Sets up screen, calls main loop surface  pygame.display.setmodescreenx, screeny pygame.display.setcaptionPONG  main codepre  pAs far as I can tell, the code for both players is identical, and yet only one player works in the way I intended it to.

Negative 17 pWe are extending the context object to have a sync functionality with another system.  We are currently doing this in savechanges.  However we realized there is a case when the context will be used in a transaction state using begintransaction with multiple calls to savechanges.  We dont want to sync the data till the full process is done.  We thought of doing it in dispose of the context.  p  pThe one issue we have is knowing if the transaction succeed.  If it succeeded then great sync away.  If it was rolled back then we of course dont want to sync.  How do we know the state of the transaction when a context is being disposed p

Negative 17 pWe actually have a 10Gbs servers and 1Gbs servers that coexist together temporary migrating solution [UDP traffic]. We would like to shape the traffic coming from the 10Gbs servers in order to avoid big bursts that the 1G servers could not handle.p  pIt seems that tc cannot do the job with a tbf or maybe we use it the wrong way. For instance on our 10G servers we tried the followingp  psudo tc qdisc add dev eth5 root tbf rate 950mbit latency 1s burst 50mbit peakrate 1000mbit mtu 1500p  pHere we normally set the peakrate at 1mb which normally cant generate burst  1mbs. Unfortunately, that does not work, in fact after using this tc config, we lower our main bandwidth to at max 2Mbs.. p  pOur only clue for this strange behavior is that sentence in the tc manualp  pTo achieve perfection, the second bucket may contain only a single packet, which leads to the earlier mentioned 1mbits limit. p  pThis limit is caused by the fact that the kernel can only throttle for at minimum 1 jiffy, which depends on HZ as 1HZ. For perfect shaping, only a single packet can get sent per jiffy  for HZ100, this means 100 packets of on average 1000 bytes each, which roughly corresponds to 1mbits. p  pSo, its sure we cant have a peakrate  1Mbits p  pMaybe, there is another completely different way to achieve our goal, if anyone has a suggestion that would help me achieve our goal..  p  pKind regardsp

Negative 17 pIve spent the last few days reading up on hybrid app development and all the options available out there. Ive eventually decided to go with a hrefhttpwww.ionicframework.com relnofollowIonica. Thing thing is though, that at my current company we work on Windows machines so we cant build for iOS ourselves, also we dont want to go through all the trouble of installing the Android and Windows Phone SDKs just so that we can do builds and run emulators. Wed rather do our testing and development running the app inbrowser using codeionic servecode. But then it comes to building the app, I see that PhoneGap has something called a hrefhttpsbuild.phonegap.com relnofollowPhoneGap Builda.

Negative 17 pIm writing a small autoupdater that runs before my program starts. When it decides that it needs to update the main program, it downloads the file.exe and checks the md5sum.

Negative 17 pIn considering a database design for a community driven commentingreply system that will allow users to have detailed profiles as well as the ability to have uploaded photos and imagesp  pShould the most common queried information be placed in an independent table for performance purposes Specifically, the users screen name and their avatar.p  pFrom an organizational standpoint, I am inclined to store the users avatar profile picture in a table along with all other images named userimages. The screen name would be stored in a table named userdetails. p  pBut, after performance considerations, I am leaning towards placing the screen name and avatar in an independent table for faster queries. This is because the vast majority of queries derived from page views will only require the screen name and avatar of a user.

But when the scan runs as part of the schedule define inside the codeGlobal.asaxcode I did not notice any performance draw backs during the schedule task execution. p  pnow from my own understanding is that when I called the action method from my web browser the scanning service will reach the IIS and the application server and it might occupied most of the threats so this will cause performance slowness,, while when the action method is being calls from the Global.asax file then the iis and the application server will not get affected. Can this be the reason why I got performance differences p

Negative 17 pIm trying to build a route for the POST method and test that it works with the Rest Client made available in Webstorm 10.0. Ive read the API and many stackOverflow questions on hapijs and rest client regarding this. Ive gotten the route for the GET method built and successfully tested. Im struggling with post though, in particular, reading in the payload and submitting requests through the rest client. Basically, Im trying to send in a car object that has the form codebrandbrandNamecode in the mongodb database for example codeid ObjectIdaisjdioajsoidj, brand Kiacode shows up in mongodb shell.p  pThis is what Ive gotten so far for the routep  precodeserver.route method POST,  path typebrand, only designed to post cars types currently handler functionrequest,reply      var postPayload  request.payload even after I submit text through the rest client postPayload never takes on request.payloads value.

I added codeContentType applicationjsoncode to the request headers. To submit a post request I entered codebrandToyota2.3code into the text field under the request body section. Ive also tried codecarbrandToyota2.3code both show up in the debugger like codebrandToyota2.3code. However when I put request.payload into the validator I get the error code validation  type object  code. I seem to have no way to convert this information to an object. Also note, I set the method to POST in the debugger, filled in the hostport with codehttplocalhost8000code and I filled in the path with codecarKiacode which all worked for when I added the GET route. My thoughts, is there anyway to convert coderequest.payloadcode to an object or am I using the rest client incorrectly perhaps I am missing  I would appreciate advice, thanksp

Negative 17 pIs there any kind of test framework for Erlang which is similar to a hrefhttpdoc.akka.iodocsakkasnapshotscalatesting.htmlAsynchronousIntegrationTestingwithTestKit relnofollowTestKita in Akka p  pThe goal is to test processes in an integrated environment, for example, to send some messages to a group of processes on one end and assert the resulting messages coming out on the other end. The Akka Testkit makes these kinds of tests fairly straightforward, but I have not been able to find the equivalent in Erlang yet.p  pEDIT as the simplest example of what Im looking for, lets say that we have a process A that is expected to send a message to process B, and I would like to test this behaviour. p  pIn Akka, I can instantiate an actor based on the TestKit class, which has a builtin method codeexpectMsgcode. So my test looks like thisp  ul liinstantiate a mock B actorli liinstantiate the A actor which gets a reference to B somehowli lisend A a messageli licall B.expectMsg to verify that it received the message note that   ul lithis automatically makes sure that no other type of message is sent to B, andli liyou can optionally provide a timeoutli ulli ul  pIs there a library that supports this kind of workflow in Erlang As far as I know neither EUnit nor CT support this kind of testing.p  pTo get an idea of the more complex assertions, please see this page a hrefhttpdoc.akka.ioapiakka2.0akkatestkitTestKit.html relnofollowhttpdoc.akka.ioapiakka2.0akkatestkitTestKit.htmlap

Negative 17 pI have a script that someone wrote for me that saves an image with text to a database and is then called to another page to create a gallery. Since the code was written, the person who wrote it has disappeared and Im left without someone to alter it  so I turn to you guys in hopes that someone may be able to help me since its a bit over my head.p  pThis inserts the data into the DB       precodeconnect to the database include database connection include mysqlconnect.php    if FILES[image][error] gt 0        Bad Output for form results red text      echo ltfont size  5gtltfont colore31919gtError NO CHOSEN FILE ltbr gt      echoltpgtltfont size  5gtltfont colore31919gtINSERT TO DATABASE FAILED        else          moveuploadedfileFILES[image][tmpname],images .

Unfortunately using CSS doesnt help me in this situation. Any guidance is helpful  thanks.p
