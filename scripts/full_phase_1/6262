Positive 6262 pIt is not the first time this question has been asked, but no solution has been found yet. The only thread I found somewhat relevant was this but it is 4 years old a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4068144ssrsreportsversioningSSRS Reports Versioningap  pPerhaps a solution has been found since thenp  pBack to my questions I have several reports in a Visual Studio solution BIDS. From here I can deploy to several reporting servers Test1, Test2 and Production.p  p1 It seems that the granularity of deployment is Reports, Datasets and Datasources. This can be setup in Properties for the solution. But I want to be able to only deploy a single report, if I only have changes to one report. How do I do this As it is now it seems that I have to deploy ALL reports.p  p2 Since I have more than 1 place to deploy there is a possibility of the reports getting out of sync. Normally the procedure would be to deploy the reports to Test until everything is fine, and thereafter deploy to Production. But since this is a manual process something can go wrong. Therefore I believe it would be nice to have some sort of versioning on the individual reports. But I can find no way of doing this Im thinking that it would be really nice if a timestamp andor versionnumber could be set on the reports when they are deployed. Is there a way to do thisp  pThanks in advance.p

Positive 6262 pI am working on rdlc reports in asp.net. What my company wants me to do is to leave an empty page only after the first page since they are printing it twoside. The content is in tablix group and I somehow need to add an empty page only after the first page first group item there are lots of group items coming from SQL. Any help would be really appreciated.p
Positive 6262 pI have a bunch of reports with margin formulas. The page margins depend on the current page number and the current page orientation. The formulas are the same in every report. I want to set those formulas by code so I wont have to change every margin in every report manually when the corporate design changes.p  pWhat I already found was the BeforeFormatPageEvent. The EventArgs contain only the current page number. What I need is the current page orientation for setting the margins correctly. And this is where Im stuck at the moment. Is this possible at all and if yes, how can I do thisp

Positive 6262 pI have a report in ssrs that uses Barcode font 3 of 9. It will export to pdf until I try to do that from the web. I have looked all over the web for solutions and found that I needed to restart my server that the report is stored on. This fixed the issue and the barcode was visible when you made a pdf from it. It worked for about three days, but now the issue has returned. I have checked to make sure that the font is still installed on the server and that the barcode is embedded properly. Both are still good to go. I would like to know if there is a more permanent fix, or if I am going to have to restart the server frequently. Thanks for the helpp

Negative 6262 pI have a question that Im struggling with in ADO.NET Data Servicesp  pWhen assembling an Entity for storage I need to get a related value from a lookup file.  For example a person has a status code assigned of Pending which is in a table called StatusCodes.p  pIn Entity Framework, Id need to set the value of person.StatusCode equal to an instance of the StatusCode.  In the Entity Framework or in LINQ2Sql Id so something like thisp  precode      var person  Person.CreatePersonstuff    var statCode  myContext.StatusCodeSet.Wheresc gt sc.Description  Pending.FirstOrDefault    person.StatusCode  statCode     ...more code here...    myContext.BeginSaveChangesSaveChangesOptions.Batch,                                  new AsyncCallbackOnSaveAllComplete,                                  null codepre  pThe query for the statCode wont work in ADO.NET Data Services and I get a runtime error saying the function is not supported.

Negative 6262 pAs part of a project Im working on in C I need to read in a .dbf file. The first thing I want to do is to get the schema table from the file. I have code that works as long as the filename without the extension is not longer than 8 characters.p  pFor example, lets say I have a file named MyLongFilename.dbf. The following code does not work it throws the following exception The Microsoft Jet database engine could not find the object MyLongFilename.  Make sure the object exists and that you spell its name and the path name correctly.p  precodestring cxn  PROVIDERMicrosoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0Data SourceCMyLongFilenameExtended PropertiesdBASE 5.0 OleDbConnection connection  new OleDbConnectioncxn codepre  pTo get past this exception, the next step is to use a name the OldDbConnection likes MyLongF1 instead of MyLongFilename, which leads to thisp  precodestring cxn  PROVIDERMicrosoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0Data SourceCMyLongF1Extended PropertiesdBASE 5.0 OleDbConnection connection  new OleDbConnectioncxn codepre  pThis does successfully return an OleDbConnection. Now to get the schema table I try the followingp  precodeconnection.Open DataTable schemaTable  connection.GetOleDbSchemaTableOleDbSchemaGuid.Columns,     new object[]  null, null, fileNameNoExt, null  codepre  pThis returns a DataTable with no rows. If I rename the filename to 8 or less characters then this code works and I get back a row for each field in the database.p  pWith the long filename, I know the returned connection is valid because I can use it to fill a DataSet like so p  precodestring selectQuery  SELECT  FROM [MyLongF1DBF] OleDbCommand command  new OleDbCommandselectQuery, connection connection.Open OleDbDataAdapter dataAdapter  new OleDbDataAdapter dataAdapter.SelectCommand  command DataSet dataSet  new DataSet dataAdapter.FilldataSet codepre  pThis gives me back a DataSet containing a DataTable with all of the data from the dbf file.p  pSo the question is how can I get just the schema table for the long named dbf file  Of course I can work around the issue by renamingcopying the file, but thats a hack I dont want to have to make. Nor do I want to fill the DataSet with the top 1 record and deduce the schema from columns.p

Negative 6262 pI am writing algorithms that work on series of numeric data, where sometimes, a value in the series needs to be null.  However, because this application is performance critical, I have avoided the use of nullable types.  I have perf tested the algorithms to specifically compare the performance of using nullable types vs nonnullable types, and in the best case scenario nullable types are 2x slower, but often far worse. p  pThe data type most often used is double, and currently the chosen alternative to null is double.NaN.  However I understand this is not the exact intended usage for the NaN value, so am unsure whether there are any issues with this I cannot foresee and what the best practise would be.p  pI am interested in finding out what the best null alternatives are for the following data types in particular  doublefloat, decimal, DateTime, intlong although others are more than welcomep  pEdit I think I need to clarify my requirements about performance. Gigs of numerical data are processed through these algorithms at a time which takes several hours.  Therefore, although the difference between eg 10ms or 20ms is usually insignificant, in this scenario it really does makes a significant impact to the time taken.p

Negative 6262 pIve inherited a significantly sized internal app at the company I work for.  It has two parts.  One runs on a LAMP server, the other runs on a WAMP server.  There is no source control to be seen.p  pCurrently, developers will log into each server via FTP and just directly edit the PHP files that are there.  Or log into phpMyAdmin and make changes to DB schema where necessary.p  pWhat is the best way to implement some source control into this situation  Im not very knowledgeable on how to best setup CVS ans SVN.

Negative 6262 pIm an asp.net newbie. I have inherited a base of asp.net mvc code and in order to help myself orient better in the heaping pile of source in front of me Id like to step through it in a debugger. However, being the microsoft platform newbie I am, I dont know how to go about this.p  pOur application serves content under many different hostnames, which I have set up in my hosts file, so that I can access the app under uris like customername.mysite.loc. Because of this I think using the builtin web server in Visual Studio 2008 is not an option in my case and that I should attach my VS debugger directly to the IIS process under which the application happens to be running.p  pUnfortunately I havent found a whole lot of information on Google on how to do this. Most of the tutorials found there either contradict each other or use various older versions of IIS Im running 7.0 under Windows Server 2008. Apparently the solution involves compiling my sources in debug mode which I have done, setting the application in IIS into debug mode and attaching to the process somehow, but so far Ive had no success with this simple outline.p  pCan anyone please point me to a working guide or describe a better way to debug my project Is what I want to do even possible Thanks a lotp
Negative 6262 pI have a number of different objects with a varying number of attributes. Until now I have saved the data in XML files which easily allow for an ever changing number of attributes. But I am trying to move it to a database.p  pWhat would be your preferred way to store this datap  pA few strategies I have identified so farp  ul liHaving one single field named attributes in the objects table and store the data serialized or jsoned in there.li liStoring the data in two tables objects, attributes and using a third to save the relations, making it a true nm relation. Very clean solution, but possibly very expensive to fetch an entire object and all its attributesli liIdentifying attributes all objects have in common and creating fields for these to the objects table. Store the remaining attributes as serialized data in another field. This has an advantage over the first strategy, making searches easier.li ul  pAny ideasp

Negative 6262 pGiven a fairly complex object with lots of state, is there a pattern for exposing different functionality depending on that statep  pFor a concrete example, imagine a codePrintercode object.p  ul lipInitially, the objects interface lets you query the printers capabilities, change settings like paper orientation, and start a print job.pli lipOnce you start a print job, you can still query, but you cant start another job or change certain printer settings.  You can start a page.pli lipOnce you start a page, you can issue actual text and graphics commands.  You can finish the page.  You cannot have two pages open at once.pli lipSome printer settings can be changed only between pages.pli ul  pOne idea is to have one codePrintercode object with a large number of methods.  If you call a method at an inappropriate time e.g., try to change the paper orientation in the middle of a page, the call would fail.  Perhaps, if you skipped ahead in the sequence and start issuing graphics calls, the codePrintercode object could implicitly call the codeStartJobcode and codeStartPagecode methods as needed.  The main drawback with this approach is that it isnt very easy for the caller.  The interface could be overwhelming, and sequence requirements arent very obvious.p  pAnother idea is to break things up into separate objects  codePrintercode, codePrintJobcode, and codePagecode.  The codePrintercode object exposes the query methods and a codeStartJobcode method.  codeStartJobcode returns a codePrintJobcode object that has codeAbortcode, codeStartPagecode, and methods for changing just the changeable settings.  codeStartPagecode returns a codePagecode object that offers an interface for making the actual graphics calls.  The drawback here is one of mechanics.  How do you expose the interface of an object without surrendering control of that objects lifetime  If I give the caller a pointer to a codePagecode, I dont want them to codedeletecode it, and I cant give them another one until they return the first.p  pDont get too hung up on the printing example.  Im looking for the general question of how to present different interfaces based on the objects state.p
Negative 6262 pI have a Java Spring project, configured with Maven. As the amount of unit tests and their configuration files is adding up rapidly, Im trying to centralize the test configurations to one properties file the same one, which is used in building the project.p  pThe unit tests are located relative to the project path, of course in tree presrctestjavacom ...prep  pThe resource files for those tests are in presrctestresources...prep  pAnd lastly, the properties file, which the resource file should read, is in directory presrcmainfiltersprep  pNow, I have a Junit class where I specify the configuration file location like thisp  precode ContextConfigurationlocations   classpathcominitrodequartzSyncManagerJobTestcontext.xml codepre  pIn the configuration file SyncManagerJobTestcontext.xml there is a linep  precode ltcontextpropertyplaceholder locationsrcmainfiltersdeploy.local.properties codepre  pThis results in the properties file to be read from directory . What Id like to read is the properties file, which is located under srcmainfilters. I tried using .... to traverse the directory upwards, but that didnt help. Using classpath didnt work out either. I could use an absolute path with file, but that would require every developer in the project to modify the configuration, which is not good either.p  pTo summarize, the question is how can I force the configuration file in srctestresources to read the properties file in srcmainfiltersp  pAnd a related bonus question when handling files in Java environment, are there other modifiers than file and classpathp
Negative 6262 pI have an App.config file in my project that gets copied to NameOfExe.exe.config at build time. The users of my software will need to edit this file at times, but they may not be familiar with how .NET does things or how computers do things in general. I think using a file name like that might confuse them, with the .exe.config extension and such.p  pHow can I specify a new name for this copied file remove the .exe bit Should I use a custom build command Also, will .NET pick up on the config file, or does it require that naming schemep  pEDIT In response to suggestions to reconsider... the application acts as either a service or a console app, so theres no GUI to edit settings. The configuration file contains settings used to connect to a database and an API service. These values should not need to be changed after the initial setup for each customer which is done by me. In the unlikely event that the values do need to be changed, the customer will need to call me to get the new connection details anyway, so I can walk them through what to edit and how. I would simply like to avoid any confusion when I tell a customer that they need to open a file called .exe.config, at which point they launch the .exe file by mistake. Also, if they need to launch the .exe file and have Hide extensions of known file types enabled, some may try to open the config file and then call me wanting to know why they instead get a Notepad window full of strange text.p  pSure, its not required, but I like to plan ahead.p

Negative 6262 pTo be on the same page, lets assume sizeofint4 and sizeoflong8.p  pGiven an array of integers, what would be an efficient method to logically bitshift the array to either the left or rightp  pI am contemplating an auxiliary variable such as a long, that will compute the bitshift for the first pair of elements index 0 and 1 and set the first element 0. Continuing in this fashion the bitshift for elements index 1 and 2 will be computer, and then index 1 will be set.p  pI think this is actually a fairly efficient method, but there are drawbacks. I cannot bitshift greater than 32 bits. I think using multiple auxiliary variables would work, but Im envisioning recursion somewhere along the line.p

Within the code of the application I would instantiate the implementation classes dynamically.p  pIs this approach possible in Flex Im aware that I can instantiate classes dynamically so thats a good start. Im a bit confused by modules, RSLs and SWCs though.p  pI was hoping to create a SWF application that had references to an interfaces SWC and an implementation SWC. The idea is that if I need to tweak the application for a specific customer then I could create a new implementation SWC and not have to modify the SWF or interface SWC.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 6262 pHey, Im thinking about it, which of the following two query types would give me the fastest performance for a user messaging module inside my sitep  pThe first one i thought about is a multi table setup, which has a connection table, and a main table. The connection table holds the connection between accounts, and the messaging table.p  pIn this case a query would look like following, to get some data of the author, and the messages he has sentp  precodeSELECT m., a.username    FROM messages AS m   LEFT JOIN connectiontable      ON messageid  m.id   LEFT JOIN accounts AS a      ON accountid  a.id  WHERE m.id  32341 codepre  pInserting into it is a little bit more complicated.p  pMy other idea, and in my thought the better solution of this problem is that i store the data i would use in a connection table in the same table where is store the data of the mail. Sounds like i would get lots of duplicated entries, but no, because i have a field which has text type and holds user ids like this 2432249 If I want to query them, i use the mysql LIKE method. Deleting is an other problem, but for this i have one more field where i store who has deleted the post. Sad about that i dont know how to join this.p  pSo what would you recommend Are there other waysp

What I want to do instead though is perform all graphic functions done on the bitmap using the power of the video card.

I, instead, want to use the graphics card cpu and memory to do these and other advanced functions, such as skinning a bitmap applying a texture and true transparancy. My problem is, in C, how do I access direct video functions Is there a library or something I needp

Is there anyway to perform a LINQ query on these, or convert a the array of DataRows to a DataTable, so I can chain the results of the filter into the linq queryp
Negative 6262 pIm developing a screen shot utility in Python. At the moment it is specifically for Linux. So far I have the ability to take a screen shot of the full desktop, and have it upload to Imgur, then copy the link to clipboard. Now I want to expand into functions such as screen shots of the active window, or of a specific selection. If anyone could help, Id love to know what kind of module would work best for this, and how to implement such a module.p

Negative 6262 pI am currently coding a very large project, I am near the end of the development stage and have sent out an evaluation version to the consumer so he can check for bugs and what not. He told me that there was a large log file being created every time the application starts up. After some investigation I found out that the log file was created using log4net via an external DLL which I use in my application.  I have searched a bit and found you can disable log4net logs through an app.config file and adding several values there, I tried this but with no success, the logs are being created no matter which value I use in the xml config file.p  pI have no access to the external DLL source code and I have searched for an xml configuration file that the DLL uses  but have not found anything.p  pI would like to disable log4net completely, the Logs are pretty useless for me since I use my own log engine, which i can configure any way I want it.p  pThanks for any helpp

Negative 6262 pJust got a new Windows laptop, installing emacs23 on it.p  pMy previous computers have used emacs 22 for Idontknowhowlong.  p  pI have a longish emacs.el, which loads various side elisp libraries.  I had everything set up just so, in emacs 22.  p  pI brought this emacs.el over to the new pc, along with all the other elisp modules.  Started emacs, and everything looks good.   Theres just one weird issue. p  pNear the top of the emacs.el, I do p  precode  basic, default colors  setfaceforeground default white setfacebackground default black codepre  pThis makes the background black, and the foreground white whiteonblack. This is the opposite of what a default install of emacs on Windows will do.  p  pWhile the rest of emacs.el is loading, I can see that these colors are in effect.  Its just a blank Window, not even the scratch buffer is displayed.  All I See is the message at the bottom of the window updating me on the progress of the load.  For some reason loading is much slower  I think I have some uncompiled .el libraries  Ill have to investigate that separately. Even so, it is a black window. Without those statements in emacs.el, the window remains white. Anyway, everything loads, then the screen reverts to blackonwhite, rather than whiteonblack.p  pThe weird part is all the other fonts Ive set, seem to stick.  Fonts like comment fonts, string fonts, functionnames and so on in ccmode... these all remain.  Only the default foreground and background fonts dont stick. p  pI guessed that maybe something in the stack of elisp modules was maybe resetting these fonts. So I duplicated those two statements from above at the very end of the emacs.el file. Still, though, the fonts get reverted. p  pIf I then eval those statements in the scratch buffer after everything has loaded, then the fonts look as I expect  whiteonblack. p  pIs there something different about how emacs23 does default fontsbr Why does it revertbr Why can I not get these settings to stick when evaluated from emacs.el  p  pThanks for any help yall can offer.p

This part is fine.p  pIt becomes weird when i set allowsEditing to YES. the didiFinishPickingMediaWithInfo delegate returns an NSDictionary info with BOTH the editedImage and originalImage in it, even when user did NOT crop the image shown in the picker. So the problem is how can i detect whether the user cropped the image or notp  pWhat I need for my app is the user is allowed to crop the image if he wishes to, but he also is given the choice NOT to crop, thus returning the original photo. Currently I am using a segmentedcontrol for user to preselect before loading a photo, which I think is pretty inconvenience. And maybe some user does not understand it.p  pSo how can I implement what I need without troubling the user so much p

I am trying to create an instance affinity to stop hot block from slowing down the database as these need be sent across the interconnect between the RAC nodes. We have empirically proved that this does make a difference in our testing.p

Negative 6262 pmy asp.net application uses some sequences to generate tables primary keys. Db administrators have set the cache size to 20. Now the application is under test and a few records are added daily say 4 for each user test session.  Ive found that new test session records always use new cache portions as if the preavious day cached numbers had expired, losing tenth of keys everyday. Id like to understand if its due to some mistake i might have made in my application disposing of tableadapters or whatever or if its the usual behaviour. There are programming best practices to take into account when handling oracle sequences p  pSince the application will not have to bear an heavy load of work say 2040 new records at day, i was tinking if it might be the case to set a smaller cache size or none at all. Does sequence cache resizing implies the reset of current index p  pthank you in advance for any hint   p

Negative 6262 pIm a Rails and REST newbie and Im trying to figure how best to expose a resource that is backed by a domain object that has a state machine in other words is a finite automata. p  pIve seen a number of gems for making a model class a state machine, such as aasm, transitions, workflow, but none of them document examples of how they are actually used in a resource oriented controller. They all seem to imply that state transitions are triggered by an event , which is really a method call. Some questions I have with what this implies arep  ol liThe update action PUT method is not appropriate because PUT is suppose to be idempotent. The only this would be possible is if the state was sent as part of the representation. This is inconsistet with an event. Is this correctli liSince, events arent idempotent, then the a POST must be used. But, to which resource Is there a subresource for each possible event Or, is there one updatestate that takes as its representation the event to trigger and any parameters to the eventli liSince the state of the resource is modified by an event triggered potentially by another resource, should the create action accept changes to the state attribute or any other attributes that are dependent on the state machineli li[Updated question] What is a good way to expose the transitions in the UI Since events arent states, it would seem that it doesnt make sense to allow the state attribute and any other attribute that is dependent on state transitions to be updated. Does that mean that these attributes should be ignored in the update actionli ol

Negative 6262 pI was reading the through the list of a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarycc83824728VS.9629.aspxdifferencesa between the Silverlight implementation for Windows and the implementation for the MAC. Which can be found a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarycc83824728VS.9629.aspxHEREa.p  pWhile some of the differences are obviously related to the platform diffirences etc. There are some that I just wonder why they would be different at all. If anyone has some thoughts or actual concrete information on this, I would be interested to hear your input.p  pHere are a few of the things that seemed strange, especially the last point in my list, which is what actually prompted me to post this question.p  ol listrongChar.ToLowerChar, CultureInfostrong  On the MAC the current culture is used rather than the specified culture. Strange since the MAC presumably does support multiple cultures I dont own a MAC or know much about it so this is an assumption on my partli listrongDecimalSingleUInt16UInt32UInt64strong  The document states that the mentioned types are not supported, is it that the OS does not support them so they are emulated I use the term emulated loosely since the underlying CPU definitely supports them excluding Decimal of course.li listrongDoubleSingle Infinity propertiesstrong  Why have these return different strings on the different platforms. Now I am not saying people should use the string representation for comparisons, that would be silly, but why make them different, isnt that just looking for portability problems where they do not need to exist Or is this more a platform specific user experience issue, MAC users expect to see the infinity symbol rather than the wordsli listrongCultureInfo Constructorstrong  On Windows if an invalid culture string is passed to the constructor an ArgumentException is thrown, on the MAC the CultureInfo is initialized as the current culture and no exception is raised.li ol  pNow none of these are serious differences given that your code is written according to commonly understood best practices. However, I wonder why a thing I consider, possibly incorrectly, to be part of a behavior contract, though not explicit in .NET, like what I can expect when passing an invalid culture string to a constructor, does not deliver a consistent behavior across platforms, that seems rather arbitrary and again just looking for portability problems where there there is no good reason, or is therep

And most recent date record is considered active record in each table.p  pIs there a fast and better way to join them and return most recent records from each table Right now i select max from each table and join on that to return recent record from different tables.p

Negative 6262 pI feel like this is a question thats likely to have been answered already, but Im having trouble finding it. Chalk it up to bad search terms, perhaps.p  pIve been working in Visual Studio 2005 Professional for about a month now, and thus far Ive been using the builtin compile mechanism with mostlydefault settings the only thing Ive changed with any real frequency is the build path. Id like, however, to move to using more automated build techniques. To that end, Id like to switch to using codecsccode calls instead of hitting codeCtrlShiftBcode or codeF5code, so that I can include the lines in build scripts and other tools like NAnt. p  pMy question is, does Visual Studio or any third party tool provide a way to programmatically convert the compile setting ins VS to its codecsccode equivalent For example, if I have a project called SampleProject with the codeOutput typecode field set to Windows Application, it would look something likep  precodecsc outputwinexe targetSampleProject.exe .cs codepre  pI know its usually not terribly difficult to work this out by hand, but if theres a way to automatically pull it together, its that much better.p

Since Im not a student anymore, I no longer have webspace with a tidy little codecgibincode subdirectory thats hooked up perfectly.p  pI wrote a simple CGI Python program a few years ago, and was trying to use this as a template. p  pHere is my quesion My program needs to create temporary files when run from the command line it saves images to a given path.  Ive read a couple tutorials on Apache, etc. and got lots of things running, but I cant figure out how to let my program write temporary files I also dont know where these files would live, etc.. Any time I try to write to a file in any manner in my Python program, the CGI crashes and doesnt seem OK.p  pI am not extremely worried about security because the temporary files will only be outputs of the program not the user input.p  pAnd while Im asking Im assuming youre kind of a CGI ninja if you got this far and werent bored, do you know my CGI program can take a file argument without making a temporary file p  pMy previous approach to this was to simply take a list of text as an argumentp  precodetry     if item.file         data  item.file.read         if check             Toolsfile.main[ExeName, d, w   data]         else             Toolsfile.main[ExeName, s, d, w   data] ... codepre  pId like to do this emthe right wayem Cheers in advance.p  pStack overflowingly yours,br Oliverp

Negative 6262 pThere is one thing, what I should make for client web page. All done, except plugin is not working properly. Anyways, there comes a little description.p  pFirst of all, Im using Wordpress, but probably this doesnt make any changes. Secondly, I have to make latest post list, which displays post title, and excerpt text of that post. But client wanted also that excerpt to marquee. And more  client wanted to show only first post excerpt marquee by default, others  on hover. I started of to look for suitable jquery plugin, and a hrefhttpwww.givainc.comlabsmarqueejqueryplugin.htm relnofollowthisa seemed best. Then I wrote php codep  pa hrefhttppastebin.comLWmaFvqz relnofollowhttppastebin.comLWmaFvqzap  pEverything works great. But problem is, that every ltligtlt theexcerptgtltligt is marqueeing around.p  pThen I added class marqueehide, and tried to remove it on hover like thisp  pa hrefhttppastebin.comZC4QtTbP relnofollowhttppastebin.comZC4QtTbPap  pThere is a problem, which, I hope, somebody will help to solve. And problem is that, when I hover that title, I get some content, but plugin is not working. But I tested, if I hover this while page is loading, that marquee plugin is working. So, I tought, there might be some kind of function, almost like document.ready, but just which starts working not, when page is loaded, but then, when hover is triggered.p  pI hope, I described my problem clear, so You could help me p  pPS  Done some changes in css, and got better result. This plugin asks to be visible on page load. This display none messed all evening. I just thought to use height 0 instead of display none, so this li is visible for jquery, but not for our eyes. And it quite much works.p

Negative 6262 pShortening identifier names makes the resulting executable smaller in size since MSIL code includes all these names except local variable ones. Does it affect executing the code in .NET runtime in a good way in terms of performance, at least in theory Native machine code doesnt include all those names but it interoperates with .NET runtime. So I wonder if it makes sense to obfuscate namely shorten identifier names the MSIL code in order to increase the runtime performance of the application at least a little.p  pI was surprised by this statement Dotfuscator improves runtime performance.

Negative 6262 pDoes anybody have any tipstricks as to how to improve performance in the following scenariop  ul liI have a record set of approx. 500,000 rows.li liTheres a lot of data being pulled for this query.  In order to minimize the query time, Ive broken this up into several smaller queries all stored in temp tables with indexes and such.  At the end I assemble all the smaller queries into one temp table to serve as the master record for the final query.li liCurrent execution time for the above step is approximately 2 minutes not too bad, considering the amount of data being pulledli liThe final result needs to be delivered in XML format.  When writing my final query, Im using codeFOR XML EXPLICITcode to put this into the proper format.li liThe problem Im running into is that the above XML query is taking 30 minutes, which is way too long in this case.li ul  pSo, I do have a couple options herep  ul liId be able to preload this data into an actual table, and then query off that instead of using temp tables.  Im not sure this will buy me much time, as the issue isnt with loading the data, but rather the long time that it takes to generate the XML.li liThe above XML will eventually be loaded into our C codebase to be uploaded to its final destination.  Does it make more sense to simply load the record set into C, and do the XML transformation there, instead of doing it on the database sideli liRight now Im using codeFOR XML EXPLICITcode are there any performance benefits gained by using any of the other XML modes codeRAWcode, codeAUTOcode, codePATHcodeli ul  pThanks again.p  pJimp

Negative 6262 pIll preface this by saying that Ive been developing in .NET for many years, and VBBASIC for many years before that, but my background is mostly in desktop applications and system interfaces  Im still pretty new to all this web application stuff, so I apologize up front if this is a silly question.p  pThat said, heres my question strongwhen you create an object in an ASPX page and store it in cache, how can you access it from an ASMX web service that resides in the same applicationstrongp  pTo further elaborate I have a single web application which includes ASPX pages, an ASMX web service, and a class library consisting of two object classes. When the user signs in to the application, they configure some settings, and the objects are created and stored in a system.Web.Caching.Cache object. The custom objects are then pulled out of cache on the next page, and the user then makes an AJAX call via jQuery to the web service to retrieve some data.p  pThe problem is that in the web service response, I need to parse the returned data based on the content of the usercreated objects stored in the web applications cache. However, I cant find any way to access the cached object from inside the web service.p  pI have a sneaking suspicion that it may be possible to serialize my custom .NET objects into JSON objects and pass them via the AJAX call to the web service for deserialization, but frankly, I would have no idea how to even begin at that. Plus the objects are potentially 30  40K in size, and the AJAX call is being made as frequently as once every 3 seconds, so Id really like to avoid the overhead of passing all that extra data with each call, especially since the data I need is already sitting in memory in the application where the web service resides.p  pSo once again, I ask when you create an object in an ASPX page and store it in cache, how can you access it from an ASMX web service that resides in the same applicationp  pIs this making sense Am I crazy Missing something obvious Any insight anyone can provide would be VERY highly appreciated. Thanksp

Negative 6262 pWell, here I am again with another frustrating question. I need to end my main process and restart it, but I cant just end the application gracefully...p  pI am using a C application in conjunction with proprietary not to me data capture hardware, so right there its already complicated.p  pThere is a scenario when my software is happily running, collecting its data as it should, when the hardware Im interfacing with suddenly loses power and the connection to my application. My application eventually figures this out and I just need to dispose of my old connection, and make a new one to connect to my hardware again. Wrong...p  pOf course, the .Dispose method on my object the interface object with the hardware, that terminates the connection does nothing, and actually just locks in place forever when I try to run it. Apparently there is some kind of communication that never times out on the dispose method that requires the device to be connected when the disconnection happens. I didnt write the method, so I dont really know.p  pFinally, heres my question. The only way to get my application up and running again is to close it and reopen it. Of course, I cant actually close it nicely because I cant run the Dispose method. I am forced to end its process via taskmanager. Yes, the process, not just the application. If I just close it, the process will stay alive forever, I have no choice.p  pI need to find a way to automate this process assassination so my users can actually use it, but what can I do I know process termination is taboo, but what options do I havep  pId love to use Application.Restart, but that doesnt work at all, my form doesnt even close, it just locks. Is there a way to axe the process just before telling itself to launch again Maybe I can do this with a batch file or something Application.Exit at least takes the form off the screen.p  pAs of now, Im killing it from Task Manager, or my users are killing it by popping the breaker on the PC. Considerably more harsh than anything softwarewise.p

Negative 6262 pI just got a requirement to create a small I assume standalone utility to hit some code in our web application to do some custom processing of files from the app and then dump the files into a shared drive. My question is what is the best way for doing this Do I just create a small app and then jar it up and run it off a command line or is there a better wayp  pSorry, I didnt give enough detail. Its an old application, like over 10 years, so while its been upgraded to jdk 1.6, most of the code uses the old collections, old loops, etc... There arent any interfaces, very tightly coupled code that uses inheritance with lots of nested objects. The web app will do the processing. I think what they want is create some code outside of the application code that will login and then fire off the file processing code. Prior to this I had upgraded their version of Windward Reports in a separate branch and they want to make sure that the processed files contracts, forms, etc.. dont get altered greatly as there are legal requirements on fonts and layouts. So this utility will go in, fire off the list of reports a few thousand dump it to a share drive so they can view them with another tool for comparision based on rules you can automate with that commercial tool, en masse. I was thinking create a small class with a main method, then jar it up and while the web server is running with my upgraded branch code, run the utility off the command line to fire it off. p

I also want to allow the user to click on several links, which should give urls like above with Subjectsemsubject1emsubject2emsubject3em.p  pI just cant figure out how to do this. Ive got the list of subjects showing in a partial view. When I generate the hyperlinks, how can I get to the url and modify or add or removed as required the Subjectsstrongstrong partp  pIt was easy with querystrings, because they could easily be broken into value paris, but with these beautiful urls it seems quite difficult... Any tipsp  pUPDATE I forgot to add that I would like to use this filtering method with different actions on the same controller. Not sure if that matters, but I thought Id be precise.p  pUPDATE 2 I think my question isnt quite clear enough...p  pWhat I am trying to do is generate a link for each subject in my partial view with respect to the link from the main view. The catch is that the link needs to conform to one of the routes above.p  pSay, I call this from localhostProjectsAll and want to sort by subject1, I would want to get urls saying localhostProjectsAllSubjectssubject1. If I called this from localhostProjectsSearchSomething10 i.e. page 10 of the results for search Something, I havent got this route in the list, but it is in the works, I would want urls like localhostProjectsSearchSomethingSubjectsSubject110. Or for that matter going from localhostProjectsAll4 to localhostProjectsAllSubjectssubject14.p  pI can easily append the SubjectsSubject1 bit to the URL, but then doesnt conform to my routes anymore... In other words, how can I extract the various bits from my url, modify them and then stitch them back togetherp  pIs this possible Or should I just forget prettyness and use querystringsp

Negative 6262 pI am trying to figure out the best way to get data onto my webpages for use in JavaScript.p  pThe majority of my experience is desktop land in .Net WPF etc. p  pTechnologyp  pI am currently using ASP.NET MVC3. I have a bunch of business layer models. These models can sometimes have interesting relationships. I need to get these models onto the client and do things in JavaScript with them and then send them back to the server for persistence and other business logic. p  pCore Valuesp  pI would like to find a solution that minimizes coupling, minimizes codefunctionality duplication, supports separation of concerns, and Easily maintainable IE understandable, knowing where to change what etc..p  pThere are a few ways of handling this that I have thought of. Both seem to fall short.p  pOption 1p  pCreate JavaScript versions of my models that I will call JavaScript View Models JSVMs. these JSVMs are created through Ajax calls. The JSVMs are mapped to from generated JavaScript objects based on the serverside models. That means there is a Map class somewhere that handles mapping to and from these two models to lower coupling and maintain SoC. p  pDownside, Lots of code duplication. When you change either the JSVM or the server side model, you might need to change this mapping class. p  pThis seems to solve only some of my issues.p  pOption 2p  pI found a library called FluentJson.Net. It basically allows me to create knockoutjs JavaScript objects from razor inline. From there I can basically just code against this dynamically create object. There is no need to create the JSVMs. p  pDownside, There is very tight coupling to the serverside model. A change in the serverside model could cause needed changes on multiple pages p  pThere are probably some combinations of option 1 and option 2 that I could explore but I assume they will all have drawbacks.p  pQuestionsp  pWhat I really would like to know is what are the best practices for handling models across the server and client Is there a solution that maintains my core valuesp  pEdit Added the following examplep  pExamplep  pC Modelsp  precodepublic interface IChartDefinition     string Nameget set     IEnumerableltIChartSeriesgt Series get set   public interface IChartSeries     Color Colorget set     Name get set  codepre  pOn the server this definition defines the basic chart. This chart definition is persisted to a database and can later be pulled up and used with real data to display a chart on the client.p  pI have a controller called ChartDesignerController and its basic function is to let people manage their chart definitions.p  pSo I have a view for called Create for creating a chart definition.  In my view I want a  button to add series. as series are added I want the UI to display options for the series such as color and name. The user can remove series etc.p  pAll of this interaction is done with javascript on underlying javascript objects that hold this data until the end user pushes the submit button and send this data back to the server to be persisted. p  pThese javascript objects will look almost identical to the C models that get persisted.p

Negative 6262 pI am trying to make a topographic map using different density points for density cells in a retina.

Negative 6262 pI wonder how to go about creating an expression in Java that takes a date variable formatted as 19991230 123445 and converts it to an Int holding 19991230.p  pThis is probably something others would appreciate, especially people extracting and cleaning up data for loading into a Data Warehouse.p  pMy guess is one need to change date pattern, convert to string, truncate first part 8 chars and convert to int.p  pIdeasp  pupdate My bad in explaining the issue. The resulting int will service as a keyFk id to a Date Dimension. A similar operation should be done for creating a key to a TimeofDay Dimension. The int will reduce the size consumed in the facts table, in which these int keys would be stored. See related answer a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma84165481132571httpstackoverflow.coma84165481132571ap

Negative 6262 pI am trying to reduce packets manipulation to its minimum in order to improve efficiency of a specific program i am working on but i am struggling with the time it takes to send through a udp socket using sendtorecvfrom. I am using 2 very basic processes applications, one is sending, the other one receiving.p  pI am willing to understand how linux internally works when using these function calls...p  pHere are my observations when sending packets atp  ul li10Kbps, the time it takes for the messages to go from one application to the other is about 28usli li400Kbps, the time it takes for the messages to go from one application to the other is about 25usli li4Mbps, the time it takes for the messages to go from one application to the other is about 20usli li40Mbps, the time it takes for the messages to go from one application to the other is about 18usli ul  pWhen using different CPUs, time is obviously different and consistent with those observations. There must be some sort of setting that enables some queue readings to be done faster depending on the traffic flow on a socket... how can that be controlledp  pWhen using a node as a forwarding node only, going in and out takes about 8us when using 400Kbps flow, i want to converge to this value as much as i can. 25us is not acceptable and deemed to slow it is obvious that this is way less than the delay between each packet anyway... but the point is to be able to eventually have a greater deal of packets to be processed, hence, this time needs to be shortened. Is there anything faster than sendtorecvfrom must use 2 different applications processes, i know i cannot use a monolitic block, thus i need info to be sent on a socketp

Negative 6262 pFirst some background. When firmware for whatever reason crashes e.g. stack overflow, corrupted function pointer... it may happen, that it jumps somewhere and starts executing some code. This will sooner or later result in watchdog reset. MCU will reset and we are back on track. Unless...p  pWhat about when we have code that writes to flash e.g. bootloader Now it can happen that we will accidentally jump directly into the flash write code  skipping all the checks. Before watchdog will bark you will end up with corrupted firmware. This is exactly what was happening to me.p  pNow some might say  fix the root bug that caused that we even jumped into write code. Well, when you are developing you are constantly changing the code. Even if there is no such bug in there at the moment, there might be tomorrow. Besides, no code is bug free  or at least not mine.p  pSo now I am doing some kind of cross checking. I have a variable named wen which I set to 0xa5 before the usual checks e.g. check to make sure that destination is valid. Then just before doing the actual erase or write I check if wen is really set to 0xa5. Otherwise this means that we somehow accidentally jumped into the writing code. After successful write wen is cleared. I have done this in C and it worked well. But there is still slight theoretical chance corruption will happen, cause there are few instructions from this final check of wen till write to SPMCR register.p  pNow I want to improve this by putting this check into assembly, between the write to SPMCR and spm instruction.p  precodeasm volatile         lds zeroreg, 0nt     out 1, 2nt     ldi r25, 3nt     add zeroreg, r25nt     brne spmfailnt     spmnt     rjmp spmdonent     spmfail clr zeroregnt     call assertnt     spmdone           i uint16tampwen,       I SFRIOADDRSPMREG,       r uint8tBOOTPAGEERASE,       M uint8tACK,       z uint16tadr     r25  codepre  pHavent tried the code yet, will do that tomorrow.

Im looking to build AR apps on the iphone and this code has the function of calculating the angle of inclination of the device using the accelerometer readings.p  pMy understanding is thisp  pAssuming a portrait orientation if i roll the device forward the x axis of the accelerometer increases towards a negative number of 1.0 i.e. the device is laid flat with the screen facing up. If i tilt the device towards me the x axis value increases towards a value of 1.0 until the device is flat facing the ground.p  pThe y axis changes up and down its axis between 1.0 and 0.0 0 implies the device is horizontal.p  pIf we take some example readings say x  0.5 a 45 degree angle, tilting the device towards me and y  0.8. If i plotted this on a cartesian coordinate graph with y rollingX as the vertical axis and x rollingZ as the horizontal and draw a line between them i understand that i can use the reverse tangent function atan to calculate the angle. My confusion comes on line 1. I dont understand why that line adds 90 degrees in radians to the calculated angle given by the atan functionp  pI just cant seem to visualise on a graph whats going on. If someone could shed some light on this  that would be much appreciated.p

Negative 6262 pI there any other possibility to handle with Ember.Router controllers and views My app structure generally depends on require.js which takes care of the corresponding dependencies.p  pIn my example im doing the App.ApplicationController thing as the main router controller.p  pHeres a jsfiddle a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netmediastuttgartuMKGt1 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netmediastuttgartuMKGt1ap  pBut is there any chance to set this manually Ive found this commit message a hrefhttpsgithub.comemberjsember.jscommitbe69395f5eec4187b1df052d7386bcda45f79475 relnofollowhttpsgithub.comemberjsember.jscommitbe69395f5eec4187b1df052d7386bcda45f79475a where i can see, how to set the controller and view manually anyway couldnt get this working.

While we use require.js to manage or dependencies, we have multiple controllers which are responsible for their own parts of the entire application. Lets say we have a newsletter signup form. The controller used for this scenario is structured inp  precode app  controller  newsletter  signup.js  cart  checkout  view  model  router  template codepre  pAs we use a custom function to generate namespaces codeEm.ProvideApp.Controller.Newslettercode which creates an object at codeApp.Controller.Newslettercode.

Negative 6262 pBasically, I have a button that when you press it, it runs its action methond changes a field in my Data class and segues into another view which displays the field.  After some debugging I realized that prepareSegue, and perhaps other related methods run before my buttons action, and thus display the old field value instead of the new.  Is there anyway around this.  I was thinking maybe instead of segueing on the button press, I would create a segue to my first scene and segue to it at the end of my buttons action method, but am not sure how to set the destination of a segue made programmatically.  Or is there a better way to update the field before segueing  Thanks in advance.p
Negative 6262 pI am really sad that a few days we launched our software made in .Net 4.0 Desktop application and after 3 days its crack is available on the internet.

If the credentials are correct then the software saves the values in the Registry and sends the MachineID back to the server and stores it in the database.p  pNow, the hacker has replaced the Server communication with a return true statement. and he has uploaded the cracked software on the net. I checked that with Telrik JustDecompile.p  pNow, following are my questions br  1 How to make sure that .Net application will not get cracked  br 2 The hacker now knows my code since he has done the modification.

Negative 6262 pSo Im trying to capture the output of HandBrakeCLI as a Python subprocess. This is not a problem with stderr as each update creates a new line in the filelike pipe.

Negative 6262 pWe are using XSD.EXE to generate runtime classes from an XSD schema for XML serialization. The schema is large and contains many complex types and choice elements. As described in a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenusmagazinecc164135.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenusmagazinecc164135.aspxa, choice elements generate two fields an Item field to hold the value and an ItemChoiceType field which holds a generated enum defining which named element is in the Item field.p  pXSD creates a unique enum for each of these element name fields named ItemChoiceTypeXX, where XX is an integer.

Negative 6262 pI have been trying to make sense of Androids developer docs concerning the inapp subscriptions capability that was included in the Market Billing API v2 earlier this year.  All of the documentation seems to talk about inapp billing and only briefly mentions subscriptions implementation and testing.p  pI have downloaded the Dungeons sample application which does not implement subscriptions.  I have set up a test app which defines two of my own subscription products.  When I purchased a 9.99year subs, it did charge me.  I failed to store the purchase token correctly, so there was no actual delivery my fault.  I then attempted to refund my order through Google Checkout so I could restart the test, and it did not give me a refund.  It actually charged my credit card, and I did not capture the purchase token, so there is no way for me to revive the old transaction that I know of.

Negative 6262 pIm trying to write a large number of fields from a Class to a csv. E.g.p  precodefor i in range0,  lent     t.writerow[t[i].a,  t[i].b,  t[i].c,...] codepre  pHowever I have a subclass which I also want to write at the end of this listp  precodefor i in range0,  lent     t.writerow[  t[i].a,  t[i].b,  t[i].c,...  t[i].z[0].s,  t[i].z[1].s ...] codepre  pHowever Im not sure how I achieve this, the subclasses are of varying lengths, so how would I ensure that each row just appends the relevant number of subclasses at the end I cant find anything in the a hrefhttpdocs.python.org2librarycsv.html relnofollowdocumentationa about it. Do I make a string out of the subclass entries, and then just paste one entry at the end Thanks.p

Negative 6262 pBasically, the language has 3 list and 3 fixedlength types, one of them is string. This is simple to detect the type of a token using regular expressions, but splitting them into tokens is not that trivial.p  pString is notated with doublequote, and doubleqoute is escaped with backslash.p  pEDITp  pSome example codep  precode      print sum 1 2 3 4      if [ 2  3  lt 6]  print Smaller  codepre  pLists likep  ul li are argument lists that are only evaluated when necessary.li li[] are special list to express 2 operand operations in a prettier way.li li are lists that are always evaluated. First element is a function name, second is a list of arguments, and this repeats.li lianything  anything [  anything [ ...]] translate to argument lists that have the elements joined by the s. This is only for making loops and conditionals look better.li ul  pAll functions take a single argument. Argument lists can be used for functions that need more. You can fore and argument list to evaluate using different types of eval functions. There would be eval functions for each list modelp  pSo, if you understand this, this works very similar like Lisp does, its only has different list types for prettifying the code.p  pEDIT ricip  pcode[[2  3] lt 6]code is OK too. As I mentioned, argument lists are evaluated only when its necessary. Since codeltcode is a function that requires an argument list of length 2, code2  3code must be evaluated somehow, other ways it code[2  3 lt 6]code would translate to codelt 2  3  6code which equals to codelt 2  3 6code which is and invalid argument list for codeltcode. But I see you point, its not trivial that how automatic parsing in this case should work. The version that I described above, is that the code[...]code evaluates arguments list with a function like codeevalasoplist ...code But I guess you are right, because this way,  you couldnt use an argument list in the regular way inside a code[...]code which is problematic even if you dont have a reason to do so, because it doesnt lead to a better code. So code[[. . .] . .]code is a better code, I agree. p

Negative 6262 pIve been able to use modelview matrix and functions like codeglTranslatefcode and codegluLookAtcode to transform an object or the perspective of the entire scene, but when I try to do both I run into problems.p  pIt seems that regardless of the parameters I use for codegluLookAtcode, the objects I draw are displayed from the same angle.

The objects move they are supposed to, but I can only get them to appear from one viewpoint.p  pFor instance, since they should be moving in the xy plane, and are circling counterclockwise, I would think that changing codez0code to code30code would make them appear to be moving clockwise, but it doesnt seem to make any difference.

Negative 6262 pI have developed a .net library for XInput using Pinvoke, and am now getting ready to implement it into a gui WPF.p  pI have had a look at the BackgroundWorker class, and have got it working as a test for 1 controller, but its a hack job and clearly it wouldnt be suitable for 24 controllers this was mainly done to see what I needed to do with the gui.p  pSo Im asking some more of the experienced people here, on how to approach the threading in this app. Should I continue with the BackgroundWorker class or look at TPL in .net 4, or some other methodp  pThe worker thread is required as there is no messaging system for XInput, only a polling system. The worker thread would check input roughly every 20ms or something like that Thread.Sleep. I am also not sure if there should be only 1 worker thread for all controllers or 4 worker threads there is a max controller limit of 4.p  pIm a bit new to WPF and .NET in general, so any advice welcome p

Negative 6262 pIve been having multiple problems trying to show codeGridViewItemscode in a codeGridViewcode in different layouts. Basically EVERYTHING kills virtualization. If we use a codeVariableSizedWrapGridcode virutalizaiton is gone, if we use the built in grouping functionality virtualizaiton is also gone. So far the only solutionp  pa hrefhttparchitects.dzone.comarticlessolvingwinrtxamlgridviewOnly Solutionap  pBut that doesnt really cut it because it changes the design so much. As I said, the basic problem is that pretty much any small layout change you make on the codeGridViewcode breaks virtualization. Has anyone found a good way to avoid this problem when changing a codeGridViewcode or has everybody just had to stick with how the codeGridViewcode looks by defaultp  pOh, another thing. Unfortunately WinRT doesnt allow us to create our custom virutalized panel because the codeVirtualizingStackPanelcode constructor is codeprotectedcode or codeprivatecode, cant remember correctly.

Is the message coming from the dll or just from java script hope someone can help it is really important. Thanks.p

Negative 6262 h1Backgroundh1  pIve written a hack for Emacs that lets me send a Clojure form from an editor buffer to a REPL buffer. Its working fine, except that if the two buffers are in different namespaces the copied text doesnt usually make sense, or, worse, it might make sense but have a different meaning to that in the editor buffer.p  pI want to transform the text so that it makes sense in the REPL buffer.p  h1A Solution in Common Lisph1  pIn Common Lisp, I could do this using the following functionp  precode Common Lisp  defun translatetextbetweenpackages text frompackage topackage   let package frompackage          form readfromstring text          package topackage     withoutputtostring standardoutput                            pprint form codepre  pAnd a sample usep  precode Common Lisp  makepackage editorpackage makepackage replpackage  defvar replpackagea  translatetextbetweenpackages  replpackagea b                                  findpackage editorpackage                                  findpackage replpackage  gt  A EDITORPACKAGEB codepre  pThe package name qualifications in the input string and the output string are differentexactly whats needed to solve the problem of copying and pasting text between packages.p  pBTW, theres stuff about how to run the translation code in the Common Lisp process and move stuff between the Emacs world and the Common Lisp world, but Im ok with that and I dont particularly want to get into it here.p  h1A NonSolution in Clojureh1  pHeres a direct translation into Clojurep  precode Clojure  defn translatetextbetweennamespaces [text fromns tons]   let [ns fromns         form readstring text         ns tons]     withoutstr       clojure.pprintpprint form codepre  pAnd a sample usep  precode Clojure  createns editorns createns replns  translatetextbetweennamespaces  replnsa b                                    findns editorns                                    findns replns  gt  replnsa b codepre  pSo the translation function in Clojure has done nothing. Thats because symbols and packagesnamespaces in Common Lisp and Clojure work differently.p  pIn Common Lisp symbols belong to a package and the determination of a symbols package happens at read time.p  pIn Clojure, for good reasons, symbols do not belong to a namespace and the determination of a symbols namespace happens at evaluation time.p  h1Can This Be Done in Clojureh1  pSo, finally, my question Can I convert Clojure code from one namespace to anotherp

Negative 6262 pThis place has always been a wealth of information so Im back again to get some guidance.p  pFirst off I am deeply into learning about App Script but there is so much the Google has to offer im a bit overwhelemed at figuring out what i need.p  pRight now im designing an online volunteer application work flow and eventually other things for a non profit organization. p  pHere is how I envision the process flow going.p  ol liNew user comes up first Web App page asks for first last middle and email addressli liFirst Last Middle are used together in some way to create a domain log on for the user using the provisioning API already figured this part out while prompting the user to create a passwordli liAt this point the user is passed to the actual application web app that runs only for domain users so that the relaxed rules of app script for user behind a domain can be leveraged and also so the entire ebb and flow of information stay behind our domain.li ol  pNow where i am unclear on is the jump from step 2 to step 3.p  pWhat would be the best and most painless for the user not me way to put together the transition from running the entry point app that creates the new users domain account as essentially an anonymous user identity to running the domain level app AS their new domain user identity.

Negative 6262 pI am super new to the iPad applications. I have a created a simple iPad app. MasterViewController with TableView embedded inside the UINavigationController. User taps one of the entries inside tableview that segues him to the WebViewController.p  pBut after i implemented SplitViewController in Storyboard by telling it the Master and Detail View, the navigation bar on top of the detail view is disappeared. I have also implemented the SplitViewController that displays the master view controller on the left side in both portrait and landscape orientation but later removed it.p  pstrongWhat I wantstrong is to show the masterview with tableview inside as it is with no splitviewcontroller, when user taps on one of the tableview entry, it segues to WebViewController This is already happening till this point but when the user reaches WebViewController, if he is in Landscape orientation, the tableview comes as a splitviewcontroller on the left side, if the user is in portrait mode, there should be a button on the navigation bar to show a popovercontroller having the same tableview entries and he can select any other entry without going back. p  pCan anyone help me how to implement this in Storyboards or guide me if i am doing the whole thing wrong. Thanks in advance.p

Negative 6262 pI am wondering how I can find the most occurring color from a CVPixelBufferRef in iOS.

But that would give me the problem 255,0,strong135strong and 255,0,strong134strong would not be the same color, although everybody agrees it is pink. Maybe this, but in steps of 50 or something, and in the end get the middle of that 50  So i.e. the number 153 would be in the range 150200 and thus 175 p  pIt should give me a RGB color or whatever back, but it should have the same feel as the image.. p  pstrongNotestrong its not a problem if it is complicated or whatever, I just want it to be good.

Negative 6262 pIm building a small bytecode VM that will run on a variety of platforms including exotic embedded and microcontroller environments. p  pEach opcode in my VM can be variable lengthno more than 4 bytes, no less than 1 byte. In interpreting the opcodes, I want to create a tiny cache for the current opcode. However, due to it being used on many different platforms, its hard to do.p  pSo, here is a few examples of expected behaviorp  ol liOn an 8bit microcontroller with an 8bit memory bus, Id want it to only load 1 byte because itd take multiple slow memory operations to load anymore, and in theory, it might only require 1 byte to execute the current opcodeli liOn an 808616bit, Id want to load 2 bytes because to only load 1 byte we would basically be throwing some useful data away to be read later, but I dont want to load more than 2 bytes because itd take multiple operationsli liOn a 32bit ARM processor, Id want to load 4 bytes because otherwise were either throwing data thatd might have to be read again away, or were doing multiple operationsli ol  pI would say this could be handled easily by just assuming that codeunsigned intcode is good enough, but on 8bit AVR microcontrollers, int is defined as 16bit, but the memory data bus width is only 8 bit, so 2 memory load operations would be required.p  pAnyway, current ideasp  pusing codeuintfast16tcode seems to work as expected on most platforms 32 bits on ARM, 16 bits on 8086, 64 bits on x8664. However, it clearly still leaves out AVR and other 8bit microcontrollers. p  pI thought using codeuintfast8tcode might work, but it would appear on most platforms that its defined as being codeunsigned charcode, which definitely isnt optimalp  pAlso, there is another problem that must be solved as well unaligned memory access. On x86, this probably isnt going to be a problemin theory it does 2 memory operations, but its probably cached away in hardware, however on ARM I know that doing an unaligned 32bit access could possibly cost 3 times as much as a single aligned 32bit load. If the address is unaligned, I want to load the aligned option and get as much data as possible, but at all costs avoid another memory operationp  pIs there a way to somehow do this using magical preprocessor includes or some such, or does it just require manually defining the optimum cache size before compiling for the platformp

Negative 6262 pWe have a single page application using the AngularJS framework that needs to talk to a API implemented in .NET Web API on a different domain.p  pstrongThe problemstrongp  pThe API is implemented in .NET Web API. To authenticate a user for access to our API we implemented the MVC Single Page Application template. This uses FormsAuthentication to grant acccess to the API. p  pWe used Fiddler to debug. When we visited a controller on the API that required authentication directly in the browser we could confirm that the user was indeed authenticated. When we did a XMLHttpRequest, as suspected, no authentication cookies were sent in the headers. p  pWhat we would like to accomplish is to use FormsAuthentication to access the .NET Web API hopefully through XMLHttpRequests.p  pOne proposed solution to this was to share sessions between the .NET Web API and the MVC.

Negative 6262 pIn several programming languages there are Set collections which are supposed to be  implementations of the mathematical concept of a finite set. p  pHowever, this is not necessarily true, for example in codeCcode and codeJavacode, both implementations of codeHashSetltTgtcode allow you to add any codeHashSetltTgtcode collection as a member of itself. Which by the modern definition of a mathematical set is not allowed. p  pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pAccording to naive set theory, the definition of a set isp  blockquote   pA set is a collection of distinct objects.p blockquote  pHowever, this definition lead famously to a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiRussell27sparadox relnofollowRussels Paradoxa as well as other paradoxes. For convenience, Russels Paradox isp  blockquote   pLet R be the set of all sets that are not members of themselves. If R   is not a member of itself, then its definition dictates that it must   contain itself, and if it contains itself, then it contradicts its own   definition as the set of all sets that are not members of themselves.p blockquote  pSo according to modern set theory See a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiZermeloE28093Fraenkelsettheory relnofollowZFCa, the definition of a set isp  blockquote   pA set is a collection of distinct objects, none of which is the set   itself.p blockquote  pSpecifically, this is a result of the a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiAxiomofregularity relnofollowaxiom of regularitya. p  pemstrongWell so what What are the implications of this Why is this question on StackOverflowemstrongp  pOne of the implications of Russels Paradox is that emnot all collections are setsem. Additionally, this was the point where mathematicians dropped the definition of a set as being the usual English definition. So I believe this question has a lot of weight when it comes to programming language design in general. p  pstrongQuestionsstrongp  pSo why would programming languages, who in some form, use these principles in their very design just ignore it in the implementation of the Set in their languages libraries p  pSecondly, is this a common occurrence with other implementations of mathematical conceptsp  pPerhaps Im being a bit nit picky, but if these are to be true implementations of Sets, then why would part of the very definition be ignoredp  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pstrongAddition of C and Java code snippets exemplifying behaviorstrongp  pstrongJava Snippetstrongp  precodeSetltObjectgt hashSet  new HashSetltObjectgt hashSet.add1 hashSet.addTiger hashSet.addhashSet hashSet.addf  Object[] array  hashSet.toArray HashSetltObjectgt hash  HashSetltObjectgtarray[3]  System.out.printlnHashSet in HashSet        for Object obj  hash     System.out.printlnobj  System.out.printlnnPrinciple HashSet for Object obj  hashSet     System.out.printlnobj codepre  pstrongWhich prints outstrongp  precodeHashSet in HashSet f 1 Tiger [f, 1, Tiger, this Collection]  Principle HashSet f 1 Tiger [f, 1, Tiger, this Collection] codepre  pstrongC Snippetstrongp  precodeHashSetltobjectgt hashSet  new HashSetltobjectgt hashSet.Add1 hashSet.AddTiger hashSet.AddhashSet hashSet.Addf  object[] array  hashSet.ToArray var hash  HashSetltobjectgtarray[2]  Console.WriteLineHashSet in HashSet foreach object obj in hash      Console.WriteLineobj  Console.WriteLinenPrinciple HashSet foreach object obj in hashSet      Console.WriteLineobj codepre  pstrongWhich prints outstrongp  precodeHashSet in HashSet 1 Tiger System.Collections.Generic.HashSet1[System.Object] f  Principle HashSet 1 Tiger System.Collections.Generic.HashSet1[System.Object] f codepre  pstrongUpdate 2strongp  pIn regards to strongMartijn Courteauxstrongs second point which was that it could be done in the name of computational efficiency p  pI made two test collections in C.

Negative 6262 pQuestion regarding pythonctypes and dll loading. p  pI have created a C Dll extern C declarations using VSExpress 2010.  I can load and execute this dll with a CPP test program.

Triple checked the path to the DLL on the python side and tried an absolute path to be completely sure the DLL is being found. p  p2.

I have a .bat file that sets all my environment variables and have taken other actions as well colocating dependencies to make sure all dependencies are resolved.  Again, everything in depends is showing clean except the typical Win7 OS failures. p  pAnyone know a good way to debug this type of problem  A better version of depends  A way to see exactly what symbolmodule failed to load from python  p  pAgain, the CPP test program loads and execute the dll perfectly.  Really not sure what is happening on the Python side.  Any help in debugging is appreciated.p  pThanks.p

Negative 6262 pIm working on a proofofconcept timesheet application in C that allows users to simply enter lots of timesheet records. The proofofconcept will use RavenDB as storage provider, however the question below is perhaps more related to the nosql concept in general.p  pA user will typically enter between 1 and about 10 records each working day.

Think of on the fly reports likep  ul liTotal time spent for a project, customer or userli liTime spent for a project, or customer in a certain time span like a week, month or between certain datesli liTotal amount of hours not approved already, by user  or for all usersli liEtc.li ul  pOf course, it is an option to add additional fields, like integers for weeknumber, month etc. to decrease the amount of crunching needed to filter on dateperiod.

With or without normalization this woulb be a breeze.

Like in adding hours spent by a certain user in a Project or Customer object. This, however, will increase complexity with updates considerably. Not to mention create immense redundant data all over the collections, which on its turn seems like a direct violation of seperation of concern and DRY.p  pAny advise or thoughts would be greatp

Negative 6262 pI have working an example of using the multipart functionality of Fine Uploader with Amazon S3.  However I would like to know how it should be used.

But how is the resume recalled  Is it via a session cookie  If the user completely deletes all cookies, and history, can the resume still work  What needs to persist in order to resume a broken upload  Is it all dependent on the key generated for the object  As long as the key is the same  Can you provide some scenarios in which the resume upload works and when it would not  Thanks.p

Negative 6262 pIn MySQL a field was created with ON UPDATE CURRENTTIMESTAMP designation. This saves the record update date in the servers timezone. I want to convert this time to UTC time. p  pThe server is hosted in an account that doesnt have access to the server administration or the MySQL administration so I cant set the timezone on the server or MySQL directly through command line interfaces or startup files or any other way. This includes the SET timezone command or the my.cnf file. p  pI also found a suggestion to use ON UPDATE UTCTIMESTAMP but found this gives a syntax error and is not supported in the documentation. p  pSo what I am trying to do now is to find a select clause that converts the value saved by ON UPDATE CURRENTTIMESTAMP, which is saved in the servers current timezone, and convert it to UTC time. p  pIdeally this clause would detect the servers timezone so the value is not hardcoded and works with whatever timezone the server is set to. p

Negative 6262 pIt is easy to configure emASLem to log messages also to codestderrcode or to log a copy of the message to a log file of my choice using a log format of my choice, but I wonder if it is possible to abuse ASL to only log to such an external file, without passing messages through the standard logging processing e.g. without having the message being processed by the codeasl.confcode file rules and without having it ending up in the code.aslcode binary files That way one could easily make use of the filter and formatting capabilities of emASLem when writing application log files, that shall not appear in Console.app or log so much data, that they would flood the standard log files like system.log.p  hr  pFor those who dont know what emASLem is, its Apples default logging facility for OS X, similar to emsyslogem on other systems in fact the emsyslogem API has became a slim wrapper around emASLem, maintained only for backwards and POSIX compatibility.

The implementation of codeINotifyTaskCompletionltTResultgtcode is not complicated, abbreviated codetask.ContinueWitht gt  PropertyChangedthis, new PropertyChangedEventArgsResult code  p  pMy understanding is as follows after starting the task, coderaisePropertyChangedInstancesAsynccode has the effect that wpf tries to find codeInstancesAsync.Resultcode. It finds codeInstancesAsynccode because this object is instantiated embeforeem the task starts, but Result is emnullem. After completion of the task, wpf receives codePropertyChangedResultcode and via the emexistingem accessor codeInstancesAsynccode codeResultcode is now found.br The ItemsSource in wpf is populated and now wpf must trigger the Binding for SelectedItem and in this way go to property codeInstancecode. Because in my case, there another async property task is started. For that to happen I need to kick off coderaisePropertyChangedInstancecode after the task completes.p  pI solved it by passing my coderaisePropertyChangedcode as a delegate and the property name as a string to the implementation class of codeINotifyTaskCompletioncode.p  pI am content with this solution, but perhaps I am overlooking somethingbr strongEDITstrongbr it turned out that the straightforward way of Mr. Cleary is correct, however only when codeIsSynchronizedWithCurrentItemTruecode.

Another method sets the texture data like thisp  precodeglTexImage2DGLTEXTURE2D, 0, GLRGBA, w, h, 0, GLRGBA, GLUNSIGNEDBYTE, pixels codepre  pI dont believe that theres something wrong there. The important thing should be the draw method.

It just does not work when I load a texture.

Negative 6262 pHey so I am completely new to Laravel 4 and have some basic questions regarding my first time installation that I was unable to find answers to anywhere else online.  I am planning of hosting a standard website with a fully dynamic web back end and a RESTful API using the framework.  I have been following a hrefhttplaravel.comdocsinstallation relnofollowthis installation guidea and am essentially at the part where I type codelaravel new projectDircode and it creates a new instance of Laravel in the provided directory.  p  pNow my main public directory is codepublichtmlcode, is it recommended to install Laravel 4 directly into that directory.  So is something like codelaravel new publichtmlcode recommended I have found many other questions here that seem to suggest that this is not the safest solution.  Should I make a separate directory inside publichtml, is it necessary for what I am planning on doing with laravel  p  pAlso, I would like to keep my URLs as neat as possible and would like them primarily to be codewww.domainname.compagenamecode for the website.  Will creating a directory inside of codepublichtmlcode disable me from doing so  p  pLastly I had some issues with routing my URLs when I tried to install a different framework on this server.  Are there any serverApache settings that would impact how URLs are routed with laravel that I should disableenable before I install Laravel into a directory p

Id prefer to just add this information to the superclass, but it is a requirement for an assignment.p  pSo Im wondering how do I actually go about calling these override methods when I need them to add these new features I keep seeing resources telling me how to create them, but not actually implement them.p  pFrom my main method, I call the dvd class and then print it. however, it only prints whats in the original dvd class, except for the odd addition of adding the year to where the product ID should be.p  precodepublic class DVD     String name int id int items double cost  default constructor public DVD      name       id  0     items  0     cost  0.0 end default constructor  constructor to initialize object public DVDString dvdName, int itemNum, int quantity, double price      name  dvdName     id  itemNum     items  quantity     cost   price end constructor   method to calculate value public double getInventoryValue         return items  cost   method to set name public void setdvdNameString dvdName     this.name  dvdName   method to get name public String getName     return name   method to set id public void setitemNum int itemNum     this.id  itemNum   method to get id public int getId     return id   method to set items public void setquantityint quantity     this.items  quantity      method to get items public int getItems     return items   method to set cost public void setprice double price     this.cost  price   method to get cost public double getCost     return cost        return    public String toString       return DVD Name   getName             ID   getId             Items   getItems             Cost   getCost              Total Value  getInventoryValue   codepre  pp  precodepublic class ExtendedDVD extends DVD double restockFee int year  public ExtendedDVD     year  0  public ExtendedDVDint year      this.year  year   public void setRestockFee     this.restockFee  0.05   public double getRestockFee     return restockFee    public void setYear     this.year  0   public int getYear     return year   Override public double getInventoryValue     double value1  super.getInventoryValue     double value  restockFee  value1     double totalInventoryValue  value  super.getInventoryValue     return totalInventoryValue   Override  public String toString     return super.toString  Year  getYear   codepre  pp  precodepublic class Inventory   DVD[] inventory  new DVD[5] int current  0 private int len  public Inventoryint len     inventory  new DVD[len]    public double calculateTotalInventory      double totalValue  0     for  int j  0 j lt inventory.length j           totalValue  inventory[j].getInventoryValue     return totalValue        param dvd   throws Exception   public void addDVDDVD dvd throws Exception      if current lt inventory.length          inventory[current]dvd     else          Exception myException  new Exception         throw myException            void sort        for DVD inventory1  inventory          len  current             for int i0 iltleni          forint jijltlenj              if inventory[i].getName.compareToinventory[j].getNamegt0                  DVD temp  inventory[j]                 inventory[j]  inventory[i]                 inventory[i]  temp                                   public int getNumberOfItems      return current        public void printInventory      System.out.printlnCurrent Inventory     forint i0iltcurrenti          System.out.printlninventory[i]          System.out.printlnThe total value of the inventory iscalculateTotalInventory       codepre  pp  precodepublic class inventoryprogram1      param args the command line arguments   public static void mainString[] args       boolean finish  false     String dvdName     int itemNum     int quantity     double price     int year  0      Inventory inventory  new Inventory5     while finish          Scanner input  new ScannerSystem.in  Initialize the scanner         System.out.printPlease enter name of DVD          dvdName  input.nextLine         if dvdName.equalsstop              System.out.printlnExiting Program             break          else              System.out.printPlease enter Product Number              itemNum  input.nextInt             System.out.printPlease enter units              quantity  input.nextInt             System.out.printPlease enter price of DVD              price  input.nextDouble             System.out.printPlease enter production year              itemNum  input.nextInt              DVD dvd new DVDdvdName,itemNum,quantity,price              try                inventory.addDVDdvd             catch Exception e                  System.out.printlnInventory is full.                 break                           System.out.printlnDVD   dvd          end else              inventory.sort        inventory.printInventory   codepre

Negative 6262 pI have a project in eclipse indigo where I access SQL data using Hibernate.p  pI have set up a couple of classes and used annotations to manually map to the tables. I have added a driver jar file sqljdbc4.jar to the build path and entered the path to folder containing sqljdbcauth.dll as native library location under the driver jar file in order to support integrated security.p  pI can access the data using JDBC connection to my SQL Server 2012, that uses integrated security and that I have defined in emhibernate.cfg.xmlem. p  pAs the next step, Id like to generate classes from the remaining SQL tables automatically. So I installed Hibernate tools from JBOSS site and Im trying to follow through the necessary steps Ive created a console configuration based on my hibernate configuration file. Now in Hibernate perspective of my project I see three items Configuration, Session factory and Database. In properties of Configuration I see my connection url and other settings.p  pHowever when I click on Database I receive an error codeorg.hibernate.exception.JDBCConnectionException Getting database metadatacode that boils down to the codeCaused by java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError no sqljdbcauth in java.library.pathcodep  ol liit seems that the tool ignores the project setup  it picks up the jar, but not path to dll, and li liI see no way how to add the folder with dll to the emjava.library.pathemli ol  pIve tried to use set codejava.library.pathcode using codehibernate.propertiescode file and referencing this file in console configuration. This seems to be doing half the job as in Configuration item now I can see the folder included in codejava.library.pathcode. However it does not change anything when I try to click on Database or configure a code generation configuration  still codeno sqljdbcauth in java.library.pathcode error.p  pThe only workaround I have found so far is to drop my dll in any folder that shows by default in emjava.library.pathem. Then I can configure the code generation configuration and create the classes. However 64bit dll in the default path gets loaded and causes conflict for example when I need 32bit version of it from another application, so Id rather do it properly and reference asneeded.p  pMaybe it is possible to add the path under emClasspathem tab in emConsole Configurationem, but it all looks what it says  classpath and say adding my folder to it does not change anything.p  pId like to know how to configure emjava.library.pathem correctly for the Hibernate tools. Any ideas Is it possiblep
Negative 6262 pI have an abstract test case using the codeTheoriescode runner which tests an interface.

Negative 6262 pI am developing an iPhone application that uses Cocos3d. I have drawn a scene in the XZ plane  y  0 . Now, I want to rotate the scene around a specified point in the XZ plane, whenever the user touches the screen with two fingers the rotation point will be the center of the two touch points.p  pI started by projecting the two touch points to the 3D scene, by finding the intersecting between the CC3Ray issued from the camera and passing by the touch point and the XZ plane. Now that I have the two points in the XZ plane, I can calculate the rotation point that will be the middle point between these two points.p  pIn order to rotate the scene around this point, I have added it to a parent node. Now all I have to do is to translate it by the negation of the coordinates of the middle point, rotate its parent by the angle, and translate it back by the coordinates of middle point.p  pHere is the code that I am using in the ccTouchesMoved methodp  precode Assuming that the root is a CC3Node and it is the scene that I need to rotate  and middle refers to the center of rotation  [root translateBycc3vmiddle.x, 0, middle.z] [root.parent rotateByAngle30 aroundAxiscc3v0, 1, 0] [root translateBycc3vmiddle.x, 0, middle.z] codepre  pHowever, I am not able to rotate the scene around the middle point. Can anyone help me to resolve this problemp  pThank youp  pEditp  pI also tried to add these lines of codes in the ccTouchesBegan methodp  precode[root translateByCC3VectorNegatemiddle] [self.cc3Scene.activeCamera translateByCC3VectorNegatemiddle] codepre  pAnd in the ccTouchesMovedp  precode[root rotateByAngleangle aroundAxiscc3v0, 1, 0] codepre  pIt works only for the first time the user touches the screen, and then, whenever heshe touches it again, a unwanted translation is happening I think the problem is with the ccTouchesBegan method.p

Ugh.p  pIs it possible to put these definitions somewhere where they will be included in every page I tried putting them in a layout but it seems that Jekyll wont parse markdown in layouts.p  pIm also open to alternatives to ALDs if this is not the right way to go about things.p

Negative 6262 pLong time Stack Overflow creeper. This community has come up with some incredibly elegant solutions to rather perplexing questions.p  pIm more of a CSS3 or PHP kinda guy when it comes to handling dynamically displayed content. Ideally someone with a solid knowledge base of jQuery andor Javascript would be able to answer this one best. Here is the idea, along with the thought process behind itp  pCreate a Full Screen width100 heightauto backgroundcover Video background. But instead of going about using HTML5s video tag, a flash fallback, iFrame, or even .GIF, create a series of images, much like the animation render output of say Cinema4D, that if put together in sequential order create a seamless pseudovideo experience. p  pIn Before THATs JUST A .GIF, YOURE AN IDIOT Guy.p  pI believe jQueryJavascript could solve this. Would it or would it not be possible to write a script that essentially recognizes or even adds the div class of an image, then sets that image to display for say .0334ms 29.7 frame rate then sets this image back in z space while at the same time firing in the next image within the sequential class order to display for another .0336ms and so on and so forth until all of the images or frames play out seamlessly fluid, so the user would assume heshe is actually seeing a video. Not a knowing its actually a .GIF on steroids.p  pHeres a more verbose way of explaining the intended resultp  pYou have a 1 second super awesome 1080p video clip video format doesnt matter for helping to answer this question, just assume its lossless and really pretty k. Its recorded at 29.97 frames per second. Break each frame into its own massive image file, leaving you with essentially 30 images. 24 frames a second would mean youd have 24 images, 60 frames per second would mean youd have 60 images, etc., etc., excedera.p  pIf you have ever used Cinema4D, the output I am looking to recreate is reflexive to that of an animation render, where you are left with a .TIFF per frame, placed side by side so that when uploaded into Photoshop or viewed in Quicktime you get a slideshow of images displaying so fast it look likes a video.p  pHTML would look something like thisp  precodeltdiv idincrediblevideogt      ltdiv classimage1gt         ltimg sourceurl..moviesceneone.tiffgt      ltdivgt      ltdiv classimage2gt         ltimg sourceurl..moviescenetwo.tiffgt      ltdivgt      ltdiv classimage3gt         ltimg sourceurl..moviescenethree.tiffgt      ltdivgt      ltdiv classimage4gt         ltimg sourceurl..moviescenefour.tiffgt      ltdivgt      ltdiv classimage5gt         ltimg sourceurl..moviescenefive.tiffgt      ltdivgt      ....etc.....      ....etc.....      ....etc..... ltdivgt codepre  pjQueryJavascript could handle appending the sequential image classes instead of writting it all out by hand for each frame.p  pCSS would look likep  precodeincrediblevideo img       positionabsolute      width100      heightauto      backgroundcover  codepre  pBut what would the jQueryJavascript need to be to pull the offcan it be done It would need to happen right after window load, and run on an infinite loop. Ofcourse audio is not happening in this example, but say we dont need it. Say we just want our End User to have a visually appealing page, with a minimal design implemented in the UI.p  pI love video animation, and really love sites built with Full Screen Backgrounds. But a site out with this visual setup and keeping it responsive is proving to strenuous a challenge. HTML5 will only get you so far, and makes mobile compatibility null and void data usage protection. .GIF files are MASSIVE compared to calling in a .mp4, .Webm, or .OGG so that option is out. p  pIve actually recently played around with Adobe Edge Animate. Using the Edge Hero .js library I was able to reproduce a similar project to this a hrefhttpwww.edgehero.comtutorialsstarwarscrawltutorial relnofollowhttpwww.edgehero.comtutorialsstarwarscrawltutorialap  pI found it worked on ALL devices. Very cool. Made me think that maybe its possibly to use this program or hit jQueryJavascript directly to achieve the desired effect.p  pThanks for taking a look at this one guys.p  pCheers, Branden Danep

Negative 6262 pI have a multiband raster where I want to apply a function to the values that each pixel has across all the bands. Depending on the result, a new value is assigned, and a new singleband raster is generated from these new values.

I am doing some tests on an three dimensional array using numpy but I am not able to resolve the last part, where the new values are assigned.p  pThe function to be applied to the 3 dimensional array is TrendList. I have defined it in the begining. To be easier to iterate through the array values on the z or 0 axis I have used np.swapaxes thank you Fabricator for this.

Negative 6262 pIm managing a workbook with more than 200 000 formulas some really complicated array formulas which means that I cant let Excel automatically calculate all the cells every time I click somewhere it takes around 8 hours to calculate everything.p  pInstead of that, the calculation is set to manual and I have the following VBA code executed when emCalculation.xlsmem is openedp  precodeWith Application     .CalculateBeforeSave  False     .Calculation  xlCalculationManual End With codepre  pI use custom buttons to calculate only some parts of the 200k cells when needed.p  pI noticed that Excel does keep track of that setting in each workbooks, which means that if I open my Calculation.xlsm, Excel remembers that the calculation is set to manual. If I open my Values.xlsx, Excel does remember that the calculation is set to automatic. This was before I tried to copy values from emCalculation.xlsmem to emValues.xlsxem.p  pNow, because Im using VBA in Calculation.xlsm to copy values to Values.xlsx, Excel does apply the codeApplication.Calculationcode setting to that workbook too, which means that if I open it with a new instance of Excel, the calculation will still be set to manually.p  pIf I add a codeApplication.Calculation  xlCalculationAutomaticcode before closing the emValues.xlsxem with VBA in my emCalculation.xlsmem workbook, it will work, but Excel will also start to compute the 200k cells in my emCalculation.xlsmem workbook, which I obviously dont want.p  pSo my question is about how to actually set the calculation of Excel based on a specific workbook instead of with the codeApplicationcode object. This is based on the fact that Excel does keep track of that setting depending on which workbook is opened you can just do the test and create 2 different em.xlsxem files, one with the calculation enabled and the other with the calculation disabled and Excel will remember these settings.p  pI know I could use the codeWorksheets.Range.Calculatecode method to calculate my Values.xlsx workbook before closing it, but the calculation will still be set to manual if I open it in a new instance of Excel after that.p  hr  pstrongEDIT 320pmstrong Not sure if I was clear enough, English isnt my native language. In short, I have emCalculation.xlsmem with VBA and codeCalculationcode set to manual. I have emValues.xlsxem with no VBA and Calculation set to automatic.

Thats the problem. I would like it to stay on automatic and I cant add VBA to that file, it must be all done from emCalculation.xlsmem like above.p  hr  pstrongEDIT 340pmstrong Could I just have my big workbook with Application.Calculation set to manual, put all the data I need in the clipboard I only need the values, not the formulas, close it will the VBA still continue to execute even if I close the workbook from which it is executed, set Application.Calculation to Auto since there is no open workbook, then open the destination workbook to paste the values will Excel still keep the data in the clipboard since the other workbook is closed, then save and close that workbook, set back the calculation to manual no workbook opened and reopen the original workbook from which the code was executedp

Negative 6262 pI have a function while I would like to manipulate symbolically as well as numerically. That is, take derivatives as well as evaluate the function at certain points. I thought, perhaps incorrectly, the best way to do this in generality would be to have a user defined class with two member functions one that provides the derivative with all the symbolic c stuff being private and the other that does the substitution and spits out the function value when provided with parameter and variable values.p  pHowever, I am having some trouble constructing the symbolic bits within the private class member bitp  precodeclass fitFunction      Symbolic tt, AA, BB     float p1, p2, time     Symbolic fn A1expBt public     fitFunctionvectorltfloatgt amp, float      float evaluate          return fn[A  p1, B  p2, t  time]         fitFunctionfitFunction vectorltfloatgt  amp pars, float tt  p1  pars[0] p2  pars[1] time  tt  codepre  pI used the rather sloppy tt definition to avoid possible conflicts with the symbolic version, but the main error I get is Expected identifier before string constant with an arrow pointing to the Symbolic definition of t, and all the others as well. Obviously since these arent declared properly, everything else craps out.p  pIt is perhaps worth pointing out the symbolic definitions and manipulations work fine in main.p  pThanksp
Negative 6262 pThere is a dictionary with three keys Animals, Birds and Fish.p  pThe main dialog has two List views. The left view codeviewAcode displays the list of the keys mentioned above.  When one of its items is clicked the right view codeviewBcode displays the list of the species.p  pThe question is how to manage codeviewBcodes display... Lets say the user clicks Animals codelistBcode goes ahead and builds a brand new list of QListWidgetItem for every animal in a list. Then the user clicks Birds. What should I do with already built codeviewBcodes animal items Should I hide them hiding Animals items instead of deleting would allow me unhide them later when Animals is clicked again makes total sense if ListItems are heavy on graphics thumbs, icons and etc. If a list of animals is 1000 there will be a noticeable difference between rebuilding the ListItems from scratch and unhiding the ones that were build on a last click.br Another approach I see is to user codeviewB.clearcode every time codeviewAcodes item is clicked. So the codelistBcode items are rebuilt every time codelistAcode item is clicked. But as I have mentioned with a long list of items it could be really slow.

But my unit data 2K is much larger than int 4. So, I am not sure how many neighbours will be cached.p

Negative 6262 pI want to insert a set of n values expressed as a vector into a corresponding set of locations in a matrix.  The realworld application involves inserting a set of n sea surface temperature values into an image of a region that is represented as a grid with dimension nrow x ncol  n in for which I have identified the n water pixels that should receive the temperature values.  The problem Ive run into is that the temperature values are ordered as if they were from a columnmajor matrix rather than the rowmajor ordering used to index the R grid.p  pHere is a toy example of what I mean.p  precodegt grid lt matrix0,4,4 gt grid                        define the base grid      [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [1,]    0    0    0    0 [2,]    0    0    0    0 [3,]    0    0    0    0 [4,]    0    0    0    0  gt temps lt c9,9,9,9,9      we have 5 temperature values gt locs lt c2,3,4,6,7       locations in the base grid that are water  gt grid[locs] lt temps        not really what I want  substitution in rowmajor order gt grid      [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [1,]    0    0    0    0 [2,]    9    9    0    0 [3,]    9    9    0    0 [4,]    9    0    0    0 codepre  pThe desired result would be ratherp  precode     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [1,]    0    9    9    9 [2,]    0    9    9    0 [3,]    0    0    0    0 [4,]    0    0    0    0 codepre  pI suppose I could play with transposing the grid, doing the substitution and then transposing it back, but Id think there would be a better way to approach this problem.p

My code working like this, First person logs in with facebook account he is redirected back to main page, why the main page  because there is a possibility that the user is not a new user and he entered his full name in his first log in, so in the main page the php script checking if this user have entered his full name and if not the script redirecting him to the input page there he is filling his full name.

Negative 6262 pIm creating a HOME codeandroid.intent.category.HOMEcode typed application which launchs another app as soon as the first one is launched.

Ive tried launching many different apps and with every single one of them happens the same thing. The aforementioned intent is never launched. Only after pressing back repeatedly and getting back to the HOME typed app it is launched it must be done repeatedly since the app launches every time in onResume the second app. If it is never launched by the system, the wifi service, tethering and many more will not function.p  pInterestingly if I omit the launch of the second app, the intent is fired. p  pIm thinking on trying to launch the app as soon as the HOME app fragment becomes visible but I have no idea as of how to do it.

Negative 6262 pUsing codeiOS 8, Xcode 6code. p  pLets say I have 2 dynamic frameworks, codeframeworkAcode and codeframeworkBcode and they are both dependent on codelibCcode. In addition, I have an app that uses both codeframeworkAcode and codeframeworkBcode. My original thought was to make codeframeworkAcode and codeframeworkBcode umbrella frameworks and codelibCcode a subframework. However, Apple advises against umbrella framework and this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7365578whyareumbrellaframeworksdiscouragedrq1posta describes why umbrella framework is a bad idea due to potential linker conflict issue. p  pMy second option is to use cocoapods still new to this so a bit fuzzy on details to use codelibCcode as a pod which then gets compiled into codeframeworkAcode and codeframeworkBcode. However, it occurred to me that both frameworks still has its own copy of the codelibCcode. Since the app uses both frameworks, will this result in a linker conflict issue as well Is there a better way to solve this problemp  pstrongUPDATEstrong Rob The projects I work on do require complex dependency management but I kept the problem domain simple in the question to try to better understand how and if using cocoapods can help solve the linker conflict issue with umbrella frameworks. I work with a team of developers who write libraries and can depend on each others base libraries that provide versioned common APIs. We are required to package and deliver as few libraries as possible to a different organization that is building an app with our libraries and one of their key requirement is that we deliver a dynamic framework.  p

Negative 6262 pWhat I am trying to do might not be possible.p  pI have a LAMP development server running ubuntu 14.10. I access it via an IP address.p  pI have two folders on this server, admin and frontend. The web pages in those folders have various links using absolute paths e.g. cssstyle.css, and when you view 0.0.0.0frontend, the absolute path is wrong and you dont get the CSS file. I want to somehow map admin.domain.dev or similar URL to 0.0.0.0admin, and the same for frontend. I have mapped those domains to the IP of my server in my hosts file.p  pI thought I might be able to detect which subdomain was being used by .htaccess and map it to the appropriate folder. I have not been able to get this to work, but it could be that this is impossible, or my codemodrewritecode is wrong.p  pIve triedp  precodeRewriteEngine On RewriteBase   RewriteCond HTTPHOST admin.domain.dev [NC] RewriteRule admin.domain.dev admin [L] codepre  pand a few similar variations with no luck.p

Negative 6262 pThis is the first time I look into requirejs. Ive been doing that by porting an old project of mine. So far its coming along well. Until now.p  pWhat Ive always done is keeping a site settings object containing system settings such as window height, window width, document height, scrolltop etc. In there I updated those values with resize and scroll events. Those were always global variables that I could access.p  pstrongFor example using jQuerystrongp  pdiv classsnippet datalangjs datahidefalse div classsnippetcode pre classsnippetcodejs langjs prettyprintoverridecodevar mySettingsObject   mySettingsObject.Init  function    this.winWidth  window.width    window.resizefunctione      mySettingsObject.winWidth  window.width      document.readyfunction    mySettingsObject.Init codepre div div p  pNow I can access that variable by calling mySettingsObject.winWidth at any time from any function and it will always be up to date.p  pWhat I am trying to understand is how I can have the same behaviour using module dependency in requirejsp  pstrongThese are my two example modulesstrongp  pdiv classsnippet datalangjs datahidefalse div classsnippetcode pre classsnippetcodejs langjs prettyprintoverridecodedefinesystem, function     Window settings    var winWidth  window.width   window.resizefunctione      winWidth  window.width       return      winWidth winWidth         is run on dom load definemyModule, [system], functionsystem    window.onresize, function      if system.winHeight  xyz         do something         codepre div div p  pThe system.winHeight works as expected and gives me the window height as it was on dom load.

Negative 6262 pI am using Ratchet a hrefhttpsocketo.me relnofollowhttpsocketo.mea for websockets in my PHP application. I have multiple virtual machines running the application and each of these machines also host the websocket service. Requests are passed to one of these virtual machines through HAProxy. Also currently the user uses the websocket service on the same node it connects for the application.p  pNow I have a problem with the websocket servers discussing with each other.  For examplep  ul liuser1 connects to node1 and user2 connects to node2li liUser1 sends websocket message through websocket to user2li liUser2 never gets this message because he is connected to another nodeli ul  pWhat are good practices doing this kind of messaging I have some ideas but not sure what way to gop  ol liEach client connects to each websocket node.li liServers publish the messages to all other nodes as wellli liUse database to synchronize the messages between nodesli ol  pBoth 1st and 2nd options are not very scalable if new nodes are attached to the cloud. 3rd option will cause some lag because it is necessary to check if messages from other nodes are in database in loop. p  pAre there any other options to handle situations like this Thanks for the answersp

Negative 6262 pFirst I would like to say that I am discovering the world of SSL socket and there is not so much material online, Ive went through most of the topics on StackOverflow, and I am still confused with the notions of TrustManager, KeyStore, HostNameVerfier... So I have to code a Java client OneWay SSL to connect with some servers using SSL. I am making three behaviors, the native one of Android I belive its if the cert is not trusted it does not process to the handshake. A Naive one, with a custom TrustManager with empty checkServerTrusted function. And now I want to use the HostNameVerfier to allow all the hostname. But honestly I am a little bit lost and Ive searched since days and days and there is no good material about android ssl on the internet.

Negative 6262 pIm attempting to create a Core Graphics pattern in iOS based on user input. I dont have much experience with drawing and am stuck on where to begin. The pattern will be a rows and columns of squares. At some point the color of the squares will change, likely midrow, based on what the pattern is counting for the user.p  pFor now, Im simply trying to draw the basic pattern, and will work into the customization later. The views frame and bounds are set using a storyboard. My initial thought was to draw the squares with a loop. For example, if I wanted to draw a 52x80 grid of 3x3 squares offset by 1, I could do the followingp  precode voiddrawRectCGRectrect       CGRect square  CGRectMake0,0,3,3      UIBezierPath path  [UIBezierPath bezierPathWithRectsquare]     [[UIColor redColor] setStroke]     [[UIColor redColor] setFill]      for int i  0 ilt52 i4        for int i  j jlt80 j4          [path moveToPointCGPointMakei, j]         [path fill]              codepre  pObviously, this doesnt work. A full answer isnt necessary if youd rather just provide a little guidance on where to look or where Im going wrong. p
Negative 6262 pMy partner created a project in XCode and committed it to GitHub. No new changes were made. When either of us tries to bring down the project on our computers, the Storyboard appears to be missing every single UI element UITextField, UIButton, UILabel, and UITextView. The View Controllers show up, but all of them are empty  blank. In the list view, the elements are there but are grayed out. The project still runs perfectly. If I try to open the Storyboard with an external editor, it still exists as an XML file. Apparently, the elements are still there but they simply fail to show up when the Storyboard is displayed. We are both using the latest XCode, Version 6.2 6C131e. My partner just upgraded to the latest version of Yosemite a couple of days ago, and I am running OSX 10.9.5. The code is in Swift.p

Negative 6262 pI need some advice on how to design an asynchronous FIFO. I understand the meta stability issue when capturing data into a different clock domain, my question is how does using a two flip flop shift register assist in synchronization of write pointer and read pointer values for full and empty flag calculation.  When register captures a data of a different domain there is a possibility it can enter a metastable state and can settle to a unknown value, so how do u effectively resolve this issue. p  pThanksp
Negative 6262 pMSVC and ICC both support the intrinsics codeaddcarryu64code and codeaddcarryxu64code.p  pAccording to a hrefhttpssoftware.intel.comsiteslandingpageIntrinsicsGuide relnofollowIntels Intrinsic Guidea and a hrefhttpwww.intel.comcontentwwwusenintelligentsystemsinteltechnologyialargeintegerarithmeticpaper.html relnofollowwhite papera these should map to codeadcxcode and codeadoxcode respectively. However, by looking at the generated assembly its clear they map to codeadccode and codeadcxcode respectively and there is no intrinsic which maps to codeadoxcode.p  psAdditionally, telling the compiler to enable AVX2 with codearchAVX2code in a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.combvcblogarchive20140228avx2supportinvisualstudioccompiler.aspx relnofollowMSVCa or codemarchcoreavx2code with ICC on Linux makes no difference.s  Im not sure how to enable ADX with MSVC and ICC.p  pThe a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryhh977022.aspx relnofollowdocumentation for MSVCa lists codeaddcarryxu64code with the technology of ADX whereas codeaddcarryu64code has no listed technology. However, the link in MSVCs documentation for these intrinsics goes directly to the Intel Intrinsic guide which contradicts MSVCs own documentation and the generated assembly.p  pFrom this I conclude that Intels Intrinsic guide and white paper are wrong.p  pThis makes some sense for MSVC sense it does not allow inline assembly it should provide a way to use codeadccode which it does with codeaddcarryu64code.p  pOne of the big advantages of codeadcxcode and codeadoxcode is that they operate on  different flags carry codeCFcode and overflow codeOFcode and this allows two independent parallel carry chains. However, since there is no intrinsic for codeadoxcode how is this possible With ICC at least one can use inline assembly but this is not possible with MSVC in 64bit mode.p

Alright, setting the height at runtime and scrolling the parent scroll view works like expected header scrolls out, 40 pixels remain visible and then the child scrollview fills the rest of the screen below the header.p  pI would expect that NestedScrolling means that I can make a scroll gesture anywhere on the screen touch event caught by parent scroll view and if the parent scroll view has reached the end the nested child scroll view beginns to scroll. However that seems not to be the case neither for simple scroll gestures nor for fling gestures.p  pThe touch event is always handled by nested child scrollview if the touch event begins in its boundaries, otherwise by the parent scrollview.p  pIs that the expected behaviour of nested scrolling or is there an option to change that behaviourp  pI also tried to replace the nested child scroll view with a codeNestedRecyclerViewcode.

Negative 6262 pSo Im developing an android app for our team members rather than general users, and I want to let them add events to a specific google calendar for management purpose. p  pThe old way of doing this is that I shared a calendar with team members using make changes to events permission, then after the calendar have been sync to android, my app can access it by some calendar provider code.p  pThe problems arebr 1. make changes to events permission makes everyone able to see or even delete everything on the management calendar.br 2. I have to make sure everyone have some calendar app and have sync our management calendar, so my app can find it using calendar provider. p  pI was thinking that maybe I can setting my default management account into app with some sort of protection, then add event to my calendar, so no shared calendar was involve, and the process is totally hidden from our members. I thought google calendar api would help but cant find the right way to do it after lots of research. p  pI am kind of lost now. Am I on the right track or should I try some different way Any suggestion would help, thanksp

Then I was able to use the following segment of code insteadp  precodedata List a where  Nil  List a  Cons  Eq a gt a gt List a gt List a codepre  pIt runs fine.

Negative 6262 pI was just wondering if we should do codeobj  nullcode after adding it into an array. strongNote that this is about a special case, read below.strongp  pFirst, lets consider class codeAcode like thisp  precodepublic class A      public void doSomethingB object           some code here       codepre  pand class codeBcode like thisp  precodepublic class B      private final A a     public BA a          this.a  a          public void aMethod           Does something here         a.doSomethingthis       codepre  pUntil now everythings ok. An object of type codeBcode can call the codeAcodes codedoSomethingcode method to edit the object based on some data there.p  pNow lets consider the following situation the codedoSomethingcode adds the object B to an arraylist. Now which if these codes should I usep  precodepublic void doSomethingB b      arrayList.addb     b  null   or public void doSomethingB b      arrayList.addb  codepre  pIn the first codedoSomethingcode we set the object to null, which means that the method caller becomes null. Well, thats OK to me as codedoSomethingcode call is the last statement I need to in my codeaMethodcode. But is it good to do sop

Negative 6262 pSome of the DocumentDB client libraries will auto generate an ID for you if you do not provide one. I have seen it mentioned in the a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.combdocumentdbarchive20141031editandquerydocumentsthroughtheazureportal.aspx relnofollowAzure bloga and in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma2670187718356severala a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq3066798718356relateda a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma2778561118356questionsa that the generated IDs are GUIDs.

In our DocumentDB database, we have documents with the third grouping codedde5code, code627acode, codefe95code, and so on. These documents were stored from within a stored procedure by calling codeCollection.createDocumentcode with the options codedisableAutomaticIdGeneration falsecode. Other documents that I create through the third party a hrefhttpsgithub.commingaliuDocumentDBStudio relnofollowDocumentDB Studioa application always have code4xxxcode in the third grouping, which is a valid UUID version. However, documents that I create through the preview portal have nonstandard third groupings like codeb359code.p  pAre the autogenerated DocumentDB IDs supposed to be GUIDs or UUIDs, and is there actually a difference If UUIDs, then which variantp

The purpose is to create a simple codeintcode array with at least 25 elements and use a loop to traverse it and add up all the elements.  I had some issues but looks like I got it to work.

Negative 6262 pSo, for whatever reason, I am trying to create a slider, where the contents of each slide are different HTML templates.

Inside the controller, I would like to have an array of slide template URLs and a corresponding variable to indicate the current slidep  precodeslideUrl  [ viewsslidesslide1.html, viewsslidesslide2.html] slideNum  0 codepre  pIdeally, I would then like my directive to use these variables to determine what variable it will use for codetemplateUrlcode. So by default, you can see that codeslideNumcode is 0, meaning that I want to use codeslide1.htmlcode or codeslideUrl[0]code. So, my codetemplateUrlcode would be something like codeslideUrl[slideNum]code. Of course, this cant be done as the directive wouldnt be able to access that data, so Im not sure how to do this.p  pThe end result would be that if you clicked one of the slide navigation icons, you would be updating the codeslideNumcode variable, which would instantly change the codetemplateUrlcode used. p  pemI guess I am essentially wanting a slider which doesnt rely on some images or something like that for content, but instead is a slider of actual HTML content.emp  pAny ideas If I havent explained myself well enough, please let me know. p

Do I need to use codesystemclockcode here What is the difference between codesteadyclockcode vs codesystemclockcode in layman terms. I am running this code on Ubuntu 14.04 box.p

Negative 6262 pFor the past month or two, I have been tearing my hair out with this. I need to print multiple copies of a PDF file in Java. I have tried multiple libraries, including Apache PDFBox, IcePDF and others, I have tried many codes I have been able to find, but the result is always the same, both on Windows and Linux, only one copy of PDF is printed, be it to PDF or to a regular printer. I have also tried a number of printers, even one that was enterprise grade, so that I was able to rule out the incompatibility of my printers. Has anyone ever encountered this problem I would like to use system calls to programs like Adobe ReaderFoxit Reader as a last resort. Thank you for all your help p  p What I need is a way to print multiple copies in one print job, not in a loop creating multiple print jobs, sorry that it was unclear from the original post.p
Negative 6262 pI have three Combo boxes.I am fetching value of each combobox from the database and each combobox is dependent on the other.

Negative 6262 pI have written a Laravel task which reads data from db, calls a shell script to process data, and that saves results to db. Tasks are queued very fast, and multiple tasks always exist in the queue. I noticed that tasks are not performed one by one, but instead couple of tasks are executed simultaneously. This is good principle, generally speaking, but it seems that shell script I callwhich is btw thirdparty and I cannot modify it is not threadsafe and it creates problems when called simultaneously by multiple tasks. When I am executing task function synchronously, as part of my main process, everything works smooth.p  pWhat I would like to know is if it is possible to tell Laravel queue process one task at a time, because I still want to split this job from my main processing, but also have to avoid these errors. I am on Laravel 5, using default sync queue method.p

Negative 6262 pIts my first questionpost p  pstrongBackground to questionstrongp  pI have an ongoing project which is an Azure hosted ASP.NET solution. Its a generic ERP and is intended for small enterprise businesses. An additional requirement came up and Id like it to be part of the Azure solution previous attempt to create a VSTO addin went bad.p  pstrongIve been asked to automate this processstrong Users spend a long time daily basis manually saving emails into network shared directories according to what company project the emails relate to. E.g. everytime Sally sends or receives an email, she copies and renames the .msg file from outlook into her G drive which is just a network share on the enterprise LAN. Someone else in the enterprise has the job of creating a specific directory structure for sally and her coworkers to save the emails in e.g. CorrespondanceIn, CorrespondanceOut etc... Staff need to be able to search the directories for messages based on some scraped meta data.p  pIm considering an exchange web service managed API application in Azure which has a service that polls the Exchange Server for every user with a pull subscription to identify newchanged mails. Each identified mail will be then assessed against a rule that the user has pre registered in my application i.e. from person x with project ID in the subject field. The application will then rename the email and put it in the network share also scrape metadata to provide search functionality.p  pstrongQuestionstrongp  pa How do I get my remote application to request the Exchange Server or CAS to export the MailItem to a local network share using exchange web services in the most efficient way Preferably without having to deploy something into the enterprise.p  pb is this a ridiculous solutionp  pstrongAdditional Infostrongp  pI expect the typical environment to be quite old. However, I can assume Exchange Server 2007 and Outlook Clients 2007 on Win7 no Office365 though and no sharepoint. I decided to use a pull subscription as it will be a loosely coupled environment and therefore assumed streaming to be not the best fit.p  pMailItems are likely to contain large attachments CAD drawings etc so for obvious reasons, I would like to avoid pulling these across the WAN.p  pI have investigated the potential to create server side mailbox rules with EWS therefore allowing this exchange server to manage the export  however if I understand correctly, rules dont support exporting MailItems to the filesystem.p

Negative 6262 pIm using LunaSolCal widgets, used to inform of sunmoon riseset.

Negative 6262 pI have two tables A and B. A contains order transactions placed on ecommerce websites. B contains orders fulfilled. Unfortunately, they dont share a key on which I can match. So I have to match between the two tables based on similar transactions.

I want to find out how many entries in A are missing from B.p  pThe join tells me how many items i.e. records in A can be found in B but this will not be 100 accurate as a record in B might exist only due to 1 record in A.p  pSo the join can tell me that for any record at least 1 similar record exists in B, and counting records in A for which there is a similar entry in B will mean overstating the figure. The mapping between A and B is many to many.p  pI want to create a join where a row in B is matched only once to a row in A dont care which one. And once it is joined to a row in A, it cannot be used again to join with another row even if the criteria matches. In effect, I want to create a 1 to 1 mapping. This would tell me how many entries in A cannot be found in B but with greater accuracy.p  pExample  If 1st, 2nd and 3rd rows in A, all of them, inner join successfully with first 2 rows of B. The output should be 1st Row inner joins with 1 row, the 2nd row inner joins with 1 row. And 3rd Row inner joins with nothing.p  pPlease bear in mind, I have thousands and millions of rows in each table. So the code has to be optimized.p  pHow is this possible p
