Positive 8596 pHello Ive been having a problem with the jQuery on my site. Currently the site runs on version 2.1.4, but I would like to add a ShoutBox that uses an older version of jQuery. I know it may be a little counterproductive to use two different libraries, but I cannot think of another way. This shoutbox works well for what we need such as spam protection, admin features, no required login or database usage, fast and very minimum amount of files. If you have any suggestions for a new chatbox that works with a newer version, thatd be great. If not, I would like to find a solution that will allow me to use this shoutbox. I have tried the jQuery.noconflict solution, but it doesnt seem to work for me.p  pI have also tried to load the migrate jQuery plugin, which makes it all work, just one small problem. The shoutbox works great except that the scroll bar doesnt identify when a new message is sent and it never scrolls to the very bottom of the chat page. It essentialy just stays at the top and keeps getting smaller when new messages populate the body. p  pBelow is the part of the shoutbox script where the auto scrolling takes place. Thank youp  precodefunction animateMsgsmsgsbox          msgsbox.animate             scrollTop  msgsbox.attrscrollHeight         , 500          function refreshShoutsopts, type          var msgsbox  ShoutCloudMsgBox         var shoutMsg  div.shoutmsg         var lastShout  shoutMsg.filterlast.attrid         if type  admin              lastShout  1                  if type  refresh              type  ajax             lastShout  1             div.shoutmsg[idshoutid0].eachfunction                   this.fadeOutfast                               removeShouts         .postopts.shoutcloudFile,              sccom  type,             last  lastShout         , function data              if data ampamp data.msgs                  if type  admin                      msgsbox.empty                                  msgsbox.appenddata.msgs                 removeShouts                 if shoutMsg.size gt 50                      var diff  shoutMsg.size  50                     var i  0                     while diff gt i                          shoutMsg.first.remove                         i                                                       div.shoutmsgodd, msgsbox.addClassshouteven                 msgsbox.animate                     scrollTop  msgsbox.attrscrollHeight                 , 500                      , json          function removeShouts          var seen           div.shoutmsg.eachfunction               var post  this.attrid             if seen[post]                  this.fadeOutfast                 div.shoutmsgodd, msgsbox.addClassshouteven              else                  seen[post]  true                                function shoutErrorerr          ShoutCloudError.htmlltstronggtErrorltstronggt  err.stop.slideDownfast.delay4000.slideUpfast      jQuery codepre

Positive 8596 pI look at many projects on Github to learn through the examples, but one thing that confuses me is when you have a package that is multiple directories deep and has webpack.config.js files in multiple levels of the directory tree.p  pFrom my understanding webpack is bundling up all the js code and making it watchable. I dont understand how multiple bundlings would work out.p  pFor example a hrefhttpsgithub.comojamereactscrollbars relnofollowhttpsgithub.comojamereactscrollbarsap  pOn the top level you have a package.json and a webpack.config.jsSo I think oh this is where I run npm install and then webpackp  pBut I want to see the examples in the examples directory and there is another webpack.config.js, which is confusing to my webpack newbie brain.p  pWhats up with this Where do I do my bundling to check out this resource Maybe using the example above would illustrate the solution well.p

What I want is on running above code the scrollbar should follow right synchronizing from first word i.e. codeAellcode to last word which is codeZellcode by order given in both lists. p  pThe approach in my mind is to always scroll both lists with respect to length of shortest list left side one in my case so that I can at least match all possible points.  p  pLastly, I am only facing this error when I am dragging slider up and down for scrolling. But when I am simply momentarily pressing and releasing the up and down arrows on scrollbar then everything works fine. p  pstrongWhat I triedstrong p  pApart from reading online, I also tried introducing events and bindings in following manner hoping to restrict the scrolling step wise, but no change.p  precodeself.lb1.bindltUpgt, lambda event self.scrolllistboxes1 self.lb2.bindltUpgt, lambda event self.scrolllistboxes1 self.lb1.bindltDowngt, lambda event self.scrolllistboxes1 self.lb2.bindltDowngt, lambda event self.scrolllistboxes1  def scrolllistboxesself, yFactor function runs when a listbox has focus and the Up or Down arrow  keys are pressed     self.listbox1.yviewscrollyFactor, units     self.listbox2.yviewscrollyFactor, units codepre  pstrongP.S.strongp  pI just thought upon something, but really not sure if thats all the way correct. Since the lengths are unmatched, scrolling action varies for both list boxes. So is it possible to somehow force the scrolling action of shortest list on another list This way another list with more contents wont be able to move freely and will have to follow scrolling pattern just as shortest content list box.p

Positive 8596 pI would like to know, if there is a common desision for issue described below.p  pLets consider the situation I have a form with some controls, which captions and fonts could be changed on loading. I want controls to be resized when form is resizing. Also I want controls captions to be clearly visible, if it possible. If it not, I want form to have scrollbar.p  pI thought I could use control constraints and anchors to resolve the situation. But if i use anchors scrollbar wont be shown. Also I have to calculate constraints because i dont know controls fonts and captions at design mode.p  pSo Im looking for some component or wellknown algorithm which could help me to resolve the issue.p
Positive 8596 pI have a problem with chrome scrollbar,on Mozilla there is no such a problem. I have couple of synchronous ajax requests and then some info appending on the page,they need about 2 secs to load.During this time the scrollbar freezes and is not usable,when the ajax end the scroll works fine.p

Negative 8596 pI feel that while I love J2ME and Java its hypocritical of them to have two APIs for Java. Java was designed with One code, many platforms in mind, and now its more like One API for every OS, and one API for everything smaller than a netbook. I see a lot of J2ME emulators and such being ported to things like the PSP, and other consoles for homebrew, and I wonder why no one is doing this with normal Java. p  pId love to write a game to play on my PC, than fire up a simple emulator and play the same game on the PSP, or the Dreamcast, but I cant. J2ME cant even run on a PC, you need an emulator for it, which reduces your market greatly. Plus most emulators are bulky, and not good.p  pWith superphones like the IPhone coming out people are going to want more than little J2ME games, so if Java cant port their standard JRE to it they might find themselves missing the boat like Microsoft did with the netbook boom.p  pIt just feels like Sun needs to ether work on making the standard JRE smaller and more portable, or making J2ME available on the PC easily.p

The only way Ive though about it even being possible is rendering to textures, and them adding window decoration around those...p  pI want to expose the workings to other programmers, but which way would be best. I am more of a C programmer and so inheritance was the first way I thought of. Make basic classes which I expose in a shared header file, the programmer then derives their own window object from that, overriding the Init or Run methods to implement what they need. The problem with this approach would be keeping the programmers in check, there would be no real way to keep them from simply drawing wherever they want in the OpenGL screen.p  pAnother possible way would be functors, passing the functors the programmer wants to use into the library which then calls it once its finished rendering its GUI components and whatnot.p  pWhat is the best way of approaching any of thisp

Negative 8596 pFor my current project I want to integrate a maven plugin for database migrations. For this plugin to work, however, I have to obtain the database settings inside my POM. My database settings are currently placed inside a hibernate.properties file, positioned in a directory that is marked as maven resource. For a variety of reasons I do not want to duplicate my database configurations in both the pom and hibernate.properties.p  pIm aware that maven offers a filtering ability which makes it possible to specify the database settings as property inside my POM, and reference them inside my codehibernate.propertiescode as codepropertynamecode. But as Im using multiple maven profiles, with different property resources, this is not a suitable solution. Instead Id like my database configurations to be loaded from a property file inside my classpath e.g. codeclasspathhibernate.propertiescode, and use these properties in my migration plugin configuration.p  pI have already tried the org.codehaus.mojo  propertiesmavenplugin, but this plugin only accepts absolute locations. Is there a plugin which can scan all my maven resources for a certain propertyp

Negative 8596 pInstinctively, I would say that this is impossible, as NHibernate needs to know some mapping information on how to persist a given type. Thus, I encountered some situations in which I could use such a feature. For instance, through a named query or something like so. On the other hand, using a named query would require me to make an addition to the configuration file.p  pLets suppose we have an application interacting with some underlying datastore. This datastore is configured through the NHibernate configuration file. Then, I wish to have NHibernate load only a subset of an entity properties, from another subsystem to which my application shouldnt need to interact much, so it is not worthy to define classes for this system, as I only need a fraction of this alien systems information, lets say three out of thirtytwo data columns. For that matter, if I chose to load only those three columns lets say for performance concerns, I would then use an anonymous type, perform the required action onto this information, then persist it back to the datastore. Now, it wouldnt be of much interest to do so if I only had one entity to get loaded from the datastore, so lets say I have about 75,000 rows to load into my process. I then shall consider this subset option very seriouslyp  pWhat strategy should you choose in such situation, if you needed to persist these changes to a subset only of this entitys propertiesp  pFYI I am asking because I must write specific rules of usage with NHibernate, such rules that even a beginner developer would even be able to use it without knowing too much about NHibernate, but only following the rules and guidance of the technical documents I have to produce.p  pThanks in advance for any comments and answers.p

Am I going beyond what is possible by trying to combine OneToOne with Id And if so, how could one model this relationship sensiblyp

Negative 8596 pJava Class a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase8docsapijavalangreflectArray.html relnofollowjava.lang.reflect.Arraya provides a set of tools for creating an array dynamically.  However in addition to that it has a whole set of methods for accessing get, set, and length an array.  I dont understand the point of this, since you can and presumably would cast your dynamically generated array as an array upon creation, which means you can use the normal array access bracket notation functionality.  In fact, looking at the source code you can see that is all the class does, cast the array, and throw an exception if the cast fails.p  pSo whats the point  usefulness of all of these extra methodsp  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pAll of the primitive codegetcode and codesetcode methods seem emespeciallyem unhelpful, considering you need to know the type of the array beforehand in order to know which method to use.p  pstrongUpdate 2strongp  pThanks everyone, your input has been very educational  I cant really see when emIdem be using this class for anything other than codenewInstancecode and maybe codegetLengthcode, but I now realize these other methods are still quite useful.p

Negative 8596 pIve implemented a web based instant messaging  chat feature using http binding and ejabberd. For the lazy heres the short version of my questionp  pHow would you go about implementing a web based XMPP chat client which could be displayed in multiple browser windows simultaneously, each displaying an identical view of the open chatsp  pMore detailed ramblings for those who carep  pOne potential solution would be to just let every tab manage its own connection. XMPP has decent enough support for multiple clients so let it do the routing. I have at least 2 issues with this solution. 1 is the obvious increase in bandwidth consumption this would cause. 2 is the current lack of support for multiple clients with the same JID to connect to MUC rooms in ejabberd. This will apparently be implemented for 3.1 but its a major issue for me as it stands.p  pInitially I wondered if there might be some flash magic involved but it seems the swf on the page is only used to play the notification sound effects. You can confirm this by using firebug or similar to delete the embed tag. The chat feature still works.p  pThis basically leaves me with cookies as the only way to share between the tabs. In this scenario a master tab would dump all messages to cookies which could be polled from other tabs. This seems quite ridiculous to me as the poll frequency would have to be exceptionally high to avoid any latency. What would happen when the master window was closedp  pIve seen this done by more than one site and normally when I look at problems like these I can at least understand at least vaguely how Id go about it but I dont mind admitting this one has got me stumped. p

Negative 8596 pIm working on a web app for a magazine that will allow users to log in and renew their subscriptions online. These subscriptions are renewed based on a set of rules, and Id like to get some ideasrecommendations on how to set up these rules.p  pThis web app interfaces with an external thirdparty system that has data for the subscriber. When the subscriber logs in, the web app grabs a bunch of information from this thirdparty system, including a number called a subscription definition ID which ostensibly denotes the type of subscription that a subscriber has. This subscription type may be several years out of date, so the web app contains a set of order specifications stored in a database that consists of the current subscribe options, along with information like the current rate so the price can be shown to the user on the order form.p  pMy current idea is to create a table of subscription definition IDs that map to the order specification to which a given subscription definition ID renews. For example, a subscription definition ID might denote a 1year subscription from ten years ago, which cost 39.99 back then in the database, this would map to the emcurrentem order specification, which would have the current price of 59.99.p  pThis works pretty well in theory, but as usual, theres a catch. When the subscription definition IDs were set up back in the day, they werent always unique. In particular, one subscription definition ID has wildly different behaviors, depending on context. This subscription definition ID is used for both 1year subscriptions and 1year discounted gift subscriptions. Therefore, given this subscription definition ID, a number of things can happenp  ol liIf its a 1year subscription, hell renew using the current 1year subscription.li liIf its a 1year discounted gift subscription and the subscriber is not renewing any other subscriptions, itll renew as a current 1year fullprice gift subscription.li liIf its a 1year discounted gift subscription and the subscriber is renewing other subscriptions, itll renew as a current 1year discounted gift subscription.li ol  pIm not sure how to generalize this in the database, especially since this complication only occurs with emoneem record. I basically need a way to model that above logic which could also work with the records that emarentem special cases. I could always do this in code, but Im reluctant to put all this businessy logic in the code itself especially in case the problem occurs in the future, with other subscription definition IDs.p  pWhats the best way to model this combination of data and logical rulesp

Negative 8596 pSo, I am using a hrefhttpwww.mattephraim.comblog20090708introducingghostscriptsharpMatthew Ephraims GhostscriptSharpa, which is a simple C wrapper for the unmanaged Win32 Ghostscript DLL in my ASP.Net MVC project.  Some backgroundp  pWhat I am attempting to do is have a user upload a PDF, and then convert that document into an image that I can then save off into whatever directory I choose as well as do some other OOP to tie that new image to my site.p  pI decided to use Mr. Ephraims wrapper class GhostscriptSharp because it was simple enough to use, and it gives me relatively clean access to the DLLs API.  p  pTo test it, I created a dummy C console application to make sure I could load the DLL, access it, hand it a PDF file on the local disk and then have it write a JPG to the same local disk.  After a few learning experiences, I had success.  I would hand it CINPUT.pdf, it would hand me COUTPUT.jpg. p  pHowever, after integrating the GhostScriptSharp code that I had in the console application into my ASP.NET MVC project to the point of where I was calling the DLL with Pinvoke, Ghostscript is returning with the interror code code100code, which is a fatal error is called codeEFatalcode in the GhostScript source code.  I get the same result with both the file that is uploaded through the HTML form, and if I hand it the exact same hardcoded paths that I used in my working console application.p  pFor reference, the lines which the exception is thrown are 9397 in GhostScriptSharp.cs which is in the codeCallApicode functionp  precodeint result  InitAPIgsInstancePtr, args.Length, args  if result lt 0    throw new ExternalExceptionGhostscript conversion error, result  codepre  pObviously the exception is thrown because coderesultcode is code100code.p  pWhen InitAPI is called, the instance ptr is a valid codeintcode though I dont know if the instance of GS is correct or not, args has a length of 20 is a codestring[]code of valid GhostScript options including the correctlyescaped paths to my input amp output files.p  pLong story short, what am I doing wrong  The error code code100code seems like a catchall because there is no documentation that states what could possibly be going wrong here.p  pAny help is much appreciated, thank you in advance.p

The number of files and examples for each spec type isp  precodemodels      25 files, 391 examples controllers 26 files, 973 examples views       52 files, 508 examples codepre  pUsing just rake spec did work on Ruby 1.8.7p302 and Ruby 1.9.1p243.p  pDoes anyone have any ideas I can run each group individually and even create an alias to do it all at once, but then rspec has to spin up the app 3 times. Besides, that doesnt address why this isnt working on ruby 1.9.2. p

Negative 8596 pIve written a test using webdrive like this  p  precodeput stuff in the database fillDatabaseWithParticipants  WebDriver driver  new FirefoxDriver doLogindriver  finds the search button and clicks it WebElement searchButton  driver.findElementBy.xpathhtmlbodydivdiv[8]div[2]formtabletbodytr[5]tdbutton searchButton.click  clicks the first column of a Primefaces dataTable component to order the content in ascending order driver.findElementBy.xpathhtmlbodydivdiv[8]div[2]formdivdivtabletheadtrth.click   gets the first table division of the first table row WebElement firstTableDivision  driver.findElementBy.xpathhtmlbodydivdiv[8]div[2]formdivdivtabletbodytrtd  Assert.assertEqualsShould be the same name, A name inserted by me in the database, firstTableDivision.getText codepre  pWhat the test does is it opens a Firefox browser, goes to the site and logs in. Then it clicks on the search button of the page and waits for the datatable to appear. When the datatable appears with the results, the test clicks on the first column to order it in ascending order. Then it does the codeassertEqualscode to see if the first name is indeed the first name one that I inserted in the database in the beginning of the test.p  pThe problem I have is that this test only works if I run it on debug mode. If I run it with the Run As... jUnit test in Eclipse the return of codefirstTableDivision.getTextcode is the first content the table division had when it was first rendered.p  pI tried using an codeExpectedConditioncode like sop  precodeExpectedCondition e  new ExpectedConditionltBooleangt            public Boolean applyWebDriver d              WebElement changingElement  d.findElementBy.xpathhtmlbodydivdiv[8]div[2]formdivdivtabletbodytrtd             System.out.printlnchangingElement.getText             ifchangingElement.getText.equalsIgnoreCaseA Name inserted by me                 return true              else                  return false                                       org.openqa.selenium.support.ui.WaitltWebDrivergt w  new WebDriverWaitdriver, 15     w.untile codepre  pand also tried codedriver.manage.timeouts.implicitlyWaitnew Long15, TimeUnit.SECONDScode.p  pThe expected condition I wrote up there is awful, I know, but it was only to see if it would work.

Negative 8596 pI work with WCF 4.0 and have a good idea of how to build services from a technical standpoint. I have been working now with WCF for 3 years now.p  pDespite this I and others I talk to have different ideas about what should be the unit of software that makes up a service and what should not. Many people I talk to believe that services should be granular. Indeed my previous company has spent alot of time turning some of their Assemblys into Services so I have been told.p  pIn many instances I cant see how a service is better...and maybe its not always supposed to be. Ill give you an example In our system we have a large service that really has grown to perform two different independant jobs. I am going to split it into two services for two reasons performance and fault isolation we self host in a Windows Service, no IIS. The thing is, despite serving two independant business processes one service can be down without affecting the other, both have a fair chunk of common business logic.p  pNow some advise me that this common logic should be seperated into a 3rd service under SOA principals and be consumed by the two newly split services. As I see it, this just partially undoes the benefit of spliting the big service in the first place we have introduced a performance bottleneck and single point of failure. If the host process of the 3rd service goes down, 1 and 2 can no longer do their work. This happens to us now where we have a deep structure of many services. One goes out and any dependant services up the chain timeout as their calls are never answered.p  pNow if the common logic was just a library rather than a service we get the benefit of code reuse, no performance bottleneck and fault isolation as each service is executing its own copy of the assembly in its own memory. Also there is no serialisation overhead.p  pWhat are peoples thoughts on this Is there a rule or general guideline when it comes to deciding when something should be a service or a library Any other advicep  pThanks Michaelp

Negative 8596 pI am working with a map view populated with custom pins.  When the user taps somewhere on the map to deselect a pin, I want to implement the map such that the pin does not become deselected i.e. users are not able to deselect pins without selecting other pins, so at least one pin will always be selected.  Here is my implementation of the didDeselectAnnotationView methodp  precodevoidmapViewMKMapView mapView didDeselectAnnotationViewMKAnnotationView view      [mapView selectAnnotationview.annotation animatedNO]  codepre  pEssentially, Im trying to reselect the annotation.  However, after some debugging and printing to console, I realized that the annotation view isnt actually being deselected until after the method didDeselectAnnotationView finishes running that is, the order of events goes user taps somewhere on map, didDeselectAnnotationView is called and finishes executing, the annotation view is actually deselected.  Has anyone else experienced this problem, or does anyone know another way to enforce the behavior for the map such that users are unable to deselect pins without selecting other pins, so that one pin will always be selectedp  pThanks for the help.p

Negative 8596 pI am using XDebug as a profiler for a PHP application. I have run into a situation where XDebug changes severely the results in such a degree that they are useless.p  pHere a simplified example to demonstrate the problemp  precodefunction foo x  1  function bar foo  codepre  pTest Ap  precodet0  microtimetrue for i  0 i lt 1000000 i foo echo microtimetrue  t0 codepre  pTest Bp  precodet0  microtimetrue for i  0 i lt 1000000 i bar echo microtimetrue  t0 codepre  pSo, these are the results I am getting in secondsp  precode          profiler   profiler  gt profiler           disabled   enabled   gt results                      output     output    gt total time   time in foo   time in bar Test A    0.159      12.199    gt 12.245       0.110            not called Test B    0.233      25.399    gt 25.578       0.104           11.068 codepre  pThe increased execution time is expected because of the extra calls to the profiler. The slight variation between the microtimebased output and the profiler results is also expected. I have repeated the tests several times, and the results are always similar.p  pFrom the results taken from Test B with the profiler disabled, we can say that the script spends about 0.159 seconds in foo and 0.074 seconds in bar. It is evident that time spent in bar is less than the time spent in foo.p  pHowever, when I analyze the results of the profiler with qcachegrind, the time emshownem as spent in bar  11.068 seconds is ridiculously higher than the time in foo 0.104 seconds. There is a possible explanation for this each time a function call is made, the profiler runs some extra code to keep track of the time spent in the call. I believed that it excluded this extra time from the results, but apparently it does not.p  pstrong[EDIT]strong As a result, the profiler says that bar takes more time than foo in this program, which is not the case as we have measured with the profiler disabled. Its not even close The relative results the percentage of time taken by each function are totally wrong. This should not be expected, because, if this is the case, the profiler can not indicate which function takes most of the time. Although the absolute times are expected to have big differences, the relative times should not have. strong[EDIT]strongp  pThis renders the results unusable. Any code that is more modular with more function calls, wrappers, objects etc. is severely penalized, although it is not emthatem slowerp  pSo the question is Is there any way to tell XDebug to strongignorestrong or strongtrack separatelystrong the extra time spent for the profiler callsp

Negative 8596 pIm looking to see whether or not the following is even possible, as all preliminary searches havent turned back anything to indicate either way.p  pId like to use Hibernates Validator annotations to validate bean methods, and I would like to use emsomeem AOP framework Spring, AOP Alliance, AspectJ, etc. to intercept methods annotated with a subset of the Hibernate Validator annotations codeNotNullcode, codeNotEmptycode, codeEmailcode, etc. I then want AOP advice to run when they are encountered.p  pIs this possible to do If so, I am having a tough time visualizing how the code would work.

Negative 8596 pMy current project has a need for a one way messaging system and I am looking for any thoughts or resources on database design and security considerations. Everything Ive found so far deals with a facebook like system with two users logged in. This system will have only one logged in user who will send out messages to any email address they wish. The recipient of that address will have a link to click that will take them to a specific chat thread to respond to the originators questions. The originator will have an inbox to track all of their threads. The recipient will only go to the thread once to answer the question and never return. They dont need to reference chat thread ever again. Has anyone worked on something like this before that can point me in the right direction or know of any resources tutorials as I get started on this My initial thoughts arep  p1.Email goes out with link. Name and email stored in database table. 2.Send recipient name in link to be grabbed as GET so we can identify them in chat thread 3.A jquery screen that lists questions and responses in order from database table. 4.Upon response being submitted originator gets email that response is made and when they login to their dashboard they have a simple jquery inbox that lists latest response and subject where they can respond which is basically starting process all over again with another email going out with link back to thread.p  pDatabase designed with tables similar to normal messagingp  precodeCREATE  TABLE message    msgid    msgtext    msgdate    PRIMARY KEY msgid   CREATE  TABLE messagechain    msgcid    msgctopic    PRIMARY KEY msgcid   CREATE  TABLE messagestatus    msgstamsgid    msgstausrid   msgstamsgcid    msgstaissender   msgstaisread    msgstaisdeleted   PRIMARY KEY msgstamsgid, msgstausrid codepre  pAny thoughtsideasresourcesexperience are helpful as I havent been able to find anything on this type of system and it terrifies me that it is completely open on one end. p

Negative 8596 pI need my parent classes to be able to access methods within the child classes. Child classes are obviously able to access their inherited parent class methods.p  pBut what if child A wants to borrow a toy that belongs to child B Child A will ask the parent if its okay to borrow that toy from child B. The parent tells child A that they will grab it from child Bs room and give it to child A to play with.p  pI have also created this scenario below to help illustrate what I am needing here. Not really sure how to go about doing this.p  p[STORY]p  pLets say you have purchased a new House. You want certain areas of your hours repainted. Oh, and by the way, you need your plumbing looked at.p  pSo we have a Person, House, Painter, amp Plumber.p  pThe Person will find the problem areas in the House, and write them down. The Person will then need to find a Plumber and a Painter and call them, reporting their issues.p  pThe Plumber and Painter will then show up to the House with their specialized tools and equipment to carry on with their job.p  pThe strongHousestrong will have have these areasp  ol liToilet li liSinkli liShowerli liExterior Sidingli lipInterior Wallsp  ul liThe Plumber will need access to the Toilet, Sink, and Shower.li liThe Painter will need access to the Exterior Siding and Interior Walls.li ulli ol  pSo the Plumber and Painter have arrived at the house to begin doing what they do best.p  pFirstly, the plumber will need to perform his job inside, so the Painter will begin with painting the Exterior Siding and move to the interior walls, once the Plumber is done.p  pThe Plumber has finished his job. The Plumber reports back to the Person to let them know the job is complete. p  pThe Person then tells the Painter that the Plumber has finished, and that the Painter can begin painting the Interior Walls when the Painter is ready.p  pWhich class structure would be best in this scenario I read up on a couple patterns that have grabbed my interest.p  pCommand Pattern amp Object Pooling.p  pIm thinking Object Pooling is more of the route to take. Any input herep  pAlso, if I did take the Object Pooling route, would it be better to instantiate each class within the constructor and have it ready to be used for later OR should I instantiate each class only when I need to used it probably done via some run or execute method.p  pExamples would be appreciated.p  pAlso, I would prefer not using static callsp

Negative 8596 pIm using JDO and the google datastore in my appengine java app, all working fine.p  pWhen I add a new attribute to a PersistanceCapable Class and deploy it, the old already persisted Entities are not shown anymore. I do not really unterstand whats happening. Has someone theoretical background to share on this subject  If you replace a Class with a new version of the same one serialUID field staying the same, compile and deploy it, you should also be able to loop in the existing old version Entities and update them with the missing information, so that they will stay available to the application  How to achieve this  I have no idea.p  pE.G. I habe about 35 Location Entities Location.class. I update Location.class to provide a new Persistent attribute Long LocationExternalID along with its gettersetters. I also change my App code to use this field. How to loop in all the old Entities to add this new Attribute and set its value It looks like testing if the attribute is available before deserialization p  pI cannot delete and recreate the old Entities, because of theyr Keys being referenced in unowned relationships. Too much work to do so.p  pNot shown means via the query, wich fetches all elements at app loading to display in a dropdown. Then when I add a new one via tha app, it appears in the drop down and behaves as expected. All elements including the old ones are visible in the datastore viewer.p

Negative 8596 pIm completely new to Ruby on Rails, have never worked on it, but I am supposed to take over somebody elses old project. He designed a webapp that logs into a websiteserver online, extracts data from it daily and performs calculations. However, the application has not been running for quite some time, so now when it tries to display statistics, the page crashes. It uses data from a 5 week period and currently only has data for 2 days.p  pI need to manually insert data for the missing weeks in order to get it up and running again, but the problem is I dont know how to findaccess its database, nor how exactly to use Ruby on Rails. I found several files in the db directory of his project, however they were mostly .sqlite33 files or just files. I downloaded sqlite precompiled binary for Windows and tried to use it, but not sure what to do. I also downloaded and tried using SQTView to open the files to change the tables, but I have had no luck.p  pHow can I tell which file is the main database and how do I edit it And what are .sqlite33 files Thanks.p  pemEDITem The application produces a  TypeError in HomeControllerindex nil cant be coerced into Floatp  pIt links the error to a line in the code, but the only reason the error happens is because there is no data in the table for the time period that the variable in this line of code tries to use. That is why I want to manually update it with values.p  pI think that Sqliteman might do the trick and thankyou for explaining all of this to me. I just have to confirm it works after editing.p  pemEDIT2em Okay, so I had a small revelation while experimenting on his app. It turned out that the page crashed because of empty values for full weeks. If I used the app to gather data for at least one day per week up until this week, then the app worked.p  pIs there a way I can populate all the missing days without having to manually click the days in its calendar because it takes a good 2030 seconds for it to loadp  pThank you very much for your help.p

Negative 8596 pthis is my first question or rather Questions. I am in my last semester this college and Reading PDF is one of the components that im developing for my thesis.p  pI have been reading questions about reading a pdf document but there are no solid answer. I want to know strongwhat are the ways to read a PDF documentstrong what i have read that there are APIs available that can read PDF Document like PDFBox, a hrefhttpwww.mupdf.com relnofollowmuPDFa, and a hrefhttpitextpdf.com relnofollowiTexta. I have not seen any other APIs but this is what i have read on other posts.p  pThe problem here is first strongPDFBoxstrong i read that PDFBox can not be use because of AWT Dependencies and android is has no AWT and Swing related classes. PDFBox is out of the question. strongmuPDFstrong i have not read anything about muPDF, it was recommended to me but i want to know if it is usable to read PDF Document. strongiTextstrong this is the most common API that i encounter in PDF and android related questions. the problem here is its strongLicensestrongCorrect me if im wrong I have not tried any of this 3 yet because i want know if there are another solutions beside this 3.p  pOther than APIs, i think strongPDF Reader Applicationsstrong can be used too if im not mistaken if it can be used then strongHOWstrong. Im not looking for a Code but a explanation of how you did it and how you implemented it in your application.p  pi have thought another way but i do not know if this is possible. how about convert PDF Document into a .txt or .doc file inside the android. it would be like when i load a PDF document inside the android a Code will convert that PDF Document into a .txt  .doc file and the application will search and extract text from the .txt  .doc file rather then the PDF Document.p  pif you are asking WHY do i need this kind of component, because im working on a application that would strongSEARCHstrong and strongEXTRACTstrong text from a PDF Document using Android.p  pThis is my questionsp  ol liWhat are the ways to read a PDF Document in Androidli liWhat are your experiences in using this kind of methodli liHow did you do it using this kind of methodjust a flowexplanation would doli liIf the method has a License what would be the problem in the futureli ol  pPS Correct me if im wrong.p  pThank you.p

Negative 8596 pIm trying to integrate twitter to my mobile web app using only javascript, html5, and css.  My app only has one url and we use wink to handle page navigation.  The problem is whenever we goes out and come back or even open a new url in the same window and back to our mobile web app, the app got reload, and we dont want that to happen when we make a tweet.p  pSo, for facebook, we include its own JavaScript SDK, and used FB.ui to handle share.  p  precodeFB.ui         method feed,         name name,         caption caption,         description desc,         link link,         picture pic     ,     function response          console.logresponse , response      codepre  pWhen we call that function, a popup will appear in the screen with close button.  And when we close the fb popup, nothing happened to our main app.  It also handles different behavior between iPhone and iPad.p  pSo I want to do the same thing with twitter, to be able to tweet, retweet, follow, and favorite a tweet. First, I was using the twitter button, which always goes out to our main url and create a new window when click the button. Then, I tried to open the shared url in an iframe, later i found it is forbidden by twitter. Then, I want to use its API, but the write query like post a tweet would need a backend, which I dont want to have.p  pSo far, Ive tried withp  precodelta idtwitterURL classtwittershare hrefhttpstwitter.comshareurlhttp3A2F2Fwww.myapp.comamptextshareinggtShareltagt lta idtwitterURL classtwittershare hrefhttpmobile.twitter.comhomestatussharinggtShareltagt lta idtwitterURL classtwittershare hrefhttpstwitter.comintenttweetgtShareltagt codepre  pThe closest question i got from stackoverflow is a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5895111twitterconnectfromwebsitewithoutpopupTwitter connect from website without popupa but it is not been answered fully, and the difference between him and mine is hes fine if the user accept, but mine is not since the app will refresh.p  pIm new here, so if someone knows how to narrow down my words to make a simple but efficient question, please let me know as well, thanksp

Negative 8596 pI have searched for suitable answers to my question but I did not find any helpful so far. I want to record the decibel in the environment. If a specific threshold is exceeded the app shall play a sound or song file. Everything works fine so far but I have troubles to keep the app running in the background.  I have already added the attribute Application does not run in the background and set its value to NO. Ive read that one should add the externalaccessory element to the Required background modes. I added that too but still it does not work. I am using the codeAVAudioRecordercode to record the sound and the codeAVPlayercode to play the soundmusic file. First I used the codeMPMediaControllercode codeiPodMusicPlayercode but it throws an exception along with the attribute Required background modes.p  pEDIT I am using xCode 4.5 with iOS 6p  pEDIT 2 When I add the string viop to the Required background modes it seems to continue recording while in background. But it still does not play the music file when being in background. I also tried to add the audio value too but it did not help.p  pEDIT 3 Ive consulted the apples developer reference. It seems like you have to configure your AVAudioSession. With that it seems to work a hrefhttpdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosdocumentationAudioConceptualAudioSessionProgrammingGuideConfigurationConfiguration.htmlapplerefdocuidTP40007875CH3SW422the20link20to20the20relevant20reference22 relnofollowlink to referencea. But now I have troubles in playing more than one file because as soon as the first track has finished playing, the app will go into suspended mode again. As far as I know there is no possibility to initialize the AVPlayer or AVAudioPlayer with more than one file. I used the delegate methode audioPlayerDidFinishPlayingsuccessfully to set the next track but it did not work.p  pEDIT 4 Ok, one possibility is to avoid stopping the recorder, that is removing the [record stop] so that it even records the sound when music is played. It is a work around that works but still I appreciate any other better solution to this.

By searching the documentation of log4j it seems that unlike log4net, log4j does not support the codeOutputDebugStringAppendercode which redirect output to what dbgview listens to.p  pHow can one create a log file that dbgview can parse How can one send string to the debug stream from java Is there any debugview alternative for javap  pI am using eclipse, Windows 7 and latest log4j jar.p
Negative 8596 pI am developing an application, where I need to put two buttons at the bottom regardless of any screen resolution.p  pWhat will be best to implement thisp
Negative 8596 pI have a signal with an unwanted oscillating carrier, shown in the blue curve. I made a low pass filter 5th order butterworth and applied with codefiltfiltcode function, and low the filtered output is the red curve. p  precode[b,a]  butter5,.7 y  filtfiltb,a,y codepre  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comcvcNW.png altenter image description here The red curve from x value 500 to the end is exactly what I wanted, however the initial oscillation is still there. It seems like the filter function tries to match the initialend value of the filter input and output, thus the oscillation preserves. Is there a way to unmatch the initial value so I can get a smooth output without any oscillationp  pUpdate I think my question wasnt clear. I want something like the black curve hand drawing completely remove the oscillation, and do NOT match the initial value. How can I do this img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comR94VH.png altenter image description herep
Negative 8596 pHi I am relatively new to hornetQ. I have written a test package that has an embedded hornet Q server with a producer and an asynchronous consumer. Hopefully I have done the implementation right. Now the issues are as follows p  ol lipWhen I send a messages to the queue via the prodcuer it returns successful but when trying to consume a message from the queue no messages seem to be consumed. Its like the consumer is inactive.pli lipWhen I try to use the setSendAcknowledgementHandler method i get the errorpli ol  pjava.lang.IllegalStateException You cant set confirmationHandler on a connection with confirmationwindowsize lt 0.

Negative 8596 pIm working with about 10 or so NSDecimalNumbers in my app, but Im having trouble finding a way to just allocate them all at once for use by all the various buttons on the storyboard.  The interface of viewcontroller.h wouldve been the logical location, but it wont let me go past NSDecimalNumber one.  What should I dop  pAlso, as I need the values in each object simply altered as I go, as opposed to deleted and recreated, what should I do about memory releasep  pIm still fairly new to programming, so try not to be overly technical.  Thanks in advancep  pKurt Revis  All right, let me try to give an example  In viewcontroller.h, we have 1 outlet and 2 actions, connected to a label and 10 buttons.  We also have the NSDecimalNumbers screen and digit.p  precodeinterface viewcontrollerUIViewController IBOutlet UILabel CalculatorScreen NSDecimalNumber screen NSDecimalNumber digit  IBActionDigitPressedidsender  IBActionOperatorPressedidsender codepre  pWhen DigitPressed is hit, the NSDecimalNumber screen is calculated like so in viewcontroller.mp  precode IBActionDigitPressedidsender      screen [[screen decimalNumberByMultiplyingBy ten] decimalNumberByAddingdigit] codepre  pwhere ten is also an NSDN.  But in order to do that or so I thought, screen has to be allocated like sop  precodescreen[NSDecimalNumber alloc] codepre  pso now we get thisp  precode IBActionDigitPressedidsender      screen[NSDecimalNumber alloc] screen [[screen decimalNumberByMultiplyingBy ten] decimalNumberByAddingdigit] codepre  p but then its allocated to a new address with each hit.  Similarly, if I try to use the number in my OperatorPressed section, it will have to be independently allocated. p  pTherefore, I need a way to allocate the memory once and then just use the number over and over in all methods of my .m file.p

Negative 8596 pI am wondering how to check if my application is open and currently visible to the user when receiving an codeonMessagecode from GCM. At first, I was just using my own codeboolean isVisiblecode, but then I realized this isnt reliable, because if the app isnt open, the object I use to access that flag is codenullcode. While this in itself could be used to see if the app is open, it seems a little bit messy. Is there a way in Android from a system level to somehow check if the application is currently open, and if the user is viewing the app Keep in mind an app could technically be running, but not be visible, because a user has recently pressed the home button sending it to the background.p  precodeOverride protected void onMessageContext arg0, Intent arg1      String turn  intent.getExtras.getStringturn     if turn.equalsyours          if app is open lt what can go here               dont generate a notification               display something in the game instead                    else               generate notification telling player its their turn                 codepre

Negative 8596 pif I make a rightclick in explorer on an executable file and choose properties. then in the properties dialog I select the tab version. Then I click on the productversion. This is the value which I need to get with c.  I tried it with fileversioninfo.productversion, but if I get in the explorer 1.85 the fileversioninfo returns me weird values like 1,00000,8,00. Dots become commas and the last digits are stripped off. I use net 2 on win 7 64 bit, if that matters. fileversioninfo doesnt return what I would expect or what explorer does. I tried also fileversioninfo.fileversion, but it somehow returns even exact the same weird value like the fileversioninfo.productversion. In explorer view there is a clear difference between fileversion and productversion in the original fileproperties dialog window. .Net with its fileversioninfo class doesnt display the values in that way how explorer would. What must I do to get the values of the version in the explorer wayp

Negative 8596 pSo my scenario drilled down to the essence is as follows Essentially, I have a config file containing a set of SQL queries whose result sets need to be exported as CSV files. Since some queries may return billions of rows, and because something may interrupt the process bug, crash, ..., I want to use a framework such as spring batch, which gives me restartabilty and job monitoring. I am using a file based H2 database for persisting spring batch jobs.p  pSo, here are my questionsp  ul lipUpon creating a Job, I need to provide my RowMapper some initial configuration. So what happens when a job needs to be restarted after a e.g. crash Concretlyp  ul liIs the state of the RowMapper automatically persisted, and upon restart Spring batch will try to restore the object from its database, orli liwill the RowMapper object be used that is part of the original spring batch XML config file, orli liI have to maintain the RowMappers state using the stepsjobs ExecutionContextli ulli lipAbove question is related to whether there is magic going on when using the spring batch XML configuration, or whether I could as well create all these beans in a programmatic way Since I need to parse my own config format into a spring batch job config, I rather just use spring batchs Java classes beans and fill them out appropriately, rather attempting to manually write out valid XML. However, if my Job crashes, I would create all the beans myself again. Does spring batch automagically restore the Job state from its databasepli lipIf I really need XML, is there a way to serialize a springbatch JobRepository or one of these objects as a spring batch XML configpli lipRight now, I tried to configure my Step with the following code  but I am unsure if this is the proper way to do thisp  ul liIs TaskletStep the way to goli liIs the way I create the chunked readerwriter correct, or is there some other object which I should use insteadli lipI would have assumed that opening of the reader and writer would occur automatically as part of the JobExecution, but if I dont open these resources prior to running the Job, I get an exception telling me that I need to open them first.

Negative 8596 pI have an app for Android which checks for new notifications from Facebook every N minutes, where N is more than 5 minutes default is 30 minutes. That app also makes some usergenerated requests to Facebooks Graph API. Recently since the moment we added scheduled polling for new notifications, Facebook started to limit our app with error 17 User request limit reached mostly, but sometimes it gives error 4 Application request limit reached. The Insights Dashboard gives us following statistics 255,000 requests per day, 432 users. That gives roughly 590 requests per user per day, which is far from any mentioned limit for API I was able to find.

So if I declare an codeintcode, 32 bits are set aside for numbers, if I declare a char, 8 bits are set aside and the bits for that data type define a letter.p  pRunning with that idea, I did the following basic operation in java which confuses mep  precodeint num  00000010 System.out.printlnnum codepre  pThis prints code8code and if I define codenumcode this wayp  precodeint num  00000100 System.out.printlnnum codepre  pThis prints code64codep  pSo to practice with bitwise operations just for the hell of it I tried thisp  precodeint num  00000010 ltlt 1 System.out.printlnnum codepre  pAnd it prints code16code where as I thought it would shift the bits by one to the left and print code64code.p  pWhat is happening here, and when would I ever need to apply this method of manipulating bitsp

Negative 8596 pI have two sets of 2D points, separated from each other by a line in the plane. Id like to efficiently find the pair of points, consisting of one point from each set, with the minimum distance between them. Theres a really convenient looking paper by Radu Litiu, emClosest Pair for Two Separated Sets of Pointsem, but it uses an L1 Manhattan distance metric instead of Euclidean distance. p  pDoes anyone know of a similar algorithm which works with Euclidean distancep  pI can just about see an extension of the standard divide amp conquer closest pair algorithm  divide the two sets by a median line perpendicular to the original splitting line, recurse on the two sides, then look for a closer pair consisting of one point from each side of the median. If the minimal distance from the recursive step is d, then the companion for a point on one side of the median must lie within a box of dimensions 2dd. But unlike with the original algorithm, I cant see any way to bound the number of points within that box, so the algorithm as a whole just becomes Omn.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 8596 pIm trying to write a codeGPUImageFiltercode subclass that renders potentially thousands of feathered circles yes, its a brush stroke.

To get the behavior I want, I needp  precodeVector2 myVector  new Vector2Vector2.Zero initialize to zero with copy constructor codepre  pIm a little confused by Javas semantics here i.e someVector essentially seems to be a pointer rather than an actual object, so I have to create a new object and explicity copy the values. After reading up on that, I understand theres a lot of confusion on that topic. Is there a simple way to achieve the syntax Im looking for or should I just stick with option 2 If there isnt, is there a way to prevent the assignment in option 1 Its going to give me some hard to catch errors later if I dont stop it at compile time.p  pEdit Vector2 isnt immutable. What Id like is for Vector2.ZERO to be a constant value I can use for assignments, but then manipulate those new variables normally. Right now if I do that assignment in multiple places, then all of those are just pointers to the same object which because its static just accumulates the changes.p  pFor example, in Unity when working with vectors I would say something likep  precodeVector2 myFirstVector  Vector2.ZERO first vector, initialized to zero ...do some stuff to change the value of myFirstVector, Vector2.ZERO unchanged   Vector2 mySecondVector  Vector2.ZERO second vector, also initialized to zero ...do some stuff to mySecondVector codepre

Negative 8596 pWe recently added some jQuery pop up boxes to our website. Basically the script pops up a small styled text box when your mouse hovers over it. Unfortunately in IE9 this is causing some errors on the page with AJAX. There are other areas of the website where the code is par for par except for this script, which leads me to believe it is the problem. I cannot see what is causing IE 9 and IE 8 to act weird. Basically AJAX is pulling in incomplete data. p  pThe only error I am getting in developer tools is p  blockquote   pSEC7115 visited and link styles can only differ by color.

Negative 8596 pI have a request spec in a Rails engine. The view that is rendered calls a route and passes in a hash, i.e. codeprojectspathscope gt usercode. A route like this will eventually call codeurlforcode, but codeurlforcode is defined in many places.

Negative 8596 pIm trying to code a packet listener for a little server. Im very new to Java and this is the first time i mess around with networking. The whole idea its recive the packet, match the packet id with its class, pass the input stream to the constructor of the packet so it can be constructed and then give it to the packetHander, wich will have an overladed method for each packet. To achive this im using an array that maps the packets ids to the classes of each one, and using a method called decode to construct the packet. The problem its the overloading of handlePacket its not behaving as expected. Lets see some code.p  pIve the packet listener running in a thread and  the run method looks like thisp  precodepublic void run      try          int packetid         while packetid  istream.readInt  1              plugin.getServer.getConsoleSender.sendMessage[Comm] Recived packet   packetid             Packet packet  decodepacketid, istream              plugin.getServer.getConsoleSender.sendMessage[Comm] Packet is   Class.forNamepacket.getClass.getName                             plugin.getServer.getConsoleSender.sendMessage[Comm] Class is   Packet00ReqIdentify.class.castpacket.getClass.getName             plugin.getServer.getConsoleSender.sendMessage[Comm] Class is   Class.forNamepacket.getClass.getName.getName              handlePacketpacket               catch IOException  NoSuchMethodException  SecurityException  InstantiationException  IllegalAccessException  IllegalArgumentException  InvocationTargetException  ClassNotFoundException e          e.printStackTrace       codepre  pThe decode and handlePacket methods looks like thisp  precodeprivate void handlePacketPacket00ReqIdentify packet throws IOException      plugin.getServer.getConsoleSender.sendMessage[Comm] Got it  private void handlePacketPacket packet      plugin.getServer.getConsoleSender.sendMessage[Comm] Woops   private Packet decodeint packetid, PacketInputStream istream throws NoSuchMethodException, SecurityException, InstantiationException, IllegalAccessException, IllegalArgumentException, InvocationTargetException, ClassNotFoundException, IOException      Classlt extends Packetgt packetclass  packetsids.getpacketid     try          Constructorltgt packetconstructor  packetclass.getConstructorPacketInputStream.class         return Class.forNamepacketclass.getName.asSubclassPacket.class.castpacketconstructor.newInstanceistream      catch NoSuchMethodException e          return  Class.forNamepacketclass.getName.asSubclassPacket.class.castpacketclass.newInstance       codepre  ppacketsids its an array that contains the reference to the class of each packet, indexed by theirs idsp  precodeprivate static ArrayListltClasslt extends Packetgtgt packetsids codepre  pIt gets initialized this wayp  precodeprivate static void registerPacketint id, Classlt extends Packetgt oclass      packetsids.addid, oclass   static      packetsids  new ArrayListltClasslt extends Packetgtgt     registerPacketPacket00ReqIdentify.assignedpid, Packet00ReqIdentify.class     registerPacketPacket01Identify.assignedpid, Packet01Identify.class     registerPacketPacket02Heartbeat.assignedpid, Packet02Heartbeat.class  codepre  pIf i execute this and test it sending a packet of type 00, i get thisp  precode173749 [INFO] [Comm] Connection established to localhost11000 173749 [INFO] [Comm] Recived packet 0 173749 [INFO] [Comm] Packet is class com.gamerarg.commclient.protocol.Packet00ReqIdentify 173749 [INFO] [Comm] Class is com.gamerarg.commclient.protocol.Packet00ReqIdentify 173749 [INFO] [Comm] Class is com.gamerarg.commclient.protocol.Packet00ReqIdentify 173749 [INFO] [Comm] Woops codepre  pSo it means the packet00 has not been cathed by handlePacketPacket00ReqIdentify packet.

Negative 8596 pFor a hobby project I wish to develop some stuff for a WinCE 6.0 device. Ideally, I would have an activesync connection to debug from Visual Studio. The OS appears to have all the prerequisites in place, but Im not sure about the transport. What are my optionsp  pThe device has a USB port which can be used to connect e.g. flash drives for mp3 playback, so this seems to be a USB host port. Can I use this to obtain an activesync connection I guess using a usbtoserial cable on both pc and WinCE device could work. Or is there a RNDIS way perhapsp  pIf possible I rather not disassemble the unit, but if my chances of finding a USB client port or wired ethernet are nonzero I could consider that. Any thoughtsp

Negative 8596 pLets say you have a Python module which at some point makes calls to methods which have side effects like writing to a file. Say you want to have a dryrun mode where it only pretends to do what it is supposed to do but doesnt actually do it. How should one go about implementing this dryrun aspect which presents itself across different methods. e.g.p  precodeimport os.path  class Foo    def ReadSomethingself     with opensomepath, r as f       print f.read    def WriteSomethingself, content     if not os.path.isfilesomepath       with opensomepath, w as f         f.writecontent codepre  pSo I thought of using codeunittest.mockcode library to patch all the external APIs on the fly based on a variable like dryrun. That is something along the lines ofp  precodeDryRunPatcheropen DryRunPatcheros.path, isfile, returnvalueTrue def WriteSomethingself, content, mockisfile, mockopen codepre  pThen DryRunPatcher would be something likep  precodedef DryRunPatcherpatchargs, patchkwargs   def Decoratorfunc     def PatchIfDrunRunargs, kwargs       selfarg  args[0]   assuming its a method       if selfarg.dryrunmode         with mock.patch.objectpatchargs, patchkwargs           return funcargs, kwargs       else         return funcargs, kwargs     return PatchIfDryRun   return Decorator codepre  pThe code above might not work but you get the idea. However the issue is I guess mock is expected to be used for unit testing only. What else can one use to patch out external APIs to implement a dryrun mode I prefer the method itself be agnostic of the dryrun mode and not have to wrap every call with a side effect itself.p

Negative 8596 pSo I just recently upgrade to Mac OS X Yosemite and I need to set up my Apache again. I change file Sites permission to 777 and uncomment the php5module line in etcapache2httpd.conf just like before.p  plocalhost is working but localhostkevin gives me an  The requested URL kevin was not found on this server. p  pCan anyone help me with it Ive look online but I cant find a solution for my problem. Please help me....p  pHeres my httpd.conf file in case anyone needs to look at it. If theres someone wrong with it I will be grateful if anyone can post their httpd.conf file so I can recover it and do it again.p  precode  This is the main Apache HTTP server configuration file.  It contains the  configuration directives that give the server its instructions.  See ltURLhttphttpd.apache.orgdocs2.4gt for detailed information.  In particular, see   ltURLhttphttpd.apache.orgdocs2.4moddirectives.htmlgt  for a discussion of each configuration directive.   Do NOT simply read the instructions in here without understanding  what they do.  Theyre here only as hints or reminders.  If you are unsure  consult the online docs. You have been warned.     Configuration and logfile names If the filenames you specify for many  of the servers control files begin with  or drive for Win32, the  server will use that explicit path.  If the filenames do not begin  with , the value of ServerRoot is prepended  so logsaccesslog  with ServerRoot set to usrlocalapache2 will be interpreted by the  server as usrlocalapache2logsaccesslog, whereas logsaccesslog   will be interpreted as logsaccesslog.    ServerRoot The top of the directory tree under which the servers  configuration, error, and log files are kept.   Do not add a slash at the end of the directory path.  If you point  ServerRoot at a nonlocal disk, be sure to specify a local disk on the  Mutex directive, if filebased mutexes are used.  If you wish to share the  same ServerRoot for multiple httpd daemons, you will need to change at  least PidFile.  ServerRoot usr    Mutex Allows you to set the mutex mechanism and mutex file directory  for individual mutexes, or change the global defaults   Uncomment and change the directory if mutexes are filebased and the default  mutex file directory is not on a local disk or is not appropriate for some  other reason.   Mutex defaultprivatevarrun    Listen Allows you to bind Apache to specific IP addresses andor  ports, instead of the default. See also the ltVirtualHostgt  directive.   Change this to Listen on specific IP addresses as shown below to   prevent Apache from glomming onto all bound IP addresses.  Listen 12.34.56.7880 Listen 80    Dynamic Shared Object DSO Support   To be able to use the functionality of a module which was built as a DSO you  have to place corresponding LoadModule lines at this location so the  directives contained in it are actually available before they are used.

UserGroup The name or number of the usergroup to run httpd as.  It is usually good practice to create a dedicated user and group for  running httpd, as with most system services.  User www Group www  ltIfModulegt   Main server configuration   The directives in this section set up the values used by the main  server, which responds to any requests that arent handled by a  ltVirtualHostgt definition.  These values also provide defaults for  any ltVirtualHostgt containers you may define later in the file.   All of these directives may appear inside ltVirtualHostgt containers,  in which case these default settings will be overridden for the  virtual host being defined.     ServerAdmin Your address, where problems with the server should be  emailed.  This address appears on some servergenerated pages, such  as error documents.  e.g. adminyourdomain.com  ServerAdmin youexample.com    ServerName gives the name and port that the server uses to identify itself.  This can often be determined automatically, but we recommend you specify  it explicitly to prevent problems during startup.   If your host doesnt have a registered DNS name, enter its IP address here.  ServerName www.example.com80    Deny access to the entirety of your servers filesystem. You must  explicitly permit access to web content directories in other   ltDirectorygt blocks below.  ltDirectory gt     AllowOverride none     Require all denied ltDirectorygt    Note that from this point forward you must specifically allow  particular features to be enabled  so if somethings not working as  you might expect, make sure that you have specifically enabled it  below.     DocumentRoot The directory out of which you will serve your  documents. By default, all requests are taken from this directory, but  symbolic links and aliases may be used to point to other locations.  DocumentRoot LibraryWebServerDocuments ltDirectory LibraryWebServerDocumentsgt           Possible values for the Options directive are None, All,      or any combination of        Indexes Includes FollowSymLinks SymLinksifOwnerMatch ExecCGI MultiViews           Note that MultiViews must be named explicitly  Options All      doesnt give it to you.           The Options directive is both complicated and important.  Please see      httphttpd.apache.orgdocs2.4modcore.htmloptions      for more information.          Options FollowSymLinks Multiviews     MultiviewsMatch Any            AllowOverride controls what directives may be placed in .htaccess files.      It can be All, None, or any combination of the keywords        AllowOverride FileInfo AuthConfig Limit          AllowOverride None            Controls who can get stuff from this server.

If you do not specify an ErrorLog directive within a ltVirtualHostgt  container, error messages relating to that virtual host will be  logged here.  If you do define an error logfile for a ltVirtualHostgt  container, that hosts errors will be logged there and not here.  ErrorLog privatevarlogapache2errorlog    LogLevel Control the number of messages logged to the errorlog.  Possible values include debug, info, notice, warn, error, crit,  alert, emerg.  LogLevel warn  ltIfModule logconfigmodulegt           The following directives define some format nicknames for use with      a CustomLog directive see below.

If you do not define any access logfiles within a ltVirtualHostgt      container, they will be logged here.  Contrariwise, if you do      define perltVirtualHostgt access logfiles, transactions will be      logged therein and not in this file.      CustomLog privatevarlogapache2accesslog common            If you prefer a logfile with access, agent, and referer information      Combined Logfile Format you can use the following directive.          CustomLog privatevarlogapache2accesslog combined ltIfModulegt  ltIfModule aliasmodulegt           Redirect Allows you to tell clients about documents that used to       exist in your servers namespace, but do not anymore. The client       will make a new request for the document at its new location.      Example      Redirect permanent foo httpwww.example.combar            Alias Maps web paths into filesystem paths and is used to      access content that does not live under the DocumentRoot.      Example      Alias webpath fullfilesystempath           If you include a trailing  on webpath then the server will      require it to be present in the URL.  You will also likely      need to provide a ltDirectorygt section to allow access to      the filesystem path.            ScriptAlias This controls which directories contain server scripts.       ScriptAliases are essentially the same as Aliases, except that      documents in the target directory are treated as applications and      run by the server when requested rather than as documents sent to the      client.  The same rules about trailing  apply to ScriptAlias      directives as to Alias.          ScriptAliasMatch cgibiniwebobjects. LibraryWebServerCGIExecutables1  ltIfModulegt  ltIfModule cgidmodulegt           ScriptSock On threaded servers, designate the path to the UNIX      socket used to communicate with the CGI daemon of modcgid.

TypesConfig privateetcapache2mime.types            AddType allows you to add to or override the MIME configuration      file specified in TypesConfig for specific file types.          AddType applicationxgzip .tgz           AddEncoding allows you to have certain browsers uncompress      information on the fly. Note Not all browsers support this.          AddEncoding xcompress .Z     AddEncoding xgzip .gz .tgz           If the AddEncoding directives above are commentedout, then you      probably should define those extensions to indicate media types          AddType applicationxcompress .Z     AddType applicationxgzip .gz .tgz            AddHandler allows you to map certain file extensions to handlers      actions unrelated to filetype. These can be either built into the server      or added with the Action directive see below           To use CGI scripts outside of ScriptAliased directories      You will also need to add ExecCGI to the Options directive.          AddHandler cgiscript .cgi       For type maps negotiated resources     AddHandler typemap var            Filters allow you to process content before it is sent to the client.           To parse .shtml files for serverside includes SSI      You will also need to add Includes to the Options directive.          AddType texthtml .shtml     AddOutputFilter INCLUDES .shtml ltIfModulegt    The modmimemagic module allows the server to use various hints from the  contents of the file itself to determine its type.

Negative 8596 pLately i have been working on a form with which a user can select a checkbox and as a result of the selection it shows the database information in a table.p  pI browsed the stackoverflow questions and found a question that was almost the same, namely a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions22922796retrievedatafromsqldatabaseanddisplayintablesdisplaycertaindataaccRetrieve data from sql database and display in tables  Display certain data according to checkboxes checkedap  pSo with this information, and some other information from the web, i started to create my code. Though after completion i had several errors, namely my database fields were duplicate on output, the data that the field had isnt outputted and there were two warnings. After a lot of searching and editingtrying i couldnt find the right solution so hence me asking this question in here.   p  pBefore i display my code i first give some information about the checkboxes, database and tablefields and a small note it is a wordpress database.p  pI have 1 database called xxxwp1. THis database contains various wordpress tables but the table i want to retrieve information from is called wpparticipantsdatabase.p  pThis table contains various columns around 15. Though, for this testing example i used just 3 of the 15 columns named authorss, researchsource and researchtitle. I inserted some random information 3 rows in these 3 columns.  The form i created has, kinda obviously, 3 checkboxes for each column so 1 for authors, research source and title.p  pBased on the previous link and some wordpress information i started to create my code for the selection, it is as follows p  precodeltform methodpostgt ltinput typecheckbox namecolumns[] value1 gtltlabel forAuthorsgtAuthorsltlabelgtltbr gt ltinput typecheckbox namecolumns[] value2 gtltlabel forResearch SourcegtResearch Sourceltlabelgtltbr gt ltinput typecheckbox namecolumns[] value3 gtltlabel forResearch TitlegtResearch Titleltlabelgtltbr gt ltinput typesubmit namego valueSubmitgt ltformgt  ltphp   all  false columnnames  array1 gt Authors, 2gtResearch Source, 3gtResearch Title columnentries  issetPOST[columns]  POST[columns]  array sqlcolumns  array foreachcolumnentries as i     ifarraykeyexistsi, columnnames      sqlcolumns[]  columnnames[i]       if emptysqlcolumns   all  true  sqlcolumns[]    else   sqlcolumns[]  authorss,researchsource,researchtitle,  global wpdb  DNI CHECKBOX  ALL tmp  wpdbgtgetresults SELECT .implode,, sqlcolumns.

While typing this im thinking that this might also be part of the problem as this getresults is already getting results which i am also getting later onp  pAnyway, while testing this i get a few errors  misbehavior which i cant seem to figure out. p  pThe first errors are the following warnings p  ul liWarning mysqlquery expects parameter 1 to be string, array given in homexxxdomainsmysite.nlpublichtmlRecapwpcontentthemesradiatetemplatespdbsearchnew.php on line 32  which is this line of code coderesult  mysqlquerytmpcodeli liWarning mysqlfetchassoc expects parameter 1 to be resource, null given in homexxxdomainsmysite.nlpublichtmlRecapwpcontentthemesradiatetemplatespdbsearchnew.php on line 43  which is this line of code codewhile row  mysqlfetchassocresultcodeli ul  pThe second problem is that all of the columns are echod TWICE even before submitting. So this would mean this line of code is being done no matter what p  precodeif emptysqlcolumns   all  true  sqlcolumns[]    else   sqlcolumns[]  authorss,researchsource,researchtitle,  codepre  pWhen i check a option and press the submit button, the right column is being showed so yay that works, though all the 3 columns are still being showed no matter what as well as the selected one, so i got this if i select the first option  authorss   researchsource  researchtitle  Authors notice the first 3 are from my defined  while the last one is from my defined columnnames. p  pThe last problem is that the field values of the columns isnt being showed, the columns are just empty. p  pSo the question is of anybody could give me some pointers about what is going wrong.p  pThank you in advancep  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pI made some adjusting with the help of Zeusarmp  pSo firstly i changed the warnings among others the wpdbgetresults is changed to wpdbquery and the warnings are all gone. For some reason i gave the arraynames just their frontend names stupid me, so i changed it, like you suggested to the proper column names as they are in the database table. So field 1,2,3 became authorss, researchsource and researchtitle. p  pI also added the other changes. Although the errors are all gone, i still get all 3 the columns showed  1 duplicate depending on the number of checkboxes selected. Plus i still dont get the database data which is stored in the columns for example authorss has the following stored values in it Barry, Henk and Nicolas.. p  pThe code now looks like with the form left out as it remained the same p  precodeltphp all  false columnnames  array1 gt authorss, 2 gt researchsource, 3 gt researchtitle ifissetPOST[columns]     columnentries  POST[columns]     sqlcolumns  array     foreachcolumnentries as i          ifarraykeyexistsi, columnnames              sqlcolumns[]  columnnames[i]                   sqlcolumns[]  authorss     sqlcolumns[]  researchsource     sqlcolumns[]  researchtitle  else      all  true     sqlcolumns[]    global wpdb  DNI CHECKBOX  ALL tmp  wpdbgtquery SELECT .implode,, sqlcolumns.

Although i am retrieving the information i still have duplicates. When i go to the page, at first i have all 3 duplicates and the data retrieving is being output in the first 3 columns. When i select 1 checkbox option, the correct data of that checkbox is being displayed and the other data from the other checkboxes isnt so that works. Though, for example when i only choose the authors checkbox, the data of authors is being displayed in the first authors checkbox and only 1 duplicate namely authors is being showed. Though when i click only the second checkbox, research source column researchsource then the data of that column is only being showed what is correct BUT that data is being output in thew first authors column and again, 1 duplicate with the correct column name namely researchsource. p  pBut because a picture says more than a 1000 words, i added some images to clear it up. sorry for the links to the pictures but missing 2 reputation to post pics directlyp  pstrongThe starting columnspage untouchedstrong a hrefhttps1.postimg.org63bzbhh4vExamplepicture1.png relnofollowhttps1.postimg.org63bzbhh4vExamplepicture1.pngap  pstrongOnly authors selected and submittedstrong Left this one out as i can also only upload 2 links withh less than 10 rep...p  pstrongOnly Research Source selected and submittedstrong a hrefhttps29.postimg.orgnv0s6gj2fExamplepicture3.png relnofollowhttps29.postimg.orgnv0s6gj2fExamplepicture3.pngap

Negative 8596 pSo I need to do some async operations and was thinking about possible solutions. One of those solutions is to use threads to dispatch a work a job and have a callback be called upon completion but upon further reading I came across the Global Interpretor Lock GIL.p  pAs far as I am aware the GIL effectively makes the CPython single threaded as it blocks all nonrunning tasks until the other task is complete. If this is the case then why are threads used in Python Wouldnt it be simpler and more effective to spawn a new process instead which would be able to run in parallelp  pIm just trying to decide whether it is worth the time to use Python threads or whether I should use something else to deal with async operations instead.p  pPlease bear in mind I am using the standard CPython implementation and version 3.4.2 on Arch Linux.p

Negative 8596 pI have been developing on a Application that requires the use of IfStatements, however, Xcode seems to skip right over the If part of the IfStatement and goes straight into the Else part of the IfStatement.

Negative 8596 pI asked my question in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions27722749changethevalueofcomputedcolumninspecificconditionsnoredirect1comment4385824827722749this pagea but it did not solved. p  pI have a table named codeCirculationcode In library management system.  Column Name codeIsReturnedcode,codeDelaycode codeStartDatecode,codeTimecode and codeEndDatecodep  pI save both codeCheckincode and codeCheckoutcode in this table in this way that there is a column named codeIsReturnedcode that when a book checkout it is codeequalcode to codefalsecode and when the book in returned to the library codecheckincode it equals to codetruecode.p  pstrongI want to calculate the delay of a checkout toostrong. p  pMy column in this table are codeStartDatecode,codeTimecode and codeEndDatecode a computed column that is StartDate  Time. I want to calculated the Delay until the document not returned. until the codeIsReturnedcode column is false using a computed column.p  pI need that if the codeIsReturnedcode column is true , the value of Delay column should not change but if not it should update. p  pI use the below code to update the Delay column if codeIsReturned  0code but how can I change this code to doncodet change the delay value if thecodeIsReturned  1.p  precodeSELECT   DATEDIFFminute,DATEADDday, [Time],[StartDate],GETDATE FROM  dbo.Circulation  WHERE Id Id codepre  pUpdate  p  pMy Table is this  p  precodeALTER TABLE [dbo].[Circulation] [Id] [int] IDENTITY1,1 NOT NULL, [DocumentId] [int] NULL, [PersonId] [int] NULL, [LibrarianId] [int] NULL, [StartDate] [datetime] NULL, [IsReturned] [bit] NULL, [EndDate]  AS [StartDate][Time], [Time] [int] NULL, [Delay]  AS CASE WHEN [IsReturned]  1 THEN  ELSE DATEDIFFminute,DATEADDday, [Time],[StartDate],GETDATE codepre  pI think you do not understand my table yet. The EndDate is a computed column , too and it is StartDate  Time that times came from c Program in unit of minute. So if a book Checkedout from the library the StartDate and The EndDate are both have value but the IsReturned is false and when the book Checkedin , the IsReturned equals to true. I want to calculate the Delay column from Computed Column so that  1.

When IsReturned  1 the book has been checked in the Delay strongshould not be changed.strong it means if it is zero, it should be zero but if not, the value should not change to zero.p

Negative 8596 pThis is a bit of a strange question  Im designing an ad production specification sheet and template for a clients clients. I have good basic knowledge of HTMLCSS, and could probably cobble together a rudimentary JS plugin if need be. This client requested that I use PowerPoint for this template, but Id much rather attempt to do this with an HTML form. TLDR  heres my questionp  pWould it be possible to provide a zipped folder containing a localized site that allows his clients to drop their media and text into an HTML form p  pI know this isnt optimal, but I lack serverside experience and he probably wont be willing to pay someone to do backend work that is, I doubt we could add this form to his website. I suppose Id need to write a plugin to process the input, place it into a specified folder, and then display a screenshot of the media and text integrated into the UI that it will eventually be displayed in.p

I also dont understand why do you have the badge true  In  pushNotification.register  setmypushid,  getmypushiderror,    badgetrue,  soundtrue,  alerttrue,  ecbonNotificationAPN    If it does not display it when the message arrives I also set the badge  1 in the payload array in the message from the server. Currently the app is activated only if the user clicks on the message that arrives. If he doesnt click on it, the badge number is not displayed, and even if he opens the App, the app does not get the message so it is not displayed to the user.p

Negative 8596 pstrongeditstrongp  pSince originally posting this question, Ive gone down a couple more paths trying to solve the issue. Its still not solved, but now my questions are different. The original question is below, and then Ill add a section below that with updates.p  pstrongoriginal questionstrongp  pIm working on a Rails 4 application and having some trouble with JavaScript and the Chartkick gem.p  pI have two JavaScript functions that make it so that a user can click an icon and an element will drop down below the iconappear on the page, and the icon will switch from a rightpointing arrow to a downpointing arrow. The code is thisp  precodefunction ReverseDisplayd    ifdocument.getElementByIdd.style.display  none        document.getElementByIdd.style.display  block      else        document.getElementByIdd.style.display  none      function    .toggleicon.clickfunction      this.findi.toggleClassfaarrowcircleoright faarrowcircleodown     codepre  pAnd the hamlp  precodeahref javascriptReverseDisplaytogglestatsitem.id, class toggleicon   i.fa.faarrowcircleoright divid togglestatsitem.id, style display none     the items to be displayed codepre  pIt works. However, I expect the items that drop down to take up the full width of the page, like sop  pimg srchttpi62.tinypic.com2ci74uw.png altp  pBut instead, when I first click the toggle icon, they show up squished, like thisp  pimg srchttpi58.tinypic.com2ahb29e.png altp  pIf I then resize the browser just a tiny bit, the graph pops out to fullwidth, and it stays that way no matter what I do from there. I cant figure out how to get ahold of the generated markup, because this chart comes from Chartkick, as a gem. The generated html in the browser has this linep  precodeltdiv dirltr styleposition relative width 300px height 300pxgt codepre  pWhere the codewidth 300pxcode is whats being changed to codewidth 1000pxcode when I change the browser size. I dont have to change the browser size permanently or significantly. Once that width has changed to 1000px the first time it stays there  but the minute I refresh the page and click the icon to toggle the chart again, its back to 300px. I dont know how to hook into this div, because its generated by the gem and I dont know how to add a class to it. Ive tried adding styling to a parent element that ensures all of that parent elements children are codewidth 100code, but that doesnt do anything.p  pAnyway, I dont think that adding a class to it is the solution here. I just have no idea what is  I dont JavaScript incredibly well. Im pretty much completely new to all frontend work as a whole. Whats going on here, and how can I make these charts always be the full width of the page when theyre toggledp  pNotes Am testing this in Chrome. I tested in Firefox and it does the same thing.p  hr  pOK, Im starting to wonder if this has something to do with the fact that Im using a JavaScript function in order to capture dynamic item IDs  a page may have any number of these toggleable charts, and so calling a jQuery function on each id seems impossible, because I dont know what ID is.p  pI removed the jQuery call, however, and the problem persists.p  pOne of those times when rubberducking the Stack Overflow question box has not yet answered my question. So I guess Ill submit and hope for outside help here. p  pstrongadjusted questionstrongp  pa hrefhttpsgithub.comankanechartkickissues28 relnofollowThisa question in the Github issues for Chartkick has lead me down a different path. The solution is not necessarily in attempting to restyle the charts at all. Instead, what Im trying to do is trigger a resize event, because the chart automatically regenerates when the browser window is resized. This is both whats causing the problem and where the solution seems to lie.p  pMy codep  precode.row   .colsm12     h3.titleblock.secondchild       Stats by Video     .panelgroupdfaqList        claim.presenter.videos.eachwithindex do video, index         .panel.paneldefault           .panelheading             h4.paneltitle               a.chartdata  toggle collapse, parent faqList , href videoindex                   video.title at video.event.displayname on displaydatevideo.recordedat            div.panelcollapse.collapseid videoindex              .panelbody                 if video.impressions.count gt 0                  h4                    Impressions by Hours 24 hours                   linechart video.impressions.groupbydaycreatedat, range 1.day.ago...Time.now.count                  ...a couple more charts javascript   .chart.clickfunction      window.dispatchEventnew Eventresize    codepre  pSo the intention here is that when I click the code.panelheadingcode, this both drops down the code.panelbodycode with the charts in it and resizes the window, which makes the charts resize correctly or, rather, emshouldem.p  pIt kind of works, in that, when I first click the code.panelheadingcode trigger, it does not resize the charts, but when I click it emagainem, the charts are resized perfectly for a split second... just before they become hidden from view again. p  pIve tried adding a time out to the javascript, like sop  precodejavascript   .chart.clickfunction      setTimeout1000     window.dispatchEventnew Eventresize    codepre  pBut it doesnt appear to do anything at all.p  pSo what Im wondering here is how to get this coderesizecode event to work once the dropdown code.panelbodycode is out so that the charts will resize appropriately on their own.p  pHeres a screen cast of the current problem, in case I didnt describe it clearly enoughp  pa hrefhttpsyoutu.be5quMGABoDs8 relnofollowhttpsyoutu.be5quMGABoDs8ap
Negative 8596 pHiellop  pIm wondering whats wrong in the React example bellow or if React works differently than I thoughtp  pIm looking for a way to reuse the underlying html element for a child react component, when the parents are two different components. p  pIn the example bellow, I would like the  inside the Circle component to have the same element after renderC1 and renderC2 is called. For instance so that I could apply a transition css property to animate the color switch, like they would if I e.g. just changed the style directly on the element.p  pWhen I render the bellow, React always seems to generate different HTML elements, ref, key or id on the DIV in the render function of Circle doesnt help much.p  pSo my questions is it possible to get React to just reuse the DIV that gets rendered via C1 when C2 is rendered I thought this was how React should work, optimizing the underlying HTML elementsp  pSomething likep  pre classlangjs prettyprintoverridecodevar C1  React.createClass   render function       return          ltCircle backgrounddeeppink onClickrenderC2gt            function renderC1     React.render     ltC1 gt,      document.getElementByIdmountpoint   var C2  React.createClass   render function       return          ltCircle backgroundsalmon onClickrenderC1gt            function renderC2         React.render     ltC2 gt,      document.getElementByIdmountpoint   var Circle  React.createClass   styler      width 100px,     height 100px,     mozBorderRadius 50,     webkitBorderRadius 50,     borderRadius 50,     background hotpink   ,    componentWillMount function      if this.props ampamp this.props.background ampamp        this.props.background  this.styler.background           this.styler.background  this.props.background        ,    render function      return         tried adding key, ref and id, but does not reuse element        ltdiv onClickthis.props.onClick stylethis.stylergtltdivgt           renderC1 codepre

Example code is a hrefhttpsgithub.comcosmicexplorersemanticcodebrowserbloblispsizetestingparsesexp.lispL18 relnofollowherea codemake checkccode works, but codemake checkcppcode exhausts the stack as belowp  precodeINFO Control stack guard page unprotected Control stack guard page temporarily disabled proceed with caution Unhandled SBKERNELCONTROLSTACKEXHAUSTED in thread ltSBTHREADTHREAD                                                          main thread RUNNING                                                           10034E6DE3gt   Control stack exhausted no more space for function call frames.

The other option which Ive started working on is to write an iterative version of codereadcode which relies upon the more limited syntax that Im feeding into it from a separate program to avoid the complexity of reimplementing read my currently broken attempts at that are in the codelispcode branch of the above repository.p  pHowever, Id prefer a more canonical solution. Are there alternatives to the builtin codereadcode that can parse deeply nested structures by avoiding recursionp  pEDIT This appears to be an insurmountable issue with sbcl itself, not the input data. For a quick example, try runningp  precodefor i in seq 1 2000 do echo n  done echo n 2 for i in seq 1 2000 do echo n  done echo gt file codepre  pAnd then in sbclp  precodewithopenfile file file direction input read file codepre  pThe same failure occurs.p  pEDIT Asked around on codesbclcode, and apparently the control stack size really applies only to new threads, and that the stack size for the main thread is affected by a lot of other factors as well. So I tried putting the read in a separate thread. Still didnt work.

I so far have failed in implementing the former, and Im still not sure how to implement the latter.p  pI also tried learning about property bindings so that I could have the codeSlider.valuePropertycode change in the UI thread changing a UI element in the UI thread makes sense... right while changing an intermediate variable, which I called codestatecode and created from a class codestateObjectcode, on a background thread. After the background thread calculates the value I want to give to the slider, it changes the codestatecodes value, which is bound to the codeSlidercodes value. I thought separating the value calculation into a background thread and codeSlidercode valuechanging into the UI thread would do the trick, but I keep getting the hangup or infamous codeIllegalStateExceptioncode exception, codeNot on FX application threadcodep  pIm not wholly sure how the codePlatform.runLatercode magic is supposed to work, but I still get a hangup whether I run my runnable interface inside that or a codeThreadcode.p  pAny help or explanation as to why these attempts have failedhow to make things work would be greatly appreciated.p  pCheers, Mikep  precodeimport javafx.application. import javafx.stage. import javafx.scene. import javafx.scene.layout. import javafx.scene.control. import javafx.geometry.

Negative 8596 pI have a question related with the blocks execution on the SMx. Ive performed a experiment where several kernels are launched from different MPI processes in a GPU K20c. The GPU is shared for the MPI processes by CUDA MPS. According to the MPS documentation a hrefhttpsdocs.nvidia.comdeploypdfCUDAMultiProcessServiceOverview.pdf relnofollowhttpsdocs.nvidia.comdeploypdfCUDAMultiProcessServiceOverview.pdfa, a stream is associated to each MPI process, so that each MPI process can concurrently execute its kernel with other kernel belonging to other MPI process. For understanding this behaviour, Ive visualized this experiment with Visual Profiler tool. Visual Profiler show me that some kernels are being executed concurrently, but at the same time. That is to say, both kernels are absolutely overlapped between them Not only a small part of them. It seems as if the blocks belonging to both kernels are sharing the SMx at the same time. As far as I know, a SMx can only have blocks belonging to the same kernel. Do you have any idea why this is happening. Thank you so much.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pThanks for your response RobertCrovella. Ive taken a look at the slides which you suggested me. According to the slides, each SMx has 4 warps schedulers and that warps can come from either different threadblocks or different concurrent kernels, Ok. I understand that when the expression different concurrent kernels is named, it refers to different kernels launched on different streams concurrently. Therefore, I think that the warps belonging to different blocks from different kernels could be scheduled by the 4 warps schedulers belonging to a SMx. However, Ive only observed this behaviour when my application is launched with CUDA MPS. When my application is only launched with streams, only a small part of the kernels the end of a kernel with the start of other kernel is overlapped. This is normal as far as I know, but the other behaviour is strange for me.p
Negative 8596 pI have a small rest api built in python using Falcon Framework and it runs in a virtual environment with gunicorn  gevent and pypy 2.3 I successfully installed the pip packages from geventpypyhacks and geventonpypypypycore. I wanted to add a supervisor for my application so I first installed supervisord and followed the steps to get it up and running.p  pThe first thing I did in the server was to test the command to start the api it ran successfully and I could use the api without any issues. The command isp  precodebinbash c cd pathtoprojectapi ampamp pathtoprojectenvbingunicorn c settings.py myapimyapi codepre  pNote in settings.py I set the parameter codedaemonFalsecode since I saw that supervisors require that the commands are run in the foreground and not daemonized.p  pOnce that was working, I went ahead and created the apps codeetcsupervisorconf.dmyapi.confcode conf file with the command parameter set as the command above I ran successfully.

Negative 8596 pGiven a data structure for sets, testing two sets for equality seems to be a desirable task, and indeed many implementations allow this e.g. builtin  sets in python.p  pThere are different set implements in Erlang codesetscode, codeordsetscode, codegbsetscode. Their documentation does not indicate, whether it is possible to test equality using term comparison , nor do they provide explicit functions for testing equality.p  pSome naive cases seem to allow equality testing with , but I have a larger application where Im able to produce codesetscode and codegbsetscode which are equal tested with the function below but do not compare equal with . For codeordsetscode, they always compare equal. Unfortunately I havent found a way to produce a minimal example for cases where equal sets do not compare equal with .p  pFor reliably testing equality I use the following function, based on this a hrefhttpsproofwiki.orgwikiEquivalenceofDefinitionsofSetEquality relnofollowtheorem on set equalityap  precode doc Compare two sets for equality. spec setsequalsetsset, setsset gt boolean. setsequalSet1, Set2 gt     setsissubsetSet1, Set2 andalso setsissubsetSet2, Set1. codepre  pMy questionsp  ol liIs their a rationale, why Erlang set implementations do not offer  explicit equality testingli liHow to explain the difference when testing set equality with  with for the different set implementationsli liHow can produce a minimal example of codesetscode where  does not compare equal but the sets are equal given the above codeli ol  pstrongSome thoughts on question 2strongp  pThe documentation for codesetscode states, that The representation of a set is not defined. where as the documentation of codeordsetscode states, that An ordset is a representation of a set. The documentation on codegbsetscode does not give any comparable indication. The following comment, from the a hrefhttpsgithub.comerlangotpblobmaintlibstdlibsrcsets.erl relnofollowsource code of the codesetscode implementationa, seems to reiterate the statement from the documentation p  blockquote   pNote that as the order of the keys is undefined we may freely reorder keys within in a bucket.p blockquote  pMy interpretation is, that term comparison with  in Erlang works on the representation of the sets, i.e. two sets only compare equal if their representation is identical. This would explain the different behavior of the different set implementations but also reinforces the question, why there is no explicit equality comparison.p

Negative 8596 pI got a JInternalFrame with an underlying JavaFX structure. Inside this frame there are some standard FX elements like TableViews, TextFields, ... . I implemented some DragampDrop features, for example reordering a TableView, dragging a row onto a TextField and so on. Its working quite nice, there are no errors dropping stuff onto the targets that implemented the EventHandlers for the setOnDragOver and setOnDragDropped methods and do accept this drag.p  pIf however I drag a row can be something else like a String or an Integer  and drop it somewhere onto the frame which is not a drag target no implementation of setOnDragOver and setOnDragDropped I get an internal Java SwingFX mixed error.

Negative 8596 pFrom what Ive understood, tracking algorithms predict where a given object will be in the next frame after object detection is already performed. The object is then again recognized in the next frame. What isnt clear is how the tracker then knows to associate the object in the 2nd frame as the same as the one in the 1st, especially when there are multiple objects in the frame.p  pIve seen in a few places that a cost matrix is created using Euclidean distance between the prediction and all detections, and the problem is framed as an assignment problem Hungarian algorithm.p  pIs my understanding of tracking correct Are there other ways of establishing that an object in one frame is the same as an object in the next framep

Negative 8596 pWe all have terrible experiences with two factor authentication implemented by Visa, MasterCard and other card networks. Here in India, it is mandatory to implement 3D secure to process ecommerce transactions. This leads to many bad experiences as the user gets redirected every time to the VisaMasterCard website. Also they have a very bad user interface. Is there any way you could implement 3D secure without redirecting the user. I know one possible method could be to use iFrames but that also brings in the question of bad user experience.p  pSo my question is, What is the best way to implement 3D secure by card issuers without redirecting the user and hopefully improving their existing UI. I could not stumble across their APIs so please do let me know if there are existing solutions.p

Consider replacing associative containers with sorted vectorsp  pThe standard associative containers are typically implemented as balanced binary search trees. A balanced binary search tree is a data structure that is optimized for a mixed combination of insertions, erasures, and lookups. That is, its designed for applications that do some insertions, then some lookups, then maybe some more insertions, then perhaps some erasures, then a few more lookups, then more insertions or erasures, then more lookups, etc. The key characteristic of this sequence of events is that the insertions, erasures, and lookups are all mixed up. In general, theres no way to predict what the next operation on the tree will bep

Negative 8596 pI am trying to make a program to play poker. When betting the player should enter an integer number as their new bet. To prevent errors when someone mistypes and enters a string the code is intended to take in a string, check if it is a number, and if it is not then ask the player to enter a valid bet.p  pThe code below is my attempt at making a function to do that using the istringstream function to convert the string betstring to an int. p  pistringstream returns 0 if the string has no number in it. betstring is an invalid entry if it is a number less than 0 or if it contains no numbers. If betstring is 0 this is a valid bet. p  pIf betstring is mixed letters and numbers e.g. j96kp then this j96kp is assumed to indicate a bet of 96 for simplicity so it is valid.p  pThe problem comes when I enter a betstring equal to 0. The code interprets this as an invalid bet. I have checked the logic operators and I do not understand why the code does not take 0 to be a valid bet.p  pCan anybody spot where the problem is arisingp  precodeinclude ltstdlib.hgt include ltstdio.hgt include ltsstreamgt include ltstringgt  using namespace std  int requestBet      int newbet     string betstring     int validbet  0     whilevalidbet      loop until a valid bet is entered         cin gtgt betstring         validbet  1 assume bet is valid then test this         istringstreambetstring gtgt newbet          ifnewbet  0 ampamp betstring.at0  0  newbet lt 0                      cout ltlt Enter a valid bet ltlt endl             validbet  0                   return newbet   int main      int number     cout ltlt Enter your bet ltlt endl     number  requestBet     return 0  codepre

Negative 8596 pIm curious if this is a situation any other folks have found themselves in.  I have an NSDictionary stored in a plist that Im basically using as an associative array strings as keys and values.  I want to use the array of keys as part of my application, but Id like them to be in a specific order not really an order that I can write an algorithm to sort them into.  I could always store a separate array of the keys, but that seems kind of kludgey because Id always have to update the keys of the dictionary as well as the values of the array, and make sure they always correspond.  Currently I just use [myDictionary allKeys], but obviously this returns them in an arbitrary, nonguaranteed order.  Is there a data structure in ObjectiveC that Im missing  Does anyone have any suggestions on how to more elegantly do thisp
Negative 8596 pIve written a DLL that may be used in a number of ways referenced by ASP.NET web sites, WinForms, etc..  It needs to load its data from several delimited files that will be automatically updated on a semiregular basis.  For performance reasons, Im loading the data into a static object a generic List, and only want to go back to the files when the data changes.  The amount of data doesnt take up an unreasonable amount of memory, but it does take too long to read from the file on every access.

Negative 8596 pI am writing a native CC .dll program which calls to .dll functions of many third party CC libraries and returns a cc structure array SA of 18 columns by 0n lines.

Negative 8596 pI have a class that i use to do downloads. The class is observable and i use it as a swing UI model object too.

I tried to model this as a state machine hidden internally, however the middle running state has a InputStream  a thread. What is the correct way to turn this into a immutable wrapper 1 Make class into a wrapper for a state machine  the immutable state. Make start start the first machine state, then notify observers on each state change with a immutable copy. however the client expectation of a monolitic class  for the model of the swing ui for ex, is problematic.p  p2 Give up on using the wrapper as swing model. just register my controller as a observer, start and add the first immutable state as a model and use a immutable state identifier for example the download url to recognize the download state machine state emitted by notifyObservers as belonging to some download, to replace each successive state  update the ui. However i dont think this is very usable when this is used without interest in notification. At least a way to wait for the download to be complete would be nice nop

Negative 8596 pIm having some questions Id like to clarify.p  ol lipVolatile read ensure you read the latest value of a variable. Does it means that it forces to all CPUs to flush their cached values for that variable only that variable or all So if it will force all CPUs to flush cached writes and get latest version from main memory, is this a memory barrierpli lipVolatile write ensure you write a value to the variable in main memory. Does it means that it void all the cached values for that variable in all CPUspli lipAre you using a memory barrier when you use the keyword volatilepli lipInterloked performs a readmodifywrite in an atomic operation. Does Interlocked ensure that you are for example incrementing the latest version of a variable and the other CPUs will see this change I think so because its supposed to use a memory barrier, but Im not sure. So could we say that Interloked is doing a VolatileReadmodifyVolatileWrite atomicallypli lipWhen you use a memory barrier, does it affect to all variables in all CPUS, or just the surrounding onespli lipLocking is expensive because it causes two memory barriers and a context switch if the thread has to wait, but then what is the advantage of Interlocked just to avoid the context switchpli lipWhat is the deal with ReaderWriterLockSlim and recursivity I didnt understans what is the issue.pli ol  pAs you can see, I have a total mess in my mind right now.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 8596 pMy problem is a difference in how Python searches for modules on WindowsLinux.p  pI have a directory codefoocode on a Windows 7 machine NTFS, which I mount in a Ubuntu 10.04 virtual guest running on the same machine via VirtualBox guest additions.

Negative 8596 pIm hoping to gain clarity on the behavior of the dense rank function when working with joins. I got a great solution to a post of mine earlier here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9555354sqlserverrecursivectehelpwantedSQL Server recursive cte help wanteda In looking at the solution, which involves using dense rank along with an inner join to partition data with breaks at missing data points.p  pSo Based on how I read the solution, when in an inner join, dense rank includes in its ranking rows that are on the left side, but not on the right. I set up a small test of this, and I cant reproduce that behavior. For example, when I run the query and I use a basic select statement on the cte, without partitioning it again as it is in the original query, and the data point for 1512, A is missing, I getp  precodeTradeDate     Symbol Clse   DenseRank RowNumber 20120103    A      36.48  1     1 20120104    A      36.19  2     2 20120106    A      37.40  4     3 codepre  pBased on my current understanding, the dense rank value above would just go from 2 to 3 on the last two records, since the join doesnt return a match for the date in tblDailyPricingAndVol. Thanks in advance.p

I understand that I can initialize codebarcode at run time using a separate subroutine, likep  precodemodule foomodule   implicit none   type footype      integer  x      logical, pointer  xflag gt null   end type footype    logical, target  barflag   typefootype  bar contains   subroutine init     barx  1     barxflag gt barflag   end subroutine init end module foomodule codepre  pBut is it possible to do this without an initialization subroutine Or is it possible to declare an initialization subroutine which is called explicitly by the compiler Note this must be done in Fortran 95.p
Negative 8596 pIm building an app that would analyze phones motion through accelerometer and gyroscope output. It is likely that I will capture this motion as a set of variables that the app would keep track of internally. p  pIm trying to include a way to graph these variables and equations involving these variables. I would like to offer the user an ability to adjust how the app displays equations of these variables by typing equations like a  b  c  d  with the a,b,c variables being calculated by my app. The user can write equations and graph variables in the field. Since it has been ages since I wrote an algebraic parser in any language, strongIm wandering if theres an expression parser in objectivec that I can readily plug into my appstrong, where a user would type something like a  b  c  d into a text field and the app would tokenize and substitute variables that I provide in place of the userentered placeholders.p

Negative 8596 pIm trying to write a program that generates 2d mazes. The body of the maze is a 2d int array. The border cells have a value of 2. Blocked cells walls have a value of 1, and empty cells paths have a value of 0. Initially, I am setting the value of all cells to 1. Then, starting from a random column in the top row, I move through the maze setting the current cell to 0 until I reach the bottom row. p  pThis all worked fine, except that, rather than a singleline path, I often ended up with wide areas of 0s.

Negative 8596 papache here I refer to apache2 webserver I have a setup where in my jsp calls to tomcat are routed by apache using modjk. Both servers reside on the same machine. I want to do away with the modjk connector, instead the calls coming to apache is served by making a curl call to the localhost tomcat server. p  pThe problem is the queries comming are of the type somethingsomething.jsp or anythinganything.jsp. I want all this requests coming to apache be serviced by a common php code, which will do the corresponding curl call and return the response. The reason I am using the php connector is for some specific logging purposes.p  pCompletely new to the apache world so any help would be really appreciated p

Negative 8596 pIm writing an HTTP server in C using sockets. It can listen on multiple ports and works on a 1threadperport basis to run listening loops and each loop spawns another thread to deliver a responsep  pThe code works perfectly when delivering standard HTTP responses. I have it set up to respond with an HTML page with JavaScript code that just refreshes the browser repeatedly in order to stress test the server. Ive tested this with my computer running as the server and 4 other devices spamming it with requests at the same time.p  pNo crashes, no dropped connections and no memory leaks. CPU usage never jumps beyond 5 running on a 2.0 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo in HTTP mode with 4 devices spamming requests.p  pI just added OpenSSL yesterday so it can deliver secure responses over HTTPS. That went fairly smoothly as it seems that all I had to do with replace some standard socket calls with their OSSL counterparts for secure mode based on the solution to this question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7698488turnasimplesocketintoansslsocketTurn a simple Socket into an SSL Socketa.p  pThere is one SSL context and codeSSLcode struct per connection. It does work but not very reliably. Again, each response happens on its own thread but multiplerapidconcurrent requests in secure mode are getting dropped seemingly at random, though there are still no crashes or memory leaks in my code.p  pWhen a connection is dropped the browser will either say its waiting for a response that never happens Chrome or just says the connection was reset Firefox.p  pFor reference, here is the updated connection creation and closing code.p  pstrongConnection creation code main part of the listening loopstrongp  precode Note    sslCtx and sslConnection exist           elsewhere in memory allocated specifically           for each connection.  struct sockaddrin clientAddr  memseted to 0 before accept int clientAddrLength  sizeofclientAddr  ...  int clientSocketHandle  acceptserverSocketHandle, struct sockaddr ampclientAddr, ampclientAddrLength  ...  if useSSL      int usecert, useprivateKey, acceptresult       sslCtx  SSLCTXnewSSLv23servermethod     SSLCTXsetoptionssslCtx, SSLOPSINGLEDHUSE      usecert  SSLCTXusecertificatefilesslCtx, sslCertificatePath , SSLFILETYPEPEM     useprivateKey  SSLCTXusePrivateKeyfilesslCtx, sslCertificatePath , SSLFILETYPEPEM      sslConnection  SSLnewsslCtx     SSLsetfdsslConnection, clientSocketHandle      acceptresult  SSLacceptsslConnection   ...

What could be going wrong for HTTPS responsesp  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pIve updated the code with OpenSSL callbacks for mutlithreaded environments and the server is slightly more reliable using code from an answer to this question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3417706opensslandmultithreadsOpenSSL and multithreadsa.p  pI wrote a small command line program to spam the server with HTTPS requests and it is not dropping any connections with 5 multiple instances of it running at the same time. Multiple instances of Firefox also appear not to be dropping any connections.p  pWhat is interesting however is that connections are still being dropped with modern WebKitbased browsers. Chrome starts to drop connections at under 30 seconds of spamming, Safari on an iPhone 4 iOS 5.1 rarely makes it past 3 refreshes before saying the connection was lost, but Safari on an iPad 2 iOS 5.0 seems to cope the longest but ultimately ends up dropping connections as well.p

Negative 8596 pWhile posting a comment recently, I found myself remarking that, in my experience, Boost is not widely used in regulated industries FDA, FAA.  In fact, I dont know of any project that uses it or has used it.  I realize, though, that my experience may be lacking here, so I wanted to know if emanybodyem had knowledge of a project using boost in a medical device or in an aviation flight system lighting, cabin controls, cockpit equipment, etc..p  pI am not sure this is the right place to ask it maybe some other SO site, but I thought this would be a good place to start.p  pThis is not a question about whether or not boost should be used in these areas, it is a question about anybody knowing if it has been used.p  pstrongEDITstrong Some examples projects that might help clarify this Aircraft cabin lighting systems, cabin management systems, cockpit instrumentation, infusionfoodinsulin pumps, dialysis machines, laboratory diagnostic devices, blood center data collection systems, etc.  Some are life sustaining or potentially flight critical, some collect data, some collect data used to make medical decisions, etc., but I believe all are covered as regulated devices by the FAAFDA.p  pstrongEDITstrong Outside did not come with the development chain libraries are often brought into these types of projects for other purposes graphics libraries, drivers, USB stacks, etc.  These are treated as a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiSOUP28softwareofunknownpedigree29SOUPa.  The use of boost would fall under this approach.  Does anybody know of a project where boost was used this wayp  pstrongEDITstrong  Boost is a very large framework, with multiple components.  Im looking for any part of it that has been used in a project.  For example Boost smart pointers or Boost Enable or Boost Array or Boost Optional, etc.  But used in whole, not part.  Not used by looking at the Boost code and reusing the idea used as a whole component of the system i.e. the legal sense.  p  pstrongThis is central to the question, because used in this way means that tradeoffs of handling the SOUP must be dealt with.strong  This may place this question outside the scope of this SO site...not sure.p
Negative 8596 pThe way DerbyJS a hrefhttpderbyjs.com relnofollowhttpderbyjs.coma seems to work at the moment is that it replaces everything in the body tag of the document whenever you click a link.p  pIs there anyway to say use the  template, but replace the content inside maincontent with that instead of the whole bodyp  pNavigation on the left is fixed and doesnt need the benefits of realtime interaction.p  pWhy this is an issue is needing to run some Javascript on the page load to set the size of some containers based on the size of a users browser window, and once I click a link, this setup gets wiped and recreated, and of course, the Javascript doesnt run again, because the document itself hasnt refreshed, just the body.p  pThis would also allow me to write nicer jQuery bindings for the most part, codeelement.clickcode, rather than codehtml.onclick,element, ...codep  pAny thoughts, or is this a step too far for this framework at this point in timep  pP.S. As Im only just getting started with Derby, and realtime frameworks in general, maybe what Im trying to do isnt best practice anyway I chose Derby because I like the UX part of initial render on the server, then the rest in the client, but sharing routers, which reduces the duplication of code. Open to any better ways of achieving this.p

Negative 8596 pThis problem Im facing may sound trivial to you but Im wondering, beside ENUM type, what can one use to store numerical values for category, subcategory and multiple tags in a single columnp  pScenario  lia DB entry needs to have category id4, subcategoryid43 and tagsid78,id85,id98,id112, etc.li litblentry has a column categories or similar to that, with the aim to hold those values 4,43,7,85,98,112,...lip  pIs ENUM really suitable and recommended way of storing itp  pHowever, I am thinking about leaving out such a column completely and apply somewhat Wordpresslike solution  create taxonomies cat, subcat, tag, and then in another table called relationships put the ID of my entry to be paired with correct taxonomies. The issue with this solution is that 50,000 entries would produce so many relationship rows 1 for cat, 1 for subcat, but up to 20 for tags.p  pCan you elaborate at the proposed ways andor suggest new onesp  pEDITSp  pBelow is a suggestion to avoid storing multiple values in a single column at all costs. Acknowledged and appreciatedp  pIm thinking about creating 3 separate tables for cat, subcat, tags. Additionally, this way I may be able to employ Martin Fowlers pattern Data Mapper with Table inheritance for handling this aspect of my app categorization of entries.p

If encapsulation is the reason for that or hiding the data then why not in model in MVCp  pActually, in the  above class example can I only use p  precodeConsole.WriteLineexample.number  codepre  pafter declaring it codepubliccodep  pThen whats the use of creating property over herep

Negative 8596 pI manage a web site that is hosted by Apache and is protected using Kerberos authentication MS AD KDC. Most users are inhouse employees with domainjoined computers that log onto the web site using Kerberos SSO. However, I also have to support outside users, who are using devices from other domains no trust or no domain at all. Using fallback to Basic authentication, they will need to enter their domain credentials manually in the browser to log in.p  pThe problem is that the outside users are prompted to enter their passwords multiple times, as the various elements of the web site is downloaded, even though they have opted to save their passwords in the browser.p  pUsing Fiddler or Wireshark I can see the following network exchanges taking placep  precode    Request GET index.html HTTP1.1     Response     401 Unauthorized     WWWAuthenticate Negotiate     WWWAuthenticate Basic realmAuthentication      Request GET index.html HTTP1.1     Authorization Negotiate XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX     Response     401 Unauthorized     WWWAuthenticate Basic realmAuthentication      Request GET index.html HTTP1.1     Authorization Basic XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX     Response     200 OK codepre  pApache logp  precode    GET  HTTP1.1 401 381     GET  HTTP1.1 401 381     GET  HTTP1.1 200 6558 codepre  pThis 3roundtrip exchange is repeated when requesting other resources CSS, Java scripts, images, REST, etc., each time resulting in the user being prompted to reenter his credentials. As far as I can tell, the browser Chrome in this case establishes a minimum of two connections HTTPS tunnels, but additional connections are created when accessing resources in different subfolders. Once all these connections have been established, requesting additional resources does not require reentering passwords.p  pThis behavior is not browser specific, although it seems to me that it is the browsers that choose to create multiple connections and fails to reuse the stored password when falling back to Basic authentication once Kerberos Negotiate authentication fails.p  pIm aware that unlike most HTTP authentication schemes Kerberos authentication is connectionbased, so reauthentication is necessary for each connection that the browser chooses to establish. I just dont understand why browsers insist on prompting the users for credentials multiple times.p  pApache config extractp  precodeltVirtualHost default443gt   SSLEngine on   ...   ltLocation gt     SSLRequireSSL     SSLOptions StrictRequire OptRenegotiate     SSLVerifyClient none      AuthType Kerberos     KrbAuthRealms EXAMPLE.COM     Krb5Keytab etchttpdconfhttpd.keytab     KrbAuthoritative on     KrbMethodNegotiate on     KrbMethodK5Passwd on     KrbServiceName Any     KrbLocalUserMapping on     require validuser ltLocationgt codepre  pIs this a clientside or serverside issue How can I fix thisp

Negative 8596 pCoffeeScript support generator now, but, I found only you use codeyieldcode keyword, then your function will be compiled to generator, here is my question, I use codekoacode to write my code, and some middleware I do not need async logic, so I dont need codeyieldcode, so, CoffeeScript think it is an normal function, but, codekoacode says codeapp.use requires a generator functioncode, TT, anyone have a solution Thank Youp
Negative 8596 pI can get my script to run, but it wont run correctly and Im very confused.  Im trying to create a website where a user clicks a button, and this causes a python script on the server to start running.  The script is supposed to be able to open a csv file, and work with the data stored in it.  This script works if I run it normally from the command line.  It is able to open the csv files, and if the file doesnt exist, gives me an error like thisp  precodeTraceback most recent call last File LaserProfile.py, line 224, in electrodeData data  np.loadtxtfilepath, delimiter  ,, skiprows  2 File CAnacondalibsitepackagesnumpylibnpyio.py, line 734, in loadtxt fh  iteropenfname, U IOError [Errno 2] No such file or directory 172.16.113.55filerootU1201503566Laser15997.csv codepre  pBasically, runs exactly the way it should.
