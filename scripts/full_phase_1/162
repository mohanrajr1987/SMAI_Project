Positive 162 pI am migrating an old C Windows Service that hosts COM objects. I managed to create a .Net Windows Service and a COM visible Serviced Component, but only in separate projects.p  pWhat I need is for our legacy applications to be able to create instances of my new objects via COM interface these objects shall be hosted in a Windows Service process that can be managed from the Services administration tool started, delay started, paused, resumed, stopped. There are other reasons why it must be a Windows Servicep  ul liThere must be only one systemwide instance of its process at any given time.li liIt must be longlived, because it holds static data and performs background processing on it.li liIt should be active before the first COM object is instantiated.li liIt should be automatically started by the first COM object is instantiated should it be stopped at that time for any reason.li liObject instances will run within the service process.li liRuns with the Network Service identity.li liClients will not be upgraded  modified.li ul  pAll these points were nicely covered by the old COM Service construct from Visual C 6.0, but with VB.Net Framework 4 I dont know how to do it.p  pPerhaps I could merge the .Net Windows Service and the Serviced Component somehow, or there might be other ways to expose classes in my Windows Service.p  pEDITp  pI forgot to mention one important reason I need it to be a standard Windows Service It must be able to perform some rather lengthy tasks when it is going to be stopped. Clients will entrust the COM objects with tasks to be performed in background. If the service is stopped prematurely, some of these tasks will be left undone. Its OK as long as the service can perform some cleanup procedures inserts, updates, etc. which might take anywhere from none to ten or more seconds. It doesnt need to be bullet proof it wont but a normal system shut down or a maintenance service stop must not leave unkept things behind.p

At runtime, its possible that the dynamic object is being resolved as an instance of ClassA instead of ClassB, perhaps due to the signature of the method that returned the object since it defined ClassA as the return type.p  pIve used dynamic successfully for many of the COM objects in this library, but am specifically having trouble with a few of the methodsproperties on an instance of a class that is like ClassB in this example.p  pThoughtsideasworkarounds are appreciated.

Positive 162 pWe have an application that can run as a Windows service or as a user mode app.  As part of its processing, it launches a second executable that interacts with MAPI to read the contents of an MSG file.

Positive 162 pI call into a COM component from a C project, via an interop assembly that I generate from the COM DLL. The COM interface has DispIds defined and I have verified that these appear in the generated interop assembly.p  pEmpirically, if I upgrade the COM component to a newer version, the interop calls go horribly wrong as if its calling the wrong COM methods.p  pIs this expected, i.e. that the interop assembly is tightly bound to the specific version of the COM interface that it was generated for I had naively assumed that as long as the DispIds and function prototypes matched up in the new COM component, which they do, it would all work OK.p  pIs there a way of telling the CLR to use the DispIds when calling into the COM component via the interop assembly, i.e. a late binding of sorts I know it is possible to use late binding using reflectionstyle C code, but this would be less convenient than an interop assembly.p

Positive 162 pThere are questions asking on how to get Registration free COM working, and this is not one of those. I have a DirectShow video source filter catagory code860BB3105D0111d0BD3B00A0C911CE86code implemented in code.Netcode with the help of an edited version of the code available here a hrefhttpwww.codeproject.comArticles421167PureNETDirectShowFiltersinCsharp relnofollowPure .Net DirectShow Filtersa by Maxim Kartavenkov.p  pI need to get codeffmpegcode to recognize my code.Netcode DirectShow filter as a video source using Registration Free COM Side by Side  sxs. Built into the code.Netcode framework is support for COM component servers, so theoretically as long as the manifests are correct, codeffmpegcode should detect the filters.p  pHere is a snippet of the relevant sections of my manifest files currently.p  precodelt FFMPEG MANIFEST gt ltxml version1.0 encodingUTF8 standaloneyesgt ltassembly manifestVersion1.0 xmlnsurnschemasmicrosoftcomasm.v1 xmlnsasmv1urnschemasmicrosoftcomasm.v1 xmlnsasmv2urnschemasmicrosoftcomasm.v2 xmlnsasmv3urnschemasmicrosoftcomasm.v3gt ltassemblyIdentity nameffmpeg.exe version1.0.0.0 typewin32 processorArchitecturegt ltdependencygt  ltdependentAssembly asmv2codebaseDShowVideoFilter.manifestgt   ltassemblyIdentity nameDShowVideoFilter version1.0.0.0 publicKeyToken26A05D7C90FBA3E8gt  ltdependentAssemblygt ltdependencygt ltassemblygt codepre  pbrp  precodelt DIRECTSHOW FILTER MANIFEST gt ltxml version1.0 encodingUTF8 standaloneyesgt ltassembly xmlnsurnschemasmicrosoftcomasm.v1 manifestVersion1.0gt    ltassemblyIdentity nameDShowVideoFilter version1.0.0.0 publicKeyToken26A05D7C90FBA3E8 gt    ltclrClass       clsid65722BE634494628ABD374B6864F9739       progidDShowVideoFilter.VideoCaptureFilter       threadingModelBoth       runtimeVersionv2.0.50727gt    ltfile nameDShowVideoFilter.dllgt    ltfilegt    ltfile nameDShowVideoFilter.tlbgt      lttypelib         tlbidB618E67B64C848E99F94F13214B76808         version1.0         helpdir         flagshasdiskimagegt    ltfilegt ltassemblygt codepre  pSo, I get no errors when running codeffmpegcode like you would if there was a manifest error  and I am confident that everything that is configured correctly related to traditional sxs com loading, the problem I think unconfirmed is that codeffmpegcode loads DShow filters via DirectShows intelligent connect system, which requires the filter and pins to be registered. Here are some documents that talk about how filters need to be registered that Ive found p  ul lia hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms924596.aspx relnofollow1 Registering DirectShow Filtersali lia hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopdd376682vvs.85.aspx relnofollow2 Implementing DllRegisterServerali ul  pNow, in Maxim Kartavenkovs DShow base classes, he takes care of 2 automatically.

Positive 162 pSharePoint Online has a mostly undocumented method of populating a list of SharePoint Online sites that an administrator pushes out to its users.

Positive 162 pWhat i want to do is set the Windows Media Players volume level.

Additional i dont know whether this would work at all.p  pPoint 3 has the presupposition that one can get an instance of a COM element by a handle. Since i have yet not worked with COM elements i dont know if this is possible.br bUpdateb One can get an instance of a remote mediay player using the codeIWMPPlayer4code interface.

Negative 162 pI would like to write a plugin that will allow a custom written CRM to read and write to their local Outlook client.  I know that this poses a security concern.  But, my clients are asking that their CRM be connected to Outlook.  They would like to be able to do the followingp  pA When a contact sends them an email reply or free standing email, theyd like the details of this email to go INTO the CRM.  Yep.  They would like me to save the body, time and date it was sent, etc.br  B They want to be able to send new emails or replies to existing emails from within the CRM itself.  Basically, a form that looks like Outlooks sendreply email form.br  C Want the ability to search for contacts and the related emails with a search for tagskeywords facility.  i.e. if a product name or code appears in an email then they want the email returned in the search. D Having performed a search of many contacts, they will want to prepare a mailer and shoot out some sort of email announcement to their qualified leads.  This could be 50, 100, or more persons.  So its got to be able to allow bulk mailing. E Given a list of new prospects, that arent currently contacts in the CRM, they will want to do the same and if they get replies from this mailer to the prospects, the will want the replies to be saved in the DB and contacts be inserted into the DB. F They would like to be able to utilize the calendar and task list facilities of Outlook from the CRM, as well.p  pMore or less, they want this pretty basic as it is today CRM that I created to integrate with Outlook and have it do so seamlessly as if it was an addon to the CRM.  A plugin is what I am thinking...p  pBut, I dont know where to begin.  My environment is Windows XPVista and is going to be ASP.NET and I am going to use the VB.NET language to accomplish this.  What do I need  Are there resources out there that can describe how to build a plugin to Outlook as I have been asked to  This is not Exchange, none of the clients use exchange not so far.  They all run Outlook.  Mostly 2003.  Most clients are XP right now but some are upgrading to Vista.p  pFor some reason I cant seem to wrap my head around this. I think the whole security issue is thwarting my ability to see past what is probably a simple thing.  The client doesnt want to be prompted by any security messages asking them if they are sure they want to send 382 emails to their contacts.  Not once and certainly not 382 times.p  pWhere do I begin  Ive searched the internet for similar but mainly what I found are alreadywritten products and Ive got to write this from scratch.  p
Negative 162 pPart of the series of controls I am working on obviously involves me lumping some of them together in to composites. I am rapidly starting to learn that this takes consideration this is all new to me p  pI basically have a codeStyledWindowcode control, which is essentially a glorified codePanelcode with ability to do other bits like add borders etc.p  pHere is the code that instantiates the child controls within it. Up till this point it seems to have been working correctly with mundane static controlsp  precode    protected override void CreateChildControls              panel  new Panel          if editable  null             editable.InstantiateInpanel          regions  new ListltIAttributeAccessorgt         regions.Addpanel      codepre  pThe problems came today when I tried nesting a more complex control within it. This control uses a reference to the page since it injects JavaScript in to make it a bit more snappy and responsive the codeRegisterClientScriptBlockcode is the only reason I need the page ref.p  pNow, this was causing object null errors, but I localized this down to the render method, which was of course trying to call the method against the [null] codePagecode object.p  pWhats confusing me is that the control works fine as a standalone, but when placed in the codeStyledWindowcode it all goes horribly wrongp  pstrongSo, it looks like I am missing something in either my codeStyledWindowcode or codeChildControlcode. Any ideasstrongp  h2Updateh2  pAs a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions127794childcontrolinitializationincustomcompositeinaspnet127824Brad Wilsona quite rightly pointed out, you do not see the controls being added to the codeControlscode collection.

Apologies.p  h2Update Following a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions127794childcontrolinitializationincustomcompositeinaspnet128299Longhorn213s Answerah2  pRight, I have been doing some playing with the control, placing one within the composite, and one outside. I then got the status of Page at event major event in the control Lifecycle and rendered it to the page.p  pThe standalone is working fine and the page is inited as expected. However, the one nested in the Composite is different. Its codeOnLoadcode event is not being fired at all So I am guessing Brad is probably right in that I am not setting up the control hierarchy correctly, can anyone offer some advice as to what I am missing Is the Panel method not enough well, it obviously isnt is it Dp  pThanks for your help guys, appreciated p

Negative 162 pOur product contains a taskmanager system that allows applications to run code in a DLL upon a scheduled interval, specify rules about whether a failure of the task should disable the related application, etc. Mostly its used for dataupload, datadownload, local database maintenance, etc. One of the functions used is to sync the devices time via NTP and set the OS timezone info. For this, we use OpenNetCFs DateTimeHelper class, which seems to serve as a wrapper around Win32 PInvokes.p  pOne of the other features of the task manager is that if a task runs longer than its allotted time window, the task manager will Thread.Abort it to allow other tasks to run.

Since the SSN is encrypted with a salt value, I cant do a lookup without looking at each row.p  pI only want 1 user account per SSN.

I am not really that worried about the amount of disk space on their machine as we are working with terabyte storage values.p  pHaving said all of that I have been poking around in the docs and am wondering if I need to invest some time to learn and implement an alternative data storage file.  The only reason I can think of is if there is an alternative that could increase the lookup speed by a factor of three to five or more.p

It also seems like Target might be the property to set  but it gives me a pick list  and my .exe is not in the list of things to pick. p  pThanks,p  pNeal Walters p  pemstrongUpdate 1emstrong p  pIm using VS2008 SP1. p  pI added a folder under Users Program menu called RCT thats my application name.  I right click on that folder and I see Add with an arrow to submenu and Create shortcut to RCT.  The first thing I tried was the Create shortcut to RCT, which is what lead me to post this question. Once the shortcut is there, it looks like the Properties Windows is the only way to configure it.  I set the Target, and Working Folder all 3 properties to Application Folder.  Now when I click the shortcut, it opens disk directory CUsersuxnxw01AppDataRoamingMicrosoftWindowsStart MenuProgramsRCT p  pIf I right click on Users Program Menu I see a link Add shortcut to users program menu.  I really want a shortcut in the users program menu, not to the users program menu. p  pThe Add submenu has four options Folder, Project Output, File, Assembly. p  pemstrongSOLUTION  based on Heinzis responseemstrong p  pI think I got it now  you rightclick on the white space under name ... type... not on the folder. Then I see create new shortcut. What a confusing design on the part of Microsoft Seems like you would click on the folder and add new shortcut. Instead they give you Add shortcut to... the item you click on.p

Negative 162 pI have a bitmap and would like to return an iterator of positions of set bits. Right now I just walk the whole bitmap and if bit is set, then I provide next position.

This cant be done for a whole int, because array would be too big. But maybe there are some better solutions Do you know any smart algorithms for thisp

Negative 162 pI am trying to make my own Jabber bot but i have run into a little trouble.  I have gotten my bot to respond to messages, however, if I try to change the bots presence then it seems as though all of the messages you send to the bot get delayed.  p  pWhat I mean is when I run the script I change the presence so I can see that it is online.  Then when I send it a message it takes three before the callback subroutine I have set up for messages gets called.  After the thirrd message is sent and the chat subroutine is called it still process the first message I sent.  p  pThis really doesnt pose too much of a problem except that I have it set up to log out when I send the message logout and it has to be followed by two more messages in order to log out.  I am not sure what it is that I have to do to fix this but i think it has something to do with iq packets because I have an iq callback set as well and it gets called two times after setting the presence.p  pHere is my source codep  pre usrbinperl  use strict use warnings  Libraries use NetJabber use DBI use DBDmysql   Config Vars   Jabber Client my jbrHostname  DOMAINNAME  my jbrUserName  USERNAME my jbrPassword  PASSWORD my jbrResource  RESOURCE my jbrBoss  new NetJabberJID jbrBossSetJIDuseridUSERNAME,serverjbrHostname   MySQL my dbHostname  DOMAINNAME my dbName  DATABASENAME my dbUserName  USERNAME my dbPassword  PASSWORD  End Config    connect to the db my dbh  DBIconnectDBImysqldatabasedbNamehostdbHostname,dbUserName, dbPassword, RaiseError  1 or die Couldnt connect to the database n   create a new jabber client and connect to server my jabberBot  NetJabberClientnew my status  jabberBotConnecthostnamejbrHostname or die Cannot connect n my results  jabberBotAuthSendusernamejbrUserName,passwordjbrPassword,resourcejbrResource  ifresults[0] ne ok      die Jabber auth error resultsn    set jabber bot callbacks jabberBotSetMessageCallBackschatchat jabberBotSetPresenceCallBacksavailablewelcome jabberBotSetCallBacksiqgotIQ  jabberBotPresenceSendtypeavailable jabberBotProcess1  sub welcome      jabberBotMessageSendtojbrBossGetJID,subject,bodyHello There,typechat,priority10     keepItGoing   jabberBotMessageSendtojbrBossGetJID,subject,bodyHello There Global...,typechat,priority10 jabberBotProcess5 keepItGoing  sub chat      print Chat Calledn     my sessionID,msg       jabberBotMessageSendtomsgGetFrom,subject,bodyChatting,typechat,priority10     ifmsgGetBody ne logout              print msgGetBody.n         keepItGoing          else              killBotmsg         sub gotIQ      print [1]GetID.n     chat   sub keepItGoing      print Movin the chainsn     my proc  jabberBotProcess1     whiledefinedproc  proc  1              proc  jabberBotProcess1        sub killBot      jabberBotMessageSendto[0]GetFrom,subject,bodyLogging Out,typechat,priority10     jabberBotProcess1     jabberBotDisconnect     exit  pre  pThanks for your helpp

Negative 162 pI have a test setup where I have many very similar unit tests that I need to run. For example, there are about 40 stored procedures that need to be checked for existence in the target environment. However Id like all the tests to be grouped by their business unit. So thered be 40 instances of a very similar TestMethod in 40 separate classes. Kinda lame. One other thing each group of tests need to be in their own solution. So Business Unit A will have a solution called Tests.BusinessUnitA. p  pIm thinking that I can set this all up by passing a configuration object with the name of the stored proc to check, among other things to a TestRunner class. p  pThe problem is that Im losing the atomicity of my unit tests. I wouldnt be able to run just one of the tests, Id have to run all the tests in the TestRunner class. p  pThis is what the code looks like at this time. Sure, its nice and compact, but if Test 8 fails, I have no way of running just Test 8.  p  precode  TestRunner runner  new TestRunnerconfig, this.TestContext    var runnerType  typeofTestRunner   var methods  runnerType.GetMethods      .Wherex gt         x.GetCustomAttributestypeofTestMethodAttribute, false        .Count gt 0.ToArray        foreach var method in methods               method.Invokerunner, null        codepre  pSo Im looking for suggestions for making a group of unit tests that take in a configuration object but wont require me to generate many many TestMethods.

Negative 162 pIve studied some simple semantic network implementations and basic techniques for parsing natural language.

I then would like this gateway to run a http or https command to populate a database located within our domain. The end game is that this txt creates a request that initiates a workflow. p  pNow, I dont yet have a full requirements spec other than the fact that we will have to use a mobile to initiate the workflow as access to the internet will not always be guaranteed we are operating in some of the most remote and hostile environments on old mother earth.p  pHas anyone used any sms service that is both simple and inexpensive and more importantly, isnt tied to a contract that involves requiring 000s of txts per month this will at most have 1020 txts per day, so not a money spinner for the mobilegateway owner.p  pWe will be implementing the domain side in .net and are comfortable in that technology. So whether the http message is xmljson or simple querystring parameters, were not concerned. The main concern is that we have recommendations for a robust service gateway that receives messages and runs the http command in any format that we specify. p  pLooking fwd to suggestions and thoughts.p  pstrong[update]strong  our preferred service provider would be UK based as the operation would be very much driven by UK daylight hoursp

Negative 162 pHey,  Im working a lot with Visual Studio 2008, .NET C 2.03.5 and Windows Forms and I have noticed, like many before me, that GDI is extremely slow in drawing Controls. strongNotestrong that I do not deal with images JPG, GIF etc very much. Images are only as icons in certain places. This is actually ControlsFormsetc that are slow to draw.p  pThe issue is that you can see Controls being drawn and it can take several seconds for a seemingly easy set of Controls to be drawn. Ie, its lagging and horrible. p  pI have made tests where I just put a number of Labels 4050 on a form, hitting F5 to run and have to wait for them to be drawn. Again, lag and not a very nice experience.p  pSo, then there is WPF that might address this problem, but Iwe are not ready to move to WPF. So Im looking around for workarounds or fixes and I stumbled upon Direct2D, and when reading on that some other libraries.p  pstrongPut Im a tad puzzled and thus these questionsstrongp  pstrong1strong  First of, what I want is a fairly neat and simple way to just emreplaceem GDI with something faster and hardware accelerated approach. emIs it possible to do that without going over to WPF and without having to rewrite all my Windows Forms codeemp  pWhenever I read anything on Direct2D I see long blocks of usually horrible C code, telling me on how to manually write code to for drawing. I do not want that.p  pstrong2strong  While reading on the net, I stumbled upon SlimDX, but I cannot figure out how to use it and I admit, I havent tried very much as of writing. Lets say I already have a GUIapplication Windows Forms, standard C code  can I somehow use SlimDX or something like it to just replace GDI without too much rewritingp  pMy problem is I cannot find any examples or such telling me if it is possible to use SlimDX, Direct2D or other similiar things in my alreadycreated Windows Forms software, and if it is possible  how to do it.p  pHope Im not too fuzzy p  pstrongEDIT 20100922strongp  pI have made some tests in my real app, and isolated one of the slow things to thisp  pWhen I add text to some Labels in a UserControl, the Controls resize themselves to fit the text. For example, the containing GroupControl adapts a bit to the size of the text that was just added to the .Textproperty of the Labels. p  pThere are about 10 Label controls. The first time the labels are updated, and thus sizes are changed, the whole process takes about 500 ms. The second time the labels are updated, and emnoem size changes, it takes about 0 ms.p  pstrongEDIT 2 20100922strongp  pFound one of the slowdowns. Then adding a String to the Textproperty it is slow if the text that is being added differs in string emlengthem from the text that was there before the update.p  pIm using DevExpress libraries, and the LabelControls can be set to AutoSizeMode. If I set that to None then the lag will go away when adding text that differs in length from the previous text. I guess this problem will be the same for the normal Labelcontrol as it also has a AutoSize  truefalse setting.p  pHowever, its a workaround but still proves my point  its really slow when resizing which is pretty lame.p

Negative 162 pI have some commercial equipment that I can connect to with a .Net library supplied by the equipment manufacturer  so I have no control over the library or the equipment, only my code.p  pThe manufacturer has set their system up so that if you are not connected to the equipment via their library then it works fine.  However, when you do connect with their library there is an implicit requirement that you service Windows message pump at a rate set by how fast the equipment is running.   This is because their library implements an event system that you can subscribe to that tracks operation of the equipment, but they assume that your application code will be WinForms based.  But there is nothing explicitly stating this in their documentation  only that all 2 of their .Net example programs are WinForms based.  I have confirmed with their tech support that the expectation is that you will use a WinForms application.p  pIn my case I am writing a C, nonWinForms based application actually a Windows Service, so I do not have a UI thread and even though I am connecting to the equipment I am not subscribing to any of the events.   As a result I have found that I need reference the WinForms assembly and call Application.DoEvents  at a fast enough rate to service all of those events that I do not subscribe to.p  pSo my questions are these  p  ol liIn this case is calling Application.DoEvents my only optionli liOr is there a more modern way of doing thisli liWhat are the ramifications of calling DoEvents on a 20mS rateli liUnrelated, but if I wrote a WPF based application would that program be likely to service the message pumpli ol  pstrongEditstrongp  pI should add that if you connect to the equipment and do not service the windows message pump even if not subscribed to any of their events, then the equipment falls starts to behave unpredictably.p  pstrongEdit 2strongp  pAlso the thread I use to interface to the library is about 2 or 3 generations removed from the initial windows service thread.p

Negative 162 pI have been making a database and learning along the way. I recently got into using InnoDB and using foreign keys to connect tables together.p  pBut in all honestly Im probably making my foreign keys blindly. What is the correct set and check list that I need to use when making a foreign key.p  pMy understanding with foreign keys is that I have a Master Table, and any changes in my Master Table are reflected to any tables that hold a foreign key to a specific column in it.p  pSo my current login system has a set up like thisp  precodeusers  id PK username password codepre  pand my other tables look like thisp  precodecontacts  id PK userid references users.id group name address  groups  id PK userid groupname  groupcontacts  id PK groupid references group.id contactid references contacts.id codepre  pTo my understanding these tables can be deleted when the Master Table is deleted using the ON DELETE CASCADE option correctp  pMy problem now is that I cant seem to make codegroupidcode and codecontactidcode a Foreign key to codegroupscode.codeidcode and codecontactscode.codeidcode with this setup. I get an error when running the SQL statements.p  pIm trying to make my address book so that when a user places a contact into a group becomes all automated and I dont have to change much information. The codegroupcontactcode table is what I THINK I will querying when I want to see where each contact belongs to. If I change the name of a group it will reflect across all tables right This is where foreign keys come in and Im confusing myself with how these keys should behave for me.p  pBut like I said I cant seem to make a foreign key without getting an error.p  pI know I can Google my Foreign Key question, which I have but I cant seem to learn this way without getting feedback and input to my exact scenario p  pNot to ask too much but because of my confusion Im also having a hard time trying to see how I can make a PHP script to handle the group name change and query the database to pull down contacts that belong to a specific group.p  pThis would really help me a lot guys, and I hope to learn somethingp  pMy query is thisp  precodeALTER TABLE list.groupscontacts     ADD CONSTRAINT groupid

Negative 162 pThe one thing that can still get me is what to return from methods I know that you should be as specific as possibleie dont return object if you need to return an int p  pHowever its cases like thisp  pI have a service layer that contains business logic.  Say I have a method called CreateAnEventp  pBasically it saves an event to the database and if successful it will return a string with saved to databasep  pNow what happens if I first need to check if this event meets some business rules.p  ol liCant be less than todays date.li liCant be greater than one week from today.li liCant be created on a Friday.li ol  pSomething like that where I need to first do some business checks that could either lead to validation errors or maybe some sort of other errormaybe even an exception or a success message still gets me what I should be returning.p  pSo lets go first with validation. Say the user fails all these validation rules what now I am returning a string so this wont be pretty I going to have to use csv to return all the errors and parse them out.p  pSo that just seems very bad. p  pI could first have a separate method called Validate but now I have to remember to call this before I call CreateAnEvent. So I dont think this is that great.p  pI am using ViewModels in my mvc project so maybe I should pass the entire viewModel to the service layer and then return this ViewModel.p  pIn this view model I could have a collection of Errors that I could add all these errors to as well as a string to contain a success message.p  pOnce it gets returned just do a check first for errors if count is zero then assume success msg is filled.p  pI am not returning the most specific type back but it would solve my problem. However I dont think the service layer should know anything about a viewModel. p  pI know some people do the validation in the viewmodel but I consider that more for basic non business logic rules like is a field blank or not. I dont think I should be doing testing like I described above in a viewmodel.p  pSo the last option I can think of is send in the Domain Modelthat would be in a viewmModel since there is a good chance I would be using it in the view and in this Domain Model I would add a string for success messages and a collection for errors.p  pI would then return this domain model.p  pSo it basically same idea as using ViewModels but this time extracting out the domain model and using it.p  pSo is this the best way to do it or are there better waysp
Negative 162 pIm starting to develop a GWT application which will have 500 plus users with various roles and the main functionality centered on RPC calls to watch how data is changing on the server. Think of a system for watching stocks which change every 20 seconds. In addition, the users will also be viewing graphs and charts of the changing data which are generated on a daily basis.p  pI have looked at SmartGWT and the samples on their showcase page. I have also tried building a prototype of the application using smartgwt. So far my biggest worry is debugging the application which some times refers to some error in the javascript end of the library. I havent touched yet ExtGWT which also looks promising. p  pSo what library would you recommend for such a scenario and is it worthwile to use any of them if you want to develop something relatively fast. Also I would like to know if the libraries are good performance wise in handling graphing and huge data sets 4 tables each with at least 100 rows.p  pAlso Im planning to build the security using the Access Control List package of springsecurity since the users will have to be assigned roles through a web interface. Is the package well suited for this and what tradeoffs will I have to make when using these technologies I want to get it right the first time rather than have to refactor or migrate to another library later on, so suggestions are highly appreciated.p

Negative 162 pI have a SplitView iPad application and I fixed the selections in the popover RootViewController to be static, lets say red, yellow, and blue.

You could hover and then it would eventually connect to View ultimately the UITableView.  Ive tried everything and I cannot get a simple delegate and datasource controller with a simple NSArray to populate the DetailViewControllers table view from RootViewControllers didSelectRowAtIndexPath.

Negative 162 pIn the last few days Ive been reading about Backbone.js and how it simplifies JS code interaction with View elements, basically within HTML. Ive also read about the differences between KnockoutJS and Backbone.js.

Essentially requiring us to code another set of Models in Backbone or Knockout. As I understand, with KnockoutJS this is even more prevalent, thats why I thought I will choose Backbone but now I think it is not that different  after a few examples I saw that same duplication is becoming evident.p  pAlso how do we maintain such an application if for instance we already have a bunch of MVC Partial Views and now we are supposed to recreate them in Backbone using some templating engine like JQuery templatesp

Negative 162 pcodePipedInputStreamcode and codePipedOutputStreamcode are used for interthread data transfers. Data is read from a codePipedInputStreamcode object by one thread and data is written to the corresponding codePipedOutputStreamcode by some other thread.p  pSo far, so good. One potential benefit I see from this paradigm is that a sporadic producer codeOutputStreamcode does not need to be slowed down by a slow consumer codeInputStreamcode. In other words, in times when the codeOutputStreamcode suddenly produces a great amount of data that the consumer is not able to consume right away, the codeOutputStreamcode does not need to wait for the produced data to be fully consumed before getting on with its life.p  pQuestion 1 Is my understanding correct Is this one of the benefits of this PipedStreams constructp  pIf the answer to Question 1 is yes, thenp  pThis works well when the buffer is not full, but when the buffer is full, in JDK6s implementation, the PipedOutputStream blocks and waits for more space to free up. This beats the purpose that I mentioned above, doesnt itp  pThe issue seems to be very easy to solve by changing the behavior in cases of full bufferes from waiting for new space to allocating a bigger buffer. I can probably implement one in a couple of minutes, but Id hate to reinvent the wheel if something like that is already available out there. I googled around quite a bit, but couldnt find any however, which is quite surprising to me.p  pCan someone point me to the right direction Or point out where Im wrong in my thinkingp  pThanksp

Negative 162 pBefore I start, our customers have to connect through AFDS to be able to go on the CRM 2011.  So we are talking about an IFDenvironment.p  pIm having a problem when using the CRM 2011 Outlook Client and the Window.OpenJS function. When they hit a button in the CRM 2011 an ASPXpage fires up and does some stuff with an attachment in the email.  It then creates successfully a contact and then afterwards it should redirect to that Contactpage.  But each time I do a redirect to a CRM 2011page, the user is prompt for his credentials.  Thats because the Window.Open opens the screen in an new Browserscreen and the authentication is lost because we come from the outlook client.p  pThe above scenario works fine when using the Webbased CRM 2011, because you need first to login via ADFS.p  pHave some of you encountered the above problem and have a great solution to this p  ol liIs there a way to do a Window.Open and stay in an Outlookscreen  The same as you should doubleclick a contact in the CRM 2011 Outlook Clientli liIs there a way while doing a Redirect, I can automatically give the credentials to the page, so that it will page will be opened without that the user himself need to enter his credentials Ive read something about SignInRequestMessage and FederatedAuthentication, but no clear examples were shown to do this.li ol  pIm hoping that you guys can help me out.  At my side, if I find any resolution, I will come back herep  pKind Regards, Fredericp
Negative 162 pIn an attempt to rid my GUI of race conditions and deadlocks I have the following function which I call from the ctor and whenever I need the service which shares my named codemutexcode to provide its inputp  pre classlangcpp prettyprintoverridecodevoid EnvCaptFireServiceAndOrHold      try          mutTimerSyncExgtReleaseMutex         ThreadSleep100 Time enough for the service to complete.         if mutTimerSyncExgtWaitOne3  intms intms  the polling period             Mustve been doubly locked or worse.             mutTimerSyncExgtReleaseMutex             FireServiceAndOrHold               catch Exception  ex          Released unheld mutex.

Before I attempt to reorder things I would like to know what is going wrong with the above function. The error I get isp  blockquote   pObject synchronization method was called from an unsynchronized block of code.p blockquote  pBecause calling release on a codemutexcode that hasnt been codeWaitOnecoded will throw I catch that, knowing I am free to take ownership of it and continue.

It is not touching the mutex.p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pIve attempted the reordering I first suggested, this seemed good but now I find that the mutex is only sort of Global, despite having a Globalname.p  ul lipIt emisem shared because when my GUI ctors it codefirstInstancecode is false, hence I attempt to take control of it.pli lipIt is emnotem shared because when the GUI calls codeWaitOnecode on it the GUI blocks indefinitely.

Negative 162 pI have a CWinAppbased application that is built as a DLL that is loaded by another 3rd party application as a plugin.  My app exposes an exported StartPlugin method that creates a CDialog derived dialog.  This exported function is somehow called by the 3rd party application.  Id like to be able to run my DLL outside of the 3rd party application so I can test and play around with UI stuff not for unit testing.  p  pHow can I create a test harness that will allow me to run my dll code  Im not sure how the main application launches my dll plugin, but Im speculating that its creating a UserInterface thread  So would I just need to create a simple exe that can somehow load my dll and create a new thread or something.

Negative 162 pI have a program that needs to run a function M times per iteration, and those runs can be parallelized. Lets say Im limited to running N threads at a time say by the number of cores available. I need an algorithm that will make sure Im always running N threads so long as the number of threads remaining is  N and that algorithm needs to be invariant to the completion order of those threads. Also, the thread scheduling algorithm should not claim significant CPU time.  p  pI have something like the following in mind, but its clearly flawed.p  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt include ltpthread.hgt include ltcstdlibgt  void findnumvoid arg      double num  rand     fordouble q0 1 q         ifnum  q                      stdcout ltlt n             return 0             int main       srand0      const int N  2     pthreadt threads [N]     forint q0 qltN q         pthreadcreateampthreads [q], NULL, findnum, NULL      int M  30     int launchedN     int finnished0     while1              forint w0 wltN w                      inefficient if threads [1] done before threads [2]             pthreadjoin threads [w], NULL             finnished             stdcout ltlt n ltlt finnished             iffinnished  M                 break             iflaunched lt M                              pthreadcreateampthreads [w], NULL, findnum, NULL                 launched                                iffinnished  M             break       codepre  pThe obvious problem here is that if codethreads[1]code finishes before codethreads[0]code there is wasted CPU time, and I cant think of how to get around that. Also, Im assuming that having the main routine waiting on codepthreadjoincode is not a significant drain on CPU timep

I succeeded.p  pNow the next step I want to use a Vertex Buffer Object to do the same thing.p  pSo I added thisp  ol lipnew varsp  pprivate int[] mVBOid  new int[2]       2 ids needed for VBO and index buffer oject private ShortBuffer mIndices            indices usedpli lipadded code to create the VBOp  precode    ByteBuffer vbb  ByteBuffer.allocateDirect             triangleCoords.length  SIZEOFFLOAT      vbb.orderByteOrder.nativeOrder use the device hardwares native byte order     mTriangleVB  vbb.asFloatBuffer   create a floating point buffer from the ByteBuffer     mTriangleVB.puttriangleCoords     add the coordinates to the FloatBuffer     mTriangleVB.position0             set the buffer to read the first coordinate      ByteBuffer ibb  ByteBuffer.allocateDirect             indices.length  SIZEOFSHORT     ibb.orderByteOrder.nativeOrder  use the device hardwares native byte order     mIndices  ibb.asShortBuffer      create a short buffer from the ByteBuffer     mIndices.putindices               add the indices to the Buffer     mIndices.position0                set the buffer to read the first index      GLES20.glGenBuffers2, mVBOid, 0      GLES20.glBindBufferGLES20.GLARRAYBUFFER, mVBOid[0]     GLES20.glBufferDataGLES20.GLARRAYBUFFER,             numComponentsPerVertex  SIZEOFFLOAT,             mTriangleVB,             GLES20.GLSTATICDRAW      GLES20.glBindBufferGLES20.GLELEMENTARRAYBUFFER, mVBOid[1]     GLES20.glBufferDataGLES20.GLELEMENTARRAYBUFFER,             mNumIndices  SIZEOFSHORT,             mIndices,             GLES20.GLSTATICDRAW codepreli lipadded code to draw the geometryp  precode    GLES20.glBindBufferGLES20.GLARRAYBUFFER, mVBOid[0]     GLES20.glVertexAttribPointermaPositionHandle, nc, GLES20.GLFLOAT, false, stride, 0     GLES20.glEnableVertexAttribArraymaPositionHandle      GLES20.glBindBufferGLES20.GLELEMENTARRAYBUFFER, mVBOid[1]     GLES20.glDrawElementsGLES20.GLTRIANGLEFAN, mNumIndices, GLES20.GLUNSIGNEDSHORT, 0 codepreli ol  pNote As the firstly implemented new functionality to render the geometry using glDrawElements without using VBO is working, I know that the mTriangleVB and mIndices variables are correctly filled with the data needed. Also maPositionHandle and muMVPMatrixHandle are correct. In my code I check for GL errors  none are foundp  pMy problem the VBO technique is not working nothing is seen on the screen, except of the clear color. In a more complex application I get more problemsp  ul lipother geometries without using VBOs which were rendered correctly are invisible, when a VBO based geometry is introducedpli lipsegmentation faults are reported occasionaly. Trying to get the exact cause I commented out a lot of code, and finally found, that the crash occurs even if the geometry is not rendered at all. The reason of the crash must be the initialization of the VBO  although the crash occurs not immediately, but some time later.br But I still cant figure out why it is not working.pli ul  pHeres some more informationp  ol lipMy Environmentp  ul liAndroid 2.3.3li liBuild Target Android 2.3.3li liAndroid SDK Tools Rev. 15li liAndroid SDK Platform Tools Rev. 9li liDevice Huawei Ideos X3 Smartphoneli ulli lipThe complete Source for the SimpleOpenGLES20Renderer class.br The code is based on this samplebr a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comresourcestutorialsopenglopengles20.htmlhttpdeveloper.android.comresourcestutorialsopenglopengles20.htmla  pli ol  pcodep  precodepackage com.hugo.simplegles20  import java.nio.ByteBuffer import java.nio.ByteOrder import java.nio.FloatBuffer import java.nio.ShortBuffer  import javax.microedition.khronos.egl.EGLConfig import javax.microedition.khronos.opengles.GL10  import android.opengl.GLES20 import android.opengl.GLSurfaceView import android.opengl.Matrix import android.util.Log   public class SimpleOpenGLES20Renderer implements GLSurfaceView.Renderer       public float mAngle      static String TAG  SimpleTest      final int SIZEOFFLOAT  Float.SIZE  8     final int SIZEOFSHORT  Short.SIZE  8       private int[] mVBOid  new int[2]       2 ids needed for VBO and index buffer oject       enum TestType          USEARRAY,           almost the original code         USEELEMENTS,        rendering, using glDrawElements call         USEVBOELEMENTS     using a vertex buffer object VBO          private TestType mUsage  TestType.USEVBOELEMENTS       private boolean mFourComponents  true      private int mNumIndices  0      private FloatBuffer mTriangleVB     private ShortBuffer mIndices     private final String vertexShaderCode            This matrix member variable provides a hook to manipulate          the coordinates of the objects that use this vertex shader         uniform mat4 uMVPMatrix   n           attribute vec4 vPosition  n          void main               n            the matrix must be included as a modifier of glPosition          glPosition  uMVPMatrix  vPosition n             n      private final String fragmentShaderCode           precision mediump float  n          void main              n           glFragColor  vec4 0.63671875, 0.76953125, 0.22265625, 1.0 n                                   n      private int mProgram      private int maPositionHandle      private int muMVPMatrixHandle      private float[] mMVPMatrix  new float[16]     private float[] mMMatrix  new float[16]     private float[] mVMatrix  new float[16]     private float[] mProjMatrix  new float[16]      public static void checkGLErrorString msg          int e  GLES20.glGetError         if e  GLES20.GLNOERROR              Log.dTAG, GLES20 ERROR   msg     e             Log.dTAG, errStringe                   public static String errStringint ec          switch ec          case GLES20.GLNOERROR             return No error has been recorded.         case GLES20.GLINVALIDENUM             return An unacceptable value is specified for an enumerated argument.         case GLES20.GLINVALIDVALUE             return A numeric argument is out of range.         case GLES20.GLINVALIDOPERATION             return The specified operation is not allowed in the current state.         case GLES20.GLINVALIDFRAMEBUFFEROPERATION             return The command is trying to render to or read from the framebuffer               while the currently bound framebuffer is not framebuffer complete i.e.               the return value from glCheckFramebufferStatus is not               GLFRAMEBUFFERCOMPLETE.         case GLES20.GLOUTOFMEMORY             return There is not enough memory left to execute the command.

Negative 162 pI have a good design on my website and i suddenly realized my design does not render pretty well in internet explorer 7 and 8, i tried all that i can but i still cannot fix it and i dont like how its displaying in those browsers so i decided to add exception on the design configuration coumn by adding codeMSIE 7.0code and then value of defaul, tested with internet explorer 7 and it works well but my problem is that my custom theme has some large images and texts and other materials that were aligned nicely with css but once i changed the theme to default and it does not see those css, they also just display anyhow and its really a pain for me, all that i need to do now is find a way to make the default theme load with a different cms page instead of the normal homepage for my main theme. i dont know if i can do that but i need some little help or guide to go about it.p  pI followed your guide and have created the files and now i can see the welspot template under the design field.p  pNow i need to still use the old homepage the one i have installed with the hellowired theme, i want to copy magento default theme into my package now and edit it but i need to find a way to remove all the static blocks i created through maybe a layout file as i wont use those blocks in the default theme and even if possible add different images through xml so i would be using two themes with the same homepage but dynamic content based on the theme being used.p

But at the same time, I dont want to make a billion alertviews because that might get messy too.p

Negative 162 pI am trying to form a metric to model the following scenario.p  pGiven various combinations of triples of points calls those triples abc in euclidean space, where all points are moving independently over time. Lets imagine that each triple is connected by edges Ea,b and Eb,c, but no direct edge from ac. p  pI am looking to form an error metric, which penalises any changes in the length of edgea,b and edgeb,c and is locally scaled, but also considers the mean total distance walked from ac...such that those combinations of triples, whose relative scaled interconnected distances remains minimally unchanged and whose walk from ac is small has the largest metric value. p  pMy initial idea is obviously to calculate the standard deviation of edge lengths a,b and b,c and the mean abc.

Negative 162 pI am using Prism and MEF to create a WPF GUI. I am curious to know if there is a way to prepopulate WPF controls before a user views it.p  pSpecifically, I have a UserControl that uses a ListView to present a list of about 8000 items retrieved via network call over WCF.p  pI have determined that it is not the network call that is the bottleneck, but rather the creation of the ListView itself. The WPF ShellViewModel currently does a network prefetch so that all required data is present on the client side, but since I am using dependency injection with PrismMEF, the view does not get created until the user clicks on the Tab containing this ListView and subsequently freezes while the ListView is created populated with the 8K items. I suspect that LazyLoading of view dependencies has a part in this as well.p  pIs there a way to move this ListView creation to the bootstrapping phase of the application I would like the have this view loadedpopulated before the user clicks on it so that there is no lag.p  pReducing the number of items to be viewed is not an option.p  pThanks.p

Negative 162 pIm currently working on a .csv import which imports agenda items such as events and places them in a MySQL database. Ive got the gist of it working, there is however a troublesome piece of code which I cant seem to wrap my head around on how to fix it or make it more efficientbetter.p  pThe part of code which is troublesome for me is when a event is held every lets say codetuesdaycode and codesundaycode from code20120601code till code20130401code and you want to check if some of these values are allready in the DB because a user might import the .csv file again with some adjusted values. My current code eventually implements the correct values in to the DB, but the way it is done is kind of a hassle. If the file gets imported again all values from sunday get deleted again because my check goes through a foreach on tuesday first, where it will check if the DB values match with the values generated for tuesday. After the checks are done and the values are inserted into the DB my foreach checks all values for sunday tuesday does not get deleted because I keep an array with all previous inserted values and then inserts them again. So basically when I import a .csv file it removes and then inserts the same values, and my question is how would I prevent this p  pAlso, if you see any way to improve this code at all because I really feel its not efficient to begin with in the first place please say so, its much appreciated.p  pHere is the code that checks for the repetition of events, if you need any clarfication or other code please let me knowp  precodeREPEAT DAYS OF THE WEEK ifemptyrepeatDayOfTheWeek ampamp repeatDayOfTheWeek        daysOfTheWeek  explode,, repeatDayOfTheWeek      foreachdaysOfTheWeek as key gt dayOfTheWeek              ifisnumericdayOfTheWeek                      continue                   unsetagendaIgtagendaItemValues[stopDate]          beginDate  strtotimetempStartDate         endDate  strtotimetempStopDate          dayDates  array         arrayDatesInDb  array          ifissetpreviousInserts                      previousInserts  array                   ifbeginDate   ampamp endDate                        whilebeginDate lt endDate                              ifdateN, beginDate  dayOfTheWeek                                      dayDates[]  dateYmd, beginDate                                   beginDate  strtotime1 day, beginDate                       datesInDb  agendaIgtgetAgendaItemsByExternIdexternId          ifemptydatesInDb                      foreachdayDates as dayDate                              dumpEmpty DB  INSERT .dayDate                 agendaIgtsetAgendaItemValuestartDate, dayDate                 agendaIgtsaveAgendaItem                 previousInserts[]  dayDate                               else                      dumpDB with records             foreachdatesInDb as dateInDb                              ifinarraydateInDbgtstartDate, dayDates ampamp inarraydateInDbgtstartDate, previousInserts                                      dumpNot in Itemarray, but in DB  DELETE .dateInDbgtstartDate                     agendaIgtdeleteAgendaItemdateInDbgtid                                        foreachdayDates as dayDate                      foreachdatesInDb as dateInDb                              ifdayDate  dateInDbgtstartDate                                      arrayDatesInDb[]  dateInDbgtstartDate                     dumpIn array amp in DB  UPDATE .dateInDbgtstartDate                     agendaIgtsetAgendaItemValueid, dateInDbgtid                     agendaIgtsaveAgendaItem                     previousInserts[]  dayDate                                             unsetagendaIgtagendaItemValues[id]      foreachdayDates as dayDate              ifinarraydayDate, arrayDatesInDb                      dumpNot in DBarray but in Itemarray  INSERT .dayDate             agendaIgtsetAgendaItemValuestartDate, dayDate             agendaIgtsaveAgendaItem             previousInserts[]  dayDate                codepre  pThe following fields are in the .csvp  precodeDatum Tijdstip Evenement Locatie Website Toelichting Duits engels startdatum stopdatum herhalen dag van de week externid categorie via codepre  pstrongin other wordsstrongbr I need to check if the records in the DB are the same as in the .csv.

Negative 162 pI was wondering if this was possible. I have an AWS Elastic Load Balancer that currently has three servers behind it. Those three servers are inside of a VPC. What Im wondering is possible is if I can create a fourth server either inside or outside of the VPC and put that also behind the ELB to leverage the multiple servers CPU but then make that new server a private node only accesible to a certain IP Range. Id like to throw up another server that I can do server tweaks to for performance and speed that utilizes the ELB to balance CPU usage so I can test, and if that breaks it doesnt affect anybody.p

Negative 162 pDisclaimer Im not at all a skilled Jenkins user.p  pI was looking for a plugin to allow me to run only tests affected by the latest commits, in mavenbuilt projects, but could find neither a maven plugin smart enough to not run all tests again, nor a jenkins plugin doing this. Is there a way to achieve thisp  pSay, for example, I have a project consisting of A.java, testA.java, B.java and testB.java. I have jenkins configured to run a build and test for each commit. I have just commited a change to A.java, but not to B.Java, and theres no dependency from testB.java and B.java to A.java. I dont want Jenkins to run testB.java when it checks out fresh sources. If ther3e was a dependency from B.java or testB.java to A.java, Id like jenkins to figure this out, and run testB.java too.p  pBackground running all tests in a project is too time consuming. Running only a fixed set of tests leaves bug holes for bugs. Running all tests which might be broken by a change by hand is error prone.p

Negative 162 pThis is in asp.net mvc 3, however I think this situation is rather generic.p  pI have a partial view which is loaded from ajax as a preview.

Is there a better practice for accessing the state I know that checkmark will be available in the loaded view, and that the function that gets called after the loaded view goes away will be able to access an updated variable. However, it seems that this may not be best for readability.p  pIs this standard, is there a best practice in this situationp
Negative 162 pThis has been driving me crazy, though I suspect the answer may be simplep  pOne of our clients has a GeoTrust SSL certificate for their domain more details below, the problem is users on Windows XP arent getting that certificate in IE  we had to deploy an intermediary certificate for Firefox, so that may be why that works. Tried in IE 7 amp 8 and both are instead sent a selfsigned certificate, leading to a browsing error.p  pIE8 amp 9 on Win 7 are fine, they get sent the correct certificate and can view the site without any warnings. Its based on this that Im surmising its probably related to XP rather than the browser, though happy to be corrected.p  pAnyone got any idea why this might be happening Id assumed XP couldnt handle the 2048bit root cert, but Google suggests otherwise Ive installed the latest updates onto my test machine and it still seems to be receiving the wrong key.p  pGiven the nature of the site, installing a CA on users machines isnt an option, and the client wont be too happy if the answer is Theyll have to ignore it though obviously if thats what it comes down to...p  pstrongCertificate detailsstrongp  ul liIssued By GeoTrust DV SSL CA li liValid 1062012  1362012    li liCert signature algorithm PKCS 1 SHA1 with RSA    li liPub Key algorithm PKCS1 RSA    li liPub Key length 2048 bitsli ul  pstrongSelf Signedstrong p  ul liIssued by localhost.localdomainli liAlgorithm sha1RSAli liPub Key length 1024 bitsli ul  pUPDATE The client has just reported that they get the error in IE9 on Windows 7 too.

Output is printed to the CS5.5 output window and my FlashDevelop debugger is not attached.p  pWhat I would like to happen is when I hit Test Movie in the FlashDevelop debug configuration the CS5.5 IDE will build the project but then when the Swf launches in the flash player, the FlashDevelop debugger will attach and I will get output and breakpoints in FlashDevelop.p  pIs something like this feasible What steps would I need to take to configure CS5.5 and FlashDevelop this way if this isnt the default behaviour.

Negative 162 pSuppose a project is to use an old frozen version of Component1 say revision Rev1 but the current master version of all other files. Component1 is a directory in the same repository. p  pGITs whole fileset view seems to be awkward in this case. In CVS, one could simply put a sticky tag on Component1 to freeze those files at Rev1, or even branch there, while all other files would stay on the master branch.p  pThe repository is used for other projects that want the latest Component1 so we cant simply roll back the updates to Component1.p  pOne possibility is to create a branch at Rev1, but then one must constantly be merging in updates to all other files from master. Moreover, I have to be very careful on those merges to not accidentally merge any updates to Component1, which is easy to do in GIT because commits are by default automatic after a merge. p  pMapping Component1 in as a submodule would provide more control but in this case all files are sharing a common repository. p  pgit checkout ltrevgt  Component1 lets me pick a specific version of a component, but I cant commit that to master, or merge a branch into master that does such a revision selection, or else it will be exposed to all other projects.p  pAny other suggestions would be appreciated.p

Negative 162 pIm currently using the Pygments for PHP plugin that is located here a hrefhttpderek.simkowiak.netpygmentsforphp relnofollowhttpderek.simkowiak.netpygmentsforphpa. p  pThe line that actually calls Pygments from that code is an exec passed prepygmentize f html extraopts l language tempnamepre as the command. This all works fine, and I get back the output and it is formatted by the plugin.p  pWhat I would like to happen at the same time is for Pygments to create an image of it, so I pass exec a similar command prepygmentize f png extraopts l language o fullimagepathoutputfile.png tempnamepre This is where I run into a problem. The image never shows up in the expected folder.p  pHowever, if I codevardumpcode that command string before I codeexeccode it and take it and run it straight from the command line, it works fine.p  pI have tried echoing execwhoami which tells me that the PHP user is wwwdata. Ive tried giving permissions to wwwdata and changing ownership to wwwdata on the folder where I store the images. Ive also tried changing permissions to 777 just to see what would happen, and the answer is nothing.p  pIs there something Im missing Im running out of ideas to try. Thank youp  pstrongEditstrong Another thing that Ive checked is the output from the exec command, and the return value. It outputs an empty array, and it returns 1 as the return value.p  pstrongEdit 2strong After seeing that that directory should be writeablereadable for the PHP user, is it possible that pygments doesnt have permission to write it as a specific user Im not sure this makes sense, as when I run it myself it works fine, and in fact, when PHP runs it with the HTML lexer, it is able to run. Im not very experienced in Python, so I dont know if this is a potential issue.p

It is quite a simple way to achieve this.p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions15494963listboxdoesnotdisplaythebindingdataListBox does not display the binding dataap
Negative 162 pI have a JSON response being posted to my activemq topic.I have set up my route to unmarshal this response to a POJO. I then want to step through 3 different methods in succession which make use of the fields in the POJO that have been populated by the JSON object.p  pThat is basically what I am trying to do. My problem lies in the fact that I am still new to Camel and I am not sure whathow I should be passing the information from the route into my methods so that I can make use of the POJO that has been populated by the JSON values.p  pIf that makes any sense at all. I am going to post my Camel Route, and Java class below, I will hold off on the pojo because it is simple enough, just 10 fields varying between int and string with some gettersetter methods. p  pstrongEnrollResponsestrong is the name of the POJO.p  pAny help or guidancetips for this would be greatly appreciatedp  pstrongEDITUPDATEstrongp  pIn the console in eclipse I am getting the Sys outs from my setup method, so I know that it at least is getting to that step.

Say I have a library application with a Book model, and I have the following scopes defined codecheckedout, fiction, nonfiction, overdue, and checkedoutbycode.  p  pThe codelast scopecode, codecheckedoutbycode, is a lambda that takes a libraryuserid as an argument.  The application allows the librarian to run different kinds of queries that combine these scopes dynamically, based on user input.  So if the librarian wants to create a report showing all nonfiction books that are checked out, its easy to do something like this  p  precodecriteria  [nonfiction, checkedout]  lt array built based on what the user selected   books  Book.scoped   criteria.each criteria books  books.sendcriteria   codepre  pBut how do I do this with the scope that is set up as a lambda For instance, if the user wants to create a query showing books that are overdue and checkedoutby a particular person  In this case, Id want the criteria array to contain the overdue and checkedoutby scopes, but I cant figure out how to set that up with the lambda scope.  I tried  p  precodecriteria  [nonfiction, checkedoutby gt 6]   codepre  pbut that gives me an error saying codecheckedoutby gt 6 is not a symbolcode.  I also triedp  precodecriteria  [nonfiction, [checkedoutby, 6]] codepre  pand a few other variants, but none of them worked.  Does anyone know how to do thisp

Negative 162 pIve started playing around with the EnumerableLazy functionality in Ruby 2.0 and it looks really useful.p  pI have an Enumerable collection that pages through a remote data source. Because of this, I would like it to be a lazy collection. However, I dont want to have to instruct every user of my class to call .lazy every time they want to use any of the Enumerable methods on it. Instead it would be nice to include a hypothetical LazyEnumerable module and have all the enumerable methods be lazy by default.p  pDoes anyone have any ideas on a clean way to accomplish this Thanksp

The MiG Layout Cheatsheet says that I can append codepushcode to a bound size with a gap to make that gap greedy and take any left over space e.g. codegap relpushcode, but that doesnt seem to work in the following code that Ive triedp  precodeJFrame frame  new JFrameTest JPanel panel  new JPanelnew MigLayout JLabel label1  new JLabelTesting label1.setBorderBorderFactory.createLineBorderColor.black Border to clearly show JLabel boundaries panel.addlabel1,  JLabel label2  new JLabelTesting Once Again label2.setBorderBorderFactory.createLineBorderColor.black Border to clearly show JLabel boundaries panel.addlabel2, gap relpush frame.setContentPanepanel frame.pack frame.setMinimumSizenew Dimension400, 100 frame.setPreferredSizenew Dimension400, 100 frame.setVisibletrue codepre  pWhich displays a window like this img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comFIMnA.png altenter image description herep  pI would expect for the codegap relpushcode parameter to work like horizontal glue in the picture above and thus push the JLabel on the right all the way to the right edge of the window, but it doesnt.p  pHow can I get the same effect as BoxLayouts glue using MigLayout Am I misusing the codegapcode parameter or is there some other way to accomplish itp  pAlso, I realize that I could use docking in the example given, but Id like an answer without that because it wont work in a more complex layout Im creating.p

Negative 162 pLooking at various installations of SQL Server, sometimes the 4th column returned by a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms187372.aspx relnofollowcodexpmsvercodea will sometimes be a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms186939.aspx relnofollowcodenvarcharcodea and sometimes it will be a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms176089.aspx relnofollowcodevarcharcodea.  This appears to have no bearing on the version of SQL Server, since I see some copies of SQL Server 2000 up to 2012 return varchar, while others return nvarchar.  This also does not seem to have a bearing on Windows version or bitness.p  pWhy does this happen  and is there a way to either configure the output or know what data type will be used beforehandp  pemstrongEditemstrong I am using Visual FoxPro to query this information, which has a number of issues dealing with unicode. So, I need to know how to handle the data and convert it to ANSIsingle byte encoding  if it isnt already. I understand the limitations of ANSIsingle byte, but the loss of data is considered acceptable here.p  precodesqlexecconnhandle, exec xpmsver codepre  pIf ADO were in the picture, I would just use the data type properties inherit in a hrefhttpwww.w3schools.comadopropfieldtype.asp relnofollowRecordSetsa, but i am limited to FoxPro and its own cursor functionality. When pulled into FoxPro, the codeCharacterValuecode column  the 4th column in question here  is considered a a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryaa97537328vvs.7129.aspx relnofollowMEMOa data type, which is a fancy way of saying a string of some kind or even binary data possibly longer than 255 characters. It is really a catchall for long strings and any data types that FoxPro cannot handle, which is extremely unhelpful in this case.p  pThere is a a hrefhttpsupport.microsoft.comkb191867 relnofollowMicrosoft KB articlea that explicitly uses codexpmsvercode from FoxPro and states that SQL Server 7.0 and greater always returns Unicode for the stored procedure, but this is not always the case.  Also, since codexpmsvercode it is a stored procedure codesphelpcode and codespcolumnscode arent of any use here.p  pIn all honesty, I would prefer using a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms174396.aspx relnofollowcodeSERVERPROPERTYcodea, but it is not supported in SQL Server 7.0, which is a requirement. I would prefer not to overcomplicate the code by having different queries for different versions of SQL Server. Also, using a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms177512.aspx relnofollowcodeversioncodea is not a good option, since it would require parsing the text, would be prone to bugs, and doesnt provide all the information I need.p

Negative 162 pIm drawing a fairly simple 2D scene containing only rectangles. I have one FloatBuffer into which I put X, Y, Z, R, G, B, A, U, and V data for each vertex. I draw using codeglDrawArrayscode and codeGLTRIANGLESTRIPcode, keeping the rectangles separate with degenerate vertices.p  pTo facilitate the use of multiple textures, I keep separate float arrays for each textures draw calls. The texture is binded, the float array is put into the FloatBuffer, and I draw. Then the next texture is then binded and this continues until I have drawn all of my textures for this render.p  pI use an Orthographic projection so I can use the Z coordinates and codeGLDEPTHTESTcode for setting depth independently of the draw order.p  pTo use alpha blending, every piece of advice on the internet seems to sayp  precodeGLES20.glEnableGLES20.GLBLEND GLES20.glBlendFuncGLES20.GLSRCALPHA, GLES20.GLONEMINUSSRCALPHA codepre  pThis works fine per each textures draw, because I have the draw calls sorted in the buffer from back to front before drawing. I have no way to correctly draw texture2 under a partially transparent texture1 because of the depth test and texture1 being drawn before texture2. texture1 chops off the overlapping part of texture2 because the depth test says that texture1 is in front of texture2.p  pThe only ways I see around this are 1 only using 1 texture in the whole program, and 2 not using transparent textures. Neither of these are acceptable options.p  pBasically, I need a way to have alpha blending without needing to sort backtofront. Is this possiblep

Negative 162 pI am not quite sure how to ask this so I will start off with an example.

For example at time  1135, it would have to go back and find the last known time in the table 1130 and then return that pnumber.  So for t  1130, it would return pnumber  52.  But as soon as the t  1045 it would return pnumber  13.

Negative 162 pSO.p  pPerhaps the title is too general for the specific problem Im having.p  pI have a Perl script which connects to a SQLite database. During runtime I perform a lot of database operations such as SELECTs, INSERTs, UPDATEs, etc. I wrapped each database operation in its own subroutine mainly to hide the SQL statement and any additional processing of the result set.p  pI want to use the same database handler object every time I need to invoke one of this database operation subroutine, so what I have been doing is to pass the database handler object as an argument. For instancep  precodemy dbh  DBIgtconnect dbiSQLitedbnamedb.db, ,  or die  sub selectfromsystems      my dbh  shift     return dbhgtselectcolarrayrefSELECT hostname FROM systems  codepre  pJust as a side note, Im using Perl DBI.p  pIm just wondering if theres a more clever way to do this so I dont have to pass the database handler object as an argument.p  pI would like to avoid global variables, I dont feel they are the plague and in this case it may be justified, but still.p  pAny help or insight is greatly appreciated.p  pRegards.p
Negative 162 pI am new to AngularJS, and building an app that will interact with a server. The server has a REST API, but responds to some methods with plain text, and to others with JSON. I have implemented a simple http request method using AngularJS coderesourcecode service. p  pHowever, when the server response is plain text, the response in AngularJS is an object with one entry for each character in the response word.

I try to create a interactive introduction tutorial for my site using library Trip.js The problem appears by highlighting of particular elements. p  pThe approach to highlighting is following  First for fading the whole site content an overlay is created. It gets some opacity and zindex  3, to cover all the elements of the site. Than the element, which should be highlighted gets dynamically zindex  4, so it should be shown in front of the overlay.p  pThe problem is that this element could be contained in another element which has position  relative and zindex  2. So even if I set position  absolute to highlighted element, it is still shown behind the overlay, because zindex of parent element if lower than zindex of overlay. p  pI have access to style of the highlighted element and the overlay, but unfortunately access to parent element in generic way is nearly impossible since it is generated by other library, could be nested multiple times to other elements with their own style etc. p  pSo is there any way to force the highlighted element to be shown in front of the overlay regardless of parent elements stylep

Negative 162 pI am trying to to go to a new view controller before the current view controller appears but cant seem to get it. Basically my app, starts on a splash page and checks if you have a saved NSUserDefaults and if yes it opens the main view controller. However I dont want a user to see that view before seeing the main view when they are already a user, its not user friendly. I want the a current user to see the launch image and then the main view directly. However I cant really get that done. This is what I have done which produces the undesired effect.p  precode voidviewDidAppearBOOLanimated  [super viewDidAppearanimated] NSUserDefaults prefs  [NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] NSString user  [prefs stringForKeyuserName]  ifuser.lengthgt0     NSLogGoing straight to main s, Yes     [self performSegueWithIdentifierstartMain senderself]      codepre  pHow an I get around thisp
Negative 162 pIm having issues with Android 4.3 EDIT IN ALL APIS in a RelativeLayout with a TableLayout header, a LinearLayout scrollable body and a LinearLayout footer. The body contains two webviews and the activity works perfectly with API level lt18. When I run my application in API level 18 either simulated by AVD or installed in my Galaxy Nexus, when the webViews load the content, the text of textViews in the TableLayout disappear, and only remain the first Character or the first two charachters if the text is in two lines. It seems the webView change the orientation of the text..p  pI tried to insert codeandroidorientationhorizontalcode in the TableLayout and in the TableRow, but without results. Only if i remove my webViews, the text will be showp  pIs it an Android 4.3 bug, or i have to insert something in my code  I attached my xml file and a link to the screenshot.p  p a

Negative 162 pI need to implement some 3rdparty field validation in our sites forms. Currently, the validation of our form fields is done by using ASP.NET validators required, regex and Id like to continue use of these on the fields where we wont be using the new validation. The company providing us with the new validation services gave us all of the code to integrate into our site to get the new validation functioning, and the basic implementation just requires us to call a javascript method that reads the values of specified fields and validates them via a few service calls. Also, the implementation requires that the form initially has the codeonsubmitreturn falsecode attribute set.p  pThe issue that Im running into is when the validation script is attempting to submit the form, after a postvalidation function removes the forms onsubmit attribute since event validation is turned on not an option to turn off, the page throws the exception Invalid postback or callback argument. Perhaps Ive provided an excess of details to give context, but maybe the question boils down to Can you submit an ASP.NET form using javascript if event validation is enabled without causing this error And if so, howp

Negative 162 pIm working on a video game for my project and im running into a animation problem. Basically im doing a Final Fantasy style game where your recharging your ATB bar and once its full, you can do a skill. So I have 3 functions here. The first one is clearing my ATB bar so that it resets. This code works. The second one is refilling the timebar by moving a DIV block into place. This works as well. The third function is my attack skill function, which also works except for the fact that it does not do both of these animation functions in the order I placed them.p  pIf you look below, youll notice I have the code to first run the clear ATB function, and then run the time bar function, hoping that every time I click the button it would reset my ATB. The problem is, it completely ignores the FIRST function and runs the second one. I tried switching them and same thing occurs. So basically Im stuck where my code will always ignore the first one and operate the 2nd one if both of my animation functions are in the code. So now Im confused on how to fix this because I want BOTH codes to work. They work separately and independently as it stands now, but when I combine them, only the 2nd one registers.  p  precode    5.

Negative 162 pI am designing a website and in the navigation I have 2 links that have dropdown menus About and Services. When you hover your mouse over the links, the dropdown appears, then when you click on the link, the dropdown menu disappears, then if you click it again the dropdown reappears. So basically, in order to go to that page you have to triple click the link. Does anyone know what I can do to change this so it brings you to the page after just one clickp  pThis is what the navigation looks like in my HTML codep  precodeltnav idnavgt     ltulgt         ltligtlta hrefindex.htmlgtHomeltagtltligt         ltligt             ltspangtlta hrefabout.htmlgtAbout ltagtltspangt             ltulgt                 ltligtlta hrefbackground.htmlgtBackgroundltagtltligt                 ltligtlta hrefwhy.htmlgtWhy Choose Usltagtltligt                 ltligtlta hrefmanagement.htmlgtManagementltagtltligt                 ltligtlta hrefuniversity.htmlgtFinancial Universityltagtltligt                 ltligtlta hrefmedia.htmlgtMedia ltagt                     ltulgt                         ltligtlta hreftelevision.htmlgtTelevision Appearancesltagtltligt                         ltligtlta hrefarticles.htmlgtArticlesltagtltligt                         ltligtlta hrefbooks.htmlgtBooksltagtltligt                         ltligtlta hreffinancialsafari.htmlgtFinancial Safariltagtltligt                         ltligtlta hrefphotos.htmlgtPhotosltagtltligt                         ltligtlta hrefvideos.htmlgtVideosltagtltligt                     ltulgt                 ltligt             ltulgt         ltligt         ltligt             ltspangtlta hrefservices.htmlgtServices ltagtltspangt             ltulgt                 ltligtlta hrefretire.htmlgtRetirement Planningltagtltligt                 ltligtlta hrefannuities.htmlgtAnnuitiesltagtltligt                 ltligtlta hrefestate.htmlgtEstate Planningltagtltligt                 ltligtlta hrefinsurance.htmlgtInsuranceltagtltligt                 ltligtlta hrefbusiness.htmlgtBusiness Consultingltagtltligt                 ltligtlta hreftaxes.htmlgtTax Planningltagtltligt                 ltligtlta hrefinvest.htmlgtInvestment Managementltagtltligt             ltulgt         ltligt         ltligtlta hrefbloggtBlogltagtltligt         ltligtlta hrefcontact.htmlgtContactltagtltligt     ltulgt ltnavgt codepre  pHere is the relevant CSSp  precodenav  position absolute right 2em lineheight 5.5em   nav gt ul gt li  float left padding 0 0.8em 0 0.8em   nav gt ul gt li gt a,  nav gt ul gt li gt span  color fff textdecoration none texttransform uppercase fontweight 800 fontsize 0.95em letterspacing 0.075em padding 0.5em 0.8em 0.5em 0.8em borderradius 6px outline 0   nav a  color FFF textdecoration none   nav avisited  color FFF textdecoration none   nav gt ul gt li.active gt a, nav gt ul gt li.currentpageitem gt a, nav gt ul gt li.active gt span, nav gt ul gt li.currentpageitem gt span  background rgba0,0,0,0.15 boxshadow inset 1px 1px 0px 0px rgba0,0,0,0.025, 1px 1px 0px 0px rgba255,255,255,0.025   nav gt ul gt lilastchild  paddingright 0   nav gt ul gt li gt ul  display none margintop 2px  codepre  hr  pEDIT I found out the dropdown menu is controlled by a piece of jQuery called dropotron.

Negative 162 pAs it says in the title I am getting the error  Ignored because document is finalised when running a cshtml page in explorer 9 mode with explorer 9 standards from the developer console.  p  pI first noticed the issue using someones laptop that runs explorer 9 however, the page renders absolutely fine in explorer 10.p  pThis week I have spent a day and a half on this issue searching Stackoverflow etc so, its time to ask for help someone out there may be able to point out what Im doing wrong.p  pI have tried moving the IE10 Compatibility meta tag to be first after the head tag in the cshtml page and then in the SiteLayout page.  Ive tried using the tag in just the cshtml page, then just in the SiteLayout page, then in both the cshtml and layout pages.p  pAny errors in the console have been worked through.  I have tried changing the JS, moving this and that, all with no joy.p  pI have become aware that I do not need meta, head and body tags etc. in the cshtml page as well as in the SiteLayout page.  This has never been an issue before though and the page works fine in IE10. p  pSurely, if I can get an explorer 9 browser to run in explorer 10 mode using explorer 10 standards the page should render fine as it works in IE10. So, it must be the IE10 meta tag  rightp  pHere are the two pages with irrelevant content stripped out  Thanks.p  ppage.cshtmlp  precodeltDOCTYPE htmlgt lthtml langengt  ltheadgt  ltmeta httpequivXUACompatible contentIE10gt  ltmeta charsetutf8 gt  lttitlegtPage.Titlelttitlegt      lt Le styles gt     ltlink hrefassetscssbootstrap.css relstylesheetgt     ltlink hrefassetscssbootstrapresponsive.css relstylesheetgt  ltstylegt  .pageborder width800px       margin0 auto 0 auto   header  marginbottom 20px    ltstylegt   lt Google Script gt  ltscript typetextjavascript srchttpsapis.google.comjsplusone.jsgtltscriptgt  ltscriptgt .noConflict jQuery document .readyfunction    document.readyfunction      farclouds.panfps 30, speed 0.7, dir left     nearclouds.panfps 30, speed 1, dir left       function           contact.popover      ltscriptgt  ltheadgt  ltbodygt  ltdiv classpagebordergt ltbrgt   ltdiv idtopgtltdivgt  lt Header section not head in body as per asp.net template with social icons gt  ltheader idbannergt ltdiv classlogo stylepaddingtop 20pxgt  lth3 stylecolor 0088ccgtlta href idpopoverData datacontentHosting Now ampnbspampnbspampnbspAvailable relpopover dataplacementbottom datatriggerhovergtltimg srcimagestestTextLogoBlue.png altbigInt Logo width150 height100gtltagtltbrgt   ltspan  classmutedgtwww.bigInt.bizltspangt  lth3gtlt Line break added to www.bigint.biz under logo gt ltdivgt lt facebook like script gt ltdiv idfbrootgtltdivgt ltscriptgtfunctiond, s, id    var js, fjs  d.getElementsByTagNames[0]   if d.getElementByIdid return   js  d.createElements js.id  id   js.src  connect.facebook.netenGBall.jsxfbml1   fjs.parentNode.insertBeforejs, fjs document, script, facebookjssdkltscriptgt   lt Script for Twitter like button gt ltscriptgtfunctiond,s,idvar js,fjsd.getElementsByTagNames[0],phttp.testd.locationhttphttpsifd.getElementByIdidjsd.createElementsjs.ididjs.srcpplatform.twitter.comwidgets.jsfjs.parentNode.insertBeforejs,fjsdocument, script, twitterwjsltscriptgt       lt Script for Linkedin Share button gt  ltscript srchttpplatform.linkedin.comin.js typetextjavascriptgt  lang enUS ltscriptgt   ltheadergt  ltdiv idmaingtltdivgt  ltdiv idcontentgtltdivgt   RenderBody  ltdivgt      ltbodygt lthtmlgt  ltscriptgt   popoverData.popover popoverData.popover placement right  popoverOption.popover trigger hover  ltscriptgt    codepre  hr  pSiteLayout.cshtmlp  precode Layout  SiteLayout.cshtml codepre  pp  p     p  precodeltheadgt  ltmeta httpequivXUACompatible contentIE10gt  ltmeta charsetutf8 gt  lttitlegtPage.Titlelttitlegt      lt Le styles gt     ltlink hrefassetscssbootstrap.css relstylesheetgt     ltlink hrefassetscssbootstrapresponsive.css relstylesheetgt  ltstylegt  .pageborder width800px       margin0 auto 0 auto   header  marginbottom 20px    ltstylegt   lt Google Script gt  ltscript typetextjavascript srchttpsapis.google.comjsplusone.jsgtltscriptgt  ltscriptgt .noConflict jQuery document .readyfunction    document.readyfunction      farclouds.panfps 30, speed 0.7, dir left     nearclouds.panfps 30, speed 1, dir left       function           contact.popover      ltscriptgt  ltheadgt  ltbodygt  ltdiv classpagebordergt ltbrgt   ltdiv idtopgtltdivgt  lt Header section not head in body as per asp.net template with social icons gt  ltheader idbannergt ltdiv classlogo stylepaddingtop 20pxgt  lth3 stylecolor 0088ccgtlta href idpopoverData datacontentHosting Now ampnbspampnbspampnbspAvailable relpopover dataplacementbottom datatriggerhovergtltimg srcimagestestTextLogoBlue.png altbigInt Logo width150 height100gtltagtltbrgt   ltspan  classmutedgtwww.bigInt.bizltspangt  lth3gtlt Line break added to www.bigint.biz under logo gt ltdivgt lt facebook like script gt ltdiv idfbrootgtltdivgt ltscriptgtfunctiond, s, id    var js, fjs  d.getElementsByTagNames[0]   if d.getElementByIdid return   js  d.createElements js.id  id   js.src  connect.facebook.netenGBall.jsxfbml1   fjs.parentNode.insertBeforejs, fjs document, script, facebookjssdkltscriptgt   lt Script for Twitter like button gt ltscriptgtfunctiond,s,idvar js,fjsd.getElementsByTagNames[0],phttp.testd.locationhttphttpsifd.getElementByIdidjsd.createElementsjs.ididjs.srcpplatform.twitter.comwidgets.jsfjs.parentNode.insertBeforejs,fjsdocument, script, twitterwjsltscriptgt       lt Script for Linkedin Share button gt  ltscript srchttpplatform.linkedin.comin.js typetextjavascriptgt  lang enUS ltscriptgt   ltheadergt  ltdiv idmaingtltdivgt  ltdiv idcontentgtltdivgt   RenderBody  ltdivgt lt end page border gt      lt Static footer example in addition to footer in site layout page gt  ltfooter idfooter classfootergt          lta hreftop classtotopgtBack to the topltagt   ltfootergt  ltbodygt lthtmlgt  ltscriptgt   popoverData.popover popoverData.popover placement right  popoverOption.popover trigger hover  ltscriptgt codepre

Negative 162 pIve got a boatload of legacy project files that use a ProjectRoot variable in include paths to refer to the root of the source tree. We define the variable in our visual studio environment so desktop builds can find their way to the tfs workspace in use.p  pI would like to define this variable in the Team Build environment via an MSBuild command line option in my tfs build definition, but I cant seem to find a way that works. I found an answer a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9287312listofmsbuildpropertiestfspassestoabuildscriptList of msbuild properties TFS passes to a build scripta with a list of variables and SolutionRoot looked promising.p  pWhen I put codepProjectRootSolutionRootcode in the codeMSBuild Argumentscode for my build definition, ProjectRoot ends up empty. I want it to expand to something like  codeDBuilds18TfsProjectBuildDefsrccodep  pIs there a way to define my variable with the value of the root of the workspace sources in Team Buildp  pNote I tried to figure this out in TFS2010 and finally gave up and modified the BuildProcessTemplate to define the variable using the SourcesDirectory variable thats available inside that context. I thought Id take another run at it in the hopes of using the new template in TFS2013 without modification, but Im still stumped.p  pstrongUPDATEstrong Turns out the syntax I had in my MSBuild Arguments would work if the variable Im dereferencing were actually being passed to msbuild. The list from the other post I reference seems to no longer be valid. Looking at the detailed Team Build logs, it looks like the only variables being passed in to msbuild in Team Build are OutDir, BuildId, BuildLabel, BuildTimestamp, BuildSourceVersion, and BuildDefinition. None of those gives me the info my current msbuild scripts need at build time so Im stuck with either reworking all our project files or continuing with the BuildProcessTemplate modifications Ive been using. Unless someone comes along with a better answer here.p

Negative 162 pIve got some kind of layers in my application. These layers are following a structure like a company has settlements, settlements have sections, sections have machines, machines are producing items, to produce items the machine needs tools,... At the very end of this hierarchy there are entries how many items could be produced with a specific part of a toolcalled cuttingtool. Based on that, a statistic can be calculated. On each layer the statistic results of the next upper layer are getting added.  Take a look at this diagram img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comwXEu0.jpg altenter image description herep  pOn each layer, a statistic is displayed. For example The user navigates to the second layerItems. There are 10 items. The user can see a pie chart which displays the costs of each item. These costs are calculated by adding all costs of the items toolsthe next upper layer. The costs of the tools are calculated by adding all costs of the parts of the tools... I know that is a bit complicated so if there any questions, just ask me for a more detailed explaination.p  pNow my problem To calculate the cost of an itemthe same statistic is provided for machines, tools,...  for each layer on the diagram, I need to get all Lifetimes of the Item. So I am using a recursive call to skip all layers between the Item and the Lifetime.  That workes quite well BUT I am using far to many SelectManylinq commands. As a result, the performance is extremely bad.  Ive thought about a joins or proceduresstored in the database to speed that up, but I am by far not experied which techniques like databases. So I want to ask you, what you would do Currently I am using something like thatp  precodepublic IEnumerableltIHierachyEntitygt GetLifetimesIEnumerableltIHierachyEntitygt entities      ifentities is IEnumerableltLifetimegt              return entities          else              return GetLifetimesentities.SelectManyx gt x.Childs       codepre

Inside codedjsitecode I have codedjsitecode folder and four files codeinit.py, settings.py, urls.py and wsgi.pycode.

Lets say we have a codePersoncode entityp  precodepublic class Person      private String firstName     private String lastName     private int age     private Color favoriteColor  codepre  pAnd that codePersoncode instances get persisted to a codepeoplecode MySQL tablep  precodeCREATE TABLE people      personid PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,     firstname VARCHAR100 NOT NULL,     lastname VARCHAR100 NOT NULL,          I realize these column defs are not valid but this is just pseudocode     age INT NOT NULL,     colorid FOREIGN KEY colors NOT NULL   Say we also have a colors table and people has a 11 relationship with it  codepre  pNow lets say there are 2 software systems, or 1 system with 2 threads on it, that are trying to update the same codePersoncode entity at the same timep  ul liSoftwareThread 1 is trying to persist a surname change from emJohn Smithem to emJohn Doeemli liSoftwareThread 2 is trying to persist a change in the favorite color from emREDem to emGREENemli ul  h3My questionsh3  ol liHow could optimistic locking be implemented on the codepeoplecode andor codecolorscode tables Looking for specific DDL exampleli liHow could you then utilize this optimistic locking at the applicationJava layer Looking for specific code exampleli liCan someone run me through a scenario where the DDLcode changes from 1 and 2 above would come into play in my scenario or any other scenario and would optimistically lock the codepeoplecodecodecolorscode tables correctly Basically, Im looking to see optimistic locking in action, with an easytofollow explanation of why it works.li ol

I am defining two methodp  precodepublic static void displayPermutationString s public static void displayPermutationString s1, String s2 codepre  pThe first method simply invokes codedisplayPermutation , scode. The second method uses a loop to move a character from s2 to s1 and recursively invokes it with a new s1 and s2. The base case is that s2 is empty and prints s1 to the console.p  pCan anyone help me to find what is the problem of the following code p  pHers examplep  precode public static void displayPermutationString s              displayPermuatation, s               private static void displayPermuatationString s1, String s2          base case when s2 is empty, print s1         if s2.isEmpty              System.out.printlns1                  else                    for int i  0 i lt s2.length i                          move a char from s1 to s2, and recursively invokes it with                          new s1 and s2             s1  s1  s2.charAti             s2  s2.substring0, i  s2.substringi1             displayPermuatations1, s2                   codepre  pif s  abc, it prints only abc acbp  pit seems that in the first call of displayPermuatation, abc, it does not finish the for loop.... any commentsp  pThanks for all the comments below. I think the mistakes I made is because that passing object as argument to a method is actually passing the reference. it is not like primitive data passing by value. When changing the object, it will affect following method call using that object. p

Negative 162 pIm the author of a PHP web application that provides a dashboard and control panel for its users environments. p  pFor context, the architecture is roughly as followsp  ul liapache webserver w PHP 5.4 handling user interface requestsli liMYSQL 5.5 percona storing data about user environmentsli liSOAP service hosted by a separate system that allows Northbound Interface NBI requests to affect user environmentsli lia separate parsing system that interprets changes to users environments and updates the database according to changes detected.li ul  pWhen a user logs into the web application, their environment is loaded up from the database and displayed. The user interface is kept up2date with AJAX polling requests to the PHP server. I have rigged up these requests to not stack by keeping the connection state stored in a JS boolean so that whenever the poll interval is triggered, subsequent requests do not stack up. i.e. The subsequent requests are skipped until the active request completes.p  pIn addition to polling to keep the interface up to date, the SOAP service can be utilized via AJAX request to the PHP server, triggering a synchronous SOAPClient request to the NBI from the server, to perform operations that affect the users environments. When a change is made over these requests, the parsing system eventually picks up the change, and updates the database, causing the polling mechanism to update the interface, completing the operation from the point of view of the user.p  pThe userinitiated AJAX requests that perform NBI calls can last a substantial amount of time, sometimes even more than a minute before the SOAP request is released, and the status of the SOAPrequested operation is returned to the AJAX request that triggered it.p  pIn the users GUI, Im locking down other AJAX requests including the polls, while one of these operations is ongoing, ensuring only a single AJAX request is active at a time. p  pstrongHeres the problemstrong If this request is CANCELLED by xhr.abort, the server side request to the NBI call remains open until completion. While the completion is pending, if the user attempts to navigate elsewhere or perform another operation or poll, the request is held up until the server completes the original cancelled request. p  pTo be clear The hold up seems to be SERVERSIDE, as there is no ongoing concurrent AJAX or otherwise request limit being hit in the browser. p  pUntil the server finishes its SOAP client request triggered by the aborted AJAX request, further requests from the same browser are held up, it seems, at the server.p  pI understand that killing the AJAX request mid stream does not kill the request at the server, but why is the server holding up further requests until after the AJAX request that triggered the NBI call is abortedp

Negative 162 pI am designing a REST API for text analysis, and I want to accept submitted content as either JSON or in file format which is more convenient for large submissions. The JSON format has a text field, from which the text is extracted. Uploaded files just contain raw textual content. So I will be handling these two types of content as either a JSONencoded body, or in the latter case as a multipartformdata upload. My question is really related to how I should design my API with respect to handling these two different types of submissions, whilst remaining as RESTful as possible.p  pMy initial thought was to have two different endpoints, codejsoncode for JSON, and codefilescode for uploaded files. It doesnt seem right, however, to have two endpoints differentiated only by the type of content submitted by clients, rather than functionality. As an alternative I then considered differentiating according to request method, using PUT for JSON and POST for files. Again this seems wrong, since it is add odds with the semantics of the request methods themselves.p  pIt seems the only alternative is to accept the two types of encodings via the same endpoint. Im still not sure if this is the right way to proceed from a design perspective, however, hence my question. I guess this is precisely what the codeContentTypecode header is for, as stated a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions17681774restinputforpostcansameresourcedifferentiatebetweenjsonandxmlinputherea. But there seems a more radical distinction between JSON and multipartformdata than between JSON and XML.p
Negative 162 pI have a backup script utilizing rsync to synchronize a source and destination folder. Well that is pretty straight forward and doesnt need a 180 line bash script. The problem is that I want all modifieddeleted files and directories in the source to be copied from the destination to a safe location before rsync synchronizes the directories.p  pI use the rsync delete argument because, well I want the folders synchronized, just that I also want a backup of the deleted and modified files and folders. rsync lists all deleted files and folders even if the files are included in the deleted folder. The output of rsync looks like thisp  precodesending incremental file list .d..t......OriginalArtist deleting  OriginalArtistnymappskitfil.mp3 deleting  OriginalArtistnymapp sent 416.81K bytes  received 732 bytes  25.30K bytessec total size is 89.97G  speedup is 215480.91 DRY RUN codepre  pHere both the deleted file and the deleted folder are listed. If you would simply copy everything to the right of the symbol, that starts with deleting you would end up with copying files in deleted folders when you have already copied the folder and its content. Or the other way around depending on which entry is listed first in the rsync output. In case of copying a file to a folder that doesnt exist, cp will just exit with error code that the destination folder doesnt exist. So the best thing is to copy all deleted folders first and then check if the deleted files are already included in the deleted folders. p  pBasically I want a list of all the parent folders of the following example list of files and foldersp  precodedeleting  OriginalArtistHDLCfake.mp3 deleting  OriginalVariousblabla.mp3 deleting  OriginalArtistDirengreyduh.mp3 deleting  OriginalArtistDirengrey deleting  OriginalArtistDirengreydir1dir2dir1 deleting  Non Originalhey.mp3 deleting  Non OriginalElectronicbla.mp3 deleting  Non OriginalElectronicdir2 deleting  Non OriginalSynthmeh.mp3 deleting  differentparentnofile.mp3 codepre  pThe output should bep  precodeOriginalArtistHDLC OriginalVarious OriginalArtistDirengrey Non Original Non OriginalElectronic Non OriginalSynth differentparent codepre  pThe reason that it is not enough to just copy the deleted folders and skip the filespart is that also deleted and modified files that reside in folders that werent deleted should be copied to the safe location and you do not want to copy an entire folder just because one file in it was deleted.p  pAs you see this is more complex than meets the eye at a first glance. Is there a friendly soul out there that either can present me a set of commands that would find these parent directories or possibly another solution to the problem.p

Lets suppose, though, that I still want Bar and Bang to be derived from the abstract base class Foo, but that I want the name attribute of the child classes to have emdifferentem validations.p  pHow do I annotate Bar and Bang so that strongBar.namestrong has a max length of, say, 12 characters while strongBang.namestrong has a max length of 8 charactersp  pThanks much, Robp

Negative 162 pI have a MyISAM table call it A with about 5 million rows, and a related MyISAM table B which joins to A on the primary key containing about 200 million rows. Table A has about 12 fields, mostly varchar, while table B contains 2 integer fields. p  pI originally created these tables locally on my Windows 8 machine 4GB RAM  SSD Hard disk by running scripts which inserted the rows in chunks. I then mysqldumped the database to a .sql file.p  pI then transferred this .sql file to my LIVE environment Windows Server 2008, 4GB RAM and nonSSD Hard disk. I restored the database from the dump file to a new database.p  pIf I now perform an update of, say, 2000 rows in A and about 80 in B for each row inserted in A in the local machine, it takes a couple of minutes maybe 3 at most, whilst if I updated the same rows on the LIVE environment, it would take about 1.5 hours.p  pWhy is there this significant difference Both the local and LIVE machines have the same memory, and specs are very similar...Could it be down to the fact that my local machine has an SSD hard drive Or did I need to perform an OPTIMIZEANALYZE tables or anything else on the LIVE database after restoring it from the dump filep  pThanks in advance, Timp

Negative 162 pIm working with online marketplace site where users can sell their own stuff and visitors can browse marketplace by categories.p  pI have been reading about mysql pagination that if you use limit with offset, it will use alot resources and takes long time to execute if its huge database.p  pSo, I dont want to use LIMIT 10000, 20 as example, only if its last choise.p  pIf there was no categories, this would do fine SELECT  FROM products WHERE id  10000 LIMIT 20p  pBut, as there is categories for products involved, I cant use that. Lets say that first product added to category id 10 is added after there is 2000 products in whole database. That product would get ID 2001.p  pSo if I would browse first page of category id 10, this query would run SELECT  FROM products WHERE catid  10 LIMIT 20p  pIf I go to next page, this runs SELECT  FROM products WHERE catid  10 AND id  20 LIMIT 20p  pSo, basicly visitor would see product 2001 in every page until he hits page 101 when query looks for products that id is over 2020 and thats why I cant use WHERE id  something in query.p  pLong story short, whats best way to deal with pagination when working with categories and doesnt eat so much performancep

Negative 162 pI am using a custom BeaconManager delegate so that beacon ranging is not determined by the lifecycle of the view controller. Everything works great but every once in a while 12 days beacon ranging will stop working and didRangeBeacons will never get called. The only way to fix this is for me to reset my iPhone, once I do this, it works perfectly. Below is the code that I am using. The basic flow is that when my ViewController calls ViewDidLoad it sends a notification back to the AppDelegate to tell it to start ranging for beacons, I never tell it to stop then because I want it to continue to range for beacons no matter where the user navigates to in the app. Im wondering if my code is causing this or if this is just a bug with Bluetooth.

However, I would like to sort it on one additional field Thing.lasttouched. If I add this to the sort, it wont work because Thing.lasttouched is not the property to which the inequality filter is applied. I cant add an additional inequality filter, since were only allowed one, plus its not needed actually, thats why Thing.leve.IN is there.. not needed as a filter, but required for the sort.p  pSo, what Im wondering is, could I run the query with the filters that I want, and then run code to sort the query results myself I know I could pull all the parameters I want to sort and store them in dictionaries and sort them that way, but it seems to me there ought to be a way to handle this with the query.p  pIve searched for days for this but have had no luck.p  pJust in case you need it, heres the class definition of Thingp  precodeclass Thingndb.Model     title  ndb.StringProperty     level  ndb.IntegerProperty     fork  ndb.BooleanProperty     recursionlevel  ndb.IntegerProperty     forkof  ndb.KeyProperty     creationdate  ndb.DateTimePropertyautonowaddTrue     lasttouched  ndb.DateTimePropertyautonowTrue     status  ndb.BooleanProperty     description  ndb.StringProperty     ownerid  ndb.StringProperty     frequency  ndb.IntegerProperty     startdate  ndb.DateTimePropertyautonowaddTrue     duedate  ndb.DateTimeProperty codepre

Negative 162 pIve been working on a project, a socket server, using NodeJS, with some great help from people on this site, my project is nearing completion, but I have an error generated on my code every once in a while, and I cant seem to pin point the error down, since the error log does not give a name of a variable, function or anything related to the problem, it just throws off this messagep  precodeException TypeError Cannot read property 0 of undefined codepre  pMy problem also arises from the fact that there is nothing much moving in my code unless someone is connected to it, I do have an interval that runs every 4 minutes and send an update query to my DB so the connection to the DB will stay alive we dont want to change the mySQL server waittimeout since we use the same DB for other projects and products that needs it that way, and a kind of a global timer also set with setInterval that execute actions being sent to it from dynamicaly created game rooms, but again, the error pops up even if simply restart the service, and leave it untouched, it will come up every 1020 minutes or so... So far Ive been using this simple code to catch errorsp  precodeprocess.onuncaughtException, functionerr     logException   errltbrgt  codepre  pbut this does not give the information I need to know how to debug and find the problem. My question is is there another way to handle these errors in a way that will return a little more information about the nature of the problemp  pThanksp

Negative 162 pAfter using an std vector to hold my move list for my chess engine, I realised that because chess has an averaging factor of 35 i.e. something like 35 legal moves from a typical position, the vector was resizing a lot, thereby negatively impacting the performance of the move generator. One way around this which I only realised today is by reserving a minimum capacity for the vector. However, the possibility of using alloca attracted my attention. This is probably a very simple question, but the documentation on alloca is pretty scarce, with very very few examples of how to use it.p  pSo an answer from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11578160allocationofvariablesizedclassAllocation of variablesized classa mentions that stack allocations cannot be resized. Nevertheless, would the following be validp  precode    struct MoveList             MoveList capacity10                   moves  Move allocasizeofMove  10                void resize                   capacity  2           moves  Move allocasizeofMove  capacity                 void pushback        Move moves        int size        int capacity      codepre  pSpecifically, if say, a capacity of 10 is insufficient from alloca the first time around, is it syntactically valid and correct to simply call alloca again to allocate some more memory strongWill this method give better performance compared to std vector with reserve, or only increase the chance of a stack overflowstrong My Move struct requires some 28 bytes of memory, and I suspect that the engine will recursively search using alphabeta to maybe 7 or 8 ply maximum so that perhaps some 28  35  8  8kb max will be used from the stack. I read somewhere that typically stacks have a limit of 1Mb so this should not be too much rightp  pEdit Thanks to the answers below, I realise now that my initial understanding of what alloca did was wrong. However, I would still like to know if it is possible to use alloca in the manner belowp  precode    int main              int arr  int allocasizeofint         arr  allocasizeofint  2 is this resizing valid      codepre

Negative 162 pstrongEditstrong No work around yet, but Facebook in there own SDK seemed to have deprecated using the system FB signon.

Right now I have no validation method to check if the puzzle is solvable in any way, so long story short its by chance if its solvable.p  pWhat I needbr I need an algorithm or a method to validate if the puzzle is solvable cause as it is right now I only have a random chance of it being solvable due to the random number removal chance. This should not be done using brute forceBacktracking but instead it should look at the puzzle and take decisions on what numbers go where, basically just as you and I would solve it. This way I can verify not only if it has a single solve but also if you and I can solve it.p  pA small graphical view of variables and how the classes is connectedp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comteoB5.png altClass diagramp  pA visual representation of how the sudoku is structured using the above examplep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comZzuVG.png altSudoku representationp  pThe 1 to9 numbers in the sudoku is the cells 1 to 9.p  pIf you need any more detailed information on the program please tell me and I will add it to this form, I just tried to keep it as short and simple as possible while still trying to cover everything relevant for this issue.p

Negative 162 pHow can we capture only the email address in an api response for the gmail API. The  codefieldscode parameter is set to codepayloadheaderscode, which returns way more data than we need in the response.  All we need is the codevaluecode from one codenamevaluecode pair in the JSON response for examplep  pThe full response as we have it now looks something like thisp  precode          payload       headers [                                     name DeliveredTo,                   value xxxxxxx                                   name Received,                  value xxxxxxxx                 ,                                  name ReceivedSPF,                 value                   ,......                                     name To,                   value xxxxxxx                   , ...... E.T.C........E.T.C ......    All we want is one namevalue pair to be returned e.g.                 payload                   headers [                                    name XFailedRecipients,                value .............                              ]        codepre  pA better question might be is there a better way to capture bouncedreturned mail than this via the gmail APIp  pAlso, is it possible to request an XML response instead of JSON. How can that be done for the gmail APIp  pThanks p

The reason being is that codesuper.getMajorMinortrue, username, source.getConnectioncode performs a MAX on the database table and then increments this by one. I assume therefore it would be possible for 2 max statements to occur at the same time before a user has registered that pair and therefore we would get a dirty readwrite.p  pI could lock the table in order to preserve the integrity of the data however would another solution be to synchronise the register method. This would have the same effect as locking the table i believe but would the performance impact be worsep  pThanksp

Negative 162 pThe sp is used to add an additional unit to an existing customer. There are three tables used. Information is entered into the first table, then partially info from the first table is entered into a second table, and last table has all info from the first table once again. The problem is that every time I add a new unit the unit before UB ends up to be duplicated 8 times. If I add another unit another 8 rows are added to that unit UB. Moreover, when duplicates are created new ids are assigned which are the PKs.

Negative 162 pI am currently taking a class on Assembly Language and Computer Architecture. Were programming in MASM for x86 processors. I have a Macbook Air, so of course I have to run Windows on a virtual machine to program in MASM for our assignments.p  pWhat Im confused about Were learning about, and programming for x86 architecture. When I looked up my Macbook Airs processor, it seemed to be in the x86 family. Considering that, why doesnt MASM work with Mac OS X p  pFurthermore, if assembly language communicates directly w hardware, why does merely installing the Windows OS or running it through a VM on Apple Hardware suddenly allow me to program in MASM p  pThanks, Ianp  p[EDIT for clarification My understanding  please tell me if im wrong  is that Assembly Language is as low as you can go. I.e. its preoperating system, and provides instructions directly to the hardware itself. Thus, I dont understand why an assembly language for x86 architecture doesnt work on ALL x86 machines, regardless of OS]    p

The server is running PHP 5.4.3.p  pAny advicep

Negative 162 pIn C there are two ways one can declare an object. For examplep  precode The first way vectorltintgt nums  new vectorltintgt   The second way vectorltintgt nums codepre  pPeople say that the first declaration allocates the object in the heap and the second on the stack. I can imagine how it works if the vector object is in the heap. The compiler would just find a free block in the heap to store the vector.

Negative 162 pIs there a way to listen to home button press in iOS devices using PhoneGapCordovap  pIn iOS, its done like thisp  precode voidapplicationWillResignActiveUIApplication application       Sent when the application is about to move from active to inactive state. This can occur for certain types of temporary interruptions such as an incoming phone call or SMS message or when the user quits the application and it begins the transition to the background state.      Use this method to pause ongoing tasks, disable timers, and throttle down OpenGL ES frame rates. Games should use this method to pause the game.    voidapplicationDidEnterBackgroundUIApplication application       Use this method to release shared resources, save user data, invalidate timers, and store enough application state information to restore your application to its current state in case it is terminated later.       If your application supports background execution, this method is called instead of applicationWillTerminate when the user quits.    voidapplicationWillTerminateUIApplication application       Called when the application is about to terminate. Save data if appropriate. See also applicationDidEnterBackground.  codepre

Negative 162 pIs it a good idea to initialize a timer to do a periodic task in a WCF service host or will that mess with the lifecycle or performance of the service being hostedp  pI have a custom service host that announces its availability with the goal of creating a registry for clients upon starting and stopping. I want to create a timer to do this periodically but my concern is that this will cause problems I havent ran into any yet but maybe I havent stressed it enough or something or maybe it will eat resources and kill the performance of the service. The idea is to hookup the timer on the OnOpened and OnClosing events, of course.p  pFor what is worth, this service is hosted in IIS so it is IIS the one instantiating and managing the service host.p

Negative 162 pWell, somehow even after reading in a lot of textbooks really a lot and on the Internet for a long while I still cant completely comprehend what the difference between the two mentioned things is.p  pTo simplify the question, according to lets say Wikipedia a data type isp  blockquote   pa classification identifying one of various types of data, such as real, integer or Boolean, that determines the possible values for that type the operations that can be done on values of that type the meaning of the data and the way values of that type can be stored.p blockquote  pstrongwith it being mostly the implementation of some Abstract data typestrong like the real numbers or the whole numbers.p  pAll good, then comes the data structurep  blockquote   pis a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently.[1][2] Data structures can implement one or more particular abstract data types., which are the means of specifying the contract of operations and their complexity. In comparison, stronga data structure is a concrete implementation of the contract provided by an ADTstrong.p blockquote  pSo a data structure is an implementation of an ADT like say a stack or queue.p  pBut wouldnt that make it a data type as wellp  pAll that I can truly see is that a data type could range from really simple things without any structural organization to sophisticated structures of data what really counts is that they are an implementation of an ADT mirroring the important aspects of it and that they could be envisioned as a single entity like  a list or tree, but data structures must contain at least some sort of logical or mathematical organization to classify as a data structure, but sadly this difference would make many entities both a data structure and a data type simultaneously.p  pSo what is the solid difference between a simple plain data type and a data structurep  pI would gladly accept an answer with specifying a specific book about this topic which goes deep enough to explain all this matters, also if someone can recommend me some good books about data structures in C.p

Negative 162 pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comkvgD3.png altenter image description herep  pI need to use a tags input like control to handle multiple urls to be inputted by the user in one field, with the same user experience as that of standard tags input e.g the one on stakeoverflow when you tag your questions.p  pBootstrap Tags input seems to do the job well as far as ive tested BUT iam noticing that before you actually commit the url string to the input field, the string is truncated. After youve clicked return, the url is captured correctly as the first url on my screenshot above.p  pHow can i increase the limit of the string url BEFORE committing the url in edit mode so that the user can see the full link.p  pPlease try to paste a link as a tag on the bootstrap tags input first example a hrefhttptimschlechter.github.iobootstraptagsinputexamples relnofollowherea to test this behaviour.p  pIf this cannot be done using this plugin, can you please suggest a plugin that has the same functionality of a tag input but more suitable for urls of any size.p

Negative 162 pI have been looking for a while now for a way to trigger a Jenkins job from the status or a ticketstory in Jira changing status. To give a more detailed example when my team moves a ticket to the ready for test column we would like to be able to trigger a sanity test pack in Jenkins, the ideal situation would then be that we are able to post the results generated as a html as a comment on the ticket within Jira. Failing that we would like to be able to publish the results as simply passfail.p  pI have recently been looking at the Jenkins Jira plugin but this does not seem to have the functionality to work both ways, in other words it can post results after a job has run but you cannot trigger the job from a change of status in Jira. Is there any such plugin available or is it something that we will need to create ourselvesp  pCheers in advancep

Negative 162 pI have been given an app to develop based on ORDER MANAGEMENT, I am developing the most basic task of this app, which is List of items with ORDER Button, when button is clicked, a dialog appears with the item title which asks a user to enter quantity of item which is to be ordered.

It   also works, Dialog asks for Quantity using Edittext, on confirming dialog action I am also getting the value of edittext as a string and saving it in a variable. Now the problem I am facing is when I click on the second last and last item in the listview, it returns me the id of first and second item respectively, i.e. 1 and 2.

Also check if there is exact match 1 to 1 and use the NcicCode  where there is exact match. Otherwise, if there is no matching NcicCode  to the MncisCode then do not display anything do nothing.  p  pThe new XML file I am now using looks like thisp  precode    ltVehicleMakeMappinggt     ltMappinggt         ltNcicCodegtAUHEltNcicCodegt         ltMncisCodegtAUSTltMncisCodegt         ltDescriptiongtAustinHealyltDescriptiongt     ltMappinggt ltMappinggt     ltNcicCodegtJEEPltNcicCodegt     ltMncisCodegtJEEPltMncisCodegt     ltDescriptiongtJeep for model years 1989 throughresentltDescriptiongt ltMappinggt ltMappinggt     ltNcicCodegtJEPltNcicCodegt     ltMncisCodegtJEEPltMncisCodegt     ltDescriptiongtJeep for model years prior to 1970ltDescriptiongt ltMappinggt       ltMappinggt         ltNcicCodegtAUPRltNcicCodegt         ltMncisCodegtAUSTltMncisCodegt         ltDescriptiongtAustin Products, Inc.Subsidiary Austin Industries, Inc.ltDescriptiongt     ltMappinggt     ltMappinggt         ltNcicCodegtCHRSltNcicCodegt         ltMncisCodegtCHRYltMncisCodegt         ltDescriptiongtChrysler Boat Co.ltDescriptiongt     ltMappinggt     ltMappinggt         ltNcicCodegtCHRYltNcicCodegt         ltMncisCodegtCHRYltMncisCodegt         ltDescriptiongtChryslerltDescriptiongt     ltMappinggt ltVehicleMakeMappinggt codepre  pThese shows for example NCIC code MRCU has to be converted into DCCIS code MERC etc.p  pstrongXml docstrong  p  precode ltIntegration xmlnsmsxslurnschemasmicrosoftcomxslt xmlnstsghttptsgweb.com xmlnsIXMLhttptsgweb.com xmlnsCMCodeQueryHelperurnCMCodeQueryHelper PackageIDIXML Case Notification Test MessageID67078058 xmlnsgt ltCase InternalID1616807927 ID11747370 xmlnsuserhttptylertechnologies.comgt     ltCharge ID10547226 PartyID16580814 CurrSentenceID155092098 InternalChargeID1616447618 InternalPartyID1614482843 xmlnsresliburnreslibgt         ltChargeOffenseDategt03262014ltChargeOffenseDategt         ltVehiclegt             ltVehicleLicensePlateStategtDCltVehicleLicensePlateStategt             ltVehicleLicensePlateNumbergt050KTUltVehicleLicensePlateNumbergt             ltVehicleType WordPASSVEHgtJeep for model years prior to 1970ltVehicleTypegt             ltVehicleMake WordJEEPgtAustinHealyltVehicleMakegt             ltCommercialVehicleFlaggtfalseltCommercialVehicleFlaggt             ltHazardousVehicleFlaggtfalseltHazardousVehicleFlaggt             ltVehicleInactivegtfalseltVehicleInactivegt         ltVehiclegt     ltChargegt ltCasegt codepre  pp  pstrongxsltstrongp  precodeltxsltemplate nameChargeDetailsgt     ltextVehiclegt         ltncItemStyleTextgt             ltxslvalueof selectVehicleVehicleTypegt         ltncItemStyleTextgt         ltncVehicleCMVIndicatorgt             ltxslvalueof selectIntegrationCaseChargeVehicleCommercialVehicleFlaggt         ltncVehicleCMVIndicatorgt         ltjVehicleMakeCodegt             ltxslvariable namevVehicleMakegt         ltxslvalueof selectVehicleVehicleMakeWordgt                     ltxslvariablegt         ltxslvariable namevVehicleMakeCode selectdocumentconcatgEnvPath,SchemasCourtXMLConfigFilesVehicleMakeMapping.xmlVehicleMakeMappingMapping[MncisCodevVehicleMake]MncisCodegt           ltxslvalueof selectvVehicleMakeCodegt                       ltjVehicleMakeCodegt     ltextVehiclegt codepre  pp
Negative 162 pIve got an app set up, following the outline of a Udacity course. Theres a MainActivity and DetailActivity, both with fragment. The main side queries MediaStore.Images.Thumbnails and shows all thumbs in a GridView. When clicked, a URI is constructed with the codeIMAGEIDcode, and the DetailActivity is started. This shows the fullsize image  some metadata.p  pIm now wondering what itll take to make prev and next buttons in my detail UI. Clicking these will open the corresponding prev or next image in the detail UI. Technically, this means refreshing the ContentLoader with an updated URI. I just need some way to get the previous and next IMAGEID.p  pI guess I could do this all locally within the detailfragment, say by doing a query to get the next IDp  precodeSELECT MINIMAGEID NEXTID FROM thumbnails WHERE IMAGEID gt  ORDER BY DATE DESC codepre  pwhere Id plug in the current codeIMAGEIDcode as parameter. Then I could just construct the new URI, and restart the loader. Right Id have to figure out just how to implement this as a query to the Content Resolver, but I guess something like this emcouldem be done.p  pHowever, the MainActivity handles the onClick, which takes me to the DetailActivity thumb  image in the first place. It knows the codeint mPositioncode, even, of the GridView. Wouldnt it be a better solution to just ask the MainActivity or MainFragment to give me the prevnext IDs But then the question is, how do I call a method in MainFragment from DetailFragment Do I go via Fragment Manager, something like thisp  precodeFragment mainfrag  getActivity.getFragmentManager.findFragmentByTagMainFragment codepre  pAnd is it correct to get the prevnext IDs like thisp  precodeint prevId  mPosition1 int nextId  mPosition1 codepre  blockquote   pstrongUpdatestrong I tried adding a tag to each fragment, and use Fragment Manager to get a reference to the PhotoFragment from the DetailFragment, but I keep getting codenullcode when I dop      pcodePhotoFragment pf  PhotoFragment getActivity.getSupportFragmentManager.findFragmentByTagPHOTOFRAGMENTTAG   int position  pf.getPosition   crash pf  nullcodep      pIs this because, on a phone, the detail activityfragment emreplacesem the main activity, stopping it As you can see in MainActivity, below, I have a twopane UI on a larger screen but there on a tablet I get a ClassCastExceptionp      pjava.lang.ClassCastException com.example.android.galleri.app.DetailFragment cannot be cast to com.example.android.galleri.app.PhotoFragmentp blockquote  pAnyway, here is the outline of my project.

So, based on user twitter account, I want to be able to get user details e.g. email id, name, profile picture, birth date, gender etc.. and save those details in database.

Negative 162 pI am very new to audio processing. I created a program that records and streams audio emone wayem, and does not record on the other end. Basically, it transmit whatever is recorded in one location to another location. However, there are many circumstances where this program will also output the audio in the same location as the recording source. This creates a noticeable echo because of the audio delay which is dependent on many factors.p  pBecause Im not sure if anything else is out there, I am trying to use WebRTCs audio processing module for Gain Control and acoustic echo cancellation. The gain control seems to work well, but the AEC doesnt really work so well. Im assuming maybe its because I am not setting the correct stream delay, or maybe this isnt really what AEC is for.p  pThe current code that Im using reads something Ive recorded from a file in an attempt to get rid of the echo, at least the first occurrence of it. If I set the stream delay to 0. as we can imagine the current audio gets cancelled out completely. I try different values to not much avail.p  pSo my question is, and I hope this is specific enough, what am I doing wrong in this model herep  precodevoid start char inFilename, char outFilename       FILE infile  fopen inFilename, rb      FILE outfile  fopen outFilename, wb        Our frame manager     AudioFrame frame     frame.audioChannel  CHANNELS     frame.frequencyInHz  SAMPLERATE     frame.payloadDataLengthInSamples  SAMPLERATE100  Math for 20ms frames       Get the size of our frames     const sizet frameLength  frame.payloadDataLengthInSamplesCHANNELS       AudioProcessing apm  AudioProcessingCreate0          apmgtsetsampleratehz SAMPLERATE   Superwideband processing.

Negative 162 pI have a simple virtual machine which I made for fun. It works in a very low level and it doesnt have any notion of types. Everything is just an integer. There are some instructions for getting a pointer and accessing memory by a pointer. The problem is that these pointers are simply stored as codeuint64tcode, and any pointer arithmetic is an integer arithmetic. The machine casts this to a codevoidcode when using it as a pointer. Well, this kind of code is obvious in the assembly level, but the C and C standard doesnt let programmers do integerpointer cast safely, especially when the integer is used to change the value of the pointer.p  pIm not making this toy VM portable everywhere. It is just expected to work under x863264 machines, and it does seem to work very fine even after full compiler optimizations. I think its because pointers are represented no differently as integers in the x86 architecture.p  pWhat kind of solution is usually applied in such situations, that the language standards doesnt declare certain code as safe, but it really should be safe in the targeted hardware, and the results does seem okayp  pOr as a more practical question, how can I let a compiler gcc not perform breaking optimizations on code likep  precodeuint64t registers[0x100] registers[0]  uint64tmalloc8 registers[0]  4 registers[2]  0 memcpyampregisters[2], voidregisters[0], 4 codepre  pThe above isnt real code, but a certain sequence of bytecode instructions would actually do something similar as above.p

However, when I debug, passwordHash is not a property of codethiscode, it is property of codethis.doccode. p  pAm I going crazy or did it used to be another way with Mongoose and MongoDBp

Negative 162 pI have a graph structure with a root node, several container nodes Ill call them lvl1 each containing hundreds of thousands of content nodes lvl2. The content nodes may be linked with arbitrary numbers of other content nodes. Lvl1 nodes will never link to each other and link to their lvl2 nodes exactly once. When the graph gets constructed, links between lvl2 nodes may appear multiple times, in that case I need to keep count of the links increment a codedepthcode property on the appropriate edge. Also the order of construction will be quite random.p  pIm looking for an efficient way to manage that graph structure with orientDB. Building it up is eays, the problem is updating lvl2 nodes adding more links and links between them.p  pOne way to select could be a standard SQLquery, something like codeSELECT FROM lvl2nodes WHERE id  114code  but this would query the whole dataset and be very slow, as far as I can see I didnt test that yet.p  pSo my idea was to use index lookups. I created automatic indexing codeCREATE INDEX lvl2node.id UNIQUEcode and tried to query that codeSELECT FROM INDEXlvl2node.id WHERE key  114code, which gives me a tuple codekey 114, rid ltODocument lvl2node81id114,in[2],out[1] v1gtcode.p  pNow, how can I p  pa use that information to select a node and update its properties and p  pb find the edge between 2 such vertices to perform an update similarlyp  pOr is there a better method to update a graphs vertices, exploiting the graph structure A lvl1 nodes will still contain very many links that would need to be traversed without the hashmaps approach.p  pIm using Clojures cljorient API to access orientDB.p
Negative 162 pIn the following code i check if the graph contains cycle or not and it is working 100, but i do want to modify it so instead of printing Yes, i want it to print the first node of the repetition of the cycle.

Negative 162 pWant to warn you that it relates to MS Access SQL, so full outer join and some other nice stuff doesnt work here. The code below by my idea creates dictionary of tuples from an initial query, then refines it into the next dictionary by selecting those LKAK that have multiple values of ChainClIt could have only 2 possible values, but for each LKAK must be one value of ChainCl, so I do query that finds mistakes for me. My goal is, relying on that final dictionarylist of LKAK, to get records with those LKAK from the MSFLT query all of them are there, dictionary made of its values and RCFLT query values from dictionary are present there partially, but still are. Creation of final dictionary works just fine and instant. However, when I come to withdrawing the records, query run for about 20 min through 130000 records. What could be done to optimize the speed in connection between dictionary and source query. Note that adding distinct after the first select doesnt change run speed significantly. My problem is that I need to get joined results using union from three sameway formatted tablesqueriessay, RC,RW,RE, and if one takes 20 min, then three is an hour. This thing is quite useful for me and possibly others as a workaround for cases when you need to display extra data that doesnt take part in criteria involving totals needed group bylike count. Creation of additional query wont work for me either as I need to collect them within the single complex querydont like the idea, but thats the requirement. So, any suggestions on optimizationp  precodeselect distinct     RCFLT.LKAK as DataKeyAccount,     MSFLT.LKAK as MasterKeyAccount,     RCFLT.LSTCK as DataSubTradeChannel,     MSFLT.LSTCK as MasterSubTradeChannel,     RCFLT.UFPCh as DataUFPChannel,     MSFLT.UFPCh as MasterUFPChannel,     RCFLT.ChainCl as DataChainClass,     MSFLT.ChainCl as MasterChainClass,     RCFLT.Mkt as MarketUnit from      RCFLT,     MSFLT where     RCFLT.LSTCKMSFLT.LSTCK     and RCFLT.LKAKMSFLT.LKAK      and RCFLT.ChainClMSFLT.ChainCl      and MSFLT.LKAK in         SELECT LKAK         FROM              select distinct LKAK, ChainCl             from MSFLT         group by LKAK         having countLKAKgt1 codepre  pPS In both initial queries, fields used are there, but there are other fields as well.p

The replies suggest that, unless the function is called through a function pointer, the unused arguments will be optimized out by the compiler. p  pHowever, consider the following text in Section 2.5 of strongModern Cstrong by Alexandrescup  blockquote   pNow say there is a rule in your application Objects of type Widget are untouchable legacy code and must take two arguments upon construction, the second being a fixed value such as 1. Your own classes, derived from Widget, dont have this problem.p      p...p      pIn the absence of partial specialization of functions, the only tool available is, again, overloading. A solution would be to pass a dummy object of type T and rely on overloadingp  precodetemplate ltclass T, class Ugt T Createconst Uamp arg, T  dummy      return new Targ  template ltclass Ugt Widget Createconst Uamp arg, Widget  dummy      return new Widgetarg, 1  codepre      pstrongSuch a solution would incur the overhead of constructing an arbitrarily complex object that remains unusedstrong.p blockquote  pThis suggests that the compilers are not smart enough to avoid the construction of the argument for the dummy parameter...p  pSo, which is correct If Alexandrescu is correct, then why doesnt this optimization happenp
