Positive 73524 pI want to completely remove an Activity from the Task Stack, but finish only seems to minimize the Task. If I click on the button on my phone that browses all the open Tasks, its still there. I would need to swipe it away to get rid of it.p  pHow do I actually get rid of an Activity completely Currently I have ActivityA that launches ActivityB. When I press back, ActivityB minimizes and ActivityA is brought to the front. How do I make it simply get rid of ActivityB and return to ActivityAp

But is there a way to check if the current views in the window are in such lock state or not Im trying to invoke a method like thisp  precodeprivate void replaceView      Window window  getActivity.getWindow     WindowManager wm  getActivity.getWindowManager     wm.removeViewImmediatewindow.getDecorView     wm.addViewwindow.getDecorView, window.getAttributes  codepre  pNow in certain use cases like orientation change, when the above method is called for the first time, I get a crash.p  precodejava.lang.IllegalArgumentException Viewcom.android.internal.policy.impl.PhoneWindowDecorVieweebbc2d V.ED....

Positive 73524 pI will explain what I want to achieve by this imagep  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comykKtP.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comykKtP.png altenter image description hereap  pWhen someone starts the app for the first time, setup activity will open and I want it to have multiple steps. I guess creating activity for each part of the setup is not the best solution. I would prefer if the activity would just transform to the part 2 without any animation or with a sliding animation and I want it to only change the setup part by pressing the buttons. Whats the best  easiest way to achieve this Thanks for any answers.p

Negative 73524 pIn the past few years Ive mostly done UI development in Eclipse, which is very conservative in terms of thread access any attempt to change a property on a UI widget e.g., color, text from outside the UI thread throws an exception.p  pI am now looking at an existing program in Swing that has a window with a large number of custom widget. There is a separate threads that runs a mutation function for each of these widgets, and the mutation function reads the value of some things e.g., label colors and values and writes some e.g., changes background colors. Note that there is no custom painting involved or anything like that, just a bunch of changes to the sub widgets it contains which are mostly JLabels. p  pAt present, this runs from the separate thread, not from the Swing event thread. This thread goes over all the 400 widgets and calls the mutator on each. The updates seem to work correctly, but the GUI is unresponsive to user input. p  pIf I take the whole thing, which runs for about 0.4 msec from outside the Swing thread and wrap every call to a mutator in an invokeLater or invokeAndWait, the UI is a lot more responsive.p  pWhat Im trying to understand isp  p1 Is it sometimes legitimate to make all these calls from outside the Swing threadp  p2 What is the impact on the Swing thread and why is the UI less responsive when I call it from outside p

Negative 73524 pI was told by a consultant in a 3 hours discussion that basically blackberry 3rd party apps Distributed through AppWorld or not strongcannotstrong perform any network IO outside of North America without becoming an alliance member. Is this truep  pBasically the story is that only North America can make use of APN connection, anywhere else in the world you have to rely on BIS for your network connection. And the network connection over BIS can only be made to a server that is provisioned by RIM. You will have to become and alliance member in order to have your server provisioned. p  pThis sounds kinda silly to me, because if I am a third party developer I cannot do network io at all outside of NA. Thats a huge limitation on the AppWorld developersp  phrp  pIm not talking about a network socket over Wifi connection, only concerned with network connectivity over the cell network.p

Negative 73524 pMy prototype displays documents that contain pages that are  represented by thumbnail images. Each document can have any number of pages. For example, there might be  1000 documents with 5 pages each, or 5 documents with 1000 pages each, or somewhere inbetween. Documents do not contain other documents. In my xaml markup I have a codeListBoxcode, whose codeItemsTemplatecode  references an innerItemsTemplate that also has a codeListBoxcode. I want the 2 levels of selected items so that I can perform various operations on documents or pages delete, merge, move to new location, etc. The innerItemsTemplate codeListBoxcode uses a codeWrapPanelcode as the codeItemsPanelTemplatecode.p  pFor the scenario where I have a large number of documents with a few pages each say, 10000 documents with 5 pages each, the scrolling works great thanks to the UI Virtualization by the codeVirtualizingStackPanelcode. However, I have problems if I have a large number of pages. A document with 1000 pages will only display about 50 at a time whatever fits on the screen, and when I scroll down, the outer codeListBoxcode moves to the next document, skipping the 950 pages or so that were not visible. Along with that, there is no codeVirtualzingWrapPanelcode so the app memory really increases.p  pIm wondering if I am going about this the right way, especially since it is sort of difficult to explain I would like to be able to display 10000 documents with 1000 pages each only showing whatever fits on the screen, using UI Virtualization, and also smooth scrolling.p  pHow can I make sure the scrolling moves through all of the pages in document  before it displays the next document, and still keep UI virtualization The scrollbar seems to only move to the next document.p  pDoes it seem logical to represent documents and pages  with my current method of using a codeListBoxcode within a codeListBoxcodep  pI would very much appreciate any ideas you have. Thank You.p

Negative 73524 pI am trying to write a graphics application in C. It currently uses OGRE for display, but Id like it to work with Irrlicht or any other engine, even a custom rendering engine which supports my needs. This is a rather long question, so Id appreciate help on retagging cleanup if necessary. Ill start with a little background.    p  pThe application has three major statesbr 1. Display rasterized scenebr 2. Display a ray traced version of the same scenebr 3. Display a hybrid version of the scene  p  pClearly, I can divide my application into four major partsbr 1. A state management system to switch between the above modes.br 2. An input system that can receive both keyboard and mouse input.br 3. The raster engine used for display.br 4. The ray tracing system.  p  pAny application encompassing the above needs to be able tobr 1. Create a window.br 2. Do all the steps needed to allow rendering in that window.br 3. Initialize the input system.br 4. Initialize the state manager.br 5. Start looping and rendering.p  pI want to be able to change the rendering enginestate managerinput system ray tracing system at any time, so long as certain minimum requirements are met. Imho, this requires separating the interface from the implementation. With that in mind, I created the interfaces for the above systems. p  pAt that point, I noticed that the application has a common interface as well. So I thought to abstract it out into an ApplicationBase class with virtual methods. A specific application, such as one which uses OGRE for window creation, rendering etc would derive from this class and implement it.p  pstrongMy first question is  is it a good idea to design like thisstrongp  pHere is the code for the base class  p  precodeifndef APPLICATIONH   define APPLICATIONH   namespace Hybrid       Forward declarations         class StateManager     class InputSystem      Base Class for all my apps using hybrid rendering.     class Application              private             StateManager statemanager             InputSystem inputsystem         public             Application                              try                                      Create the state manager                     initialisestatemanager                     Create the input system                     initialiseinputsystem                                  catch...

This requires OGRE to be initialised before the createWindow function is called in my derived class. Of course, as it is, createWindow is going to be called first That leaves me with the following optionsbr 1. Leave the base class constructor empty.br 2. In the derived class implementation, make initialising OGRE part of the createWindow function.br 3. Add an initialize render system pure virtual function to my base class. This runs the risk of forcing a dummy implementation in derived classes which have no use for such a method.  p  pstrongMy second question is what are your recommendations on the choice of one of these strategies for initialising OGREstrongp

I get several services instantiated in my controller class by structure map, but I want them to share methods that are base hint to all services. How can I achieve this Using a base class does not really work or do I have to reflect on the type because the base class methods will not be available in the interface description that defines the service. Do I have to add the method signature into every interface I want to have all Service classes return their availability e.g. bool upandrunning.p  pAny hintsp

Geocoding responses with an codeaccuracycode equal to or grater than 4 citylocality level are used as starting points, and the surrounding rental stations searched.p  pThe application is supposed to work in Germany. When a locality name is ambiguous i.e. there are more than one place of that name I want to display a list of possibilities.p  pThat is not a problem in general If you make an ambiguous search, Googles XML output returns a list of codeltPlaceMarkgtcode elements instead of just one.p  pObviously, I need to bias the geocoding towards Germany, so if somebody enters a postcode or the name of a locality that exists in other countries as well, only hits in Germany actually come up.p  pI thought I could achieve this by adding code, decode or code, Deutschlandcode to the search query.

So I have the following structure definitionp  precodetypedef struct    union      unsigned char  reg0aPtr     unsigned char  reg0bPtr    RegsAddrOffset0    union      unsigned char  reg1aPtr     unsigned char  reg1bPtr    RegsAddrOffset1    ...    union      unsigned char  reg7aPtr     unsigned char  reg7bPtr    RegsAddrOffset7  DeviceRegMap codepre  pThen if I declare a variable as sop  precodeDeviceRegMap  uartRegMap  DeviceRegMap 0xD0000000 codepre  pNow, if I try to to use the uartRegMap variable to access the memory mapped registers I thought I would see that uartRegMapRegsAddrOffset0.reg0aPtr would read the data from address 0xD0000000, which is does.  If I use uartRegMapRegsAddrOffset1.reg1bPtr I thought I would access 0xD0000001, but it is actually accesses address 0xD0000004.  Since the processor is 32bit the natural alignment is 4bytes.  I am thinking since the size of a pointer is an int which in this case is 32bits this is the reason why I am accessing on 4byte address ranges e.g., 0xD0000000, 0xD0000004, 0xD0000008, etc.p  pIf I declared an instance of the DeviceRegMap datatype I would expect the following initializationp  precodeDeviceRegMap uartRegMap     unsigned char  0xD0000000,   unsigned char  0xD0000001,   ...   unsigned char  0xD0000007,  codepre  pThen if I wanted to access address 0xD0000007 then I would use uartRegMap.RegsAddrOffset7.reg7bPtrp  pThe question is why is the pointer to the DeviceRegMap data type access memory on 4byte alignments e.g., 0xD0000000, 0xD0000004, etc instead of byte alignments e.g., 0xD0000000, 0xD0000001, etc.  With regards to the toolset I am using Wind River diab compiler.  Thanks.p  pMarkp  pEDIT Based upon abelenkys commentp

Negative 73524 pstrongBasic versionstrong Is there a lightweight C.NET library that can be used in an ASP.NET MVC app to service WFS requestsp  pstrongDetailed versionstrong  We are developing a C ASP.NET MVC app that sits on top of a Sql Server 2008 database with some basic geospatial data.  I need to be able to display a map with our simple pointline features DB entities over a map background in the browser.  The plan is to use a hrefhttpopenlayers.orgOpenLayersa to render the map.  The background map is being provided by a thirdparty using WMS so I know I can connect to and display that OK.p  pThe problem I have is that the data we wish to show over the map need to be filtered by the user its currently shown in tabular form.  It appears that I really need to expose a WFS service to allow the user to filter data for display on the map.p  pIs there a lightweight and ideally free C component that can do this  I have had a brief play with a hrefhttpsharpmap.codeplex.comSharpMapa which is largely suitable for our needs, but while I can use it to render a map and our data Ive not been able to figure out how to apply filters which will vary request to request to the rendered data.  Alternatively does anyone have any other suggestionsp  pIm trying to avoid use of fullscale geoservers e.g. GeoServer, MapServer, etc. if possible as our requirements are quite basic and we have various infrastructure constraints.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 73524 pI have a Spring MVC app where I am using a singleton bean that stores a large hashmap object. I am using NeoDats object DB to persist this as it is a sort of search engine application and we are using it so that we can search through the hashmap object its more complex than boolean keyword search engine, this hashmap object is frequently updated with data from the user tags that they add to the categorize data The issue I currently is that I had been persisting the hashmap object to the NeoDatis DB based on user actions, but since it can take a few seconds to save the large object, this runs into issues sometimes if the user saves too fast.p  pWhat I would like to do is remove the connection between user action and saving this hashmap object and rather make it something that occurs automatically, such as every 5 seconds. I may have to do this soon as we may be expanding the app to run on more than one server so there would be a somewhat complex system for synchronizing these hashmap objects between systems and having user actions for saving the DB would make it too unreliable, I think.p  pI am not quite sure how to approach this, I dont think threading will work because its a singleton bean instance so I dont know if I can gain access to that through the thread as the data in the hashmap object would change after the thread was started. Any advice on how to approach this  resources is greatly appreciatedp

Negative 73524 pI recently handed in a project for school which I built in CodeIgniter. I had to present it to my teacher and when asked how I handled certain errors, he told me to throw exceptions to intercept things a lot earlier in the chain of events.p  pI have learnt how to throw exceptions and how to use codetry...catchcode blocks to uh, catch and handle them but somehow, when I started using CodeIgniter, I forgot all about them and didnt really use exceptions anymore. p  pInstead, I just handled my errors manually, for lack of a better word Id use codeTRUEcodeand codeFALSEcode boolean values to check if, for example, a query executed properly, and I would use the returned boolean to handle the result of the query. If codeTRUEcode, Id go ahead and do my stuff, if codeFALSEcode Id manually throw an error message. The project was very AJAXdependent and the error messages would pop up in quite a fancy way, dropping down from the top of the page not sure if this is possible when I throw an exception with codethrow new Exceptioncode I know that this basically stops the code from executing when the exception is thrown, so wouldnt that break things somehowp  pI also seem to remember reading somewhere that throwing exceptions isnt the best practice ever but I cant find the source of this anymore and Im not quite sure if this is the case after all, we did learn how to use them in class and I like to believe we learn best practices there, haha.p  pIf necessary, I could go back and try to find the piece of code where he pointed out that I shouldve thrown an exception. However, for now, Im just wondering whether or not I should use exceptions in my code or handle things manually. What are the best practices regarding thisp  pThanks.p

Negative 73524 pI have successfully written a new Chronology that represents my companys fiscal calendar, based off of JodaTime.  I referred to the JodaTime source code quite a bit, to figure out what I needed to do.  One of the things I noticed in the codeBasicChronologycode class was the use of the inner class codeYearInfocode to cache the firstDayOfYearMillis  the number of milliseconds since 19700101 ISO.  Figuring that, if it was enough of a performance bottleneck that JodaTime was caching it, I should probably add it to my chronology too.br When I did so, though, I made some modifications.  Specifically, I moved the codegetYearInfocode method into the codeYearInfocode inner class, as well as making it static.  I also moved the array used to store the cached values into the inner class as well.  Full definition of the modified class is like this p  precode   Caching class for firstdayofyear millis.     private static final class YearInfo              Cache setup for firstdayofyear milliseconds.           private static final int CACHESIZE  1 ltlt 10     private static final int CACHEMASK  CACHESIZE  1     private static transient final YearInfo[] YEARINFOCACHE  new YearInfo[CACHESIZE]             Storage variables for cache.           private final int year     private final long firstDayMillis     private final boolean isLeapYear              Create the stored year information.              param inYear The year to store info about.           private YearInfofinal int inYear          this.firstDayMillis  calculateFirstDayOfYearMillisinYear         this.isLeapYear  calculateLeapYearinYear         this.year  inYear                  Get year information.              param year The given year.              return Year information.           private static YearInfo getYearInfofinal int year          YearInfo info  YEARINFOCACHE[year amp CACHEMASK]         if info  null  info.year  year              info  new YearInfoyear             YEARINFOCACHE[year amp CACHEMASK]  info                  return info       codepre  pMy question is... What are the performance or design implications of my changes  Ive already decided that my changes should be threadsafe given answers about final member variables.  But why was the original implementation done the way it was, and not like this  I get why most of the methods that are being used effectively staticly arent given subclasses of codeBasicChronologycode, but Ill admit that some of my OO design stuff is a little rusty having spent the last two years using RPG.br So... thoughtsp

Negative 73524 pI am seeing a strange problem in my project where perl could not see a file though it is present in the disk.  We run a series of short backend jobs  each spanning 10 s  through perl. The backend job write an output file and exit, later which perl process would try to transfer it. The job runs fine initially and all of a sudden fail to detect file written by the backend. Debugging perl code  5.10.1 from a hrefhttpwww.cpan.orgsrc relnofollowhttpwww.cpan.orgsrca , I found stati64  win32stat in win32.c  fail and return 1. On retry, the call seem to work fine. I can guarantee there there is no race condition involved by backend process as we try to access the file in perl only after backend exit.p  pDoes anyone know conditions when used recursively in short jobs under which stat  or stati64  can say file absent though file exist in windows Does it cache the result of previous execution for optimizationp

The data will be collected, escaped and inserted like HTML  PHP  MySQL. The IDs should be in the format depicted above, four letters, then four numerics initially at least  when I reach codesmit9999code it will just spill over into 5 digits.p  pI can deal with generating the 4 letters from the company name, I will simply step through the name until I have collected 4 alpha characters, and codestrtolowercode it  but then I need to get the next available number.p  pWhat is the besteasiest way to do this, so that the possibility of duplicates is eliminatedp  pAt the moment Im thinkingp  precodefourLetters  smit query  SELECT companyref             FROM companies           WHERE             companyref LIKE fourLetters           ORDER BY companyref DESC           LIMIT 1 last  mysqlifetchassocmysqliquerylink, query newNum  int ltrimsubstrlast[companyref],4,0  1 newRef  fourLetters.strpadnewNum, 4, 0, STRPADLEFT codepre  pBut I can see this causing a problem if two users try to enter company names that would result in the same ID at the same time.

Negative 73524 pMy application takes a checkpoint every few 100 milliseconds by using the strongforkstrong system call. However, I notice that my application slows down significantly when using checkpointing forking. I tested the time taken by strongforkstrong call and it came out to be 1 to 2 ms. So why is strongforkstrong slowing down my application so much. Note that I only keep 1 checkpoint forked process at a time and kill the previous checkpoint whenever I take a new one. Also, my computer has a huge RAM. p  pNotice that my forked process just sleeps after creation. It is only awoken when rollback needs to be done. So, it should not be scheduled by the OS. One thing that comes to my mind is that since strongforkstrong is a copyonwrite mechanism, there are page faults occuring whenever my application modifies a page. But should that slow down the application significantly Without checkpointing forking, my application finishes in approximately 3.1 seconds and with it, it takes around 3.7 seconds. Any idea, what is slowing down my applicationp

Negative 73524 pstrongWhat I wantstrong I have an EditText, where the user can enter a value, such as 10.40. Once the user is done editing I am formatting his input to a currency, for instance the above mentioned value would get formatted to 10.40 in the case of Locale.US. And I display that result in the same EditText that the user previously edited.p  pstrongProblemstrong Because I am going to format i.e. modify his input, I need to know when hes done so my formatting does not interfer with his ongoing input. p  pstrongWhat I triedstrong TextWatcher is not an option, since it fires on every single edit, hence when the user enters one, zero, four, dot and zero 10.40. I am currently using an OnFocusChangeListener which works as desired, BUT the problem is I have buttons in my application and if the user clicks on a button after editing the EditText the EditText wont lose Focus, hence my formatting code never gets called ...p  pAfter this I tried messing around with the buttons focus, setting it to FocusableInTouchMode  which results in the button having to be clicked twice in order to fire which is a no go, since it gains focus the first time and gets activated the second time. After so much hacking around I was wondering if anyone got an idea as how to solve this dilemma.p  pstrongSome Codestrongp  pI add the following OnFocusChangeListener to my EditText whose function I described above.

Negative 73524 pSuppose I have domaina.com A and domainb.com Bp  pId like to be able to share php sessions between the two domains unifying logins in a way that once the user is logged to A is automatically logged into B and vice versa.p  pNow, the problem Im facing is that even if I managed to have the browser talk via ajax to an external domain via the AccessControlAllowOrigin header it wont set cookies please dont tell me you cant setget cookies for another domain, this is not the problemp  pheres the flowp  pA sends credentials to Bp  pif credentials are OK p  pB answers with emtheem SESSID made in order to be consistent with the user credentials so that it can be generated both ways ie login from A or login from B, this will be used later to share the session created on Bp  pAt the same time Id like that B could write cookies for its domain, but so far I wasnt able.p  pWhat I need here is very simple, once that the credentials from A are correct id like that server B could write his cookie for his domain B, I can see from the headers that technically its setting cookies, but the browser isnt really listening. any idea am I playing in a dangerous zone of incompatibilities between browsers technically all of this should be pretty vanilla for the recent browsers.p  pthanksp

For example, codeFri Jan 20 2012 115136 GMT0500code in GMT is codeFri Jan 20 2012 165136 GMTcode not codeFri Jan 20 2012 065136 GMTcode. GMT0500 is behind GMT, not ahead, so you have to add the offset to get GMT, not subtract it.p
Negative 73524 pI want to create a system wide minimizeinplace feature that occurs when doubleclicking the title bar of any visible window in layer 0.p  pIt seems that this would be a really simple feature to reimplement... When a  titlebar is doubleclicked, just draw the title bar only. Thats it.  The problem is implimenting it in all applications. I think it requires writting a custom framework to override the behavior in AppKit Maybe NSApplication, NSWindow or NSViewp  pstrongHow can I recreate minimizeinplacestrong Is a framework my only choice If I create a framework, can I replace the behavior of minimize in 3rd party appsp  pWhich framework do I need to override in order to intercept and recreate the default behavior of the minimize buttonp  pstrongMore about minimizeinplacestrong I am familiar with WindowShade by Unsanity, this is exactly what I  want to create. Supposedly unsanity is working on a Lion version, but  their track record is bismal. Minimizeinplace was a system feature way  back in the days of OS 7 or 8. I have tried other utilities that try to  replace this feature, and there arent any that do minimizeinplace at  a core system level like it needs to be done. Please dont offer  utitlity suggestions, I am going to build my own.p  pstrongI have built an Application that recreates minimizeinplace, but its not good enough.strong My Application semisuccessfully recreates minimizeinplace by putting placeholder windows belonging to my app in place of the 3rd party windows when they get minimized to dock. When my window title bar only gets doubleclicked, I close my window and restore the real window from the dock.p  pMy custom app works perfectly, but there is a lot of application switching going on. I have optimized the switching between apps to be nearly seamless, but the fact remains that there is application switching going on every time a window title bar is doubleclicked. The result of application switching is that menu bars switch back and forth, pallets of 3rd party apps hide themselves when my app takes focus, and the list goes on.p  pSo, although Ive built a concept app, this method isnt going to work as Id like it to. Minimizeinplace needs to be implemented using some other method than building an Application, and I need help understanding how to do it.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comt2arB.jpg altminimizeinplace demo appp  pstrongWhat I know think I need to do. Suggestions and assistance welcome.strong I think I need to write a custom framework that replaces AppKit This seems overwhelming even though I only need a supertiny portion of the code to be overridden i.e. the core minimize function whatever that may be.p  pWhen a titlebar of 3rd party window is doubleclicked, just clip to the title bar and let the rest of the system function as normal. On unminimize double click 2nd time, set clip back to full window.p  pSimple rightp  pThanks for any assistancesuggestions,p  pChrisp

Negative 73524 pWhile walking through a sample code application for the iPhone, I found a pair of sendreceive methods that effectively had the same signature definitions, with the exception of the value types associated for one of the variables.  p  pFrom within the headerp  precode voidreceivedData unsigned char data lengthNSUIntegerlen  voidsendData     uint8t       data lengthNSUInteger len codepre  pThese methods are used as wrappers for a sendingreceiving process, which effectively is passing around a pointer to a codebytecode array of data being written to and from data streams.   I found these method signatures to be a bit curious and since Im new to CocoaCocoa Touch dev, I decided to check out the definition of the codeuint8tcode type.  I discovered that the codeuint8tcode is defined as an codeunsigned charcode within codestdint.hcode and, therefore, the codedatacode variables for these methods are exactly the same.  At least, that is the case for the codestdint.hcode that is being linked within XCode 4.2.p  pHowever, doing a bit of further research regarding the codeuint8tcode type I found a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1725855uint8tvsunsignedcharthis questiona regarding codeuint8tcode vs. codeunsigned charcode usage.  The consensus seems to be that quite often these two value types are exactly the same but with some implementations of the C standard libraries, they emmightem be different.  Ergo, one should not trust that they will be the same type of data when generating portable code.p  pWith that said, is it safe to assume from within an AppleObjectiveC programming environment that the codeuint8tcode will be the same as an codeunsigned charcode or should I follow the same advice given within the above mentioned question p  pThis may seem like a picky question to ask, but since I may be integrating libraries where this type of coding misconduct appears to be a bit prevalent into a personal codebase that could be used in multiple, Apple environments for quite a few years to come, I wanted further commentary.p

Negative 73524 pWere creating a click tracking app, that builds heatmaps. Im writing a script which users are suppose to insert into their pages for tracking to work. p  pIt works fine on elements, which doesnt require a redirect or form submit. For example, if I click on codeh1code or codepcode or whatever, it works perfectly correct. But, if I click on a codeacode, request to our server never happens before the normal redirect. p  pIn the last couple of days I tried a lot of ways to do that. First of, I tried a normal AJAX call, since it was a crossdomain request I had to use JSONP, but again, that AJAX call did not have time to execute before the redirect. Adding codeasync falsecode would have solved the problem, but it doesnt work with JSONP requests. So I decided to add a flag variable which indicates that it is safe to move on with redirect and used an empty while loop to wait until it becomes try in the ajax callback. But the while loop was blocking the execution flow, so callback never got a chance to set that variable to codetruecode. Here is some simplified codep  precodedocument.onclick, function e      part of the code is omitted      .ajax         url baseUrl,         data data,         type get,         dataType jsonp,         crossDomain true,         complete function xhr, status,              itsSafeToMoveOn  true                    whileitsSafeToMoveOn      return true  codepre  pThe next thing I tried is to use codeunloadcode page event to wait until total ajax calls in progress would become zero I had a counter implemented and then to move on with redirect. It worked in Firefox and IE, but in WebKit there was this errorp  precodeError Too much time spent in unload handler codepre  pAfter that I realized that I dont care about the server response and using codeimg.srccode for the request would be an ideal fit for this case. So at this point code looks like thisp  precodedocument.clickfunction e      part of the code is ommited     new Image.src  baseUrl    data      if tag  a  clickedElement.parents.hasa          sleep100            return true  codepre  pThat way I increased the overall script performance slightly, but problem with links remains unchanged. The codesleepcode function appears to be also blocking the execution flow and request never happens.p  pThe only idea left is to return codefalsecode from the event handler and than redirect manually to the clicked elements codehrefcode or to call codesubmitcode on the form, but it will complicate things to much and believe me its already a huge pain in the ass to debug this script in different browsers.  p  pDoes anyone have any other ideasp

Negative 73524 pIm working on a practice program at InterviewStreet and I have a solution that runs with a time of 5.15xx seconds, while the maximum time allowed for a java solution is 5 seconds. Is there anything I can do with what Ive got here to get it under 5 seconds Theres also a limit of 256 MB so as near as I can tell this is both the most time and memory efficient solution to the problem...p  pedit The possible values for N and K are N lt 109 and K lt N, which is why I chose to do everything using BigInteger.  The maximum number of trials is 10000. So basically, you input the number of trials, then a pair of integer values for each number of trials, and the program computes the three versions of the binomial coefficient for the equation in the second loop. I figured it would be faster to read everything into the arrays, then process the arrays and put the results into a third array to be processed by the third loop because I figured it might be faster that way. I tried doing everything in the same loop and it ran slower.  p  pIve tried three or four different algorithms for calculating the binomial coefficient nCr  or n choose r, all are different ways of saying the same thing. Some of the algorithms involve a two dimensional array like c[n][k]. This is the only solution Ive submitted that didnt come back with some sort of memory error. The answer needs to be output mod 10  6  3 because the answers of nCr  nCr get pretty huge.

Negative 73524 pI have a kind of problem where there are two set of photos in my photo viewer. One is a retina image and another is a image with less resolution. the size of the placeholder is around 300X200. The no retina based image is exactly the same size 300X200 and retina images is almost double the size. My question is what problem will we face when a high resolution image is placed in a non retina image, i know the image will get displayed for sure, but i want to know what could be other hidden issues.p  pcan someone surely say that a high resolution image in the placeholder is not going to create any image that will be fine. i know my question looks real silly, but want to clear that up.p

Negative 73524 pI want to know how to implement a JPA EntityManager per user thread design. Since EM are light weight objects, it should not be an overhead to create them per user thread. The problem I want to solve is a single JSP page with multiple parallel JSONAJAX calls to backend services via controllers. p  pI am having an Entity Manager with persistence context EXTENDED, with Open EM In View Filter. It does work nice, but only when there is one user thread say, a json call per page, or in other words when I access em in serial fashion.  It does not however solve my purpose when I call my services from multiple threads as em instances are shared and I get weird errors sometimes shared access to collections, and sometimes closed connection, which are expected I believe.p  pI am using JPA over Spring 3 and hibernate 3.5. I inject an entity manager extended into my services as below p  precodePersistenceContexttype  PersistenceContextType.EXTENDED protected EntityManager em codepre  pMy readonly service methods are annotated asp  precodelttxmethod nameget readonlytrue propagationSUPPORTSgt codepre  pAll other methods, are annotated asp  precodelttxmethod name propagationREQUIRED rollbackforExceptiongt codepre  pI want to avoid an application managed em, and hence did not go for injecting a EntityManagerFactory instead. Also, If I choose to inject EntityManager into spring controller, I will still have issues when same controller is called in parallel from two threads p  pIs there an elegant way to achieve a thread safe access to em. I also want to avoid locking any entity objects, which complicates things further.p  pSince multiple ajax calls from same page is a very common design in modern web  applications, I believe there must be a simple and declarative way of achieving this without going back to managing hibernate sessions manually with interceptors etcp

Negative 73524 pI am starting a new enterprise web application. It will be hosted up on Windows Azure and will be an asp.net MVC application talking to an SQL database.p  pMy question relates to multitenancy and the correct way to accomplish it. In the past Ive created a multitenant application by having a tenant table and than putting a TenantID column in every table. This worked fine but it was only on a smaller scale so it didnt really exercise it to the nth degree. Looking into the multitenant stuff on Azure, it doesnt seem to recommend this way. They talk about subdomain, splitting tenants etc. To me, that just seems like a management nightmare. I would like the user to hit a website, enter their tenant login details and boom they are off.p  ol liIs there a simpler way to implement multitenancy in Azure that still allows me to use Azures scalability strengthsli liShould I just use the simple TenantID method Will the Azure framework still scale well to suitli liShould I worry about tenancy at the start or just leave it till the endli ol  pAdvice needed.p  pThanksp

Negative 73524 pI know you cant use asp net server tags in an external javascript file. This is a bit of pain, because it forces you to declare your variables that need ClientID in the aspx page and then you refer to them in the external javascript file. Not very clean. Currently I use script managers composite script to register my scripts... It would be nice if I could have the script injected and the server tags processed as if it was part of the page. Is this possible p  pI know there is RegisterClientScript but this doesnt seem to honor the script tags either. Im wondering if there is a solution someone has come up with to just pull the contents of the javascript file and shove them into the aspx page before its processed so that the server tags can be processed. Ive looked all over the web and dont see any good solution to this beyond using the server tags in the aspx page or generating the ids of controls, etc. server side and generating script. p
Negative 73524 pI have just started researching on OpenJPA, trying to understand if it addresses my needs.

How would it know if another storedprocedure updated same table before I do it Does it keep track of the state of my POJO object assume it is marked by Entity Does it query the table before calling any stored procedure that is mapped to it lets assume I tell JPA that this object can be mapped to which tablep  pThanksp

Right now I would like to do the same using ranges ie i specify the range in time.. read a small chunk of audio as per the time, and then go back and read again.

In my code youll notice that I start the AVAssetReader and end it every time I set a time range, and thats bc I cannot dynamically adjust the time range after the reader has started see a

As per the release notes sqljdbc.jar can be used with Java 5 and sqlserver4.jar can be used with Java 6 and 7.p  pMy current project compiles with Java5 so that our customers can run them in Java5 or Java6 or Java7 based on their webapplication server support. Current I create one war file for all webapp server. Since Microsoft offers different jars for various JDK are there any way to load appropriate sqljdbc jar based on the Java version with single deployment packagep  pI could create separate war file for Java5 and Java6 which could solve the problem but want to check with other to see are there any other option.p

Wouldnt it make more sense to define a codeprivate Number isPrimeFactor  new Numbercode at the top rather than making a new codeNumber isPrimeFactor  new Numbericode for every repetition of the loop I asked my teacher about this but he isnt really answering.

Negative 73524 pLets say I am creating a TODO list web application with following featuresp  ul lihave ability to registerlogin usersli lieach user has its own TODO list that is independent from other usersli ul  pSo Ive created a simple model that has class ToDoItem. p  pId like to use good practices so I created a generic repository that should fetch TODO items from databasep  precodepublic interface IRepositoryltTgt      IQueryableltTgt FindAll     IQueryableltTgt FindExpressionltFuncltT, boolgtgt predicate      void AddT newEntity     void RemoveT entity      T FindByIdlong id  codepre  pimplementation is done with EF and codefirst approach but thats not important right nowp  pThis repository will be injected into controller that allows user to list, add, remove, edit TODO items. This is done via custom controller factory Ive created that uses Ninject DI container to resolve repository interface to concrete implementation. So the controller looks like thisp  precodepublic class HomeController  Controller      IRepositoryltToDoItemgt repository     public HomeControllerIRepositoryltToDoItemgt repository              repository  repository            list all TODO items for this user     [Authorize]     public ActionResult ListItems              var todoItems  repository.FindAll         return ViewtodoItems        codepre  pMy question what is the best way to make controller return TODO list only for the currently logged in user Ideally Id like to have controller work with repository that is injected and preset with the currently logged user. In other words Id like to avoid this kind of code in action methodp  precode     list all TODO items for this user     [Authorize]     public ActionResult ListItems              var todoItems  repository.FindAllUser.Identity         return ViewtodoItems      codepre  pI was thinking that possible solution would be to make controller factory somehow know which user is logged so it would initialize concrete repository and set user ID so that controller doesnt have to do that in every action method. Would this be good approach and if so how can I implement it If not, what are better alternativesp

It doesnt bother whether machine can actually work on that condition or not. This is strategy pattern.p  pIn second implementation, machine it self can decide its state and work accordingly. It is also free to change its state between the process, if it requires. This is state pattern.p

Looping though and getting each parameter between the slashes just doesnt feel like the right way to do it. p  pSo I hit Google and it seems that sending the parameters from MODREWRITE seems like the way to do it. So my questions are, how is this possible, how is it donep  pHow do I get the parameters from the URL with MODREWRITE, send those to the PHP backend, then return a response to the front end with JSONp  pedit The problem I have is I need to pass Parameters from JS to a PHP back end then get a response. I originally got these parameters from the URL with JS, then passed them into the GET request, I would then get a response from the PHP depending on the Parameter sent. However now I have used modrewrite on the URL I can not see the parameters on the front end to catch in the traditional abampcd format. it now looks like bd To get these in JS I can only do this by looping through and getting each parameter between the slashes. Doesnt seem right to do it like this. I need to actually some how get the parameters to the PHP code in a separate page from the front end. Then pass it back to the front end with the response from the PHP code so I have lets say the users id. I dont want any php in the front end file as to keep it all separated. There must be a way to get the parameters from the url to the PHP code in a different file, then send back a response to the front end HTMLampJS with the usersid. Im new to this whole MODREWRITE for clean urls, and its confusing the hell out of mep

Negative 73524 pSo Ive been working on a GUI that has the basic layout completed.  I have the logic all mapped out but the issue I am having is figuring out how to set a filled array to a public variable with all of the String and ints placed in it remaining intact, and not having it kept blank.  By no means am I a pro with programming so please be patient if the answer is very obvious.  I will post the window that I am trying to get the filled array in a public variable.p  pthe public array robbieArray works soley in the main to output any values from it, but past that I cannot use it in frame.

Negative 73524 pI am using a jPlayer to show Video. It is shown on the page through a Javascript that assesses the browser before showing it. When the page has single Video, it shows fine, but when I want two videos to be shows, it shows weirdly. What it does is that when I show both the videos, it playspause the second video, when I playpause the first video. So, in short, It doesnt play the second video, but plays both videos when I play the first video.p  pTo show second video, I copied the first videos code and that is the reason why this is happening, but I did change all the IDs to make sure that it has its own parameters.p  pCould you have a look to see what I am missingp  pJS Codep  precodejQuerydocument.readyfunction       ifjqueryjplayer1[0] ampamp jplayerparameters ampamp videoparameters         jqueryjplayer1.jPlayer           ready function                 this.jPlayersetMedia,                    m4v jplayerparameters.m4v,                  flv videoparameters.src,                    poster jplayerparameters.poster                          ,           swfPath filesflv,           solutionflash,html,           supplied flv, m4v,            size                width jplayerparameters.width  544px,               height jplayerparameters.height  308px,               cssClass jpvideo           ,            canplay function  jqueryjplayer1.jPlayerplay ,            error function event                 if event.jPlayer.error.type  enosolution                    backupvideo.show                   jpcontainer1.hide                   swfobject.embedSWF                     httpspathvideoStrobeMediaPlayback.swf                     , StrobeMediaPlayback                     , videoparameters.width  544                     , videoparameters.height  308                     , 0.0.0                     , expressInstall.swf                     , videoparameters                     ,                          allowFullScreen true,                         allowscriptaccessalways,                         wmode transparent                                          ,                          name StrobeMediaPlayback                                                                                       Second Video Parameters      ifjqueryjplayer2[0] ampamp jplayerparameters2 ampamp videoparameters2         jqueryjplayer2.jPlayer           ready function                 this.jPlayersetMedia,                    m4v jplayerparameters2.m4v,                  flv videoparameters2.src,                    poster jplayerparameters2.poster                          ,           swfPath filesflv,           solutionflash,html,           supplied flv, m4v,            size                width jplayerparameters2.width  544px,               height jplayerparameters2.height  308px,               cssClass jpvideo           ,            canplay function  jqueryjplayer2.jPlayerplay ,            error function event                 if event.jPlayer.error.type  enosolution                    backupvideo2.show                   jpcontainer2.hide                   swfobject.embedSWF                     httpspathvideoStrobeMediaPlayback.swf                     , StrobeMediaPlayback                     , videoparameters2.width  544                     , videoparameters2.height  308                     , 0.0.0                     , expressInstall.swf                     , videoparameters2                     ,                          allowFullScreen true,                         allowscriptaccessalways,                         wmode transparent                                          ,                          name StrobeMediaPlayback                                                                            codepre  pBelow is the HTMLp  precodeltscript typetextjavascriptgt      var videoparameters            src httpspathuploadsvideosrisks.flv,                  autoPlay true,                verbose true,          controlBarAutoHide true,          controlBarPosition bottom,                      width 544,                     height 308          var jplayerparameters            m4v httpspathuploadsvideosrisks.m4v,                     width 544px,                     height 308px,                     poster httpspathuploadsimagesrisksvideocover.jpg            var videoparameters2            src httpspathuploadsvideosPeriscope.flv,                  autoPlay true,                verbose true,          controlBarAutoHide true,          controlBarPosition bottom,                      width 544,                     height 308          var jplayerparameters2            m4v httpspathuploadsvideosPeriscope.m4v,                     width 544px,                     height 308px,                     poster httpspathuploadsimagesvideocover1.jpg         ltscriptgt lth1 classentrytitlegtVideo interviewslth1gt ltpgtView interviews with T30 participants.

Negative 73524 pIve been asked by a client to solve the following pesky issue. They have a custom software that has a tendency of displaying message boxes left and right without any apparent reason. For instance, the software itself is an accounting program, and when they take a customers payment, the message box may be displayed about 3 or 4 times in a row. Each message box plays Windows default sound. Unfortunately the way this software was programmed, the type of sounds it plays is completely wrong. For instance, it may display a warning message box and play the warning system sound when the message itself is just an information. All this is quite annoying for the staff who uses the software.p  pI tried to contact the vendor who distributes the software, but I hit a deadend with them. So now I am looking for ways to mitigate this issue.p  pMy easiest solution was to suggest to mute the speakers, but unfortunately, they require sound to be present to be able to hear incoming emails, and most importantly, be able to play voice mail from them later. So my solution was to somehow mute message box sounds just for a single process.p  pFrom my experience, I know that therere two APIs that may be producing these sounds a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopms68035628vvs.8529.aspx relnofollowMessageBeepa and an older a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopms67927728vvs.8529.aspx relnofollowBeepa.p  pI also found a hrefhttpwww.codeproject.comArticles49319EasywaytosetupglobalAPIhooks relnofollowthis articlea that explains how to use AppInitDLLs to hook to system APIs. It works great, except that both of the APIs that I need to hook to come from User32.dll and not from kernel32.dll like the author suggests.p  pTheres also a hrefhttpwww.codeproject.comArticles49319EasywaytosetupglobalAPIhooksmsg4342850xx4342850xx relnofollowthis posta in the questions section that kinda gives approximate steps to hooking to an API from User32.dll, but when I tried to implement them, theres not enough information for my knowledge to do it.p  pSo my questions is, does anyone know how to hook to an API in the User32.dll modulep  pstrongEDITstrong PS. Forgot to mention. This software is installed on Windows 7 Professional, with UAC disabled  because it is not compatible with UAC p

Negative 73524 pAnother day, another problem with VS2012 and unit tests Our solution has three test projects, together containing 335 different unit tests. All of these tests successfully run locally on different machines, but when checked in to our TFS 2012 build server, each time only 235 tests are being discovered.p  pThere are 15 different test classes containing the unit tests, some of them using the new codeFakescode framework, others codeMOQcode, some none or both. All of the classes reside in test projects assemblies ending in strongTeststrong, the classes themselves are all ending in strongTeststrong.p  pSome classes are not being discovered at all during the test run as part of the build process, in other classes e.g. 8 out of 12 tests are discovered and run.p  pTaking the 8 out of 12 example, the [ProjectNameTest].dll thats being generated shows all 12 tests using code.NET Reflector 7.0code, its just so that some of the tests arent run. I also cannot find any similarities e.g. tests using codeFakescode  codeMOQcode  ... among the tests not run  discovered.p  pThe build settings being used define the codeTest Sources Speccode as code.dllcode it used to be codetest.dllcode, but I changed this just to make sure that all files are taken into account.p  pFor the codeRun Settingscode I initially started of with no codeRun Settings Filecode and codeCodeCoverageEnabledcode. As part of trying to solve the problems I also changed this to a user defined codeUnitTest.runsettingscode file, unfortunately with the same result.p  pDoes anybody know why there are all these problems What might be the reasons VS2010 and codeMolescode worked a lot better, VS2012 has been causing a lot of trouble recently.p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pMonths later we finally updated the TFS installation to Update 3, but this made things even worse. Unit tests on the build server dont run anymore at all. Enabling dumps and analysing them showed that a codeStackOverflowExceptioncode is thrown, but there is no indicator about the test that might be causing it. Again, locally on different developer systems the tests run without any problems. p  pWe are considering opening a call at Microsoft as weve spent far too much time getting the whole thing to work again. Moles were a whole lot better... I will keep this updated as soon as there is some kind of progress.p  pstrongUpdate 2strongp  pAnother few weeks have passed, and no real solution yet. As we have moved from VS2012 to VS2013 Premium each time now, we discovered that all tests are now run as part of the build process again. Unfortunately, we still have problems getting all tests to pass  locally, everything runs fine on multiple systems, on the build server about ten percent of test fail. Investigation to be continued...p

Negative 73524 pI am trying to learn how to use a service called quickblox for my iphone app backend. I have run into a problem when validating my apps connection with the quickblox service though. In order to authorize the connection I need to get a token from quickblox by sending a post request that contains my app id, authkey, timestamp, a nonce, and a signature. When I send the post request however, the server replies back with status code 422 that my signature is invalid. The signature is made by taking the app id, auth key, timestamp, and nonce and generating a hmacsha1 hash with it. I have verified that my hmacsha1 generator is working correctly, so I dont know if my post code is wrong or whether its something else, because it always comes back with signature error.

Negative 73524 pI was looking for some arguments why splitting up joins into single queries would be better  worse then running a single query with all joins at once. I am working in a PHP  MySQL environment.p  pAssuming all tables have their indexes configured properly, I am convinced multiple queries will be slower then a single query.p  pAnyway, as I am looking for pros and cons, I will list below what I have found and would be very interested in other people their feedback.p  pSingle queryp  p[pro] Mysql is able to optimize the queryp  p[pro] Less network trafficp  p[pro] Easier sorting and limiting results, using mysqlp  p[pro] MySQL can do what it is good atp  p[con] Big queriesp  pMultiple queriesp  p[pro] Smaller queriesp  p[con] Need to loop over huge resultsets when narrowing down the results PHPp  p[con] Pagination becomes a painp  p[con] More complex code needed in PHPp  pMy feeling says that single queries are betterfaster but maybe it depends on the situation as well. The tables are simple, we have some parentchild joins and some matching queries on cross tables as well. The biggest table is about 200k records.p  pAnother thought that brought me here was that MySQL joins are OK when it is about filtering records but when you have for example a product and a product type then the product type will be loaded with another mechanism that will cache all producttypes for example, this way you dont need to join on the product type as well.p

Negative 73524 pIf so can you provide explicit examples I understand that an algorithm like Quicksort can have On log n expected running time, but On2 in the worse case. I presume that if the same principle of expectedworst case applies to theta, then the above question could be false.

Negative 73524 pFirst I need to disclose that Im a major noob here...but I think Im getting better in no small part thanks to the help of the stack overflow community D  p  pIve created a dynamically generated menu for project milestones.  It uses a table that allows the user to enter the date and description of each milestone and save them to a database.  Each time the user wants to enter a new milestone, they click a button to dynamically generate a new row.  See picture for clarification a hrefhttpsdl.dropboxusercontent.comu11993667milestonesex.png relnofollowhttpsdl.dropboxusercontent.comu11993667milestonesex.pnga Note the checkboxes are only used to delete rows right nowp  pThat all works great so far.  The issue is that once the user saves their milestones, I want them to be able to revisit the page and modify their milestones or add more.  Obviously this requires the script to query the database and generatepopulate the rows accordingly.  p  pI cobbled together the following code to generate the form from the database but for some reason it crashes the page.  Ive checked the error log and noting relevant seems to turn up.  I was wondering if anyone might see a glaring error with what Ive got or be able to recommend an alternative method.

Negative 73524 pThis is a stupid small problem we had at work that a few of us have different solutions to, and were wondering if theres a better way to do it. Ill boil it down to something really simple for the sake of example.p  pSay we have a multidimensional array with the below values in it. Each value is its own element, and each row is an array.p  p0a00br 000bbr c000p  pIn the above array, array[0][1] would be a, array[1][3] would be b, and array[2][0] would be c. What we need to do, is increment all values adjacent to nonnumeric values by 1. So, the array after weve incremented the values should look like the below array. The current solution we have is to first check all 4 corners of the array, increment the adjacent values, then check the top and bottom rows, then check the first and last columns, and finally, check all other elements. Whenever we hit a nonnumeric element, we increment all other adjacent nonnumeric elements by 1. This is kind of lamecumbersome, and we know there has to be a better way. Its pretty much building a bombsweeper board in reverse, when you know where all of the bombs are.p  p1a21br 222bbr c111p

What runtimes do a native C application use This is not VC. Would his concern be just that the STL wont be exactly the same implementationp  pI dont see what the issue there would be.

Negative 73524 pI am learning android programming, and am having problems with up navigation in master  detail fragments.  For practice, I am putting together an application to track sheet music by composer for my wifes choirs library of sheet music.  Pretty esoteric, but if I can get it working, Ill have a better understanding of Android programming.p  pThe first screen is a listing of Composers.  Selecting one from the list displays details about the composer in the detail fragment this is working fineanddandy.p  pI have the detail fragment being created like this  Straight from the template provided by eclipsep  precodeIn ComposerListActivity.java public void onItemSelectedString id      if mTwoPane           In twopane mode, show the detail view in this activity by          adding or replacing the detail fragment using a          fragment transaction.

Pressing that button brings up another Master  Detail Activityp  precode    In ComposerDetailFragment.java     protected void viewPieces          Intent intent  new Intentthis.getActivity, PieceListActivity.class         intent.putExtraCOMPOSERID, this.dataObject.getId         this.getActivity.startActivityForResultintent, VIEWPIECESLIST      codepre  pThis works fine, and shows the list of pieces written by that composer.  You can select one of the pieces and it shows information about that piece title, number of parts, key, number of pages, etc.  If I press back from the pieces, it takes me back to the list of composers with the previouslyselected composer selected.  However, if I press up on the icon in the action bar, it takes me to an activity showing a blank detail fragment the id of the composer is lost.  I would expect in this case that back and up should function the same  they both should go up one level for the list of pieces to the list of composers.  On a phone, however, it should do what its doing except retaining the composer id, but that is a separate issue I suspect.  p  precodeIn PieceListActivity.java public boolean onOptionsItemSelectedMenuItem item      switch item.getItemId      case android.R.id.home          This ID represents the Home or Up button. In the case of this          activity, the Up button is shown. Use NavUtils to allow users          to navigate up one level in the application structure.

Negative 73524 pIm looking at a project that will benefit from an inmemory databaselike object. I will have perhaps one or two thousand objects with the same structure, all inheriting from an abstract class. There will be a couple of string fields, an int, perhaps an enum or two or maybe even a set of enums, and then a set of Strings. There would need to be a transient boolean field as well, but that likely wouldnt be a concern.p  pThese objects would be instantiated and constructed from preset data, although additional ones can be created beyond that if need be. They may be stored in an XML file or something similar. Id rather not hardwire the entire thing, of course, and using a local database like SQLite feels like overkill.p  pStoring these objects would be relatively simple if not for one thing I want the user to easily be able to find the object they want from ANY of the values, most of which would be unique. This rules out a HashMap unless I want to wrap a massive bunch of them, which is hardly ideal. That leaves me looking for a sort of indexed, inmemory databaselike object that supports retrieval via any field of the object. It may not have to store the objects directly, but could assemble them upon retrieval, or retrieve a row based on one field, get another field from the same row that serves as a sort of key, and then retrieve the object from a single HashMap based on that key.p  pIn short, the idea is to easily and quickly retrieve objects with the same fields based on any field they contain. Ive seen a variety of different libraries and such that may do this sort of thing, but theres a real myriad of these things out there. Whatever may work would need to be free and compatible with a variety of open licenses.p

When the page loads I keep the contents of the html body in a variable, and when I click the button I delete the contents of the html body and add the value of the variable in it.

Negative 73524 pSo I have a form with a submit button and a hidden field. The hidden field holds the value which will be used to query.

Negative 73524 pSo Im really new to iPhone development and this is what I want to achieve. I want a search bar that uses a REST api that Ive written to get back data and populate a table view.p  pIn terms of what Ive attempted  Im not sure where to start, so Ill just post some thoughts. p  pWhat Ive done is created three views  a root view, a search view and a results view. The root view should have a UISearchBarDelegate, an UITableView DataSource and an UITableViewDelegate because there needs to be a controller that can execute the search and populate the table. p  pHowever Im not sure if this is the right approach, or even where to go next after this. p  pI know I should probably try more code, but Im just really not sure where to start because this is an architecture thing  Im not sure where the data will be passed between search and resultsI think this should be in the root view and how that root view will know when the search is done.p  pThanksp

Negative 73524 pI have a treelike structure that needs to be serialized. Typical structure, with each node having codeparentcode members and codechildrencode vectors. codeparentcode is a raw pointertoclass, and codechildrencode are codevectorcodes of codesharedptrcodes. Now it seems that serialization works fine, but emdeemserialization leaves the codeparentcode members uninitialized pointers to code0xcccccccccode or code0x00000000code. p  pThe codeparentcode members are being loaded when the actual parent object has not yet finished deserializing, i.e. the childs codeparentcode member is loaded through the deserialization request of the parents codechildrencode.

Negative 73524 pWhat I want to be able to do is write many lines of code just once and copy and paste it into multiple methods. p  ol liI could just simply copy and paste but that would double the number of lines of code, making it harder to read. li lipI could create a method that contains those many lines of code and then call that method whenever I need those lines however, this means I would not be able to use the local variables I declared.p  precodeA methodAObject object      doC      I cannot do additional things with the local variables declared in C   B methodBObject object      doC   doC       Delcare and use a bunch of local variables  codepreli ol  pMy specific problem is that I need to access a local variable from a method that it calls.

However, I would now like to create a methodB that would simply return that URI, as I dont need it wrapped up in a custom object. I thought it was rather extraneous to create a new class when I only needed three lines of code deleted from the original methodA to make it work. In essence, I was looking for some kind of code template like functionality, but at compiletime, so that I could just type xyz for the a lot of lines around 20 that I wanted to substitute it with.

Negative 73524 pi have bunch of dependency models, so i am trying to load it when required considering the performance impact. So for that loading an model inside model requires getinstance method.

Negative 73524 pIve done my due diligence, but I dont think any of the questions so far have touched on this problem.p  pI have a situation where my PHP code generates class definitions based on config properties.p  pThe class definitions are basically data holders and can have eitherp  ul lipublic properties li lior protected properties with a public interface that supplies gettersetters. li ul  pIn certain config cases, the generated CLASS NAMES WILL BE THE SAME but their FILE NAMES WILL BE DIFFERENT. In a real environment, the user just generates a single set of class definitions based on the config they require and uses the classes in their app. No problems there, even if the user generates multiple sets of class definitions. PHP will happily churn along, providing only one set of definitions is referenced in the app.p  pI have two PHPUnit test cases where I do basically the same tests using the classes with the different definitions generated by either config. I use requireonce in all my code and do the same in unit tests, requireonceing only the class files that I need for that test.p  pPHPUnit is configured to run all tests that it finds under my test directory and was running as normal. When  I added tests for the different class generation, PHPUnit stopped working with a PHP Fatal error  Cannot redeclare class.p  pNow, the default behaviour of PHPUnit seems to be to load ALL the classes that ALL the tests need to run in one go. This causes the fatal PHP error even before any test are run because PHPUnit picks up a second definition for the generated classes they have the same class name but different file names even though I have only requireonceed the correct class definitions in each test file.p  pI can still run tests, but only with a single test file at a time, so currently I have to run all my tests either manually or by a batch file. A full code coverage report across all tests is not possible.p  pThe behaviour I would like is for PHPUnit to only load the classes that have been requireonceed per test file, not for all the test files it sees as being run from the phpunit.xml config. Or a better way would be for PHPUnit to only load its own classes for all tests specified and leave PHP itself to do the users requireonceing for each test.p  pIs there any way to get around this I have looked at PHPUnit config settings but none seem to fit the particular problem. I am not really familiar with PHPUnit under the covers so building another testsuite loader would be difficult.p  pIts probably best to do a simple example. Here are a couple of PHPUnit test files foo1Test.php and foo2test.php. The only difference between them is they requireonce a different class file which has a definition of the Foo class. It doesnt matter that all these classes are empty, they are all perfectly legitimate and it demonstrates the problem well. I just put all these files in a testfoo directory and ran PHPunit on them. You can do it too and you will get the same result.p  pfoo1Test.phpp  precodeltphp  requireonce dirname  FILE .Foo1.php  class Foo1TestCase extends PHPUnitFrameworkTestCase    gt codepre  pfoo2Test.phpp  precodeltphp  requireonce dirname  FILE .Foo2.php  class Foo2TestCase extends PHPUnitFrameworkTestCase    gt codepre  pFoo1.phpp  precodeltphp  class Foo    gt codepre  pFoo2.phpp  precodeltphp  class Foo    gt codepre  pThe two test files foo1Test.php and foo2Test.php are perfectly valid files and run through the following PHPunit command linesp  precodephpunit foo1Test.php phpunit foo2Test.php codepre  pAs you would expect, PHPUnit fails complaining about no tests which is fine.p  pI also have a standard phpunit.xml config file which will run all tests under the current directory.p  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingUTF8gt ltphpunit backupStaticAttributesfalse          cacheTokensfalse          colorsfalse          convertErrorsToExceptionstrue          convertNoticesToExceptionstrue          convertWarningsToExceptionstrue          forceCoversAnnotationfalse          mapTestClassNameToCoveredClassNamefalse          printerClassPHPUnitTextUIResultPrinter          processIsolationfalse          stopOnErrorfalse          stopOnFailurefalse          stopOnIncompletefalse          stopOnSkippedfalse          testSuiteLoaderClassPHPUnitRunnerStandardTestSuiteLoader          strictfalse          verbosetruegt     lttestsuite namefooTestsgt         ltdirectorygt.ltdirectorygt     lttestsuitegt ltphpunitgt codepre  pI ran PHPUnit with this config as followsp  pphpunitp  pThe output isp  precodePHP Fatal error  Cannot redeclare class Foo in varwwwtestfooFoo2.php on line 4 PHP Stack trace PHP   1. main usrbinphpunit0 PHP   2.

Although the test files are perfectly valid in isolation, PHPUnit wont run the tests under a testsuite because it has tried to load all the classes it needs for the whole testsuite BEFORE it runs any tests.p  pTo my way of thinking PHPUnit is doing the wrong thing here by picking up dependencies that it shouldnt for a particular test.p

Negative 73524 pIm designing a component API. The domain is mostly asynchronous in nature calling a web service, so it makes sense to design the API as asynchronousp  precodetypedef void HSKBooleanResultBlockBOOL succeeded, NSError error  void addConsent HSKSessionConsent consent completion HSKBooleanResultBlock completion codepre  pThe problem is that the asynchronous API makes it quite inconvenient to do some things. For example all tests have to use semaphores in order to wait for the component to finish. And if I want to chain several calls to the component, I have to nest the callsp  precode[service addConsent completionBOOL succeeded, NSError error      if succeeded          [service addConsent completionBOOL succeeded, NSError error                        ]      ] codepre  pNow even something as trivial as adding several items from a container is painful, even in a situation when I would be perfectly fine with a blocking call. Some APIs dodge this issue by offering both synchronous and asynchronous API. For example Parsep  precode[query findObjectsInBackgroundWithBlockNSArray objects, NSError error ] NSArray results  [query findObjectsamperror] codepre  pThis is quite easy to do, but it feels a bit like writing boilerplate code.p  pAnd then there are other solutions like a hrefhttpsgithub.comReactiveCocoaReactiveCocoa relnofollowReactive Cocoaa or a hrefhttpsgithub.comBoltsFrameworkBoltsiOS relnofollowBoltsa that make it easier to chain async calls, but are too much magic to be worth it for me. I could also only offer synchronous calls and let the caller dispatch the call on a background queue, but that feels like bad API design.p  pAre the other choices or even best practicesp

Negative 73524 pQuick question about Android application initialisation. Very often the initialisation tasks are placed inside main activity onCreateonResume methods.p  pNow the problem is, I cannot be guaranteed that the main activity code is always run.p  pFor instance I have MainActivity with a button that triggers AnotherActivity by using intentsp  pcodethis.startActivitynew Intentthis, AnotherActivity.classcodep  pNow imagine the user has tapped the button and the application is put into background when the users navigates forward to another application or something.p  pAfter a while, because of OS resource policy, the application process could be killed.p  pWhen I go back to the application, the process is restarted but only AnotherActivity is instantiated and run. So the initialisation code is skipped.p  pI thought that Application.onCreate could be a good choice but it should not contain to much time consuming code.p  pI was handed over some project which main activity is SplashActivity, that initialises some core application components and sometimes, after the process is restarted, the application breaks due to this behaviour.p  pThis is what happensp  precode0521 231430.992 DTESTAPP 22340 onCreate 0521 231431.002 DTESTMAIN22340 onCreatenull 0521 231431.032 DTESTMAIN22340 onStart 0521 231431.032 DTESTMAIN22340 onResume 0521 231436.922 DTESTMAIN22340 onPause 0521 231436.932 DTESTOTHER22340 onCreatenull 0521 231436.932 DTESTOTHER22340 Message Hello World 0521 231436.952 DTESTOTHER22340 onStart 0521 231436.952 DTESTOTHER22340 onResume 0521 231437.342 DTESTMAIN22340 onSaveInstanceState 0521 231458.312 DTESTOTHER22340 onPause 0521 231458.812 DTESTOTHER22340 onSaveInstanceState 0521 231947.342 DTESTAPP 24928 onCreate 0521 231947.342 DTESTOTHER24928 onCreatenot null 0521 231947.342 DTESTOTHER24928 Message null 0521 231947.392 DTESTOTHER24928 onStart 0521 231947.392 DTESTOTHER24928 onRestoreInstanceState 0521 231947.392 DTESTOTHER24928 onResume codepre  pTESTAPP is the log tag for Application.

Negative 73524 pIm using CocoaPods on an app where the workspace, consists of a main application project, and some static libraries as subprojects, each with their own dependencies. The static libraries are linked into the main project at compile time, and exist primarily as a means to encapsulate and organise code.p  pA problem arises where CocoaPods links the dependencies into the static libraries of the subprojects. If two or more of these static libraries have the same dependencies, they cannot both be linked into the main project, as doing so results in duplicate symbols. p  pThe workaround I have at the moment, is to create a dummy target in each of the subprojects, and set that as the link target in the pod file. The real target uses the xcconfig file generated by CocoaPods, without any of the dependencies being linked in.p  pWhile this does indeed work, and id the simplest solution I could find, it still carries the extra unnecessary burden of having a dummy target in each project, e.gp  precodexcodeproj MyAppMyApp.xcodeproj target MyApp do     xcodeproj MyAppMyApp.xcodeproj      pod MBProgressHUD,            0.9      linkwith PodDummy end codepre  pAnother disadvantage to this approach is that all the dependencies still need to be specified in the main project anyway, so that they are linked with the final executable.p  hr  pSo my question is How can I use CocoaPods in a static library project, without linking the dependencies into the binaryp  pOr better yet Could I specify the dependencies only in the static library subprojects, and have CocoaPods figure out what needs to be linked in the main project, resolving duplicates in the processp  pIm thinking of only including the main project in the pod file, and having the subprojects manually refer to the Pods directory for the headers.p  pThere seems to be have been some discussion around the issue in the past, but I cannot see what, if anything, came of it.

Negative 73524 pI have an MVC 5 application that gathers parameter information and invokes the SSRS Report Execution Service SOAP interface to generate the report and download it to the user as an Excel spreadsheet.p  pFor longerrunning reports, ideally, I would like to include an email address in the report execution call so that SSRS will accept the request, run the report asynchronously, and then deliver the result as an attachment to the email address included in the request.p  pMost information I found regarding email delivery revolves around Subscriptions.  However, I do not see any way to establish an OnDemand onetime Recurrence Pattern, or how to pass in an email address.p  pA coworker advised me to use Subscriptions and assign odd times, so that I can use the time to identify the GUID that SQL Server will assign the job.  Then, using the GUID, enable or disable the job as needed.  This is based on his general knowledge of SSRS, never having done this kind of thing himself.  The approach seems pretty kludgey.p  pI dont want to head down that road if there is a better way to accomplish the task.p  pCan someone point me toward a better approach and, perhaps, some resources for doing this through the SSRS SOAP servicesp
Negative 73524 pApple recently added support for indexeddb in both iOS8 Safari and Safari 7.1 on OSX. I am attempting to use this in a web application that stores about 65,000 records in indexeddb and queries them using some compound indexes.p  pIts working for me, but compared to Chromes implementation of indexeddb, its really, really slow. p  pTo be specific... a query that takes 2ms against Chromes indexeddb takes 500ms against Apples indexedbb. This particular query is using a compound indexeddb index 2 fields in the key using a IDBKeyRange.only value for the key to bring back about 100 documents of the 65,000 total.p  pMy application supports websql as the storage mechanism as well and when I switch to that in Safari, performance is great. My query returns in a few ms, just like Chrome. p  pAnyone else having trouble with the slowness of Apples indexeddb implementation Any suggestions as to how to make it work better or do we just have to wait for Apple to fix itp  pI believe that Apples indexeddb implementation is actually just a wrapper on top of websql and the fact that I can implement my app using websql directly with good performance would imply that such a wrapper, if implemented well, should perform fine. Sadly, that is not yet the casep

Negative 73524 pI am trying to write a function that takes in a 32bit floating point number that has been converted from a 32bit binary string and returns the previous representable float in 32bit binary.

Cant you just subtract the smallest representable value possible 000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0001 Also, what if any are the benefits of converting from IEEE 754 to Float before finding the closest representable binary valuep  pSo far I only have a function that converts a floating point number to simple precision 32bit binary. I would include my code, but this is for school so I feel iffy about putting it onlinegetting explicit corrections and advice.p

Negative 73524 pI have a datagrid in which I have defined different edit controls for editing data in one particular column. The visibility of each edit control is bound to the view model, to ensure only one of the edit controls is visible.  When the grid switches into edit mode say, the user selects cell and hits F2, when the edit control becomes displayed, I want it to have focus. However, it only works when I have one edit control. When I have more than 1, it doesnt work. I have determined that this is because the focus code is being executed for the last edit control as defined in the xaml irrespective of whether it is visible or not.p  pThere are multiple edit controls but for berevity Ill just limit the example here to two.p  pWithin the grid I defined the edit controls and bind the visibilityp  precodelttoolkitDoubleUpDown      ValueBinding TimeResult, ConverterStaticResource TickToDblSecondsConverter      VisibilityBinding ResultType, ConverterStaticResource IsTimeValueConvertergt  lttoolkitDoubleUpDown ValueBinding DistanceResult     VisibilityBinding ResultType, ConverterStaticResource IsDistanceValueConvertergt codepre  pThis works just fine and the correct control is visible and all the others are hidden.

I need a way to set the FocusedElement to the control that is visible. I thought maybe if it was implemented as a trigger, it would only get fired for the visible control. So I tried giving each control a name and moved the focus code to a DataTemplate.Triggerp  precodelttoolkitDoubleUpDown NametimeResultEdit      ValueBinding TimeResult, ConverterStaticResource TickToDblSecondsConverter      VisibilityBinding ResultType, ConverterStaticResource IsTimeValueConvertergt  lttoolkitDoubleUpDown NamedistanceResultEdit ValueBinding DistanceResult      VisibilityBinding ResultType, ConverterStaticResource IsDistanceValueConvertergt  ltDataTemplate.Triggersgt     ltTrigger SourceNametimeResultEdit PropertyVisibility ValueVisiblegt         ltSetter TargetNametimeResultEdit PropertyFocusManager.FocusedElement                  ValueBinding RelativeSourceRelativeSource Self gt     ltTriggergt     ltTrigger SourceNamedistanceResultEdit PropertyVisibility ValueVisiblegt         ltSetter TargetNamedistanceResultEdit PropertyFocusManager.FocusedElement                  ValueBinding RelativeSourceRelativeSource Self gt     ltTriggergt                                     ltDataTemplate.Triggersgt codepre  pBut this makes not the slightest bit of difference.  p  pSo, how do I change this so that I can have x number of edit controls, and focus will be set to that visible control when edit mode is invoked in the gridp

Negative 73524 pHi every one Im working on a project, I found myself in a need to get a number from a string in a specific index for example  Ive this id and I must get both numbers taking into account that a number can contain 1 or more digitals ex  1 or 12 p  pid  stockstockbundlefacturefounisseurligneffm1ligneff1idarticle p  pAs you can notice the id contains the number 1 in two different parts, so I need both numbers inside this string  I thought about using substring but if the first number contains more than one digits , I could miss the second numberp  pif someone has an idea,  thanks a lot in advancep
Negative 73524 pI have an AngularJS frontend that sends requests to a Rails API backend application. The AngularJS frontend is running in a NGINX server. The Rails API is running in an Unicorn server.p  pGenerally, they are working fine together, but in one case. When I first load the home page most of the times but not always there is a big delay around 12 seconds to process the request to Rails. Im not sure, but my guess is this is only happening for the first request from Nginx to Unicorn.p  pThis is a big issue for me, because when a user request the home page for first time, the page is loaded and displayed quite fast it takes around 2 secs to display all components, however, the user has to wait around these 12 seconds, until the combo boxes are loaded with data coming from the backend.p  pI have no idea about server configuration. Im just a developer. I tried to debug the request and try to figure out where the bottleneck is, but I dont find anything.p  pPlease, find my NGINX access.log logsp  precode127.0.0.1   [12Nov2014193345 0100] GET  HTTP1.1

Negative 73524 pThe code Im using to control my camera works by moving a vectorcamera.target and then setting the camera to look at that vector. In this case camera.lookAt camera.target . The onDocumentMouseMove function calculates a longitude and latitude and this helps to set the camera.target x, y, and z values. Below is an example of how things work. Pressing any key will cause the camera to rotate to an object but if you do that the next time you go to move the camera by dragging the mouse the camera will automatically jump to the last position before the keystroke. This is because in order for the mouse to move the camera it has to keep track of the lat and lon. So what Im having issues with is calculating the new lat lon position after the keystroke. I was thinking if the target x,y,z values can be calculated from the lon and lat than it would stand to reason that the lat and lon could be reverse calculated from the x,y,z, values. Unfortunately the math is beyond my means. I have added a bounty to this issue.

Negative 73524 pI am using log4j.xml file. I have two environments namely live amp test. The only difference in the log4j for the test and live are the levels INFOlive, DEBUGtest. So i have kept the common log4j.xml for both env and made the level as valueloglevel.  I have defined separate livelog4j.properties which contains codeloglevelINFOcode. likewise for test as well. My idea is, if i build the jar for live, the loglevel should be picked from the livelog4j.properties file. If for test build, then from testlog4j.properties. p  pHere my query is, am i doing the right thing will the log4j.xml will pick the values from the respective .properties file p  pI am using spring framework. I have referred lot of stuffs, but nothing is relevant to this.  I have added these properties files in the spring.xml not sure if it work I dont have client connectivity to test this app.p  pMy log4j version log4j 1.xp

Negative 73524 pSo, I inherited a game project with the following setupp  ul liA core SWF of the game itself, written in Haxe 3.0NME 4.0.2, utilizing the Starling framework, compiled to a Flash target using FlashDevelopli liAn AS3 wrapper which deals with assorted device communication needs e.g. detecting device capabilities, managing phone lock state and pausing gamemuting music, etc. This is compiled into own SWF AIR 3.6, which is what is actually launched, and subsequently loads the core SWF and adds it the stage.li liThis AS3 SWF is subsequently packaged into the target formats APKIPA using ADT also AIR 3.6, along with its assets including the core SWF.li ul  pDespite the odd complexity, the whole thing worked just fine we created functional, usable apps that aworked on both Android and iOS devices, and b passed submission criteria.p  pFlash forward several months the game has now passed beta and is ready for initial release. Android, everything goes fine. iOS, the other hand... Just days before we attempted to upload 1.0 to iTunes Connect, Apple changed their requirements. Suddenly, we were getting the error Apps and app updates submitted to the App Store must be built with the public GM versions of Xcode 5.1.1 or later, and iOS 7 SDK or later. Dont submit apps built with beta software. Fine, an error that tripped up many a developer back in September. Eventually Adobe released AIR 15, and packaged IPAs once again met Apples submission requirements.p  pUnfortunately, updating to AIR 15 upset the applecart. We were now able to upload the IPA, but, ironically, it would not work on iOS devices. The loading screen generated by the pure AS3 wrapper SWF comes up, but then when the title screen generated by the core SWF should be appearing, theres nothing. Black screen, no activity, or alternatively on some later attempts, instant, messageless app disappearance. No errors generated on the iOS console, nothing untoward happening when stepping through the app in FDB right up until the app evaporates and FDB loses its connection to the remote host. p  pOther salient informationp  pI have tried updating literally every component involved in the process, assorted updates of AIR 15, and 16 beta. All of the listed haxelibs. Weve even tried porting the core project in the most cursory of manners to OpenFL.  All of these have resulted in versions that work on Windows desktop, not phone, work on Android, but do not work on iOS.p  pHaxelib libraries  Originalp  precodeactuate 1.6.4 [1.6.5] air3 [0.0.1] haxelibclient [3.1.0rc.3] hxcpp [3.0.2] nme [4.0.2] openfl [1.0.6] openfltools [1.0.10] 1.0.8 starling [1.2.2] swf [1.0.2] codepre  pExtra tasty crashyp  precodeactuate 1.7.0 [1.7.5] air3 [0.0.1] haxelibclient 3.1.0rc.3 [3.1.0rc.4] hxcpp 3.0.2 [3.1.39] hxcs [3.1.1] lime [2.0.0alpha.4] nme [4.0.2] 5.1.8 openflcompatibility [1.0.1] openflhtml5 [1.4.2beta] openflnative [1.4.0] openfltools [1.0.10] openfl 1.1.1 2.0.1 [2.1.2] starling [1.2.2] swf 1.0.2 [1.5.2] codepre  ptldr Old version of AIR app works on iOS but cant be submitted to iTunes. New version can be submitted, but does not work on iOS resulting in either a frozen black screen or a crashp  pAny help whatsoever suggestions of what the problem might be, other ways we might be able to figure out the problem, or even ways to get the working app through the submission blockage e.g. resigning would be greatly appreciated. Having to rework the entire game in some other framework, etc, is an extremely untenable solution at this time. This is basically a life or death situation for a very promising indie game dev company.p

Perhaps it can achieved by manipulating some common visualization in an intricate wayp  pstrongEDITstrong Based on feedback from ee2Dev, I will do 4 lines instead of 2, capturing incoming and outgoing callstexts separately. Regarding granularity, it would be best if the visualization could capture one week of data in 5 minute intervals one text message will equal to 5 min of talking and a 48 minute call will be rounded up to a 50 minute call. That will amount to 72412  2016 possible intervals, which seems somewhat reasonable. Perhaps 10 min intervals would be more suitable than 5 min intervals, but I guess the code can be easily adjusted for that.

Negative 73524 pI am creating a web app in Flask and hosting on an AWSEC2 Ubuntu server. I created a webpage with a form that when submitted writes to a text file. However I am getting a 500 internal server error when the form is submitted. I believe that this is due to a permissions error and am not sure how to allow the file to be written to. The form is just on a webpage so there is no user attached to it. Therefore I think the permission would be classified under others. However, when I changed the permission of the file to allow others to write to it I still get the same error. Is there any way to fix thisp  pBTW the file is in the varwww directory if that helps.p

Negative 73524 pIm writing a site that allows users to explore data and each datums details.p  pIn particular, there is a page where the datum is loaded in the controller it requires scope information that is not available in the controller resolve section. This page displays the details resource once it resolves, and also allows the user to click to the next datum.p  pThe problem is when the user clicks to the next datum before the details resource on the current page returns. In this case, the next page loads as normal, and when the previous pages resource returns, Angular interprets this as the details for the new page and incorrectly loads it.

In order to remove the annotation one would press the carFound button. Then, after the carFound button is pressed following the first annotation placement, one should be able to press pinButtonPressed again, and the annotation should be placed wherever the user is, even if they have moved. The issue is the first time pinButtonPressed is pressed, the annotation does call the getLocation function, finds the current location, and sets this as the annotation coordinates and places the annotation, then I remove the annotation using carFound however, after that I move my current location and press the pinButtonPressed function again, and the annotation is placed where it was the original time, not where I had moved to. I have placed two print lines to print the coordinates the getLocation function is returning, and these coordinates are always the same as the first coordinates retrieved since the simulation began to run, no matter where I move my current location to and press the pinButtonPressed button. I believe I am overlooking something obvious, and was wondering if anyone had any ideas to help. Thank you.p

Negative 73524 pI am new to bison, and have the misfortune of needing to write a parser for a language that may have what would otherwise be an operator within a variable name.

I suppose I could manually parse the codeSTRINGcode in the parser action, but it seems like there should be a better way.  Perhaps flex could give back alternate token streams one for the codeBARBAZcode case and another for the codeBARBAZcode case that are diverted to different parser stacks for exploration  Is something like that possiblep

Negative 73524 pI would like to create a git repository and keep a backup copy of it in the cloud. Creating a remote repository would be a simple solution, but the code would be open to anyone with access to the cloud machine, thus compromised. Currently I manage this git repository in the local computer it is for only one user, them I compress the whole repository, them encrypt the tar ball, them I copy it to a cloud server. This solution is obviously cumbersome to manage, needs to have always the entire repository compressed, encrypted them uploadeddownloaded and it is virtually impossible to work in parallel although I havent done this yet. Could someone propose a better solutionp

Negative 73524 pNeed some tips on how I can get consumer loadbalancing right with RabbitMQ.p  pThe scenario is as below   I have 2 applications, lets say App1 amp App2 actually 2 stages of a single application, running on separate hosts may or may not be in the same AZ and rabbitMQ is used to handover halfdone tasks from App1 to App2.p  pThere are multiple instances of App1 and App2. Given the traffic volume, App1 is TCP loadbalanced. Id prefer App2 to be TCP loadbalanced  so that new instances of App2 are brought up when required, etc. etc.p  pNow, with my understanding of RabbitMQ, a loadbalancer cant obviously be used as a consumer. So I am thinking the setup could be as below  p  pIncoming Request  LB  App1  N1  RabbitMQ  workers  LB  App2  N2 p  pThe workers will just handoff the tasks to App2 instances via the LBp  pPS  I will be using Celery.

Negative 73524 pWe are trying to write an automated test for the behavior of the codeAppConfig.readycode function, which we are using as an initialization hook to run code when the Django app has loaded.

Negative 73524 pIm trying to do the following. I want to use libarchive to create a function which, when given a path, either opens the given file directly or is able to open an archive as part of the path and return the stream of a file inside it. So as an example, imagine you have a zip archive at codehomejoschfoobar.zipcode and inside that is a file at the path codeblubbla.txtcode. Then given the path codehomejoschfoobar.zipblubbla.txtcode I want to get a stream to read that file from within the archive. But if the given path is one to an actually existing file, then I want to get a stream to read that file.p  pSince the libarchive reader has to be kept in memory during the time of the reading I figured that I should wrap the whole thing into a class and store the things that must be kept alive as member variables.p  pMy codepathopener.hcodep  precodeinclude archivereader.hpp include archiveexception.hpp include ltboostfilesystemoperations.hppgt include ltboostfilesystemfstream.hppgt include ltsstreamgt include ltstringgt include ltmemorygt  class PathOpener      public         PathOpenerboostfilesystempath path         stdistreamamp getistream     private         boostfilesystempath path         bool isarchive         stdsharedptrltnsarchiveentrygt entry         stduniqueptrltnsarchivereadergt reader  codepre  pMy codepathopener.cccodep  precodeinclude scaniopathopener.h  PathOpenerPathOpenerboostfilesystempath p      path  p     isarchive  false     if boostfilesystemexistspath         return      boostfilesystempath archivepath      go through all components     forauto part  path.begin part  path.end part          archivepath  part         if boostfilesystemisdirectoryarchivepath             continue          if the current component was not a directory, try to          open it as a file and try to find the remaining path          in it         boostfilesystempath remainder          strip off the part of the path that is the archive name         part         for  part  path.end part             remainder  part         try              boostfilesystemifstream fsarchivepath             reader  stdsharedptrltnsarchiveentrygtnew nsarchivereadermakereaderltnsarchivensreaderformatALL, nsarchivensreaderfilterALLgtfs, 10240             forauto e  reader                              if egtgetheadervaluepathname  remainder                      entry  e                     isarchive  true                     break                                           break          catch nsarchivearchiveexceptionamp e               silently ignore archive read errors                   if isarchive          throw PathDoesNotExistExceptionpath        stdistreamamp PathOpenergetistream      if isarchive          return entrygtgetstream      else          return stdifstreampath.string.cstr       codepre  pNow the above does not compile and I realize that there are several problems with the code.

In the end the input should be a path where one component of it can be an archive for example in zip format and then the rest would be a path within the archive. Alternatively, the path is to a real file. And the output should be an istream because in other parts of the code we are using member functions like codegetlinecode, codeeofcode or use codeltltcode to read from it. And that part of the code should not have to know whether its reading from an actual file or an archive.p  pWhat is the best approach to make this work with Cp
