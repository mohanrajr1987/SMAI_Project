Positive 19392 pI am encountering a problem where I am not able to map LDAP attributes to LR User attributes, which are not available in Control Panel for example comments.p  pFor example, if I map LDAP attribute department to LR User model attribute jobTitle, it strongworksstrongp  precodeldap.user.mappingsjobTitledepartment codepre  pNow if I want to read the same attribute to a field which is not configurable through CMS then it strongdoes not workstrong meaning that the value is never assignedp  precodeldap.user.mappingscommentsdepartment codepre  pI have also tried custom mappings which also strongdoes not workstrong.  Created a custom attribute by the name userDepartment to User object. And the corresponding mapping in portalext.propertiesp  precodeldap.user.custom.mappingsuserDepartmentdepartment codepre  pSo in a nutshell  I am able to map any field coming from LDAP to LR User attributes which are shown in Control Panel screenname, firstname, lastname, password, jobtitle, mail etc but not to other LR User attributes comments, custom attributes.p  pSidenote The problem is not related to portalext.properties not being read updated. In every test scenario the previous LDAP settings have been deleted so they would be read from portalext.properties again. The fact that properties are correct has been verified from portalpreferences table.p  pstrongLiferay version 6.2.10 EEstrongp

Positive 19392 pI have two liferay portlets that work with OrientDB. First portlet constructs graphGraphBuilder, second visualizes itGraphVisualizer. I have also one application working with the OrientDB databaseOrientDBPersistence that both portlets use via spring beans. So it should work together in the following way. I create graph in GraphBuilder portlet and save it with custom label using OrientDBPersistence. Then I draw it using GraphVisualizer that asks OrientDBPersistence for graph with this particular label. p  pMy problem is that once I create graph1 and save it, I am able to vizualize it, but when I create graph2 it cannot be retrieved by GraphVisualizer, because it is not present in DB. However when I look into the studio I can see it there. Like the graphs I make are not visible to the Visualizer until I restart the portal. p  pSo in GraphDBPersistence I connect to OrientDB and I get the OrientGraph object to which I persist all my graphs with different labelp  precodeOrientGraph resultGraph  factory.getTx     resultGraph.setThreadModeOrientBaseGraph.THREADMODE.ALWAYSAUTOSET     return resultGraph codepre  pThen I build a graph in GraphBuilder that has injeced beans from  OrientDBPersistence to perform saving with Label1.  Saving looks like thisp  precode private void performGraphSavingString label, OrientGraph graphO      try         forVertex vertex  graph.getVertices             constructVertexvertex, graphO, label                          forSocialVertex vertex  graph.getVertices             CollectionltEdgegt outEdges  graph.getOutEdgesvertex             forEdge socOutEdge  outEdges                 SocialVertex opposite  graph.getOppositevertex, socOutEdge                 constructEdgevertex, opposite, socOutEdge, graphO, label                               graphO.commit     catchException ex         System.err.printlnex         graphO.rollback       codepre  pI also call codegraphO.shutdowncode. After graph is stored.p  pFor example vertext retrieval looks like thisp  precodepublic SetltVertexgt getAllNodesFromGraphString graphLabel, OrientGraph graph      SetltVertexgt labelledGraph  new HashSetltgt     try         IterableltVertexgt configGraph  graph.getVerticesOfClassgraphLabel         forVertex v  configGraph             labelledGraph.addv               catchException ex         graph.rollback             return labelledGraph  codepre  pThe retrieval always throws codejava.lang.IllegalArgumentException java.lang.IllegalArgumentException Class 133 was not found in database schemacode, but I can see it in the studio.p  pNo matter if I create this resultGraph once and I keep inside the bean, or I create it every time I access the bean, it always consist only the first graph I saved. After restarting portal, former graphs are visualized, but newly created are not found by the GraphDBPersistence. p  pDoes anyone have any idea  Thanksp

Positive 19392 pI want to figure out how to make one thing in Liferay. I am using a lot of custom portlets and faced a problem. I want to have my custom portlet as a through element in my portal. For example custom searchbar in my portal header as a portlet. But the problem is that I need the same instance for it, because every time when I will surf new page, every time It will be a new instance. Im right I need something like singleton. How can I do it with liferay And, of course, how can I make portlet as a through elementp

Positive 19392 pI have been using Liferay for work for 2 weeks. I noticed that its a bit difficult to find good documentation and tutorials. Until now I created pages from the web portal. After I create them, I drag and drop portlets. I dont really like this approach, I would prefer to use a coding approach. Is there a way to create a website or page programmatically by defining a project as I do to create portletsp  pMoreover, I am using Liferay with WebLogic 10.3.6. I want to know where liferay puts pages I created via webportal on the file system. I suppose that a file, or something similar, is created when I declare a new site on the Liferay webportal. p  pThank you all,p  pMarcop

Negative 19392 pIm writing a unit test for a method that packs boolean values into a byte.  The various bit locations are determined by the value of an enum, which only has 5 values right now, but its conceivable though extremely unlikely that this number could go to 9.p  pId like a simple test along the lines ofp  pprivate byte mmyNum enum MyEnum ...p  passertsizeofmmyNum lt MyEnum.values.lengthp  pIm under the impression that theres not a sizeof function in Java.  Whats the most elegant workaroundp  pEDITp  pI dont think I was clear.  Im not concerned about normal runtime.  My issue is that I can write this code now with a byte that stores all the information, but as the Enum grows in an unrelated part of code, I could reach a point where my bitmasking code breaks.  Rather than having this in a deployed application, Id like to have a unit test that fails when the number of states in the enum exceeds the number of bits in the storage variable, so when a programmer adds that ninth enum, they can adjust the type of the variable to something with more than eight bits.p

Negative 19392 pDoes anyone know if theres a plugin for Visual Studio 2008 that makes it possible to open VS2005 solutions in a nondestructive wayp  pWhat Im thinking is that the converted project file is kept in memory rather than replacing the original on disk, and .Net framework 2.0 would be targeted by defaultp  pThe current behavior requires a complicated conversion process that destroys the original solution file and ends up with a project targeting the newer framework.  I want something that would allow developers still using 2005 to continue working on the project.p
Negative 19392 pIve got a page that creates a ticket in our help desk system.  It acts as a wizard with the following steps  p  h2Step 1  h2  pUser selects the customer from a dropdown list.  There is a jquery onchange event that fires and generates the list for step 2 and hides the step1 div and shows the step2 div.p  h2Step 2h2  pUser selects the location from a dropdown list.  This is generated based on the customer selected in step 1.  There is a jquery onchange event that fires and generates the list for step 3 and hides the step2 div and shows the step3 div.  p  h2Step 3h2  pUser selects the type from a dropdown list and enters text into 3 different text boxes.  If the user fails to enter text or enters invalid text my controller changes the model state to invalid and returns the view.p  pHow can I get all the dropdowns to repopulate again with the correct selection the user chose and get the page to redisplay on Step 3p  pMy first thought was to use ajax and when the user clicks the Create button, I could create the ticket from there and if successful send them to the ticket detail.  If unsuccessful, well just display an error message and im still on the page so no big deal.  Now that I write it out I think this is best.  Are there any major issues using ajax  It seems most sites use some type of javascript or ajax these days.p  pSecond thought is to not use ajax at all and submit all the pages to the server.p  pWhat do you suggestp

Negative 19392 pIm not a troll and my goal isnt to start a flame war neither do I mean to disrespect the authors of the Zend Framework there is a lot of fine work in it. But... I have a job to get done and Im having a hard time reconciling the popularity of ZF against the reality of building apps with it. I would really like to know from others why they use Zend Framework. p  pI am fairly new to the PHP world but Ive done a lot of programming in many languages. After reading many tutorials and building a couple of apps in it, some core Zend Framework facilities feel like alpha code to me. For me the following fundamental weaknesses, among others, would seem too overwhelming to consider deploying apps with it   but over and over again ZF is suggested as one of the, if not ithei leading framework.p  pFirst let me say I find the much of ZF to be workable. Routing works pretty much as it should, the Layout facility is serviceable though very different from templating systems such as JSPASP, as is the cache facility, etc. There seems to be a tendency in the community to stuff a lot of modeling e.g. validation and view logic e.g. thisheadScript  why should my controller have to care which js file my view requires into controllers but could be a matter of usage and not inecessarilyi the frameworks fault.p  pNow for a couple of really serious IMO weaknesses Ive experienced in my short time with it. I shudder to imagine the other areas I will discover in the future if I continue to build with it.p  pstrong1. Form Layoutstrongbr  Many people seem to be unhappy with the lack of control over form layout. How can you have a popular framework where constructing a simple form requires so much discussion a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1277849zendframeworkformsdecoratorsandvalidationshouldigobacktoplainhtmlQuestion 1a and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1368721zendformwithxthmlscriptswithoutusingdecoratorsquestion 2a.p  pstrong2. AuthenticationAuthorizationstrongbr  No one really seems to understand how to simply perform routine authenticationauthorization. People [including yours truly] struggle with implementing simple access control. Further, the approach seems to lean on serialization for persistence, rather than traditional database storage of users and permissions. a hrefhttpdevzone.zend.comnodeviewid1665A confusing examplea, a hrefhttpframework.zend.comwikipagesviewpage.actionpageId39025a proposal to enhance the facilitya, a hrefhttpdevzone.zend.comarticle3509Zend5FAclandMVCIntegrationPartIBasicUsea tutorial  part Ia, a hrefhttpdevzone.zend.comarticle3510and part IIa. This is too much work guysp  pAre my perceived weaknesses not real or somehow not a problem Why or why not Why did you choose Zend Framework or not Are there other areas that youve found to be so painful that you want to dump ZF for a different approach Thanks for your opinions.p

Negative 19392 pI have a set of RESTful web services.  These services are protected on a Glassfish server by OpenSSO.  When I attempt to call the RESTful services directly from a browser, OpenSSO intercepts the request, then forwards the request to the REST service once the users credentials are authenticated.  OpenSSO utilizes a session cookie on subsequent requests until the session is invalidated .  Im sure this piece is working correctly.p  pWed like to call these services from a Flex client.  In order to enable PUT and DELETE operations, we set up BlazeDS to proxy the RESTful requests from the flex client to the REST service.  When security to the RESTful services is disabled, this piece works great.p  pNow were trying to secure the entire application.  Weve placed the Flex SWF into a war and deploy to Glassfish.  Weve placed security around this resource and when a user attempts to download the SWF through an HTML link in the war, OpenSSO intercepts the request, then forwards to the application on successful authorization just like it does for the RESTful web services.p  pThe problem is  the RESTful calls made by the Flex application via BlazeDS are failing.  OpenSSO seems to be intercepting these requests as well and again asking for the users credentials.  It doesnt seem the authentication cookies are being passed to or maybe by the BlazeDS proxy.p  pHow can I can access the cookies returned by the original SSO authorization request and have BlazeDS pass them along to the RESTful web servicep

Negative 19392 pI already have a CI build running on my Tfs2010 instance, but Id like to get a Gated checkin build running as well. There are subtle differences between the ways I would like these two builds would run, however. Specifically, Id like the Gated checkin to not produce bug workitems on failure, not associate changesets and workitems on build, not move builds to the drop, and not maintain previous builds. Since builds initiated by Gated checkins are uncommitted changes, these steps seem unnecessary to me, but I would definitely like the CI build to perform these functions.p  pUnfortunately, theres this strongNOCIstrong thing that appears on my changesets after theyre committed by the Gated Checkin build, and the CI build is never triggered. I found a hrefhttpsocial.msdn.microsoft.comForumsenUStfsbuildthreadcff735c5403a48edbd5c5cbb26a0c089this threada that seemed to indicate that my DefaultTemplate.xaml should have a Get Activity NOCIOption parameter in there somewhere however nothing in the configuration file seems to indicate anything of the sort. Neither string is present, and I cant find any reference documentation in the msdn library.p  pIn fact, in the msdn library, theres a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms400688.aspxa pagea that seems to link to the page I want, however where the link would actually be theres a misplaced, duplicate link to Control where the build system places your binaries.

Negative 19392 pI have some float values I want to convert to a string, I want to keep the formatting the same when converting, i.e. 999.0000float  999.0000String.  My problem is when the values contain an arbitrary number of zeroes after the decimal point, as in the previous example, they are stripped away when converting to a string, so the result I actually end up with is 999.  p  pI looked at the format specifiers for the codetoStringcode method on a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarydwhawy9k.aspxRFormatStringMSDNa, the RoundTrip R specifier looks like it will produce what I want, but it is only supported for Single, Double and BigInt variables.  Is there a format specifier like this for float variables  Or would it be easier to just convert the values to doublesp  pUPDATE Just for clarity, the reason why I want to keep the trailing zeroes is because Im doing a comparison of decimal places, i.e. Im comparing the number of digits after the decimal place between two values.  So for example, 1.00 and 1.00000 have a different number of digits after the decimal point.  I know its a strange request, its for work and the requirement is coming from on high.p  pUPDATE 2311p  pI was thinking about this too hard, Im reading the numbers from a txt file and then parsing them as floats, Im going to modify the program to check whether the string values are decimals or whole numbers.  Sorry for wasting your time, although this was very insightful.p

Negative 19392 pIm beginning to work on the caching infrastructure for my ASP.NET MVC site. The problem is, I cant seem to find a reasonable place for data caching other than everywherep  pRight now my architecture looks like thisp  pController  Service Layer  Repository. The repository uses Linq to SQL for data access. p  pThe repository exposes generic methods like Insert, GetById, and GetQueryable, which returns an IQueryable that the service layer can further refine. p  pI like the idea of putting caching in the repository layer, since the service layer shouldnt really care where the data comes from. The problem though is with cache invalidation. The service layer has more information about when data becomes stale than the repository. For instancep  pSuppose we have a Users table and an Orders table the canonical example. The service layer offers methods like GetOrderint id, which  would call the repository layerp  precodepublic Order GetOrderint id      usingvar repo  repoFactory.CreateltOrdergt              return repo.GetByIdid       codepre  porp  precoderepo.GetQueryableorder gt order.Id  id ampamp order.HasShipped  false.Single codepre  pIf we cache in the repository layer, it seems like it would be very limited in knowing when that order data has changed. Suppose the user was deleted, causing all their orders to be deleted with a CASCADE. The service layer could invalidate the Orders cache, since it knew the user was just removed. The repository though since its a Unit of Work, wouldnt be aware. Ignore the fact that we shouldnt be querying orders for a deleted user, since its just an example. p  pTheres other situations where I think this shows itself. Suppose we want to fetch all the users ordersp  precoderepo.GetQueryableorder gt order.UserId  userId.ToList codepre  pThe repository can cache the results of this query, but, if another order is added, this query is no longer valid. Only the service layer is aware of this though. p  pIts also possible my understanding of the repository layer is wrong. I sort of view it as a facade around the data source i.e. changing from L2SQL to EF to whatever, the service layer is unaware of the underlying source. p

I need to know if being in the background running or suspended makes a difference and in whatever case what methods are called and if the alert, badge andor sound is shownplayed.p  pThanks.p

Negative 19392 pI need some help.  I am trying to figure out how to schedule jobs in Quartz.Net.  Jobs in Quartz correspond to tasks in my Web Application, which are each apart of a Job in my Web Application.  I want users to be able to launch a Job WebApplication Context on demand and have it run immediately or schedule the job in the future and, to possibly repeat on a given interval.  I know how all these items are accomplished in Quartz individually, but i am having a hard time putting it all together.  p  pFor example, in my web application, I may have a job with several task, in a specific order. I want to be able to schedule these tasks in quartz so that they execute in the same order determined in my Web Application.  Does anybody have idea of how to do this I have read up on Quartz documentation saying to store the next Job in the JobDataMap, Just struggling with it.p  pI am currently waiting to create Quartz jobs until a user requests to either schedule the Job or Run it.  Do you think I should be creating the job and trigger on creation of the task in the Web App and then pulling that information from the task object for scheduling in Quartz  p

Negative 19392 pI have a database with a table for details of ponies, another for details of contacts owners and breeders, and then several other small tables for parameters colours, counties, area codes, etc.. To give me a list of existing pony profiles, with their various details given, i use the following queryp  precodeSELECT      FROM profiles         INNER JOIN prmbreedgender             ON profiles.ProfileGenderID  prmbreedgender.BreedGenderID         LEFT JOIN contacts             ON profiles.ProfileOwnerID  contacts.ContactID         INNER JOIN prmbreedcolour             ON profiles.ProfileAdultColourID  prmbreedcolour.BreedColourID     ORDER BY profiles.ProfileYearOfBirth ASC limit codepre  pIn the above sample, the profiles table is my primary table holding the Ponies info, contacts is second in importance holding as it does the owner and breeder info. The lesser parameter tables can be identified by their prm prefix. The above query works fine, but i want to do more.p  pThe first big issue is that I wish to GROUP the results by gender Stallions, Mares, Geldings... I used ltlt GROUP BY prmbreedgender.BreedGender  or ltlt GROUP BY ProfileBreedGenderID  before my ORDER BY line, but than only returns two results from all my available profiles. I have read up on this, and apparantly need to reorganise my query to accomodate GROUP within my primary SELECT clause. How to do this however, gets me verrrrrrry confused. Step by step help here would be fantabulous.p  pAs a further note on the above  You may have noticed the limit var at the end of my query. This is for pagination, a feature I want to keep. I shouldnt think thats an issue however.p  pMy secondary issue is more of an organisational one. You can see where I have pulled my Owner information from the contacts table herep  precode    LEFT JOIN contacts         ON profiles.ProfileOwnerID  contacts.ContactID codepre  pI could add another stipulationp  precode        AND profiles.ProfileBreederID  contacts.ContactID codepre  pwith the intention of being able to list a ponys Owner and Breeder, where info on either is available. Im not sure how to echo out this info though, as row[ContactName] could apply in either the capacity of owner OR breeder. p  pIs this a case of simply running two queries rather than one Assigning a variable foo to the first run of the query, then just run another separate query altogether and assign bar to those results Or is there a smarter way of doing it all in the one query e.g. row[ContactName]Firstiteration, row[ContactName]Seconditeration Advice here would be much appreciated.p  pAnd Thats it Ive tried to be as clear as possible, and do really appreciate any help or advice at all you can give. Thanks in advance.p  EDIT  pMy query currently stands as an amalgam of that provided by Cularis and Symcbeanp  precodeSELECT          FROM                 profiles             INNER JOIN prmbreedgender                 ON profiles.ProfileGenderID  prmbreedgender.BreedGenderID             LEFT JOIN contacts AS owners                 ON profiles.ProfileOwnerID  owners.ContactID             INNER JOIN prmbreedcolour                 ON profiles.ProfileAdultColourID  prmbreedcolour.BreedColourID                      LEFT JOIN contacts AS breeders             ON profiles.ProfileBreederID  breeders.ContactID         ORDER BY prmbreedgender.BreedGender ASC, profiles.ProfileYearOfBirth ASC limit codepre  pIt works insofar as the results are being arranged as I had hoped i.e. by age and gender. However, I cannot seem to get the alias to work in relation to the contacts queries breeder and owner. No error is displayed, and neither are any Owners or Breeders. Any further clarification on this would be hugely appreciated.p  pP.s. I dropped the alias given to the final LEFT JOIN by Symcbeans example, as I could not get the resulting ORDER BY statement to work for me  my own fault, Im certain. Nonetheless, it works now although this may be what is causing the issue with the contacts query.p

Negative 19392 pIm wondering whether a file gets loaded entirely when it contains conditional statements. p  pAssume Im having a big file with about 5000 lines of code just as an example, but half of the code wouldnt get executed because its in a conditional statement. Would it still take the same time to load the file p  pI assume not, so can I also assume that its generally faster to split code in multiple files and let an autoloader handle the needed files  Or would the new file request slow the whole thing down again  In this case Wheres the border when a file load is faster than the execution of a file with conditional statementsp

Negative 19392 pLet me preface this problem with the following strongemIve only tested this using the storage emulator.emstrong SDK 1.5.p  pUsing a quickly built console app and local storage emulator, I created a fail scenario to test how a blob lease behaves upon the application exiting ungracefully. In the Azure production version, it would be in the form of multiple web role instances accessing the single blob and locking it via leases. Ive had web role instances fail out, so I figured this would be a good test scenario.p  pThe app acquires the lease on a particular blob, hits a break point before the lease release and I manually kill the console app. When I rerun the console app and try to acquire a new lease, I get the conflict error 409. This behavior is even exhibited quite some time after the first lease acquisition and ungraceful exit.p  pI know, I know... I should just push it out to the cloud and see what happens, but I havent had the opportunity yet.p  pIs this behavior simply a case of the wacky storage emulator or will Azure behave the same wayp

Negative 19392 pIve written a server that accepts a socket connection on a secondary port for the purposes of streaming debugging information that normally goes to codestderrcode.  This second port an error serving port is only intended to have one connection at a time, which, is convenient, because it allows to me redirect codestderrcode using a codedup22code call.  See a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq873674032836Can I redirect a parent process39s stderr to a socket file descriptor on a forked processa.p  pThe following code is nearly satisfactory in every regard.  When a client logs into the port, the codestderrcode stream is directed to the socket.  When another client logs in, the stream is redirected again, and the first client stops receiving entirely satisfactory.p  pWhere it falls short in the design is when the client closes the connection, the server crashes because it is trying to codewritecode to a socket that is closed.p  pIve got a rudimentary signal handler for the normal child processes, but Im not sure how to handle the specific signal from the parent process when the error socket closes. p  pstrongHow can I trap the signal in the parent that the connection on the ERRPORTNUM has closed and have the signal handler reopen or codedupcode stderr back to codedevnullcode for the next awaiting error clientstrongp  pAlso, what should I do with an original error client connection when a second connects Currently the first client is left dangling.

Negative 19392 pI currently have only one tableView on the screen to display some data,p  pand when the data is updated, I use a simple UIAnimation to update the tableView, that isp  pAlloc a new tableView with updated data out of the screen first,p  pthen move the strongoldstrongor current tableView out of the screen and release it when the animation is done,p  pat the same time, move the strongnewstrong tableView to the place where the old one was, and with the same direction and velocity of the old one.p  pSo at any moment of this animation, there are TWO tableViews moving towards the same direction on the screen, and the only difference is the old one is moving out, and the new one is moving in.p  pI believe you can image how it goes.p  pbut question is, when I slow down this animaiton, for instance, make the animationDuration 1.0s,p  pand I found that during animaion, theres a third tableView, whose data and appearance is totally the same as the one tableView, sticking on the screen with no motion at all, till the new tableView covert it completely,p  pHow I wish I can make it a GIF and display here.p  pIt is just like the ghost of the old tableView very weird to me, such a greenhand of IOS.p  pand here is my code to make the animation.p  pHoping someone to help me out of the ghost Thanks a lotp  precode  .h property nonatomic, assign UITableView recordsTable  .m  voidnewTablewithHorizonNSInteger horizon AndVerticalNSInteger vertical   add Table View UITableView newTable  [[UITableView alloc] initWithFrame                          CGRectMakekTableX  320horizon, kTableY  480vertical, kTableW, kTableH                                                      styleUITableViewStylePlain] newTable.delegate  self newTable.dataSource  self [self.view addSubviewnewTable] UITableView formerTable  self.recordsTable self.recordsTable  newTable UIViewAnimationOptions options  UIViewAnimationOptionCurveEaseInOut [UIView animateWithDuration1.0                       delay0                     optionsoptions                  animations                      CGPoint formerCenter  formerTable.center                      [formerTable setCenterCGPointMakeformerCenter.x  320horizon, formerCenter.y  480vertical]                      CGPoint newCenter  self.recordsTable.center                      [self.recordsTable setCenterCGPointMakenewCenter.x  320horizon, newCenter.y  480vertical]                   completionBOOL done                       if done                         [formerTable release]                  ] codepre  pp
Negative 19392 pIn Java, I am trying to iterate over a map to complete the implementation of the codeputAllcode method from the codeMapcode interface. However, I cant use codekeysetcode, codeentrysetcode nor codevaluescode to do this which means that I cant call an iterator for this purpose. p  pI am stumped as to how to go about it without an iterator.p  pstrongEditstrongp  pJust to clarify, my job is to implement all of the Map methods without using these three.

Negative 19392 pGoogle Wallet InApp Payments, a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.cominapppaymentshttpsdevelopers.google.cominapppaymentsa, developer documentation and tools are at the present best broken, incomplete, andor lacking relevant information. I feel I must write this in the hope that they take note and perhaps hear our concerns and improve upon this. Also because there isnt much developer information out there right now about this new payment system, I hope this will generate positive activity.p  pThe support documentation points to a very quiet forum at a hrefhttpsgroups.google.comgroupinapppaymentstopicshttpsgroups.google.comgroupinapppaymentstopicsa.  Ideally, it could just point here where things are alive p  pServer side examples are documented only in part, directions suggest to use one of around five or six different libraries, but directions completely end there.p  pOne library link leads to a GitHub stored library written in Python which, apparently, you must somehow rewrite one of the main files in order to use.  Again this emhas not been documentedem by the Google Wallet team anywhere in the documentation. Its also very bizarre that they would choose to only write a small bit of a PHP tutorial, which, by the way, is a very popular, familiar, and ultrahighlyleveraged language.  Instead, they wrote a main example in Python when the first example on the page, a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.cominapppaymentsdocstutorialhttpsdevelopers.google.cominapppaymentsdocstutoriala, is written in Ruby...p  pThe other surprising lack of quality about the docs is the page where they list the various error codes that emone mayem come across while debugging. Its truly amazing that its missing.p  pThe errors may look something like this     Uh oh. There was a problem.      We couldnt complete your purchase because of a technical issue.      Details of the problem below      Unfortunately, we could not confirm your purchase with the merchants      server. Your order has been canceled.

Negative 19392 pBasically Im trying to get a rankings between 4 people. I have an array of player scores which contains the scores of each person such that person 1s score is at index 0, person 2s score is at index 1, etc... I want to obtain the index of the top scorer in the list and get the second, and the third, and the last.p  pMy attempt at the solution I made a list out of the array playerScores I feel like it might not be necessary, but due to what Im about to do, I didnt want to ruin the original scores which contains the scores in order. And then, I find the max number in the list and get its index. Then I change the value to a negative value at that index. And then I redo the steps.p  precodeListltintgt listOfScores  new ListltintgtplayerScores.ToList  We get the max value to determine the top scorer of the game  and then we insert a negative value at that same spot of the list so we can  continue on figuring out the following max value in the list, etc. rank1  listOfScores.IndexOflistOfScores.Max listOfScores[rank1]  1  rank2  listOfScores.IndexOflistOfScores.Max listOfScores[rank2]  1  rank3  listOfScores.IndexOflistOfScores.Max listOfScores[rank3]  1  rank4  listOfScores.IndexOflistOfScores.Max listOfScores[rank4]  1 codepre  pI feel like I can do this in a much more efficient manner and as less messy as this code... Well, this is also assuming that negative is not a score a person can get. Is there any other way, to be more efficient than this And what about if say we want to have negative scoresp

In the desktop side I am using Delphi 7 and Indy 9.0.50.p  pWhen I try to get updated data and there is nothing new in the server side, my server API returns code 304 not modified wich I understand as being the most apropriate code in this case. But the indy component TidHTTPClient raises a Timeout Exception specificaly EIdReadTimeout. And it actually waits for a few seconds, causing a delay I am not comfortable with.p  pIs this behaviour ok Am I using an unapropriate HTTP code Is there a way to avoid the component from waiting for data once it will never come for surep
Negative 19392 pI am trying to use multiple emulators for the same project and running into difficulty. I am a total beginner to Android. Is it possible to use an avd emulator for part of a project i.e. multiple activites and to then switch to a google maps emulator to show a map bases on some user input Im aware that I could just use the google maps emulator and design using map overlays but is there a way to use two emulators at oncep
Negative 19392 pim working on this problem for quite a time, and cant get it to work. Hope some of you could spare the time to help me.p  pstrongThe scenariostrong br  There is a web application which uses spring mvc. This web app ist supposed to use another maven project, where a persistence layer is contained. The persistence layer currently only consists of a service and a springdata repository. The persistence layer itself handles the work with a local mysql instances.p  pstrongMy Problemstrong br  So far for the understanding of the scenario. I have a JUnit test inside the maven project that contains the persistence layer. The Test loads and save an object of an entityclass. This is handled over the Service. Both operations work fine.p  pNow im trying the same thing inside the web app. Again im trying to save and load an entity object. Again in a JUnit Test. But this time it fails. Spring states that the Repository reference inside the Service couldnt be autowired, cause there is no bean that would fit for that.p  pI tryed multiple things to get this solved, like using a direct wiring, giving qualifiers and so one. No of my actions worked. I even build two complete new maven projects where i simplified the scenario a bit, but left the nessarcy things the same. There it worked like a charm. I dont get it what im doing wrong on this one since i adapted the settings from the working example.p  pbr strongFiles from the persistence projectstrong br br  empersistence.xmlemp  precode ltxml

Negative 19392 pI have a large amount of data to process with math intensive operations on each data set. Much of it is analogous to image processing.

Negative 19392 pI have a handler in an Eclipse plugin developed on Indigo that I want to run every time a Java file in a text editor is saved or opened, ideally.

Negative 19392 pI have a Tomcat server running some Jersey RESTful services and Im using Apache to host the static content.  The static content for the most part is empty, and the content is filled out via RESTful calls, but aside from the login page, I dont want anyone to be able to browse to the other static pages directly.  We have an authentication servlet that filters any requests to the REST services, but I was wondering what the best approach would be to handle the static content.  Id rather not be serving static content via Tomcat if at all possible.p  pEdit I should mention that only the login page should be directly accessible with no need to be filtered, etc.p

Negative 19392 pWhat is the best way to deal with multiple client side templatesp  pI noticed that if I keep them in my mother html file, it soon gets bloated with stuff, so I thought that maybe it would be better if I just put them in separate js files and load them one by one. p  pAnother idea of mine was to avoid putting them separately as templates, but rather write them as strings and sort of couple them with the backbone.js views which are going to use them. I know that this would bring a lot of negative from designers, web developers, and software engineers in general, but for the projects I am working on, this seems like a very speedy way to develop because I have logic and layout at the same place. Plus, by reverse engineering, I proved that a bunch of prominent web services are doing the same so ... p

Negative 19392 pSome background I have a normal table, and an archive table. The archive table contains a record of every row the normal table has ever had, so we can trace row updates and deletes.

I then need to convert these values back after they are sent and received. I am not sure how to go about doing this.p

Negative 19392 pI currently have a large number of projects with a complex dependency structure being developed by 50 developers using Maven 23 with Nexus and Jenkins. We develop at a fast pace and more often that not we build and deploy releases with SNAPSHOT dependencies. Most of the time we cannot wait for one team or another to build a release version before we have to deploy. Due to this we have had a number of issues with bugs and worksinprocess entering production and having no idea what changes are in those SNAPSHOTS. p  pWhat I am looking to do is to eliminate SNAPSHOTS and move to automatic releases with the versionsmavenplugin and to implement a release Staging policy. p  pAnd here in lays the problem. For developers and for the CI build it needs to be configured to resolve dependencies from Staging and Release and publish ONLY to Staging. We then want to be able to Promote that build as a release, rebuilding it to resolve dependencies from Release and publish to Release initially this will be a manual promotion but we may wish to automate this also. Does this all sound reasonablep  pI do not want to use the mavenreleaseplugin because we have tried to use this before and we dont like the fact that it modifies the pom automatically and makes changes in our scm, triggering more builds.p  pAlso, is there even a way to tell maven to use one repository for resolving and another to publish to Could I do this with gradlep  pAny commentsideas on this would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 19392 pIm currently working on a program to summarize text. Im having an issue where, if something is formatted when you put it in, its formatted the same way in the output. For example, if you putp  precodeThis is a test. New line here. This isnt a new line. codepre  pthen you will getp  precodeThis is a test. New line here. This isnt a new line. codepre  pwhile I want the program to outputp  precodeThis is a test. New line here.

While I dont wish to post the code for my algorithm, the basics of what it does is that it goes through and separates sentences by punctuation, performs tests on them, puts the good ones back together, and then outputs it to an NSTextView. Is there any way to remove all formatting from the string or the output in the NSTextViewp
Negative 19392 pIm having problems with Visual Studio 2012, trying to add an MVC4 Controller with scaffolding. Ideally I would like to have an Entity Framework model edmx file, etc generated from a database using Add New Item  ADO.NET Entity Data Model i.e. not Code First in a separate assembly from my web application. However, when I set this up and use Add Controller, specifying MVC controller with readwrite actions and views, using Entity Framework and choosing a Model class and Data context class from my DatabaseModel assembly the following alert message pops up.p  blockquote   pIfl.Payforit4.DatabaseModel.Mno is not part of the specified   Ifl.Payforit4.DatabaseModel.Payforit4Entities class, and the   Ifl.Payforit4.DatabaseModel.Payforit4Entities class could not be   modified to add a DbSet property to   it. For example, the Ifl.Payforit4.DatabaseModel.Payforit4Entities   class might be in a compiled assembly.p blockquote  pNot being able to modify the class makes sense since it is in another assembly, although in the same solution, and autogenerated via T4 but looking at the autogenerated code for Payforit4Entities the DbSet property is quite clearly there already.p  blockquote precode    public DbSetltMnogt Mnoes  get set  codepre blockquote  pIve tried a number of other things.p  ol liputting the data model directly in the web applicationli lichanging the model class to a variety of other tables in the database in case there is a problem with the Mno classli lireducing the data model to just a single, simple tableli liusing the Entity Framework Power Tools Beta 2 to reverse engineer a Code First model. This generated a new set of errors. I can see why it is a beta.li lichanging the ADO.NET Data Model Code Generation Strategy from None to Default to create a data model based on ObjectContext rather than DbContextli liTurning off pluralisation so the property name is Mno instead of Mnoesli ol  pNone of them worked. The only thing that did work was writing a Code First DbContextderived class and POCO by hand. Coincidentally every example Ive found that demonstrates MVC4 scaffolding uses this sort of data model. Is there something somewhere that says Code First is the only sort of data model that works with MVC4 scaffolding Has anyone managed to scaffold a database first .edmx data model in Visual Studio 2012 The database is complex enough that Id rather stick with a database first strategy.p  pI can see that there would have to be some differences in the scaffolding of Code First versus Database First models. For example, the former has the POCO property holding the key indicated by a KeyAttribute whereas the latter holds that information in the edmx model files. Is this the rationale for the reverse engineer feature in Entity Framework Power Tools Are we expected to move away from edmx files to reverse engineered Code First models in order to use MVC4 scaffolding If so, are we expected to carry on using Dynamic Data projects until the Entity Framework Power Tools are finishedp

Yet whilst security to access the data centre can often be impressive, individual rack level security is often inadequate. Given the number of inhouse staff and external engineers, from cablers to storage and server providers, traipsing through a data centre on a near daily basis, poor rack level security is a potential risk.ltpgt ltpgtAccording to a recent survey conducted by Lieberman Software, 42 percent of IT staff can get unauthorised access to their organisations most sensitive information  including the CEOs private documents. The failing is blamed on managements naivety when it comes to understanding just how much privileged access their IT departments actually have.ltpgt ltpgtThe fact that most racks are secured only with standard handles using a manual key, bears out this survey. Easily broken or bypassed, these locks provide minimal corporate protection they offer no access control or audit trail of activity. Given the huge ongoing investment in data centres  during 20112012, the UK invested an estimated 3.35 billion in data centres the second highest spending of any country, according to the Datacentre Dynamics Global Industry Census 2011  extending standard access control techniques to the data centre racks is an important step.ltpgt ltpgtCompanies can opt for a rack specific key, combination locks or key cards that are IP enabled to allow an organisation to impose strict control over the timeday an individual is allowed to access the rack. Using standard access control software, all activity is recorded and audited, providing the organisation with a complete list of those who have accessed the racks.ltpgt ltpgtFor organisations, this approach adds control and addresses one important aspect of the internal threat. For colocation sites, rack level security removes the need to cage off client specific rack space areas freeing up space that can be used for more racks, delivering a return on investment, as well as improved client security.ltpgt ltdivgt codepre  pThe page can be found a hrefhttp2bm.co.ukbloghowsecureareyourracks relnofollowherea.p  pI need a method to get the html in that div just from the page url, keep the styling and put it into a string and then populate a uiwebview, can anyone help me pleasep  pThanks.p  pbetter code scenariop  pBasically I populate a uitable view from an rss feed of blog posts.

Negative 19392 pHTTP Cache. p  pAm I right if I say that HTTP Cache is for send or not send a contentbody, not headers   to the clients It helps to reduce the count of transferred data between server and clients, but not the load on the server. HTTP Cache doesnt even need to do this. This is not its problem. So HTTP Cache doesnt care about the serverside. p  pHence the question. What the best way to reduce the load on the server. Simplify the thought  why should we generate a content for response if we are not going to send this content to the client. Why should we execute the heavy queries to the DB if gotten data wont be sent to client. Yes, we have to find out whether data for request was modified or not. Maybe somehow we could store this information But if we are talking about highly dynamic data. For example, we have to cache the request which retrieve a bunch of photos and we could put the filters by distance  around 1000m, by time  within 1h, by category, ...  and sorting params by distance  the nearest to a client, by time, ... on the photos. And the same photo could land to the different responses with different params.p

Ive read about SimpleMembership, roles and everything all over the web, but nothing seems to give me a straightforward method to make the whole thing work.p  pThis is what Ive done so farp  pstrong1strong Created a DataContext classp  precodepublic class DataContext  DbContext  public DataContext  baseDefaultConnection   public DbSetltUserProfilegt UserProfiles  get set   codepre  pstrong2strong Created an initializer class with what I assume would get me the admin user and Admins role createdp  precodepublic class DataContextDbInitializer  DropCreateDatabaseAlwaysltDataContextgt  protected override void SeedDataContext context  var roles  Webmatrix.WebData.SimpleRoleProviderSystem.Web.Security.Roles.Provider var membership  Webmatrix.WebData.SimpleMembershipProviderSystem.Web.Security.Membership.Provider if roles.RoleExistsAdmins  roles.CreateRoleAdmins  if membership.GetUseradmin, false  null  membership.CreateUserAndAccountadmin, 123456  if roles.GetRolesForUseradmin.ContainsAdmins  roles.AddUsersToRolesnew[]  admin , new[]  Admins      codepre  pIve tried inheriting from DropCreateDatabaseIfModelChanges but that doesnt help.p  pstrong3strong Added two lines to the AppStart method in Global.asaxp  precodeWebSecurity.InitializeDatabaseConnectionDefaultConnection, UserProfile, UserId, UserName, autoCreateTables true Database.SetInitializerltDataContextgtnew DataContextDbInitializer codepre  pI also tried using WebSecurity.InitializeDatabaseConnection in the Seed method in my DataContextDbInitializer class, but didnt work.p  pstrong4strong Removed the [InitializeSimpleMembership] annotation from the AccountController, so I can initialize it from the very beginning of the application life cycle using WebSecurity.InitializeDatabaseConnection in AppStart, as Ive explained in number 3. I tried adding [InitializeSimpleMembership] on top of the Index method in the HomeController and removing WebSecurity.InitializeDatabaseConnection from AppStart, but that doesnt help either.p  pstrong5strong In Web.config I have authentication method as Forms default and also left the default connection stringp  precodeltconnectionStringsgt ltadd nameDefaultConnection connectionStringData SourceLocalDbv11.0Initial CatalogaspnetTPFinal20130121210447Integrated SecuritySSPIAttachDBFilenameDataDirectoryaspnetTPFinal20130121210447.mdf providerNameSystem.Data.SqlClient gt ltconnectionStringsgt codepre  pAnd added this inside the system.web tagp  precodeltroleManager enabledtrue cacheRolesInCookietrue gt codepre  pstrong6strong Then, to test if everything works, I use the [AuthorizeRoles  Admins] annotation on top of the About method in the HomeController. If things were working as expected, this should force me to log in as admin123456 in order to be able to see the About page, controlled by HomeControllerAbout.p  pstrong7strong I havent added EF migrations or anything else. All the other stuff is by default as VS2012 automatically created it. So I run my application and click on the About link, and I get presented with the login form that means that the [AuthorizeRoles  Admins] annotation is doing what its expected to do. I attempt to log in as admin123456 but the log in page is reloaded over and over, every time I click on the log in button.p  pA few things I have noticedp  pif I add a breakpoint in the Seed method, it seems its not getting called.p  pwhen I use DropCreateDatabaseAlways and run the application again, Im able to log in as admin123456, which makes me think again that my whole DataContextDbInitializer class is not even being used, since I assume the DB should be created from scratch, which would delete the admin user.p  pI dont know what else to read, what else to try... Im new to asp.net needed I say that and just going nuts. Thanksp

Negative 19392 pHopefully you guys can help me figure out how to do something I havent come across before.p  pI have a table, call it TableA, with many columns. One of them is state, with entries such asp  precodestate MA NJ HI codepre  pand so forth. I would like to create some sort of way to pull these values out into a new foreignkeyed table, call it StateTable, which would have columns statekey and state. p  pFor example, heres how I envision it proceeding rowbyrowp  pRow 1 Value in state column in TableA is MA. Check to see if StateTable has an entry where the state column is MA. If so, get the statekey for that row, and replace the entry in TableA with the foreign key, so that row now has a FK to MA instead of storing that value directly. If StateTable has no MA entry, insert it, and do the same with the new FK. And so on, for each row.p  pSo the end result would be two tablesp  pTableAp  precodestate 1 2 3 codepre  pStateTablep  precodestatekey    state 1            MA 2            NJ 3            HI codepre  pThere shouldnt be any hardcoded stuffs going on because Ill need to do this for other columns as well, like state, that have a somewhat small number of finite values.p  ptldr a way to preserve data in a column while turning the column into a FKd table.p  pAny ideas Thanksp

Negative 19392 pI am making an app in which I have MKMapView with some MKAnnotations on it. I also have a list a UITableView with more info about places represented by those annotations, in which my problem occurs. I use my own UITableViewCell subclass, which has 3 UILabels the default textLabel for name of the place, addressLabel and phoneNumberLabel.

I also have to consider situation, where there is no phone number or address and according UILabels should disappear frame size is 0.p  pProblem is, when I scroll down the table, cells disappear from the upper part of the screen the further I scroll, the more of them are invisible, and for most of the UITableView there are no cells displayed at all, just section headers, even though the size of the whole table doesnt change. p  pscreenshot was supposed to go here, but stackoverflow didnt allow me to post it   [enter image description here][1]p  pHeres my custom UITableViewCell subclassp  precodeimplementation POICell   idinitWithStyleUITableViewCellStylestyle reuseIdentifierNSString reuseIdentifier      self  [super initWithStylestyle reuseIdentifierreuseIdentifier]     if self           Initialization code         self.addressLabel  [[UILabel alloc] init]         self.phoneNumberLabel  [[UILabel alloc] init]         [self addSubviewself.addressLabel]         [self addSubviewself.phoneNumberLabel]         self.addressLabel.font  [UIFont fontWithNameHelvetica size14]         self.phoneNumberLabel.font  [UIFont fontWithNameHelvetica size14]         self.textLabel.font  [UIFont fontWithNameHelveticaBold size20]          self.addressLabel.lineBreakMode  UILineBreakModeWordWrap         self.phoneNumberLabel.lineBreakMode  UILineBreakModeWordWrap         self.textLabel.lineBreakMode  UILineBreakModeWordWrap          return self    voidlayoutSubviews      [super layoutSubviews]      CGRect titleFrame  self.frame     titleFrame.origin.x  30     titleFrame.size.width  60     titleFrame.size.height  [self.textLabel.text sizeWithFontself.textLabel.font forWidthself.textLabel.frame.size.width lineBreakModeNSLineBreakByWordWrapping].height     self.textLabel.frame  titleFrame     if self.addressLabel.text  nil          self.addressLabel.frame  CGRectMaketitleFrame.origin.x, [DDUtility yRelativeToself.textLabel withMargin0], titleFrame.size.width, [self.addressLabel.text sizeWithFontself.addressLabel.font forWidthself.addressLabel.frame.size.width lineBreakModeNSLineBreakByWordWrapping].height          else          self.addressLabel.frame  CGRectMaketitleFrame.origin.x, [DDUtility yRelativeToself.textLabel withMargin0], 0, 0          NSString labelText  self.addressLabel.text     if self.phoneNumberLabel.text  nil          self.phoneNumberLabel.frame  CGRectMaketitleFrame.origin.x, [DDUtility yRelativeToself.addressLabel withMargin0], titleFrame.size.width, [self.phoneNumberLabel.text sizeWithFontself.phoneNumberLabel.font forWidthself.phoneNumberLabel.frame.size.width lineBreakModeNSLineBreakByWordWrapping].height           else          self.phoneNumberLabel.frame  CGRectMaketitleFrame.origin.x, [DDUtility yRelativeToself.addressLabel withMargin0], 0, 0          labelText  self.phoneNumberLabel.text   codepre  pAnd here part of my UIViewController, which is both a delegate and datasource for 2 of my tables  categoryTable works just fine, its poiTable I have problems with.p  ppoiArraysDictionary is a dictionary in which keys are names of the Point of Interest categories and values are arrays of points of this category.

Negative 19392 pOn my website which is run through WordPress, I have a series of clickable image thumbnails. When you hover over a thumbnail, a grey box appears over the thumbnail. This grey box that appears is a clickable link, but only 80 of the grey box is clickable.p  pMy issue is how an iPhone reacts to this box when it is clicked. When you click anywhere outside of the 80 region the clickable region, the grey box appears. This is great. But if you click anywhere within this 80 region, you are automatically brought to the link, instead of the grey box appearing. This may seem a bit confusing in text form, so I drew a picture to showcase my issue  img srchttpi.imgur.comVmYFnRg.jpg altiPhone Hover Problemp  pSo say you are on an iPhone, and you see a thumbnail you want to click on. If you click outside of the 80 region, the grey box appears just like it should.  But if you click within this 80 region the region that is the actual link, then you get redirected to the external source without even seeing the grey hover box that should appear.  This is the problem.  I would like it to work just like how it works on a computer, so if you are on an iPhone and you click anywhere on a thumbnail, the grey hover box should always appear, not redirect you to the external link. Because this 80 region that links a user to an external source on an iphone is set to codedisplaynonecode and is essentially invisible to the user until you hover over a thumbnail.  The user should not be able to click on a link they cannot see.p  pSo how would I make it so that the hover grey box always appears when clicked on an iPhone, no matter where on a thumbnail a user clicks Any suggestions or input would be great.p  pemstrongUpdateemstrongp  pHere is the jquery that makes the grey divs appear via codeopacitycodep  precode document .ready function  .entryimage.mouseoverfunction     show the box     this.children.thumbhover.stop.animateopacity1,300   .entryimage.mouseleavefunction     hide the box     this.children.thumbhover.stop.animateopacity0,500     codepre  pI also added codedisplaynonecode to my thumbhover divs in CSS and codeshowcode to the jquery so the divs are using not display as well as codeopacity0code and then when you hover over them, it hads a block display as well as a codeopacity1codep

Negative 19392 pI am trying to close a C .NET 4 WPF application from a c application. The C app uses the standard technique of enumerating windows, finding the one that corresponds to a given process ID, sending the window a WMCLOSE via PostMessage, then WaitForSingleObjectpid, 5000.

Negative 19392 pI searched a lot about this topic but did not found a convincing answer.p  pI have a branch B that is used for Feature F1, F2 and F3. Commits for the features a mixed e.g. a commit for F1, commit for F2, commit for F1. Feature F1 is now finished should be reintegrated to the trunk but F2 and F3 are not.p  pAs far as I understand it, reintegration to the trunk using reintegrate is different from a normal svn merge and thus svn merge is not usable in this scenario correct. The svnbook mentions such a selective merge as cherrypicking but only from trunkbranch to branch. However, reintegrate would also bring F2 and F3 to the trunk.p  pHow if possible at all can I reintegrate selected revisions from branch B to the trunk and then continue to finish the other features in branch Bp  pSome answers I found mention to svn merge the revisions to trunk and then block those revisions in the branch using recordonly. However, Im not sure if this is good practice due to the fundamental difference of svn merge and svn merge reintegrate. Wouldnt svn merge from branch to trunk duplicate the changesets in the trunk that were previously synced to the branch p

Negative 19392 pI am currently building a small turnedbased maze game. The maze is 2D and build up by tiles  much similar to Zelda map kinda games.p  pI have minimum 256 different tiles to select from and I will be reusing them a lot for different areas, such as buildings, trees, walls, grass, water etc. p  pMy plan is to make it run as smooth as I can without using any other framework than jQuery for Ajax and DOM manipulation.p  pThe gameengine is serverside, so the client browser is not performing any of the AIlogics etc. Its just requesting the current state of the game, then receiving the objectsenemies etc. But it has the levelmap downloaded from the start. The level could be like 256x256 tiles and each tile could be 32x32 pixels... havent decided on the block size yet, but I think thats the most optimal. Might be larger though.p  pThe player viewport will probarbly take up around 9x9 tiles or perhaps 15x15 tiles. Then you will scroll to see action and move around. p  pAs its turnbased, so no worries for screen flickering 60 fps a single flicker here and there is okay, but not all the time.p  pstrongMy question is Whats the most optimal way to generate the map in the clientstrongp  ul li1 should I transfer the map as data json or similar and then generate DIVs with CSS to build the tilemap in the client. This will minimize the bandwidth, but I fear that the DOM in the client will be at hardwork when I scroll the mapli ul  porp  ul li2 should I prerender the full tilemap or larger parts squares of the map so that the browser has less DIVs to handle. This will kill reuseability for the maps as they are hardly patterned, so its just going to be pure graphic download  the tilemap information needed for the game collision etc. It ought to be faster to scroll for the browser.li ul  pI cant figure out if it will take more or less resources once downloaded with the second approach, as the clientbrowser will have to allocate memory for all the larger prerendered blocks instead. But if its the data optimal solution from 1 its also going to be generating a lot of DIVs with class and render these in the browser DOM somehow.p  pSVG and canvas is currently not an option, unless someone can provide me with a fast way of converting alpha transparent PNGs to canvas and still being able to scroll around with a viewport with as many FPS as possible though, aka more than 15 fpsp

Negative 19392 pWe use libpuzzle  a hrefhttpwww.pureftpd.orgprojectlibpuzzledoc relnofollowhttpwww.pureftpd.orgprojectlibpuzzledoca  to compare 4 million images against each other for similarity.p  pIt works quite well.p  pBut rather then doing a image vs image compare using the libpuzzle functions, there is another method of comparing the images.p  pstrongHere is some quick backgroundstrongp  pLibpuzzle creates a rather small 544 bytes hash of any given image. This hash can in turn be used to compare against other hashes using libpuzzles functions. There are a few APIs... PHP, C, etc etc... We are using the PHP API.p  pThe other method of comparing the images is by creating vectors from the given hash, here is a paste from the docsp  blockquote   pCut the vector in fixedlength words. For instance, lets consider the   following vectorp      p[ a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z ]p      pWith a word length K of 10, you can get the following wordsp      p[ a b c d e f g h i j ] found at position 0   [ b c d e f g h i j k ] found at position 1   [ c d e f g h i j k l ] found at position 2   etc. until position N1p      pThen, index your vector with a compound index of word  position.p      pEven with millions of images, K  10 and N  100 should be enough to   have very little entries sharing the same index.p blockquote  pSo, we have the vector method working. Its actually works a bit better then the image vs image compare since when we do the image vs image compare, we use other data to reduce our sample size. Its a bit irrelevant and application specific what other data we use to reduce the sample size, but with the vector method... we would not have to do so, we could do a real test of each of the 4 million hashes against each other.p  pstrongThe issue we have is as followsstrongp  pWith 4 million images, 100 vectors per image, this becomes 400 million rows. We have found MySQL tends to choke after about 60000 images 60000 x 100  6 million rows.p  pstrongThe query we use is as followsstrongp  precodeSELECT isw.itemid, COUNTisw.word as strength FROM vectors isw JOIN vectors iswsearch ON isw.word  iswsearch.word WHERE iswsearch.itemid  ITEM ID TO COMPARE AGAINST ALL OTHER ENTRIES GROUP BY isw.itemid codepre  pAs mentioned, even with proper indexes, the above is quite slow when it comes to 400 million rows.p  pSo, can anyone suggest any other technologies  algos to test these for similarityp  pWe are willing to give anything a shot.p  pstrongSome things worth mentioningstrongp  ol liHashes are binary.li liHashes are always the same length, 544 bytes.li ol  pstrongThe best we have been able to come up with isstrongp  ol liConvert image hash from binary to ascii.li liCreate vectors.li liCreate a string as follows VECTOR1 VECTOR2 VECTOR3 etc etc.li liSearch using sphinx.li ol  pWe have not yet tried the above, but this should probably yield a bit better results than doing the mysql query.p  pAny ideas As mentioned, we are willing to install any new service postgresql hadoop.p  pFinal note, an outline of exactly how this vector  compare method works can be found in question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9703762libpuzzleindexingmillionsofpicturesLibpuzzle Indexing millions of picturesa.

This works While I can write thisp  precodeforeach IFoofoowptr obj, objects  rangemapvalues       IFoofooptr myObj  obj.lock     if myObj  myObjgtnotify  codepre  pId much rather have a new range that transforms to a locked shared pointer. Something like thisp  precodeforeach IFoofooptr obj, objects  rangemapvalues  rangelocked       if obj  objgtnotify  codepre  phowever, Ive been unable to figure out what that transform should look like or if it should even be a transform.p  pDoes anyone have an idea Im convinced this pattern may quite common.p
Negative 19392 pIve got the following data modelp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comMSdmz.png altmy core data model .p  pAs you can see each client can be tethered to Agency by its id. I have a UITableView with NSFetchedResultsController. Id like to output the clients name and the clients agency if it exists. Now Im doing it with the following codep  precodeCDClient client[self.fetchedResultsController objectAtIndexPaththeIndexPath] [cell.textLabel setTextclient.name]  NSFetchRequest fr[[NSFetchRequest alloc] init] [fr setEntity[NSEntityDescription entityForNameAgency inManagedObjectContextself.context]] [fr setPredicate[NSPredicate predicateWithFormatserverid  , client.agencyserverid]] NSArray agencies[self.context executeFetchRequestfr errornil] if[agencies count]lt0      cell.detailTextLabel.textNo agencies  else if[agencies count]1      cell.detailTextLabel.textCDAgency [agencies objectAtIndex0].name  else      cell.detailTextLabel.textmultiple agencies  codepre  pHeres my table view setup methodp  precodevoidreloadTableView      AppDelegate appdelAppDelegate [UIApplication sharedApplication].delegate     self.context[appdel managedObjectContext]     [self.context setStalenessInterval0]      NSFetchRequest fetchRequest  [[NSFetchRequest alloc] init]     NSEntityDescription callEntity[NSEntityDescription entityForNameClient inManagedObjectContextself.context]     [fetchRequest setEntitycallEntity]      NSSortDescriptor sortByNameDescriptor  [[NSSortDescriptor alloc] initWithKeyname ascendingYES selectorselectorcaseInsensitiveCompare]     NSArray sortDescriptors  [[NSArray alloc] initWithObjects sortByNameDescriptor, nil]     [fetchRequest setSortDescriptorssortDescriptors]         self.fetchedResultsController  [[NSFetchedResultsController alloc] initWithFetchRequestfetchRequest managedObjectContextself.context sectionNameKeyPathnil cacheNamenil]     self.fetchedResultsController.delegate  self       NSError error  nil     if [self.fetchedResultsController performFetchamperror]              NSLogUnresolved error , , [error localizedDescription], [error localizedFailureReason]         abort           [self.rootTableView reloadData]  codepre  pEverything works perfectly but I need certain improvements.p  pI need to add a NSSortDescriptor to sort the data by agencies name. It can be done easily if client and agency tables had a relationship between them. So I could just use the dot to get access to clients agency. But how can it be done if Agency and Client are not directly tethered. You can check the code in my cell configuration method where Im getting an agency for client. But how can I do the same in NSSortDescriptor or NSPredicatep  pWhat if I need to fetch all the client which have an agency which name contains certain characters Help me please, how to construct a predicatep  pPlease feel free to ask me any questions.p

Negative 19392 pIm running a system with a few workers thats taking jobs from a message queue, all using Djangos ORM. In one case Im actually passing a message along from one worker to another in another queue. It works like thisp  ul liWorker1 in queue1 creates an object MySQL INSERT and pushes a message to queue2li liWorker2 accepts the new message in queue2 and retrieves the object MySQL SELECT, using Djangos objects.getpkobjectidli ul  pThis works for the first message. But in the second message worker 2 always fails on that it cant find object with id objectid with Django exception DoesNotExist.p  pThis works seamlessly in my local setup with Django 1.2.3 and MySQL 5.1.66, the problem occurs  only in my test environment which runs Django 1.3.1 and MySQL 5.5.29.p  pIf I restart worker2 every time before worker1 pushes a message, it works fine.

Negative 19392 pMy question is about finding the good way of defining a function whose implementation differs according to a given criterion. This function will be called from several scripts, therefore I must place it in a module.p  pFor the sake of example, my criterion concerns which platform the script is run on, but be clear that the test could bear upon anything. My functions allow persistent definitionretrieving of environment variables, so I created a module named persistenv.py according to the following scheme SOLUTION 1 p  precode CROSSPLATFORM PART def myfunction1       ... body1 ...   WINDOWSONLY PART if sys.platform.lower.startswithwin      def myfunction2           ...body2 for Windows...   LINUXONLY PART elif sys.platform.lower.startswithlinux      def myfunction2           ...body2 for Linux...  else      raise ImportErrorYour platform is not supported codepre  pThe above introduces two possible definitions of the same function in a single module. Anyway, it sounded pretty much cleaner to me than testing the platform each time the function was called SOLUTION 2 p  precode CROSSPLATFORM PART def myfunction1       ... body1 ...   def myfunction2        WINDOWSONLY PART     if sys.platform.lower.startswithwin           ...body2 for Windows...

Negative 19392 pI am doing some research to see whether I can automaticallyprogramatically validate a distribution.dist file that came from a valid os x pkgdmg.p  pHere is the situation I have some valid os x applications in dmg and pkg format. I have extracted their distribution.dist files and would like to determine which machines lets assume there are many these packages would install successfully on. I dont want to copy the entire pkgdmg files to every machine and then run the installer command to see if the installation would succeed or fail. This would consume excessive bandwidthresources. Instead, I would like to do something more lightweight like use a scriptcommandbinary that could evaluate only the distribution.dist requirements on the machine and then return if they are met or not.p  pI figure the hardest part of solving this problem would be how the Installer Javascript scripts would be executedevaluated. Since I do not see that Apple has given external access to those particular libraries. p  pOne idea I have is to use pkgbuild and create pkg files with no payload. Then I could use the usrsbininstaller command to install these empty pkgs. The install checks would be performed and the file size would be small. However, I am hoping there is a more elegant way of solving this problem.p  pThanks.p

Negative 19392 pI recently had a problem regarding not being able to register touches events codetouchesMovedcode, etc from within a codeUIScrollViewcode. After talking with lots of people and reading tons of posts, it turns out codeUIScrollViewcode doest accept touches itself, and instead the touches need to be passed to a codeUIScrollViewcode subclass.p  pI am very new to objectivec, and am having a terrible time wrapping my head around how subclasses are defined in separate .h.m files or somehow in interface or something, as well as how iOS deals with responder chains. p  pPlease let me describe my exact situation, and anyone willing to explain what I need to do in noobspeak will be really appreciated. p  pI have a single page in my app, and I changed its default codeUIViewcode to codeUIScrollViewcode, so if I inspect it in codeInterfaceBuidlercode all I see is my codeSampleViewControllercode and codeUIScrollViewcode. I linked my codeUIScrollViewcode to the codeInterfacecode of codeSampleViewControler.hcode like thisp  precodeimport ltUIKitUIKit.hgt interface SampleViewController  UIViewController   property strong, nonatomic IBOutlet UIScrollView mainScroller end codepre  pAnd I referenced my codeUIScrollViewcode  in codeSampleViewController.mcode like thisp  precodeimport SampleViewController.h interface SampleViewController  end  implementation SampleViewController synthesize mainScroller  mainScroller   voidtouchesMovedNSSet touches withEventUIEvent event      NSLogMovement   voidviewWillAppearBOOLanimated      [mainScroller setContentOffsetCGPointMake0,0 animatedYES]  codepre  pIf I change the class of codeUIScrollViewcode to codeUIViewcode, the touches are detected and I fire off a few codeNSLogcode messages. However, once codeUIViewcode is set back to codeUIScrollViewcode, touches are ignored.p  pFrom what I understand I need to setup a subclass of codeUIScrollViewcode with the codep  precode voidtouchesMovedNSSet touches withEventUIEvent event      NSLogMovement  codepre  p...and then change my SampleViewController.m to have the codep  precode voidtouchesMovedNSSet touches withEventUIEvent event      [[self.nextResponder nextResponder] touchesMovedtouches withEventevent]  codepre  pHowever, I really dont understand 1 how to setup such a subclass, and 2 why this would work, since I dont see why code[[self.nextResponder nextResponder] touchesMovedtouches withEventevent]code would ever be called in the first place from within codeSampleViewController.mcode, since my similar codeNSLogMovementcode statement is never executed.p  pI have tried every tutorial I could find, and am turning toward to the expertise of SE Thanks.p

Negative 19392 pIm having a hard time asking the question so let me explain to you our half baked OAuth 2.0 solutionp  pCurrently, we only use a trusted grant, rather we ask for a username and password. If those creds are authenticated successfully, we issue an access token and a refresh token. However, there is no scope information in that response message. The OAuth2 spec says that if a scope is provided in a request, then it needs to be returned in the response as well, but only if the granted scope is different from the requested scope. In any were not assigning a scope to the toke, only a token that says that the user is validated. This doesnt feel right to me, but maybe Im over thinking it.p  pLater on in our flow, the client will attempt to access a protected resource such as logging int to a website that is only granted to a certain role. So while you may be authenticated you possess an access token, you may not be allowed to log into this site due to your role. The way that we currently validate this is by sending the access token to the resource endpoint. That endpoint then sends the token along with the uri that youre tryin to access to our validation server which validates that your token is good and that your role which we look up by the token entry in the databasepermits you to access the resource, then return a 200 to allow you to continue or a 403 that says you dont have access to that endpoint. So in other words, the access token doesnt have any scope assigned to it directly, rather it just tells us who you are, then we look up your permissions and compare it to the request and say yay or nay. This seem weird to me. p  pIn other implementations that Ive seen, I got the impression that it is supposed to actually work like thisp  ul liyou request an access token, if your creds are validated successfully then a token is generated.li liThe auth server then looks at your requested scope, then generates a token in a database along with the approved portion of your requested scope partial or complete. Rather, if you requested a b c and d, but only b and d where approved then the token stored in our database would reflect that only b and c are permitted with that token.li liThe token string along with the approved scope is sent back to the client.li liDuring a protected resource request, we look up the token in the database and compare the requested resource with what is in the scope entry for the provided token, then return yay or nay, rather than looking up the user permissions.li ul  pSo whats the difference I was under the impression that a TOKEN contains the scope. So if user A is allowed resources A B C D and E, but requests B C and F, then the token will only be good for B and C. We dont simple grant A because he is permitted to do so he didnt ask for A D or E and he is not permitted F so the token does not permit them. Does that make sensep  pSo my question is this. Is our current implementation wrong based on my understanding of the way its supposed to be used Is my understanding correctp

Negative 19392 pI have successfully build a small UI widget in Ember.JS using JSFiddle. Works fine with the Emberdata Fixture Adaptor but I wanted to take it into a local environment and thought Id use Brunch to build the environment for me. Since that time Ive wasted a full day trying to get it work and Im hoping that someone can help me get over this hump. My strong suspicion at this time is that the remaining problem is either a namespace or sequencing issues that arises out of the commonjs packaging that Brunch does for you. Im quite new to commonjs so it may be that this is just a simple lack of understanding ... heres the basic problemp  ul liWhen I run the application and move to the codeactivitiescode template I get a codeAssertion failed Your application does not have a Store property definedcode error. li ul  pMy initialisation file looks like thisp  precode Namespace App  requireapp   Router  App.Router.mapfunction      this.resourceindex,  path  , function      this.resourceactivities,  path activities , function      this.resourcehi,  path hi , function      Routes  requireroutesActivitiesRoute    Store  requirestoresFixture    Models  requiremodelsActivity    Views     Controllers   require controllersActivitiesController    Template Helpers  requirehelperstime    Templates  require templatesapplication require templateshi require templatesactivities codepre  pA working example of the code  albeit without commonjs and brunch  can be found in this JSBin a hrefhttpjsbin.comoyosev56edit relnofollowhttpjsbin.comoyosev56edita. When running it locally, it loads up the index page and can navigate back and forth between the hi page and the index without incident. The problem happens when you linkTo the Activities viewtemplatecontroller. The Activities  of course  is the only viewcontroller that is backed by a model. As I understand it, the flow starts with my ActivitiesRoutep  precodeApprequireapp  console.logActivitiesRoute file loaded module.exports  App.ActivitiesRoute  Ember.Route.extend      init function          console.logActivitesRoute instantiated     ,      model function          return App.Activity.find        codepre  pIt successfully instantiates the object as will be seen in the following log file but then tries to load the Activity model and this is where it notices ... hey, you havent defined the Store yet. The problem is ... we have or at least we have attempted to. For reference purposes here are the console messages that help to tell the execution storyp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comKaoXr.png altconsole logp  pThe first important thing to notice is that the initialisation script we have included the line coderequirestoresFixturescode which should lead to an instantiation of DS.Store that is stored in the App.Store property.

Negative 19392 pSo, I have a custom QLabel class that Im using as a button. When the label is clicked, the background color changes from red to green. On the mouse release event, the background goes back to red. However, if I add a slot to the widgets clicked signal, the mouse release event appears to never be fired. The label stays green. At the moment, I have it so when the label is clicked, a QMessageBox is displayed. Yet, even after the messagebox is closed, the label stays green. I tried connecting its focusOutEvent to the same slot that turned the background red, yet its still not working.

Negative 19392 pIm trying to reproduce the sample app from this a hrefhttpscode.google.complibgdxwikiSimpleApp relnofollowlibgdx tutoriala in clojure and am having a hard time getting the java interop part working.p  pThe way a desktop game is created in libgdx is by instantiating the codeLwjglApplicationcode class with an object that implements the codeApplicationListenercode interface, along with some configuration options, like sop  precodeimport com.badlogic.gdx.backends.lwjgl.LwjglApplication  public class Main     public static void mainString[] args      new LwjglApplicationnew DropGame, cfg       public class DropGame implements ApplicationListener      Texture dropImage     Sound dropSound          ... rest of assets       public void create        dropImage  new TextureGdx.files.internaldroplet.png       dropSound  Gdx.audio.newSoundGdx.files.internaldrop.wav          ... rest of interface methods      codepre  pAfter reading up on clojurejava interop, here is the clojure equivalent I came up withp  precodens dropgame.core   genclass   import com.badlogic.gdx.backends.lwjgl LwjglApplication  defn applistener []      reify ApplicationListener       create [this] let [dropImage Texture.            .internal Gdxfiles droplet.png                            dropSound .newSound Gdxaudio .internal Gdxfiles drop.wav]  defn App []    LwjglApplication. applistener cfg codepre  pI left out a lot of the code, but thats fine because the app works using this structure. The problem is that this code is not exactly the same. The libgdx framework chooses to declare all assets globally dropImage and dropSound in this case so that code in other methods has easy access to them without needing to pass them around. If I try to restructure my code to do the same, by declaring assets in an outer let binding instead of inside a method, it no longer works.p  pDoing this gives me a nullPointerExceptionp  precodedefn applistener []    let [dropImage Texture.            .internal Gdxfiles droplet.png         dropSound .newSound Gdxaudio .internal Gdxfiles drop.wav]     reify ApplicationListener       create [this]   try accessing dropImage or dropSound codepre  pSo the let binding is creating the same objects, but accessing these object from inside any of the methods no longer seems to work. Any ideas what Im doing wrong here p  pstrongEDITstrong So as mentioned, the reason why I was getting a nullPointerException is probably because the assets were being loaded before the app was ready. But anyway the proper way to load assets for anything beyond a simple game is to use the AssetManager, as muhuk suggested. So I ended up doing something like this for assetsp  precodedef assetmanager doto AssetManager.                    .load rain.mp3    Music                    .load droplet.png Texture codepre  pHowever there are other things besides assets that need to be accessed globally, for example the camera. So what I did for these is this p  precodedefn applistener []   reify ApplicationListener     create [this]       def camera gt OrthographicCamera. .setToOrtho false 800 480  codepre  pWhile this would probably raise alarms in any normal clojure code, since you have a function defining global values, in this particular case it actually makes sense since applistener is only getting instantiated once, and a hrefhttpscode.google.complibgdxwikiApplicationLifeCycle relnofollowthe documentationa specifies that the create method only gets called once too during the apps life cycle. Though Id still like to know if theres a better way to do this.        p  pAs for using deftype, my understanding is that defrecord would be easier to use since it allows for passing a map of additional fields without having to declare them in the constructor. But in either case the code ended up looking pretty messy since you have to pass all your assets to the constructor. In addition to that, defining a named type kind of obscures what the code is doing and doesnt fit very nicely with the problem.p  pIm gonna finish up the rest of the tutorial and post a link to the clojure code once Im done. Thanks guys.  p

Negative 19392 pIm setting up a Transfer SQL Server Objects Task and cant seem to specify existing Connection Managers for it. When parametrizing the Connection Managers it creates, there isnt an Initial Catalog parameter. My package is defined only for serverdbuserpassword parameters. How can I feed this thing a connection string without making it a parameter of the package Make a subpackage and pass it a connection Is there a better way Maybe use a variable for the connection string parameter somehowp

Negative 19392 pIm using codeAVPlayercode for live audio streams. If I pause the player and resume, it picks up where it left off which is great. Except if the player has been paused for so long that it stops getting new data from the network. In that case, when playback resumes, it first plays any buffered data and then switches to live data.p  pThis is really annoying. It sounds like you just picked up where you left off but then, surprise, you jump ahead. The switch from hearing old prepause buffer data to hearing new live audio sucks.p  pWhat Id like to do is, when the pause is long, release the codeAVPlayercode. That way if the user presses play again they get only new live audio, not the old buffered data. I know that will mean a delay before playback begins, but I think thats better than the audio discontinuity Im getting now.p  pI dont see any way to detect this situation. I thought I could observe codeplaybackBufferFullcode on the current codeAVPlayerItemcode, but that never seems to change. Even when Instruments shows no incoming network traffic, playbackBufferFull is still 0.p  pAt the moment Im just using a twominute timeout, i.e. if playback doesnt resume within two minutes, release the AVPlayer. If the user later presses play, start fresh with a new player. Experimentally, two minutes seems to be not terrible, though not actually good. Is there a better way to do thisp

Negative 19392 h2Conciseish problem explanationh2  pId like to be able to run multiple well say a few hundred shell commands, each of which starts a long running process and blocks for hours or days with at most a line or two of output this command is simply a job submission to a cluster. This blocking is helpful so I can know exactly when each finishes, because Id like to investigate each result and possibly rerun each multiple times in case they fail. My program will act as a sort of controller for these programs.p  precodefor all commands in parallel      submitjobandwait     tries  1     while  jobwassuccessful and tries lt 3         resubmitwithextramemoryandwait         tries       codepre  h2What Ive triedinvestigatedh2  pI was so far thinking it would be best to create a thread for each submission which just blocks waiting for input. There is enough memory for quite a few waiting threads. But from what Ive read, perl threads are closer to duplicate processes than in other languages, so creating hundreds of them is not feasible nor does it feel right.p  pThere also seem to be a variety of eventloopish cooperative systems like codeAnyEventcode and codeCorocode, but these seem to require you to rely on asynchronous libraries, otherwise you cant really do anything concurrently. I cant figure out how to make multiple shell commands with it. Ive tried using codeAnyEventUtilruncmdcode, but after I submit multiple commands, I have to specify the order in which I want to wait for them. I dont know in advance how long each submission will take, so I cant coderecvcode without sometimes getting very unlucky. This isnt really parallel.p  precodemy cv1  runcmdqsub sync y sleep RANDOM my cv2  runcmdqsub sync y sleep RANDOM   Now should I cv1gtrecv first or cv2gtrecv Who knows  Out of 100 submissions, I may have to wait on the longest one before processing any. codepre  pMy understanding of AnyEvent and friends may be wrong, so please correct me if so. p  pThe other option is to run the job submission in its nonblocking form and have it communicate its completion back to my process, but the interprocess communication required to accomplish and coordinate this across different machines daunts me a little. Im hoping to find a local solution before resorting to that.p  pIs there a solution Ive overlookedp

Negative 19392 pId like to clean up some dependent data in this case, remove webgl textures from the GPU when a Javascript object in this case, representing a shape to be drawn goes out of scope  just before it is garbagecollected.

I can only surmise this is because the aspect ratio of the video is affecting this   Is there a way to override thisp  pStrangley, If I change the top and left attributes on videobackground to bottom right, the video will move to the top of the page and bar appears on the bottom.  However, as the monitor shrinks, the video gets pushed up off the page cutting off the heads of the people on the videop  pAm I going all wrong here  Is there an easier way to achieve this  I have tried various javascripts but to no avail.p

Negative 19392 pI have an iOS app where half the users want to use iCloud to synch some data between devices, and the other half dont.  For this reason I put the Core Datas iCloud enabled sqlite file in the application document directories. The iCloud syncs work nicely when they are signed in to iCloud.  However, if a user is not signed in.But if user not sign in then the sync data not merge with icloud data. The transactions logs obviously dont get created because the user is not using iCloud. However, the user may start using iCloud at a later date.   For this reason I think I need to create a second fallback persistent store that gets used when not signed into iCloud. If the user signs in later I would merge the fallback store with the iCloud enabled store.   My question is, does anybody know how I could easily merge the fallback non iCloud store with the iCloud enabled store. Secondly, does anybody have a better design as far as persistent store locations go  Any ideas are appreciated. Thanks,p

Negative 19392 pI am processing large xml files with codelxml.iterparsecode. This works well, but as my files got a lot bigger lately, I found iterparse behaviour that filled my memory. Consider the following code, that writes a file with 300000 elements of one sort and 300000 codeelemcode elements and 300000 codeotherelemcode elementsp  precodeels  ltelemgtltsubel1gt0ltsubel1gtltsubel2gt0ltsubel2gtltsubel3gt0ltsubel3gtltsubel4gt0ltsubel4gtltsubel5gt0ltsubel5gtltsubel6gt0ltsubel6gtltelemgt.formatx for x in range300000 otherels  ltotherelemgtltsubel1gt0ltsubel1gtltsubel2gt0ltsubel2gtltsubel3gt0ltsubel3gtltsubel4gt0ltsubel4gtltsubel5gt0ltsubel5gtltsubel6gt0ltsubel6gtltotherelemgt.formatx for x in range300000  with opentmptest.xml, w as fp    fp.writeltrootgtn    fp.writeltelementsgtn    for el in els        fp.writeeln    fp.writeltelementsgtn    fp.writeltotherelementsgtn    for el in otherels        fp.writeeln    fp.writeltotherelementsgtn    fp.writeltrootgtn codepre  pI then use the following to parse only the codeelemcode and do nothing with them, while printing memory usage from time to timep  precodefrom lxml import etree import psutil import os  process  psutil.Processos.getpid gen  etree.iterparsetmptest.xml, tagelem elscount  0 for ac,el in gen     elscount  1     el.clear     if el.getprevious is not None         delel.getparent[0]     if elscount  10000  0         print process.getmemoryinfo.rss10241024  print process.getmemoryinfo.rss10241024 codepre  pThe output shows low memory usage until the end, when it suddenly jumps. This behaviour disappears when I try to read a file that does not contain the codeotherelemcodes. A slower workaround that leaves out the codetagcode argument to iterparse and instead uses an if construct to test for that leaves the memory free, possibly because it can do codeel.clearcode on the elements that dont match. My question is therefore not how to solve this, but why does iterparse waste memory on the elements it does not have to output, or possibly, what am I doing wrong herep

Negative 19392 pI have a javascript script that changes an images src when clicked. When I had the same application in pure php without Codeigniter I simply had the images src be something like imagesimagename where images was the images folder, but now Im using Codeigniter I dont know how to do it. I cant use php inside the JS script obviously so cant use the baseurl or siteurl functions or anything, so I suppose only the absolute path would work. And my images are in an images folder thats inside an assets folder which is at the root i.e. at the same level as the Application, System and Userguide folders. So what should the images src be Thanks.p

Negative 19392 pI have developed a bulletin board from scratch using CodeIgniter, PHP, and PDO for MySQL. Now Im currently cleaning it up and testing for defects  security flaws. I came across a minor defect that I cannot think of a solid solution for. Users can flood my database with random comments that are not even associated with any forum posts. To better describe this issue let me briefly explain my system.p  pWhen you sign in to view a post, the post object along with any related comments via codepostidcode are pulled from the database. You can choose to read the post and leave your own comment. The comment form towards the bottom has a hidden field called codepidcode which stores the id of the current post we are viewing so I can keep the state when you click the submit button. However there is a downfall to this. The hidden field can be modified to whatever integer value before being submitted as you could probably guess.p  pThe URL scheme looks something like when youre viewing a postp  pcodehttpwww.domain.comforumpost22codep  pAnd after pressing submit, you will be redirected to a URL that looks likep  pcodehttpwww.domain.comforumcreatecommentcodep  p... where the comment information will be inserted into the database along with associated user id and post id.p  pI tried testing against a referer URL but the case is similar. Ive came up with several solutions but I dont know if any of them are idea Enforcing JavaScript, storing the codepidcode into a session, andor obsucating the information hidden in the field.p

Negative 19392 pI was wondering if it is possible to send via GSM protocol and appropriate AT commands, few data through a simple GSM call witout using data traffic. For example my system is a PIC  GSM Module and it monitors and processes a string of data.  When the user wishes, he makes a voice call in order to interacts with the GSM module via DTMF commands  for example via an APP.  My dubt is if the GSM module is able to send the data to thesmartphone in order to monitor the status of the system. The module is a Quectel M95. During some investigation, I saw that the module can send USSD codes but I dont know if its possible to customize the USSD and read it from the smartphone as I wish.  Or maybe is it possible to use the FAX for data exchangep  pThanks everybody in advancep  pMarcop

Negative 19392 pI have program where the user selects a block and can move it around the screen however, the blocks that are inside the region of the main block need to move in relation to the main blocks motion. p  pI accomplished this by making a QGraphicsItemGroup of these blocks and setting the right flags.p  precode    dragGroup  thisgtscenegtcreateItemGroupitems     thisgtdragGroupgtsetHandlesChildEventstrue     thisgtdragGroupgtsetFlagItemIsMovable codepre  pThis, consequently, ignores the main items mouseReleaseEvent where the group is dismantled.

However, I am not sure how to attach to the target process from kernel or kernel module, assuming that the target process does not initiate any system call.

Negative 19392 pI wrote a simple assembly program that gets two integers from the user via a prompt, multiplies them together and prints that out. I wanted to do this directly with codesysreadcode and not codescanfcode so I could manually convert the input to an integer after removing the codeLFcode.p  pHeres the full source a hrefhttppastebin.comutnjTvNZ relnofollowhttppastebin.comutnjTvNZap  pIn particular, what I want to do now is manually add a newline to the result of the multiplication that is now converted back to its ASCII char equivalent. Initially, I thought I could just left shift 16 bits and add code0xAcode leaving me with, for example, code0x0034000Acode on the stack for code22 0x0034 is 4 in ASCII charscode, followed by a null terminator and a codeLFcode. However, the codeLFcode is printing before the result. I figured this was an endianess thing, so I tried the reverse code0x000A0034code and that just printed some other ASCII char instead.p  pSo, simply, how do I properly push a newline to the stack so that this is printed with a newline following the number when using codesyswritecode What Im missing is how strings are stored on the stack... which I cant test because normally you just create a variable and push the address onto the stack.p  pIm aware some things in here could be done better, cleaner and uptostandards and whatnot. I understand things intuitively so its something I just need to do to better understand the stack and Linux system calls in general.p

Negative 19392 pIm a heavy Vim user and I intend to rewrite my python program entirely as an Vim extension, the  idea is to have Vim act as an textbased UI for the program.

Since Vim and Python will become one, I dont need to log to a seperate entity like a file or a socket, I only need to log to a live Python object, to say a list, and to view that list through a Vim window.

Negative 19392 pIm guessing this is not possible, at least with the standard HMM implementation of scikitlearn, but I wanted to ask this question to see if there are any other approaches to this issue.p  pThe problem is basically that I want to use a hidden markov model to fit some set of observations sequences however, the observations I have are not always aligned to the same time step. So for instance, I might have two sequences that I want to use for fitting likep  precodeobs1  [1,2,3,4] obs2  [1,2,2,4] codepre  pHowever, these are not necessarily evenly spaced in time. So it might be that say the observations in codeobs1code were observed at times code1,2,3,6code, and the observations in codeobs2code were observed at times code1,4,5,6code. Therefore it seems wrong to feed them into an HMM as is. p  pWhat I tried so far is interpolating the observations so that the time steps are the same. So the examples above would becomep  precodeobs1  [1,2,3,3,3,4] obs2  [1,1,1,2,2,4] codepre  pThis seems to work relatively well for my machine learning problem however, it slows down the fitting considerably because of the large numbers of additional samples the observations are relatively sparse so adding these interpolations adds hundreds of additional observations. Is there any other way to do itp

Negative 19392 pI have a page with a table on it. Two of the columns in the table are checkbox columns. Each has a different Id value. Im trying to count, via jQuery, the number of rows in the table where one of the checkbox columns which has an Id value of InChecklist is checked. My JS function looks as followsp  precodefunction UpdateCount      var totalRows  checklistTable tbody trvisible.length     var totalSeen  inputInChecklist[checkedchecked].length     rowCount.texttotalRows.toString   species    totalSeen   seen  codepre  pThe total row count is fine. But I must not have the syntax correct for the total seen because I cannot get it to count correctly the value is always zero.

Negative 19392 pIm trying to find the correct way to store in a database amp authenticate a user who logged into my app using facebookp  pSo the first time the user logs into the app, a webservice sees this user isnt in the database and inserts its data. The second time the user logs in, the app contacts the webservice and gets some information about this user, only available to the user himself, such as his api key for communicating with the webservice.p  pBut this requires authentication, so the webservice wont give the api key to anyone but the user. Its easy to authenticate the client using facebook on clientside, but then how would the webservice know this authentication took place Ive read a lot on this issue here on SO and came to realize I should store the hashed OAuth access token as the users password, and then send this token on login to the webservice so it could match between the stored token in the database and the received token, thus authenticate the user.p  pstrongBut, tokens expirestrong. So when this token expires, the user should reauthenticate on clientside using facebook and the webservice should recieve a new token. At this point, the webservice would try to match between this new token and the old one stored in the database, and it would fail. So the webservice should update the token and then authenticate it but how can the webservice know that this token has originated from the app and is valid, and not a token sent by someone else How can the webservice even know the old token expired, and not that someone is just trying to cause this token replacment to occur eg. an attacker sending random password. This token replacement basically breaks the whole point of storing the token in the first place, since any different token would just replace the old one.p  pSo basically the problem is  how can I securely update an existing users token once the previous one expiredp  pI apologize for the long text to read, Ive been studying this issue for 2 days now and Im just missing something important.p

Negative 19392 pIve been looking on the web regarding CORS, and I wanted to confirm if whatever I made of it is, what it actually is.p  pstrongMentioned below is a totally fictional scenario.strongp  pIll take an example of a normal website. Say my html page has a form that takes a text field name. On submitting it, it sends the form data to codemyPage.phpcode. Now, what happens internally is that, the server sends the request to codewww.mydomain.commydirectorymyPage.phpcode along with the text fields. Now, the server sees that the request was fired off from the same domainportprotocolp  pstrongemQuestion 1. How does server know about all these details. Where does it extract all these details fromsemstrongp  pNonetheless, since the request is originated from same domain, it server the php script and returns whatever is required off it.p  pNow, for the sake of argument, lets say I dont want to manually fill the data in text field, but instead I want to do it programmatically. What I do is, I create a html page with javascript and fire off a POST request along with the parameters i.e. values of textField. Now since my request is not from any domain as such, the server disregards the service to my request. and I get cross domain error p  pSimilarly, I could have written a Java program also, that makes use of HTTPClientPost request and do the same thing. p  pstrongemQuestion 2  Is this what the problem isemstrong p  pNow, what CORS provide us is, that the server will say that anyone can access myPage.php.  From a hrefhttpenablecors.orgserver.htmlenable cors.orga it says that p  blockquote   pFor simple CORS requests, the server only needs to add the following header to its response   AccessControlAllowOrigin p blockquote  pNow, what exactly is the client going to do with this header. As in, the client anyway wanted to make call to the resources on server right It should be upto server to just configure itself with whether it wants to accept or not, and act accordingly. p  pstrongemQuestion 3  Whats the use of sending a header back to client who has already made a request to the serveremstrongp  pAnd finally, what I dont get is that, say I am building some RESTful services for my android app. Now, say I have one POST service codewww.mydomain.comrestservicesmyPostcode. Ive got my Tomcat server hosting these services on my local machine.p  pIn my android app, I just call this service, and get the result back if any. Where exactly did I use CORS in this case. Does this fall under a different category of server calls If yes, then how exactly. p  pFurthermore, I checked a hrefhttpenablecors.orgservertomcat.htmlEnable Cors for Tomcata and it says that I can add a filter in my web.xml of my dynamic web project, and then it will start accepting it. p  pstrongemQuestion 4  Is that what is enabling the calls from my android device to my webservicesemstrongp  pThanksp

Negative 19392 pHow  can I make sure a project that is shown in my workspace is actually part of the workspace.  Below, I will explain what happened so that you know why Im asking this question.p  pI had checked out a project into my workspace, and then had configured it as a Maven project by selecting ConfigureConvert to Maven Project in most cases, when I do this, the project becomes part of the workspace.  But in this case it hadnt.  But I spent a few hours before realizing that I need to import the project in order for the workspace to recognize it as workspace project.  So, I want to avoid this situation and be able to look at a flag or file or something that tells me if a project that is shown in the Eclipse window is actually a workspace project.p  pThanks p  pIm adding the following to make the  problem more clearp  pThis is what I do I have a workspace with a few projects all JavaMaven project everything works. Then I checkout another project from svn into the workspace so, the folder of the new project is within the same workspace. I expected that as soon as I check out the new project into the workspace, and convert the new project into a Maven project, then the new project be recognized by Eclipse as one of the projects in the workspace. But that is not the case I actually have to import it.p  pThe project folder is there, and I can see it in the Project explorer. Nothing happens to it, but it is not used by the workspace. For example, if I add breakpoints to the Java files which are in the new project, they are not used. At this point, I use FileImport menu to import the project from the same folder that is already in the workspace, and bang, it starts working, and my breakpoints work.p  pIs my procedure for checking out a project from SVN into the workspace wrong I want to fix my procedure to make sure this will never happen. Do you think that even though the new project is a subfolder of workspace, I should still need to import the project into the workspacep  hr  pI just noted another fact this particular project that Im importing is a Maven multimodule could it be that the parent project is actually part of the workspace, but the modules inside it are not therefore, just because it is a Maven multimodule, I need to import the submodules.p

Negative 19392 pI have a series of measurement data  time series in the same interval of 15 minutes. Furthermore, I have a given period e.g. one day, current week, month, year, ... and I need to summarize values by hour, day, month, .... p  pE.g. summarize all values of the last month, by day. p  pMy approach is to generate a temporary array with the needed interval per period in the first step.

After a bit of testing and debugging it looks like, somehow, when using codeProcess.Startcode, it makes the targeted exe run from the location of the parent program that launched it, rather than from the location where that exe is actually located.p  pWhy does this happen Is this intentional design Needless to say this completely messes up the targeted app that you run, so how should this method of launching another exe be usedp  pstrongHeres an example to demonstrate the problemstrongp  pLets create a simple small app that searches for a file and prints success if it finds it, and fail if it doesnt.p  precodeusing System using System.IO using System.Windows.Forms  namespace Testapp      public partial class Form1  Form              public Form1                      InitializeComponent                   private void button1Clickobject sender, EventArgs e                      try                              if File.Exists.testtest.txt                                      MessageBox.ShowProgram executed successfully                                  else                                      MessageBox.ShowProgram failed to execute properly                                           catchException ex                              MessageBox.Showex.ToString                             codepre  pThe intended folder structure of the above program looks like thisp  precodeTestapp Folder gtTestapp.exe gtTest Folder   gttest.txt codepre  pThe program goes into the Test folder, if it exists, and searches for the test.txt file.p  pNow lets make a quick launcher app that will be used to run our test appp  precodeusing System using System.Diagnostics using System.Windows.Forms  namespace LaunchTestApp      public partial class Form1  Form              public Form1                      InitializeComponent                   private void button1Clickobject sender, EventArgs e                      try                              Process.Start.Testapp.exe                          catch Exception ex                              MessageBox.Showex.ToString                             codepre  pThe above application is intended to reside in the same directory as our Testapp.exe.

The codeLaunchappcode runs our codeTestappcode, and we can click on the button in our codeTestappcode and see a messagebox that the program had executed successfully.p  pstrongHoweverstrong, now lets make a slight change to our launching application. Our launching application will now reside on one directory level above our Testapp.exe, like sop  precodeLaunching App Folder gtLaunchapp.exe gtTestapp Folder   gtTestapp.exe   gtTest Folder     gtTest.txt codepre  pNaturally, we also change our Launchapp to target our Testapp.exe in a different directory, like sop  precodeProcess.Start.TestappTestapp.exe codepre  pNow when the codeLaunchappcode is run, and it consequently runs codeTestapp.execode, and we press our button, our codeTestapp.execode displays a message that the program strongfailedstrong to run properly.p  pAt this point, if we go back to our codeTestappcode code and change the location to search for the test.txt from code.testtest.txtcode to code.Testapptesttest.txtcode, then the program will run successfully.p  pThis demonstrates that the codeTestappcode exe seems to be running from the location of codeLaunchappcode, rather than from the location of where codeTestappcode exe is actually located.p  pWhy does this happen, and how can I prevent it from happening I want to be able to run an application located in a different folder from the one where my calling application resides, and thus it is obviously important that the started process runs from the location where that process is located, and not where the calling application is located.p

Negative 19392 pHi I am making an app that streams video from android to pc. I have the streams setup correctly and am able to open the .sdp file containing my RTP stream information in VLC on any pc fine. I can get the video and audio stream and it works great. p  pI am also writing a java app for PC that will be able to view this stream using vlcj and do other operations between it and the android app. My problem is that this app for some reason is only functioning correctly on my pc in my college dorm room. The pcs in my computer science lab and at home over my home network give me Destination Unreachable Port Unreachable errors when viewing the traffic in wireshark. Keep in mind this only happens through my vlcj implementation, it works perfectly using the actual vlc client. It also works fine on my home pc, which should have the same setup as the one in my dorm.. p  pI have the following callback in my code for the MediaPlayer of vlcjp  precodeOverride public void bufferingMediaPlayer mediaPlayer, float newCache      System.out.printlnBuffering   newCache  codepre  pIn the working computer it prints 0.0, and then continues up to 100 where the video appears and plays. On the computers where it doesnt work it just says 0.0 and then stops...p  pI really cannot understand this issue since it uses the same dlls as the vlc client and the packets get through when using the normal vlc client. Could the jre Im using be denying udp packetsp  pWell I just got another computer to work with it... the only thing I can think of that would be different in the working computers is that they have actual video cards whereas the nonworking ones have integrated cards... But I dont think that would make a difference.p

Negative 19392 pFXML performance is an issue with JavaFX, if you have complex screens and have divided them into small components for maintainability  reuse that use FXML, then it can get really slow.p  pAs FXML parsing is made in UI Thread not sure of this, still it blocks the JavaFX Application Thread, you cannot show a glasspane  popup  etc in JavaFX when FXML is being processed.p  pThe only workaround I found is to use a Swing popup as it is in Swing UI Thread, you can still show something to provide a feedback to the user it is working  not a bug  wait a little more when FXML is being loaded and to close it when no more FXML files are parsed. p  pI have built a facade above FXMLLoader to do so. Also this also works with OpenGL libraries as well LWJGL for instance, instead of Swing, anything that is UI and is not in JavaFX Application Thread works.p  pI was wondering if a better solution exists JavaFX only, not mixing UI frameworks as this artificially adds complexity to the project and wont be ported well with OpenJFX ports.p

Negative 19392 pAt the moment I try to create a visual oddball task with a staircase procedure embedded in it using Psychopy v1.81.03, builder version. The odds should follow the staircase gabor patches that change orientation. Standards should be gabor patches oriented vertically. I started with creating a simple random trialloop. Within that loop I inserted code components looking like thisp  pFor the begin of the experiment I defined an orientation variable also referring to it in the interface, in which the properties of the gabor patch are defined and the staircasep  precode orient  20  staircase  data.StairHandlerstartVal  20.0,                   stepType  lin, stepSizes[8,4,4,2,2,1,1],                   maxVal  90, minVal  0, nUp1, nDown3, nTrials  50 codepre  pFor the begin of the routine I defined the presentation of the stimuli and an ifstatement that should choose the orientation depending on if it is a standard or an odd.p  precode ratio of oddball and standard oddORstand  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2][randint0,10]   choosing orientation and correct answer depending if its standard or odd  if oddORstand  1 standard     orient  0     corrAns  None else odd     for thisIncrement in staircase         orient  orient  thisIncrement         corrAns  space         break codepre  pFor the part that ends the routine I defined the response that should change the future orientation of odds depending on if it was a correct answer detection  spacebar pressed or notp  precodeif oddORstand  2 it was an odd     if keyrespstand.keys  space space bar pressed, correct answer         thisResp  1         staircase.addResponsethisResp     elif keyrespstand.keys  space space bar was not pressed, wrong answer         thisResp  0         staircase.addResponsethisResp     else         pass codepre  pIn general, this works somehow standards and odds are presented randomly and also the odds change their orientation but not in a manner that would make sense or that was intended.

Negative 19392 pFirst of all sorry to post a question that seems to have been flogged to death on SO before. However, none of the questions I have reviewed helped me to solve my specific problem.p  pI have built a web application that runs an extensive data processing routine in PHP i.e. MySQL queries, calculations, etc.. p  pDepending on the amount of data fed to the app this processing can take quite a long time so the script needs to run serverside and independently from the web frontend.p  pThere is a problem, however. It seems I cannot control the script execution time limit as long as the script is invoked via cgi. p  pWhen I run the script via SSH and the command line it works fine for however long it takes to process the data. p  pBut if I use the codeexeccode command in a php script called via the webserver I always ends up with the error codeEnd of script output before headerscode after approximately 45 seconds.p  pRather than having to fiddle with server settings a nightmare in terms of portability I would like to find a solution that kicks off the script independently from cgi.p  pAny suggestionsp

Negative 19392 pI would like to do some audio and video analysis in Java.br In a bit more detail, I would like to identify the points in audiovideo that have either been monotonous for quite some time or have drastically changed compared to some previous state.  p  pIf you want to look at it in a mathematical way, I can try to explain it like this  p  pExample  p  blockquote   pYou have an audio file.   You should extract the waveform of that   audio file.   You could try to approximate that waveform with some   simpler function, that can be expressed as a closed formula.   Lets   call that function codeftcode.p blockquote  pNow, to find out how your function behaves is it increasing or decreasing at some point or interval, I guess I could use the first derivative,codeftcode.  If Id like even more information, I assume second derivative, codeftcode would also come in handy.p  pSo, if we assume we can do that then I guess Id have 1 piece of information about the audio.  p  pHowever, if Im not mistaken, audio files can also have spectrograms, so Im unsure how they fall into all of this.p  pSo, the real question goes here strongIs there a way to do this in Java efficientlystrong Ive been doing some digging and Ive found a hrefhttpscode.google.compmusicg relnofollow titleMusicGMusicGa, however, the last update date is July 2012, which leads me to believe this may be abandoned.p  pThe second part refers to video files, but without their audio component.br This is where Ill have more questions, so Im just gonna go and shoot them.p  pstrongHow do you identify points of change in pace in videosstrong p  pHeres an example  p  blockquote   pImagine the video shows car drivers point of view while hes driving   on a long, straight road. Since the surroundings are mostly the same,   the pace could be described as not changing much. At one point, the   road begins to curve but the driver, due to him falling asleep is not   following the road that precisely, so the surroundings start to change   somewhat, and so does the pace. At the apex of that curve there is a   tree, which grows bigger and bigger as the car is approaching it.   Here, the POV and the pace is changing quite a lot, since the tree   is getting bigger and bigger. In the end, the car crashes into a tree,   all hell breaks loose, the car starts to roll uncontrollably, which   indicates a really intense pace.p blockquote  pIm assuming one way could be to do an image segmentation and somehow determine which portions of the frames are changing, and how big are those portions to try to determine pace, but Id like additional input. p  pstrongIf anyone has had prior experience doing any sort of related work in Java, what approaches did you explore andor usestrong One thing that immediately comes to my mind is a hrefhttpsgithub.combytedecojavacv relnofollow titleJavaCVJavaCVa, but as I said, with my limited experience, Im unsure what to actually try.p

Negative 19392 pI have a container div and inside this div is random content and a footer tag. The footer contains 2 spans with random text.

Negative 19392 pThis question is really intended to be answered by emAASMem gem developers.p  pIm using the emAASMem gem in my rails app models strongMongoidstrong. I know you automatically generate scopes for every defined state. For instance, having this...p  precodeclass Order   include MongoidDocument   include MongoidTimestamps   include AASM    field aasmstate    aasm do     state pending, initial gt true     state received      event receive do       transitions from gt pending, to gt received     end   end end codepre  p...would allow me to do emOrder.pendingem and emOrder.receivedem.p  pMy question is very simple, do you also generate scopes to get the complement of a given state. Something like emOrder.notpendingem to get the emOrdersem that have a status different than empendingem.p  pI know it is pretty easy to build my own scope to obtain that, like this...p  precodescope notpending, gt neaasmstate pending  codepre  p...but I wanna make sure that you dont define it, because if you do, Id rather use your scope than my own. p

Negative 19392 pCurrently I am creating a RESTful API for a mobile application.  The RESTful API has a number of end points that allow users to exchange personal information between each other.  I was testing how secure these endpoints were and quickly realized that if a third party managed to gain access to the API they could easily look up other users information by guessing their user id or using an automated script to collect a wide range of personal information.  This was due to the fact that I was using a primary key that was a simple autoincremented integer which made it predictable and easy to determine other users ids.  I immediately began looking for something that didnt follow a distinct pattern.  I came across UUIDs and decided to implement them with my existing rails app.p  pWas this a wise decision  I definitely see the upside to using UUIDs but upon further research I found that there were a number of negatives to this approach.  Many sources claim that using UUIDs will cause performance issues with large tables.  Are UUIDs right for my situationp  pMy second question is about implementing this in an existing Ruby on Rails application.  I made the switch to UUIDs by following this article a hrefhttprny.iorailspostgresql20130727useuuidsinrails4withpostgresql.html relnofollowhttprny.iorailspostgresql20130727useuuidsinrails4withpostgresql.htmla.  I ran into an issue with enabling the codeuuidosspcode extension.  I created a migration and put codeenableextension uuidosspcode inside the change function.  I then changed the existing migrations to support UUIDs as their primary key and ran coderake dbdrop dbcreate dbmigratecode to recreate the database with the edited migrations.  This failed with the error codePGUndefinedFunction ERROR  function uuidgeneratev4 does not existcode.  I quickly realized that this was because I had created the migration that enabled the codeuuidosspcode extension after the migrations that I had edited to use UUIDs.  When I changed the time stamp in the name of the migration to a date that preceded all migrations the codedbmigratecode command completed with no errors.  This felt very hack and defeated the purpose of having migrations.  What is the correct way of adding this extension via a migrationp  pstrongEdit in response to commentsstrongp  pSo a number of comments were made that suggested that I should just be properly authenticating users and checking their permissions before allowing them to view certain data.  I have user authentication built into my application but will better explain my situation and why I needed something more than autoincremented primary keys.p  pI have a number of users on this application and each user has the ability to create private and public contacts.  Public contacts are viewable by everyone using the mobile application.  Private contacts can only be viewed by the user who created them.  However, a user can share their private contacts with other users by showing other users with the mobile application a QR code that has the contacts ID encoded into it.  When the user decodes the contact ID a request is sent to the backend to notify the backend that the user is now an owner of that private contact.  This allows the second user to now receive updates from that private contact.  This is a large feature of my application.  The aim here is to force people to have to exchange these contacts in person and to disallow others from seeing these contacts unless this process has happened.  p  pImplementing this concept proved to be fairly tricky as all users could potentially share all private contacts with any other user on the system. I found this extremely hard to implement using permissions as which contacts a user can view is constantly changing.p  pOriginally I implemented this with autoincremented integers as my primary key for the contact IDs.  It worked but forced me to create a very insecure API endpoint that essentially would take a user ID and a private contact ID as parameters and would add that user as an owner of that contact. Because autoincremented IDs are so predictable a user with access to the API could essentially loop through a sequence of numbers calling the endpoint each time, pass the sequence number in as the contact ID and add themselves as owners to contacts that hadnt been shared with them.  This would by pass the whole process of having to share the contact in person and in large defeats the purpose of having my mobile application.p  pI decided I needed something less predictable, completely random and unique to each private contact.  I found UUIDs while doing research to solve this problem and changed the contact ID in my model to be of type UUID.  Are UUIDs the best way to solve this Should I use something else Have I gone about solving this problem the wrong way p
Negative 19392 pI am trying to roll my own MVC purely for learning purposes, but am hitting a snag when I try to load in the view files. Heres my problemp  pFront controller grabs appropriate page controller, page controller codeincludeoncecode the appropriate view. The view is a file containing HTML and PHP. When I return the include file from the controller, the included file content appear out of sequence of the PAGE layout intended. example I want to display HEADER CONTENT FOOTER, but when I include the views contents, my controller spits out CONTENT, HEADER, 1, FOOTER.p  pIn my front controller I am emattemptingem to set my included file contents to a variable I then echo in between my HEAD and FOOTER in the PAGE template.  But this does not work as intended. I can wrap my view file contents in return code but I dont want the added headache of worrying about stray quotesdouble quotes in my view code that could break the script.  I have tried codefilegetcontentscode, but this only spits out a string albeit in the right placesequence in my template and does not the PHP in my view files correctly ie at all.p  pMy question is Is there a way I can return my view file to my front controller using codeincludeoncecode in a variable I cant seem to find a adequate answer to this. Id be happy to add my code if it would help.p

Negative 19392 pI need some advice. We currently are struggling with the fact or its a good idea to add timezones to our dates in the database or not. We are using deals which can start and end the same day at a certain time. Someday we might wanna go worldwide, so its good to know for users from the us, on which local datetime the deal has to end...p  pSo first we just added timezones to our dates. But yesterday we found some problems. The website is stored on a Heroku server in Great Britain, and our database in Amsterdam. After executing some tasks and saving rows inside of the database, the website from Heroku sent English timestamps to the database and Postgres just added a 0100, without knowing from what timezone the sent timestamp was. So the timestamps contained an English timestamp with a Dutch timezone, so it was obviously incorrect.p  pWe did struggle already with the idea of using timezones or not. So now Im struggling even more. I do have the idea it might be a good one to determine the timezone of the user who loaded the websitep  precodevar offset  new Date.getTimezoneOffset codepre  pAnd send that offset with the timestamp to the database. Or... I could just translate the datetime to EuropeAmsterdam using our moment.js libraryp  pa hrefhttpmomentjs.comtimezone relnofollowhttpmomentjs.comtimezoneap  pWhat do you thinkp  pEDITp  pJust figured out that SequelizeJS which we use to connect to the database does has the ability to use timezones a hrefhttpssequelize.readthedocs.orgenlatestapisequelize relnofollowhttpssequelize.readthedocs.orgenlatestapisequelizea. But still, should it be a better idea to save timezones so we can determine which timezones does has the most users or whatever or without. What do you guys think.p

Negative 19392 pTLDR Im getting an EXCBADACCESS error using swift in XCode 6.1 building for iOS8.1.

I have the following classes that define a word with associated definitions, audio files, userinteraction statistics, etc. and a word list with an associated list of words and methods to addremove words to the list, alphabetize the list, etcp  precodeclass Word NSObject, NSCoding, Printable      var hangul  String     var definition  String      ...   class WordList NSObject, NSCoding      var title       var knownWords  DictionaryltString,Stringgt       ...      func addWordToListwordName String, wordDefinition String           Debug statements         printlnI am WordList self.title and have the following knownWords self.knownWords.count words total          for wordName,wordDefinition in self.knownWords              printlntwordName  wordDefinition                  printlnnI am about to attempt to add the word wordName with definition wordDefinition to the above dictionary           Add word to wordList, including the let fix          fixEXCBADACCESSbug         knownWords[wordName]  wordDefinition  EXCBADACCESS          func fixEXCBADACCESSbug           This empty line attempts to solve a excbadaccess compiler bug when adding a new value to a WordList dictionary         let newDic  self.knownWords           ...  codepre  pNext I have a UITableViewController with a UISearchBar that I use to display the dictionary again in the English sense of words to the user. The user adds words by tapping a button which is displaying an image on the right of each cell, which calls the emIBAction func addWordem in the viewControllerp  precodeclass AddingWordsToWordListTableViewController UITableViewController, UISearchResultsUpdating      var koreanDictionary  KoreanDictionary  Custom class with method getWordindex Int to return desired Word     var filteredSearch  [Word]              ...

I can add a new word list and start adding words to it, until I add the 8th word. I always on the 8th word get a EXCBADACCESS error in WordList emaddWordToListem with the following println informationp  precodeI am WordList School and have the following knownWords 7 words total    school vacation   graduate school   school year   high school student   elementary school   student   school  I am about to attempt to add the word  with definition college student to the above dictionary codepre  pNote that the order in which I add the words appears irrelevant i.e. the word college student can be added successfully if it is one of the first 7 words. There is nowhere in the code where I explicitly change behavior based on the number of words in a word list except to display the words in a word list as cells in a UITableView, or any dependencies that would to my knowledge make the 8th word a special number. And indeed this number can change by using the emlet hackem solution see below to a different number, but for a particular build is emalwaysem the same number. p  pAt this point Im at a complete loss of what to do. Im relatively new to swift and have spent quite a few hours looking up how to fix excbadaccess errors.

However, as is always the case it is highly likely Im missing something obvious, so please let me know if this is indeed true.p  pIf the error is caused by 3 above something else I have tried the followingp  pFrom a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions26809986excbadaccessonios81withdictionaryEXCBADACCESS on iOS 8.1 with Dictionarya and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions26787070excbadaccesswhenupdatingswiftdictionaryafterusingitforevaluatensexprEXCBADACCESS when updating Swift dictionary after using it for evaluate NSExpressiona solutionsp  ol liI have tried different variations of the emlet stupidHack em scenario, and it does sometimes change the results, but only the number of entries allowed before crashing i.e. I can sometimes get to the 15th16th entry in the dictionary before the error. I have not been able to find an actual, bugfree solution using this method, however.li liI have rebuilt using both Release and Debug modes the error appears in both. Note I am only using the simulator and do not have a developers license to try it on an actual device.li liI have turned off set to None compiler optimization it was already off for the Debug build anyway.li liI have tried building to iOS 8.0 with the same error results.li ol  pAny way to get around this issue is appreciated.

Negative 19392 pIn the Grails application Im developing, I have a set of domain classes that start with a single base class which is then extended through a hierarchy of inheriting subclasses and subsubclasses. Im perfectly content to use the tablePerHierarchy storage approach in fact Im obligated to do so, as Im using MongoDB for my database and it doesnt allow for tablePerSubclass, but I want to be able to search by class, including subclasses. This works fine for the base class, as all of its descendants will be stored in its table, and for the leaf classes, since they have no subclasses. It runs into trouble with intermediate classes in the hierarchy, though, as a query will return only objects of the intermediate class and not of its subclasses.p  pFor a simplified example of what Im talking about, suppose we have three classes, creatively named A, B, and C. B extends A, and C extends B.p  pA.list will return all objects of types A, B, and Cp  pB.list will return all objects of type B but fails to return objects of type C, even though they are just a more specific type of object Bp  pC.list will return all objects of type Cp  pI very much want these intermediate layers to be queryable in such a way that they also query subclasses at the same time.

Negative 19392 pI have an application that I am trying to build through the command line with MSBuild. My application is composed of a lot of projects with a lot of dependencies on each other. My question is that if there is a way to find DLLs dependent on a specific DLL. This requirement was due to the following issue.p  pSuppose I have a project BaseProject in my application which hosts a class Enum.cs for storing all the enums used system wide. Also there is another project called DependendentProject which has a class DependendentOnEnum.cs which uses one of the enum from Enum.cs.p  h2For Exampleh2  pEnum.cs has the following enump  precodepublic enum ClassTypeEnum                                 A,              DC,              MP,             FX,             CA,             CD          codepre  pAnd DependendentOnEnum uses this enum to validate and process data according to enum typep  precodevoid ValidateAndProcessDataint enumValue         ifenumValue  ClassTypeEnum.FX Line3                       ProcessData          codepre  pNow when the DLL of BaseProject and DependentProject. The ClassTypeEnum.FX in the above snippet is changed to 3.p  pIf now some other user comes along and changes the ClassTypeEnum to something like this, the issue arrisesp  precodepublic enum ClassTypeEnum                                         A,                  DC,                  MP,                 OI, Added OI at position 3                 FX,                 CA,                 CD              codepre  pNow what our patch builder does at the production machine is that it builds all the dll for projects that have changed. Now since here only the BaseProject has changed only its DLL is build. p  pDue to this, the DLL of DependendentProject now starts poniting to strongClassTypeEnum.OIstrong instead of strongClassTypeEnum.FXstrong. And the whole validation process fails.p  pI have tried using depends.exe but it only covers system dependencies. Also I want all those DLLs that are dependent on a strongspecificstrong DLL, which it does not provide.p  pI know building the whole solution again is an answer, but that would be an overkill since not all projects are regularly modified.p  pSo is there a way to build such a dependency structure Any tool or some code snippet that builds the structure.p

Negative 19392 pI have a problem that I cant figure out, and Ive searched everywhere.p  pI recently added Google Signin to my app, and its working fine on the main target, however, since Im using multiple targets to deploy a secondary version of my app, the second bundle identifier cant get added to GoogleServiceInfo.plist.  The Google signin code refers to this file by name, so I cant simply change the name for each version of the app like Ive done for other plists.p  pIve tried adding environment variables to each scheme and using BUNDLEID in the plist to change based on the chosen scheme, but its not working either.  Is there something Im missing  How should a workspace with multiple targets use the same plist with different variables for each targetp  pThanksp  pEdit  Tried using an XCConfig file to replace the static values in the plist with compiletime variables.  No luck, probably because I think Google Signin is accessing the file directly.  I assume anyone using Google Signin with an app that has multiple targets adsupported vs. paid premium must have a way around this.  Please help.p

Negative 19392 pAndroid already has the PCRE shared library systemliblibpcre.so, but its compiled without Unicode support, so Ive built my own version of PCRE for Android. My native code is linked to the PCRE shared library. However, when I run my app, it uses the systems version of PCRE, rather than the one Ive built, even though my APK does include my version of PCRE. How do I make it use my version of PCRE rather than the systems Generally in Linux I use LDLIBRARYPATH or RPATH, but on Android I dont know how to use them, if thats at all possible.p

Negative 19392 pI am converting a Wordpress website to Magento. One aspect of this switch is achieving a Video Intro into the website. Currently it utilizes a Wordpress plugin which loads a website a hrefhttpexample.comvideointro relnofollowhttpexample.comvideointroa before a hrefhttpexample.com relnofollowhttpexample.coma and after the video is finished playing the window is redirected to a hrefhttpexample.com relnofollowhttpexample.coma. p  pI have purchased the pure PHP version of this plugin documentation here a hrefhttpplugins.themestrike.comvideointro2documentationphp relnofollowhttpplugins.themestrike.comvideointro2documentationphpa, but it does not seem to work with Magento. I cannot figure out why. The page a hrefhttpexample.comvideointro relnofollowhttpexample.comvideointroa works great, the redirect works great, but I cannot get a hrefhttpexample.comvideointro relnofollowhttpexample.comvideointroa to come up before anything else. The plugin creator has responded as unable to provide any support for the script.p

Negative 19392 pIve read several times that passing STL objects like vector and string outside of a DLL boundary is bad practice because different compiler versions can generate different code for STL objects. Therefore, you should design a Cstyle interface and not pass STL objects at all. However, there are still some things unclear to mep  pstrong1. What is the boundary of a DLLstrongp  pIs it right to say, that the boundary is where code is beeing strongcompiledstrong on DLL side What if I define a .h file inside a DLL f.e. to write a factory class and use that header file in a different project Is that .h file inside or outside the boundary of the DLL and whyp  pstrong2.

Passing objects out of a DLLboundary using uniqueptrstrongp  pIm using uniqueptr almost everytime in my project.

Why does defining interfaces or using PIMPL help to define an DLL interfacestrongp  pI still have to convert my STL classes to Cstyle objects. And in the project using the DLL, I would have to somehow wrap the Cstyle objects inside STL classes again. I dont see any advantage of using interfaces or PIMPL in this case. Also, if I define an interface class with pure virtual functions, wouldnt this have the same effect as just declaring the functions in my class with declspecdllexportp  precodeclass IFoo  public     virtual IFoo  0      virtual void f1  0  class Foo  public IFoo  public     void f1     declspecdllexport void f1 why use an interface if I can just declare the functions like this  codepre  pHow is the DLLSTL problematic solved in modern C 1114 libraries Are there any modern opensource libraries that I can have a look atp
Negative 19392 pIts my first questionpost p  pstrongBackground to questionstrongp  pI have an ongoing project which is an Azure hosted ASP.NET solution. Its a generic ERP and is intended for small enterprise businesses. An additional requirement came up and Id like it to be part of the Azure solution previous attempt to create a VSTO addin went bad.p  pstrongIve been asked to automate this processstrong Users spend a long time daily basis manually saving emails into network shared directories according to what company project the emails relate to. E.g. everytime Sally sends or receives an email, she copies and renames the .msg file from outlook into her G drive which is just a network share on the enterprise LAN. Someone else in the enterprise has the job of creating a specific directory structure for sally and her coworkers to save the emails in e.g. CorrespondanceIn, CorrespondanceOut etc... Staff need to be able to search the directories for messages based on some scraped meta data.p  pIm considering an exchange web service managed API application in Azure which has a service that polls the Exchange Server for every user with a pull subscription to identify newchanged mails. Each identified mail will be then assessed against a rule that the user has pre registered in my application i.e. from person x with project ID in the subject field. The application will then rename the email and put it in the network share also scrape metadata to provide search functionality.p  pstrongQuestionstrongp  pa How do I get my remote application to request the Exchange Server or CAS to export the MailItem to a local network share using exchange web services in the most efficient way Preferably without having to deploy something into the enterprise.p  pb is this a ridiculous solutionp  pstrongAdditional Infostrongp  pI expect the typical environment to be quite old. However, I can assume Exchange Server 2007 and Outlook Clients 2007 on Win7 no Office365 though and no sharepoint. I decided to use a pull subscription as it will be a loosely coupled environment and therefore assumed streaming to be not the best fit.p  pMailItems are likely to contain large attachments CAD drawings etc so for obvious reasons, I would like to avoid pulling these across the WAN.p  pI have investigated the potential to create server side mailbox rules with EWS therefore allowing this exchange server to manage the export  however if I understand correctly, rules dont support exporting MailItems to the filesystem.p
