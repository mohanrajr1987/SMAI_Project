Positive 488 pI had two custom domains on my setup. Now one is not there, the domain in question, www.emlakair.com is still working and pointing to the app engine code, but missing from the developers console. The other domain is www.catchamove.com. This is working also and visible under custom domains. p  pI have not done anything with the custom domains since they have been working so no changes on my part there. However, I have recently setup an account on with Googles search console and both the same domains are listing on there. My domain settings remain unchanged since verification of the domain first time around and everything seems fine that end. p  pDoes anyone have a clue, I could try to reverify the missing domain but that will mean changing the CNAME record and that will take the domain down for a while. p  pHere is the CNAME record data a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comZxudA.jpg relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comZxudA.jpg altenter image description hereap  pCan anyone from Google or anyone else for that matter explain this or provide a solution.p  pThanksp
Positive 488 pIm studying JavaScript, and the book Im following suggests the easiest place to test code for exercises and exploring the concepts is on the browser console itself, so thats what Ive been doing. p  pHowever, a professional friend of mine told me to instead make an html page, link it to a js file and put the code I want to test there, inside an immediately invoked function. This way I could load and reload the page on the browser to see the output on the console. p  pI was confused about why the same piece of simple code would run or output differently if typed directly on the console versus if loaded from a file. p  pThen I came across this piece of code used to illustrate closure on loops on my material p  precodefor var i1 ilt5 i      setTimeoutfunction timer          console.logi      , i1000   codepre  pThe book says this code should output the number 6 five times, but when I typed it on the console Google Chrome the output was a code5code, then five code6codes one per second. p  pRemembering what my friend said, I followed his suggestion and, indeed, strongthe same code, when executed from a js file linked to an html, outputs differentlystrong, resulting in the number code6code five times. p  pExactly why does this happen Is it a difference on the engine Does the compilation happen differently for some reason p  pI have no idea whats at play here. My friend didnt have time or knowledge to explain, and the book never touches on this subject.p

Positive 488 pso Im making a game that uses nothing but the console in my java IDE, but I have a problem using delays. My goal is to create a method that when taken a text passed though the parameters, it prints it letter by letter with a delay of 50. Kind of like the text in the Pokemon series, how it scrolls though each letter.p  pThe problem I have is lag. Im running an amd fx8350 cpu 4GHz, 4 cores4 virtual cores. Whenever I change the delay amount to anything around and under 100 milliseconds, the console prints half a word, then a little bit of the other half, then half the sentence, then maybe a character, etc.p  pIve tried this code here it works, but with lagp  precodepublic void scrollString text     int delay  50     ActionListener action  new ActionListener              int counter  text.length         Override         public void actionPerformedActionEvent event                      ifcounter  0                              timer.stop                          else                              System.out.printtext.substringtext.length  counter, text.length  counter  1                 counter                                timer  new Timerdelay, action     timer.start  end scroll codepre  pAnd this code as well also works, with same amount of lagp  precodepublic void scrollString text     forint i  0 i lt text.length i        try                 Thread.sleep1000             catchInterruptedException ex                Thread.currentThread.interrupt                     System.out.printtext.substringi, i  1      end scroll codepre  pIn conclusion, Im guessing that the computer is doing more than delaying when I try to delay the thread. Any ideasp  pThanks, Ericp

Positive 488 pI use a simple jquery command in the Google Chrome console to manage my site. Basically, I have to approve a number of new requests every day, so I usep  precode.approve.click codepre  pwhere approve is the class name of the button that needs to get clicked. This saves me hours. However, this crashes my browser every time, and sometimes doesnt work, mainly because of the resource taxing it put on my laptop. I was looking for a way to slow down the actions of the function. I tried... p  precode.approve.click.delay1000 codepre  pto try and slow it down by 1 second between button clicks. This didnt seem to work it ran without errors but I dont think it slowed down the clicking. p  pAny ideasp  pEditp  pSomeone pointed out that this may be a duplicate of another question. The reason it isnt is that the other top answer focuses on using JS to define a function that uses setTimeout, where I am looking for a native jquery method of doing it. I understand jquery is written in JS, but because Im using it in a command console, I dont have the luxury of multiple lines of coding space.p  pCan anyone also tell me why the above function wouldnt work It seems like it should, based on my research.p  pThank you in advance.p

The program must correctly handle errors division by zero, entering the number instead of  arithmetic operators, etc. and notify the user, without interrupting the work.p  pThis is what Ive got so farp  precodeConsole.WriteLine  x             double x  Convert.ToDoubleConsole.ReadLine       while true             Console.WriteLine  y             double y  Convert.ToDoubleConsole.ReadLine             Console.WriteLine                Console.WriteLine               Console.WriteLine               Console.WriteLine               Console.WriteLine               string z  Console.ReadLine                 switch z                                      case                          Console.WriteLine                           Console.WriteLinex  y                         break                     case                          Console.WriteLine                           Console.WriteLinex  y                         break                     case                          Console.WriteLine                           Console.WriteLinex  y                         break                     case                          if y  0                                                      Console.WriteLine   0                                                  else                                                      Console.WriteLine                               Console.WriteLinex  y                                                  break                  codepre  pp  pIve successfully added division by zero restriction, but thats about all.

Positive 488 pHi this is my first post here,p  pwhen i am using for example the MYSQL command line tool with a simple query like select  from table, i obviously get the table content printed to the command line. If i am missspelling the query i obviously get a MYSQL error printed.p  pNow, i was wondering if there is any way i can get these kind of outputs from the command line, when i am executing a query via JDBC, and put them in string.p  pMy goal is to implement two textfields in a Java GUI, one as input for executing a MYSQL query, one for displaying the output that i would get if i were using the command line tool. It is basically a command line tool implemented in Java.p  pI looked thoroughly via google but couldnt find anything. I wasnt too shure what exactly to look for anyway. How do you call the output of the command line tool I tried trace, stacktrace but i wasnt surep  pThank you very much in advance.p

Negative 488 pI want to be better at using NUnit for testing the applications I write, but I often find that the unit tests I write have a direct link to the environment or underlying database on the development machine instead.p  pLet me make an example.p  pIm writing a class which has the single responsibility of retriving a string, which has been stored in the registry by another application. The key is stored in HKCUSoftwareCustomApplicationIniPath.p  pThe Test I end up writing looks like thisp  precode[Test] public void GetIniDir      RegistryReader r  new RegistryReader     Assert.AreEqualCProgramfilesCustomApplicationSomeDir, r.IniDir  codepre  pBut the problem here is that the string CProgramfilesCustomApplicationSomeDir is really just correct right now. Tomorrow it might have changed to CAnotherdirSomeDir, and suddenly that breaks my unit tests, even though the code hasnt changed.p  pThis problem is also seen when I create a class which does CRUD operations against a database. The data in the database can change all the time, and this in turn makes the tests fail. So even if my class does what it is intended to do it will fail because the database returns more customers that it had when I originally wrote the test.p  precode[Test] public void GetAllCustomersCount      DAL d  new DAL     Assert.AreEqual249, d.GetCustomerCount  codepre  pDo you guys have any tips on writing Tests which do not rely on the surrounding environment as muchp
Negative 488 pFirst off Im a COMPLETE newbie at Cocoa, so please bare with me for asking what I am sure is an inane and utter newbish question. p  pMy situation is as follows I want to expand on the functionality of NSTextField.

I have purchased the book recommended here and many other places. Some sort of Bible I gather and Im looking into it as we speak in the few silent hours I have these days.  p  pBut although I can see its going to be an indispensable tool for me I still gain the most understanding from studying examples rather than reading the theory and so I would be extremely grateful if someone would create a project with a proper subclass of the relevant class since I understand that I should probably not be extending the NSTextfield classp  pI would instantly mark Mark Thalmans post as the answer as Im sure its a proper for dummies response, but Ill hold out for a few days since Id really love a file to peruse. But I am not ungrateful p  pOh, and Please believe me guys when I say Im not quite as useless in languages I actually know.

Negative 488 pIm suffering a lot to create a simple ChatServer in Java, using the NIO libraries. Wonder if someone could help me. I am doing that by using SocketChannel and Selector to handle multiple clients in a single thread. The problem is I am able to accept new connections and get its data, but when I try to send data back, the SocketChannel simply doesnt work. In the method write, it returns a integer that is the same size of the data im passing to it, but the client never receives that data. Strangely, when I close the server application, the client receives the data. Its like the socketchannel maintains a buffer, and it only get flushed when I close the application.p  pHere are some more details, to give you more information to help. Im handling the events in this piece of codep  precodeprivate void run throws IOException   ServerSocketChannel ssc  ServerSocketChannel.open   Set it to nonblocking, so we can use select ssc.configureBlocking false    Get the Socket connected to this channel, and bind it  to the listening port this.serverSocket  ssc.socket InetSocketAddress isa  new InetSocketAddress this.port  serverSocket.bind isa    Create a new Selector for selecting this.masterSelector  Selector.open   Register the ServerSocketChannel, so we can  listen for incoming connections ssc.register masterSelector, SelectionKey.OPACCEPT   while true   See if weve had any activity  either  an incoming connection, or incoming data on an  existing connection int num  masterSelector.select   If we dont have any activity, loop around and wait  again if num  0  continue    Get the keys corresponding to the activity  that has been detected, and process them  one by one Set keys  masterSelector.selectedKeys Iterator it  keys.iterator while it.hasNext   Get a key representing one of bits of IO  activity SelectionKey key  SelectionKeyit.next   What kind of activity is it if key.readyOps amp SelectionKey.OPACCEPT  SelectionKey.OPACCEPT    Aceita a conexo Socket s  serverSocket.accept  System.out.println LOG Conexao TCP aceita de   s.getInetAddress    s.getPort    Make sure to make it nonblocking, so we can  use a selector on it.

So, a client makes a TCP connection to the server, and once it gets accepted, it sends data to the server following a simply text protocol, informing his id and asking to get registrated to the server. I handle this in the method  processIncomingDataFromNewClientkey. Im also keeping a map of clients and its connections in a data structure similar to a hashtable. I doing that because I need to recover a client Id from a connection and a connection from a client Id. This is can be shown in clientsMap.getClientkey.  But the problem itself resides in the method processIncomingDataFromNewClientkey. There, I simply read the data that the client sent to me, validate it, and if its ok, I send a message back to the client to tell that it is connected to the chat server. Here is a similar piece of codep  precodeprivate boolean processIncomingDataFromNewClientSelectionKey key SocketChannel sc  SocketChannel key.channel String connectionOrigin  sc.socket.getInetAddress    sc.socket.getPort  int id  0 id of the client  buf.clear int bytesRead  0 try  bytesRead  sc.readbuf ifbytesReadlt0 System.out.printlnConexo fechada pelo   connectionOrigin return false  System.out.printlnLOG   bytesRead   bytes lidos de   connectionOrigin  String msg  new Stringbuf.array,0,bytesRead   Do validations with the client sent me here  gets the client id  catch Exception e  e.printStackTrace System.out.printlnLOG Oops.

I added a new column in this table and I need to fill a value for every row in the column, using the corresponding row value of another column in this table.p  pI tried to use separate transactions for selecting every next chunk of 100 records and update the value for them, but still this takes hours to update all records in Oracle10 for example.p  pWhat is the most efficient way to do this in SQL, without using some dialectspecific features, so it works everywhere Oracle, MSSQL, MySQL, PostGre etc.p  pADDITIONAL INFO There are no calculated fields. There are indexes. Used generated SQL statements which update the table row by row.p

This app works just fine on any machine that isnt running Windows 7, but on those machines we get an error that the settings file cant be created because the user doesnt have permission.

Negative 488 p80 of the code I write is in C. The other 20 is in C. Whenever I have to switch from C to C, it takes me quite a while to mentally shift gears to thinking in C.

Negative 488 pI have a Python CGI script from which I am trying to call a Java program to perform a task. The Java program uses a hrefhttpwww.andykhan.comjexcelapi relnofollowJExcelAPIa. When I run the Python script from the browser, it fails with error messages that it cant find the class definitions for the classes from JExcelAPI. I suppose this happens because the Python CGI script is run under the apache user, and the apache user does not have the appropriate environment variables set namely the CLASSPATH variable. I have tried calling the program with the codeclasspath pathtoJExcelAPIcode switch, but that does not work either. Can you help me find the way to make the apache user aware of the JExcelAPI Is there a way to set the CLASSPATH environment variable for the apache userp  pThanksp

Negative 488 pIs it possible to override the seed value when creating a new table using the designer in  visual studio p  pI know it does not really matter from a programmatic point of view, but I dont like when IDs start at 1. I dont want to see customer ID of 1 or a sales order of 3  I prefer them to all be the same length  i.e. 4 or 5 or 6 digits long, so depending on the estimate size of the data I always use 1,000, 10,000 or 100,000 as the starting seed value.p  pI know I can do it in SQL management studio, but even when I do set the seed to 1,000 or 10,000, if I refresh the EDMX from the database it reverts back to IDENTITY1,1 and I dont want to have to do this for dozens of tables everytime I recreate the model.

Negative 488 pI was wondering what the best practices were for building and storing IDs. A few years ago, a professor told me about the dangers of a poorly constructed ID system, using the Social Security Number as an example. In particular, because SSNs do not have any error detection... it is impossible to tell the difference between a 9digit string and a valid SSN. And now government agencies need things like Last Name  SSN or Birthday  SSN to keep track of your data and ensure its verification. Plus, your Social Security number is somewhat predictable based on where you were born.p  pNow Im building a User database... and based off of this advice userid mediumint autoincrement would be unacceptable. Especially if I plan to use this ID as the primary identification for the user. for example, if I allow the users to change their username, then the username would be more difficult to keep track than the numerical userid... requiring cascading foreign keys and whatnot. Emails change, usernames can change, passwords change... but a userid should remain constant forever.p  pClearly, autoincrement is only designed for surrogatekeys. That is, its a useful shortcut only when you already have a primary identification mechanism, but it shouldnt be used as an innate identifier for the data. Creating random UUID looks interesting, but the randomness turns me off.p  pAnd so I ask whats the best practices for creating a primary key identification numberp

Negative 488 pSometimes when I am working on a projects layout in Eclipse I hit the run button while the active thing on the screen is still the layout.xml file. This causes eclipse to try to run just the xml file instead of the actual android project. I know that when I do this I can fix it by just deleting the xml.out file that gets created and cleanbuild on my project. However I remember using Eclipse at some point in the past when it didnt do this, if I hit run while working with an xml it still ran the Android project, just as if I had clicked run while editing a java file. My question is does anyone know if there is some sort of setting I can modify that will change the behavior back to that so that I dont have to switch back and forth to a java file just to run while I am actually doing work on the layout.p  pEdit That works but now I cant launch any other applications that I am working on without resetting that preference. Is there perhaps a way to make it treat xml files as though they are not launchable so that it will go down to option that I select for what to do if active resource is not launchable Because the Launch the associated project option thats under that seems like exactly what I want it to do when I try to launch an xml file.p

Negative 488 pI have an app with a navigation controller as the root view. There are many views that can be pushed in. The user has to create an account to use the app. The user can then log into this account from other devices, but only one device can be logged onto the same account at a time. So if multiple devices try to log into an account, only the latest device will be logged in and the other devices are logged off a push is sent to the devices.p  pSince there are multiple views that the device could be showing before it was logged off, I call popToRootViewControllerAnimated to get back to the root view. This is because when the user logs in the next time I only want the root view to be shown the new account might not have access to the previously shown view.p  pIf the user has an alert view or action sheet presented which uses the current view as its delegate before the push is received, the view will still be shown after the popToRootViewControllerAnimate method is called. If the user then taps on a button for the alert view or action sheet, it will send a message to the deallocd view and crash the app.p  pAn example myViewController is being shown to the user. myViewController create an action sheet prompting the user for a decision. The push is received for the device to log out. The navigation controller pops all the views controllers and now shows myRootViewController. Since the view controllers are popped, myViewController is now deallocd. The action sheet from myViewController is still shown. When the user selects an option form the action sheet, a message is sent to myViewController, and since it is already deallocd, a crash will occur.p  pIs there any way to prevent thisp  pOne solution I have considered would be to keep track of all the objects that uses a specific view controller as its delegate. Then when that view controller deallocs it will also set all the objects delegates to nil. This requires me to manually take care of every view controller when they create an object that uses itself as the delegate, since I cannot think of a way to automatically create and update this list.p  pAny better solution or improvement to mine would be appreciatedp  pstrongEditstrong The alert view and action sheet are only examples of some objects that I would use myViewController as a delegate. I am also using a number of other classes and thirdparty libraries that implements this delegate pattern.p

Negative 488 pIm trying to implement a service that asynchronously performs polling via a thread and then notifies a list of observers.p  pThe architecture is as follows multiple concurrent strongjsf session beansstrong can register to the singleton service and be notified by the thread in case of new data updates available. When notified, each jsf session bean performs some actions, by accessing to other strongsessionscoped spring beansstrong which are services defined in the context.xml.p  pThe problem Im facing now is that the update thread cannot access those sessionscoped spring beans, because their proxy cannot be resolved from the update thread, which is understandable since the thread is instantiated outside the application context and has no visibility on the available beans. But then, how can I implement such a mechanism in Springp  pI also tried using a task executor bean, hoping for Spring to make it somehow part of the current context, but it failed the sessionscoped spring beans called by the notified jsf session beans cannot be resolved. p  pAny help would be much appreciated. Thank you.p  pEDIT Added some more information about the communication flow.p  pEverytime a new user generates a new session, a corresponding jsf session bean is created. This bean once it is bound to the http session is then registered to a spring service a singleton. This service will activate the polling mechanism when at least one jsf session bean is registered therefore when theres at least one observer. When the service finds out a new update is available, it will notify the registered observers, by calling their update method. Inside this method each observer or jsf session bean will perform some actions via some other spring session beans, which are available as proxies. This is the point where communication fails, because the original polling thread the one in the update service doesnt know how to resolve the spring proxies. Is there a way to make this information available to the polling thread Thanks.p

Negative 488 pDoes anyone know of a browser plugin or application that will save form values then populate the same form when requiredp  pLet me explain what I mean. Im currently working on the registration page of a web application. As you can imagine its quite long and I have to keep filling it out. I can fill it out reasonably quickly using values already entered by tabbing through the fields and hitting the down arrow. But, its not fast enough Ideally Id like to enter the form values, then somehow save all the values under a name. E.g. Valid registration. When I come back to the page Id like to select my saved Valid registration form values and have the whole form populated automatically.p  pIve tried things like a hrefhttpsaddons.mozilla.orgenUSfirefoxaddonwebdeveloper relnofollowWeb Developera but they are no good, they dont populate a form with valid data.p  pEDITp  pIve also looked at a hrefhttpsaddons.mozilla.orgenUSfirefoxaddonautofillforms relnofollowautofill formsa which is better, but still requires a lot of set up for a long form containing non standard fields.p

Negative 488 pHeres a concrete example of what I am attempting to do with the Telerik GridView control. Lets say I have an application that will read a delimited file say CSV which will have n columns. The value n can vary from filetofile but is constant within a file. The application starts with an empty grid and adds columns as required to match the input file. The grid displays all data as strings in all cells. This works with either binding to a BindingList or putting the record objects into the GridView.Items list.p  pNow, what I want to do is put a single row at the top of the grid a row that will not scroll that contains comboboxes. That is, at the top of each column, the first row contains a combobox. On the first pass, the combobox will only be a drop list, but on the next pass I will add another row with a set of comboboxes that will be editable. For now, lets only consider drop lists.p  pThe specific problem that I have is that I do not see how to set a specific type of control for a particular cell. Telerik provides a GridViewComboBoxColumn class that will define the behavior for an entire column but thats not what I need.p  pBecause of the variable number of columns, I think that the codebehind would be the place to work this magic. I may have to do something in the xaml but, since Ive only been in WPF for a few months, nothing is jumping out at me.p  pIve done something like this with the DataGridView and XtraGrid, but this one has me stumped. Pointers would be much appreciated.p  hr  pIn response to Jonathan Ds answer, I have taken the provided code and modified it to recognize when a cell on the 0th row is being edited. When this is the case, a drop list is presented when the user initiates an edit operation.p  precodeusing Telerik.Windows.Controls using Telerik.Windows.Controls.GridView using System using System.Collections.Generic using System.Linq using System.Text using System.Windows using System.Windows.Controls using System.Windows.Data  namespace LLamasoft.DataGuru.Plugin.Internal.ConfigurationUI      public class RadGridViewComboboxHeaderColumn  GridViewBoundColumnBase              public static readonly DependencyProperty SelectedStringProperty              DependencyProperty.RegisterSelectedString, typeofstring, typeofRadGridViewComboboxHeaderColumn, new PropertyMetadatanull          public string SelectedString                      get  return string GetValueSelectedStringProperty              set  SetValueSelectedStringProperty, value                    public override FrameworkElement CreateCellEditElementGridViewCell cell, object dataItem                       we need the row on which this cell lives             GridViewDataControl gridViewDataControl  cell.ParentRow.GridViewDataControl             object currentEditItem  gridViewDataControl.Items.CurrentEditItem             int index  gridViewDataControl.Items.IndexOfcurrentEditItem              FrameworkElement frameworkElement  null             if index  0                              BindingTarget  ComboBox.SelectedValueProperty                 ComboBox comboBox  new ComboBox                  seed some values,                  this list should be set right after construction if static, otherwise via callback if dynamic                 comboBox.Items.Addstring.Empty                 comboBox.Items.Addapples                 comboBox.Items.Addoranges                 if comboBox.Items.Containscell.Value                                      comboBox.Items.Addcell.Value                                  comboBox.SelectedValue  SelectedString                 frameworkElement  comboBox                          else                              BindingTarget  TextBox.TextProperty                 TextBox textBox  new TextBox                 textBox.Text  SelectedString                 frameworkElement  textBox                           frameworkElement.SetBindingBindingTarget, CreateValueBinding              return frameworkElement                   public override object GetNewValueFromEditorobject editor                       ensure that the control will return the correct value when queried for it             ComboBox comboBox  editor as ComboBox             if comboBox  null                               bound to comboBox.SelectedValue which carries the correct value                          TextBox textBox  editor as TextBox             if textBox  null                               bound to textBox.Text which carries the correct value                           return base.GetNewValueFromEditoreditor                   private Binding CreateValueBinding               Binding valueBinding  new Binding         valueBinding.Mode  BindingMode.TwoWay         valueBinding.NotifyOnValidationError  true         valueBinding.ValidatesOnExceptions  true         valueBinding.UpdateSourceTrigger  UpdateSourceTrigger.Explicit         valueBinding.Path  new PropertyPaththis.DataMemberBinding.Path.Path          return valueBinding       codepre  pp  pThe good news is that this shows that any edit control can be used in any cell based on requirements.p  pThe bad parts are 1 a dummy record has to be inserted at the 0th list position and must be maintained there, 2 the data is being stored back into the field on the 0th record and may require a different data type than is on the equivalent fields on the other records, and 3 the combobox is only shown when the cell is in the edit mode.p  pThe latter issue for me may not be an issue elsewhere. I want a visual cue that the user is expected to interact with the cells at the top of the columns. Using this method, there is no differentiating factor between the top row and the rest of the rows until the edit operation begins. My ideal solution would have the cells always show their comboboxes.p  pOne other issue that I find difficult to believe that I am facing is the fact that I cannot easily pinfreeze topmost rows. I want this line to always remain at the top after scrolling. There is no grid.Rows[0].IsPinned  true functionality.p  pTelerik has responded to my request for info and suggests that I use a template selector to determine how the cell is represented. httpwww.telerik.comcommunityforumswpfgridviewneedjustfirstrowingridtobeallcomboboxes.aspx1820310. At this point, I turn my attention to testing that method.p

Negative 488 pExperiencing a weird problem in a modified program written by me. In my first iteration, the view controller had an IBAction by the title userSpecifyingInput and had all my buttons wired up to this IBAction.  To make the design more sophisticated, I introduced userSpecifyingDigit and userSpecifyingLetter and accordingly had some buttons wiring up to the first IBAction userSpecifyingDigit and the next button wiring up to the second IBAction userSpecifyingLetter. Upon running my program, it gave me this errorp  pterminating app NSInvalidArgumentException  Unrecognized selector sent to instance p  pAnd these selectors were alternating between userSpecifyingInput and userSpecifyingDigit which did not make sense as userSpecifyingInput was completely removed from my ViewControllers interface and implementations. p  pNow I am not sure why userSpecifyingInput still existed, but after dabbling with sent events, I noticed that the buttons were wired upto the new selectors as well as the old selector.  I had to manually remove the old selector from the touchupinside events for all the buttons. p  pNaturally this does not seem to be a very convenient way to go about proceedings and if the view controller selectors are modified then the touch events ought to be automatically removed.p  pAm I missing something here This is a pretty open ended question with different answersp

Negative 488 pi have already asked a similar question on stackoverflow, but its not the same  I have three problems with my codep  ol liThe framerate is not steady.

Negative 488 pIve converted a bunch of DML INSERTUPDATEDELETE queries from Oracle into PostgreSQL and now I need to check whether they produce the same set of rows, i.e. that delete removes the same rows, assuming the oracle and postgresql databases contain the same data initially, update updates the same rows etc. On PostgreSQL side, I can use the returning clause with DML statements, i.e.p  precodeINSERT INTO testid, name VALUES42, foo RETURNING  codepre  pWhats good about the statement above is that I can prepend returning  to any DML statement without knowing the structure or even the name of the table its executed against and just get all rows like its a select statement.p  pHowever, it seems to be not that shiny on the Oracle side. According to the documentation, Oracle 8i the one Im working with supports RETURNING clause, but it has to store the result into variables and there seem to be no obvious way to get all result columns instead of manually specifying the column name.p  pHence, the question is if there is an oracle statement or sequence of statements to emulate PostgreSQL returning  without hardcoding table or column names. In other words, is there a way to write an Oracle function like thisp  precodefnINSERT INTO testid, name VALUES42, foo  codepre  pIt should return the set of rows inserted or modified in the generic case by the SQL statement.p  pUpdate I actually found a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1074843isthereanoracleequivalenttosqlserversoutputinserteda very similar questiona for the conversion from SQL server, not PostgreSQL, into Oracle. Still, Id love to hear a more simple answer to that if possible.p

Negative 488 pIve taken over a wordpress ecomm although this question is more about profiling generally site which has a performance issue which seemingly only affects one specific area in the admin section of the CMS. When trying to edit one particular type of product, which has a large number of attributes attached to it, the page effectively causes the browser to crash 99 of the time. I expected this to be down to MySQL queries causing the bottleneck, however when I profiled the db, I got the following resultsp  pTotal Queries 174  Total Time Of MySQL Queries 0.11370p  pThis suggests the bottleneck is happening elsewhere, but Im not sure where it could be. If I run YSlow on the page, there is nothing drastic there which would explain the issue, although there are around 20 scripts and stylesheets loaded, so some optimisation could be done there. Im going to enable an opcode cache library which will improve PHP performance, but is there anything else I can do to try to identify the issue here Thanks.p

The key will be a numerical incrementing number such as 1,2,3,4 so it makes it a bit easier to keep track of the highest number, as the key can thus be incrementeddecremented, avoiding the need to sort the datastructure.strongp  pcodeMy one plan is to use a Dictionary as the buffer, which makes for a simple solutioncodep  pcodeMy other solution uses a set up two queuescodep  pcodeSuggestion by zmbg to use SortedList  I am concerned about performance, as hashing would provide faster lookup and insert notcodep  pstrongMy questions arestrongp  ul liBasically Im looking for pitfalls in terms of memory or performance using a dictionary for this solution. The machine that will run it doesnt have too much memory, but throughput performance has a slightly higher priority.li liIf this application is running all day, would there be any memory related issues when using the dictionaryli liDoes anyone have any thoughts on this or alternative implementation of this procedure. I have  to decide on a design, but I cannot test different solutions for performance as I dont quite have enough time, so I thought Id try a theoretical gathering of ideas and merit of implementation ideas before I start.li ul

Negative 488 pI am just beginning to learn VHDL in modelsim, so i apologize in advance if what Im doing seems really noob.p  pBasically what i am trying to create is a synthesizable VHDL code for a onedigit updown BCD counter. The  counter will count when Enable is 1, or else it stays the same. When input Init is initialized, the counter is set to 0 or 9 depending on the value of Direction input. When Direction is 1, it is an up counter.p  pIm just wondering if there are better tools to use for this to work other than using 100 if and else in a row.p  pHere is my code, I am writing a test bench for it right now, so I am not yet sure if this will even work.

Negative 488 pTake a look at a hrefhttpswww.drlaura.comsitememberlogin relnofollowthis login pagea, specifically, the form in the section labeled Returning Members. As you can verify by looking at the HTML or by digging with a tool such as Firebug, the actual form contains four  tags one each for the email address and password, an invisible input called memberAlready that contains the value yes, and a submit button in the form an image. So far, perfectly generic.p  pHowever, if you inspect the form data at the point at which the form is submitted using a hrefhttpsaddons.mozilla.orgenUSfirefoxaddontamperdata relnofollowTamper Dataa or its equivalent on another browser, youll see that two additional form fields have been sneaked into the response ACTIONloginCheckout.x and ACTIONloginCheckout.y. p  pThey both have twodigit integer values, which suggests that theyre only there to verify that the submitter is an actual web browser and not a robot. Presumably, they are related somehow to the submit button, which is defined as followsp  precodeltinput typeimage nameACTIONloginCheckout valueLogin srcimagesloginlogin.gifgt codepre  pWhats confusing to me is that these extra form fields appear strongeven when JavaScript is disabled in the browserstrong. So they presumably arent just something inserted by an event handler somewhere. p  pFurthermore, if you submit the form programmatically e.g., by running document.forms[1].submit in the JavaScript console, the extra fields strongare notstrong generated and the login attempt fails. That suggests to me that the insertion of the fields depends on something outside the basic HTML form submission mechanism. But what that thing could be if its not JavaScript, I dont know.p  pDoes anyone recognize this pattern or have a theory as to how the validation fields are insertedp

Negative 488 pIm writing a reusable Javascript snippet jQuery plugin that involves DOM CSS styling. Since its supposed to be usable by anyone, Id like to avoid conflicts between its CSS classes names and other existing classes on a document. Thats why Im using a namespace string as a prefix for all of its class names e.g. class codegridcode becomes codeprfxgridcode if my prefix is codeprfxcode. To respect DRY, and have it easily changeable, Id like to declare my prefix only once, and access it from both the CSS spreadsheet possibly using Sass and the Javascript code. If possible, Id also like to go on with only 2 files my .js and my .css.p  pIs there a way to declare such a prefixnamespace constant so it can be accessed from both SCSS and Javascript p

Negative 488 pOne of my work is deploying war files in the tomcat server and Im doing this for years. The way I deploy is stop tomcat, copy the war to the newly created directory which I set as an codeappbasecode in the tomcat virtual hosting and start the tomcat to extract the war under appbase, and finally stop tomcat, move extracted directory from appbase to webapps and start the tomcat finally. This procedure is strictly recommended by our developers as they were complaining because they used to get some mails if I directly place the war under webapps due to multiple auto deploys. This way its fine for us and never faced any problem on the production server.p  pMy question is,p  pIs the manual extraction with the command line codemkdir myappcd myappjar xf pathmyapp.warcode and the way the tomcat extracts same. I want to write a script, Could there be any problem if I manually extract the war file with codejarcode command and place it in the webapps and start the tomcat instead of letting tomcat unpack the war. Does it work, is it recommended for production server or does it make any difference the way the tomcat extracts if it does any thing mysteriously which jar couldnt.p  pNeed help, Thank youp

Negative 488 pIve built a JQuery Mobile based app, wrapped in AppMobi, released for both iOS and Android. To date Ive heard of no major issues. Today I heard that a user with Android ICS is having repeatable crashes when accessing any drop down select boxes  I cannot reproduce the problem with my older test unit. Ive had them try my raw html site as well  which does not yield the same behaviour, but the AppMobi guys seem to take a dim view on the use of JQuery Mobile so dont anticipate much help from that quarter.p  pMy main alternative is likely going to be replacing the standard select drop down select boxes with some alternative.p  pCan anyone suggest an alternative the simpler the better that will yield the same functionality as the below codep  precodeltselect idpunitsgt     ltoption valueinH2Ogtin H2Oltoptiongt     ltoption valueinHGgtin Hgltoptiongt     ltoption valuepsigtpsiltoptiongt     ltoption valuecmH2Ogtcm H2Oltoptiongt     ltoption valuecmHGgtcm Hgltoptiongt     ltoption valuekPagtkPaltoptiongt   ltselectgt codepre  pThanking you in advancep
Negative 488 pI have a design issue that I am having a hard time solving.  I have a web page that displays some graphical data in tables and prompts the user to annotate the data via DropDownLists in some of the table cells.  Once the input is selected, the selection replaces the DropDownList so that it can only be edited once.  I want one person to be able to edit this page and all other viewers to see only the finished product.  If another viewer loads the page before it has been edited I want them to see an empty table with, perhaps, a message saying that the table is not ready.p  pIm new to web programming and I am having a hard time coming up with a solution to this requirement.  I can store the table edits in an XML file and load them for the nonediting viewers.  One thing though is how to tell the users apart.p  pAny advice is appreciated.p  pRegards.p

Negative 488 pI read of a useful trick about how you can avoid using the wrong domain data in your code by creating a data type for each domain type youre using. By doing this the compiler will prevent you from accidentally mixing your types.p  pFor example, defining thesep  precodepublic struct Meter      public int Value      public Meterint value              this.Value  value        public struct Second      public int Value      public Secondint value              this.Value  value       codepre  pallows me to not mix up meters and seconds because theyre separate data types. This is great and I can see how useful it can be. Im aware youd still need to define operator overloads to handle any kind of arithmetic with these types, but Im leaving that out for simplicity.p  pThe problem Im having with this approach is that in order to use these types I need to use the full constructor every time, like thisp  precodeMeter distance  new Meter5 codepre  pIs there any way in C I can use the same mode of construction that a codeSystem.Int32code uses, like thisp  precodeMeter distance  5 codepre  pI tried creating an implicit conversion but it seems this would need to be part of the Int32 type, not my custom types. I cant add an Extension Method to Int32 because it would need to be static, so is there any way to do thisp
Negative 488 pIn versions of PHP prior to 5.4 I used static classes to instantiate an object and immediately call the required function, for examplep  precoderesult  Fooinitgtbar codepre  pIn the above example, the static function codeinitcode simply instantiates the class in which it is contained and returns it as an object.

The static function codeinitcode looks something like thisp  precodestatic public function init     object  new self    return object  codepre  pNow PHP 5.4 has added support for class member access on instantiation, and instead of using a static class I can now do the followingp  precoderesult  new Foogtbar codepre  pbr strongMy questionstrong Is my old way of using static classes bad, and if so, why Now that PHP supports class member access on instantiation, is this the more correct way of accessing class members immediately after object instantiationp

Negative 488 pIm trying to create a central event dispatching system using kind of an Observer pattern for my small RPG project, and I need advice on how best to represent event data. p  pIll have an EventManager that registers listener classes for different event types defined in a static enum such as EventInputKeyPressed or EventGameActorMoved. It will store events in a queue and dispatch them to the corresponding listeners, which will each have a method handleEventEvent e or something. p  pEach event will be an object of type Event, which holds data such as its event type.p  pMy question is, since the nature of the event data differs considerably between event types, how should this data be represented Im not yet sure exactly what types of events I will want to create in the future, so I want this to be as flexible as possible. For example, an event could trigger other events if certain conditions are true ie. when the player pressed the action key, a door opens if the player is in a certain location and has a key. Is XML or scripts a good choice Another way I can think of is to create a custom class for every general event, like ActorEvent or MenuEvent, but that seems really inefficient and inflexible. Also, since some objects such as Character only need to know very specific events like when the w key is pressed, I figure they dont need to be notified when other keys like h are pressed. Is it viable to create event types that specific or is there a better way ie. EventInputKeyPressedWp  pThanksp

Negative 488 pIm currently using the GroundOverlay function within a KML file to display an circular image.  I know the circle is 48 degrees in diameter, and I want it to look like a circle when I overlay it on the earth.  Rather than being a perfect circle though, its distorted, most visibly at the poles.  I think the reason for the distortion is that GoogleEarth assumes my original image used a map projection, so GE unprojects my image, creating the distortion.  Is there a way to overlay my circular image as a circle through KML or the maps API by turning off the projection  Or is my only option to project my circular image into a simple cylindrical projection before I call GroundOverlay on it  Id really prefer the first option if it exists.p

Negative 488 pIm kind of a beginner with both C and the intricacies of serial communication.  Ill try to provide all the information about this issue that i can let me know if theres anything additional I should provide that would help.p  pIm in the process of porting the communication protocol for a serial device a micromanipulator from C to Python, for use in a Python application my lab is developing.  The company has provided us with the source code for a small command line utility used to interface with the device.  Using this logic, our Python module is able to to generate correctidentical data blocks, including the CRC.  However, when a data block identical to a data block generated by the C code is sent by the Python code, it receives no response from the device.  Using a serial port monitoring program Free Serial Port Monitor, Ive noticed that the communications between Python and the device differ in some cases from the utility provided by the company.  p  pHeres a screenshot of the log for the provided utility, which works properly.  It shows the sending of one data block and its response, as well the sending of a second data block and the start of the response.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comgQ7lV.png altLog Example from utilityp  pAnd heres a screenshot of what happens with our Python code as you can see it sends the data block with no response.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comcfrcZ.png altLog example from pythonp  pAs for other info that might be useful, Im using the standard Python serial libraries.  The structure of the data block is 14 ASCII characters, starting with STX and ending with ETX.  The first eight data characters correspond to functions, addresses, values, etc., while the final four characters are the CRC.p  pAs I said, Im a bit of a noob at this and I really have no idea where to start.  Any advice or assistance, or resources that might help me figure this out would be greatly appreciated, and let me know if theres any more specific info I should providep  pa hrefhttpreentry.mit.eduextserialport.c relnofollowhttpreentry.mit.eduextserialport.cap  pa hrefhttpreentry.mit.eduextserialport.h relnofollowhttpreentry.mit.eduextserialport.hap

Negative 488 pI am new to shell scripting and am attempting to solve a problem.p  pBasically, I need to find instances of a codeREGEXcode pattern in a text file, do some codesedcode editing on each result, and then output the result in place to the original text file without disturbing any other original text.p  pThe mental block Im facing is that a I need to do multiple pattern replacements in order to accomplish the final transformed result, so it cant be fit into a single call to sed, and b if I grep out the results with a codeREGEXcode pattern, it gives me only the results that match that pattern. Ok great, so I go ahead and edit those to transform them into the final desired output, but I want to write this change exactly in place where it was in the text file. You cant codepipecode codegrepcode to codesed icode because it doesnt reference the original file anymore, just the result set. Am I thinking about this in the wrong way or is there some command Im just not aware ofp

Negative 488 pAs part of my diploma project I faced with with a problem of getting GPS coordinates.  I have developed a program with JavaScript and HTML5 that gets coordinates from browser. But the accuracy of the position is very low. I use a method watchPosition with timeout1000p  pSo here is my observationp  ol liI run a HTML5 app on iPhone, and accuracy begins falling. from 150 to 1500 metersli liThan I run an native app with maps on iPhone, like google maps, than I wait when it define my position.li liThan go to my HTML5 app in browser.li ol  pAnd now accuracy is higher than it was about 510 meters.  What has happend And how to make accuray high as it is now without running thirdparty appsp  pThanksp

For example, if I type Delta 1234, or DL1234 into Google, I get back the correct flight information for that airline and flight number.p  pIve implemented the Flight Aware API but it appears it can only understand IATA  ICAO  flight number. So DL1234, or DAL 1234 works, but the API doesnt understand Delta 1234.p  pIm using Delta simply as an example  I need a solution that works with all airlines.p  pLooking over the FlightStats API, it appears to require the same IATA  ICAO query input also. I know one option is to locally store all Airline names and codes and do string matching  logic myself to find the correct codes, but we are on a very tight deadline and would prefer an outofbox solution if one exists.p  pDoes anyone know of an API that provides either querying by airline name  flight number, or an API that provides airline information  codes matching an airline namep

The person should be able to choose the colors from some kind of pallet. So the question is how to make a threshold to obtain frames in only 2 colors.

Negative 488 pIm a IT student in the university, been programming in Visual Basic for a great time. Learnt Java here and C by myselfreally analog to Java. I am also a music producer, and I want to start working on a large project, just for myself, for fun and for expanding my knownledge.p  pI want to make a DAW Digital Audio Workstation like Cubase, Reaper or Fruity Loops. Starting from small things like a Sound Sequencer. I already have some flow diagrams made.p  pI want to start coding it as soon as possible, but Java is an interpreted language as SuperCollider and Python, making it slow for processing. Visual Basic is not an option, I loved starting with it, but I dont like it anymore. I dont know if I should use C, I, as a Linux lover, dont want to marry with Windows just because I need to use Visual Studio. I know there is Mono.p  pWhat is a good language for me Could it be somethingp  ol liFast processing, non interpreted if its possibleli liAble to make my software crossplatform. Without the need of rewriting all the code, maybe just implementing some methonds for different systems.li liWith good documentation.li ol  pI know my question may be a little complicated, even can be seen as inmature. But I need help choosing a new language to learn.p  pThanks for taking your time reading this. Every answer is appreciated.p

Negative 488 pI just started profiling an application that does some codelog linearcode interpolation, and I noticed something strange when calling codeMath.logcode and codeMath.expcode inside each other. The behaviour can be reproduced the following wayp  precodepublic class TestLogExp  public static void mainString[] args      Double thisdouble  0d     thisdouble  Math.logMath.exp10     System.out.printlnthisdouble       codepre  pNow we clearly see that codeMath.logcode and codeMath.expcode are called within this main method. However, when I put a breakpoint in both codeMath.expcode and codeMath.logcode which are just calls to codeStrictMathcode codenative staticscode, the execution is only interrupted in codeMath.expcode, not in codeMath.logcode. p  pNow I thought it could be that codejavacode does not debug calls within calls from static methods, but when I call codeMath.expMath.log10code so the other way around, the same behaviour is observed, only stopping in exp, not in log...p  pAnybody able to reproduce this Why is this happeningp  pstrongEDITstrong It seems like its not debugging the Math.log function at all. Replace the line codethisdouble  Math.logMath.exp10code with codethisdouble  Math.log10code, and still not stopping in debug mode, although theres a breakpoint in Math.class...p

Negative 488 pIs there a way to know what is the type of a Tk widgetp  pAs an example, lets suppose I create a label, using the codetklabelcode command or the codettklabelcode command.p  pAfter that, I just have the path name of the widget, for example code.lcode. Now, Id like to know what was the command used to build code.lcode.p  pWhat I need is a programmatic solution, some code that given the code.lcode path can return the name of the command, and Im interested in emTclem solutions, or even Tcl extensions coded in C.p  pA way to do this could be renaming emallem the widget creation commands with procs that save that information somewhere and then does exactly what the original command would do, but this solution requires that you know all the available widget creation commands, and doesnt take into account user defined widget or megawidgets as a whole.p  pThank you very much for your help.p
Negative 488 pFunctional tests involving the codeTestServercode class of the emPlay Frameworkem seem to work only inside the Play console.p  pUnfortunately the stock test runner in the Play console executed by the codeplay testcode command executes the tests emin sequenceem and that takes a lot of time. I think they would run faster if they were executed parallel.p  pIs there a way to run the tests parallelp  pUpdate SBT supports running tests parallel and in different JVMs that makes it possible to have multiple codeTestServercode instances parallel if they are listening on different ports, in theory. It seems Play ignores these settings. See my reported issue a hrefhttpsgithub.complayframeworkPlay20issues849 relnofollowhttpsgithub.complayframeworkPlay20issues849a.

Negative 488 pSort of a philosophical question, I guess.p  pWe are starting a video game project, and discovering C as we go. One of the first things we need is a way to store constants in a bunch of arrays, so that anyone can access those values easily, and so we can quickly add or modify values as new character or weapon types are defined.p  pNow in C, this is how Ive learned to do itp  ul lideclare an enum in some constants.h file, with its last element being WHATEVERTYPEEND li lideclare constant arrays of size WHATEVERTYPEEND since enums and array indices work well in C li lifill these arrays with various values of different types in constants.cpp.li ul  pAn examplep  pre classlangcpp prettyprintoverridecodeenum FoulType      FOULTYPENONE,     FOULTYPEOUTOFPLAY,     FOULTYPEOFFSIDE,     FOULTYPEVIOLENCE,     FOULTYPERETENTION,     FOULTYPEEND   extern const char FoulTypeNames[FOULTYPEEND]  extern const float FoulSanctionChances[FOULTYPEEND]  extern const ushort FoulSanctionSeconds[FOULTYPEEND]  extern const uchar FoulSanctions[FOULTYPEEND] codepre  pIts neat, since it lets the programmer retrieve modifiers quite effortlessly. If I want to compute how much damage my character will do, I do something likep  pre classlangcpp prettyprintoverridecodeCharacterType charType  myCharacter.getType WeaponType weapType  myCharacter.getWeapon.getType damage  CharacterDamages[ charType ]  WeaponModifiers[ weapType ] codepre  pNow in C, Ive been trying to get my head around how to achieve a similar result. After three hours of peregrinations, I finally have something functionnal, but it looks somewhat hackish.p  pWhat I have is a static class named Constants where public enums are declared, and public static readonly arrays of size intSomeEnum.END are defined. Declaration looks like thisp  pre classlangc prettyprintoverridecodepublic enum WeaponType      Gun  0,     Shotgun,     Assault,     End   public static readonly int[] WeapDamage  new int[ intWeaponType.End]      10,     50,     10  codepre  pArray is readonly and not const because of a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms228606.aspx relnofollowCS0134a. The enum must be cast explicitly to an int, but otherwise it works fine. Now, I know those constants are not really constants, the values of these arrays may be changed  Ive found two possible solutions to this problemp  ul liprotecting the arrays, and using getters, returning a copy of the array if someone really needs the whole thing and not just one value li liusing ReadOnlyCollectionli ul  pSince Im biased towards my old C ways which might themselves not be as clean as I like to imagine, none of these solutions appeals to me particularly not ReadOnlyCollection, since Im mostly superstitiously, I guess... afraid of time andor memory overheads were dealing with a realtime multiplayer game.p  pMostly, I guess, Im afraid the amount of effort I went through just to implement something almostlikebutnotquite what I knew in another language is just a sign that Im not doing things correctly. So, to anyone who has more experience with C andor video game making than I do, what would be the proper way to store a bunch of constants herep

As I was almost sure this definition was right, I went ahead a recreated a new Db, WITHOUT migration. Was perfectly OK, no problems with the Db at all. So there is something in there which EF 6 does not like. I had a confirmation, as EF power tools bombs if I try to get a schema Exception has been thrown by the target of an invocation. p  pIll see what happens now with migration if I restart from there, but I am afraid to not be able to use anymore with this Db. I do like the tool, a lot, so I hope this can be fixed.p

Negative 488 pI have a slider which allows video embeds  currently by pasting in iframe code from youtubevimeo etc. The problem I have is that the video needs to pause the slider when the user clicks the video play button and also pause the video when the slider moves to the next frame.p  pIt seems that I will need to use the vimeo and youtube APIs to get access to the information and control I want. I have looked through the APIs and I think I can probably get this happening however my problem is that from what Ive seen so far the youtube API tends to work off the video ID, whereas the Vimeo API seems to work with iFrames, but I need to have a consistent input for end users in that I want to say strongPaste the video ID herestrong OR strongPaste the Iframe herestrong OR strongPaste the video URL herestrong ... I dont want to have to ask them for an ID from youtube for one video and an Iframe from Vimeo for the next one.p  pI know how to manipulate the data to make the two consistent but Id rather avoid that if at all possible. What is the best approach to get programatic access to Youtube and vimeo so that I can achieve access to play and pause and know whether a video is playing or not.p

Negative 488 pI am querying an entity data model .NET 4.0, and getting wildly different results when run locally vs. running from our development server. Locally the query takes 10 seconds, but on the dev server its taking 7 minutes. Both environments are hitting the same SQL 2005 database i.e. same exact connection string.p  pI took a look at the underlying SQL generated, and found that its different for the two environments. The query generated by the code on the dev server has some extra subqueries that are causing the dramtic slowdown. So what would cause each environments SQL code generator to produce different results for what should be the same queryp  pstrongUPDATE  Removed old sample because it was misleadingstrongp  pI found the cause of the slowness, but I still dont understand why the same code base operating against the same database is producing two different SQL queries.p  pWhats happening is that when I run the code locally, all the constant strings in my query are placed in the SQL query string as normal strings. When I run the same code on the server, the SQL thats generated turns my strings into Unicode stringsp  pGenerated locallyp  blockquote   pWHERE  DENY lt [Extent1].[status] p blockquote  pGenerated on the serverp  blockquote   pWHERE  NDENY lt [Extent1].[status] p blockquote  pAdding and removing the N notation for Unicode on the strings dramatically changes the execution time. So now I know WHY the query is slow, but I still dont know why the SQL code generator on the server is making these strings Unicode, but when run locally its not. I checked the entity data model, and the status column has its Unicode property set to False, so I dont know why the query would ever convert to Unicode.p

Negative 488 pAn important part of any platform PaaS authentications security is to be able to limit andor define a particular application or users rights or permissions on either a userapp basis or a strongperauthenticationstrong basis.p  pThe common permission model found in modern platform or product APIs is based on an idea of strongScopesstrong. In my research, a hrefhttpsdeveloper.github.comv3oauthscopesGitHuba, a hrefhttpsdevelopers.facebook.comdocsreferenceloginFacebooka, a hrefhttpinstagram.comdeveloperauthenticationInstagrama, a hrefhttpwww.etsy.comdevelopersdocumentationgettingstartedoauthsectionpermissionscopesEtsya and more all use this style of permission modeling in their OAuth implementations. However, this scopes model seems to be only concerned with how external ie. third party applications access an authenticated users data.p  pInternally, permission models seem to be either more focused on a role based model admin, moderator, user, etc or a number of other custom implementations.p  pMy question is this strongWhat permission model would best fit a modern PaaS that would like to both limit its users from certain actions AND limit 3rd party applications from accessing a users data, and how could that be architected in a performance conscious waystrongp  pMy initial research led me to an internal and external usage of a scopebased permission model. Unfortunately, architecting such a system isnt trivial. Ive seen multiple methods of creating such an architecturep  ol lipThe ARfriendly relational DB wayp  ul lipCreating multiple tables with join tables for a manytomany relationship between a list of permissions, a users available permissions, a users token, and a user tokens active permissions.pli lipA user may authenticate with a token and specify as many permissions to be available on that token strongup tostrong the permissions originally set for that userpli ulli lipThe clever Bitmasking wayp  ul lipUsing a simple integer column in a data set to store an integer valuepli lipThe integer value is accessed in a binary way, using bitwise operators to set, get, toggle etc the permissions of a user or their token by representing a permission as a single bitpli ulli ol  pTheir seems to be some pros and cons to each. The ARfriendly way seems like its a very flexible solution, but also seems like it could be a serious performance hit, since multiple joinsqueries would have to be run and ORM model instances would have to be created on strongevery authenticated callstrong. The Bitmasking method seems like it would be very fast and efficient, but would be less intuitive to develop and would be more prone to error. Also, bitmasking seems like it would be a limiting solution in that it would only easily allow a very binary permission model can or cannot do with no middlegroundhappymedium and that it would limit the permissions to a hard 64bit limit based on hardware limitations.p  pstrongIs there another method of permission modeling or architecting that Im missingnot thinking of Or am I on the right track and the performance consideration is not as huge a concern as far as the relational method goes as Im making it out to bestrongp  pThank you so muchp  h1tldrh1  pWhat permission model would best fit a modern PaaS that would like to both limit its users from certain actions AND limit 3rd party applications from accessing a users data, and how could that be architected in a performance conscious wayp

Negative 488 pI have a route in my application with a single URL which responds differently based on the Accepts header in the request.

If the user has loaded a URL in their browser previously, but the most recent request to that URL was done by the Javascript with Accept applicationjson, if the back button is used to return to that URL, the browser has the JSON version cached, and displays that instead of the HTML version.p  pI could differentiate the JSON and HTML URLs eg, append jsonTrue, but if there is a better way to do this by correctly using HTTP headers, Id like to know what it is.p

Negative 488 pI am creating a GridView that will initially have a blank row consisting of 2 DropDownLists and one TextBox.  There is a button in the footer that will allow a user to add another row after they have filled in the first.  I am binding this to a SqlDataSource so I am able to use the InsertCommand to call a stored procedure to Insert the users data into a database table.  However, I am not sure how to go about adding an empty row.  Right now, the headers will not show up until a postback call is executed.  I have seen tutorials that use a DataTable to add an empty row, but I could not get this to work with the bound DropDownLists.  Is there a way to add a row to the SqlDataSource from code behind  The following is the relevant part of my ASP pagep  precode        lttablegt         lttrgt         lttd colspan2 stylewidth100gt            ltdivgt             ltaspUpdatePanel IDupUpdateChecklist runatservergt                 ltContentTemplategt                     ltaspGridView IDgvUpdate runatserver AutoGenerateColumnsFalse                                   CssClassmGrid PagerStyleCssClasspgr                                   AlternatingRowStyleCssClassalt                                   ShowHeaderWhenEmptytrue                                   Visibletrue CellSpacing2                                  CellPadding2 ShowFootertrue                                 DataSourceIDdsUpdategt                         ltColumnsgt                             ltaspTemplateField HeaderTextDivisionContextgt                                 ltItemTemplategt                                     ltaspDropDownList IDddDivision runatserver DataTextFieldDivision DataValueFieldID DataSourceIDdsDivisiongt                                 ltItemTemplategt                             ltaspTemplateFieldgt                             ltaspTemplateField HeaderTextApplicationgt                                 ltItemTemplategt                                     ltaspDropDownList IDddApplication runatserver DataTextFieldApplication DataValueFieldID DataSourceIDdsApplication gt                                 ltItemTemplategt                             ltaspTemplateFieldgt                             ltaspTemplateField HeaderTextTaskgt                                 ltItemTemplategt                                     ltaspTextBox IDtbTask runatserver ReadOnlyfalse gt                                 ltItemTemplategt                             ltaspTemplateFieldgt                              ltaspTemplateFieldgt                             ltFooterStyle HorizontalAlignRight gt                             ltFooterTemplategt                                 ltaspButton IDbtnAdd TextAdd New Row runatserver gt                             ltFooterTemplategt                             ltaspTemplateFieldgt                         ltColumnsgt                     ltaspGridViewgt                 ltContentTemplategt             ltaspUpdatePanelgt           ltdivgt         lttdgt         lttrgt         lttablegt        ltaspSqlDataSource IDdsApplication SelectCommandSELECT ID, ApplicationName FROM Automation.dbo.Applications                           runatserver                           ConnectionStringlt ConnectionStringsAutomationDBConnectionString gtgtltaspSqlDataSourcegt         ltaspSqlDataSource IDdsDivision SelectCommandSELECT ID, Division FROM Automation.dbo.Division ORDER BY Application, Division                           runatserver                           ConnectionStringlt ConnectionStringsAutomationDBConnectionString gtgtltaspSqlDataSourcegt        ltaspSqlDataSource IDdsUpdate runatserver                           ConnectionStringlt ConnectionStringsAutomationDBConnectionString gt                           SelectCommandgt                           ltInsertParametersgt                             ltaspParameter NameDivision DbTypeInt32 gt                             ltaspParameter NameApplication DbTypeInt32 gt                             ltaspParameter NameTask DbTypeString gt                           ltInsertParametersgt                           ltaspSqlDataSourcegt codepre

Negative 488 pI created a Qt GUI application and I am trying to package it to share with other people. I built the package and used Dependency Walker to find all of the .dll files that I needed to include. After I put them all in the same directory as the .exe I launched the .exe for the program and I got a message that another .dll was missing I included it. I was asked in the same way to add two more .dll files. After all the .dlls were included I launched the .exe and got this weird message.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comzjFeq.jpg altError messagep  pI consulted Qt 5.0.2 documentation and I couldnt find any help. It works fine when I run it within Qt Creator.p  pI dont know what to do from here but any help would be greatp

Negative 488 pI have a dialog box with a button, and some other controls.p  pWhen that button is pressed a worker thread is spawned.p  pFor easier discussion, let us just say that thread function does a lengthy job.p  pEach time button is clicked, new thread should spawn and do its stuff.p  pDialog box should not be blocked while worker threads do their job, since user should be able to minimize it, click on other controls and so on.p  pOn Wikipedia, i have found a term lockfree algorithm, which refers to non blocking thread synchronization. p  pThis is why I am interested in non blocking thread synchronization. I believe that this will ensure the behavior I need.p  pI am new to multithreading, but I did find some articlesanswered questions about it here, and have read the documentation on Microsoft about it.p  pMost of these use the following algorithmsp  p1.p  pMain thread declares a volatile variable  usually int or bool  and passes it to the worker thread. Worker thread checks the variable in a loop, and if it is not set to indicate its termination, continues to do its work. When it needs to be terminated, parent thread sets the variable.p  p2.p  pThere is also a vast documentation on Microsofts website about synchronization. There, I have found mutexes, critical sections, interlocks and much more.p  pThe problem with these is that they always block the parent thread  usually with WaitForSingleObject or WaitForMultipleObjects API , until worker thread is finished.p  pAlso, searching here, I have found a recent question  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions18164103abortthreadproperlywhendialogboxclosebuttonisclickedAbort thread properly when dialog box close button is clickeda  that has helped me make a start. p  pIn order to solve my problem I will break this question into multiple ones, and post them separately, in order to respect the rules of the StackOverflow.p  pSo my first question for now isp  pWhich APIalgorithm should I use to achieve non blocking thread synchronization, which will help me to achieve dialog box behaves as described above p  pstrongI would also appreciate links to tutorials or code examples, if possible, since I had no luck with Google  also, developers learn best through codepseudo code .strongp  pI will present my initial tries with these code snippets bellow, just in

activate dialog box, and click on the button, worker thread spawn up, and do well if I wait it to finish. p  pYet if I close the dialog box early, the nature of my problem is the same as in the question I have found here  I think that WaitForMultipleObjects in IDCANCEL handler can partialy fix this but I will leave it for another post .p  h2EDIT 1h2  h2I have posted new code, to reflect my progress and problems I have faced.h2  pstrongIMPORTANT NOTEstrongp  pInstead of firing up multiple threads, I have hidden the button that starts a thread, once it is pressed.p  pThis means that user

Negative 488 pI am trying to measure the duration in samples between a start tone 3800Hz and finish tone high amplitude but frequency unknown. The two tones are randomly distributed in a .wav file est. 10 seconds. Is it important to identify the sample number of the last sample of the first tone and the first sample of the last tone How can I do thisp  pThe .wav file contains a fundamental frequency and some noise as well as the start tone and finish tone. I have a prerecording of the start tone with the fundamental frequency and noise in the background, can i use a correlation function to detect itp  pSome of the noise exceeds 3800Hz instantaneously so methods using threshold values for the detecting the tones dont work very well. However, can I use the fact that the tone event is longer in duration than any noise event because it is made deliberately by pressing and releasing a button to detect the tone. p

Negative 488 pJust starting to introduce caching into a new Rails app.  We first set the cachestore to use memorystore in the application.rbp  precodeconfig.cachestore  memorystore codepre  pI then ran some performance tests through NewRelic to see performance beforeafter model caching occurred.p  pAfter that I switched the cachestore to use dallistore since it is the currently recommended gem to use memcached with Rails.    p  precodeconfig.cachestore  dallistore codepre  pI then reran the same beforeafter caching tests against memcached.  There was still an obvious improvement between the cached vs noncached requestresponse however the memcached cached performance was consistently twice as slow roughly as the standard Rails memorystore.p  pJust for clarification, during these tests I ran the memcached server local to the rails web application so as to avoid adding network latency issues into the mix.  p  pAll of this leads me to the following real questions then.p  p1 Is it typical to see faster performance from memorystore over dallistorep  p1a If it is not typical, are there some tricks I dont know besides the standard setup required to get proper performance from memcachedp  p1b If it is typical, then why people using memcached and dallistore on Rails in the first place  Is it a matter of scalibility, etc...p

Negative 488 pIm working with Meteor at the moment, and Im trying to make it look more real timey by adding transitions to numbers as they change.

Negative 488 pThe scenario is as follows. My App is basically a remote for home automation. It controls external devices like a heater, air conditioning, windows aso. Since every device has a different set of possible actions with a variety of in and output parameters I would like to use a custom layout for every device. The idea now is, that a devices manufacturer would just provide the layout.xml and maybe custom button styles as .png or whatever etc. The main reason to do this and instead of simply providing every interfacelayout out of the box, is that there are going to be many thousands of those. So the interfaces would be downloadable content then.p  pGiven that the layout.xml is already downloaded and saved somewhere on the phone, how can I now make use of it and tell my app to use that new layout when creating the Activityp  pI already played a little bit with a hrefhttpandroiddevelopers.blogspot.de201107customclassloadingindalvik.htmlutmsourcefeedburneramputmmediumfeedamputmcampaignFeed3ablogspothsDu28AndroidDevelopersBlog29 relnofollowthis examplea, but it didnt really help me that much.p  pYour help is very much appreciated.p  pYes I did read the developer guidelines and concerns about downloading codecontent at runtimep

Negative 488 pWere using nugetter to make a nupkg as part of our build process for a solution that only builds occasionally, and that we want to distribute in the future. We also want to use this package in other solutions we have.  So far, Ive been able to generate a package that we can install.  Now, I want to be sure that this package updates its version every time its built so we can update the package easily.  Im thinking that using the build number would be a good way to do this, but Id be willing to use just about any incrementing scheme if I dont have to start writing a powershell script to update the nuspec for package on every build.p  pIs there a way to do this automatically in nugetterp  pIf not, is there something easier than modifying the nuspec with powershellp

Negative 488 pI was developing website and decided to separate backendrails and frontendangularjs. All went good until I tried to implement authenticating over JSON. Ive found tons of material on how to implement it with devise, or with doorkeeper, but I cant understand how to put it together. API is implemented with RocketPantsp  pFrom what Ive realized, from frontend I should send login and pass on init, getting back authtoken step 1. Then on every call I should send authtoken with other data step 2p  pOn step 1 Doorkeeper redirectsto signin page. Should I modify controller in way that it should come to controller, which would handle authentication by using warden.authenticate  And how does Doorkeeper know that Im logged in since that moment for giving me authtokenp  pOn step 2 Authtokens are individual per user and per application, which uses API, right So I should somehow specify, from which application request comes, shouldnt I p  pNote Backend is going to be API only, so everything should be handled by JSON requests. But how I modify available applications then One more custom controller over Doorkeeper p  pThanks in advance, I hope, Im not the only one with such questions  p

Negative 488 pI was working on a Simulink model recently and was using codeGotocode and codeFromcode blocks to keep a very busy system from becoming a twisted mess of wires.  I was informed that I was not to use codeGotocode and codeFromcode blocks as they are considered bad style at least, according to my employer.p  pWhile I hold that wires should be kept connected whenever possible, I believe that codeGotocode and codeFromcode blocks can significantly improve the readability of a systemsubsystem if the model would result in lots of crossed wires otherwise especially if the blocks can be colorcoded e.g. purple codeGotocode block goes to all the purple codeFromcode blocks.p  pId supply an image of the subsystem Im working with, but Im not sure I can put it on here.  The subsystem itself has about 12 subsystem blocks and possibly more later within it, each with two bustype outputs.  The first output of each subsystem goes to a codeBus Creatorcode block, and the second output of each goes to a second codeBus Creatorcode block.  Since the subsystem are aligned vertically and the codeBus Creatorcodes are to the right, this results in many crossed wires.  I was using codeGotocode and codeFromcode blocks to clean up the system.p  pI can supply an image of a smaller, but similar model that I put together for this question. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.com1R8js.png altSmall Simulink system depicting crossed wires. For a system with on the order of 12 subsystems, this becomes very busy.  I was using codeGotocode and codeFromcode blocks to connect the subsystems and the codeBus Creatorcodes without a plethora of crossed wires.p  pI believe my employer may be carrying the stigma of using codegotocode statements from textbased languages and applying it to codeGotocodecodeFromcode blocks in Simulink.  Generally speaking, is using codeGotocode and codeFromcode blocks in this way or any way considered to be bad stylep

The longwinged bird of prey has arrived, and were not talking about Pierre the Pelican.  Barely a halfdozen games into his second season, Davis is putting on a nightly show for the rebranded New Orleans Pelicans. Its not just the gaudy stats, although 23 points, 11.5 rebounds and 4.3 blocks tend to get your attention. Rather, its the way he plays dominating stretches of the game with his soft touch, nimble athleticism and dontbringthatweakstuffinhere presence at the rim.  On Friday night against the Lakers, Davis reached back over his body to block a disbelieving Pau Gasol and then sprinted down the court and got fouled at the other basket. The whole play took a couple of seconds, but contained all of the jawdropping athleticism and court sense that makes fans giddy and opponents shake their heads. BEST OF SUNDAY SHOOTAROUND    Bill Russell gets his statue in Boston Stats, storytelling and Sloan New Orleans dreams big The rise of Paul George Hawks try to attract free agents The stories of 201213 In another sequence, Davis caught the ball above the free throw line, took one step to the dotted half circle and dunked from there. He eviscerated Gasol all night, swallowing up his shots and repeatedly beating him and the rest of the Lakers down the floor for dunks, en route to a careerhigh 32 points.  Its not like this is any great surprise. Davis entered the NBA fresh off a devastating season at Kentucky, where he controlled the college game from the opening tip. It was always going to happen. It was just a question of when.  As a rookie, Davis averaged a respectable 13.2 points and 8.5 rebounds while shooting over 50 percent from the field. It was a solid, if relatively unspectacular debut. He finished second in the Rookie of the Year voting to unanimous winner Damian Lillard despite posting a better PER, but no one really argued the decision too strenuously.  Perhaps that was because Davis defensive impact didnt live up to his advanced billing. He blocked his share of shots, but New Orleans was a poor defensive team with him on the court. They werent much better without him, which was an indictment of the whole roster.  Things are starting to change. With Jrue Holiday at the point, the Pelicans have someone to defend the ball, and with the addition of Tyreke Evans and a healthy Eric Gordon, they are more balanced offensively.  Early season small sample sizes abound, but New Orleans is ranked a respectable 11th in defensive rating and an equallyencouraging 11th on the offensive side, per Basketball Reference. Save for a dreadful 20point loss to the Magic in their second game, theyve also been competitive every night out and earned an impressive win in Memphis on Wednesday.  The Pelicans still have a long way to go. The depth is better, but still worrisome. Evans has been slow to adjust to his new role off the bench and Ryan Andersons shooting and floor spacing are sorely missed. But, they are getting there, and thanks to Davis emergence, they may be ahead of schedule.  Here are a few other pleasant developments from the first full week of the season  PAUL GEORGE RISES AND THE PACERS TAKE CARE OF BUSINESS  When we last left the Pacers, they were on the wrong end of a rather incredible sevengame conference finals loss to the Miami Heat. It was incredible because no one really expected Indiana could keep up with Miami in a playoff series. Certainly few expected that George would be able to match LeBron James pointforpoint and shotforshot like he did at times.  It was a massive leap forward for both the team and the player, and George was rewarded with a maximum contract extension in the offseason. Still, the prevailing wisdom was the Pacers would take a backseat to the Bulls once Derrick Rose returned to the court. They were good, obviously, but unless George took a massive leap into the superstar strata, they had probably reached their limit.  NO ONE SHOULD BE EAGER TO PUT A CAP ON [GEORGES] POTENTIAL AFTER WHAT HES SHOWN IN HIS FIRST FEW SEASONS We might want to reconsider. George may not average 2584 and shoot 40 percent from behind the arc for the entire season, but no one should be eager to put a cap on his potential after what hes shown in his first few seasons. The multitalented hybrid forward has improved every year hes been in the league. The only stop left is legit star status.  The Pacers have followed his lead, winning their first six games while dispatching both the Pistons on the road and the Bulls at home. Both George and the Pacers have taken the essential lessons from their postseason baptism and applied them to the regular season. They have cracked the code on winning games. Double digit deficits in the second quarter disappear by the end of the third, and they are mastering the art of putting games away in crunch time.  The Pacers are also not in a mood to give ground back to Chicago. As George told NBA.coms Steve Aschburner  We want to step away from that shadow as the little brothers of this division. Their success is the Michael Jordan era. This is a new age, this is a new team. Its ours till they take it.  GOLDEN STATES D  From Stephen Currys otherworldly shooting to the untapped potential of Klay Thompson and Harrison Barnes, there is much to like about the Warriors this season. They play fast, bomb 3s and have a strong insideout game with Curry and a slimmeddown David Lee. On pure aesthetic grounds, its hard to top the Dubs for nightly entertainment.  Thats all well and good. The Warriors have always been compulsively watchable, even as a guilty pleasure. Whats different this season is their defensive chops.  Its really not that complicated, either. Andre Iguodala is one of the games top perimeter defenders. Andrew Bogut is one of the leagues premier rim protectors. Take those two talents and surround them with willing defenders and a sound scheme and the Warriors  yes the Warriors  have emerged as one of the top defensive squads in the league.  With so much depending on Boguts health, its futile to project where they might end up, but even without Curry on Friday, they battled the Spurs to the wire in a 7674 defeat. It was a frustrating loss, made more so by some endofgame miscues, but it was also encouraging. No way the Warriors hang in a game like that in the past. For now at least, the defense makes them a legit threat.  WELCOME BACK, KEVIN LOVE  The early season is full of obscure trivia, but none had as much resonance as the mark Kevin Love set when he averaged better than 26 points and 15 rebounds in his first five games. The only other player to do that in the last 15 years Kevin Garnett, of course.  Long after his departure, KG still casts a very long shadow over the Timberwolves organization. Every mark, every number and every milestone has his name attached to it. Love and the Wolves thought they were ready to break out and write their own history last season, but injuries wrecked those plans. This year may be the one they get it right.  Love had another monster game on Friday with 32 points and 15 rebounds in a win over the Mavericks. He also had eight assists, which gives him 30 after six games. The numbers become a blur after a while, but no other power forward brings the array of skills that Love brings to the equation. ltpgt  ltdivgt ltdivgtltcentergt ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pCSS3p  precodefullimage  position fixed  top 50  left 50  width  200  height 200   fullimage img  position absolute    top 0    left 0    right 0    bottom 0    margin auto    minwidth 50   minheight 50   center  width1700px marginrightauto marginleftauto  content  minheight2000px backgroundwhite marginleft10px positionrelative top1000px    codepre  pAny help would be appreciated.p

I compile the same code with the same optimization flag, achieving execution time codeT2codep  pWill codeT2 lt T1code or they will be more or less the samep  pIn other words, is the execution time independent from the way that compiler is builtp

Ive checked the CSPROJ file and there is definitely no reference to the removed files in there at the point the changeset was made.p  pWhen my code iterates through all the changes in the changeset it tries to marry up the changed file to the project it belongs to in order to identify what files need to be deployed as a result of the change  ie if its .html or .jpg then it just gets copied but if its source code then I need to deploy the associated binary that gets compiled from the file. So when it finds these files and tries to find a project that they belong to it fails.p  pShould the changeset reference these removed files or is it a bug in TFS Or could it be something that happened when the code was migrated from TFS 2008 to TFS 2012 at some time in the 2 years before the two changesets If its not a bug then in what circumstances would you expect TFS to track changes to files not in the projectp  pIve tried to replicate it by setting up a totally new project and adding it to source control and then adding, removing and editing an associated text file but I cant get it to behave in the same way.p

Negative 488 pIve been working on a fairly large C project for a few weeks now. My original goal was to use this project to learn about C11 and use only pure C code and avoid manual allocation and C constructs. However, I think this problem is going to force me to use C for a small function and Id like to know why.p  pBasically I have a save function that will copy a somewhat large binary file to a separate location before I make changes to the data in it. The files themselves are CD images with a max size of around 700MB. Here is the original C code that I usedp  precodestdiossyncwithstdiofalse  stdifstream ininfile, stdiosbinary stdofstream outoutfile, stdiosbinary  stdcopystdistreambufiteratorltchargtin, stdistreambufiteratorltchargt, stdostreambufiteratorltchargtout  out.close in.close codepre  pThis code when used with a 690MB file takes barely under 4 minutes to complete. I have ran it with multiple files and its always the same result nothing under 3 minutes. However, I also found the following way which ran a little bit faster, but still nowhere as fast as Cp  precodestdiossyncwithstdiofalse  stdifstream ininfile, stdiosbinary stdofstream outoutfile, stdiosbinary  out ltlt in.rdbuf  out.close in.close codepre  pThis one took 24 seconds, but its still around 20 times slower than C.p  pAfter looking around I found someone needing to write an 80GB file and seeing that he could write at full speed using C. I decided to give it a try with this codep  precodeFILE in  fopeninfile, rb FILE out  fopenoutfile, wb  char buf[1024] int read  0    Read data in 1kb chunks and write to output file while read  freadbuf, 1, 1024, in  1024    fwritebuf, 1, 1024, out     If there is any data left over write it out fwritebuf, 1, read, out  fcloseout fclosein codepre  pThe results were pretty shocking. Here is one of the benchmarks I have after running it multiple times on many different filesp  precodeFile Size 565,371,408 bytes C     1.539s  350.345 MBs C  24.754s  21.7815 MBs  out ltlt in.rdbuf C 220.555s  2.44465 MBs  stdcopy codepre  pWhat is the cause of this vast difference I know C wont match the performance of plain C, but 348MBs difference is massive. Is there something Im missingp  pEditp  pI am compiling this using Visual Studio 2013 on a Windows 8.1 64bit OS.p  pEdit 2p  pAfter reading John Zwincks answer I decided to just go the platform specific route. Since I still wanted to make my project crossplatform I threw together a quick example. I am really not sure if these work on the other systems besides Windows, but I can test Linux at a later date. I cannot test OSX, but I think copyfile looks like a simple function so I assume its correct.p  pKeep in mind you need to do the same ifdef logic for including platform specific headers.p  precodevoid copystdstring infile, stdstring outfile  ifdef WIN32  WIN64     Windows   CopyFileAinfile.cstr, outfile.cstr, false elif APPLE     OSX   copyfileinfile.cstr, outfile.cstr, NULL, COPYFILEDATA elif linux     Linux   struct stat statbuf   int infd, outfd   offsett offset  0    infd  openinfile.cstr, ORDONLY   fstatinfd, ampstatbuf   outfd  openoutfile.cstr, OWRONLY  OCREAT, statbuf.stmode    sendfileoutfd, infd, ampoffset, statbuf.stsize    closeoutfd   closeinfd endif  codepre

Negative 488 pI have a validation annotations that detects swearwords. My swearwords are in database, but I want to keep them in memory to avoid unnecessary queries. I was thinking of adding a static list of swearwords as plain old strings to the validation annotation class and fill it up based on what I have in database when the validation is used for the first time during an application run. Are there any risks related to using such solutionp  pP.S. I dont really care if someone adds more words to the database during the run of the application. Having an incomplete list till next restart is good enough the app is going to be restarted every day anyway.p
Negative 488 pIm new to geocoding so Im not certain this is even the question I should be asking, but all of the other discussions Ive seen on this topic here and on the Google API forum are so application specific that I feel like I might be missing a very elementary step  I dont need to know emhowem to implement a store finder  I need to know if I emshouldem.p  pHere is my specific situation  I have been contracted to design an application wherein we will build a database of shops say, independently owned bars and pubs.  This list will continually grow and change as shops close and new ones open.  The user can enter hisher point of origin zip code or address and be shown a list or map containing all the various shops within a given radius in order of proximity.p  pI know how to deliver these results from a static database One would store the longitude and latitude as columns for each row and then just use that information to check distances.p  pBut I have inherited an already fairly large database of shops which have addresses but emnotem coordinates  so Im not sure what the best way to get those addresses is.  I could write a script to query them one at a time against google geocoding, I could have a data entry person manually look up the coordinates for each one and populate the data that way, or maybe there is a third option Im not aware of.p  pIs this the right place to be asking this question  Google Maps Geocoding doesnt host a forum of their own, but refers people to Stack Overflow.  Other forums on the net dealing with this topic are all relating to a specific technical question but no one seems to be talking about it from a topdown perspective ie the big picture.p  pGoogle imposes a 2,500 queries per day limit on free users and a 100,000 queries a day limit on paid ones  neither of these seem to be up to the task of a site with even moderate traffic if, every time a user makes a request, the entire database perhaps thousands of shops are being checked against Googles data.  It seems certain we must store the coords locally but even storing them locally, there will have to be checks against Google in order to plot them on a map.  If I had a finite number of locations if, for example, I had six hardware shops and I wanted to make a store locator, there would be a wealth of discussions, tutorials, and stack overflow questions available to point the way for me, but Im dealing with a potentially vast number of records and not sure how to proceed or where to begin.p  pAny advice would be welcome  Additionally, if this is not the best place to be asking this question, a helpful response would be to indicate a better place to post it.  Ive searched for three days but havent found what looks like a good resource for asking such subjective questions.p

Negative 488 pI recently found out that reading SUB charactera hrefhttpwww.theasciicode.com.arasciicontrolcharacterssubstituteasciicode26.html relnofollowASCII code 26a using codefgetc,fscanfcodeCommon functions in C to scan characters makes both of the interpret it as an error and return EOF. I was wondering if there is any way  to detect SUB character so that I can distinguish between the real end of file and the apparent one.p  pstrongNotestrong The conclusion I am presently on is that end of file is detected using an error in scanning, as SUB character is used to represent error the task looks impossible.

Negative 488 pIm asking this question with the intent of answering it. I asked it on the Spring forums a couple of months ago, and I found the solution through experimentation shortly after. But Im posting it here in case someone else hits the same scenario and because I was told to.p  pI have a Spring MVC endpoint codeworkcode whose processing is IO bound and can take a few seconds to complete. Enter Servlet 3 asynchronous requests and Spring MVC a hrefhttpdocs.spring.iospringdocs3.2.xspringframeworkreferencehtmlmvc.htmlmvcannasync relnofollowasynchronous request processinga. I can return a codeCallableltFoogtcode or codeDeferredResultltFoogtcode and free up my servlet container threads to do something useful while that processing is happening.p  pNow its likely that other users will make the identical request. Theres no point repeating the work that was done, so Im going to cache the result of the work the first time it completes, and want to return that cached result. So now, the exact same handler method can take either a few seconds to complete or a couple of milliseconds to complete.p  pMy problem is that I can only give the handler method one signature, and Ive defined it as returning codeCallableltFoogtcode. I cant figure out how to kill this overhead for the short requests as it stands, Id create a codeCallableltFoogtcode, enqueue it behind longrunning tasks and wait for a thread in the thread pool to get its hands on it, and all to eventually serve the response I already had in hand. Id like to avoid all this.p  pIf I use a codeDeferredResultltFoogtcode instead of a codeCallableltFoogtcode, things get a bit better performancewise, but Ive taken the processing out of a Spring managed thread, lost Spring Securitys SecurityContext, and have polluted nonweb code with the Springspecific codeDeferredResultcode.p  pIs there an efficient way to sometimes serve responses asynchronously and sometimes serve them synchronously from the same MVC handler methodp

Negative 488 pIve been reading a lot about threading but cant figure out how to find a solution to my issue. First let me introduce the problem. I have files which need to be processed. The hostname and filepath are located in two arrays.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comG9UZn.png altenter image description here brNow I want to setup several threads to process the files. The number of threads to create is based on three factorsbr A The maximum thread count strongcannotstrong exceed the number of unique hostnames in all scenarios.br B Files with the same hostname strongMUSTstrong be processed sequentially. I.E We cannot process stronghost1strongfile1 and stronghost1strongfile2 at the same time. Data integrity will be put at risk and this is beyond my control.br C The user may throttle the number of threads available for processing. The number of threads is still limited by condition A from above. This is purely due to the fact that if we had an large number of hosts lets say 50.. we might not want 50 threads processing at the same time.p  pIn the example above a maximum of 6 threads can be created. p  pThe optimal processing routine is shown below.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comqmOfk.png altOptimal processing routineRoutinep  pbrp  precodepublic class fileprepobj      public string[] filepaths     public string[] hostname     public Dictionaryltstring, intgt mydictionary      public void getfiles              hostname  new string[] host1, host1, host1, host2, host2, host3, host4,host4,host5,host6          filepathsnew string[]Chost1file1,Chost1file2,Chost1file3,Chost2file1,Chost2file2,Chost2file2,                                 Chost3file1,Chost4file1,Chost4file2,Chost5file1,Chost6file1         The dictionary provides a count on the number of files that need to be processed for a particular host.         mydictionary  hostname.GroupByx gt x                         .ToDictionaryg gt g.Key,                         g gt g.Count        This class contains a list of filepaths associated with the same host.

Negative 488 pI have been reading around how codedynamiccastcode works and from what I gathered so far, it obtains the object, gets the vptr, goes to the vtable and in the 1 or 0th element, there is a pointer to a codetypeinfocode object. However, from this point on it gets a little hazyp  pDoes the codetypeinfocode object contain all data necessary to possibly do the cast, or does the runtime system need to access other typeinfo objects p  pI am trying to understand how many different objectsvtables and typeinfo objects are accessed whilst checking an inheritance hierarchy during codedynamiccastcode.p  pEDIT Compilerwise MSVC or GCCp

Negative 488 pI am working on some code that is meant to run on x86 in 32bit mode. In that mode, I understand that Ive got only 8 SIMDAVX2Registers YMM07 to freely work with. However, some of my vector subroutines alone sometimes use more than that amount of registers simultainiously meaning that they are still needed somewhere down the road  mostly not so far afterwards.p  pMy understanding is, that compilers will export older registers to strongstack memorystrong when they cant find unused registers. But how much does this impact performance  e.g. in cycles per exportimport later on. Can I trust in stack memory mostly residing in L1DCache with 2 cycles latency in Haswell or is there a significant performance impact of avoiding such registertomemory and vice versa transfers  p  pSo far I wasnt able to find answers to this topic, especially since the registers keep getting bigger and bigger 1 Cacheline per register with upcoming Skylake platform. It would be nice if you could give sources in case you answer.p

The image below highlights the issue, as soon as a client is clicked on, that view pink, ClientListCtrl has its controller called again, and a rerender is triggered, scrolling to the top of that divp  pIs there any way using multiple views  controllers to avoid this I could pass around an activeClient object in services which should propegate to the various controllers, but then I loose pastable urls to navigate to a state.  p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.combCmA5.png altenter image description herep

The envVarSettingFile is a script that takes in an argumentproject in this case and sets the environment variable RELEASE and exports it.

It sets the environ variable and prints the RELEASE variable. However, for some reason, this doesnt seem to work in python. Note that I have tried using subprocess.callcmd, shellTrue and this doesnt do anything. Also, when executing this python script that contains this code, it basically gets stuck right at codeos.systemcmdcode and I have to kill the process manually.p

Negative 488 pWe have developed a Sitecore site for a client who will primarily be using Page Editor. Weve built page type layouts and then componentized everything else, including sublayouts of content. This allows them the most flexibility when building pages.p  pSo, an author goes to a page selects the main content area Placeholder of the page and inserts basic building block components that weve created. These include Rich Text box, page promos, etc. they can use these to build pretty rich pages with lengthy content. p  pThe challenge weve run into is that every time a user adds a one of these components create a new content item, they need to name it and an item gets created under the page item in the tree. So you could have Page  Rich Text 1, Rich Text 2, Image, Promo, Rich Text 3, etc. This results in a complicated tree thats hard to navigate. Also, we dont want them to have to name each, since those names are irrelevant.p  pWere looking for ways to make this easier on the authors, such as automatically generating some logical name for the new item, maybe storing them all in one folder instead of under the page, or hiding them somehowp  pId love to hear some thoughts on how we could clean this up, or how others have architected similar solutions. p  pThanksp

I wonder if i am creating my constraints in the right UITableViewCell methods.p  pIs there any best practice telling in which method we should create or update the layout constraints p
Negative 488 pso I have a simple application using a storyboard. I have a few view controllers linked by segues. I also have one controller set as the default first view controller. I understand that no code is required for the app to automatically load this was the first controller. However I want the app to first run a few checks i.e. is the user logged in before it decides which controller to push. Is there anywhere I should be putting this code or should I remove the first view controller setting on the storyboard and init manuallyp  pThanksp

This sum will be calculated and updated with Javascript every time the user enters a valid value in codePrincipalcode or codeInterestcode.p  pHow can I detect when a new, strongvalidstrong, nonnegative amount has been entered in either of these fieldsp  pIf I were using a custom attribute this would be easy. I could simply perform the calculation whenever the custom jQuery unobtrusive function found a positive value. The unobtrusive function would tell me if the value was valid. p  pMaybe I should just detect key up and then perform the calculation if the value is positive. This seems redundant though since jQuery unobtrusive is already doing this same thing.p

How do we know which JSON provider is actually used How do we select one How do we customize the behaviorp  pThe application is pure JAXRS and does not use any JSON processor directly, instead relying on marshalling of JAXBannotated classes. Introduction of any nonJavaEE dependencies is highly undesirable, since the application is intended to be portable across containers TomEE, GlassFish, some day WildFly.

Negative 488 pI have done some searching on the internet but fail to find an answer, so I come here hopefully to find it. So my guess would be that it would because say if i declare one codefinal int foo  6code it because it wouldnt change in size that it will only be set to what it needs in terms of memory. Where as a variable codeint bar  8code will have to have a larger size in memory because it has a chance later in the program in change.p

Negative 488 pI am writing a piece of software that will act as a middle man between some warehouse management software and automated vehicle hardware. My program has an entity model of a DB that lives on a server.p  pThe vehicle hardware we are using comes with some software that allows it to read and write to a DB.p  pI would like to set up events in my entity models that would fire when a particular field is updated.p  pIn example The vehicle might encounter an error, it would then write some values to a table in the DB. My program then needs to recognize this change and inform the WM software.p  pThis solution needs to be event driven as I can not sacrifice CPU to constantly poll the DB for changesp  pI have seen many solutions to this by overriding the SaveChanges method for the entity, however it appears to me that would only work if the changes are coming from the application itself, not from an outside source.p  pIs this possible Does EF have this built in and im just not seeing itp  pWhen the physical DB updates does EF call saveChangesp  pMany Thanksp

Negative 488 pCould someone please help me with an understanding of the Run Configurations in Eclipsebr Here is the issue I am trying to resolve I am developing a c application using CDT in Eclipse Luna.  I have to two source files, lets say I have file01.cpp and file02.cpp.  Both of them have main function.  Both of these files are in the same project.  Essentially I want to compile and then run a configuration 1 and configuration 2 where the gcc compiler would only compile file01.cpp and file02.cpp respectfully.  I achieved mixed success where under the same configuration I would apply a Resource Configuration filter, but this is inefficient since I have to doundo same filtering operation many times.  I believe this is what the configurations are used for.  p  pI looked at the eclipse manual, found exact place where this topic is discussed.  Unfortunately, there is not much info there and also I think that manual might be outdated some of the menu items are not where manual claims them to be.  p  pSo my understanding is that I create a configuration, include whatever files I want to include, compile that configuration and then run that configuration.  Question  How do I do that in Eclipse  p  pMany thanksp

Negative 488 pIm trying to have 6 images standing next to each other in one row and stay that way regardless of window size.p  pWhen I do them normally with a div tag something like stylewidth33 they get scaled down and fit one screen, but when I shrink the window screen the images get mixed up in two or more rows.p  pI tried putting them in a table tag but to no success.

Negative 488 pI am using winsock2 api, tcp sockets with a server and a client. I am using blocking send and recv. Communication is like this Server sends query to client and client replies back.

Negative 488 pIm making a primitive game with Javascipt for fun.  I have set up functions to move my character around when the arrow keys are pressed as followsp  precodedocument.getElementByIdcharacter.style.top  0 document.getElementByIdcharacter.style.left  0  document.body.onkeydown  function  var e  event.keyCode,     charTop  parseIntdocument.getElementByIdcharacter.style.top,     charLeft  parseIntdocument.getElementByIdcharacter.style.left      if e  40  down function         document.getElementByIdcharacter.style.top  parseIntdocument.getElementByIdcharacter.style.top  10  px      else if e  37  left function         document.getElementByIdcharacter.style.left  parseIntdocument.getElementByIdcharacter.style.left  10  px      else if e  39  right function         document.getElementByIdcharacter.style.left  parseIntdocument.getElementByIdcharacter.style.left  10  px      else if e  38  up function         document.getElementByIdcharacter.style.top  parseIntdocument.getElementByIdcharacter.style.top  10  px        codepre  pand it works, but not the way Id like it to.  I find that if you hold down an arrow key, it will move once, wait a second, then continuously move until you let go.  I think what is causing this is Windows built in function to repeat a pressed button at a speed set in Control Panel after a specified delay.p  pI would prefer that the character move immediately and continuously without the delay.  I am not sure how to go about this.  Id also like to be able to define how quickly to move again if the button is still pressed it moves ten pixels at a time, and if it repeated too quickly it would fly across the screen.p  pI know that Javascript is not really meant for game programming, but hopefully someone can think of a way around this  Thanksp

Negative 488 pNew to Redis. Need some help.p  pUSE CASE I have thousands of leaderboards. They have usernames in them with appropriate scores. A user can belong to 1 or more leaderboards. I need an efficient way to get the rank of every leaderboard a particular user belongs to, preferrably sorted by rank and with pagination. Typical user will belong to hundreds of leaderboards.p  pAS FAR AS I GOT I keep a set for each user containing boards he belongs to. To get a users ranks I get his set of boards then zrank each board in the set and then order it by rank in my code. This seems very inefficient and does not support pagination.p  pI have been reading and brainstorming and I am stuck. What I need is something likep  puser1boards a,c,ebr boarda user1,user23,user5br boardb user2,user7,user12br boardc user2,user1,user42br boardd user36,user4,user9br boarde user6,user19,user1brp  pSORT user1boards BY boarduser1p  pSimilar to sorting by hash fields except  in this case means the sorted set score of the member provided. Would there be any performance improvement if such a feature existed Or would it be the same as pipelining all the zranksp  pThanks.p

Negative 488 pIs it possible to use the same generic name for two pointers of different type The following of course doesnt work, but it should make clear what I meanp  precodereal4, pointer  sp real8, pointer  dp generic  p gt sp,dp codepre  pFor procdures these things can be done with interfaces defining destinguishable procedures as codemodule procedurecode and for type bound procedures there exists the codegenericcode type that is used similar to the given example. So I wonder if something like this exists for pointers too. p  pId like to mention that unlimited polymorphic pointers codeclasscode are probably not what I want, since Im trying to generalize an existing library to double precision input, thus Id have a lot more work in implementing the codeselect typecode blocks than just defining two pointers everywhere.p  pEDITp  pIt is of course possible to associate the same pointer with variables of different typekind. Just some examplesp  precodeprogram test     implicit none    real4,target  a    real8,target  b    class,pointer  p     a2e0    b3d0     pgta    call printerp    aa4e0    call printerp    pgtb    call printerp     associate ugta        for me its still a miracle why this even works       print,u       aa3e0       print,u    end associate    associate ugtb       print,u    end associate  contains     subroutine printerp        class,pointer  p        select type p        type is real4          pp2d0               even the wrong 2d0 gets converted correctly          print,p       type is real8          print,p       end select     end subroutine  end program codepre  pMy problem with this solution is that I would have to implement codeselect typecode blocks everywhere in the library where the pointer is used. At the moment I only know that its many places.p  pSo the main problem is that the unlimited polymorphic pointer p in the example stays polymorphic unless it is used inside a codeselect typecode environement. This is of course necessary, since the pointer could be everything. So the actual question is Is there a possibility to tell the polymorphic pointer in advance You can only be either this or that e.g real4 or real8 and depening on what it is associated to, it knows what it isp  pThe answer is probably no, but at the moment I dont really see, in which situtation the compliler might have problems to distinguish between typeskinds.p

Negative 488 pIm using Visual Studio 2013 v120xp, and Im programming using static libraries. RunTime Library is set to MT multithreading, so I dont need extrenal .dlls. Today I added a function to display a hrefhttpscode.msdn.microsoft.comwindowsdesktopsendingtoastnotifications71e230a2 relnofollowWindows 8 toast notifications from desktop app.a Everything works fine, but when Im testing the program on a Virtual Machine with Windows XP or Vista it shows that apimswincorewinrtstringl110.dll and apimswincorewinrtl110.dll were not found. When I paste the mentioned .dlls to the same folder as the .exe  everything runs fine. My question is What should I do, to link those .dlls as static I hate to use additional .dlls and I want my program to be very portable limited just to 1 .exe file. Sorry if my question is not clear enough, but I hope its understandable. I treat programming as a hobby, so there are still many things I have to learn.p

The lineChart works in a separate html file completely and the 3 gaugeCharts work as well also separately in one html document. Honestly Im pretty lost and cant seem to get my working charts to be shown together in harmony. Can you please help to solve this As you can see I added all the css html javascript jquery and JSON code. But the problem is just in the html file somewhere. p
Negative 488 pI have codeUIButtoncode that was created with storyboard. The size of the button is different on different iPhone devices. Then I set as background image an image with same width and height images assets for different resolution. I test my app with iPhone 6 and iPhone 4. The size of my button is different on both screens. That is normal, but the background image is stretched on iPhone 4 with iPhone 6 not because probably the size of the button on iPhone 6 is square  same width and height. p  pMy question is if it is possible to show the image without stretching no matter the button size. I searched on the net and found about slicing image. But I dont understand how can I solve this problem   p

Negative 488 pSo I need to do multiple bulk inserts into a table with row level triggers.

Negative 488 pWhat I do know, is that NodeJSs reponses to requests are faster than PHP scripts, because NodeJS server is always running, in a loop waiting for events this is how I understand this.p  pBut Im wondering what exactly happens when we make a request to a PHP script. Is the entire PHP engine loaded into memory every time Or maybe something else must happenp  pIm asking this because I recently had a discussion with a friend of mine. I wrote a comments module to an existing application. When comments are displayed, I shorten longer comments and I add a link like show more  this link only makes a given comment visible, nothing more, because the full content of the comment is already there. And he said that in his opinion its better to download only a part of a long comment at the beginning, and then when user clicks show more I should use AJAX to download full content of the comment and then display it. I always thought that every, even small request, is very CPU and memory greedy. Hence the question.p

Negative 488 pIve done hours of research on asynchronous programming, but I just cant seem to grasp this one single concept within Node, so I was wondering if someone here could help me.p  pIve written the following code sample to return  output a simple string which is a concatenation of strings from an objectp  precodevar itemCollection       item1  [ foo  bar ,  foo  bar ,  foo  bar ],     item2  [ foo  bar ,  foo  bar ,  foo  bar ],     item3  [ foo  bar ,  foo  bar ,  foo  bar ]   var aString    foritem in itemCollection     for var i  0 i lt itemCollection[item].length i          var anItem  itemCollection[item][i]          someFunctionThatDoesALongIOOperation takes an item as a param, plus a callback.         someFunctionThatDoesALongIOOperationanItem, functiondataBackFromThisFunction              Do something with the data returned from this function             aString  dataBackFromThisFunction.dataToAppend                 console.logaString codepre  pSo from what I understand, languages other than Javascript would run codesomeFunctionThatDoesALongIOOperationcode strongsynchronouslystrong and the script would run in a blocking mode. This would mean that the value codeaStringcode would get returned  outputted with its correct value.p  pHowever, as Node runs strongasynchronouslystrong, code can continue to run at anytime and tasks may not complete in order. This is because of the way the event loop works in Node. I think I get this.p  pSo this is where my question comes in. If I wanted the value codeaStringcode to be returned  outputted with its correct value like it would in other languages, what would I need to do to the loops within my code example Or to put my question in more technical words What is the correct approach for making codeaStringcode return the expected result, so that IO operations which take a  longer amount of time to run arent completed after the script has finished executing when codeaStringcode has already been returnedp  pI hope my question makes sense, if it doesnt, please let me know and I will make edits where appropriate.p  pThank youp

Negative 488 pI am working on eclipse RCP product. I want to know how to add hints to users. I mean when they open our tool for the first time, I want to add some hints to click here and there kind of a walkthrough of the tool. Not just light bulb hint which we see in eclipse, some other different types of arrows as well. My requirement can be best illustrated with the interactive tutorial of criminal case game in facebook. Please check this image with hints a hrefhttpwww.mobygames.comimagesshotsl673844criminalcasebrowserscreenshotfirstcrimesceneatutorial.jpg relnofollowhttpwww.mobygames.comimagesshotsl673844criminalcasebrowserscreenshotfirstcrimesceneatutorial.jpga. When the user accesses the game for the first time, they have a very nice walk through. Can this be done in eclipse May be not this much fancier, but at least basic version with an arrow to indicate user to click the button, and then the next button, and so on. Please let me know if any of you have idea on this. It would be of great help. Please point me to any example if it is available online.p

Negative 488 pstrongGoalstrong Im trying to restore state on a tab controllerbased app with navigation controllers on each tab. p  pstrongProblemstrong On relaunch, the selected tab seems to be restored as expected, but the navigation hierarchy inside said tab is not.p  pstrongDevelopmentstrongp  ol liI first started with the project template Tab based app.li liNext, I added restoration IDs to both child view controllers and the tab bar controller.li liIn the app delegate, I implemented codeapplicationshouldSaveApplicationStatecode and codeapplicationshouldRestoreApplicationStatecode.li ol  pI run then app, switch to the second right tab, hit home, terminate. o  relaunch, the right tab is displayed as expected. strongSo far so good.strongp  ol start4 liNext, I go to the storyboard and embed both child view controllers in respective navigation controllers, and assign restoration IDs to those too.li ol  pI run the app, and restoration still works. strongStill good.strongp  ol start5 lipNext, I add a detail view controller its class is a custom subclass of codeUIViewControllercode to the storyboard, with properties to configure the contents of a debug label and its views background color.pli lipI placed a Show Detail... button on each of the tabs top view controllers, and create a segue from each into the shared detail view controller. So now my storyboard looks like a hexagon also, both segues have identifiers set in Interface Builder. So, both left and right top view controllers share the same type of detail view controller. On show, it is configured so as to distinguish from where it has been pushed see next point.pli lipOn each of the top view controllers codeprepareForSeguesendercode method, I configure the pushed detail view controller differently Different text and background color left and blue, and right and red, respectively. pli lipI added code to the detail view controller to save and restore the state of the text and background color properties codeencodeRestorableStateWithCodercode and codedecodeRestorableStateWithCodercode. Also, I implemented codeviewDidLoadcode so as to reflect those properties values in the view. Whenever it is instantiated and pushed into the navigation through a segue, the properties are first set and then used to configre the view in codeviewDidLoadcode. Whenever it is instantiated during restoration, the properties are set in codedecodeRestorableStateWithCodercode and similarly used in codeviewDidLoadcode.pli ol  p...but when I run this code, strongthe last selected tab is restored but only up to the top view controllerstrong left or right, strongnot the detailstrong. Interestingly, the background color last set to the detail view controller flashes for an instant.p  pI placed break points in codeencodeRestorableStateWithCodercode and codedecodeRestorableStateWithCodercode, but only the first of them is executed emencodeem.p  ol start9 liWondering what might be missing, I went ahead and implemented the app delegates codeapplicationviewControllerWithRestorationIdentifierPathcodercodereturning always nil, but logging the path components passed.li ol  pThe documentation is not very clear on whether this method is needed or not, and in any case all view controllers except the detail seem to be restored perfectly even without it. I added code to instantiate each view controller based on the last path component i.e., that controllers restoration ID and returning it.p  pNow, the codedecodeRestorableStateWithCodercode emisem called, but the navigation still goes back to the tabs top view controller after a split second.p  pSo, what is going on What am I missing to implement State Preservation and Restoration in a Tab Bar  Navigation Controller appp

Negative 488 pI run into a problem while querying a sesame triple store using SPARQL. After Ive run several queries successfully, the connection to the triple store blocks. Ive been able to pinpoint the problem at codeAbstractConnPool.getPoolEntryBlockingcode line 306 codesuccess  future.awaitdeadlinecode of the codeapachehttpcomponentscode library. If I understand correctly this method blocks when the maximum number of connections in exceeded. The maximum is 5 connections, and indeed the number of open connections in the pool at that point is 5.p  pWhat I do not understand is why there are 5 open connections at that point. The problem happens when I call the codeevaluatecode method on a codeTupleQuerycode.
