I might just be missing them however, I find it really hard to navigate. If I use Fiddler I cant see any requests or responses when the get method fires, but I do see them when I use Chrome.p  pIve looked at similar questions and they mostly seem to involve missing semicolons, which I think I have covered, or crossdomain requests, which I think would have broke Chrome as well. So Im a little stumped.p

Positive 34063 pI am using jQuery UI 1.9.2. I am using codejQueryUI.dialogcode to create a modal window.p  pI am getting a problem when the user tries to use the dialog in IE8. IE8 has a stupid issue where it cannot apply focus to an element if it is not visible on the page. My modal doesnt pop up immediately, so this error is causing the rest of the page to crash.p  pI have looked at this question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1202079preventjqueryuidialogfromsettingfocustofirsttextboxPrevent jQuery UI dialog from setting focus to first textboxap  pAnd while this and many other answers provide workarounds creating a hidden codeinputcode field just before the button to feign that none of the buttons have focus this will not work for me because it is still trying to add codefocuscode to a hidden element which will give that IE8 error.p  pIs there some kind of parameter or something in the modal dialog call that I can use to NOT add any focus at allp  pIf I had it my way, I would just like to tell the client to suck it up and stop supporting 6year old IE8 but I digress...p

Positive 34063 pI have an ASP.net MVC application that Ive developed using Visual Studio 2015 Enterprise that is not behaving nicely in IE8, and as much as Id like to just declare IE8 as unsupported, this is unfeasible from a business perspective at the moment. p  pSo, to test in IE8, I downloaded a VirtualBox containing an instance of windows with IE8 from a hrefhttpsdev.modern.ietoolsvmswindows relnofollowherea. p  pIve been successful in using this instance of IE8 to connect my organizations dev server which is running Windows Server 2012r2, IIS 8.5.9600, so Ive been able to reproduce the issue.

I thought that in order for the two providers to be able to create association between  their users and roles, they would both have to use same value for emApplicationNameem property. But that doesnt seem to be the case. p  pA Anyways, I assume that emSqlRolesProvider.ApplicationNameem property is only used to distinguish between table entries belonging to different role providers, but they dont use that property in order to associate their roles only with membership providers with the same emApplicationNameem valuep  pB But wouldnt it be most practical if roles providers could only be associated with membership providers with the same emApplicationNameem value  thus where codeSqlRolesProvider.ApplicationName  SqlMemebershipProvider.ApplicationName code p  pbrp  pbrp  pQ2  I was also curios whether roles and users could be associated if roles provider was connected to emDB1em, while membership provider was connected to emDB2em. Somehow I was still able to assign users to different roles, even though roles were defined in different database. p  pbrp  pA But why is that Namely, if emSqlRolesProvider.ApplicationName  rolesPem  emApplicationID10em  and emSqlMembershipProvider.ApplicationName  membershipem  emApplicationID100em , then in order for the table in emDB1em to have relationship with table in  emDB2em, the two would have to reference each other via emApplicationNameem entry  actually via ApplicationID, which would act as foreignprimary key.p  pBut the thing is, none of the foreign key fields in emDB1sem tables holds a value equal to emSqlMembershipProvider.ApplicationID  100em, which would suggests that there is no relationship established between tables in emDB1em and emDB2em  I know that is not the case, since Im able to assign users to roles . So what am I missing p  pbrp  pthanxp  pbrp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pUh, dont know if anybody will still be reading this, but I did some more digging and got even more confusedp  pIf both roles with emapplicationNameR1em and emapplicationID10emand membership providerwith emapplicationNameM1em and with emApplicationID100em are in same DB, then creating a new user causes aspnetUsers table two create two entries for same user name one with emApplicationID10em and other with emApplicationID100em.  As far as I know, when new user is created, only one field  with emApplicationID100em should be added to aspnetUsers. Uhp

The PC was replaced a month ago the old one died, and since then the programs timing behavior changed.

An example program flowp  precodegt wait for keystroke... gt  keystroke occurred gt send ON message gt wait 150ms gt send OFF message codepre  pDifferent keystrokes have different waiting periods associated with them, between 20ms and 150ms a very deterministic time depending on the specific keystroke. The timing is very important. The waiting is executed using simple codeSleepcode. The accuracy of the sleep on the old PC was 12ms deviation. I can measure the timing externally to the computer on the external card, so my measurement of the sleep time is very accurate. Please take into account this machine executed such ONsleepOFF cycles thousands of times a day for years, so the accuracy data I have is sound.p  pSince the PC was replaced the timing deviation is more than 10ms. p  pI did not install the previous PC, so it may had some additional software packages installed.

Negative 34063 pIm sure this is a question to which most of the answers will be Why are you doing that, but I thought I would ask.p  pIve got a table of Users, the vast majority of which just have an ID as theyre lazily created users for sessions that have never provided any information, and dont use the rest of the columns in the database.

There are loads of tables with foreign keys to the table, but only two or three that can reference these fake users.p  pFor a lot of these tables Ive just switched the mapping to map the codeuseridcode rather than the User object, but some objects would like to have the whole User object there if it exists in the table, and null otherwise.p  precodeCREATE TABLE users AS userid bigint CREATE TABLE shoppingcarts AS cartid bigint, userid bigint codepre  pI cant see how to map this in Hibernate.p  precodeEntity class User    Id   long id   Entity class ShoppingCart   Id  long id  Columnuserid  long userid  Might not correspond to a user.

Negative 34063 pIn WPF, I want to use a pixel shader to modify a composite image i.e. a new image overlaid on top of a previously shaded image.  The new image comes in as a largely transparent image except where there is data think mathematical functions  sine wave, etc.  Anyway this process needs to repeat pretty rapidly  compose the currently shaded texture with a new image and then shade the composite image.

Negative 34063 pIm trying to write a monitor app for Dream Daemon, a specific server app.  Since the server app tends to crash specifically, Dream Daemon is a server for a specific brand of interpreted code, so its the interpreted code thats crashing, leaving DD idling.p  pTo avoid people having to manually log on and restart the thing several times a day after the code we have it running crashes or glitches badly, Im trying to set it to where an automatic monitor will check to see if the servers failed, and then close and restart the program.  Because of some specific behaviour in Dream Daemon, I cant use a process.Close call since DD intercepts that and simply minimizes itself to the system tray.  If I process.Kill, I end DD, but that leaves an orphaned notify bar icon left showing.  Im wondering if there is a way for me to then remove that icon programmatically, so my monitor program can clean up after itself.p

Somehow webkit based browser doesnt do a reflow when the outer border is changed. The end result looks ugly  the inner div overflows the outer. Here is the HTML code [div idouter][div idinner styleborder solid blue height 50px][div][div]p  pEvent handler is simple as well  document.getElementByIdouter.setAttributestyle, border solid greenp  pI couldnt believe it when I found this out since its such a trivial reflow task.

There is a timer in silverlight and a UserInitated flag that is used to do the check see a hrefhttpforums.silverlight.netforumsp170071385044.aspx relnofollowsilverlight forumsa.

Negative 34063 pI am looking for a clean, wellbuilt CMS. I want to migrate a number of sites away from a selfbuilt CMS which I will not be developing further.  p  pIve come across a hrefhttpwww.apostrophenow.com relnofollowApostrophea and instantly fell in love with the great, integrated user interface. p  pIt is based on the Symfony framework, which I have practically no experience with.p  pMy questionsp  ul lipI am planning to deploy sites I build with this CMS on shared hosting packages which do not offer any command line access. I know that many of Symfonys development and maintenance functions rely on command line access to the codesymfonycode script. Is it feasible to deploy an Apostrophebased web site to such a web host, or is access to the command line tools required for a live product on a regular basis pli lipTo be very honest, Im not really keen on learning Symfony in depth right now Im sure its a great framework, but I have emtonsem of other obligations. I just really like what Apostrophe offers to the end user of the CMS. In your opinion as a seasoned Symfony or even Apostrope developer, will a professional PHP developer be able to set up a web site without much customization on the code end  lots on the frontend, but thats a different matter without being a Symfony expert Or is this a recipe for disasterpli lipAre there any other arguments that, from your experience, speak for or against using Apostrophe in my situationpli ul

Negative 34063 pI have a little WPF app that draws some dots in a canvas and then tracks mouse moves AFTER a mouseDown happens inside any dot UNTIL a mouseUp on the canvas. My problem is how to prevent the mouseDowns inside the dots from bubbling up to the canvas. I want canvas mouseDown observers to fire when and only when mouseDowns happen emoutsideem the dots, and for dot mouseDown observers to fire when and only when mouseDowns happen inside the dots. p  pHeres my technique for building the observable chain, showing that I set the EventArgs.Handled property in the triggering mouseDown event if the third argument of DownInAndTrackWrtObservable is truep  precodeprivate IObservableltBasedVectorgt DownInAndTrackWrtObservable     UIElement hitTestElement,      UIElement trackWrtElement,     bool handleItP  false      var hitObs  hitTestElement.GetLeftMouseDownObservable      var trackObs  from mDown in hitObs                    let mDownP  mDown.EventArgs.GetPositionhitTestElement                    from mMove in trackWrtElement.GetMouseMoveObservable.

But I dont expect that to happen because of setting the Event.Handled property.

Negative 34063 pSo I have an application that uses a webservice, On the UI side the user picks a table which sends a request across the web to my webservice to return the fields of this table. p  pSo after this request is accomplished I have, on the webservice side a series of Name,Type Pairs that I need to serialize and send back to my client. I could use a Listof String to send the values back but I want to use a Listof CustomClass instead because later I have to do this on a much larger scale and I want to learn on this simpler version.p  pNow I know from my research that I can create a class from an .XSD document so what Im thinking I should do is convert this class into a .XSD and somehow send that with my request to the WebService so that it can use that .XSD to create a class dynamically at runtime, instantiate that class into objects, fill those objects with the result set, bundle it into a strongly typed Listof ReturnFields, serialize that into XML, send it back to my client, Deserialize it back and display it for him.p  pSo 2 questions 1.

Negative 34063 pWeve got a normalish server stack including BlazeDS, Tomcat and Hibernate.p  pWed like to arrange things such that if certain errors especially AssertionError are thrown, the current thread is considered to be in an unknown state and wont be used for further HTTP requests.

Negative 34063 pIn other words, can we model many to many relationships in a persistent data structure efficientlyp  hr  pA pair of unidirectional multimaps was suggested. However, Im not sure how this would work well for removal in a persistent data structure.

Lucene probably wasnt made to do this. We are actually going to do other experiments, but I think I solved the problem with the help of your ideas and some others.

Im gonna mark the question answered with your help Thanks.p

I cant implement back functionality for exa,ple.p  pCan anyone point me in the right direction as to what I should be looking for as a solution to thisp  pEDITp  pSome more informationp  pWithin the TabActivity my first screen will be a ListView that contains 4 rows, then selecting one of these will in turn load another ListView with 2 rows again within the TabActivity and then the 3rd screen will just contain some text depending on which option the user chose again within the Tab Activity.p  pIs a ViewFlipper the best solution here It seems to me that it will require a lot of coding within one Activity if I use the ViewFlipperp

Negative 34063 pLets say I have a table and I want to insert a row. The new rows key may already match an existing rows key in the table, in which case I want to update the existing row. Or, it may not exist in the table, in which case the new row should be inserted. p  pWhat is the most efficient way to perform such an operation I was thinking of first doing a codeSELECTcode perhaps with codeEXISTScode to see if a particular key is present, followed by an codeUPDATEcode if present and an codeINSERTcode if not. You would probably need to keep an codeUPDLOCKcode and a codeHOLDLOCKcode for this combination of statements in order to avoid race conditions, as well. This seems overly complicated and inefficient. p  pI was wondering if there was a more efficient way to do this in SQL Server 2008R2.p

Negative 34063 pFor various maintenance, stability and backup reasons I need to replace a 10 node 10 Linux hosts ocfs2 shared filesystem with something that does not rely on a shared disk. The client applications are PHP in a Linux only environment.p  pRight now each PHP client requests a unique id from the database and creates a file with that idname on the shared disk. The database stores all the file metadata. Existing files are accessed in a similar fashion.p  pI want to replace the shared disk solution with putfileid, tmppath and getfileid, tmppath calls to a file server over the network. Clientside I could work with the files in a tmpfs. The server should handle compression etc. This would also free me of the PHP client dependency and I could use the file server directly from some other applications as well like from Windows Delphi applications.p  pIn theory a FTP based solution could even work, though it would probably not perform very well. Or am I wrong to distrust the old FTP protocolp  pI have over 30 million file ids currently, most of them being a few KB in size with notable exceptions up to 300MB, totalling only 320GB. The PHP client also does some compression and grouping with gzip and tar, its all very clumsy.p  pI was hoping to find something fast and simple like memcachedb but for files. The closest Ive found is hadoops hdfs but I dont think thats quite the correct solution.p  pAny recommendations Something obvious Im missingp

I have been through the a hrefhttpwww.w3.orgTRselectors relnofollowW3 CSS3 selectors documenta a few times, and that has helped me understand how to better use CSS selectors in jQuery, but it has not really helped me understand when one CSS rule will be applied over another.p  pI will show you an example of what I do not understand.p  pI have the following the HTMLp  pre classlanghtml prettyprintoverridecodeltdiv classitemgt     ltagtLink 1ltagt     lta classspecialgtLink 2ltagt ltdivgt codepre  pI have the following CSSp  precode.item a      textdecoration none     color black     fontweight bold     fontsize 1em      .special      textdecoration underline     color red     fontweight normal     fontsize 2em     codepre  pGiven the above, both Link 1 and Link 2 will be styled the same, as determined by the code.item acode CSS.  Why does the style associated with code.specialcode not take precedence for Link 2p  pObviously, I can get around it like thisp  precode.special      textdecoration underline important     color red important     fontweight normal important     fontsize 1em important     codepre  pBut, I feel like that is a hack that I have to sprinkle in due to my lack of understanding.  When I use codeimportantcode I feel a little bit like an addict slipping some small amount of a forbidden substance, telling himself its ok to indulge onelasttime before quitting for good.p  pAdditionally, if I wanted to strongreallystrong learn CSS, are there any excellent books to recommendp
Negative 34063 pI have a very basic question how the creation of HTTPSession works.I know you folks will fire me on looking at this question as similar kind of questions exist.But there is reasoning why i am asking this question Here it is p  pI know httpsession is unique to web browser and server creates it when we do HttpServletRequest.getSession first time.It will maintaintain the same session till we close the browser. But i have little bit different scenario.I Have a web application on one tomcat instance say T1.On welcome page of this web application i have provided two links on click of which takes me to same java servletS1  of different web application hosted on another tomcat instance T2 these two links opens two seperate pop up windows. Now first i click the link1 and inspect the sessionId in S1 and find its value as 1678.  Now first i click the link2 and  inspect the sessionId in S1 and find its value  again as 1678. strongMy question here is why i am getting the same session id for both the requests origintaing from link1 and link2 what can i do to to get the different session for both of these requestsstrongp  pstrongWhat i tried after looking for possible solutions on net strong On click of link1, in Servlet S1 , i copied session attributes, invalidate it and create  new one. Say new session id is 8765 . Now i click the link2 and found the same session  in this request too. So  i further invalidate it and creates new onesay  new session id is 4897. Ideally it should expire the first browser session generated on click of link1. To verify it,i click anywhere on pop up 1 it does not get expired but i see again last generated session id i.e 4897. I am not getting why it attaching the same session id with both pop up windowsp  pstrongFolks Thanks for your patience for taking your time out and read this long scenariostrongp  pstrongEdit strong p  precode      Cookie[] cookies  req.getCookies          ifcookiesnull          for int i  0 i lt cookies.length i            cookies[i].setMaxAge0           context.getResponse.getHttpServletResponse.addCookiecookies[i]                HttpSession myAppSession  req.getSessionline 1 codepre  pAssume on click of link1 i get session id as 1234,then after click of link 2 also i get the same session id.

Negative 34063 pThe standard says that given a declaration of p  precodeinline void foo codepre  pthat codefoocode is an a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma620905382320inline function with emexternalem linkagea because by default all function declarations have external linkage. This strikes me as odd. because the one definition rule section 3.2 in both C03 and C11 sayp  blockquote   p3 ... An inline function shall be defined in every translation unit in which it is used.p      p5 There can be more than one definition of a[n] ... inline function with external linkage 7.1.2 ... Given such an entity named D defined in more than one translation unit ... each definition of D shall consist of the same sequence of tokensp blockquote  pThis means that an inline function might as well have internal linkage, because use of the function in any way through external linkage that is, across translation units would be to invoke undefined behavior by paragraph 3, and that the content of the inline function in all translation units needs to be the same.p  pIs there a backwards compatability or specific toolchain reason for this rulep

Negative 34063 pI want to make a component pretty much like a shopping cart that collects user items and those items can be closed deleted from the shopping cart. p  pFor example, let say a user is asked to give his favorite countries. Hes got an inputText backed with autocomplete that helps him write and find a country name. When he hits enter, the item country name goes into the component cart. And whenever his hangs the mouse over the item in the component, an [X] close sign appears next to the item that permits the removal of the item from the component. There are a lot of free Javascript framework Dojo, jQuery, Kendo UI, etc.. that handle the autocomplete part but apparently none of them handles the closeable item in cart functionality.p  pDo you know any good free JS framework that offers this functionalityp  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 34063 pIm trying to implement .NET 4 helperutility class which should retrieve HTML page sources based on the url list for webtesting tool. The solution should be scalable and have high performance.p  pI have been researching and trying different solutions already many days, but cannot find out proper solution.p  pBased on my understanding best way to achieve my goal would be to use asynchronous webrequests running parallel using TPL.p  pIn order to have full control to headers etc. Im  using HttpWebResponse instead of WebClient which is wrapping HttpWebResponse. In some cases the output should be chained to other tasks thus using TPL tasks could make sense.p  pWhat I have achieved so far after many different trialsapproaches,p  ol lipImplemented basic synchronous, asynchronous APM and parallel using TPL tasks solutions to see performance level of different solutions.pli lipTo see the performance of asynchrounous parallel solution I used APM approach, BeginGetResponse and BeginRead, and run it in Parallel.ForEach. Everything works fine and Im happy with the performance. Somehow I feel that using simple Parallel.ForEach is not the way to go and for example I dont know how would I use task chaining.pli lipThen I tried more sophisticated system using tasks for wrapping the APM solution by using TaskCompletionSource and iterator to iterate through the APM flow. I believe that this solution could be what Im looking for, but there is a strange delay, something between 610s, which happens 23 times when running 500 urls list. p  pBased on the logs the execution has went back to the thread which is calling async fetch in a loop when the delay happens. The delay doesnt happen always when execution moves back to the loop, just 23 times, other times it works fine. It looks like that the looping thread would create a set of tasks those would be processed by other threads and while mostall tasks are completed there would be delay 68s before the loop continues creating remaining tasks and other threads are active again.pli ol  pThe principle of iterator inside loop isp  precodeIEnumerableltTaskgt DoExamplestring input            var aResult  DoAAsyncinput      yield return aResult      var bResult  DoBAsyncaResult.Result      yield return bResult      var cResult  DoCAsyncbResult.Result      yield return cResult              Task t  IterateDoExample42 codepre  pIm resolving the connection limit by using System.Net.ServicePointManager.DefaultConnectionLimit and timeout using ThreadPool.RegisterWaitForSingleObjectp  pMy question is simply, what would be the best approach to implement helperutility class for retrieving html pages which wouldp  ul libe scalable and have high performanceli liuse webrequestsli libe easily chained to other tasksli libe able to use timeoutli liuse .NET 4 frameworkli ul  pIf you think that the solution of using APM, TaskCompletionSource and iterator, which I presented above, is fine I would appreciate any help for trying to solve the delay problem. p  pIm totally new to C and Windows development so please dont mind if something what Im trying out doesnt make too much sense.p  pAny help would be highly appreciated as without getting this solved I have to drop my test tool development.p  pThanksp
Negative 34063 pI have a WCF serviceclient pair. We have been relying on calling Open on the clients factory method to make sure that the service is available before we make any call. Something likep  precodeMyClient GetClient       MyClient client  new MyClient     try              client.Open         return client          catchException              perform an important errorhandling here       codepre  pIn this way, the caller codes will just do something likep  precodeclient  factory.GetClient client.CallMethodInTheService codepre  pand they dont need to worry about error handling.p  pThis works when we set security mode to Windows and  clientCredentialType to Windows in the wshttpbinding. client.Open will throw an exception when service is unavailable, so the error handling code will get executed. However, now we are deploying in an environment where we cannot use Windows credential based security, so we set security mode to none. However, this cause client.Open no longer throws an exception when the service is unavailable, and we have some problem because we rely on this code in the catch block of the factory.p  pWhat is the reason that Open throws an exception when we use message security but not when we disable the security How can we perform similar availability checking if security is set to none I dont think its a good solution to put a try catch with error handling on each individual call. Is there another way for the factory method to check the availability of the service before returning the client objectp

She is a Humanities Scholar doublemajoring in cultural anthropology and biology who has shined in both fields. Mary Beth has sought out a range of research opportunities at UMBC, gaining early experience in UMBCs Ecology and Evolution Lab. This prepared her for more independent research at the National Institutes of Health. She later completed archaeological field and lab work at colonial and prehistoric American Indian sites in southern Maryland. Mary Beth creatively wove together her interests in cultural anthropology and biology through study abroad at the University of Kent in Canterbury, England, where she completed human osteology coursework to prepare for graduate school. She has been awarded a fellowship for the biological anthropology Ph.D. program at The Ohio State University, which focuses on the history and patterns of disease as discerned through skeletal remains. In addition to pursuing an academic career, Mary Beth hopes to assist military and archaeological groups on postconflict skeletal recovery. Mary Beth has given back to her community by helping with local speech and debate tournaments for homeschooled teens tutoring students in chemistry, math and SAT preparation and participating in Scholar Selection Day and other prospective student events at UMBC.ltpgt  ltpgtltemgtAt prospective student events I attended, Dr. Hrabowski promised that as long as we worked hard to pursue our dreams, UMBC would do everything possible to transform our efforts into our successes. Throughout my four years, I have seen this university fulfill and exceed that promise in every way possible. The anthropology department, despite its small size, has recruited some of the most intelligent, insightful and encouraging minds in the country. My mentors there provided the education, guidance and endless recommendations that pointed me towards my dream of becoming a biological anthropologist. The biology department provided the coursework and experience that I needed to secure lab experience at UMBC and then NIH. Without these stepping stones to my NIH internship, I would not have discovered the bone histology that I hope to pursue in my doctoral program. ltemgt ltpgt  ltpgtltiframe width530 height298 srchttpwww.youtube.comembedWG4B9e7A5pA frameborder0 allowfullscreengtltiframegt ltpgt         ltligt            ltli stylebackgroundcolorFFCgt         ltdiv classpic idRWardlowgt          ltltimg srcimagesphotosRobertWardlow.jpg width240 altRobert Wardlow, Salutatorian gt         ltdivgt         lth3gtRobert  Douglass Wardlow IIlth3gt ltp stylecolor333gtltstronggtPlans M.D.Ph.D., Johns Hopkins Universityltstronggtltbrgt B.S., Biochemistry amp Molecular Biologyltbrgt ltemgtSumma Cum Laudeltemgtltbrgt Hometown Cherry Hill, New Jerseyltpgt  ltpgtAs the salutatorian of the class of 2012, Robert Wardlows career at UMBC has been full of accomplishments. A Meyerhoff Scholar, Barry M. Goldwater Scholar, Howard Hughes Medical Institute Scholar and Rhodes Scholarship finalist, he has presented his research at 12 conferences and symposia, earning numerous awards. Roberts research focuses on chemical signaling of heart cells and the potential of certain stem cells for providing therapeutic benefits for damaged cells. Excellence in scholarship is intimately connected to community service for Robert. He cofounded the student group Men Achieving Leadership, Excellence and Success MALES to promote community activism, leadership and academic excellence. Roberts accomplishments have earned him admission into the Phi Beta Kappa, Phi Kappa Phi and Golden Key International honor societies, and he received the HHMI Gilliam Fellowship for Advanced Study.ltpgt  ltpgtltemgtUMBC has provided an environment rich in resources that has helped me to develop to a level far beyond what I could have originally expected. I was able to display tremendous personal growth over the course of my time here both academically and socially. Courses were challenging, but the school offered more than enough support in terms of tutoring and advising to help me best deal with the load. I had numerous chances to further my research career by gaining experience in research labs both in the area and around the country. I have made friends here that will hopefully last long in to the future as well as meeting mentors that will continue to guide me in the right direction.

Negative 34063 pNot sure what to search for when solving this puzzle.  Not asking for the world... just direction unless youre feeling generous.  This is going to be terribly hard to expain.p  pMy website has dropdown menus with measurements.  When selecting width x height dropdowns, it checks database for price.

So I just pulled the measurements from a query loop into my  list...  and voila it matches and echos a price.. but..p  pNow Im finding out that the measurements listed will need to be in 1 increments. So, I only have a database with specific measurements but I need the entire measurement range.p  pDo I really have to go into the DATABASE and manually enter the SAME price for 24, 25, 26, 27... and SAME price for 28, 29, 30, 31, ... and do this time hundreds of products  p  pOr is there a SQL trick that allows me to select the minimum and maximum measurement, list them in a dropdown, then match one of those 1 increment measurements that isnt exactly what the DATABASE says... but is between for example 24 and 28.  p  pHope this isnt too confusing and THANK YOU.  p  pThanks to Gordon this was much easier than anticipated.

Negative 34063 pI have set up a midi input port in my code and have attached a call back for reading midi data received. That is all working fine. I am reading Midi Timecode and parsing it in my call back. What I have noticed is that depending on when I start my application, I could be as late as 1 second from the device that is transmitting the MTC. Sometimes it is a frame behind. Regardless, it is inconsistent and frustrating. I am not doing any blocking or ObjC calls in my readProc. I have even gone to the trouble of disconnecting my usb midi device after running my application to see if there is any weird IOKit stuff going on.

Negative 34063 pI have a DLL used in a compliance scenario the details of which are irrelevant.  The important point is that the main executeable must display the DLL version number.  My solution was that the DLL has a function to return its own version  ie obtain it from the its own version resource and return it as a string.p  pMy reviewer says that the main program should work out the DLL version number.  He even gave me some code to get the DLL module handle and extract the version using that.p  pMy question is, which is a better design and why  My feeling is that, using OO principles, I should ask the DLL for its version number.  Doing it the other way means that the main program needs to know how the version information is stored and is hence more tightly coupled to the implementation.p  pNote that I know exactly how to extract the version information from a DLL.  My question is about the best place for the code that does this.p

Does this mean android no longer caches cellwifi location fixes Or does it simply mean nobody has been able to create a similiar type of app for ICS or nobody can figure out where the cache is stored anymorep  pAssuming there is a cache stored locally on the device, then when a network provided location is requested, is the location returned by android retrieved via the local cache or  is it a fresh one from the network How do I know if its new or from the cachep  pLastly, how much network data do network provided locations with wifi radio enabledon and data connectivity on actually usep  pThanks, Domp

We use TDDium for CI, and I want to try to continue running in random on the CI server, but ensure that specific spec files run in order.p  h2Questionh2  pIs there any way to specify, on a file by file basis, that RSpec should run that file in default order I see that there seems to be a hrefhttpsgithub.comrspecrspeccoreissues547 relnofollowsome customized ordering strategy support merged into rspeccorea, but that doesnt seem to be fully baked and Im not sure it supports codebefore allcode, Im still trying to wrap my head around it.p  h2Discussionh2  pAnd, since there is a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10321166runrspectasksinaspecificorderanother questiona about this that has downvoted because specs should be independent let me state my usecase to try to preemptively avoid the you shouldnt do that argument.p  pWe have a complex model where various aspects of the system state changes over time. I have an analytics system that is watching that system to track the state change of various things over time. Thanks to the a hrefhttpsgithub.comtravisjefferytimecop relnofollowTimecop gema, I can go back in time, create a bunch of interacting models, then step through, say, 5 days and look at the system as seen by the analytics system, given known conditions, at each day. Specifically, to make sure that some calculations are correct given the assumption embedded in the system.p  pNow, I realize that I could have 5 separate describe blocks, each with goes through the process of setting up individual conditions for each of 5 days in history, but it made much more sense to me to step through time and watch the condition change while in that state. More efficient and more connected to what is actually happening in the system. I understand that I can mock various responses here and there, and we do that, but Im interested in stepping through a realtime interaction between the base system and analytics system.p

Id have expected that at some point, affecting bytes from one core may not have reflected on the cached content from the other core.

Pretty much the chatbot module is to allow users to create bots in wikis on Wikia, a company that allows wikis to be created which anyone can edit. On a wiki there is a chat extension where users can talk to. This script allows a bot to join the chat and do commands. onmessage goes off when someone posts something in the Chat.p  pSo this printsp  precode Traceback most recent call last   File file.py, line 146, in ltmodulegt     bot.start   File LibraryPython2.7sitepackageschatbot.py, line 371, in start     self.onmessageself.c, e   File file.py, line 12, in onmessage     print haveamessage UnboundLocalError local variable haveamessage referenced before assignment codepre  hr  pId like to clarify that the reason this isnt producing an error for all of you is because you are not in a Wikia chat. the function onmessage only runs when someone posts something in the Chat. For example, I may havep  precodedef onmessageself, c, e     if e.text  hello  e.text is what a user posts in the chat. e  event         c.sendHello  c.send simply sends back a message in the chat. c  connection codepre  pSo when someone posts in chat hello, the Bot posts back Hellop

Negative 34063 pI am currently trying to build a custom button control for a dice game I am writing in WPF. Everything is working correctly except that the image in the UI while it is running does not change when the  the die value has changed. I can confirm through my debug sessions that the image source is changing as expected as well as all values are changing as expected but the image just doesnt  seem to want to update.  Ive tried looking over many similar questions but none of the questions seem to apply to my particular situation it would seem.

Negative 34063 pI have a windows 2008 server with Coldfusion 9 installed. I have an application that submits a form, and upon submit gets the 500 Internal Server Error page. I have checked the logs and nothing is logged there. I have heard about the issue with submitting over 100 form fields, but my form submits 64, max. I have Enable Robust Exception Information checked with my IP address added and HTTP status codes unchecked. I can see all the debugging information on all pages up to the error page. I have output to a file all the information the page puts into the form fields and created a page with just those form fields and those values and it submits fine.

However, although I believe I followed all the instructions to install it and checked if the library paths are correct, I keep getting these errorsp  blockquote   pmodwebsocket.obj  error LNK2019 unresolved external symbol   impaprthreadmutexcreate referenced in function modwebsocketmethodhandlerp blockquote  pand similar other lines like that.p  pIS there anybody knows why I get these errorsp  pAnd actually, I have checked other websocketplugins and they seem to me that they were introduced to be used in unix machines mostly, I couldnt find much about Windows 7. If you have any other suggestions, including how to install and start to use them, would be appreciated, Thanks,p

Negative 34063 pI have a process flow diagram that uses various excel shapes to visually represent a data production process from start to finish, I.e. from data input to analytic environment to data output to submission file.  I have used vba to hyperlink many of the shapes in the diagram to another sheet in the workbook using thisworkbook.fullname that contains definitions for abbreviations contained in the text of each shape, eg C1 is listed in a shape, the hyperlink takes you to the definition tab cell where C1 is defined as control point one.  The hyperlinks work when the xlsm workbook is in my home location where i saved the file but they do not work if I save the file to another location they try to open my original workbook.  Is it as easy as changing the hyperlink addresses to thisworkbook.filename and dropping the path to make this work do i need to create a macro that will automatically look up the old hyperlink address and replace it with the new address of current file location for every shape in the workbook containing a hyperlink. The path could change in the future, so want it to be relative and not fixed  for example if I save the file to share point and another user saves a copy to their home directory, I still want the links to work for them in either location. Some hyperlinks go to sheet1 some to sheet2 for example, but sheets 1 amp 2 are both located in the same workbook. Please helpp
Negative 34063 pSo I was just archiving an assignment for email submission, and was asked by the instructor to do so using the tar command and create a .tgz file, which I did with the following command line scriptp  precodetar cvf filename.tgz main.cpp other filenames here codepre  pNo problems on the archive or anything, but when I went to email the file, gmail prevented me saying that my file contained an executable Im assuming main.cpp, and that this was not allowed for security reasons.p  pSo, I ran the same script, but this time created a .tar file instead, like sop  precodetar cvf filename.tar main.cpp filenames here codepre  pAgain, archives just fine, but now gmail is fine with me emailing the archive.

Its more academic than anything as I know running a production server at your house is a ridiculous idea.p  pIm running a development server LAMP at my home but my ISP blocks port 80.  The DNS for my domain is set up to URL Redirect to my IP and port number.  My router is portforwarding to my server, and I have Apache set up so its listening on port 8081.p  pThe issue is that when you access the domain, the URL in the browser is resolved from my domain name to the IP and port number, and is displayed as such.  strongFor example, you type www.banana.com into the browser, the site is displayed but now the URL is shown as 12.23.456.118081.strongp  pIs there any way to fix this so that the domain name does not become IP and port numberp  pCan you use Apache proxy functionality somehowp  pCould you use modrewrite to change the IP and port number back to the domain namep  pThanks in advancep

Negative 34063 pI am messing around with CSS transitions and am having difficulty getting the effect I want.p  pMy idea was to have some text be the same color as the background effectively making it invisible, I was then going to position an image over the text, and use a translation to move the image from left to right. I was then going to sync up the transitions so that as the image passed over a character in the text, that character would be fading in. Effectively making it seem as if the image was uncovering the text.p  pThe image translates fine, and the text does in fact fade in. Its just that the text fades in all at once.

Negative 34063 pI am using C, Breeze and Durandal to create an SPA but this question relates to more than SPAs. Often times you have entities that you want to create and also edit. Take this simple entityp  precodeclass Entity     [Key]    public int Id    [Required]    public String FirstName    [Required]    public String LastName  codepre  pNow you need to create a create and an edit form for this entity  100 other entities. The simple way is to create two forms one for each function. However, these forms will be almost exact duplicates.p  pIf no fields were required you when someone clicks Create you could create the entity in the db and redirect them to editid. However you want to use the automatic validation generated by the annotations for users who Save edits.p  pWhat is a good way to reduce duplication of the form html and backend code Simply having two view models sharing the same view might be good enough but I am not sure how to do that with durandal.p

Negative 34063 pI can achieve my objective on MacOSX using applescript which installs a textlike file and then inserts a few lines of text into the programs settings file in the same folder. Final window has a launch option for the main program. For Windows, Inno Setup installs the file and then installs a second file which replaces the settings file in the users program appdata settings folder as recommended by the program developer. This is fine for new users but experienced users will not want their main settings file replaced.p  pMy objective is to replicate the Mac process. Only way I know is to use a batch file works on Win XP and 8 to insert the text into the settings file already on disk. AFAIK the batch file needs to be in same folder. Thus, the installer installs the initial file, then the batch file. This batch exe file needs to be run and I want to find a method of deleting the batch file immediately after. Then the process is finished and proceed to final Inno Setup window. Is this possible and if so, how Some sample code would be ideal if possible.p  pIf there is a better approach than using a batch file, then that might be a better solution so theres no need to delete any files.p  pIve learnt a lot about using Inno Setup via StackOverflow over the past year but cannot find a solution to the above. This is a community project.p
Negative 34063 pI was working on another project using the CodeIgniter framework, which had a main controller file that built all of the pages on the site. p  pEntering a url such as domain.comabout would run function about in the controller file, which loaded in the various components of that page.p  pMost of the magic of this was handled by either CodeIgniter, or the other project members, so I am unsure exactly how that happens.p  pI am looking to achieve the same thing, without the use of any frameworks, and am at a complete loss of how to accomplish it. I know that it would be possible for me to have a url somewhere along the lines of domain.comloadabout, and use this to run that function, but I want the URL to be clean, and easy for visitors to type in.p  pSo, my question is.. How can I set up my website so that it always points to a single file, controller.php, and then runs a function which matches what is input in the URL, AND have that URL not direct me away from the controller page That is to say, if I type in domain.comabout I dont want to get taken to an about.php pagep  pI apologize in advance if this question is hard to understand, or if I am taking the wrong approach to anything. Also for the lack of examples and descriptions.. I just really dont know enough to be any more specific.

This just isnt as elegant.p  pNote I am writing this in PHP.p  pemAside why does replacing codescode with codebcode in the expression above not seem to workemp  hr  pETAp  pThanks everyonep  pThis is what I eventually ended up with, based on Explosion Pillss advicep  precodefunction addlinks string       function replace arr           if  strncmp http, arr[1], 4  0               return lta hrefarr[1]gtarr[1]ltagtarr[2]arr[3]          else              return lta href . http . arr[1] . gtarr[1]ltagtarr[2]arr[3]               return pregreplacecallback bhttpwww.[pP]sx, replace, string   codepre  pI added a callback so that all of the links would start with http, and did some fiddling with the way it handles punctuation.p  pIts probably not the Best way to do things, but it works. Ive learned a lot about this in the last little while, but there is still more to learnp

Negative 34063 pI have been in charge for the past 5 years of the development and the maintenance of a GWT project which consists of 6 different WebApps. The project is using GWT 1.5 and is built with ant for either mode devwar. These webapps are deployed on apachetomcat, the production site run version 5.5 whereas we run for testing version 7.0. p  pTo emphasize user experience, I would like to migrate the GWT version to a more recent one of which I have no idea so far I have read many things about migrating, regarding deprecated APIs, improvments made frome one version to another and I have still structural questions dealing with the new project layout itself.p  pCurrently, the layout is the following p  precodeWebXXX  src  net.yyy.webxxx    common     client     server     public     Common.gwt.xml    module1     client     server     public     module1.gwt.xml    [...] test build  build.xml  buildModule1.xml  [..] DependenciesSVNExternals www compileallmodules.xml compilemodule1.xml WebXXXHosted.xml [..] codepre  pTo explicit things a bit, the fodler Dependencies is a placeholder for linking Workspace sources with an external widgets library. This library is built at compile time when building all modules or just one within an ant task and the resulting jar is injected into the module WEBINFlib directory. That widget library does use gxt.1.1.1 and gwtincubator 1.5.p  pOver the years, writing a new ant task for each new WebApp seemed to be the solution but now that we are also using maven, I am wondering if I must convert the project to a maven project before doing the migration or if I can skip, for now, the maven conversion. p  pSince I guess maven is not absolutely required and since the project includes several customized ant tasks to have it run in dev mode, I am also wondering if I could instead migrate the related GWT jars in a version which is such that I wont have to rewrite all the UI though I know I will have major replacement to do and extensive tests to run. p  pFeel free to enlighten me about the way I could go maven or not, the version of gwt I should migrate to, the related gxt version if its still relevant to use because I am in complete darkness p  pThanks for all, Cheers p

Negative 34063 pJust a few questions to clarify some confusing factors for me.p  pAbout application.jsp  ol licoderequiretree .code will recursively include all the js files within codeappassetsjavascriptscode. If I put a javascript file in codeappassetsjavascriptssubfoldercode, it will be included. If I just want to include a specific directory, I should use coderequiredirectorycodeli licodelibassetsjavascriptscode and codevendorassetsjavascriptscode can be referenced from the manifest, codeapplication.jscode. Their javascript files WILL NOT be precompiled unless they are stated in the manifest.li liWhen I install a gem that requires a set of javascriptse.g. bootstrap I require the related javascripts files in the manifest too e.g. code require bootstrapcode. The javascript files live in the Gem path, and they can be referenced by relative paths too.li ol  pAre my statements all truep
Negative 34063 pFirst, I am trying to crash course javascript, so please note I am still limited in my understanding of its syntax. p  pI need to create a table of 28 random colors, and then update it with each click of a button. I would like to create the table on the same page as the button, but I can only seem to get this to work when using document.write, which then writes to a new page with the table.p  pAny help cleaning up my code would be appreciated.

The authenticationtoken generation method is called via the web service, but everything else is called directly from the web app.  Our DBA is concerned that this is insecure and wants all database access to occur in a web service as well Im not in much of a position to question whether this concernsolution is valid in the first place, but if anyone can elaborate on why it is or isnt please do.p  pI am armed with VS2012 and this is my task.  My research has steered me to WCF, and Ive already created a test web service, and a test web app that successfully consumes it.p
Negative 34063 pC doesnt have a way to get the string representation of an enum. People get around this by writing custom functions that contain a lot of boilerplate code akabr  codeswitchcode with codecase XYZ return XYZcodep  pThat of course requires users of the enum to know the name of the custom function.p  pSo I thought I could just add a specialization to codestdtostringcode to enable a user to use codetostringcode on my enums. Something like thisp  precode include ltiostreamgt include ltstringgt include ltcassertgt define TEST class Car  public     enum class Color              Red,         Blue,         White       ifdef TEST include ltstringgt namespace std      stdstring tostring CarColor c              switch c                  case CarColorRed             return Red         case CarColorBlue             return Blue         case CarColorWhite             return White         default                              assert0                 return                               endif int main      stdcout ltlt stdtostringCarColorWhite ltlt stdendl   codepre  pAre there any problems with this solutionp

Negative 34063 pIm exploring location services, and my iOS Simulator on Xcode 4.6 is showing the wrong latitude and longitude. Ive done this in two ways, with CLLocation manager instance, and with using HTML5 Geolocation and Cordova. The same javascript works perfectly on a web browser, but not from the simulator. I get the same wrong coordinates using the CLLocation manager as well. Is this a problem with the simulator, and how can I fix itp

Negative 34063 pIm trying to reverse a string in C. The reverse function simply assigns the character at a given location in a for loop to a temp object. I cannot see any logic errors within the program, and the program compile successfully under gcc 4.7.2 with this commandp  precodegcc Wall stdc99 reverse.c codepre  pTo recreate the problem p  p1. Run the program and enter a string into your shellp  p2. Once finished inputting, press enterand or your EOF signal. p  pThe problem is that neither the original string is printed, or the reversed string. This is also an exercise from KampR second edition, if you have completed this exercise, a different solution to mine would be appreciated. p  pI think the bug is caused by the absence of a null character, the famous printf requires a null terminated string to print input to cin.

Negative 34063 pIve purchased a Foscam FI8910W IP webcam which outputs a live video stream in MJPEG format, and Im trying to embed the live stream in a webpage.p  pIve already accomplished this goal by simply using the camera feeds URL as the source for an HTML img tag. The problem with this is that each browser session accessing this page connects to the camera, so the limited bandwidth that the camera has is quickly used up, so no more than 2 or 3 users can view the page at the same time.p  pWhat I would like to do is set up some sort of streaming server to access the cameras feed directly, and reproduceprocess it in some way so that when users browse to my site they are pulling from the server rather than the camera.p  pIdeally this would be done without the need for any browser plugins, and would work across any browser. Im pretty experienced in several programming languages, so writing something to handle this is not totally out of the question, I just dont have the slightest idea how to get started. p

Negative 34063 pIm trying to test a directive using Karma and Jasmine that does a couple of things. First being that it uses a templateUrl and second that it defines a controller. This may not be the correct terminology, but it creates a controller in its declaration. The Angular application is set up so that each unit is contained within its own module. For example, all directives are included within module app.directive, all controllers are contained within app.controller, and all services are contained within app.service etc. p  pTo complicate things further, the controller being defined within this directive has a single dependency and it contains a function that makes an http request to set a value on the scope. I know that I can mock this dependency using httpBackend mock to simulate the http call and return the proper object to the call of this function. Ive done this numerous times on the other unit tests that Ive created, and have a pretty good grasp on this concept.p  pemThe code below is written in CoffeeScript.emp  pstrongHere is my directivestrongp  precode    angular.moduleapp.directive       .directive exampleDirective, [ gt         restrict A         templateUrl partialsview.html         scope true         controller [scope, Service, scope, Service gt           scope.model             scope.model.valueone  1             Call the dependency           Service.getValue             .success data gt               scope.model.valuetwo  data             .error gt               scope.model.valuetwo  0         ]       ] codepre  pstrongHere is the dependency servicestrongp  precode    angular.moduleapp.service       .factory Service, [http, http gt        getValue  gt         options.method  GET         options.url  examplefetch          http .defaultsoptions codepre  pstrongHere is the viewstrongp  precode    ltdivgt       model.valueone model.valuetwo     ltdivgt codepre  pIve simplified this quite a bit, as my goal is only to understand how to wire this up, I can take it from there.

Negative 34063 pI have created a simple python application to detect changes in a set of words. Now I need an executable file of my script. Since I use python 3.3 the only way I found was using cxFreeze. I have created my setup file according to the documentation presented by cxFreeze website, and it seems to work. The thing is while it is creating the files in the bin folder python.exe crashes, there is only a windows error saying python.exe stopped working. In the lines printed to command prompt I can see that the crash has occurred after copying python33.dll. This I can confirm by comparing the copied file and the original file. Still, an exe file is created which also crashes when I run it. Tracing it, I found out that the exe file crashes when it tries to get a zipimporter instance, giving the error cannot get zipimporter instance. I have a windows 7 64 bit, python 3.3.2 64 bit, and cxFreeze 4.3.1 64 bit. I also have a windows 7 32 bit on a virtual machine with python 3.3.2 32 bit and cxFreeze 4.3.1 32 bit. To my knowledge both Linux and windows users have this problem but only Linux users seem to have a solution Maybe I didnt find the solution to my problem, but I have spent two days looking. I would be really grateful if you can help.p

Negative 34063 pI know there are quite a few questions and other webpages explaining the difference between shadowing and overriding.

Negative 34063 pIn a a hrefhttpsgithub.comptaoussanistimbreblobmastersrctaoenssotimbreprofiling.clj relnofollowclojure profiling librarya, there is a an atom storing some profiling information and it is modified by a number of functions.  In the comments, they assert that the summary statistics one of the functions is called last for efficiency purposes, but I could not see how this was enforced in the actual code.p  pI then noticed that one manner in which this could enforced is the ordering in the construction of a map, so I recreated a simpler example to demonstrate.p  precodedefn t []   let [a atom ]     b swap a assoc  data ishere      c keys a codepre  pHere, in agreement with the comment, which one of b or c comes first in the code will determine the value of a.  Of course there must be some ordering, but is this behaviour guaranteed  It seems like it should not be, since an unordered hash has no ordering, and this could have detrimental implications for parallelism.p

Negative 34063 pI have a FrameLayout with four SurfaceViews arranged in a 2x2 grid. The user can resize each of the views.p  pId like the views to be drawn in order of their area, with the largest view drawn first and so on. Each time a view is resized, I order the views by their area, and update the FrameLayoutp  precodepublic void reorderViews          PlotView child1         PlotView child2         boolean swap  false          forint i  0 i lt layout.getChildCount i              child1  PlotView layout.getChildAti             forint j  i  1 j lt layout.getChildCount j                  child2  PlotView layout.getChildAtj                 ifchild1.area lt child2.area                      layout.removeViewAtj                     layout.addViewchild2, i                                              codepre  pThis works, in the sense that the FrameLayouts children array holds the views in the correct order. But after reordering, the views continue to draw in their original order i.e. the order in which they were originally added. p  pIve tried requesting layout on the FrameLayout, on the individual child views, on the FrameLayouts parent view. Ive also tried invalidating everything. Ive overridden the FrameLayouts onDraw hoping to force the correct draw order. No go.p  pA few points Im using FrameLayout rather than Grid because Id like larger views to obscure smaller views, instead of having a larger view push a smaller view aside, as is the behaviour in GridView.p  pIn order to position the child views properly, I adjust their margins and set their gravity to top it doesnt seem to matter what value I use for gravity, just so long as gravity is set to something, margins work.  Might the gravity be the issuep  pAlso, Im sure theres a more efficient way to reorder the views, but theres only four total, so this works ok. p

Negative 34063 pConsider that the sequental version of the program already exists and implements a sequence of  readcomputewrite operations on a single input file and other single output file. Read and write operations are performed by the 3rdparty library functions which are hard but possible to modify, while the compute function is performed by the program itself. Readwrite library functions seems to be not threadsafe, since they operate with internal flags and internal memory buffers.p  pIt was discovered that the program is CPUbounded, and it is planned to improve the program by taking advantage of multiple CPUs up to 80 by designing the multiprocessor version of the program and using codeOpenMPcode for that purpose. The idea is to instantiate multiple compute functions with same single input and single output.p  pIt is obvious that something nedds to be done in insuring the consistent access to reads, data transfers, computations and data storages. Possible solutions are hard rewrite the IO library functions in threadsafe manner, moderate write a threadsafe wrapper for IO functions that would also serve as a data cacher.p  pIs there any general patterns that cover the subject of converting, wrapping or rewriting the singlethreaded code to comply with codeOpenMPcode threadsafety assumptionsp  pEDIT1 The program is fresh enough for changes to make it multithreaded or, generally a parallel one, implemented either by multithreading, multiprocessing or other ways.p

Negative 34063 pI have an existing class, which contains properties similar to this onep  precodeprivate int someprop  6  [DisplayName  SomeDisplayName, Order  0, Description  Description, GroupNameGroupName] [GridCategoryParameters] public int SomeProp  get  return someprop   set  someprop  value   codepre  pI would like to have all of these properties displayed in a PropertyGrid, with the addition of a subcategory class for each one, which contains 3 properties  min, max and step numeric values. Having a subcategory class with boolean and enum values will also be great. The issue is that the original class, which contains the SomeProp property should not be changed in any way, since it is referenced directly from another program. The other requirement of this scenario is that all of the subcategory properties should also be accessible.p  pThis is a screenshot of the expected resultp  pa hrefhttpimg542.imageshack.usimg5425862hfox.png relnofollowhttpimg542.imageshack.usimg5425862hfox.pngap  pIs there any way to achieve this p  pstrongEditstrongp  pThe idea is to set the values from the property grid. The scenario is the following I have a property grid with list of parameters. Lets say that the parameter is of type int. I would like to be able to optimize this parameter. This means that the user should be able to input a start value min, end value max and a step value to the main property grid. From there I need to retrieve the user input values for min, max and step, and create a list of variations. p  pAn example will be If the user inputs min  10, max  20, step  2, then I should be able to retrieve those values in the code behind and create a list of possible inputs for the main property which will be 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20. Then using this list I can make the optimization logic. p  pThe initializing values of min, max and step should be as follows min  main property default value, max  main property default value, step  1. So basically all values will be coming from the main property default value which is 6 in the code snippet. From there user should be able to change the min, max and step properties. In that case I do not care if the user is able to change the main property 6 or not, since I will need all the variations between min, max with the particular step.p

Negative 34063 pI am testing a web application which needs to refresh one of the header elements every 5 seconds.

But, when I run this on IE 9 it still behaves the same and endlessly wait for page to load or wait for that AJAX call to finish. And, if I stop the browser calls by pressing Esc or x link, my script continues for that page and hangs again for next page.p  pAny idea, why IE 9 doesnt work as IE 8 does for page load Is there a way I can debug thisp  pPS I tried updating IEDriverServer but in vain.

If I update a record in Management Studio, the changes arent reflected in my running solution either.p  pIf I then stop and restart, or even just stop and do a build CTRL, SHIFT, B in VS, my data in the web application all reverts back to the state matching that of my database through Management Studio.p  pIf I add a trace to the database, I can see reads, but no writes coming through to the db.  Additionally, if I stop the SQLExpress service, my pages throw SQL Server service has been pausedstopped exceptions.  So bizarrely enough, it looks like its reading from the correct database, but may be writing to a development cache somewherep  pThis leads me to think that on every build, a copy of the db is being used for that debugrun sessions state.p  pSo the question then becomes, where is this being set, and where is the temp db living  I have scoured my web.config, web.debug.config, web.release.config, but there is no reference to an alternate database.p  pI have looked in the AppData and bin folders, but theres no extra database there either.

Negative 34063 pI am at long last at the very end of a VOD project. It works perfectly, except on Android. Basically, on Android video will not play until the entire video has downloaded. A media server was well out of scope, so we are just serving the videos up from AWS S3. Works fantastically on iOS. Both streaming and downloading the video works exactly as you would expect it to.  On Android, it just doesnt seem to want to play before the download finishes. It works well when using a server on the local network I even see the occasional buffer, so I know its not just quickly downloading, but nothing remote. p  pMy only guess is that it is to do with the differences in the way iOS and Android stream video. On iOS, video streams via byterange requests. Every few seconds, it will time itself out and request another range of bytes for the file. On Android, it only sends a single request for the entire file. Not sure how that could be fixed, however.p  pDoes anyone have any tips or pointers here Any help would be greatly appreciated here.p  ul liHappens on Android 4.4 and 4.3. li liUsing both a remote prod server we own and AWS S3. li liAIR 3.9 with Flex 4.11li liUtilizing codeStageVideocode and codeNetStreamcodeli liTest devices are a Nexus 5 and a Nexus 4li ul

When a portlet B receive the event, it must build an URL, connect to it and read data from it, and display the result.p  pMy B portlet is based on MVCPortlet, is instanceable, ajaxable and with a renderweight of 0, for having a parallel processing and displaying of all instances of portlet B.p  pBut it does not work wellp  p1 I could not do the processing of the URL in the event processing, as all events reception one per instance of my portlet B  are processed in the same thread. So in the event I just set a renderRequest parameter, so the jsp page automatically use an ActionURL to call the action processing in my portlet.p  pThis action builds the URL, use it, process the data, and redirect to the result display page response.setRenderParameterjspPage, htmldisplayresults.jsp.p  p2 I was expecting each portlet to be independent from the other, but they are not. There is only one instance of the MVCPortlet, shared by all portlets, that greatly surprised me. The portlet session is also shared by all my instances of portlet. The action method is executed by different thread, that is good, but the rendering of portlets can be blocked by actions processing of other portlets. One portlet can provoke the whole page refresh. All things that I wanted to avoid by having instanceable, ajaxable and renderweight with 0...p  pI wonder if there is something wrong, if it is normal to have only one instance of the class extending MVCPortlet, etc. Or if there is a best way to have the desired behavior.p

Negative 34063 pIm building a website for a voluntary group to support dyslexiarelated learning difficulties and one of their aids is to change the text from plain black and white to multicoloured, so that every nth character for example, the colour changes to a contrasting one.p  pAn example can be seen at a hrefhttpwww.joomtrax.comindex.phpjoomlaplugincolorize relnofollowColorise pluginap  p[colorize] To change any text from plain to colorised, I have to edit the article and add the html tags like so.

Negative 34063 pIm using a hrefhttpsgithub.comd11wtqwhittle relnofollowwhittlea to parse a grammar, but Im running into the classical a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiLALRparserLRparsers relnofollowLALR ambiguity problema.

Negative 34063 pI have 2 vectors of length n, the first one is composed by integers and the second one by reals between 0 and 1. Esp  precode a  [6 2 5 3] and b  [0.1 0.2 0.04 1] codepre  pI needed at first to replicate the values of the second vector a as many times as the number of the first vector a rowwise for example for the first element I need 6 rows with value 0.1, than for the second one 2 other rows with values 0.2 and so on filling an all vector. The resulting vectors would look like thisp  pB [0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.2 0.2 0.04 0.04 0.04 0.04 0.04 1 1 1 ]p  pI used repmat in a for loop for each row to obtain this result. The problem is that the vector will soon become too large and it gets quickly stuck since I am working with large numbers. So, I have tried to store each new repmat vector in a matrix with predetermined number of rows r which I need to have r relatively high and use vec2mat with padNaN to adjust for the dimension. This works well but still the matrix to fill is of size to high and at a given point the loop gets stuck. I have also tried to store each new repmat vector in array. This works well and really quickly and the final result is an array with n cells, with each cell containing the vectors of different length. In the example above I will obtain a array c 1x4 with in the first cell there is the vector [0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1], in the second one there is the vector  [0.2 0.2] and so on.p  pAt this stage there is my problem. Fixing an integer r, I need to compute a sequence of sums, summing values each r elements of all values in the cells taken sequentially. This means, I need to take the first r values of the first cell, than continue with the sum of the second set of r values right after the first set. When the vector of the first cell is finished it should start of the the second cell and so till the last cell of the array. The problem is that r could be higher or lower than the length of different vectors in each cell of the array. Than it can happen that for example in computing the second sum the values needed are the last rows of the vector in the first cell and the first rows of the vector in the second cell. However, I do not get to have access on elements of different cell sequentially.p  pIn the example above, fixing a value of r4, the result would be a vector of 3 x 1 p  pres  [sum1 sum2 sum3]  where p  psum1 is computed taking the first r5 rows of the vector of the first cells 0.10.10.10.10.1p  psum2 is computed taking the next r5 elements, i.e. the last rows of the vector in the first cell, the two rows of the vector in the second cell and the first two rows of the vector in the third cell 0.10.20.20.040.04p  psum3 is computed taking the next r5 elements, i.e. the last three rows of the vector in the third cell and the two first rows of the vector in the fourth cell and the first two rows of the vector in the third cell 0.040.040.0411p  pThen there is the last row of the vector of the last cell which value is 1 that it is not used and can be delated.p  pI actually do not need all the intermediate steps but only the final vector res with all the sums. However, I do not get how to go from the vectors a and b to the vector of res without go throughout this steps which in the case of matrix building I got stuck and kind of out of memory problems and in the case of cells array I did not get to access values in different cells sequentially. Is there a way to get a solution p  pThank you in advance for any suggestion.p  pJohnp

Negative 34063 pIs there a reasonable way to do rounded corners with Picasso thatp  ol liDoesnt significantly slow down drawing liWorks with hardware layers liDoesnt create an extra bitmap for each image liAllows resizing the downloaded bitmap into the size of the destination imageview ol  pMost of the picasso advice on rounded corners suggests that a transformation be used, but I havent seen an example that doesnt create an extra bitmap as part of the transformation.p  pThis seems to be because Picasso only uses bitmaps, while the tricks to do rounded corners use the fact that you can dynamically draw the rounded corners on reasonably efficiently most solutions use something along the lines of a hrefhttpwww.curiouscreature.org20121211androidrecipe1imagewithroundedcornershttpwww.curiouscreature.org20121211androidrecipe1imagewithroundedcornersa.p  pDoing this with Volley was a bit hacky but possible, by just changing the type of ImageView to something that took a custom drawable, which drew rounded corners. Since Picasso needs bitmaps at least, theres only a bitmap  bitmap transformation, this is out, since the conversion of the drawable to bitmap creates a bitmap in the process.p  pOne solution would be to do the work to modify picasso in a branch on my own that added a bitmap  drawable transform, but Id imagine theres a better way to go about this.p  pI do not want to draw a 9patch on top of a view to give the appearance of rounded corners.p

I want to make it higher like 6 cores on the same task OR each core will take care of one part like first core will start looping only 8 character length ones, and second core will do the same with 7 character length ones... and when one of them finds the answer, program will end.

Negative 34063 pI am writing a web application in AngularJS with the server code written in Java. The client code talks to server via HTTP API. The web application is mainly to show statistics and basically contain graphs. p  pThe web page contains fields like fromdate, todate and the name of the country for which the statistics are to be shown. So after selecting a few graphs  say I have a dashboard of 5  10 graphs , the web page provides an option to save the web pages state, so that, I can open the page with the same graphs still being shown. i.e., I need not have to select the name, date, etc. again to have the dashboard of graphs.p  pI can easily contain the from date, to date and name in Angular models. But to save the page and reopen again, I need to persist the model data into some storage media and upon reopen, I need to read from the storage media and populate the Angular model, rightp  pHow can I do this Should I go with some frameworks, like django, etc. where I have a separate database server such as sqlite running But I dont want such a complicated work. I need to have the simple client side coding  HTML  JS  and keep it neat. p  pIs there a solution for thisp

Negative 34063 pThis is related to the question I posted a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions23294985qtcannotgetftptoopendirectorycorrectlyherea, but I hadnt gotten much visibility for that question so I wanted to ask in a more general way. I have a Qt 4.7 project that utilizes QFtp functionality. Until very recently we were using this with an FTP server that was vsftpd. Everything worked fine with it then. However, several days ago we moved the server to a new computer. All the contents are identical, but now it uses pureftpd instead of vsftpd. Since the move, none of my QFtp code works properly. Is there any known problems that arise when trying to use QFtp with this type of FTP server I cant find anything helpful online, and its rather frustrating not being able to find anything wrong with the code and yet having it not work. If anyone knows anything about this and could please share, Id appreciate it a lot. Thanksp

Negative 34063 pI need to make a legacy program its huge support another language. Despite how badly Id love to send them my single language project files and ask them to do the rest of the work, the translation agencies tend to put up a fight when I do that. p  pSO I am looking to generate a list of all UI controls in a project and their default text that is currently displayed. Ill then send that out to the translator and Ill generate a .resx file with the results. As far as I understand, as long as I name the resx files correctly for the language i am targeting and the localizable able property is set to true, once the culture changes it will switch over all of the text on my controls. Let me know if i am off on this, I spend my time in the embedded world and for some reason the higher ups decided I should be the one to tackle this. p  pI figure i can parse through the designer file to get the list, but I was hoping someone has a more elegant solution or knows of one that someone has already built. This seems like it would be a pretty common task.p

Negative 34063 pI am currently running a program that rearranges genomes to create the best alignment to a reference genome, and as it does so it generates a number of folders like emalignmentem.p  pI have no way of knowing how many iterations this program will run through before it stops, but the final alignment is the best one could be anything from codealignment5code to codealignment35code and will have a predictable filename within the folder, though the folder will be changeable.p  pI need a bash script that will look inside a directory and identify the highestnumbered directory and store it as a variable or similar, that could ideally be passed to an additional program.p  pI just wanted to add that my scripting is very basic.

Negative 34063 pI found Bertrand Meyers emObject Oriented Software Constructionem, described in the reply to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1157847learningobjectorientedthinking11579201157920this questiona, to be invaluable in gradually coming to grok OOP. It changed the way I thought about writing code, and it has indirectly affected most of what Ive written since then. p  pI need to use some mediumsized databases in a few projects that Im working on, and Im hoping to have the same kind of epiphany about relational databases. I understand the basic concepts  tables contain rows of data organized into columns, some columns serve a special function by acting as a key, keys are used to construct relationships between rows of different tables, etc  but Im interested in getting a handle on the theory that dictates the best practices of database design. p  pIs there a canonical text that I could read to get this kind of understanding Is there something that every professional DBA has read I will be using an ORM  SQLAlchemy  for these projects, but Im interested in learning concepts in a platformagnostic way, since I have found that most SQLAlchemy tutorials focus more on the mechanics of SQLAlchemy than the fundamentals of databases.p

Negative 34063 pIn C, the codememmemcode function is used to locate a particular sequence of bytes in a memory area.  It can be assimilated to codestrstrcode, which is dedicated to nullterminated strings.p  pIs there any particular reason for this function to be available as a GNU extension, and not directly in the standard libraries The manual states p  blockquote   pThis function was broken in Linux libraries up to  and  including  libc 5.0.9 there the needle and haystack arguments were interchanged, and a pointer to the end of the first occurrence of needle was returned.p      pBoth old and  new  libcs  have  the  bug  that  if  needle  is  empty, haystack1  instead of haystack is returned.  And glibc 2.0 makes it worse, returning a pointer to the last byte of haystack.  This is fixed in glibc 2.1.p blockquote  pI can see it went through several fixes, yet Id like to know why it was not made as directly available if not more as codestrstrcode on some distributions. Does it still bring up implementation issuesp  pstrongEdit  motivations.strong I wouldnt ask this question if the standard had decided it the other way around  including codememmemcode but not codestrstrcode. Indeed, codestrstrcode could be something like p  precodememmemstr, strlenstr, search, 6  or memmemstr, strlenstr  1, search, 6 codepre  pSlightly trickier, but still a pretty emlogicalem oneliner considering that it is very usual in C functions to require both the emdata chunkem and its emlengthem.p  pstrongEdit 2strong  another motivation from comments and answers.

Negative 34063 pOur requirement needs Pojos to be generated based on user inputs. So classes are created on run time based on the inputs provided by users.

Negative 34063 pI hope what I try is not impossible.p  pLet me explain first I have a responsive design which requires a background to be fixed under some situations media query blocks. The design in question is this onep  pa hrefhttpthinkopen.atfileadmintemplatesresponsivecontent.html relnofollowhttpthinkopen.atfileadmintemplatesresponsivecontent.htmlap  pBasically there are two media queries one for the maximal height and one for the minimal width. If there is enough viewport height there is a scrollbar in the content area and the design height is fixed. But if the viewport is not large enough for showing the predefined height the heightmediaquery removes the scrollbar from the inner div so there wont be two nested scrolling containers body  div and sets the content area to height auto.p  pThere is also a responsive media query if the viewport is too narrow but this works flawless.p  pstrongNow the problemstrong When the design switches to the mode where the whole page scrolls below 830px height I would like to position the image in the right container fixed so it does not scroll out of the viewport. But then the problem arises, that I cant really position the background in regards to the container div as fixed positions an background image in regard to the viewport.

I have control over the table names associated with the top level classes, but I dont seem to have control over the name of the table created for the emElementCollectionem. It is always named emTopLevelClassNameElementCollectionNameem. It uses the class name directly rather than the table name specified by the owner class, and I cant find a way to override it in any way.p  pDoes anyone have a solutionp
Negative 34063 pIm working on dynamically changing a the textfields based on radiobutton selection. If I select single, then it should display different kinds of fields in the form and when I select multi it has different.  p  pTo achieve this, I created two divs to fit the elements which gets changed on radiobutton selection. I put the textfields in first dividsingle and repeated the same fields in second field in another dividmulti.p  pBased on radio button selection this works, but when I submit the form the values I have the below problem  p  ol lipWhen I select single, the form displays all fields required, but the submitted values are sent twice, i.e. in console I see two entries sent, I guess it is taking the fields of multi as well.  pli lipBut when I select multi it works fine, still I see two entries in POST of console. How can I avoid this.

Negative 34063 pCouldnt really work out what to search for to find a solution to this issue so apologies if its a duplicate.p  pIve got an issue where my fullscreen background banner doesnt load property if the page is allowed to load in a browser tab that isnt in focus. Its appears to only happen in Google Chrome.p  pThe end result is that the background image is the size of the viewport, but doesnt cover the whole document  i.e. it leaves a white gap at the bottom.p  pI tried to setup a fiddle, but it doesnt really replicate the issue due to it not happening in a frame, the site is a local staging env so unfortunately I dont have a link to share.p  pUPDATEp  pAfter playing some more, it would appear that the CSS needs a refresh to fix the issue. Basically if I make any change to the CSS of the container it will automatically fix the white space. However, if I add new CSS to an element inline that DOES NOT fix the issue. Modifying the CSS in any way with javascript also doesnt cause it to fix.p  pI wonder if theres some kind of callback I can issue if the page is switched to from a different tabp

Negative 34063 pA friend and I just started working in a project which other people stopped developing a couple of years ago, and were trying to resurrect it. Weve already solved most of the setuprelated issues, but theres a really annoying one that we cant figure out.p  pIn our localhosts, all the pages take strongA LOTstrong of time to loadrefresh. And I dont mean assets, scripts or anything, the problem is the latency until the first request completes. Most times it takes 15 to 30 seconds, which is unacceptable, and sometimes it even goes up to 1 or 2 minutes.p  pFor example, heres a screenshot of the Network tab in Chrome dev tools. The first row is the view, the other ones are assets.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comnQR2i.png altExample of crazy latencyp  pbr Weve googled for hours and tried a few different things, but none of them has worked. Some solutions like a hrefhttpserverfault.coma349618this onea point to some Apaches codehttpd.confcode settings, but I discarded that since Im using the same server for other projects and this never happened I tried it anyway, but didnt work. Others point to PHP version conflicts, so I tried changing the PHP in my MAMP from 5.4.10 to 5.2.17 the project requires 5.2.3, but that didnt seem to work either.p  pApart from my MAMP installation, we also tested it in a Windows machine with WAMP PHP5.5, and also in another Mac with a clean MAMP PHP5.5, and the same thing happens in both environments. So, we are now wondering if the problem could be in CodeIgniter itself which sounds unlikely or in some project configuration, but were pretty new to CodeIgniter and also not PHP experts and couldnt find anything. p  pOh, and we also tried contacting the original developers, but they said that was two years ago and sounded like theyre unwilling to help. I really hope they didnt have this issue while developing the project back then, because working with 30sec load times its just insane.p  pSomeone have any idea or know about something more we could try to find the issue I could post some code if needed.p  pbrp  hr  pstrongUpdatestrong I just found a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq236735782999215this unsolved questiona where a user experienced a similar issue with Laravel, but only sometimes.

When I reduce the number of Data it works finep  pso its seems that create the DOM when its outside the viewport is slow rendering in safari Ios, maybe some one experimented the same problem  p
Negative 34063 pSo I just started using bootstrap and I want to write a JavaScript function to close a popover. Its very easy to close a popover, you just select the popover html element and call popoverhide on it. p  pI want to write a generic function that will search upwards from the current element until it finds a popover element, and then it will call close on it. Lets call this function codeCloseParentPopovercode.p  pNow, ideally, I would be able to have any HTML link codeltagtcode that exists inside a popover to call this function onclick, and it should close the popover that the link resides in. Something like p  precodelta href onClickCloseParentPopovergt...ltagt codepre  pAnd that would just work.p  pThe function to search upwards until we find a popover is easy enough to implement. But I was wondering how exactly I would get which element was the one being clicked on. I need some way to know which link was clicked. Something like p  precodelta href onClickCloseParentPopoverthisgt...ltagt codepre  pbut obviously that is not valid.p

Negative 34063 pWhat Im trying to achieve is quite simple. Through code first, Id like to allow a user to have a series of contacts. Each of them will have the following options None, No encounter yet, and Client. What Im looking for, is to add the option selected to the database and retrieve its value. p  pThe problem is that I do not know very well how to setup correctly the relationships. Or I do not know if the query Im executing is actually managing the relationship. p  pThe approach Im going after is simple I create a dropdown list dictionary based which retrieves the data from ExposureResult table which is the table in which the options I mentioned previously reside None, No encounter yet, Client, and shows it to the user at the Contacts creation form. p  pWhen submitted, it will give me the ID of the row from the ExposureResult table, and I would insert it into the ExposureResultID which is the property emI thinkem I have set as a relationship, so I can call it later. p  pLater on I execute the following query p  precode var query  from c in dbs.ContactsDB where c.IboID  uid select c         return query codepre  pWhere dbs.ContactsDB is the DB Context of the Contacts model I have implemented and retrieves all the values Im looking after.p  pThe query variable will return to me the model in an IEnumerable. p  pWhich then, in the .cshtml file I would call it like thisp  pforeach var item in Model p  pitem.ExposureResult p  pBut it wouldnt return me the result Im expecting, which is getting what does the ID value refers in the ExposureResult, and not the ID itself.p  pHeres the modelp  pThe model is the followingp  precode    public class Contacts      [HiddenInputDisplayValuefalse]     [Key]     public int ContactsID  get set      [HiddenInputDisplayValuefalse]     public int IboID  get set      public string Name  get set       [DisplayNameFirst Time Met]     [DataTypeDataType.Date]     [DisplayFormatDataFormatString  0yyyyMMdd, ApplyFormatInEditMode  true]     public string FirstMeet  get set      public string Phone  get set       [DisplayNameDate of Contact]     [DataTypeDataType.Date]     [DisplayFormatDataFormatString  0yyyyMMdd, ApplyFormatInEditMode  true]     public DateTime DateOfContact  get set       public string Comments get set       [DisplayNameNext Exposure]     [DataTypeDataType.Date]     [DisplayFormatDataFormatString  0yyyyMMdd, ApplyFormatInEditMode  true]     public DateTime NextExposure  get set       [DataTypeDataType.Date]     [DisplayFormatDataFormatString  0yyyyMMdd, ApplyFormatInEditMode  true]     [DisplayName  Next Exposure 2]     public DateTime NextExposure2  get set       This is analogue to SelectedQ from Ibo Model     The main purpose is to receive the incoming data from the SelectList     [NotMapped]     public string SelectedResult  set get       [DisplayName  Result]     public int ExposureResultID  get set      public virtual ICollectionltExposureResultsgt ExposureResult get set     public virtual ICollectionltExposureResultsgt ExposureResults  get set      public virtual ICollectionltIbogt Ibo  get set    public class ExposureResults      public int ID  get set      public string ExposureResult  get set    codepre  pIm putting on an image to better explain what Im trying to achieve img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comNRh88.png altWhat Iquotm trying to achievep

Negative 34063 pSo, using knife we can create an EC2 instance and get its corresponding Chef node to show up on the Chef server, all with a single command. So far so goodp  pBut do you have a tool or workflow for validating the link between instance and node I had manually deleted an EC2 instance and so ended up with an orphaned Chef node.. it seems to me if I had a complicated network of instances I couldve missed that. Or do you entirely bypass this by having a hard rule that noone ever messes with EC2 instances directly, or something similarp  pIm new to Chef if its not obvious, curious to understand how using Chef scales.p

This is not an issue if in the same month but if it for the end of the previous month it thinks it is the end of the current month.p  pSo for example of on the 1st of the month I entered 30, this would be the 30th of the last month but this would only apply to no more than 3 days in the past, any other day would need to be in the future which is OK.p  pThe time is then added from another text box called txtSTD.

Negative 34063 pIm developing an Android app, which is supposed to connect to a web service and save data into the apps local database. Im using AsyncTask to connect to said web service from my Login class, which then returns the result to the processFinish method in Login.

Negative 34063 pIm making a grapher that draws a graph from a mathematical expression given by user .additionally the program has a slider and play button that user can choose a variable for the slider and its range so upon clicking the play button the slider will start from minimum range to maximum and the graph will be drawn. for the timer Im using the answer from a a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma284727694153713previous questiona.p  pfor the grapher Im using a hrefhttpwww.planetsourcecode.comvbscriptsShowCode.asptxtCodeId5276amplngWId2 relnofollowThisa code.

Negative 34063 pI have 16bit grayscale stream of scientific data which I want to analyse in openCV. I tried to look for some conversion of data, however it seems that grayscale is a trouble for ffmpeg and available codecs.p  pMy idea is to use 3 colours of video wisely and stream my grayscales into 3 colours, one by one and then in openCV access each colour and do my analysis there. Is such a thing possiblep  pWhen I convert stream by emffmpeg f rawvideo y s 256x256 pixfmt gray16be i rawfile.bin an vcodec ffv1 video.aviem, I get weird colour space but I can open the result in openCV.p  pIf there is any other way to do such a thing can you point me towards librarieshowtos, ultimately I need to do thresholding, crosscorrelation, edge filtering, centre of gravity types of functions and I need to do this as quickly as possible for datasets of 10GBp  pMy raw filesstreams are set of 256x256 16bit bampw images, with 256 bytes header and gapsp

Negative 34063 pI am developping web applications using the Xpages framework from the IBM Lotus Notes technology.p  pMy users dont use the embedded Notes Client browser, but use a regular modern browser Firefox, Chrome to browse Notes applications.p  pEverything is ok when the user has an internet connexion, he can access the application on the online server through his favorite browser.p  pHowever some of my applications need to be used Offline, in local. When a user works in local, he opens the IBM Notes Client, go to his workspace and click to open an application locally. Then, the Notes Client runs a http server on a random port and open the application with the embedded Notes Client browser.p  pWhat I want to achieve is to be able to open the application on a regular browser Firefox, Chrome, by just using the default system browser and not the embedded Notes Client browser.p  pHere is what I tried without success p  pWith codewindow.location.hrefcode I get the port where the local http server runs and the path to the page that is opened in the embedded Notes Client browser. I get this kind of result  p  pcode127.0.0.154428xspGfnCoffeShop.nsfxphome.xspOpenXPageampampxspRunningContextNotescodep  pSo I just keep the interesting part  p  pcode127.0.0.154428xspGfnCoffeShop.nsfxphome.xspcodep  pNow I need to pass the strongsession idstrong has a parameter of this http request so the browser will have the right to access the application. I get the session ID with the following p  pcodefacesContext.getExternalContext.getRequest.getSession.getIdcodep  pFrom this I get an ID and I build my complete http request p  pcode127.0.0.154428xspGfnCoffeShop.nsfxphome.xspSessionIDIDfae7aca8f062023972fe35e5909b0106f44ba2aecodep  pBut when I try this into a regular browser, instead of getting the page I get an strongerror 500strong. If I look at the log of the server, I see the following error message p  pcodeException Thrown javax.servlet.ServletException The request is not coming from a trusted Rich Client partcodep  pBut I am sure my ID is correct. I tried to investigate this on the internet but no success for now, I would be happy if someone has an idea about what do I miss Or maybe another way to open a local application in the default system browserp  pThank youp

Negative 34063 pI saw that in XCode 6 there is a built in level editor. I could not find a lot of documentation on how to use it or how it works, but I was able to figure out how to use it to make SKSpriteNodes then link them to a .swift file using childNodeWithName. When you make a new SpriteKit project, it starts with a GameScene.swift and a GameScene.sks. I was able to use these to make one level visually, then I could code for it in the GameScene.swift, but when I tried to make my own .sks and .swift file for a new level, I could not connect the .sks and the .swift file I had made. I tried following this tutorial exactlyp  pa hrefhttpwww.techotopia.comindex.phpAniOS8SwiftSpriteKitLevelEditorGameTutorialCreatingtheArcheryScene relnofollowhttpwww.techotopia.comindex.phpAniOS8SwiftSpriteKitLevelEditorGameTutorialCreatingtheArcherySceneap  pWhen I connected the two files no errors came up, and then when I transitioned to the scene it transitioned properly, but nothing that I added visually to the .sks showed up in the simulator. Please help, Ive spent hours researching solutions for this. The very few tutorials and forums that I was able to find about the level editor only talked about the GameScene.swift and .sks that start with a new SpriteKit project.p

The site works fine except when the athleteName string contains something unicode or whatever it is.p  pBy throwing in a few print ... into the code I seem to have found that on the webfaction server, the string received by the view is having the characters escaped.

Negative 34063 pI am currently trying to build a mobile page with a pinterest style look to display images. p  pTo be able to show images of different dimensions in specific columns i decided to use a hrefhttpmasonry.desandro.com relnofollow titlemasonrymasonrya as layout engine.  To trigger loading of new elements I chose a hrefhttpimakewebthings.comjquerywaypoints relnofollow titlejquer waypointswaypointsa p  pAdding elements dynamically to my masonry container works well when using a button to add them.p  pWhen I setup a waypoint at the end of my container to automatically fill in new elements, this waypoint gets triggered wenn i scroll to it the first time div with black background at the bottom of the page. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comcxTMd.png altlayout with waypoint div after initial setupp  pAfter the elements are being added, the waypoint is not updated to point to the bottom of the page again. Instead it seems to stick to the original position before adding the new elements.p  pWhen you take a look at my a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netTheChaosr7sov9px2 relnofollow titlejsFiddlejsfiddlea, you can see exactly this behaviour Elements get added to the container upon loading. When you scroll down you will reach the waypoint black bar to make it visible and there are new elements being added to the end of my masonry container. When you scroll down again to the bottom black bar again, nothing happens. After scrolling up to the top of the page and back down, you will see that the waypoint gets triggered again at the middle of the page old position of the waypoint.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com75WYe.png altlayout after waypoint got triggered first timep  pAs far as I understand the waypoints, it looks like i have to reset  recalculate the waypoint again after changing the DOM, so I tried adding code.waypointsrefreshcode in line 51 after the elements being added, but this results in the browser hanging and triggering the waypoint directly for a lot of times over 200, so be aware when you remove that comment that your browser may stuck or crash...p  pSo finally here is the question How can i add my elements dynamically and still update the waypoint to be able to lazy load new elements, whenever i scroll to the bottomp

Negative 34063 pIn my Android manifest, I have flagged my application as persistent, so that it automatically restarts if it crashes, is less likely to be killed by the system, etc. I know that normal applications cannot use this setting, but I am working on a custom ROM, and I load my application into the privapp folder, and so I am able to use it.p  pThis works perfectly well on preLollipop phones. However, when I load my APK onto an Android 5 phone, the persistent setting is no longer honoured. I can use dumpsys activity to verify that my app is persistent on Android 4.4.4, but not on Android 5.0.p  pIs there some additional requirement for persistence in Android 5 I see that some systemsupplied apps are still persistent, so its not as if its completely impossible.

It has to show up, if for example a QLineEdit has the focus.p  pQt manual says, that this has to work out of the box, but the problem is that when a QLineEditObject gets focused the virtual keyboard shows up and hides directly after that.

Negative 34063 pI would like to use programmatic access to manipulate shared variables on a computer and an NI cRIO 9033, but cannot get programmatic access to shared variables on the cRIO.p  pI have boiled the situation down to a very simple example to try to explain what I am seeing. The shared variables are hosted on the cRIO. I am using the same VI to perform the accesses on the computer and the cRIO. On the computer, access to the shared variable via a shared variable node and programmatic access both work. On the cRIO, access to the shared variable via a shared variable node is functional, but programmatic access to the shared variable does not work.p  pThe error code received when trying to to a Read Variable or Open Variable Connection on the cRIO to the shared variable is 1950678943. The error text reads Timed out while attempting to open a connection to the variable.p  pIm quickly becoming confused as to why the cRIO should have trouble reading a shared variable programmatically that is hosted on itself. The web searches I have done havent turned up such a simple scenario causing this error, so Im wondering if Ive stumbled into a beginner mistake.p  pBack Panel of the VI for accessing the shared variablesp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comW7AOJ.jpg altBlock diagramp  pResult of running VI on the computer all shared variable accesses  via shared variable nodes or programmatic access workp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comcJWJx.jpg altComputer resultp  pResult of running VI on the cRIO all attempts at shared variable programmatic access do not workp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comcuoTo.jpg altcRIO resultp  pstrongEDITstrong I appreciate the help troubleshooting this, but in the end I couldnt get shared variables to work for my application of programmatic access from a CompactRIO.

Negative 34063 pgo build and go run are very slow on a tiny program I have cgo invocations in particular.  Id like go to cache the binary so that it only rebuilds when the source is newer.

Negative 34063 pIts been about 5 days, of 5 hourday researching and I found no good solution. I am working on a green screen removal tool that removes the green screen from image, and I managed to remove the green background, but the final image is not exactly what I need.  Its pixelated and still contains some green pixels a bit more dark. Now my idea is to smooth blur the edges a bit, so this is not noticeable, but I cant find a way to do this. I know it can be done with edge detection, or with masks, but I do not have the required knowledge it seems to do it.p  pSo here is a sample image that has the background removed, its a transparent PNG a hrefhttpsodevrom.netTiBat.png relnofollowPixelated Edges PNGap  pright clicksave target as to view it full screen, to understand what I mean about the pixelated edges.p  pWould appreciate help on this.

Negative 34063 pI have an immutable base list of items that I want to perform a number of operations on edit, add, delete, read. The actual operations will be queued up and performed elsewhere sent up to the server and a new list will be sent down, but I want a representation of what the list would look like with the current set of operations applied to the base list.p  pMy current implementation keeps a vector of ranges and where they map to. So an unedited list has one range from 0 to length that maps directly to the base list. If an add is performed in index 5, then we have 3 ranges 04 maps to base list 04. 5 maps to the new item, and 6length1 maps to 5length. This works, however with a lot of adds and deletes, reads degrades to On.p  pIve thought of using hashmaps but the shifts in ranges that can occur with inserts and deletes presents a challenge. Is there some way to achieve this so that reads are around O1 stillp

Negative 34063 pI usually use the codearrangecode function from codedplyrcode to sort datasets, but it behaved in a way that I couldnt understand. Took me a little while to get to the bottom of this. Ive fixed my code and used codeordercode to do the same thing, but now Im curious. I have used codearrangecode without thinking twice for ages, and I wonder why this seems to be the default behavior. It looks like it fails to sort alphabetically when capital letters are involvedas in, it believes capital letters should come prior to lowercase letters, even if the latter precede them in the alphabet. Am I missing something p  pThis is not always a problem, but it did become one for me when I used codetapplycode immediately after arranging via codearrangecode, assuming that the data would be sorted in the same way that codetapplycode sorts when running. Heres an example of codearrangecode putting USSR before Uganda and the Ukraine, whereas codeordercode correctly, I think puts it last. p  precodelibrarydplyr countriesltcUSSR,Uganda,Ukraine tmpltdata.framecountries,stringsAsFactorsF tmp gt arrangecountries orders it one way tmp[ordertmpcountries,] orders it another way sorttmpcountries sort agrees with order codepre  pI looked around to see whether others had encountered this same problem, and couldnt see anything. Forgive me if this has been discussed previously. p
