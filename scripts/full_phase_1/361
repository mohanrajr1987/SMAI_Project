Positive 361 pI am working on precourse material for a coding boot camp. So, Im looking for guidance, not the answer. Im at a loss for how to approach this question. There is an HTML file that checks each step of the answer. With the code, Ive currently written below, I keep getting this response expected  to have a property push and the same error for pop. I believe I am adding the methods incorrectly. But I couldnt find any other way to add a method besides using prototype, which applies the method to all Array objects. I also tried doing simple tests which also failed.  p  precode returns an empty array object. this object should have the following    methods  pushval adds val to the end of the array  pop removes a value from the end and returns it  the goal of this problem is to reverse engineer what array methods are actually doing and return an object that has those methods function createArray      CODE HERE     var array  []     array.push  functionval          array[array.length]  val         return array             array.pop  function         return array[array.length1]        createArray console.logarray.pushhey codepre  pAnd the error messagep  precodeconsole.logarray.pushhey              ReferenceError array is not defined     at Object.ltanonymousgt UsersFoxDocumentsProgrammingCodesmithprecoursepart1Level2Intermediatesrcmain.js6713     at Module.compile module.js46026     at Object.Module.extensions..js module.js47810     at Module.load module.js35532     at Function.Module.load module.js31012     at Function.Module.runMain module.js50110     at startup node.js12916     at node.js8143 codepre  pI realize array is a local variable.

Positive 361 pSo I have a program where you need to call a get method to get two items in an object. I thought, what if I could just have it so if the user passes in nothing with the arguement...p  precodex.getItem codepre  pIt would work and just return one of the two items.p  pBut if they wanted a specific item...p  precodex.getItem0 or x.getItem1 codepre  pIs this possible in Java I just didnt want 0 to be random and 1 and 2 to be default...because that could get confusing to read later. p

Positive 361 pI am working on a VSTO addin for Microsoft Word 20132016, using Visual Studio 2015 and C. This code will open a file and perform many activities. For example, when the user presses the start button, the DOCX will open.p  pOnce the Docx file is open, I want to perform functions, such as modifying styles, changing graphic borders, and so on. In total, I foresee a need for about 1520 of these unique functions.p  pSince I want the code to be easy to read and update, I decided it would make sense to create a brand new class file that performs these activities, but am struggling because each public method I create has no idea the document is open. It seems I have to create a new object that represents the document each time.p  pSo far, I have come up with the following option, which I dont likep  pOn the onclick for the button that kicks off the process, write ALL the business logic within that one method.p  pThis is not ideal because I want each piece of logic to be in its own method. Also, I want my business logic to write back information to the form I am working on, but that external .cls file cannot seem to access the form I read that maybe I can set some getset properties on the form for this, but ultimately, I would like full control of the form.p  pDo you have some recommendations to help me with this challenge I read that regions might help but do not fully understand how that would make it easier to read the code. Also, I am just an accidental programmer and it is not my day job, so hopefully my question makes sense.p  pThank you for any advice you can provide.p

Positive 361 pI know the function vs. method discussions are well beat up on, so I will try to be brief.

Following the specification, FTX may appear but does not in my sample message, then there is a SG2 tag, which means the following NAD tag may repeat 99 times.p  pMoving slightly ahead inside the LIN tag which is under the SG12 group, which can repeat upto 9999 times and in many cases does repeat a number of times, it comes to the first QTY tag. According to the specification, this segment can have conditional group SG15 RFF and a DTM under it. Using my sample, you can see on line 17 and 18 that it has the QTY segment but line 18, has this conditional group too.p  pSimiliar things start happening when you look into the SCC segments too.p  pWhat I have in my mind, is to be able to enter that specification into some sort of file format, then run the raw EDIFACT message against the rules of this specification so the output is hierarchy based so its easy to see at a glance what data relates to what segment and a way to check to see if the EDIFACT message is valid.p  pWhat I have trouble with, is the actual algorithm or process to do that conversion.p  pI have tried naive approaches, like going line by line but then it gets messy when I am trying to work out if the current line is in a group, or a repeat or something else. I have tried a recursive approach, by splitting the entire EDIFACT by the largest group The SG12LIN group, then recursively process each of them splits and build an output. This has been my best approach yet but its still far from working with many false readings due to my logic not being right. p  pI basically need to be able to pick a segment of the message, and determine where in the hierarchy it should be and display it.p  pI am at a loss on how I can solve this. I am sure there is a nice simple method at doing this but I just cannot work it out.p  pAny assistance would be most grateful. p

Positive 361 pI am developing several plugin methods that generate a string, and pass it back to my main method. From here, I can then come up with a sequence number. However, I want to avoid integrating the plugin into my main program  basically anything that forces me to change my main program in any way to recognise this plugin is offlimits.p  pSo  in my main program, I generate a string, then match it with other matching strings to figure out the sequence number. The trouble is that I need to know the format of this string so I know where to input this number.p  pI was thinking about possibly passing in a method that knows the matching functions for this string, but Im not sure how I can pass a method from one program to another.p  pI have found a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4015451passamethodasaparameterthisa question, but this only appears to be within the same program.p

Negative 361 pFrom the man page on gitmerge, there are a number of merge strategies you can use.  p  ul lipemresolveem   This can only resolve two heads i.e. the current branch and another branch you pulled from using 3way merge algorithm. It tries to carefully detect crisscross merge ambiguities and is considered generally safe and fast.pli lipemrecursiveem   This can only resolve two heads using 3way merge algorithm. When there are more than one common ancestors that can be used for 3way merge, it creates a merged tree of the common ancestors and uses that as the reference tree for the 3way merge. This has been reported to result in fewer merge conflicts without causing mismerges by tests done on actual merge commits taken from Linux 2.6 kernel development history. Additionally this can detect and handle merges involving renames. This is the default merge strategy when pulling or merging one branch.pli lipemoctopusem   This resolves more than twohead case, but refuses to do complex merge that needs manual resolution. It is primarily meant to be used for bundling topic branch heads together. This is the default merge strategy when pulling or merging more than one branches.pli lipemoursem   This resolves any number of heads, but the result of the merge is always the current branch head. It is meant to be used to supersede old development history of side branches.pli lipemsubtreeem   This is a modified recursive strategy. When merging trees A and B, if B corresponds to a subtree of A, B is first adjusted to match the tree structure of A, instead of reading the trees at the same level. This adjustment is also done to the common ancestor tree.pli ul  pWhen should I specify something different than the default  What scenarios are each best forp

Now I want to be able to call this.ViewData from within my controller and get back the view data I passed in at the controller. Currently I get back a ViewDataDictionary from the Controller class. So I lost my type information.p  pHow can I retain my type information on my ViewData property in my CustomController derived class without wrapping it in a getset that does the boxing for mep

Negative 361 pIn my iPhone app, I have a view lets call it RectangleView within the content view that Id like to scale, along with all its subviews, when the iPhone is rotated. So, when the phone is rotated from landscape to portrait mode, Id like RectangleView and all its subviews to keep their original shape and position relative to each other, but just get smaller. I am using autoresizing on it and all its subviews in Interface Builder to try and do this.p  pNow heres the problem. When the phone is rotated, all of RectangleViews subviews scale and move relative to the entire content view, not relative their parent view which is RectangleView. This is a problem because the content view is now a different shape portrait than it was before landscape, and so all the elements on the screen are in the wrong places, when they should just be scaled down within RectangleView. And I am confused because some of these elements even move out of RectangleView, which I didnt even know was possible since they are supposed to be contained within RectangleView.p  pCan anyone explain what might be happening here, and how I can just scale RectangleView and all its subviews to retain their original shape and positions, but just on a smaller scale  Thanks in advancep

You get the basic of 2500 php tags, but I would like it to be more intuitive. such as dynamic variables, perhaps code completion and things of this nature. p  pI have been searching and testing, many many... is there anything that can compare or takeover the dreamweaver Or even an extension that makes PHP code much better in DW I have DWCS4 currently, I hope it gets fixed if they come out with CS5.p

Negative 361 pi actually try to do the following I have loaded an external image in a bitmapdata object and create a bitmap from it which i attach it to a spriteMovieClip in order to have mouse events on it.

When any of these links are clicked the results are loaded and displayed along with the associated pagination numbers for that specific content.p  pstrongI believe the problem is coming from the sql query in generatepagination.php seen below.

Negative 361 pI am currently working on a simple web application through Google App engine using GWT. It should be noted that this is my first attempt at such a task. p  pI have run into to following problemdilemap  pI have a simple Class getterssetters and nothing more. For the sake of clarity I will refer to this Class as codeDataHoldercode and I want to make it persistent. To do so I have used codeJDOcode which required me to add some annotations and more specifically add a codeKeycode field to be used as the primary key.p  pThe problem is that using the codeKeycode class requires me to import codecom.google.appengine.api.datastore.Keycode which is ok on the server side, but then I cant use codeDataHoldercode on the client side, because codeGWTcode doesnt allow it as far as I know.p  pSo I have created a sister Class codeClientDataHoldercode which is almost identical, though it doesnt have all the codeJDOcode annotations nor the codeKeycode field. p  pNow this actually works but It feels like Im doing something wrong. Using this approach would require maintaining two separate classes for each entity I wish to have.p  pSo my question is Is there a better way of doing thisp  pThank you.p

Negative 361 pI am trying to figure out what is the correct new approach for handling the Intent.ACTIONMEDIABUTTON in Froyo. In pre 2.2 days we had to register a BroadcastReceiver either permanently or at runtime and the Media Button events would arrive, as long as no other application intercepts them and aborts the broadcast.p  pFroyo seems to still somewhat support that model at least for the wired headset, but it also introduces the registerMediaButtonEventReceiver, and unregisterMediaButtonEventReceiver  methods that seem to control the transport focus between applications.p  pDuring my experiments, using registerMediaButtonEventReceiver does cause both the bluetooth and the wired headset button presses to be routed to the applications broadcast receiver the app gets the transport focus, but it looks like any change in the audio routing for example  unplugging the headset shits the focus back to the default media player.p  pWhat is the logic behind the implementation in Android 2.2 What is correct way to handle transport controls Do we have to detect the change in the audio routing and try to regain the focus p  pThis is an issue that any 3rd party media player on the Android platform has to deal with, so I hope that somebody probably a Google Engineer can provide some guidelines that we can all follow. Having a standard approach may make headset button controls a bit more predictable for the end users. p  pStefanp

Negative 361 pIm working with dynamic fields in ASP.NET due to a very specifc and rigid enduser requirement that would take 2 hours just to explain.  Suffice it to say, I cant make the requirement go away.  p  pAnyway, I have a working solution in place no problems with controls loading, rendering or maintaining their ViewState.  This is what my OnLoad looks likep  precodepublic void override OnLoadEventArgs e     dont need to check IsPostback, we have to load the controls on every POST      FormDefinition initialFormDefinition  ServiceLayer.GetFormDefinitionid  BuildControlsinitialFormDefinition  codepre  pIn order to implement some biz logic around which dynamic fields are required, disabled or optional, I need to get the posted values i.e. the ViewState of my dynamic controls before I can actually add them to the page control hierarchy.  p  pIts sort of a chickenegg problem I suppose.  ASP.NET wont automagically associate ViewState with the proper dynamic control until Ive added them all to the page.  On the other hand, I cant add these controls to the page until my service layer has applied biz rules that hinge on their current values.  I tried to get around this rather unpleasant problem by writing this bit of pseudocode p  precodepublic void override OnLoadEventArgs e  FormDefinition initialFormDefinition  ServiceLayer.GetFormDefinitionid  BuildControlsinitialFormDefinition  if IsPostBack   PushControlValuesIntoForminitialFormDefinition   var updatedFormDefinition  ServiceLayer.ApplyBizRulesinitialFormDefinition   ReBuildControlsupdatedFormDefinition remove controls and readd them    codepre  pUnfortunately, when you clear a control and readd it, the ViewState is lost, even if the control type and ControlID are exactly the same, so this solution is a bust.  Any reasonable ideas on how to accomplish what Im after are welcomep

Negative 361 pIve used Jersey for the better part of a year now and have just stumbled upon a problem to which I cant find the answer how do you intercept or hook into the Jersey request lifecyclep  pIdeally, Id be able to perform some custom filteringvalidationrejection between the time the container accepts the request from the network and the time my handler methods are called.  Bonus points if theres an easy way to filter the interceptors by subpath e.g. have one interceptor for anything under , another for anything under user, etc..p  pThanksp  pEdit To be a bit clearer, the general idea here is to be able to write some code that will be run for many API calls without having to explicitly call that code from each handler method.  This would reduce extra code and eliminate the need to pass request contexts around.p

Negative 361 pI am looking for a lightweight socket library that is compatible with Mono 2.6.3. Specifically, we need to make synchronous blocking HTTP requests inside our Monobased code, and cant use the builtin .NET sockets or Http classes for various reasons.p  pWe had some luck with Indy Sockets before, but since Mono upgraded to the .NET 3.5 framework weve had no luck finding or building a version of Indy that works in that environment. Indy is a strange beast, with its roots in Delphi and nearly impenetrable documentation. Do any of you know of something friendlier that could do the job Thanksp

Negative 361 pWere accessing a shared git repository via file paths, for various reasons Ill omit for now, created with sharedgroup.p  pWe have various unix groups but all share a common group. If I run a chgrp R on the git repository everyone can read from it, but if someone writes to it more often than not new files are created which do not use the common group.p  pThis problem appears to be because our primary group is not the shared one and if we run a newgrp all seems to work well.p  pThere are issues with this approach though newgrp is slow and it spawns a new shell, which makes me think calling it in a .bashprofile would be a bad idea, without even considering whether or not wed want emallem our new files to use the common group. Relying on memory to run it before doing any git work seems like a recipe for disaster too though.p  pSo... any suggestions Thanks in advance.p

Negative 361 pstrongNOTE I want to save the actual bytecode for the AS3 class, NOT an instance of itstrongp  pA class is being loaded in externally and extracted via a codeURLLoadercode and then codeLoader.loadBytescode. A single Class is then extracted out of that Application Domain and used in the project.p  pNow, rather than saving the entire Loader either via codeSharedObjectcode or other means of storage is it possible to extract out the bytecode of the needed class and all dependencies, which can then be injected back into an empty shell or something to be reused when neededp
Negative 361 pSuppose Im executing a synchronized block of code inside some thread and within the synchronized block I call a method that spawns another thread to process a synchronized block of code that requires the same lock as the first method. So in pseudo Java codep  precodepublic void someMethod    synchronizedlockobj       a whole bunch of stuff...       this is the last statement in the block     new ThreadsomeOtherMethod.start         some more code that doesnt require a lock   public void someOtherMethod     some setup code that doesnt require a lock     return the stuff we want to run in another thread    that does require a lock   return new Runnable      Override     public void run        synchronizedlockobj           some more code                 codepre  pI have no idea how to make sense of that code. Is what I have written even legal Syntactically I dont see any issues but Im not sure how to reason through code like that. So when I execute codesomeOtherMethodcode in order to create an instance of codeRunnablecode in what kind of scope does the code before the return statement run Does it execute as part of the first synchronized block Assume there are some other threads working as well that might require the lock on codelockobjcode.p
Negative 361 pI have a run configuration defined for my Eclipse RCP application which is saved to a .launch file.

Negative 361 pHullo,p  pOur web application runs on ASP.Net and Vb and loses the clients session variables if they hit an exception. One of the problems could be caused by it being a web garden with an inproc session state and having two workers, but this is only a rare problem and I would have thought receiving the wrong worker would happen every one in two times so Im not ruling it up to that.p  pIs there any way I can stop the web application losing its session variables when it hits and unhandled exceptionp  pThanks, Harryp

As this runs the risk of turning into a rant, let me be more specific and then follow it up with my questionp  pstrongSpring works great for setting up my classes and persisting them with Hibernate and all thatstrong. The main problem I am having is in trying to scaffold my project.p  pstrongI am working on a project that manages a few set references with manytomany and manytoone relationshipsstrong. This immediately will have problem with the scaffolding application.p  pstrongTrying to add Google Web Toolkit  via gwt setup kills the application immediatelystrong. Trying to load in Tomcat server becomes impossible and there is no way to undo the process as far as I know. Now what I have to restart my project from the original commands and reapply my changes as far as I can tell.p  pWith this being said it seems to me that the best process is to use ROO to generate my project artifacts and then create my own ViewController setup. Even here I am having problems though, because the tiles configuration seems so obscured from how it works. I am having a hard time figuring out how to take a custom JSP that can process some of these complex manytoone relationships AJAX enabled and add it to my web front.p  pAre there any guides for thisp  pFYI in the existing Roo Generated MVC I tried p  ul liCopying over my JSPli liCreating a Form Backing Objects that wraps the different entity typesli liModifying the views.xml file in the folder to recognize the pageli ul  pOne this was accomplished, though, I have been unsure how to proceed. How do I access my JSP Manually typing the URL as it is defined in views.xml does not work.p  pShould I think about abandoning Roo altogether and starting a Spring project from scratchp
Negative 361 pAs you know, its recomended handle exceptions using FaultException with standard WCF service to hide exception details. Thats fine but im having problem with WCF Ria service. I want to throw an exception from domain service and the client will handle that exception. I want to avoid disclosing exceptions sensitive information such as stack trace, method names etc. If it were standard WCF service, Id use FaultException exception, but in Ria service, its not working. No matter what kind of Exception I throw from domain service, the client always gets DomainOperationException. Is there any way I can throw a FaultException to the silverlight client from domain service to not disclose actual exception details For example, I have a login window. When the user hits login button, there should be several validation failures, such asp  ul liInvalid username or passwordli liUser account is lockedli liThe account is not activatedli lietc li ul  pI want to have fault types for each error that may occure. The client should check what went wrong and display error message accordingly. I disabled customErrors but it didnt help. Any help would be appreciated. Thanksp

Negative 361 pall. First of all I am sorry if this question is better for SuperUser, I couldnt tell. If it is it would be great if someone could migrate it. p  pSo anyway, Im building this service for SharePoint in Visual Studio 2008 with C. Of course I need to be able to debug it to build it fast. Unfortunately my OS is XP Pro which cant run SharePoint because it is not a server OS. Instead of reinstalling my OS which would create other problems I got Server 2003  SharePoint Server 2007 up and running inside a virtual machine with Virtual PC. Is there some sort of pipe I can create from Visual Studio that will let me test my service from within the virtual machinep  pThank youp  pI guess I should add, these are the tools I have been given.

Negative 361 pI created a simple PhoneGap application that, right now, just takes a picture when you tap a button and then displays the picture in an image on the same page. Ive built both iOS and Android versions, and the iOS version works fine. The Android version, on the other hand, highlights the button but never switches to a camera activity.

So, I completely replaced the contents of my index.html with the Full Example from the a hrefhttpdocs.phonegap.comphonegapcameracamera.md.html relnofollowPhoneGap API Camera reference pagea. This page displays four buttons, each of which triggers a Javascript function that uses PhoneGap to acquire an image in one way or another.

However, I wanted to retrofit jqGrid to a TomcatJava application that I took over management of strongNOTE but that I did not codestrong written back in 2005.  This app uses a combination of JSPServletsServicesVelocity on top of Tomcat 6.20.  The page in question is a Velocity template that is backed by a POST to a servlet that is the talks to the service.  I have jqGrid configured fine inside the template and it sets up properly on rendering.  p  pNow, all I am trying to do for starters is not modify anything in the service that returns the grid search results.  Ie, not wanting to have jqGrid postback for data on render just yet.  The service returns a search results collection object that contains the search results data for the grid and paginated based on some POST criteria that Velocity can manipulate in the template.  So, when the page is rendered by the Velocity engine, the data I seek is present, but locked up in the SearchResults collection.  What I am unsure about is what approach I should take to pull that SearchResults collection into the jqGrid as it is rendered along with the page  The original HTML grid was built with a Velocity codeforcode loop looping through the collection and building a TABLE structure with each rows attributes.p  pEventually, if the client likes this much and approves the expense to integrate jqGrid more fully, I will modify the service to return JSON directly to the jqGrid and let the jqGrid handle the data as one would typically do with jqGrids URL property, etc.  But I need to sell it first and was hoping I could work the existing results collection in as a first step.  Just new enough to JQuery and jqGrid to not be sure how to attack this in the least painful way as possible.p  pOne thing I am adding is that I am not a Velocity expert.  Only learned enough of it to maintain this package.  My understanding is that Velocity renders the page first before it is then sent to the browser.  So, it would seem that it could also render the codeltscriptgtcode section for jqGrid andor a data structure in the codeltscriptgtcode section that could feed jqGrids rows.  Just not sure what that needs to look like in a locally supplied context.  I have only worked with jqGrids URL GET and POST.p

Negative 361 pstrongProblemstrongp  pI am writing a program that reads a set of documents from a corpus each line is a document. Each document is processed using a function codeprocessdocumentcode, assigned a unique ID, and then written to a database. Ideally, we want to do this using several processes. The logic is as followsp  ol liThe main routine creates a new database and sets up some tables.li liThe main routine sets up a group of processesthreads that will run a worker function.li liThe main routine starts all the processes.li liThe main routine reads the corpus, adding documents to a queue.li liEach processs worker function loops, reading a document from a queue, extracting the information from it using codeprocessdocumentcode, and writes the information to a new entry in a table in the database. li liThe worker loops breaks once the queue is empty and an appropriate flag has been set by the main routine once there are no more documents to add to the queue.li ol  pstrongQuestionstrongp  pIm relatively new to sqlalchemy and databases in general. I think the code used for setting up the database in the main routine works fine, from what I can tell. Where Im stuck is Im not sure exactly what to put into the worker functions for each process to write to the database without clashing with the others. p  pTheres nothing particularly complicated going on each process gets a unique value to assign to an entry from a multiprocessing.Value object, protected by a Lock. Im just not sure whether what I should be passing to the worker function aside from the queue, if anything. Do I pass the sqlalchemy.Engine instance I created in the main routine The Metadata instance Do I create a new engine for each process Is there some other canonical way of doing this Is there something special I need to keep in mindp  pstrongAdditional Commentsstrongp  pIm well aware I could just not bother with the multiprocessing but and do this in a single process, but I will have to write code that has several processes reading for the database later on, so I might as well figure out how to do this now.p  pThanks in advance for your helpp

Editing is ok, but whenever I try to compile the project in Xcode, or with xcodebuild on the command line, my machine quad core i7 MacBook Pro, 4 GB RAM crawls to a halt. I have noticed that directly after starting xcodebuild, it spawns more than 8 clang processes, without the real compile processes starting. No xcodebuild output is so far seen on stout. Ive tried a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5417835howtomodifythenumberofparallelcompilationwithxcodereducing the number of parallel build processesa, but still lots of clang processes are launched at the beginning.

Negative 361 pIve had a scout around some answers to similar questions but they havent really helped me much.p  pI have an app, into which Ive embedded some resources.  At launch the app checks to see if the resources exist in the appdata folder and if not copies the template files from the embedded resources to the appdata folder before loading them and then using the ones in the appdata folder as the working copies.p  pI have a helper class which amongst other things returns the appdata and resources subfolder as followsp  precodeclass Folders      static public String GetUserFolder              return Application.LocalUserAppDataPath           static public String GetResourcesFolder               If the resources folder does not exist then create it         String userFolder  GetUserFolder         String resourcesFolder  userFolder  Resources          if Directory.ExistsresourcesFolder                      Directory.CreateDirectoryresourcesFolder                  return resourcesFolder           ... codepre  pSo my code calls the GetResourcesFolder method which returns the path creating the folder in the process if it needs to checks to see if the file exists and if it doesnt tries to write to it using something likep  precode        String filename  Helpers.IO.Folders.GetResourcesFolder  data.dat         FileStream outFile  System.IO.File.OpenWritefilename codepre  pSo Ive set the scene and this code is working on all the machines I had in the development office.

I have XP machines in the office that it has worked on without problems.p  pAfter digging out some really old dev machines that were archived a while ago, Ive managed to have a crash on two xp sp2 machines also.

However once the app has been successfully run once the app no longer crashes, even if I delete the filesfolders it created from the appdata folder it will still create the successfully on subsequent executions even if I dont elevate permissions.p  pThe problem I have is that I can now no longer repeat the crash on any dev machines available to me and I dont know how to go about putting the machine back into the state where I can.p  pAnybody got any ideas on what might be causing the problem, or how I may be able to return the machines to a virgin state to be able repeat the crash and help me track it down.p

But then the phone isnt mute at all games, YouTube,...li ol  pI had given codeAVSystemControllercode a chance using the methods codechangeActiveCategoryVolumeBycode and codesetVolumeTocode but those wont mute my phone but set the minimal volume of the ringer to 0.06 or something.p  pThere has to be a way to completely mute the iPhone, RingToggle jailbroken app is doing it quite good.p  pDoes anyone has a idea how to do itp
Negative 361 pI recently saw an OO design question on some forum and started thinking of using RTTI. However this must be bad design but I am unable to think of an alternative. Here is the simple question  p  pCreate a C program for the following scenario using OO concepts  p  blockquote   pMy dog, named Buddy, lives in the backyard. He barks at night when he sees a cat or a squirrel that has come to visit.  If he sees a frog, and he is hungry, he eats it.  If he sees a frog and he isnt hungry, he plays with it.   If he has eaten 2 frogs already, and is still hungry, he will let it go.  If he sees a coyote, he crys for help.  Sometime his friend Spot stops by, and they chase each other.  If he sees any other animal, he simply watches it. I would expect that you would have an animal class, and a cat, dog, squirrel, coyote class that inherits from the animal class.p blockquote  pI started thinking of having a see method in the dog class which takes an Animal argument and then checks the actual type of the object frog, cat etc and takes the required action  play, chase etc depending on the actual type. However this would require RTTI which must be bad design. Can anybody please suggest a better design which would avoid RTTI and also point out the mistake in my thinking p

I then moved files from the root of the repository into the new folder using codemvcode not codebzr mvcode and then ran codebzr mv autocode to detect the moves. bzr showed that it had detected the moves of each of the files, rather than removing the original and adding the files in the new location. I then tested this further by moving a file into the folder from within Emacs dired mode and running codebzr mv autocode and again bzr detected the move correctly.p

Negative 361 pIve been having an issue with URL Rewriting and Postbacks. p  pstrongEditstrong Currently using IIS 7 and the URL Rewrite module.p  pBasically after a Postback, my URL Rewriting completely messes up and added some duplicated and unnecessary field value pairs to my query string. Considering I was parsing the URL in my code, this broke an already working page after a Postback is raised.p  pFrom what I saw many people before me had the same issue and pretty much all of them have fixed it with modifying the strongForm Actionstrong on PageLoad, like sop  precodeprotected void PageLoadobject sender, EventArgs e              form1.Action  Request.RawUrl          Some other interesting things.      codepre  pstrongImportantstrong This did the trick, it emworks.emp  pHowever, although my developing experience is literally less than a month, Ive been trying so far to look for more elegant solutions to my problems. Ive been hinted that there might be a better alternative that involves strongediting the emGlobal.asaxemstrong in order to have the same results on a more global level.p  pThis should, in my opinion, make it more efficient overall as the trick will be done before any other page is called.p  pemstrongSo my actual question isemstrong p  pHow can I achieve the same by editing the Global.asax file instead of modifying the Form Action on my MasterPage loading event If you have an even more elegant solution I would appreciate that you include it as well.p  pConsidering this is my first question, I hope Ive been constructive enough.p

So the slideshow, dropdown menu, and quicktabs would have things related to business. If someone clicked on residents, it would take them to the residents sections with the same layout, but different images in the slideshow, different items to click in the dropdown menu, and different tabs in the quicktab.p  pI have tried using views to do this, but I keep getting the feeling that this is not what I want.

Negative 361 pI have a bunch of markers on my map and I would like an image to fade in whenever you hover over each marker.p  pSo far the InfoBox itself has no background image to appear invisible, with the jQuery effect being applied to the image once the InfoBox is open, but I cant get the effect to trigger when I use the same mouseover event to show open the InfoBox.

Negative 361 pI have a bunch of legacy code that uses Cstyle file IO using codeFILEcode streams, codefprintfcode, codefscanfcode, etc. that Id like to update to operate off of other data sources e.g., downloading from or posting to the web, or to or from a custom data transfer cable.p  pIf it used iostreams, this would be an easy update, but it doesnt.p  pAre there any C or C libraries for IO that support different kinds of streams but that are sourcecompatible or mostly sourcecompatible with Cs codeFILEcode stream functionsp  pIf source compatibility is too much to ask, Id settle for able to be searchandreplaced with a Perl script.  codefprintfcode and codefscanfcode seem to be the major obstacles here I havent found any codeiostreamcodecompatible versions of these.p  pIm looking for a solution that will work in both Windows and Linux.p  pstrongExamplestrongp  pAs a trivial example, I have code like the followingp  precodeFILE input  fopenfilename, rt fscanfinput, d,d,d,f, ampfid, ampfunits, amphindex, amphdefault fcloseinput codepre  pId like to update it to handle data thats of the same format but may come from other sources, without having to worry about the intricacies of how exactly to replicate codefscanfcodes semantics myself since I have many, many codefscanfcode and codefprintfcode calls that would need updating.

Negative 361 pFrom what I have read, CQRS designs involve asynchronous commands where commands are put in a queue. The user assumes all is okay and the UI polls or via a timer gets some feed back if all worked or not.p  pHow would this work if I had a UI where I am dragging folders in a tree I could have one user deleting a folder whilst another dragging a folder to it to make it a sub folder of it.p  pSo from the UI I could show the drag has taken place and then from in some timer check to see if my read model has be updated i.e. check for the parent folder of the dragged folder and if it is set correctly I know it has worked.p  pIf the user has done a number of drag operations, I would have to keep a list of these operations in the UI and check the read store removing any successful commands from the list.p  pThere maybe better ways to do this.p  pIt just seems a lot of work on the UI and more prone to error whereas if I just run a synchronous command and if all is okay, then I move onto my next operation.p
Negative 361 pI am working on a site overhaul. As a result I am moving several pages over to a new format.

Is it OK to put 3000  301 redirects into an a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiHtaccess relnofollow.htaccessa file p  pOn a side note, for proper a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiSearchengineoptimization relnofollowSEOa, should I also make sure I use http instead of http www and also make sure they are fully lower case and also close with a  at the end of the URL. I am redesigning into wordpress and any combination pretty much works but I understand that for Google they can be considered unique but similar URLs so I want to stick with one as much as possible. p  pThanksp

Negative 361 pI have a somewhat weird problem. I created a chrome extension that will automatically scroll down as users edit a google document. It seems to be working okay when the doc is in paginated mode. If I switch it to compact mode, then it seems like jQuery wont get all the requested elements. The basic HTML tree is pretty much the same in paginated and compact modes. Im stumped and not sure why its not working correctly. We should be looking mostly at how currentPage works. Sometimes the height returns 0 when it shouldnt happen. p  pstrong[EDIT] Heres when itll mess upstrong It works fine in paginated mode. But when I start the extension in compact mode when there are text already on page 2, itll work as expected. If I delete texts all the way back to page 1, itll still work as expected.

Negative 361 pstrongIntrostrong I have a native library C with Java JNI wrapper. The library engine is cpu intensive, we dont want more than one app linking this lib to be running at the same time, and complex objects should be returned by the lib engine.p  pstrongThe questionstrong What is the best way to engineer such an Android libraryp  pSo far, I could find just find 2 valuable examples emOpenCV managerem and emConnectbot sshagentem.p  pI can think of a few solutionsp  ul lipstrongSolution 1strong Make a bound or AIDL service that wraps the library functionality. should the service run in its own space or in the space of the application that links to it how can the native lib be loaded if its in a different app spacecodeSystem.loaddatadatacom.company.myLiblib.socode. How to return complex objects in AIDL. This should be the Connectbot way.pli lipstrongSolution 2strong Divide the lib into 2 componentsp  ol liA standalone package which keeps the native libs  a manager serviceli liAn android libproject which only contains Java wrappers which users can use to build their apps.li ol  pThis should be the OpenCV manager way.

Numltintgt n  5  Numltintgt10 codepre  pThe book says that this wont work and indeed it doesnt because you cant expect the compiler to use implicit typecasting to specialize a template.p  pAs a soluting it is suggested to use the friend syntax to define the function inside the class. p  precodeIt works template lttypename Tgt class Num  public   Numint n  ...     friend    Num operatorconst Numamp lhs, const Numamp rhs  ...

Negative 361 pOn a Galaxy S3, I have an issue where a button in the ActionBar is configured as showAsActionalways and being shown on both the hardware overflow menu and the Action buttons.

Negative 361 pI have a project that requires changes in MVCs default routing behavior for image http requests.p  pFor example, this sample from RouteConfig.csp  precodeRoute ImagesRoute  new RoutecontrollerfolderNamefileName, new ImageRouteHandler string regexWindowsFilePattern  [x00x1f    ltgt].jpegjpgtiffgifpng  ImagesRoute.Constraints  new RouteValueDictionary   fileName, regexWindowsFilePattern   routes.AddImagesRoute codepre  pshould reroute p  precodehttplocalhosthomecontentsimage.jpg codepre  pto path on disk ccache[folderName][fileName]. The rerouting in my case is just writing the correct http response based on request. In one project lets call it the Test project this code triggers normal behavior the GetHttpHandler method of ImageRouteHandler class gets hit and the image appears in browser, however in other project with identical code for RouteConfig.cs and ImageRouteHandler inserted GetHttpHandler simply does not fire which results in 404 NOT FOUND http error. This other project the destination project has almost the same configuration I have checked the relevant differences and have been run on the same IIS express server. Creating new project and populating in with contents of destination and test project results in normal behavior i.e. the image is displayed in browser. Any clue on what the solution might bep  pupdate1br I forgot to mention that the action is not used deliberately. I have an html file that I must include into partial view which will render html file body. I dont have control over how this file is created but I have a defined structure html file with name [htmlFileName] and a resource folder name with name [htmlFileName].files. When I request a specific URL say localhost[Controller][Action] the references to resources in HTML markup result in incorrect URLs http localhost[Controller][folderName][fileName] so I need to rewrite these URLs so that the browsers http image requests are prorerly answered.

Negative 361 pIve been digging around for an alternative solution to this problem that has started happening intermittently with the addition of a number of services to the current SOA. p  pIve seen that the Service Control Manager will generate an event if a service does not respond within the defined timeout period the default timeout is 30000 milliseconds. And to alleviate this an entry can be changed to set the default timeout value for all services.p  pIn the Registry Editor, edit the registry subkey HKEYLOCALMACHINESYSTEMCurrentControlSetControl. In the details pane, locate the ServicesPipeTimeout entry Modify the DWORD to something greater than 30,000 ms, while this works after I made the modification it wouldnt be optimal to start changing registry entries on all the machines the might have this problem.p  pAlso it would be best not to make a registry entry that might affect all services on computers that I dont have control over, is there a way in which I could get the SOA to respond to the Service Control Managers start request and say that it hasnt completed as of yetp

Negative 361 pI am trying to run and debug C code in Tux Racer source code for Android. Most of a code is written in C, so I converted Android project into C Project Adds CC Nature.

Negative 361 pIm working on an implentation of a Suffix Array to be used for speeding up phrase searches.p  pI have an array of Suffixobjects, this is the Suffix Array.

How can I use Arrays.binarySearch with the Comparator I made to compare a String key the phrase Im searching for to search the suffix array It would be trivial to compare the String with the Suffix object if the binarySearch method would let me somehow do it in the Comparator...p

Negative 361 pWe are trying to implement a special partial update function in Spring 3.2. We are using Spring for the backend and have a simple Javascript frontend. Ive not been able to find a straightforward solution to our requirements, which is emThe update function should take in any number of fieldvalues and update the persistence model accordingly.emp  pWe have inline editing for all of our fields, so that when the user edits a field and confirms, an id and the modified field get passed to the controller as json. The controller should be able to take in any number of fields from the client 1 to n and update only those fields.p  pe.g., when a user with id1 edits his displayName, the data posted to the server looks like thisp  precodeid1, displayNamejim codepre  pCurrently, we have an incomplete solution in the UserController as outlined belowp  precodeRequestMappingvalue  id, method  RequestMethod.POST  public ResponseBody ResponseEntityltUsergt updateRequestBody User updateUser      dbUser  userRepository.findOneupdateUser.getId     customObjectMergerupdateUser, dbUser     userRepository.saveAndFlushupdateUuser     ...  codepre  pThe code here works, but has some issues The codeRequestBodycode creates a new codeupdateUsercode, fills in the codeidcode and the codedisplayNamecode. codeCustomObjectMergercode merges this codeupdateUsercode with the corresponding codedbUsercode from the database, updating the only fields included in codeupdateUsercode.p  pThe problem is that Spring populates some fields in codeupdateUsercode with default values and other autogenerated field values, which, upon merging, overwrites valid data that we have in codedbUsercode. Explicitly declaring that it should ignore these fields is not an option, as we want our codeupdatecode to be able to set these fields as well.p  pI am looking into some way to have Spring automatically merge ONLY the information explicitly sent into the codeupdatecode function into the codedbUsercode without resetting defaultauto field values. Is there any simple way to do thisp  pstrongUpdatestrong Ive already considered the following option which does almost what Im asking for, but not quite. The problem is that it takes update data in as codeRequestParamcode and AFAIK doesnt do JSON stringsp  precodeload the existing user into the model for injecting into the update function ModelAttributeuser public User addUserRequestParamrequiredfalse Long id     if id  null return userRepository.findOneid     return null  .... method declaration for using MethodAttribute to prepopulate the template object RequestMappingvalue  id, method  RequestMethod.POST  public ResponseBody ResponseEntityltUsergt updateModelAttributeuser User updateUser ....  codepre  pIve considered rewriting my codecustomObjectMergercode to work more appropriately with JSON, counting and having it take into consideration only the fields coming in from codeHttpServletRequestcode. but even having to use a codecustomObjectMergercode in the first place feels hacky when spring provides emalmost exactly what I am looking, minus the lacking JSON functionalityem. If anyone knows of how to get Spring to do this, Id greatly appreciate itp

Negative 361 pLet me start off with saying I have looked around and I guess my question is too specific to get any straight forward results. Also this is my first VB project. p  pI am trying to make a simple point of sale GUI. I have two textboxes Price, Cash tendered and 11 buttons making a number keypad. What I want to do is be able to click on the number keypad buttons for example, buttons 1 and 0 to enter 10 dollars and it go to the textbox that the cursor last clicked on. p  pSo here is an example I click on the textbox Price then click the button 1 and the button 0. This will then type 10 to the Price textbox. After that, I want to be able to click on the Cash Tendered textbox and be able to use the same number keypad buttons as before for the same operation.p  pA a hrefhttpimgur.comaHu6zO4 relnofollowpicture of the GUIa is available.p

Negative 361 pI have a Base Activity class to implement common behaviour for all the Activities. All of them extend this BaseActivity.p  pIm binding to a service in in the BaseActivitys onStart method and unbinding emconditionallyem in the onStop method. With conditionally, I mean that depending on some option selected by the user, the service should or should not keep running in the background when the app goes to background.p  pThe problem is that sometimes the service keeps running when it shouldnt this is, when the option for killing it is enabled, and unbindService is effectively called.p  pIm thinking that on every Activity change the service is unbound and bound again. Since bound services are reference counted, maybe my service is bound more times than unbound, so thats why it keeps running at the end, even when I call unbindService.p  pAdditionally, the a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comguidecomponentsboundservices.htmlBinding relnofollowdocumentationa says something about thatp  blockquote   pYou should usually pair the binding and unbinding during matching bringup and teardown moments of the clients lifecycle. For examplep      pIf you only need to interact with the service while your activity is visible, you should bind during onStart and unbind during onStop.p      pIf you want your activity to receive responses even while it is stopped in the background, then you can bind during onCreate and unbind during onDestroy. Beware that this implies that your activity needs to use the service the entire time its running even in the background, so if the service is in another process, then you increase the weight of the process and it becomes more likely that the system will kill it.p blockquote  pSince Im kind of trying to implement both options, what should be the best approach to implement thisp

The Injections table will have a foreign key to a row in Patients table.p  pSo far so good.p  pNow, lets assume a database case as described above, with 1 patient which has 100,000 injections.p  pWhen I ask DbContext for this patient it will retrive the patient data and the list of Injections will load only by demand.p  pThis looks like a potential problem. Im saying to any potential user of Patient  hey, you have a list of injections, use them Only do  myPatient.Injections and they will magically appear.p  pHowever, by exposing this property I am potentially enabling a user of patient to run a very heavy query which may not even be an application need.p  pA possible solution is to remove the list of Injections from the patient class. Regarding the database, the mapping will remain the same, and in order to query injections of patient I will use a concrete service. But now I have a Patient class that doesnt represent my domain in a good way.p  pAnother possible solution is to map each object returned from EF context to another shallow object. I will map only what i need, and wont expose unneeded data to the user. This approach will cause duplication and the maintaining of mapping between classes.p  pWhat do you think about this issue p  pShare your knowledege p

Negative 361 pFor me below are the most probable definitions for asynchronous and nonblocking IOp  pstrongcodeAsynchronous IOcodestrong In asynchronous IO applications return immediately and OS will let them know when the bytes are available for processing.p  pstrongcodeNONblocking IOcodestrong Here application returns immediately what ever data available and application should have pooling mechanism to find out when more data is ready.p  pAfter knowing these definitions if we analyze java channels i.e. codeSocketChannelcode, codeServerSocketChannelcode, codeDatagramSocketChannelcode then we can find that these channels can be used as blocking or nonblocking mode by the method codeconfigureBlockingboolean blockcode. and assume that we are using them as nonblocking mode. So here comes the questionsp  pif i will use codeSelectorcode emi.e. register channels to a codeselectorcodeem whether it is strongAsynchronous IO or NONblocking IOstrongp  pI feel this is Asynchronous IO in java if and only if underlying operating system is informing the java application about readiness selection of a channel. Else it is  nonblocking IO and codeselectorcode is just a mechanism which helps us pooling the above mention channels as i mention in the definition. Which is correct Thanks in advance.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pI have answered one part of the question i.e. types of IO and how java facilitates these functionality.p  pemstrongBut one question still remains whether all these functionalities are provides by java is simulated at java layer or it uses underlaying OS to facilitate Assume the underlaying OS has all the support for these functionalities.emstrongp  pPlease refer to the answer. p

Negative 361 pIm building an app for which I need to store my users login credentials for a 3rd party service. Communication with the 3rd party service is done via https GET requests.p  pFrom what Ive seen, looking at posts like a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1994112imuststorethirdpartycredentialsinmydatabasebestwaythis onea, theres no clear answer as to the best practices for doing this, and the specific methods discussed in that post at least all leave something to be desired.p  pSo one thought I had was that perhaps itd be possible to get around the problem by preencrypting the query string for the 3rd party request and storing that encrypted data in my db in lieu of storing the users credentials directly. This way I can store the credentials in an encrypted form but not worry about the key being compromised, as its held by the 3rd party, not me. And if my db were compromised the intruder wouldnt get anything more than he could obtain by packet sniffing.p  pI cant seem to find any examples of anyone doing something like this, so Id like feedback on whether the community thinks its a reasonable approach. Beyond that, a little help on how exactly to do it would be great. Im building my app in node.jsexpress, and currently Im just using the https module to handle communication with the 3rd party, but clearly Id have to go at it at a lower level in order to take this approach.p  pThe basic process would bep  ol liDo the same thing as https.request in order to establish an ssltls connection to the 3rd party and encrypt the query string containing the users credentialsli liStop short of actually sending the encrypted data to the 3rd party and instead store it in my dbli liAt a later time, reconstruct the https connection with the stored data and send it to the 3rd party, process response, winli ol

Negative 361 pI hope this isnt a duplicate. Im currently working on client server game based on netty with a client on Android. Im trying to make a secure login process so I tryed using ssl on top of java socket.p  pI managed to create a selfsigned certificate and to use SSL. The problem is that the example source code i found use  custom TrustManagerFactory which doesnt make any check upon certificate validity. Since I dont want to allow Man In The Middle attack i searched for more information on SSL handshake and here is what i understoodp  ol liTo initiate SSL session, the client send a request to the server. li liThe server which own the certificate.jks or .bks extract public informations into a X509 certificate and send it to the client.li liThe client check for the validity of the certificate  In my current solution do nothingli liIf check succed retrieve the servers public key from the certificate, generate a random key, encrypt it with the public key and sends it to the server.li liThe server use his private key to decrypt the randomly generated key.li liBoth client and server now share the same random key and they start a comunication using this key for symetric encryption  like AES .li ol  pI dont need to accept certificate from anyone else than my own server so i thought about 2 solutionp  ol liSave the X509 on client side and create  custom TrustManager witch only accept this certificate. This solution seems easy to implement but rather hard to maintain since every certificate change on server side would need to update X509 certificate on every client. li liCreate my own CA certificate sign my ssl certificate with this certificate and manage somehow to tel my client to only trust all certificate signed with my CA.li ol  pWhat i understood about CA authentification is this p  ol liA CA root certificate is a normal certificate that contain a key pair.li lisigning a certificate with a CA mean adding at the end of the beingsigned certificate a hash of the whole certificate encrypted with the CA private key. li lithis signature is contained in the X509 certificate along with some informations about CA.li liTo check certificate validity, the client generate certificate hash and compare it to the decrypted hash using CA public key contained in the X509 certificate.li ol  pSo if im not mistaking in all of this, if i want to implement my second solution, I need to provide a CA certificate to the client so that he can check certificates. Ive seen that it is possible to init  TrustManager with a truststore. I asume it must be a different certificate from the root CA one since the whole security of this depends on my CA private key s confidentiality. So my questions are p  ol liWhat should this client truststore contain and how to generate if from my root CA  li liI have red that ssl engine is broken for self signed certificate. So is my second solutions viable on androidli liIf this can work, how can i invalidate my certificate if i see that someone manage to get my private key somehow I have red things about crl but i dont know how to generateuse them in my truststoreli ol  pthanks in advance.p

Do I have to check manually the number of results of the following page to verify if it is emptyp  p2 The document also says You might notice that the number of results returned is not always equal to the limit specified. This is expected behavior. Query parameters are applied on our end before checking to see if the results returned are visible to the viewer. Because of this, it is possible that you might get fewer results than expected.. This should not affect likes retrieving, am I right I think it is not possible that some likes are viewable and some others not.p  pThanks.p

Extending the MVCmodel with the provided codesnippets from this   a hrefhttpdocs.joomla.orgAddingsortablecolumnstoatableinacomponent relnofollowtutoriala does not lead to the expected result, the columns cannot be sorted. p  pI guess, the problem is related to Step 2 Adapting the View of the guideline.

Negative 361 pIm redoing an old homework assignment for fun to learn how to use Parsec and Im having trouble structuring my parsers for Exits and the included datatype. So first we get a file with a list of rooms. Each room contains a room name below  Room , some description or story and then a list of Exits in the format of codedirection, destinationcode. Eventually a person would choose a direction and youd look up room name and bring the player to the next room. p  precode Room  Center You are in a square room.

So there could be Maybe Exits.p  pI have gotten as far as the exits part and all my parsers before that step seem to work.

Negative 361 pI am writing an updater program on in C using Visual Studio 2008 on Windows 7. I would like the user to insert a USB thumb drive and if the program finds the drive and updates on the drive then it automatically copies them over. I desire to check only once at startup and then execute a program that is unaware of the updates updates really need to happen with the program shutdown.p  pMy issue is that the update program is being run before the thumb drive is being mounted so the computer detects no thumb drive and no updates and moves on prematurely. I want to have everything running as fast as possible but I need to force any thumb drives to mount before detection. Everything must be automatic with no input from the user.p  pIs this possible in cp  pEdit with more detailp  pI currently run a batch file at startup actually as the Windows 7 shell, but Im not sure that makes a difference. The batch file runs the update check then the actual program. If the user had the USB drive stuck in at boot then I would like the updater to look at the drive and copy over any new files.p  pThe current coded looks likep  precode DriveInfo[] ListDrives  DriveInfo.GetDrives  foreach DriveInfo Drive in ListDrives         ifDrive.DriveType  DriveType.Removable                    double check its valid and copy over stuff          codepre  pbut it currently finds no drives at boot. If I run it later then everything is fine. I am assuming that since I run the updater so early it just hasnt had a chance to mount, but I dont just want to wait N seconds if I dont have to because under normal circumstances thats just dead time.p  pIf I can do this check easy up from it is much simpler than having to continually monitor for an event and then shut everything down and do an update.p

Negative 361 pThis was bugging me for a while and now it became more relevant with the release of .NET 4.5.1. I checked the latest NuGet packages and it seems like nobody even Microsoft bothered to include new .NET 4.5.1 assemblies. I assume that these packages do not use any of the new functionality that came out with this release. p  pI have some really simple libraries on NuGet and I can compile them with even .NET 4.0. I included .NET 4.5 assemblies but they do not contain any functionality specific to .NET 4.5. Its the same project built with a TargetFrameworkVersion parameter.p  pBoth .NET 4.5 and 4.5.1 are a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.combdotnetarchive20110926compatibilityofnetframework45.aspx relnofollowinplace updatesa. So it shouldnt matter for someone who uses my library that I provided an assembly for each framework version. If they have .NET 4.5 installed, does it make any differencein performance maybe if they use a .NET 4.0 or .NET 4.5 assemblyp  pIn summary I want to know when I should provide assemblies built in later versions.p

Negative 361 pI am getting status code 403 when I try to log in after successfully being logged in and logged out. p  pClient side is written in Angular and server side is in Django.p  pThis goes as followsp  ol liClient requests url codecode fetches main HTML template with all required static files  angular, bootstrap, jQuery sources and angular sources defined by me with  codeltdiv ngviewgtltdivgtcode tag into which further templates will be inserted.li liVia location service is redirected to url codelogincodeli liThis rule from coderouteProvidercode is executed once codelogincode is hit  coderouteProvider.whenlogin,      templateUrl login.html codeli licodelogin.htmlcode is served by django view and form for logging in is rendered to the userli liUser logs in successfully providing proper credentialsli liThen user logs out, by clicking on a button, which fires codehttp.get             logout         code and then is redirected to url codelogincodeli liHere is the problem. When user fills in credential form and sends codePOSTcode request, 403 is returned.

Negative 361 pI am trying to use GZIPInputStream in Java to decompress image data coming from my .NET application which compresses in GZIP format. The image data is transferred as base64 strings because it is synced over as XML text. I was under the assumption that the stream would read into the buffer passed into .read parameters until the buffer was saturated. It is not working as I had expected, i.e., the .read only reads lets say, 800 or so bytes per read operation. This is not a problem for small images but for big ones, like 800 KB it takes a very long time to decompress.

Negative 361 pFirst some background information about the situation. I have a main application lets call it the Core and some minor applications lets call them Core jobs. The main job of the Core is to make sure, that every any given Core job is running according to the schedule of the said job. Its all developed in .NET Cp  pI would like to make an environment where each Core job can trace information to different logfiles. I considered to use simple filestreams, but I believe there must be a more elegant solution to this.p  pIt seems to me, that I might be able to use the inbuilt TraceSource and listeners. I made a TextWriterTraceListener for each job and started tracing. The result Every job traced information to every listener.p  pBack to the drawing board. I studied it a bit more and now can see how foolish my first approach was. I now made a source for each job and a listener for each source. In the code I specify which source I like to trace to.

Negative 361 pTrying to figure out a good solution for handling different resolutions and resizing in a 2D sidescrolling shooter game build with OpenTK OpenGL.p  pOrtho is setup as follows.p  precode    private void Setup2DGraphics              const double halfWidth  1920  2         const double halfHeight  1080  2         GL.MatrixModeMatrixMode.Projection         GL.LoadIdentity         GL.OrthohalfWidth, halfWidth, halfHeight, halfHeight, 1.0, 1.0         GL.MatrixModeMatrixMode.Modelview         GL.LoadIdentity      codepre  pOrtho fixes to 19201080 to keep the ortho fixed size. Changing size would change game behaviour. Objects movement is set to pixelssec etc.p  precode    public void ResizeWindowint width, int height              var screenSize  GetOptimalResolutionwidth, height          var offsetHeight  screenSize.Y lt height  height  screenSize.Y  2  0         var offsetWidth  screenSize.X lt width  width  screenSize.X  2  0           Set the viewport         GL.ViewportintoffsetWidth, intoffsetHeight, intscreenSize.X, intscreenSize.Y      codepre  pGetOptimalResolution returns the viewport size in order to maintain a 169 aspect ratio. Example If screensize is 1024768, it resturns 1024576 shrinking height. It then places the ortho higher in the viewport using half of the height difference as offset. This results in black bars above and below the windows.p  pThis setup works. It prevents aspect ratio issues on all resolutions. However Im questioning myself if this is the right way to do it The issues I can think of with this design  On resolutions lower then 19201080, the view is scaled down. This has an effect of how sprites look. For example, text starts to look horrible when scaled down.  If turning down resolution for performance, will this have an effect if the ortho stays the same sizep  pDid a lot of searching on this topic but so far the only things I can find is plain instructions on how to perform actions, rather then to build solutions. I also found out that using Mipmaps might solve my scaling issue. However the question remains, am I on the right track Should I look at the aspect ratio problem from a different anglep

Negative 361 pi have seen many blog entries and videos and source coude  on the internet about how to carry out camera  projector calibration using openCV, in order to produce the codecamera.ymlcode, codeprojector.ymlcode and codeprojectorExtrinsics.ymlcode files.p  pI have yet to see anyone discussing what to do with this files afterwards. Indeed I have done a calibration myself, but I dont know  what is the next step in my own application.p  pSay I write an application that now uses the camera  projector system that I calibrated to track objects and project something on them. I will use contourFind to grab some points of interest from the moving objects and now I want to project these points from the projector onto the objects p  pwhat I want to do is for example track the centre of mass COM of an object and show a point on the camera view of the tracked object at its COM. Then a point should be projected on the COM of the object in real time. p  pIt seems that codeprojectPointscode is the openCV function I should use after loading the yml files, but I am not sure how I will account for all the intrinsic amp extrinsic calibration values of both camera and projector. Namely, codeprojectPointscode requires as parameters the p  ul livector of points to reproject duhli lirotation  translation matrices. I think I can use the projectorExtrinsics here. or I can use the composeRT function to generate a final rotation amp a final translation matrix from the projectorExtrinsics which I have in the yml file and the cameraExtrinsics which I dont have. side question should I not save them too in a file. li liintrinsics matrix. this tricky now. should I use the camera or the projector intrinsics matrix hereli lidistortion coefficients. again should I use the projector or the camera coefs here li liother params...li ul  pSo If I use either projector or camera which one intrinsics  coeffs in codeprojectPointscode, then I will only be correcting for one of the 2 instruments .   Where  how will I use the others instruments intrinsics p  pWhat else do I need to use apart from  codeloadcode the yml files and codeprojectPointscode  perhaps undistortionp  pANY help on the matter is greatly appreciated . If there is a tutorial or a book no, OReilly Learning openCV does not talk about how to use the calibration yml files either   only about how to do the actual calibration, please  point me in that direction. I dont necessarily need an exact answerp

Negative 361 pHopefully someone can provide some insight on this issue. I have created an instance of an object that contains an ArrayList of information username, password, password hint. I am trying to serialize the object. It looks like it is serializing properly, but when I restart the project to deserialize, it returns null values in the ArrayList.

My expectation was that a call to longjmp would take the program state amp execution to setjmp, which is in another function. This function a, should return 3 to main. So, the if condition in main is TRUE and i should see a printout saying In main a returned nonzero.  I was not expecting the printout of  In main end because control should never reach there, according to my understanding of setjmplongjmp. p  pI suspect this could be a debugger problem, because when i step through the program without printf in function a , the debugger reaches upto longjmp in expected way. When the longjmp is executed, the debugger does not stop anywhere  it simply prints In main end and program terminates. I introduced that i in main to see if the debugger would stop at that point, before printing. But Netbeans does not stop there and the whole program finishes fast, when in step into longjmp.p  pWhat is the reason for this behavior  What is the reason for segfault, in the first case when printf is present in function a   Is the stack unwinding in such a way that the pointer str is messed up  Why   If anyone has access to a UNIX machine, i would like to see the output from that system and program behavior.

Negative 361 pSets are essentially Maps from an existential point of view. There is nothing a Map can not do which a Set can, I assume. We have these overheads of defining keyvalue pairs in Maps which is not there in the Sets.

Negative 361 pI am looking to convert a set daily maintenance window  UTC offset to the next occurrence of this maintenance window.p  pLets say a maintenance window is 10PM4AM and the UTC offset is 4. What I would like to do is generate a datetime object for both the start and end of the next occurrence of that maintenance window.p  pAs an example, if it is currently 622014 140PM with a UTC offset of 4, I would want 632014 0200AM UTC and 632014 0800AM UTCp  pAdditionally, if it is currently within the maintenance window, I would want the current window start and end.p  pie if its currently 622014 1030PM with a UTC offset of 4, I would still want 632014 0200AM UTC and 632014 0800AM UTCp  pEdit Also acceptable, and perhaps even preferred, would be the same method but with just the time instead of date. I need to be able to store it in a MySQL DB, so if there is a good way for me to do this without including date, Im open to itp
Negative 361 pI admit the main title is quite confusing. Let me explain it.p  pI have a while loop inside a try block followed by catch.

Negative 361 pI have an existing website a photo blog that loads the majority of the photos from Flickr. Id like to enhance the experience for users with high resolution screens and load higher res versions of photos, but Im not sure what would be the best way to go.p  pSince the images in question are not UI elements, there is no sensible way to solve this problem with CSS. That leaves either client side JavaScript, or a server side findandreplace for specific image patterns since they come from Flickr, its easy to detect and easy enough to figure out the url for a doublesized image.p  pFor client side, my concern is that even the regular sized images are 500800 KB in size, there there can be 1030 images per gallery, causing lots of excess bandwidth use for retina users.p  pFor server side, its obviously tricky to determine if the request comes from a retina device or not. One idea I had which I have yet to test out, was to run a JavaScript function that checks codewindow.devicePixelRatiocode and sets a cookie accordingly, and then on each successive page request the server would know if the device is high res or not. That leaves the entry page with nonretina images, but at least all the next ones will have high res images loaded right away.p  pAre there any pitfalls to this proposed solution Are there better ways to handle itp

Negative 361 pWe are developing an OCX control in VB6 environment please, dont ask why... This OCX must interface with a .net dll. So far, so good. But lately we added two properties to the main class in the dll, and need to offer to the ocx consumers access to them. We strong named the dll, unregister it with regasm, and later register it again, with codebase and tlb parameters. All went ok. But the VB6 project continues to get the previous version, so lacking the new properties. What can we do to overcome this annoyance  Of course, we unchecked the reference, store the project, close the environment, reopen it, refreshed the reference, etc at no avail. TIAp

Negative 361 pIm experimenting with a variety of techniques of putting the label for the text input box inside the box. Then the label disappears as you start typing, leaving the label in place for as long as possible before you start typing. Basecamp basecamp.com has a really good effect that I would like to emulate, but not sure how they are doing it.p  pWhen you click a text box that has a label inside it, the label doesnt go away until you start typing. That is relatively easy to script, with one catch if you click inside the text box, your cursor could appear anywhere inside the label text... at the beginning, in the middle, at the end. Or, it could even select one or more characters instead of just inserting the cursor somewhere.p  pOn the Basecamp site, you cannot select any of the label text. No matter where you click, the cursor appears at the far left beginning of the text box. Even if you doubleclick, it wont select the label text.p  pHow are they doing this Thank you.p

Negative 361 pI have been testing this code for 2 months, it is the first exercise in my tutorial to learn AngularJS. The challenge is to count all .json files in a folder and increment it with 1 so that when I save another json file it will always have a higher ID then the previous one. I am having lots of trouble with web servers, first of all NodeJS does not seem to allow JSON posts in its standard configuration. So I have found a modified webserver.js from stockoverflow from a different question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions19618010resourcesaveisnotfunctioningresource.save is not functioninga a hrefhttpsgithub.comglepretreangularseedcommit9108d8e4bf6f70a5145b836ebeae0db3f29593d7diffd169b27b604606d4223bd5d85cad7da1 relnofollowhttpsgithub.comglepretreangularseedcommit9108d8e4bf6f70a5145b836ebeae0db3f29593d7diffd169b27b604606d4223bd5d85cad7da1a I have also tried the webserver.js that came with the tutorial  a hrefhttppastebin.comCkfh4jvD relnofollowhttppastebin.comCkfh4jvDa that seemed to work better. WAMP also did not work I could not get Apache to allow JSON posts.p  pProblem is the webserver posts the json or sees the json as an object not as an array, even though I have used isArray true and I use .query instead of .get. And I have tried many other things like transformResponse []. I need the array to get .length to work Also sometimes it GETS an array and POSTS an object which it later reads as object again it is getting really weird.p  pThe code works sometimes as posted or sometimes I need to change id to id.json, usually this means the server is retrieving it as an object again which is not what I wan but this differs between the 2 nodeJS servers.p  precode.factoryeventData, [resource, q, function resource, q              var resource  resourceappdataeventid, id id, getAll method    GET, isArray true             var number  resource.query             console.lognumber             return                  getEvent function                       var deferred  q.defer                     resource.getid 1,                     function event                          deferred.resolveevent                     ,                             function response                                  deferred.rejectresponse                                                  return deferred.promise                 ,                 save function event                      var deferred  q.defer                     event.id  number.length                     resource.saveevent,                             function response                                  deferred.resolveresponse                              ,                             function response                                  deferred.rejectresponse                                                                       return deferred.promise                                       ] codepre  pEDIT This seems to work better however I need to figure out how to put an .then into this servicep  precode.factoryeventData, [resource, q, function resource, q              var resource  resourceappdataeventid.json,                 id id, method getTask, q  ,                 query  method get             var number  resource.query codepre

Negative 361 pI am using ngrepeat for iterating through a list of objects, and for each item in the list there are child objects which are edited in a Bootstrap modal popup. I am unable to use the Angular modal service as it conflicts with the Bootstrap CSS already in use on the page. Angular modals would let me take values back from the modal popup on modal close, but I am unable to use it due to existing code.p  pTo work around this problem, I am passing the child object to the function that opens the modal popup.  In this function, I assign this passed object to an Angular modeljQuery Object say x either way I tried, it gives same result so that I can update this new object x with the changes done in the modal popup.p  pI believe that these variables as copied and points to the same object, when I update one, it should update the other one and so my original Angular model should be updated as well. But, to my surprise, the original model is not updating until I open the modal popup again. When I open the modal popup again, it does not update variable x but merely is updated with the ngmodel I use on page.p  pTo debug this further, I printed my ngmodel on page and it is not updated till modal popup is opened again. To contrast this further if I alert length of this ngmodel, it is updated shows the changes I made in modal popup but the ngmodel object on page does not show new values.p  pI understand this is more of a theory and less code but I am not sure what part of my code would help find the problem. Kindly let me know and I will try sanitize my code and share.p  pUpdate While further digging, it looks like the model is updated but it did not reflect on page. So if for example on page I have condition that if no child objects, show Add button edit otherwise, it does not change from add to edit button when I open modal first time and add values to child objects. When I open modal popup again, it changes link from add to edit even if I close modal popup without changes. So it is a problem with screen refreshing as such my model updates reflecting on screen instead of actual model update.p

Negative 361 pI had a table which was having a global indexbtree on a date column. We created range partition on it for a better retrieval performance. The partition key we used is the same column which has indexes on it. Later we moved the global indexes to local by dropping the recreating the local index on same date column.p  pNow we have local index and partition key on same column.But after this the dataload into this table is taking three times more of the usual time p  pWhat could be the reason that if the partition key and local index are on the same column of the table then the dataload takes more time When we checked the explain plan , we figured that the queries are not using local indexes. why it does not use the local index in this case is there any hidden inbuilt indexes attached with the partion key as well , which oracle uses in place of the local index What could be solution to this so the performance of dataload doesnot get impacted Any leads on this would be highly appreciated.p

Negative 361 pI am developing CANTCPIP transparent gateway device. The idea is to connect 2 geographically distributed CAN busses over internet. Transparent here means that the gateway does not terminate and parse CAN frames. Just commutate and incapsulate into IP datagrams. The CAN nodes should not feel the gateway influence, but think that it is single pure CAN bus.  CAN Time Triggered mode support is not needed. p  pThe CAN devices which my gateway will deal with are third party products. They work as is. The CAN communication is bidirectional  not only listening, but requestresponse.p  pstrongThe issuestrong  The 3rd party CAN devices has internal timers which limit the time of waiting for the answers for their requests. The timers are software and requests are high level. The limits are fixed and about 100200 ms. It exceeds the Internet RTT Round Trip Time. So I need to trick the devices, but not loosing the transparancy I described above.p  pThe solution may look like some CAN bus flow control, the appeal to wait, but some legitimate way. But pure CAN does not suggest such mechanisms. p  pI studied the articles about the analogous applications. Their authors uses CAN flow control frames described in ISO157652.  This approach solves the RTT issue even for GPRS3G narrowband connections. But I can not do this because it is prerogative of CAN nodes which are 3rd party and out of my authority.   p  pI am not sure that the solution exists. But I am ready to try any sudden ideas.p

The problem is, Im not actually reading and writing from the strongsamestrong Stream in that case at least I think so. Because since I await for the recently created task that writes to the input stream to end before calling CopyToAsync which obviously performs Reads to this Stream internally, the read only starts after the write has ended. So I dont see why this could cause a deadlock since I never read and write from the same Stream at the same time.p  pI dont know if that matters, but as a side note, my QuerySync method is completely synchronous, as the client Im using to get responses currently does not support asynchronous requests.p

Negative 361 pI know this question has been asked in the past but none of the responses i have seen to date seem to solve my problem. p  pI am attempting to handle push notifications in the background on my iOS app, but for some reason the didReceiveRemoteNotificationfetchCompletionHandler method only gets invoked in debug mode when the app is connected to xcode. p  pI am sending the notifications using PushSharp, and i have tried pretty much everything. I set contentavailable to 1, tried setting soundalert to , and even tried setting the priority to 1, 5, and 10 i know its the default but worth a shot but to no avail.p  pWhen i launch the app from xcode and press the home button, i am able to get the method to invoke by sending a push notification. However, if i stop the app, start it again on the device, press the home button, and send a push notification, the method never gets called. p  pDoes anyone have any suggestionsp

Negative 361 pIm using php my get results from a mysql table. I want to run multiple conditional statements to return a list of unique results. lets say I have a table about houses on my street and my table looks like thisp  precodeHouse Number  Attribute  Value  23            Colour     White 23            Stories    2 24            Stories    1 25            Colour     Blue codepre  pNotice house number 23 appears twice How would I word a mysql query to return all houses that are white AND have two stories in this case, it would return just one result  23.p  pI hear what youre saying  why dont i just make colour and stories the column names. well, the reason is because in my example, a house can have two different colours two different values for the same attribute name. A house could have two rows, one where attribute is colour and value is white, and another where attribute is also colour but the value is purple. As long as a house has a row with colourwhite AND a row with stories2 it will return positive in the query and get included in the resultp  pNow, once solution would be to run two different queries one query that matches white houses and returns an array, and a second query that matches houses with two stories and returns an array, then I can use php to compare the two arrays and see what entries appear in both arrays, pull them out and put them into a final array. But this involves calling two mysql queries. Is there a way of combining the queries on the mysql endp

Negative 361 pWorking with Bayesian networks. I take a given network structure and fit its parameters on data. I am looking for a statistic based on those parameter estimates that allows me to compare Markov blankets within the network. I want this stat to reflect the strength of mutual dependence between all the nodes in the MB, in a way that is comparable to all the other MBs in the network. In the end, I want a visualization that looks like this a hrefhttpsimgur.comSzyWP3D relnofollowheat mapa, where more yellow the MB the greater the strength of conditional dependence. Using likelihoodbased stats doesnt work because each MB contains different sets and counts of variables. Two things I came up with were calculating a hrefhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiTotalcorrelation relnofollowtotal correlationa calculated from probability queries on the fitted network. Another is calculating an estimate for Bayes error of a node given its MB, as a quantification for how well an MB can predict its core node. But I feel this cant be a new problem.

Negative 361 pI would like to build a web application including server and database component, package it and ship it as desktop application. The application should give a native desktop app feel and work even when no internet is available.  When internet is available, the data should be able to sync solicited and unsolicited to a hosted web server Syncing at the database level.p  pI investigated the chrome packaged apps, which can launch the HTML5, css3 and Javascript based UI apps without the need of a browser, using webkit.  The point i am not clear of is whether the packaged apps will be able to package the server and database component as well Or should i be using separate packaging to install the server and database.  I prefer it to be a single package installation.p  pI can think of using .NetSwingXJava FXAdobe AIR to develop a desktop app, but one of the farsighted goal is to project our solution in a SaaS model so i like to stick to web app only.p  pI know it is not a tech specific question rather based on choosing and defining right tool and architecture. I have searched on web and did not find a concrete solution to this use case. p

Negative 361 pWe have built a MVC 3 application and configured AD to store the user details. We have a login window to log on to the application. p  pWe have a requirement, where ADMIN will reset the password and he will issue a temporary password to the user via phone. When user logs in next time we have to prompt him to reset the password. p  pTechnically we can achieve this by two approach.p  ol liBy setting codepwdLastSetcode property of codeADcode to code0code li liBy having a flag in a DB to reset the password next time.li ol  pI want to go with the first approach. But the problem is When admin resets the password, we are seting pwdLastSet to 0. And next time when user tries to login with valid username and wrong password we are end up showing the password reset window. p  pFor example  For codeUSER Acode codeadmincode resets the codepasswordcode and he shares the password to codeUSER Acode  Lets say Password is  codesimplepasswordcodep  pNow codeUSER Acode logs in with following password  codewrongpasswordcode. p  pThe system will show the reset password window and he can reset the password with any password. This is a security breach. p  pProblem is, We dont have any property to validate the Username and Password. From my analysis what i found is, after setting codepwdLastSetcode to code0code the password will no more valid. IT will start throwing exception. p  pCould any one tell me the approach where i can use codeADcode property to validate the old password and a flag to prompt to open the reset password window. p  pYour help appreciated...p  pThanks.p

Negative 361 pI have a chain of C applicationsservices communicating through WCF, and one MVC web application that can sometimes instigate actions along this chain of services.p  pWhat I want is a strongsafestrong way of reporting strongusefulstrong errors that happened along this chain, once a web app user instigated an action that resulted in an exception. My current solution is catching any Exception as soon as possible, then creating a CustomException with a custom message that best identifies the causing problem. This CustomException will propagate up the service chain serialized at the service boundaries using a code[FaultContract typeofSerialisedCustomException]code by trycatch blocks. When an Exception is caught at any point, if it is of type CustomException itll be rethrown. Otherwise a CustomException will be created on the spot, as above, then thrown further.p  pAs a usecase, lets assume that a user logged in to my web application A performs an action which tells service B to tell service C to create a file on Cs filesystem. the actual actions are more complex than this, and more than one thing can go wrong, but I think this is a sufficient examplep  pIf anything goes wrong along the way, I want the user to be informed of it in such a way that he can remedy the problem.p  pBy strongsafestrong, I want only errors that I have specifically created hence my usage of a CustomException be shown to the user, and nothing else if a System exception, say UnauthorizedAccessException, gets thrown, I will wrap it in my own CustomException and only show the enduser the message of my own CustomException. I do not want any Exception messages that potentially expose implementation details be shown to the user.p  pBy strongusefulstrong, I want to show the user an appropriate message and suggestion, such as emmake sure you have the right permissions etc.em, as opposed to emService B says Internal Server Error.em These would be set the moment the CustomException is first thrown, and not altered on further catchthrows. If debugging is enabled, Ill be also displaying a stacktrace, but in production I will only show my safe custom message.p  pThe problem with my approach is that the more and more I write trycatch blocks around my service methods, and in the methods they are calling, and so on, the eeriest I feel that this is not the right way to go, and that theres a better, more efficientless bloated solution out there.p  pIs there anything that solves this problem while also avoiding the overhead of wrapping everything in trycatch blocks p  pEdit Added justification for the need of reporting the errors rather than saying emSomething went wrong, were looking into it.emp  pMy web app can instigate complex and customizable actions on the lowerlevel services. These can fail for plenty of reasons which can be fixed by tweaking the customization of that action.p  pAs an example, lets say I have an action that copies a a userinputted source file to a userinputted destination on machine C, or on a network drive accessible to machine C. For various reasons file not found, network down, lack of permissions, not enough disk space etc., this action might fail, but some of the reasons could be fixed by the user changing that custom action, if only they were able to see why it failed in the first place.p
Negative 361 pIm sorta new here so if this isnt the place to ask it, please tell mep  pNormally I add codeltlink hrefhttpfonts.googleapis.comcssfamilyOpenSans300italic,400,400italic,700 relstylesheet typetextcssgtcode into the codeltheadgtcode of my page.

Negative 361 pI am looking at a form that has a a hrefhttpwww.captcha.net relnofollowcaptchaa. The CSS being applied has made it all whacky looking. Im about to diagnose the issue, and Im looking at the styles being applied in my Google chrome developer window. For each individual rule, there is light grey text in the top right of the box that says where the code came from. The one rule Im interested in indicates it came from codeltstylegtltstylegtcode, which I assume is an inline style rule. Clicking on the source, it takes me to the codeltstylegtcode element that is defined and sure enough the rules are there. These rules dont exist in the source file, so Im pretty sure the element is appended through javascript. When I hit codectrl  ucode to view the source code, the codeltstylegtcode element is not there.p  pHow can I see an element that exists in the developer window without it existing in the view source codep
Negative 361 pI want to work in a project for enterprises. But I dont know that is most recommendable. For example, it is better that my rails app to strongcreate a database per enterprisestrong when these create a account. I am thinking this because if a day the database of an enterprise have a problem not affect to other enterprises.p  pI want to do a project in which each time a company signs up this using your strongown databasestrong. In simple terms I do not want to cross the data, therefore, if a user has two companies for example can handle separately and stored in separate databases. This practice I have seen in the ERP software, where the person buying the product can manage your different businesses. Obviously the database will have the same design in common for all, but its like creating two instances of the database in simple words.p  pThanksp

Negative 361 pIs it possible to edit a php file from itself I would like to have a php file that a user can log into with their email address and password then give them a several fields they can edit. Upon submitting their entries the actual php file they used to submit info is updated.p  pLets say there are three fields displayed once logged in...  1. Email can not be read when rendered in a browser or via source code  2. Password can not be read when rendered in a browser or via source code  3. Textarea contents you submit in the textarea would be visible if you load page in browser, in addtion, a blank username and password field would be visible in a browser, so the owner could login to edit the filep  pWith this system the user would be able to edit their login information and change information displayed on the page when viewed through a browser.

Negative 361 pFirst of all, please see the layout of the project a hrefhttpi58.tinypic.comopra6a.png relnofollowherea. Briefly, each input deviceswitch, button has one output pin and each output deviceled has one input pin. Logic gates consist of 2 input pins and 1 output pin. These pins are defined as separate classes that extends the same parent class Wires connect two terminal pins outputinput and defined as separate class that holds the local instances of these pins. Logic gates, input and output devices and wires are kept in different array lists. I handled the GUI part of the project which is shown a hrefhttpi59.tinypic.com34qmybr.png relnofollowherea and which will hopefully give you an idea about the wires and terminal pins. p  pWhat I want to do is to implement an algorithm that takes the value at the output pin of the inputs, process them at logic gates and carry the result to output. Before setting the output of logic gates, I need to make sure that input pins of these logic gates are set correctly. So, what is the right way to do it and please note that there will be unknown number of input devices, logic gates and output devices How can I make sure that all the pins are set correctly For example if I have switch1 and 2ANDswitch3ORled in the circuit then I need to set the input pins of the AND gate firstaccording to switch 1 and 2 then carry the result of it to one of the input pins of OR other pin will be connected to switch 3 then process the result and carry it to the LED.     p

Negative 361 pThe Braintree API docs arent entirely clear on a few things dealing with subscriptions.p  pWere building a system with multiple subscription tiers and want to give the user the ability to change tiers at any time. Updating the subscription is easy enough, and weve enabled prorated billing though were still not entirely clear on what Braintree is doing under the hood there.p  pThe part Im not seeing is how to update the price. If I change the plan id, the price does not change. I would expect the subscription to use the new plans price  I cant imagine when it would ever make sense to emnotem update the price. I see that I can pass a new price along with a new plan id, so I can update the price in the same call that I update the plan, but this means I have to store the price in my code as well as in Braintree. I know I can call the plans on Braintree to get the price information, but it should not be necessary to add the overhead of an additional API call.p  pAm I overlooking something Is there really not a way to tell Braintree to use the price of the new subscriptionp

Negative 361 pWhen I use RestTemplate of spring framework to connect to my web service which is secured by HTTPS with client authentication by spring security through Restful API, I found problem to use POST method.

During my testing, I use the following MyX509AuthenticationFilter for debugging purpose. p  precodepublic class MyX509AuthenticationFilter extends X509AuthenticationFilter  private static final Logger LOGGER  LoggerFactory.getLoggerMyX509AuthenticationFilter.class  protected Object getPreAuthenticatedPrincipalHttpServletRequest request       X509Certificate[] certs  X509Certificate[] request.getAttributejavax.servlet.request.X509Certificate      if certs  null ampamp certs.length gt 0          LOGGER.debugX.509 client authentication certificate  certs[0]      else          LOGGER.debugNo client certificate found in request.           return super.getPreAuthenticatedPrincipalrequest    codepre  pIn order to further debug the request. I have added the following servlet filter in web.xml before spring security to print out the client certificate.p  precodepublic class MyRequestFilter implements Filter  Logger LOGGER  LoggerFactory.getLoggerMyRequestFilter.class  Override public void doFilterServletRequest servletRequest, ServletResponse servletResponse, FilterChain filterChain         throws IOException, ServletException      LOGGER.debugMyRequestFilter doFilter Entering      if servletRequest instanceof HttpServletRequest          HttpServletRequest httpServletRequest  HttpServletRequest servletRequest         String requestURI  httpServletRequest.getRequestURI         String queryString  httpServletRequest.getQueryString         StringBuffer requestURL  httpServletRequest.getRequestURL          LOGGER.debugrequestURI gt  requestURI  lt         LOGGER.debugqueryString gt  queryString  lt         LOGGER.debugrequestURL gt  requestURL.toString  lt          X509Certificate[] certs  X509Certificate[] httpServletRequest                 .getAttributejavax.servlet.request.X509Certificate          if certs  null ampamp certs.length gt 0              LOGGER.debugX.509 client authentication certificate  certs[0]          else              LOGGER.debugNo client certificate found in request.                else          LOGGER.debugget non HttpServletRequest  servletRequest           filterChain.doFilterservletRequest, servletResponse   codepre  pIn order to use client authentication, I have also setup the tomcat to use client authentication and the following line is added to the server.xml.p  precode    ltConnector SSLEnabledtrue acceptCount100 clientAuthtrue         disableUploadTimeouttrue enableLookupsfalse keyAliasabcServer         keypasspassword keystoreFiletomcat8Cert2.jks keystorePasspassword         maxHttpHeaderSize8192 maxSpareThreads75 maxThreads150         minSpareThreads25 port443 schemehttps securetrue         sslProtocolTLS truststoreFiletrustStoreCert2.jks         truststorePasspassword gt codepre  pBy using the above program and configuration, if I involve web service through GET method, everything work fine. However, if I involve web service through POST method, the MyRequestFilter can print out the certificate with the correct CN, but the MyX509AuthenticationFilter has not printed out anything and spring security just return org.springframework.web.client.HttpClientErrorException 403 Forbidden. This exception should come from  Http403ForbiddenEntryPoint of spring security. p  pI have further test the same web service after comment out spring security filter in my web.xml of the server side and involve it through the same client code. It work. Hence, I suspect something wrong with my setting that make the spring security cannot work property with the POST method to do the client certificate authentication.

Negative 361 pI am attempting to construct a neural network incorporating convolution and LSTM using the Torch library to be trained by Qlearning or Advantagelearning, both of which require propagating state T1 through the network before updating the weights for state T.p  pHaving to do an extra propagation would cut performance and thats bad, but not emtooem bad However, the problem is that there is all kinds of state bound up in this. First of all, the Torch implementation of backpropagation has some efficiency shortcuts that rely on the back propagation happening immediately after the forward propagation, which an additional propagation would mess up. I could possibly get around this by having a secondary cloned network sharing the weight values, but we come to the second problem.p  pEvery forward propagation involving LSTMs is stateful. How can I update the weights at T1 when propagating networkT1 may have changed the contents of the LSTMs I have tried to look at the discussion of TD weight updates as done in TDGammon, but its obtuse to me and thats for feedforward anyway, not recurrent.p  pHow can I update the weights of a network at T without having to advance the network to T1, or how do I advance the network to T1 and then go back and adjust the weights as if it were still Tp

Negative 361 pCould i know if there is a provision of having multiple range key conditions for the same hash key. For example,if the hash key is locality  and rangekey is shopNo. Then could we have the below  keyconditionsetp  precodegtHashKeyCondition locality EQ  NewYork   gtRangeKeyCondition1 shopNo BETWEEN  1 to 10   gtRangeKeyCondition2 shopNo BETWEEN  20 to 30 codepre  pWhen the above was tried, it was considering only one rangeKeyCondition . Is there any way that we can achieve giving two rangekeyconditions for the same hashkey. I am supposing that it could be possible since for a given hashkey, all the rangekeys under this partition are indexed via a sortedindex.p  pI can see this can be achieved using a QueryFilter with OR ConditionalOperator but the filter is applied after the keybased retrieval and before the results are returned to you. This may not be efficient, as getting all shopNos for a locallity and then performing a filter could be slower than getting the only items which satisfy the provided multiple rangekey conditionsp  pCould anyone advice on how can this be achievedp  pThanks.p

Negative 361 pI am building an online community, where users have a news feed, in which activities of other users they follow as well as tagged posts will be aggregated. Posts are tagged, by entering 1 tags in a dedicated tagsfield, as here on StackOverflow. Users can individually define, which sets of tags they wish to follow, i.e. when I follow the sets hiking, germany and movies, 60s, crime, then only posts containing both tags from the first or all three tags from the second set are shown. Posts with further tags are included, too. Posts with less tags are ignored.p  pI am wondering how to implement this beast efficiently and have already spent quite some time in understanding how activity feeds, twitter, tumblr, pinterest, instagram, etc. all work in the background. I favor the idea of having a Redis cache with, lets say 1000 entries per user, to cache the latest 1000 aggregated items in the complex feed. However, I am curious what to do when a user scrolls to the end of the cached feed. strongHow do I implement the fallback ideallystrongp  pDue to the nature of allowing multiple and quite many different tag sets to follow, querying in MySQL is fairly slow, because i need a lot of joins one subquery and join per tag set, joint with the users i follow, grouping and sorting the results, limiting and offsetting for a paged view, etc..p  pBuilding materialized views in a bigdatadatabase cassandra, hbase, ... upfront for each and every combination of tags there is, also seems like overkill.p  pCurrently I favor with either building a materialized time series for every tag set a user defines, initialized in the background, keeping it, until the user drops this tag set. Or using Elasticsearch or Solr to achieve aforementioned complex queries on the fly, once a user reaches the end of the cached stream.p  pWhat do you reckon would be better suited in general Sadly, only very few of the found papers, slides, talks or interviews about other technology stacks cover this topic of the fallback issue.p

I have created custom role provider to access the roles.p  pFor example active directory group is domainIT  and roles are developer, qa, ba, analyst Below is my current configurationp  precodeltsystem.webgt lthttpRuntime targetFramework4.5.1 maxRequestLength1024 gt ltauthentication modeWindows gt ltauthorizationgt   ltallow rolesdomainIT gt   ltdeny users gt ltauthorizationgt  ltroleManager defaultProviderMySqlRoleProvider    enabledtrue    cacheRolesInCookietrue    cookieName.ASPROLES    cookieTimeout30    cookiePath    cookieRequireSSLfalse    cookieSlidingExpirationtrue    cookieProtectionEncryptiongt    ltprovidersgt     ltadd       nameMySqlRoleProvider        typeMyProviders.MySqlRoleProvider,MyProviders       connectionStringNameMyConnectionStringName       applicationNameMyApp gt   ltprovidersgt  ltroleManagergt codepre  pp  pOn application startup, MySqlRoleProvider.GetRolesForUser gets invoked by .net framework and it tries to see if user is in domainIT. However domainIT is not a role its an active directory group So framework denies the access and I get windows login prompt again. and keeps asking for credentials because it goes through the same cyclebr So Im not sure how can I tell framework not to invoke custom role provider when its looking if user is in active directory group. p  pEDITbr If I remove role provide from configuration then user gets authenticated without any issue.p

Negative 361 pMy question has to do with postprocessing of partofspeech tagged and parsed natural language sentences.  Specifically, I am writing a component of a Lisp postprocessor that takes as input a sentence parse tree such as, for example, one produced by the Stanford Parser, extracts from that parse tree the phrase structure rules invoked to generate the parse, and then produces a table of rules and rule counts.  An example of input and output would be the followingp  p1  Sentencep  precodeJohn said that he knows who Mary likes codepre  p2  Parser outputp  precodeROOT   S     NP NNP John     VP VBD said       SBAR IN that         S           NP PRP he           VP VBZ knows             SBAR               WHNP WP who               S                 NP NNP Mary                 VP VBZ likes codepre  p3  My Lisp program postprocessor output for this parse treep  precodeS gt NP VP             3 NP gt NNP              2 VP gt VBZ              1 WHNP gt WP             1 SBAR gt WHNP S         1 VP gt VBZ SBAR         1 NP gt PRP              1 SBAR gt IN S           1 VP gt VBD SBAR         1 ROOT gt S              1 codepre  pNote the lack of punctuation in sentence 1.  Thats intentional.  I am having trouble parsing the punctuation in Lisp  precisely because some punctuation commas, for example are reserved for special purposes.  But parsing sentences without punctuation changes the distribution of the parse rules as well as the symbols contained in those rules, as illustrated by the followingp  p4  Input sentencep  precodeI said no and then I did it anyway codepre  p5  Parser outputp  precodeROOT   S     NP PRP I     VP VBD said       ADVP RB no         CC and         RB then       SBAR         S           NP PRP I           VP VBD did             NP PRP it             ADVP RB anyway codepre  p6  Input sentence with punctuationp  precodeI said no, and then I did it anyway. codepre  p7  Parser outputp  precode ROOT    S      S        NP PRP I        VP VBD said          INTJ UH no      , ,      CC and      S        ADVP RB then        NP PRP I        VP VBD did          NP PRP it          ADVP RB anyway      . . codepre  pNote how including punctuation completely rearranges the parse tree and also involves different POS tags and thus, implies that different grammar rules were invoked to produce it  So including punctuation is important, at least for my application.p  pWhat I need is to discover a way to include punctuation in rules, so that I can produce rules like the following, which would appear, for example, in the table like 3, as followsp  p8  Desired rulep  precodeS gt S , CC S . codepre  pRules like 8 are in fact desired for the specific application I am writing.p  pBut I am finding that doing this in Lisp is difficult  In 7, for example, we observe the appearance of , , and . . , both of which are problematic to handle in Lisp.p  pI have included my relevant Lisp code below.  Please note that Im a neophyte Lisp hacker and so my code isnt particularly pretty or efficient.
