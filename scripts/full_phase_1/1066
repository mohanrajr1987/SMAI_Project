Positive 1066 pIm setting up a continuous integration CI server for our iOS app using Xcode Server. The problem is we have a plist, codecred.plistcode for each person with their credentials and test environment details that is ignored by git and the application will not compile and run without it. There is a file codecreddist.plistcode that is used to update codecred.plistcode that will work for our CI purposes and I would like to renamecopy it before integration and name it cred.plist. Both files in the project are in the root directory. p I have tried adding scripts to the CI target and to the bot itself to no avail. Below is an example of an attempt from the bot Before Integration script section as well as the error message I receive. I have tried nearly every directory variable I could find including the codeXCScode prefix ones, just a slash, and no prefix. p The bot successfully pulls the code from our repo and builds up to the point that the plist is required, then errors.  p Any suggestions or help would be greatly appreciated Thanksp  pp Scriptp  precode binbash  cp a TMPDIRcreddist.plist TMPDIRcred.plist codepre  pp Errorp  precodeAssertion Reading data The file cred.plist couldnt be opened because there is no such file.

Positive 1066 pSonar analysis is a nice way to check code compliance against a centrally defined policy.

Positive 1066 pI have a SQL Server hosting a database, running in an Amazon AWS EC2 instance, with 900gb not using RDS of data. Continuous deployments involve console apps doing API calls to replicate the AMIs of the instance and associated EBS volumes, pushing MSIs to run unattended changes. If deployment and tests are successful, clients are pointed to the new database. This gives ability to know how changes will affect the real row content. Ops staff do deployments, developers have no hand in productionregion management tasks. Visual Studio is not used.p  pHow would something similar be done with SQLAzure From an abstract level, the solution needed is a way to fully copy a complete database configuration as well as all schemata with content.

Negative 1066 pI have a web application that allows a user to search on some criteria, select an object, edit it and then return to the previous search.

The best option I came up with is to use a NameValue collection of each of the selected paramters and store that to Session or a cookie when the user presses the search button.

Negative 1066 pBefore I write my own I will ask all yall.p  pIm looking for a C class that is almost exactly like a STL vector but stores data into an array on the stack.  Some kind of STL allocator class would work also, but I am trying to avoid any kind of heap, even static allocated perthread heaps although one of those is my second choice.  The stack is just more efficient.p  pIt needs to be almost a drop in replacement for current code that uses a vector.p  pFor what I was about to write myself I was thinking of something like thisp  precodechar buffer[4096] stackvectorltmatchitemgt matchesbuffer, sizeofbuffer codepre  pOr the class could have buffer space allocated internally.  Then it would look likep  precodestackvectorltmatchitem, 256gt matches codepre  pI was thinking it would throw stdbadalloc if it runs out of space, although that should not ever happen.p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pUsing Chromiums stackcontainer.h works great  p  pThe reason I hadnt thought of doing it this way myself is that I have always overlooked the allocator object parameter to the STL collection constructors.  I have used the template parameter a few times to do static pools but Id never seen code or written any that actually used the object parameter.  I learned something new.  Very coolp  pThe code is a bit messy and for some reason GCC forced me to declare the allocator as an actual item instead of constructing it into vectors allocator parameter.  It went from something like thisp  precodetypedef stdpairlt const char , const char  gt complistitem typedef stdvectorlt complistitem gt complisttype  complisttype matchlist matchlist.reserve32 codepre  pTo thisp  precodestatic const sizet complistallocsize  128 typedef stdpairlt const char , const char  gt complistitem typedef StackAllocatorlt complistitem, complistallocsize gt complistalloctype typedef stdvectorlt complistitem, complistalloctype gt complisttype  complistalloctypeSource matchlistbuffer complistalloctype matchlistalloc ampmatchlistbuffer  complisttype matchlist matchlistalloc  matchlist.reserve complistallocsize  codepre  pAnd I have to repeat that whenever I declare a new one.  But it works just like I wanted.p  pI noticed that stackcontainer.h has a StackVector defined and I tried using it.  But it doesnt inherit from vector or define the same methods so it wasnt a dropin replacement.  I didnt want to rewrite all the code using the vector so I gave up on it.p
Negative 1066 pIve had to create a custom membership provider for my current ASP .Net project in order to fit in with our database schema, and am having problems configuring it to lockout a user if they get their password wrong three times, as is supported by the standard providers.p  pIs this something I need to implement myself, or should it be supported inherentlyp  pI have no code that specifically deals with it and none of the interface members seem to deal with it specifically, but if I need to implement it myself, how do I go about informing the user they are locked out Do I need to raise some sort of exception in ValidateUserp  pstrongSolutionstrongp  pShame I cant mark two answers, the links provided by Dave R give a great in depth look at how membership works, and what Zhaph pointed out was just what I ended up doing, handling the locked out logic in the custom membership provider.p  pI then handled the error condition by using the Login controls LoginError event and checked in there to see if the user was locked out in order to show the appropriate error message.p

Negative 1066 pI read somewhere that one of few weaknesses in data binding model is that you never explicitly handle or create the data object thats bound to the control and as a result you dont have a chance to add an extra item.

If there is no dependencies between the two, then there is no performance hits if these relationships do not match Is that correctp  pThe concern from my view is that the development team spends a lot of time tuning the hibernate queriesobjects but nothing at the database layer to improve the performance of the application.  I would have assumed that they would tune at both layers.p  pCould these issue be from just a poor initial design of the database to begin with and trying to covermake up the difference by the use of Hibernatep  pI am new to this project so playing catchupp

Negative 1066 pMy understanding of a emfactoryem is that it encapsulates instantiation of concrete classes that all inherit a common abstract class or interface. This allows the client to be decoupled from the process of determining which concrete class to create, which in turn means you can add or remove concrete classes from your program without having to change the clients code. You might have to change the factory, but the factory is purpose built and really only has one reason to changea concrete class has been addedremoved.p  pI have built some classes that do in fact encapsulate object instantiation but for a different reason the objects are hard to instantiate. For the moment, Im calling these classes factories, but Im concerned that might be a misnomer and would confuse other programmers who might look at my code. My factory classes dont decide which concrete class to instantiate, they guarantee that a series of objects will be instantiated in the correct order and that the right classes will be passed into the right constructors when I call codenewcode.p  pFor example, for an MVVM project Im working on, I wrote a class to ensure that my codeSetupViewcode gets instantiated properly. It looks something like thisp  precodepublic class SetupViewFactory      public SetupView CreateViewDatabaseModel databaseModel, SettingsModel settingsModel, ViewUtilities viewUtilities              var setupViewModel  new SetupViewModeldatabaseModel, settingsModel, viewUtilities         var setupView  new SetupView         setupView.DataContext  setupViewModel         return setupView       codepre  pstrongIs it confusing to call this a factorystrong It doesnt decide among several possible concrete classes, and its return type is not an interface or abstract type, but it does encapsulate object instantiation.p  pIf its not a factory, what is itp  phrp  pstrongEditstrongp  pA number of people have suggested that this is actually the Builder Pattern.p  pThe definition of the Builder Pattern from a hrefhttpwww.dofactory.compatternsPatternBuilder.aspx5Fself2 relnofollowdofactorya is as followsp  blockquote   pSeparate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.p blockquote  pThis seems like a little bit of a stretch also. The thing that bothers me is the different representations. My purpose is not to abstract the process of building a View not that that isnt a worthy goal. Im simply trying to put the logic for creating a specific view in one place, so that if any of the ingredients or the process for creating that view change, I only have to change this one class. The builder pattern really seems to be saying, Lets create a general process for making Views, then you can follow that same basic process for any View you create. Nice, but thats just not what Im doing here.p  phrp  pstrongEdit 2strongp  pI just found an interesting example in a a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiDependency5Finjection relnofollowWikipedia article on Dependency Injectiona.p  pUnder Manually Injected Dependency, it contains the following classp  precodepublic class CarFactory       public static Car buildCar          return new Carnew SimpleEngine        codepre  pThis is almost emexactlyem the usage I have and, no, I did not write the wiki article .p  pInterestingly, this is the comment following this codep  blockquote   pIn the code above, the factory takes responsibility for assembling the car, and injects the engine into the car. This frees the car from knowing about how to create an engine, though now the CarFactory has to know about the engines construction. One could create an EngineFactory, but that merely creates dependencies among factories. So the problem remains, but has at least been shifted into strongfactoriesstrong, or strongbuilderstrong objects. [my emphasis]p blockquote  pSo, this tells me that at least Im not the only one whos thought of creating a class to help with injecting stuff into another class, and Im not the only one who attempted to name this class a factory.p

Negative 1066 pAre there any bestpraticespatterns or general advice for partitioning large amounts of hierarchical datap  pThink of, say, a database of all the people in a given country and tracking who has worked with who.  Thinking of the person entities in isolation, if a lot of data were to be kept about each person then a natural approach seems to be to divide the population across multiple horizontal partitions.  However, the relations who worked with who could and will cross partitionsa.  Clustering on these relations ie. using employer for example as the partition key in order to minimize crosspartitionreferences wont be viable over time as the data becomes more and more crosslinked.  Such clustering would also result in unbalanced partitions which would hamper scalability.p  pIm rather stuck right now, so would be very greatful for any help offered.p  pThanks.p
Negative 1066 pI keep running into all sorts of nuances between the web site project versus web application project  here is the latest for mep  pIve inherited a Visual Studio 2005 solution with several class library projects a DAL.dll, a Biz.dll, etc. but this is all fronted by a strongweb site projectstrong rather than a web app project.p  pWhile the strongweb app projectstrong provides a Platform Target dropdown list Any CPU, x86, x64, the poor strongweb site projectstrong appears to offer nothing like that. strongIs there a way to ensure the web site runs as x86strong when hosted on a 64bit IIS machine p  p..The bigger picture of why I am asking thisp  pThe website runs on a 64bit machine Win Server 2003 and em[I have just learned]em cannot load a 32bit COM object which I believe has been wrapped with a Runtime Callable Wrapper. Because it cannot load this piece, a web.config setting is set to avoid the runtime load error by bypassing the load of this 32bit dll but all of the functionality of COM dll is therefore lost when the site is running on a 64 bit machine. p  pSo, in summary, I presume the web site on the 64bit machine must be running in IIS as a 64bit app and that if I could just get the site to run as 32bit instead, then it strongcouldstrong load the COM dll and therefore execute that functionality of the application. p  pNOTE I have been and still am doing research here in preparation for a quick uptake when I get access to the actual development environment so much of my question is based on piecing together parts of my [anticipated] problems to be faced soon.

Negative 1066 pThis programming problem is 85 from a hrefhttphalcyon.usc.edukiranmsqs.html relnofollowa page of Microsoft interview questionsa. The complete problem description and my solution are posted below, but I wanted to ask my question first.p  pThe rules say that you can loop for a fixed number of times. That is, if x is a variable, you can loop over a block of code based on the value of x at the time that you enter the loop. If x changes during the loop, that wont change how many times you loop. Also, that is the only way to loop. You cant, for instance, loop until some condition is met.p  pIn my solution to the problem, I have a loop which will be set to execute zero or more times. The problem is, in reality, it only ever executes 0 times or 1 time because the only statement in my loop is a return statement. So if we enter the loop, it only has a chance to run once. I am using this tactic instead of using an ifelse block, because logical comparisons and if statements are not allowed. The rules dont explicitly say that you cant do this, but I am wondering if you would consider my solution invalid. I couldnt really figure out another way to do it.p  pSo here are my questionsp  ul liDo you think my solution is invalidli liIf so, did you think of another way to solve the problemli ul  pstrongProblem descriptionstrongp  blockquote   p85 You have an abstract computer, so just forget everything you know   about computers, this one only does what Im about to tell you it   does. You can use as many variables as you need, there are no negative   numbers, all numbers are integers. You do not know the size of the   integers, they could be infinitely large, so you cant count on   truncating at any point. There are NO comparisons allowed, no if   statements or anything like that. There are only four operations you   can do on a variable.p      ol   liYou can set a variable to 0.li   liYou can set a variable  another variable.li   liYou can increment a variable only by 1, and its a post increment.li   liYou can loop. So, if you were to say loopv1 and v1  10, your loop would execute 10 times, but the value in v1 wouldnt change so   the first line in the loop can change value of v1 without changing the   number of times you loop.  li   ol      pYou need to do 3 things.p      ol   liWrite a function that decrements by 1.  li   liWrite a function that subtracts one variable from another.   li   liWrite a function that divides one variable by another.  li   liSee if you can implement all 3 using at most 4 variables. Meaning, youre not making function calls now, youre making macros. And at   most you can have 4 variables. The restriction really only applies to   divide, the other 2 are easy to do with 4 vars or less. Division on   the other hand is dependent on the other 2 functions, so, if subtract   requires 3 variables, then divide only has 1 variable left unchanged   after a call to subtract. Basically, just make your function calls to   decrement and subtract so you pass your vars in by reference, and you   cant declare any new variables in a function, what you pass in is all   it gets.li   ol blockquote  pMy psuedocode solution loopx means loop through this block of code x timesp  precode     returns number  1     int decrementint number              int previous  0         int i  0          loopnumber                      previous  i             i                   return previous            returns number1  number2     int subtractint number1, int number2              loopnumber2                      number1 decrementnumber1                   return number1            returns numeratordenominator     divideint numerator, int denominator              loopsubtractnumerator1, denominator                      return 1  dividesubtractnumerator, denominator, denominator                   return 0      codepre  pHere are C methods that you can build and run.

Negative 1066 pIve just come across a nice STLlike tree container class written by Kasper Peetersp  pa hrefhttptree.phisci.com relnofollowhttptree.phisci.comap  pHowever, because its STLlike, its geared towards having a single class type in the tree i.e. codetemplate ltclass Tgtcode.  The trouble is, like STLlists, if it suffers from the polymorphic class problem, in that the objects in the tree that are pointers to heap based objects like pointers to a base class, arent destroyed when nodes are deleted.p  pSo, my optionsp  p1 Use a tree of boostsharedptr, although this is more expensiveoverkill than Id like.p  p2 Write a little pointer wrapper like the one Ive written below.  The idea being that it wraps a pointer, which when it goes out of scope, deletes its pointer.  Its not ref counted, its just guarantees the pointer destruction.p  precodetemplateltclass Tgt class TWSafeDeletePtr  private     T ptr public     TWSafeDeletePtr  ptrNULL      TWSafeDeletePtrT ptr  ptrptr      TWSafeDeletePtr               delete ptr          T ampoperatorT ptr              assertptr         delete ptr         ptrptr         return ptr          void setT ptr              thisptr           T ampoperator const  return ptr      T operatorgt const  return ptr   codepre  p3 Write my own allocator which allocates the node objects from a pool in the allocate and deletes the pointed to memory in the deallocate.p  p4 Specialise the code to make a tree of pointers, avoiding the initial allocation and copy construction, plus innately knowing how to delete the pointedto data. p  pI already have option 2 working, but Im not really happy with it, because I have to actually insert an empty ptr to begin with, then set the pointer when the insert returns an iterator.  This is because the tree uses copy construction, and hence the temporary object passed on the stack will ultimate delete the pointer when it goes out of scope.  So I set the pointer upon return.  It works, its hidden, but I dont like it.p  pOption 3 is looking like the best candidate, however I thought Id ask if anyone else has already done this, or has any other suggestionsp  pstrongOk, Ived decided to go with option 1 tree of sharedptrs, mainly because its using standard libraries, but also because the extra refcount per node wont break the bank.

Negative 1066 pIm currently working on a reporting library as part of a large project. It contains a collection of logging and system message functions. Im trying to utilize preprocessor macros to strip out a subset of the functions calls that are intended strictly for debugging, and the function definitions and implementations themselves, using conditional compilation and function like macros defined to nothing similar to the way that assert calls are removed if NDEBUG is defined. Im running into a problem. I prefer to fully qualify namespaces, I find it improves readability and I have my reporting functions wrapped in a namespace. Because the colon character cant be part of a macro token I am unable to include the namespace in the stripping of the function calls. If I defined the functions alone to nothing I end up with codeNamespacecode.  Ive considered just using conditional compilation to block the function code for those functions, but I am worried that the compiler might not competently optimize out the empty functions. p  precodenamespace Reporting      const extern stdstring logFileName      void Reportstdstring msg     void Reportstdstring msg, stdstring msgLogAdd     void Logstdstring msg     void Messagestdstring msg      ifdef DEBUG         void DebugLogstdstring message         void DebugMessagestdstring message         void DebugReportstdstring message         void DebugAssertbool test, stdstring message     else         define DebugLogx         define DebugMessagex         define DebugReportx         define DebugAssertx     endif   codepre  pAny idea on how to deal with the namespace qualifiers with the preprocessorbr Thoughts on, problems with, just removing the function codebr Any other ways to accomplish my goalp

Negative 1066 pI work in an engineering lab, not a computer science lab. As such, our inhouse software is not the deliverable product. Instead, the inhouse software is used to analyze engineering problems, and we deliver the results.p  pThis makes version control a living hell. Or perhaps I should just say that the standard trunk and branch version control tree structure doesnt seem to apply. Im hoping someone can suggest a better way of doing things.p  pFor example, each engineering project requires adding case specific input files, runtime files, and postprocessing files. None of these really belong in trunk, because they arent general, but each new project needs these files. We tried putting templates in trunk but there was no clear best practice as to when templates should be merged up.p  pSimilarly, the inhouse code is always evolving as we add new capabilities. Many of these should be merged into trunk so they will be available for future applications. However, there are also quite a few casespecific hacks which the trunk doesnt need to see.p  pHow should we organize this mess Obviously, the simpler the better.p
Negative 1066 pThe Scenario   I have a plain tableView in a popover which constrains its height to four visible rows. When the popover view controller is initialized, the table datasource array may be populated  with, for example, 10 elements.   My user has previously selected one of the 10 element values which persists in a core data object.   When the popover view controller is initialized, I match the userselected core data value with the datasource array value and save the index to the row property of an NSIndexPath viewController property named selectedIndexPath.   Then when the table loads, I checkmark the cell at selectedIndexPath.row and scroll it to UITableViewScrollPositionTop.p  pThe History I never was able to get either tableViewscrollToRowAtIndexPathatScrollPositionanimated or scrollRectToVisibleanimated to accomplish this, either from the viewController viewWillAppear or viewDidLoad methods.

Again, this worked as desired for example, the 10th element in the datasource array would be matched with the core data value, the index saved to selectedIndexPath.row, and the above method called with the tableView and selectedIndexPath row, and the tableView would appear scrolled to contain the checkmarked row.p  pThe Problem With the 4.2 GM release, the desired scrolling does not work anymore  only the four tableView cells are displayed for the first four values in the datasource array. For the example, the cell in the 10th row will still be checkmarked as before, but scrolling that lower row into view will not be achieved.p  pNote that the workaround method previously only worked when called from viewWillAppear and not from viewDidLoad. With the release of 4.2 GM seed, the above workaround no longer works.p  pThis is in an iPad app. I am using the recently released Xcode 3.2.5 and iOS SDK 4.2 GM seed Snow Leopard. I have verified that when I build for both iOS SDK 3.2 Simulator and Device, the above code works. When building for both iOS SDK 4.2 GM Simulator and Device, none of  the above code, tableViewscrollToRowAtIndexPathatScrollPositionanimated, or scrollRectToVisibleanimated, work to achieve scrolling the desired row into view.p  pIs this a bug Any help or thoughts will be appreciated.p

Ive been asked to add sorting, pagination and filtering.  I was able to add some javascript libraries to enable sorting and pagination, and a different library to enable the filtering.  However, since they are separate libraries, they do no cooperate, so when I filter, the table doesnt keep to the constraints of the entries per page field.  p  pI made some attempts at a few jQuery solutions, but couldnt get them to work.  What Im looking for is the best and naturally the easiest solution to adding pagination, column sorting and column filtering without the need to press enter or hit any buttons.  p  pThanks very much in advance and I hope everyone has a happy and healthy new yearp

Negative 1066 pIn my application I have a DataSet that holds tables that are used in different forms, all over my application.

Working in the designtime however causes allot of frustration. For examle I have a form with a DataGridView bound to a BindingSource. If I want to be able to work with the columns of the DataGridView in designtime, I must have an object of my custom DataSet accessible to the BindingSource in the InitializeComponent.p  pAll workarounds for this I can think of are pretty ugly hacks. Like using a dummy object in Designer.cs to keep the designtime happy, and then assign the static object to the field holding the dummy object. And after that reset all the bindings in in the constructor. This must be considered very bad practice, rightp  pstrongSo my question is thisstrong Isnt there a more elegant, or at least practical approach to this Or are there any suggested bestpractices for working with DataSets in multiple formsp  pstrongEditstrongbr Stock refers to stock keeping as in inventory.

Negative 1066 pSuppose you have a property with copy semantics. What should you do in the setter if the copy method fails I presume this is a possibility, since a copy usually starts with an allocinit combo, which can fail and return nil. Apple recommends returning error codes rather than using exceptions, but a setter generally has a void return type. What is the recommended approach How do you signal that an error has occurredp

Negative 1066 pI am trying to write some dynamic code where a user can try calling a method from a specific instance of a class and have it be resolved at runtime. The implementation to retrieve the information exists but the method to access it does not because it is on a per instance basis.p  pFor example, a user may want to call a method named getSomething which doesnt exist in the classp  precode[someInstance getSomething] codepre  pIn this situation, I want to have an implementation resolved which has a variable return type that will only apply to the instance being worked on. I was considering using a hrefhttpdeveloper.apple.comlibrarymacdocumentationCocoaReferenceObjCRuntimeRefReferencereference.htmlapplerefcfuncclassaddMethodclassaddMethoda from the ObjectiveC but I am not 100 sure of its behavior. On the documentation it claims that this can be used to add class or instance methods. Does calling this class add the method to only the specific instance or to the class so that every instance created afterward will have the method on it I also read that once a method is added you cant remove it.p  pPerhaps my approach isnt correct so if any alternatives are known I would appreciate it. I cannot use message forwarding because there is no class that understands the selector already implemented.p

My question is how do I control this global definep  pI currently have a javascript toggle that sets a cookie and then reloads the current page.  And every subsequent page just reads that cookie to set the global define.

And 2, search engines cant view the multiple languages since they dont really use cookies and javascript.p  pSo how do I solve this Does anybody have experience in this Can you share your experiencesp  pIm leaning towards just using the url and dropping the cookie that seems popular among various international sites Ive seen.  So Im guessing the urls would bep  precodedomain.compage       for english, equivalent to domain.comenpage domain.comespage    for spanish domain.comfrpage    for french etc ...... codepre  pIs this a good idea I will have to go through my code and prepend all my hrefs with the language code, which might be a pain.p  pSo does anybody have any comments on this Is this a good plan Am I neglecting to realize somethingp

Negative 1066 pIve been doing my research about exposing Eclipse plugins as web services, but Im getting confused. p  pMy requirement is basically to build an Equinox back end for a set of web services.  Ill be using EMF and related projects heavily, so with this goal in mind Ive been reading about EquinoxOSGI and options to build what I need. p  pHowever, there are some mysterious points and in general an abundance of projects around. Given the findings below, Id like hear your suggestions. Maybe there is an option Im missing, or maybe youve done this before. Here are the nominees drumrollp  pHosting Equinox in a web container. Using bridge.war, the plugins can expose a servlet. The problem is, to use nice REST frameworks such as RestEasy my favourite, the REST framework needs to be a osgi bundle thatd live in the Equionox runtime. Ive spend 3 days, and due to classloader issues, this is not working. I am now convinced that I wont be able to have RestEasy in Equinox. I can have RestEasy in web container, and use XML serializationdeserialization to make code in web container talk to code in Equionox, but this feels like such a waste of resources. Still, this may work. p  pThe other option seems to be ECF, which is an implementation of distributed OSGI, which seems to support SOAPRest. However, I could not find a clear tutorial that just exposes Equinox hosted functionality as a web service. So this still forces me no not to use RestEasy, but at least it seems to give me a proper framework to talk to Equinox. Id probably still have to keep this in a web contaner for scalability. p  pThen there is Eclipse Virgo, which seems to support hosting web applications alongside OSGI runtime, and apparently web container hosted code can talk to OSGI runtime code. Still, I am not sure if I can pass around classes since a Jaxb annotated type A created under web container is likely to use a differnet classloader than the OSGI runtime plugin. Also, this setup locks me into Virgo, and I would rather go with JBoss etc for production use. p  pSo given these options, and possibly more I do not know about at the moment, how would you expose EMF and other Eclipse framework based projects as web servicesp  pEdit  based on the great response Id like to add more. Partially details of the question, partially comments which did not fit into comment section. p  pMy research after the question let me to the exact same point with the accepted answer Apache CXF is now an implementation of Distributed OSGI, which is good. I have given up on RestEasy. My current concern is, I already have a XSD that has created my classes. RestEasy made it very easy to expose these, and Id have to do the same here. My plugins would have to use these JAXB based classes. In the worst case, I may attempt to use Eclipse Link project which offers JAXB support, in order to create XML content, and pass it through either basic servlet use or as string values based on CXF. So solutions discussed here dont feel perfect, but I guess this is the best one can do at the moment.p

Negative 1066 pDo files opened like codefilefoo.txtcode have any info about file modification timep  pBasically I want to know if the file has been modified or replaced since a certain time, but if the file is replaced between checking modification time and opening the file, then you have inaccurate information.p  pHow can I be surep  pThanks.p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  prubayeet Thanks for the answer 1, I actually didnt think of that. But... What to do if the modification time has changed Perhaps I reload the file again. But what if it changes that time If the file is being touched regularly I could end up in a loop forever What I really want is a way to just get an open file handle and a modification time to go with it, without a potential infinite loop.p  pPS The answer you gave was actually plenty good enough for my purposes as the file wont be changed regularly, its general interest on my part now.p  pstrongUPDATE 2strongp  pThinking the previous update through and experimenting a little I realize that simply knowing the file modification time at the point the file was opened is not so much use as if the file is modified while reading you can have some or all of the modified data in the stuff you read in, so youd have to open and readprocess the whole file, then check mtime again as per rubayeets answer to see if you may have stale data.p

Negative 1066 pI recently started learning a hrefhttpwww.zeromq.org0MQa. Earlier today, I ran into a blog, a hrefhttptaotetek.wordpress.com20110202pythonmultiprocessingwithzeromqPython Multiprocessing with ZeroMQa. It talked about a hrefhttpzguide.zeromq.orgpage3aalltoc9the ventilator patterna in the 0MQ Guide that I read about, so I decided to give it a try. p  pInstead of just calculating products of numbers by workers as the original code does, I decided to try to make the ventilator send large arrays to workers via 0mq messages.  The following is the code that I have been using for my emexperimentsem. p  pAs noted in a comment below, any time I attempted to increase the variable strongstringlengthstrong to a number larger than 3MB, the code hangs. p  pTypical symptom lets say we set the strongstringlengthstrong to 4MB i.e. 4194304, then perhaps the result manager gets the result from one worker, and then the code just pauses. htop shows the 2 cores not doing much. Etherape network traffic monitor shows no traffic on the lo interface either.p  pSo far, after hours looking around, I have not been able to figure out whats causing this, and would appreciate a hint or two as to why and any resolution about this issue.

Negative 1066 pIm attempting to build an implementation of Conways Game of Life in a Ruby on Rails webapp to get adjusted to the framework.p  pHowever, Im running into a bit of a problem.p  pThe way that I want the actual game page to work is by creating an html partial that will update the array using the game of lifes algorithm, and draw the points to the canvas element.p  pIve got the code to do this already, and even have the partial built.

Since via iOS5 it has become completely impossible for nonjailbroken iPhones to do so not sure because of new security restrictions, I want to know if the opposite is possible. That is, is there any Access Point available that can record the information of the devices that did a scan, and put it in the syslogp  pOr can you please suggest another way The basic idea is that the iPhone must get a data from another device in this case WiFi, and were also thinking about bluetooth and send it to a server. p  pstrongEDITstrong Ive read that its possible to get the current SSID using CaptiveNetwork.h, can someone provide me information about this Thanks.p

Please let me know if one or more steps are incorrect.p  ol liI have a service reference to my WCF Service in my ASP.NET MVC project.li liI first attempted to just deploy the MVC project using web deploy. The MVC part worked fine, but it couldnt find my service. Although, interestingly enough, I can see the DLLs to my service on my host.li liSo, after messing with this for a bit, I then tried to upload my service separately via SFTP. I was able to hit the .svc file at one point, but lately Ive been receiving errors. Im assuming this is because Ive been trying to figure it out and have screwed it up royally.li liI get a bit confused here because I dont understand what the address should be, or how I should configure it within the WCF App.config file so that my MVC application can access it.li ol  pLike I said, I was good until I had to deploy and, unfortunately, I am unable to find any tutorials that can help me out.p  pWhat am I not understanding is what setup I need to do to be able to access my service via my MVC application through the host server Do I need to provide the service reference in my MVC project as Im doing now Do I have to configure something in the WCF service directly Is it possible just to do web deploy and Stuff Just WorksTMp  pAppreciate your help.p

Negative 1066 pIf there is a process that reads a big file and saves it in its memoryor just a malloced char, and that main process is forked, if the child process only reads from that memoryor the char, according to copyonwrite, the memory where the pointer is saved is not copied, and both parent and child share the same memory until either one of them tries to write on that memory in which case the process makes a copy of the memory and changes that. p  pSo my question is if there is a copyon write implemented, is there a way to know the amount of memory that the child uses that is not shared with the main process In other words how much memory does a child process actually use, if it uses parents memory from some read callsp  ptop, or ps commands will only give the total amount of memory that the child is supposed to have. i.e assuming that data in memory or pointer is copied by the child.p  pIs there a way to get the amount of data that is actually used by CoW semanticsp  pI went through codeproc[pid]smapscode  as suggested by aix and Mat, but all i found was lots of  empty smaps files.

Negative 1066 pI am new to web programming C in Visual Web Developer and my nonC programming skills are a little rusty too.p  pI have created a table where some of the cells prompt for user input and, once the input is given, the input replaces the prompt.

Later the annotated page needs to be made available for others to view it so I need the page to load without the prompts after they have been done for the first time.  To do this I am trying to identify the user so that that person gets the editable page, all of the edits are saved to an xml file, and if another user runs the page the table settings get read back out of the xml file of edits.p  pI am having trouble consistently writing to the xml file.

Negative 1066 pCurrently, we have a long list of various websites throughout our companys intranet. Most are inside a firewall and require an Active Directory account to access. One of our problems, as of late, has been the increase in the number of websites and the addition of a common code library that stores our database access classes, common helper functions, serialization methods, etc. The goal is to use that framework across all websites throughout the company.p  pCurrently, we have upgraded the inhouse data entry application with these changes consistently. It is uptodate. The problem, however, is maintaining all of the other websites. Is there a best practice or way in which I find out versions on each website and upgrade accordingly Can I have a centralized place where I keep these DLLs and sites reference them Whats the best way to go about finding out what versions are on these websites without having to go through each and every single website, find out the version, and upgrade after every changep  pKeep in mind, we run the newest TFS and are a .NET development team.p

Negative 1066 pI am working through the OAuthAuthorizationServer sample provided by a hrefhttpsourceforge.netprojectsdnoafileslatest relnofollowsourceforgea and I noticed the RSAParameters ResourceServerEncryptionPublicKey has the comments that this needs to not be hard coded and a vague description on what that means. However, in regards to actual implementation I am unable to follow.p  pSpecifically In a real app, the authorization server would need to determine which resource server the access token needs to be encoded for based on the authorization request.

Negative 1066 pThe problem is that I have some dynamically created sets of input tags and I also have a function that is meant to trigger any time an input value is changed. p  precodeinput.onchange, function     Does some stuff and logs the event to the console  codepre  pHowever the .onchange is not triggering for any dynamically created inputs, only for items that were present when the page was loaded. Unfortunately this leaves me in a bit of a bind as .on is meant to be the replacement for .live and .delegate all of which are wrappers for .bind p  pHas anyone else had this problem or know of a solutionp

Negative 1066 pI am building a site for someone who wants to have a sound cloud player on his site, but wants it skinned up to look integrated into the site.  For the moment, I am using a script which will create an iframe element within a hidden div which auto plays, and when a new item is selected to play, it clears the div, and replaces it with a new iframe element.p  pThe next phase for the project requires a bit more integration though. I have been searching for javascript sound cloud integration, but all it seems to provide is creating a simple link that will play and pause the track only on the users request with a little bit of javascript to coax it into playing immediately.p  pAre there any other integrations for sound cloud via javascript that would allow for playing, pausing, stopping and getting information about the current play position like from an event, as well as other events like onstart, onstop, onpositionchange, etcp

Negative 1066 pI have been working with a Visual Studio Addin project for a while. The purpose of this addin is to tell me which Store Procedures are used where in my many projects. p  pI achive this by loading all my projects including The Business and DataAccess projects into one solution and then using EnvDTE to traverse the projects of the solution to get the specific codeitems.p  pThis way I can Identify the methods calling the various Stored Procedures, and it works just great.p  pThen to identify which methods are calling the various methods in my DataAccess project, I use reflection to load the Assembly for each project p  precodeforeach EnvDTE.Project proj in this.solution.Projects      assembly  System.Reflection.Assembly.LoadFromGetAssemblyPathproj   private string GetAssemblyPathEnvDTE.Project vsProject      string assemblyPath       string fullPath  vsProject.Properties.ItemFullPath.Value.ToString     string outputPath  vsProject.ConfigurationManager.ActiveConfiguration.Properties.ItemOutputPath.Value.ToString     string outputDir  System.IO.Path.CombinefullPath, outputPath     string outputFileName  vsProject.Properties.ItemOutputFileName.Value.ToString     assemblyPath  System.IO.Path.CombineoutputDir, outputFileName      return assemblyPath  codepre  pThis system works just great for most projects, but now I have ran into a problem, and I cant get around it ....p  pIs it possible to use this sort of reflection assembly loading for a WebSite project.

Negative 1066 pI need to fire off a long running batch type job, and by long we are talking about a job that can take a couple of hours. The ejb that has the logic to run this long running job will communicate to a NoSQL store and load data etc.p  pSo, I am using JMS MDBs to do this asynchronously. However, as each job can potentially take up to an hour or more lets assume 4 hours max, I dont want the onMessage method in the MDB to be waiting for so long. So I was thinking of firing off an asynchronous ejb within the onMessage MDB method so that the MDB can be returned to the pool right after the call to the batch ejb runner.p  pDoes it make sense to combine an asynchrous ejb method call withing an MDB Most samples suggest using 1 or the other to achieve the same thing.p  pIf the ejb to be invoked from the MDB is not asynchrous then the MDB will be waiting for potentially long time. p  pPlease advise.p

Negative 1066 pI have an codeMVC4code application that uses codeOAuthcode to login via facebook. Once logged in the user can then choose a guestlist from their Facebook Friends. This is fine as I am managing to retrieve the facebook Friends and their IDs. p  pNow I want to be able to post to the Friends wall a message from the application. Is this possible at th moment as there seems to have been a lot of changes to what Facebook allows you to do, if a wall post is not possible, can a private message be sentp  pI have no code snippets from this one, just direction would be appreciated.p  pThanksp

Negative 1066 pI have an absolutely positioned layout with three main divs the header, the left options column, and the content column. The designed behavior is to have the header and left option column stay on the page at all times, while the content column is able to freely scroll up and down picture a control panel to the left and title bar at the top.p  pThe problem is window resizing and leftright xaxis overflow within the content div. My desired behavior is to have a minimum width of about 1000 pixels, at which point a horizontal scrollbar shows up within the content column and allows the user to scroll over. This prevents the window from being resized so small to the point where my layout no longer looks as intended.p  pI had attempted to use the minwidth directive within my existing CSS, but to no avail. minwidth DOES achieve the cutoff Im looking for, however, no horizontal scrollbar turns up and I am unable to scroll horizontally.p  pIs there a way to do this using the existing paradigm, or does the style sheet need to be done differently The following is my existing implementation with the minwidth attribute I have been testing for contentcolumnp  precodehtml      overflow hidden    body      margin 0px     padding 0px     background E5E5E5     color 000000     fontfamily Open Sans, sansserif     height 100     maxheight 100     overflow hidden     border 0px none   header      position absolute     margin 0px     top 0px     left 0px     display block     color FFFFFF     background 146647     fontsize 1.5em     padding 5px     width 100     overflow hidden     zindex 3   optioncolumn      position absolute     left 0px     top 40px     bottom 0     background 0F4C35     color FFFFFF     width 155px     padding 3px     zindex 2     overflow auto   contentcolumn      position absolute     overflow auto     minwidth 1000px     zindex 1     top 40px     left 161px     right 0px     bottom 0px     padding 3px     background E5E5E5     color 000000     fontsize 14px      codepre  pAnd this is my HTML structurep  precodeltbodygt     ltdiv idheadergt         Head     ltdivgt      ltdiv idoptioncolumngt         Option Column     ltdivgt      ltdiv idcontentcolumngt         ltdiv classheadertextgtContent Headerltdivgt         ltdiv idsubheadergt             Content contentcolumn intended to stop resizing at 1000px         ltdivgt     ltdivgt  ltbodygt codepre

Negative 1066 pThere are already a handful of questions out there but none seem to have gotten any attention or answers to what is causing this error, and how to fix it. p  pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pI have created an ASP.NET MVC4 application that has a single point of data access in another application I created using the WCF Application project template in VS2012. If I run both applications in debug mode so it is using IIS express at this point for both they can talk to each other just fine. All my calls work, no issues.p  pI wanted to test it in a more realistic environment so I got my IIS set up IIS 8 on a windows 8 box, created a website, and underneath that website I am hosting both these applications, the MVC one, which I am calling Dashboard, and the WCF one which I am calling Service. So it looks something like this in IISp  precode MYMACHINENAME    App Pools  Sites      local         aspnetclient         dashboard application, MVC4         service application, WCF codepre  pI can hit the localhostservice and I see the right information there, so I know it is hosting correctly. p  pI updated the service reference in the MVC4 project to point to localhostservice rather than the iis express one I was using. p  pstrongThe Problemstrongp  pAdding the new service reference to the MVC4 app worked fine, I got the wsdl info and I can see all the endpoint calls I defined. After adding the new service reference, I republished the dashboard application. When I navigation to localhostdashboard, I get an error deep inside the Reference.cs file that the service reference created. Here is the code that is throwing the errorp  precodeMyServiceAPIClient svc  new MyServiceAPIClient svc.Open User userRecord  svc.GetUserRecordadSAMName codepre  pOn that third line it gets into the Reference.cs file that is created when I add the service reference. This line of code it dies on in the Reference.cs file is herep  precodepublic Dashboard.Web.MyApiService.User GetUserRecordstring userName      return base.Channel.GetUserRecorduserName  codepre  pAnd the error message is thisp  precodeAn error occurred while getting provider information from the database.

Negative 1066 pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comrdbF1.jpg altCompose status message UIView in Facebook for iOSp  pIm trying to build a compose status screen for my app and Im looking at Facebook for iOS for inspiration. Above is their compose status screen.p  pI understand that the top is simply the navigation bar, the bottom can be a simple view with buttons in it I will actually just have the camera and location icons. However, I cant quite figure out what UI components make up the fullscreen codeUITextViewcode in the middle. Im trying to replicate it, except without the profile pic on the upper left.p  pWhen you type a status message, it looks like an ordinary codeUITextViewcode. However, when you tag a location, the code at name of locationcode is appended to the codeUITextViewcode and moves with the end of your status as you type along. Now, I dont think thats a codeUITextViewcode feature. Also, the location text is not editable. Even more so, code atcode is not clickable, yet the location itself, in blue in this case, Starbucks Coffee, is.p  pAs for the photo attachment, I can imagine that it is simply a codeUIImageViewcode added via codeaddSubviewcode to the parent view which contains it and whatever makes up the status and location altogether. My question is, exactly what makes them upp  pWhat Ive tried Well I havent really coded anything, but Ive been looking around and checking out Core Text for a possible implementation. However, it doesnt feel like the right tool to use because the status message needs to be editable. As I understand, Core Text is useful only for rendering something like the location tag, but not editing text like the status message itself. p

Negative 1066 pIm working on a program to import data from an IBM iSeries server into an MSSQL 2008 R2 database. Unfortunately, some developer long ago decided to store dates as a decimal type, effectively breaking the CYYMMDD format being used to store the dates.p  pFor example, in that format, August 1st, 1995 would be stored as 0950801. However, whats actually being stored in the database is 95081, which obviously throws an exception if I try to convert it to System.DateTime.p  pIf it were a simple matter of missing a leading 0, I could easily add that to the string before trying to convert it. However, there are several thousands, really of dates that are only 3 or 4 digits, which I really dont know what to make of. For example, theres a date stored as 1128. I dont know what to make of that at all. If I just tack on 3 leading 0s to that and convert it, it produces an obviously incorrect date.p  pSo, does anyone know a reliable way to parse these dates Either directly through through SQL select statements, or doing some manipulation in C Or am I just to assume 3 and 4 digit dates were never entered correctly in the first place, and just discard such datesp

Negative 1066 pWe would like to store a simple web navigation menu in SQL Server 2012. This will be done for multiple clients, which is why we need it stored. The menu items also need to have a sequence, so they can be ordered how the client wants them. I have been reading up on SQL Servers HierarchyId data type, but almost all the tutorials I find are using the example of an employee or corporate hierarchy, with one root node at the top. After doing hours of reading and testing, I am struck with the feeling that emHierarchyId may not the best tool for a simple navigation menu of linksem. Am I off with this feelingp  pThe main thing I have noticed about HierarchyId that worries me is that strongyou can only have one root node with HierarchyId.strong But with a navigation menu, there are obviously multiple toplevel root nodes that can have children. And since root nodes have no order they are just , our clients wouldnt be able to move around their toplevel menu links.p  pSo the obvious choice would be to have a dummy root node and have all toplevel menu links be under that root node. But according     to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6422953listmenuhierarchyusingsqlserverhierarchyidthis SO questiona, marcs and Jeremy make it seem as if its unusual or not according to the normal usage of HierarchyId to     create an artifical berroot node, just to have multiple     firstlevel nodes. And by doing this berroot node, am I not also     throwing off the GetLevel function of SQL server, since the     toplevel nodes will now display as level 1 instead of 0p  pIm considering just going the route of storing a ParentId in each row and using recursion in C to build the menu hierarchy. Would I be wrong in doing that Is the HierarchyId data type really meant for this type of situation, and I am just missing somethingp

Negative 1066 pToday I found a hrefhttpgit.macropus.org201111pdftotextexample relnofollowthis fantastic code examplea on how to extract text from a pdf file using pdf.js. The functionality is perfect, but the script itself has more code than whats really needed to call the pdf.js library and is rather messy. An example of this is having an unneeded ajax call to another page. Due to this reason, I decided to clean up this code so I, and others, can use it in future projects.p  pIve spent all day cleaning up this code and making it work with the html5 file api, but there is one slight issue with my rewrite... p  pFor the life of me I cant figure out how to log the output pdf page text to the browser console after looping over each text layer within a PDF page. The text will add to the page DOM, but its inside a canvas with its original font, which is no good. I want to achieve the same functionality as the existing script  that is adding text to a div so it looks like plaintext. I dont want to have the canvas html, or the original font appended to the text.p  pThe problem lies here in a hrefhttpsgithub.comjjmpsphtml5pdfblobmasterfiledrag.js relnofollowfiledrag.jsap  precodepage.startRenderingcontext, function     if self.complete  total                     window.setTimeoutfunction             var layers  []             var nodes  document.querySelectorAll.textLayer gt div             for var j  0 j lt nodes.length j                 layers.pushnodes[j].textContent  n                          console.logtesting logging             console.loglayers.joinn.replacesg,           , 1000      , textLayer codepre  pAs you can see, I have added a debug line to the code on line 9 abovep  precodeconsole.logtesting logging codepre  pBut if you try run my version of the script and uploading the pdf file supplied, no data will get outputted to the browser console, but the text will be appended to the DOM as a parent of a canvas element. Grrp  pWhy isnt the text being outputted to the browser console I have a feeling this is some sort of threading problem, but Im really not experienced enough with writing Javascript to be able to tell. The original code sends variables through codewindowcode by using an iframe, but I find this really ugly and Id much prefer to use my version of the code as its neater and more flexible to extend.p  pa hrefhttpsgithub.comjjmpsphtml5pdf relnofollowI have posted this project to githuba, as it requires extra dependencies which meant that I couldnt post it up on jsfiddle etc... This is my first time using github, so I hope the repo is accessible for everyone.p  pIf anyone can help me out here, I would really appreciate it. Any fix suggestions would be nice. Im not expecting someone to just go ahead and fix this code for me, Id just love some pointers as to how I can fix this.p  pCheers.p

Negative 1066 pMy employer wants me to use DNS professional edition for his next project as a speech recognition engine. Basically the project has two modules 1.Speech to text 2. Sign language recognition. The project is aimed at university students with hearing disabilities and is programmed in C using .NET framework 4.5. p  pMy problem is that I have searched the internet for days but have found next to nothing on programming using DNS with .NET. I have contacted Naunce as well but didnt get any reply. I know this site in not for such a question but I am getting desperate here.p  pMy question is strongIs there any material on how to use DNS speech recognition engine I would prefer free literature but any material is appreciated, free or otherwise.strongp  pThanks in advance.p  pNote Please take notice that I am not asking for tutorials on using Dragon Naturally Speaking software, I am asking for programming in C using DNS speech recognition engine.p  pstrongSolution 1strongp  pBecause of the lack of documentation on programming DNS with C, I am going to follow my colleagues advise and try out codeChant  SpeechKit 7code for a month.

I know the operations I need to perform, an codeXORcode on the first one, and an codeORcode on the last one, but can I do both in one queryp  pAt first I thought I could use a codeCASEcode like this example belowp  precodeUPDATE products  SET pStatus  CASE pId      WHEN 66 THEN pStatus  1      WHEN 66 THEN pStatus  64  END  WHERE pId IN 66 codepre  pHowever that just runs the first codeXORcode, but not the second codeORcode. p  pI also thought you might be able to just run both functions one after the other, like thisp  precodeUPDATE products  SET pStatus  1  64  WHERE pId  66 codepre  pHowever that just produces a syntax error.p  pemstrongDoes anyone have a solution where I can run both in one queryemstrongp  hr  pstrongEDIT AND SOLUTIONstrongp  pI was close with my query above, combining them together.

Negative 1066 pI am sorry i dont know maven good enough for the complex environment i am currently working in 1k applications, most of them are Java EE. I still give it a try to describe what i want to archivep  p0. There is a company framework that abstracts the Java EE World a bit and is used in all the Java EE componentsp  p1. I checked out the maven project of the Java EE component i am working with      during the build it downloads the dependencys of other components out of the companys  repository and stores it inside my local repo for compilation. So i can see the jarfiles of the companys framework inside my local repo. p  p2. I now want to change some of the frameworks functionality for a local test so i checked out their sources from another SVN repository. I made the changes and build that framework component with maven clean install.p  p3. I rebuild the component i am working with as well. p  pInside eclipse i can now click on one of a frameworks classes method and it opens the according source. But this only happens because the local repo is meant to contain sourcejars for any dependency as well. So in my editor i can see this source is from the jar of the framework in my local repo and i cant change anything. p  pCould someone please give me a hint how i can archive the followingp  ul liI can make changes to the framework and build the frameworks jars with clean install li liI can build my component and it uses the above compiled framework jars rather than the old ones from the local repo. li ul  pI will right now start to read the entire maven documentation and each and every section i try to understand that dependency management since 1 year and still dont get it but i would really appreciate if you could help me out a bit here. p

Negative 1066 pSo I have checked many many sites, researched for days now. And I have not found or come up with one of my own solution for this problem.p  pI know, apparently since Windows Vista, a Windows Service since its created in Session 0 its not able to interact with whats considered GUI executables like console apps and other softwares that are part of other Sessions that are not Session 0.p  pAccording to Microsoft, a Service that does this would be a potential Virus.

In this case cmd.exe.  I have checked many times and I am certain that the process is actually created. But the arguments, the actual commands, that I want that cmd.exe to execute...they are being ignored. They just never happen. I tested the code elsewhere, as a library, as a windows form application it is working like clockwork. But yet, as a Service it wont work.p  pI have tried solutions like enabling to interact with Desktop. Even from Registry Key. I have tried even calling different executables, and it happens the same thing it creates the process, but it doesnt execute the commands or arguments.p  pI have read many have had this problem... however no solution have been found by all these sites that I have seen this problem for.

Regardless, I tried this simple test scriptp  precodeltphp  headerXAccelRedirect httpothersite.comprotectedvideostest.mp4 codepre  pBut I dont know what to use in my nginx config to serve the file at codehttpothersite.comprotectedvideostest.mp4code, while still hiding the original video URL from the user.p  pWhen I access the above test script, nginx returns a code404 Not Foundcode and the error log has an entry like sop  precodeopen varwwwsite.comwebpublichttpothersite.comprotectedvideostest.mp4 failed 2 No such file or directory codepre  pSo, nginx is obviously trying to resolve codehttpothersite.comprotectedvideostest.mp4code to a path in the sites document root, rather than recognising that its a resource at another location and just proxying the file.p  pAnyone got any tips on getting this workingp

Whereas the get2 which builds the second class the one with the map  is noticeably slower  just over 5 seconds.p  pWhy is constructing the class with the map slower than constructing the one with the two vectors  you should see Ive kept the constructors and the two get functions almost identical except for the addition of elements to vectors, or the addition of key value pairs to the map. So it is my suspicion that repeatedly pushing back to a vector is faster and more efficient than adding key value pairs i.e. codemymap[newkey]  newvaluecode repeatedly.p  pHow can I speed up the map versionp  pThanks, Ben. p

Negative 1066 pI am using this js function to export CSV from an Highcharts chart. I am already using the latest version of Highcharts 3.0.7. The CSV is exported correctly, the problem with this code is that AFTER exporting a 3d chart the xaxis, in some cases, is modified as if the Highcharts javascript object had been changed. However, the code below doesnt touch at least this is what I think the real Highcharts object.p  pAfter some tests, I discovered that commenting this ifblockp  precodeif xAxis.categories      columns.pushxAxis.categories     columns[0].unshift  codepre  pprevents the xaxis to be updated after the export, but at the same time this obviously breaks the exported CSV.p  pHow is this possiblep  precodefunction Highcharts        Options     var itemDelimiter  ,   use  for direct import to Excel         lineDelimiter  n      var each  Highcharts.each     Highcharts.Chart.prototype.getCSV  function           var xAxis  this.options.xAxis[0],             columns  [],             line,             csv  ,             row,             col          if xAxis.categories              columns.pushxAxis.categories             columns[0].unshift                   eachthis.series, function v             columns.pushv.yData             columns[columns.length  1].unshiftv.name                    Transform the columns to CSV         for row  0 row lt columns[0].length row              line  []             for col  0 col lt columns.length col                  line.pushcolumns[col][row]                          csv  line.joinitemDelimiter  lineDelimiter                  return csv               Now we want to add Download CSV to the exporting menu.

This behaviour similar to pass by reference happens only with objects and this is what really misleaded me.  JavaScript is really sneaky in this case.p

So multiple exception case statement does not work for me. When an exception is caught, I match it with generic exception, check the exception type with the isOneOf function. Ideally the function will take a sequence of types, instead of a sequence of classes. How do I pass in a sequence of exception types, rather than a sequence of classes and check the caught exception against the sequence of typesp

Negative 1066 pI have three scenes viewControllers linked through modal segues I dont want a navigation controller.  The view has a series of buttons, each initially with a redlight image.  When clicked they go to the next scene, whose action may affect the image on the preceding scene by making it a yellow or green light image.  p  pIf the button image is changed programmatically via setImage, and later if the button is clicked again, the button image always reverts to the initial redlight image.  Similarly if I change the button images on scene 2, go back to scene 1, and then back to scene 2 again, the buttons are back to default, rather than retaining the previous button image state.p  pSo, the two basic questions arep  ol liHow to prevent the button image from changing back to default when clicked. li liHow to have an visited scene remember its previous settings rather than go back to initial settings when visited a second time.li ol  pThanks, Rayp

Negative 1066 pWe have a Solr 4.51 Debian installation that is being filled up by a node.js app. Both reside on the same machine. We are adding about 250 to 350 documents per second.

Negative 1066 pI bumped into OWIN and Katana and I am now trying to understand what this is really about. From what I understand is that it simply tries to separate the web application from the web host.p  pSo it basically says that when you build an ASP.NET MVC web application that your tied to IIS when you deploy the web application. With OWINKatana you dont have that problem. Thats what I understand from it, is this correctp  pIf so, then why would I want to use OWINKatana in my project when I could simply use modmono to deploy my ASP.NET web application to a server like NGINX, Apache etc.p  pBecause thats basically the goal of the OWIN project right But I find it more trouble to implement OWINKatana into my web application then to just simply use the emWeb APIem of MVC and later on deploy it to a Mono environment. I could even run it in Linux if i want.p  pSo when should one choose OWINKatana over Mod Mono Does it really makes a difference in the endp

Negative 1066 pI have a view with a label in it. The lower side of this view is filled with a subview which has its own view controller. This subview has a button. My goal I want to change the label by pressing the button in the subview. p  pI have tried the code beneath. It works fine when I let the ViewWillAppear method of the delegate call the doSomeTask method of the SubviewController. A timer begins to count and after a few seconds, the SubviewController calls the delegates changeLabel method, and the label is changed. However, when I call the doSomeTask method manually by pressing the button, the delegate isnt listening.

Negative 1066 pI am working on a CouchDB based geocoding application using a large national dataset that is supplied relationally. There are some 250 million records split over 9 tables The ER Diagram can be viewed at a hrefhttpbit.ly1dlgZBt relnofollowhttpbit.ly1dlgZBta.  I am quite new to nosql document databases and CouchDB in particular and am considering how to model this.  I have currently loaded the data into a CouchDB database per table with a type field indicating which kind of record it is.  The id attribute is set to be the primary key for table [A] and [C], for everything else it is autogenerated by Couch.  I plan on setting up Lucene with Couch for indexing and full text search.  The X and Y Point coordinates are all stored in table [A] but to find these I will need to search using data in [Table E], [Tables B, C amp D combined] andor [Table I] with the option of filtering results based on data in [Table F].p  pMy original intention was to create a single CouchDB database which would combine all of these tables into a single structure with [Table A] as the root and all related tables nested under this.  I would then build my various search indexes on this and also setup a spatial index using GeoCouch for reverse geocoding.  However I have read articles that suggest view collation as an alternative approach.p  pAn important factor here I guess is reads vs writes.  The plan is that this data will never be updated, only read.  Data is released every quarter at which time the existing DB would be blown away and a new DB created.p  pI would welcome any suggestions for how best to setup and organise this from any experienced Couch or related document database users.p  pMany thanks in advance for any assistance.p

Negative 1066 pIm experiencing a problem with a producerconsumer setup for a local bot competition think a hrefhttpscalatron.github.io relnofollowScalatrona, but with more languages allowed, and using pipes to connect with stdin and stdout. The items are produced fine, and handled correctly by the consumer, however, the consumers task in this setting is to call other pieces of software that might take up too much memory, hence the out of memory error.p  pIve got a Python script i.e. the consumer continuously calling other pieces of code using codesubprocess.callcode. These are all submitted by other people for evaluation, however, sometimes one of these submitted pieces use so much memory, the engine produces an OutOfMemoryError, which causes the entire script to halt.p  pThere are three layers in the used setupp  ul liConsumer Pythonli liGame engine Javali liPlayers bots languages differli ul  pThe consumer calls the game engine using two bots as argumentsbr codesubprocess.call[setsid, sudo, nu, botrunner, optbotsshrunbots.sh, bot1, bot2]code.p  pInside the game engine a loop runs pitting the bots against each other, and afterwards all data is saved in a database so players can review their bots. The idea is, should a bot cause an error, to log the error and hand victory to the opponent.p  pWhat is the correct place to catch this, though Should this be done on the highest i.e. consumer level, or in the game engine itselfp

Negative 1066 pI did a post about this yesterday. With the help of one answer, I learned the good structure for an email newsletter. I applied those on my email newsletter.

Any ideasp  pEdit I tried writing the pdf data to a pdf file and viewed it, and it looked ok. So the bitmap image is being captured ok, its just on the display that it looks like its being scaled somewhat.p  pEdit2 Also tried getting the bitmap like thisp  precodeNSBitmapImageRep bitmap  [scrollView bitmapImageRepForCachingDisplayInRect[scrollView bounds]] [scrollView cacheDisplayInRect[scrollView bounds] toBitmapImageRepbitmap]  NSImage  image  [[NSImage alloc] initWithSize[bitmap size]] [image addRepresentation bitmap] codepre  pSame results  the bitmap looks exactly the same, bad and scaled when displayed.p  pThis leads me to believe that capturing the bitmap data either way works fine, its creating the view and rendering the image that is doing the scaling. How can I make sure that the view and image are shown at the correct size and scalingp  pEdit3 Ok, I started a new blank project and set this up, and it works perfectly  the new imageview is identical to the grabbed bitmap. So I suspect my issue is stemming from some renderingcompositing issue when drawing the bitmap to the view. Investigating further...p  pIt turns out the issue stems from the scrollView that I am rendering from. This has a transparent background Draw Background is off in IB and the text is the scrollView looks good. If I turn Draw Background ON, with a transparent background color, the text is rendered badly, exactly as it is when I capture the image programatically.p  pSo, in my app, even though Draw Background is off, the scrollView image is captured as though Draw Background is on. So I need to understand why the text is rendered badly when Draw Background is on and set to transparent, and hopefully this will lead me towards a solution.p  pAlso tried creating an NSClipview with background drawing turned off and putting the bitmap view into that, but it sill renders the same. I cant find a way to render the transparent image to the screen without horrible artifacting.p
Negative 1066 pIve started using AutoLayout in my apps and Ive searched around and Im still a little confused about dynamic height of UILabels and UITextViews.

Negative 1066 pI tried doing some research on the SmartGWT Showcase and forums, but I could not find the answer.  I also tried a more widespread Google search and couldnt find an answer either. So, I am hoping I can get some help here.p  pI have a enum java class in my shared folderp  precodepublic enum PointInTimeType   FIRSTF, First, STARTS, Start, ENDE, End, LASTL, Last, MINMI, Minimum, MAXMX, Maximum  private String code private String name  private PointInTimeTypeString code, String name      this.code  code     this.name  name    public String getCode      return code   public String getName      return name  codepre  pI know I can just create a DataSourceEnumField and set the valuemap, but these values are hardcoded and the enum java class could add more enums in the future.  I wouldnt want to have to update the ValueMap whenever the enums is updated.p  pSo, knowing that I am going to have a form with a dropdown SelectItem, Id like to set the optionDataSource to a list of values from the enumfield.p  pSo, I guess I am asking how do I setup a DataSource to get this enum data, or be tied to this enum java classp  pThis way, when I create my form and tie it to another datasource, then I can create a SlectItem, and set it up the way I would any other dropdown.   I am just used to using DataSources tied to a list of objects, and not enums.p

Negative 1066 pI have a server application which renders a 30 FPS video stream then encodes and muxes it in realtime into a a hrefhttpsdvcs.w3.orghghtmlmediarawfiletipmediasourcewebmbytestreamformat.html relnofollowWebM Byte Streama.p  pOn the client side, an HTML5 page opens a WebSocket to the server, which starts generating the stream when connection is accepted. After the header is delivered, each subsequent WebSocket frame consists of a single WebM SimpleBlock. A keyframe occurs every 15 frames and when this happens a new Cluster is started.p  pThe client also creates a a hrefhttpsdvcs.w3.orghghtmlmediarawfiletipmediasourcemediasource.html relnofollowMediaSourcea, and on receiving a frame from the WS, appends the content to its active buffer. The codeltvideogtcode starts playback immediately after the first frame is appended.p  pEverything works reasonably well. My only issue is that the network jitter causes the playback position to drift from the actual time after a while. My current solution is to hook into the codeupdateendcode event, check the difference between the codevideo.currentTimecode and the timecode on the incoming Cluster and manually update the codecurrentTimecode if it falls outside an acceptable range. Unfortunately, this causes a noticeable pause and jump in the playback which is rather unpleasant.p  pThe solution also feels a bit odd I know exactly where the latest keyframe is, yet I have to convert it into a whole second as per the W3C spec before I can pass it into codecurrentTimecode, where the browser presumably has to then go around and find the nearest keyframe.p  pMy question is this is there a way to tell the Media Element to always seek to the latest keyframe available, or keep the playback time synchronised with the system clock timep

Negative 1066 pI have a serious issue trying to put my Web Application into production.p  pMy application is coded in VB.Net With Visual Web Developer 2010, and the environment of production is a virtual machine with Microsoft Server 2008 R2, and IIS 7.5, the application is running with Asp.net 4.0. I tried also on my own computer Windows 7, where I installed IIS, and the same bug occurs.p  pTo limit the charge on SQL server, I put into session a list of rights, which is loaded each time the user wants to have access to any page.p  pThe bug occurs exactly when this list contains more than 178 objects. At 178, the session is created and the page is correctly executed  but when I add a 179th element or more and I tried with different elements, so this cant come from the elements themselves, the page just dont execute correctly the code and IIS crash...p  pIt seems that when there is more than 179 elements in this list, IIS just recycle the App, and so, the session is lost...p  pWhen I debug the application with Visual Web Developer, it is running well, without bug. But when I try to put it into production, that bug occurs. So, this seems to be linked with IIS.p  pAnother problem is that when IIS recycle my App, it doesnt create any log file. So I have nothing more precise to give you.p  pI need help to find a solution to this problem. I try for a week, and I found nothing... this is driving me crazy... If someone has any idea or need more information, please tell me, so I can dig deeper... p  pThanks to everyone.p  pstrongEDIT strongp  pI tried something else, I bypassed the sessions, and now, the rights are directly charged from SQL. The problem still occurs. So, it doesnt come from sessions, but SQL. So, I wonder if there is any limit while doing requests on SQL.p  pBut SQL doesnt seems to have any problem with request that return 3000 elements, and when it returns 179 elements with a lot of joins, it just crash... Well, I have no idea what to do or where search for a solution...p  pstrongEDIT2 strong But, like I said, the problem doesnt occurs when I try execute the code from Visual Web developer.

Negative 1066 pI was doing some reading on Java classes, and I came upon static initializers. However, I cant see the point of using them when you can just set default values in the first place. For example,p  precodestatic int a static      a  5   codepre  pversusp  precodestatic int a  5 codepre  pin a class definition. p  pIs there a difference between these two If not, when would you use static initializers versus default valuesp

Negative 1066 pIve tried any number of searches looking for an actual definitiondescription of just what is legal as a Spring form codepathcode and I cannot find anything. i.e. p  pcodeltformselect pathWhat can I put heregtcode.p  pThe closest Ive been able to find is the table on this page a hrefhttpdocs.spring.iospringdocs2.5.xreferencevalidation.html relnofollowhttpdocs.spring.iospringdocs2.5.xreferencevalidation.htmlap  pTable 5.1 gives examples, but they are only examples.p  pI really am looking for a definitive explanation of exactly what is legal in a Spring codepathcode and also whether any of those are limited to certain versions. I realize this is edging close to asking for favorite offsite resources but Im looking for the information or links to the emofficialem documentation that covers this, not random tutorials, so it should be on topic. I can find plenty of tutorials online but Im looking for complete reference not a basic introduction.p  pIm working on a project using codespringcore2.5.3.jarcode, Id really like to find out what is possible in that version although having reference material for more current Spring versions would be good too. I dont know how possible it will be to get an upgrade of Spring done on this project unfortunately.p  pTo be clear  Im aware that you can access the property codeString getFoocode using the path codefoocode. That in some versions of Spring which you can access the first element of codeString[] getBarcode using codebar[0]code, etc.p  pBut what are the limitations on this, are there any other things you can do p  pDoes it support maps and sets p  pIf its a complex thing like codeMapltString,List[Integer]gt oofcode can you do codeoof[test][3]code as the path. p  pBasically the path supports a lot more than just the simple property reading but I cant find anything telling me just what the options and limitations are. Rather than just trying things and seeing what works and hoping I think of everything Id really like to have a comprehensive list of some kind showing me just what my options are.p

Negative 1066 pI have a https web service I want to consume.p  pIn C I can achieve this in about 10ish lines of code.p  pIn Delphi XE5 Its a major headache and a mess of certificate stores and encryption. I need to be able to consume this in Delphi XE5.p  pMy idea was to stick the simple call to the web service in a C Class Library and then instantiate it via Delphi using codeCreateOleObjectcode. The class library is coderegasm library.dll codebasecode and codegacutil i library.dllcodep  pMy problem seems to be that when consuming a web service from C, it relies quite heavily on the endpoint and binding settings stored in the app.config file. Problem is, is because Im using Delphi and COM this config file reading goes awry I get the error codeCould not find endpoint element with name...code .p  pIve tried various permutations of codeMyDelphiTestApp.exe.configcode and codelibrary.dll.configcode and they all seem to fail getting read copy of the codeapp.configcode file from the class library project that has the correct data in it.

Negative 1066 pI have several files nearly 1GB each with data. Data is a string line. p  pI need to process each of these files with several hundreds of consumers. Each of these consumers does some processing that differs from others. Consumers do not write anywhere concurrently. They only need input string. After processing they update their local buffers. Consumers can easily be executed in parallel.p  pImportant With one specific file each consumer has to process all lines without skipping in correct order as they appear in file. The order of processing different files doesnt matter.p  pProcessing of a single line by one consumer is comparably fast. I expect less than 50 microseconds on Corei5.p  pSo now Im looking for the good approach to this problem. This is going to be be a part of a .NET project, so please lets stick with .NET only C is preferable.p  pI know about TPL and DataFlow. I guess that the most relevant would be codeBroadcastBlockcode. But i think that the problem here is that with each line Ill have to wait for all consumers to finish in order to post the new one. I guess that it would be not very efficient.p  pI think that ideally situation would be something like thisp  ol liOne thread reads from file and writes to the buffer. li liEach consumer, when it is ready, reads the line from the buffer concurrently and processes it.li liThe entry from the buffer shouldnt be deleted as one consumer reads it. It can be deleted only when all consumers have processed it.li liTPL schedules consumer threads itself.li liIf one consumer outperforms the others, it shouldnt wait and can read more recent entries from the buffer.li ol  pAm i right with this kind of approach Whether yes or not, how can i implement the good solutionp

Negative 1066 pSo Ive been dabbling with iOS app development with Cordova PhoneGap for about a year, because Id had experience with JavaScript and web app development in the past, and ObjectiveC always looked absolutely horrible to code in. Now iOS 8 is out, with Swift, so Ive decided to start getting into native development seeing as Swift is a language that seems a lot more intuitive and comparable to languages I already know.p  pIve read plenty of Apples tutorials on app development and I understand the highlevel structure of an iOS app. Its based off of the MVC modelviewcontroller paradigm, where views are elements displayed on the screen, and are arranged in view hierarchies, each of which is controlled by a view controller, and you can transition between view controllers using segues. I understand all that. What Im struggling with is the actual implementation in XCode. p  pMy goal is to take the interface Ive already built in HTML5CSSJS and replicate it using pure iOS technologies. Ive created a project with a storyboard and started placing views into a view controller. There are some customization options, but for the most part I havent really been able to toy around with making custom views, like buttons or text fields. For example, it is an iOS custom since 7 to have buttons essentially be composed of text with no background, like a link in a website. I am part of the party of people that does not like this custom. When I placed a button on the screen, I was looking for options on how to really customize how the button looked, mainly by adding a background to make it actually look like a button, but I found nothing. I would understand having to write custom code to draw, say, a rounded rectangle in the background of the button, but so far everything has just been happening in the storyboard. I was under the assumption that every viewcontroller I placed on the screen would generate an associated source file that I could go edit. But I cant seem to find how to do that either.p  pAs it usually is when I start something new, I am probably missing some fundamental understanding of how things work in XCode. I would like to know how to create custom views as subclasses of existing views and use them in a storyboard, and define exactly how I want them to look and behave. I also want to know how to generate an associated source file from the interface builder. If anyone can point me to a guide or provide me with some information about this, that would be awesome.p

Thank you.p  precodeltDOCTYPE html PUBLIC W3CDTD XHTML 1.0 TransitionalEN httpwww.w3.orgTRxhtml1DTDxhtml1transitional.dtdgt lthtml xmlnshttpwww.w3.org1999xhtmlgt ltheadgt ltmeta httpequivContentType contenttexthtml charsetiso88591gt lttitlegtBasic Pagelttitlegt  ltscript typetextjavascript srcJSjquery1.10.2.jsgtltscriptgt ltscript typetextjavascript srcJSjqueryui1.10.4.custom.jsgtltscriptgt ltscript typetextjavascript srcJSjqueryui1.10.4.custom.min.jsgtltscriptgt ltscript typetextjavascript srcJStinymcetinymce.min.jsgtltscriptgt  ltlink relstylesheet typetextcss hrefcssintranetthemejqueryui1.10.4.custom.cssgt  ltscript typetextjavascriptgt function itemloaderx      req  .ajax         type GET,         url x,         datatype html,         success functiondata             itemtable.htmldata                ltscriptgt  ltscriptgt function     wrapper.dialog         autoOpenfalse,         width780,         height800,         title Item Preview           opener.clickfunction          wrapper.dialogopen       ltscriptgt  ltheadgt ltbody bgcolorFFFFFFgt  ltformgt         ltselect nameperiodselect iditemdropdown onChangejavascriptitemloaderthis.valuegt         ltoption valueItemAJAX.phpModelID0gt Choose Modelltoptiongt         ltoption valueItemAJAX.phpModelID404gtAEROCOOL 100ltoptiongt         ltselectgt ltformgt  ltdiv iditemtable aligncentergt lt Start of AJAX Dynamic Content gt  ltform methodPOST enctypemultipartformdata action namemodelitemgt ltinput nameStartSpecial typehidden value20140601gt ltinput nameModelID typehidden valuemodelidgt  lttable border1 width800gt lttrgt lttd colspan3 aligncentergt  [Form displaying item details for editing]  lttdgt lttrgt lttrgt lttd aligncenter colspan2gt ltinput typesubmit nameUpdateModel valueSave Model Infogt ltinput typesubmit nameUpdateListing valueUpdate Listinggt ltinput typesubmit nameDelete valueRemove Itemgt ltbutton typebutton idopenergtPreviewltbuttongt ltdiv idwrapper aligncentergt lt Start of Hidden diolog Content gt  [Hidden Preview Content]  lt End of Hidden dialog Content gt ltdivgt lttdgt lttrgt  lttablegt ltformgt lt End of AJAX Content gt ltdivgt  ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre

Negative 1066 pI thought that a emsingle resourceem can be identified by emmany URLsem.p  pa hrefhttpsgroups.google.comforummsghaldiscussoIARnoKInpM5FE40uIJAOAJ relnofollowFromap  blockquote   pA resource in a hypermedia API is probably better thought of   representing the API response rather than the underlying model   instance, as the response is obviously not the same from these two   URLsp blockquote  pBut above quote suggests that in REST each URL always identifies a emdifferent resourceem  thus two URLs can never identify the emsame resourceem . Reason being that a emresourceem in a hypermedia API is better thought of as representing the emAPI responseem rather than the emunderlying model instanceem, and considering that emAPI responsesem from different URLs are definitely not identical, the conclusion is that two URLs can never identify the same emresourceem.p  pWould you agree that in REST a emresourceem should be thought of as representing the emAPI responseem and as such two URLs can never identify the same emresourceemp  pThank youp

While the exception is the same, in this case both server and client are run in the same physical machine, and it still doesnt work. Moreover, instructions of how that question was resolved are not yet clear to me. Any assistance is deeply appreciated.p  pEDIT2 I emdoem have the remote interface in its own project, and both the client project and the server project are linked to that project. They have always been.p  pTherefore, both the client and the server have always had the exact same reference to the interface. User AminSaghi stated in the other question that he had solved the problem by using equal references to the interface in both his client and his server which this project of mine has always had.

Negative 1066 pI was having an issue where merge conflicts resulted in the entire file being a conflict.

This file is committed into the repository and overrides an   individuals core.autocrlf setting, ensuring consistent behavior for   all users, regardless of their Git settings. The advantage of a   .gitattributes file is that your line configurations are associated   with your repositoryp blockquote  pThis makes it clear that .gitattributes is capable of overriding autocrlf, but there are no settings in it that tell it to do any eol conversion. Maybe there is some default that is implicitly used.p

Negative 1066 pThis is more of an idea than a problem, so I hope I can write a clear question.p  pIm working on a web application that will produce several data from its day to day operativity, the nature of which isnt important here.p  pThe application will have to show these data to the administrators, so an analytics section or something like that will be needed, and in fact it wouldnt be too hard to put together something usable.p  pBut, before jumping in on developing that section, a thought arised I could instead have a separate application, that queries the webapp for its data and does the data analysis.br In this way the analytics application is separate from the main webapp and could be attached to other web applications.p  pA couple of examplesp  ul lifrom an ecommerce application, the administrators can check the top 10 most sold products or the average income per weekli lifrom a library application, the administrators can check the books that still havent been returned or the number of subscribers per month this year.li ul  pData queries can be vary, and hard coding them in the analytics application is fine. The point is if theres any standard or common way to make the datasets available so that another application can query them.p  pDo you know of any standards or protocols or anything that can guide me in this effort Is this even feasible, or should each application have its own data analysis part because each set of data is differentp

Negative 1066 pSorry this is so long, I tried to condense it.p  pI am using jquery to cycle through several elements and add click triggers to each of their parents. When the parent is clicked, the child element is made visible and moved outside the parent. p  pIn this way, I have created a bottom fixed toolbar where the parent is a button and the child is the panel that is displayed or hidden when the button is clicked. Everything works great, except I cant figure out how to make it so when the user clicks outside the revealed panel, the panel toggles away.p  pHere is some sample markupp  precodeltdiv classdashbargt    ltdiv classdashbuttongt       Button One        ltdiv classdashpanelgt           This is the panel that is toggled when button one is clicked       ltdivgt     ltdivgt      lt Any number of other buttons gt ltdivgt codepre  pAgain, when any dashbutton is clicked it moves the child dashpanel outside its parent, and makes it visible along with some other style trickery.p  pI have several types of panels menus, modals, panels, etc all stored in an object. The jQuery I use to cycle through the elements and add the click triggers isp  precode.each[panel, menu, etc], function index, value       Select all the elements that match this panel type     var panelClass  .dash  value     var panels  panelClass       Now cycle through those elements     panels.eachfunction             Select the panel to be displayed and its parent         var panel  this         var parent  panel.parent           Add the click event to the parent         parent.clickfunction                Toggle the panel with dashbar.panels.togglepanel elsewhere in my object                codepre  pAll that works splendidly. I have tried addingp  precode body.oneclick, function        conceal the panel with dashbar.panels.concealpanel   parent.clickfunctione       e.stopPropagation   panel.clickfunctione       e.stopPropagation  codepre  poutside parent.click, but then the event runs an absurd amount of times and is buggy.p  pWhat I really want is to add the event WHEN the parent is clicked, and remove it after it hides the menu. But, when I add the above INSIDE parent.click I have to click the parent twice the first time in order to reveal the panel. I can only assume that the body.click action is taking effect the first time and hiding the panel.p  pIm stumped and would love to know anything that will get my desired result. Happy to rewrite my code. p  pThanksp

Negative 1066 pHibrI am a bit confused about how to use the leave one out strongLOOstrong method for calculating accuracy in the case of a multiclass, one vs rest classification. I am working on the YUPENN Dynamic Scene Recognition dataset which contains 14 categories with 30 videos in each category a total of 420 videos. Lets name the 14 classes as A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,N.br I am using linear SVM for one vs rest classification. Lets say I want to find the accuracy result for class A. When I perform A vs rest, I need to exclude one video while training and test the model on the video I excluded. This video that I exclude, should it be from class A or should it be from all the classes.br In other words, for finding the accuracy of class A, should I perform strongSVMstrong with strongLOOstrong 30 timesleaving each video from class A exactly once or should I perform it 420 timesleaving videos from all the classes exactly once.brbr I have a feeling that I got this all mixed up  Can anyone provide me a short schematic of the right way to perform multiclass classification using strongLOOstrong br Also how do I perform this using stronglibsvmstrong on Matlab p  pp  pHi EMS, thanks for the detailed reply.brBut the issue is that, the no of videos in the dataset is small, and thus I cant afford to create a separate TEST set which was supposed to be sent to Neptune. Instead I have to ensure that I make full utilization of the dataset, because each video provides some newunique information. In scenarios like this I have read that people use LOO as a measure of accuracywhen we cant afford an isolated TEST set. They call it as the strongLeaveOneVideoOutexperimentstrong. brThe people who have worked on Dynamic Scene Recognition have used this methodology for testing accuracy. In order to compare the accuracy of my method against their method, I need to use the same evaluation process. But they have just mentioned that they are using LOVO for accuracy. Not much detail apart from that is provided. I am a newbie in this field and thus it is a bit confusing.brp  pAccording to what I can think of, LOVO can be done in two wayp  p1 leave one video out of 420 videos. Train 14 onevsrest classifiers using 419 videos as the training set.A vs rest, B vs rest, ........N vs rest. Evaluate the left out video using the 14 classifiers. Label it with the class which gives maximum confidence score. Thus one video is classified. We follow the same procedure for labelling all the 420 videos. Using these 420 labels we can find the confusion matrix, find out the false positivesnegatives, precision,recall, etc.  br 2 From each of the 14 classes I leave one video. Which means I choose 406 videos for training and 14 for testing. Using the 406 videos I find out the 14 onevsrest classifiers. I evaluate each of the 14 videos in the test set and give them labels based on maximum confidence score. In the next round I again leave out 14 videos, one from each class. But this time the set of 14 is such that, none of them were left out in the previous round. I again train and evaluate the 14 videos and find out labels. In this way, I carry on this process 30 times, with a nonrepeating set of 14 videos each time. In the end all 420 videos are labelled. In this case as well I found find confusion matrix, accuracy, precision,recall,etc. brbr Apart from these two methods, LOVO could be done in many other different style. In the papers on Dynamic Scene Recognition they have not mentioned how they are performing the LOVO. Is it safe to assume that they are using the 1st method  Is there any way of deciding which method would be better Would there be significant difference in the accuracies obtained by the two methods p  pbrbr Following are some of the recent papers on Dynamic Scene Recognition for reference purpose. In the evaluation section they have mentioned about LOVO. 1a hrefhttpwww.cse.yorku.cavisionpublicationsFeichtenhoferPinzWildesCVPR2014.pdf relnofollowhttpwww.cse.yorku.cavisionpublicationsFeichtenhoferPinzWildesCVPR2014.pdfa 2a hrefhttpwww.cse.yorku.cawildeswildesBMVC2013b.pdf relnofollowhttpwww.cse.yorku.cawildeswildesBMVC2013b.pdfa 3a hrefhttpwww.seas.upenn.eduderpanisderpanisleccedaniilidiswildesCVPR2012.pdf relnofollowhttpwww.seas.upenn.eduderpanisderpanisleccedaniilidiswildesCVPR2012.pdfa 4a hrefhttpwebia.lip6.frthomenpapersTheriaultCVPR2013.pdf relnofollowhttpwebia.lip6.frthomenpapersTheriaultCVPR2013.pdfa 5a hrefhttpwww.umiacs.umd.edunshroffDynScene.pdf relnofollowhttpwww.umiacs.umd.edunshroffDynScene.pdfap

Negative 1066 pWe have a legacy website from which the powersthatbe have decided we need to remove all of our Google maps, replacing them with maps provided by MapBox. So Im in the middle of a crash project to swap out the old for the new.p  pAnd heres my problem the old site is written in ASP.NET, making heavy use of Teleriks controls. In this page we have a RadSplitter, and a Google map being drawn in a RadPane.p  pSwapping out the Google map with the MapBox map was simple enough, except that the MapBox map isnt rendering correctly. Only the tiles along the left edge of the pane are drawing. But  when I resize the browser window, the rest of the tiles draw.p  pThe div is defined with position absolute, and top, bottom, right, and left set to 0. Which Google maps worked with.p  pMy guess is that Telerik is doing something that is confusing the MapBox rendering code about the actual size of the div. And that when the window resizes, MapBox reevaluates things, and gets it right.p  pIve been playing around with this for a couple of hours now, and getting nowhere p  ul liIve tried triggering a resize event in code, and the tiles didnt draw.li liIve tried placing the map in a fixedsize div, inside the pane, and the map drew to the edges, and then the div sat inside the pane with scrollbars, which confirms, to me, that Im dealing with a sizing issue, but I cant have the scrollbars, so li liIve tried setting the width and height of the div to the size of the pane, in code, and that didnt trigger the map to draw the missing panes.li ul  pIm running out of ideas.p  pIs there some event or function on the MapBox renderer that will cause it to redraw the way it does when the browser resizesp

Negative 1066 pThere are a few other Questions on how to convert Enums and what happens if the value parsed is outofrange, like inp    pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecodepublic enum SomeTypes      SomeType1  1,     SomeType2  2,     SomeType3  3   public class SomeClass      ...     var inRange  SomeTypes 1     var outOfRange  SomeTypes 5     ...  codepre  pGoing outofrange will not produce any error.

For example, I was getting something like p  blockquote   perror parsing the message or timeout exceededp blockquote  pwhich kept me looking for other reasons than the enum outofrange.p  pSuggestions to handle this are by the means of the codeEnum.IsDefinedcode.

Negative 1066 pI am trying to write a HTML page that asks users a series of questions. The answers to these questions are evaluated by my JavaScript code and used to determine which additional JavaScript file the user needs to access. My code then adds the additional JavaScript file to the head tag of my HTML page.  I dont want to merge the code into a single JavaScript file because these additional files are large enough to be a nightmare if theyre together, and I dont want to add them all to the head when the page first loads because I will have too many variable conflicts. Im reluctant to redirect to a new webpage for each dictionary because this will make a lot of redundant coding.

Negative 1066 pI am using Xamarin and C but I suspect the problem is equally valid in a Java environment.p  pI have an ActionBar Activity that hosts three tabs each of which hosts a fragment. It uses a ViewPager to allow the user to swipe between the tabs.p  pThe requirement is to programmatically screenshot each tab and then email these as attachments.p  pThe problem is that whilst the ActionBarViewPager works well it also optimises the tabs  effectively it isnt creating a fragments view until it is next in line to be shown. So, if youre on tab 0  the first tab  then the fragment view for tab 2 is null. So it cant be screenshot.p  pTo overcome this I have tried to set any tabfragment that has a null view to be selected. This generates the view but because setting it to be selected does not actually render it on screen the view does not have a width or a height value so again it cannot be screenshot this is the reason for the defensive check at the start of the code taking the screenshot.     p  pSo, I guess my question is how can I force the tab to be rendered on screen so that it is correctly filled out and can be screenshotp  pMy main code extracts are as followsp  precode    private void EmailReport              List ltBitmapgt bitmaps  new ListltBitmapgt         List ltstringgt summaryFiles  new Listltstringgt           remember the tab were on         var selectedTab  this.ActionBar.SelectedNavigationIndex           take the screenshots         for int fragmentNumber  0 fragmentNumber lt projectFragmentPagerAdapter.Count fragmentNumber                       Android.Support.V4.App.Fragment fragment  projectFragmentPagerAdapter.GetItemfragmentNumber             if fragment.View  null                              this.ActionBar.GetTabAtfragmentNumber.Select                 fragment  projectFragmentPagerAdapter.GetItemfragmentNumber                           bitmaps.AddScreenShotfragment.View                    set the active tab back         this.ActionBar.GetTabAtselectedTab.Select          write the screenshots into  file          int i  0         foreachBitmap bitmap in bitmaps                      if bitmap  null                 summaryFiles.AddBitmapToFilebitmap, this.ActionBar.GetTabAti.Text             i                    now send the file         EmailSupport.SendAttachmentsthis, summaryFiles           private Bitmap ScreenShotView fragmentRootView              if fragmentRootView  null  fragmentRootView.Width  0  fragmentRootView.Height  0             return null          fragmentRootView.DrawingCacheEnabled  true          create a bitmap for the layout and then draw the view into it         Bitmap bitmap  Bitmap.CreateBitmapfragmentRootView.Width, fragmentRootView.Height,Bitmap.Config.Argb8888         Canvas canvas  new Canvasbitmap          Get the views background         Drawable bgDrawable  fragmentRootView.Background         if bgDrawablenull    has background drawable, then draw it on the canvas             bgDrawable.Drawcanvas         else                     does not have background drawable, then draw white background on the canvas             canvas.DrawColorColor.White           draw the view on the canvas         fragmentRootView.Drawcanvas         fragmentRootView.DrawingCacheEnabled  false          return bitmap      codepre  pAny help would be gratefully received. p

Negative 1066 pIm trying to automate test environment creation process. I use Jenkins as my CI server and want to be able to spawn new VM instances based on predefined template on the AmazonEC2. I know that there is a plugin for it if you want to use VM as jenkins build slaves. But I want to use VM as readytouse test environments where build artifacts will be deployed. So the question is what will be the best approach Im currently thinking of using Chef to configure fresh VM instances, but how to spawn the VM itself is a mystery. Any help appreciated. Thanks.p

Once a full millisecond is reached for a particular front end server, we send all the batched up requests around 100 to the back end server using an existing single socket connection.p  pThis means that our back end servers gets requests containing a hundred original HTTP requests and answers with a response containing a hundred requests.p  pIs there a standard protocol to multiplexbatchaggregate HTTP requests The multiplexing in HTTP2 seams to be focused on multiple responses to a single request.p

Negative 1066 pI am tailoring my php website to connect to my java server by creating a socket connection every single web request. Within each request, I am sending about six to ten total Strings back and forth.

Imagine I had 500 users, all click ten times in ten seconds total... thats 500  10  8 40,000 Strings being sent or received in 10 seconds.p  pIf I proceed with this method, is it possible to run into issues down the road I am not factoring in hardware, strictly numbers here. p  pA possible solution, if this is a problem, is to take those 35 Strings, and send them as one.

Negative 1066 pI have a basic question. Ive been reading through some tutorials about spring and hibernate integration and in most of them there are DAO and Service layers like belowp  precode  public interface TeamDAO     public void addTeamTeam team    public void updateTeamTeam team   public Team getTeamint id    public void deleteTeamint id   public ListltTeamgt getTeams    codepre  pThen the implementation of the DAO is provided using the codeSessionFactorycode. For examplep  precode Repository  public class TeamDAOImpl implements TeamDAO          Autowired         private SessionFactory sessionFactory         Implementation follows..   codepre  pAnd then theres another service interface the same as the DAO interface like belowp  precodepublic interface TeamService    public void addTeamTeam team public void updateTeamTeam team public Team getTeamint id public void deleteTeamint id public ListltTeamgt getTeams    codepre  pAnd the service implementationp  precode Service  Transactional  public class TeamServiceImpl implements TeamService     HERE IS MY QUESTION    Autowired    private TeamDAO teamDAO     implementation follows  codepre  pIn the service implementation above where I marked here is my question I see that we inject only the interface codeTeamDAOcode which doesnt have the implementation of the codeTeamDAOImplcode class. So how does the interface and its implementations get injected together in the service layer provided we only inject the interface codeTeamDAOcode and not codeTeamDAOImplcodep

Negative 1066 pOk I got a couple of practice exercises from class and I found one that I couldnt figure out, even though it sounds pretty simple. I have this tables. I want to make a trigger that after every time I update or insert a value into the product table, it updates the class table with the count of how many products belong to that class, and the sum of the prices. p  pAt first I tried using FOR EACH ROW, but I couldnt figure out how to make it so that it reads the product table new product values for the class of the new entry without mutating, as I was trying to read the product table that was being updatesinserted into. Couldnt figure out even if there was a right way to set up new. and old. for this purpose. p  pTried cursors that checked the product table and selects into variables for count and sum, but it was the same problem, the whole mutating problem.p  pNow I got it without the FOR EACH ROW but it Counts and Sums all the products and prices for all classes. I cant figure out how to make it work for each class individually. I though maybe a loop and a counter that increased based on the max class, but that seems overcomplicated.  Any help would be appreciated.p  precodedrop table class        cascade constraints drop table provider     cascade constraints drop table product      cascade constraints   CREATE TABLE class class           number5       constraint  pkclass primary key, description     varchar220    constraint  nn1class CHECKdescription  INITCAPdescription AND description IS NOT NULL, totproduct     number5       constraint  nn2class CHECK totproduct gt0  AND totproduct IS NOT NULL, totprice       number12,2    constraint  nn3class CHECK totprice gt0  AND totprice IS NOT NULL, constraint      pk1class       CHECK class gt0    INSERT INTO class VALUES1,Description 1, 0, 0 INSERT INTO class VALUES2,Description 2, 0, 0 INSERT INTO class VALUES3,Description 3, 0, 0 INSERT INTO class VALUES4,Description 4, 0, 0 INSERT INTO class VALUES5,Description 5, 0, 0   CREATE TABLE provider provider    number5       constraint  pkprovider primary key, description varchar220    constraint  nn1provider    CHECKdescription  INITCAPdescription AND description IS NOT NULL, constraint  pk1provider    CHECK provider gt0   INSERT INTO provider VALUES1,Description 1 INSERT INTO provider VALUES2,Description 2 INSERT INTO provider VALUES3,Description 3 INSERT INTO provider VALUES4,Description 4 INSERT INTO provider VALUES5,Description 5   CREATE TABLE product product         number5       constraint  pkproduct      primary key, description     varchar220    constraint  nn1product CHECK description  INITCAPdescription AND description IS NOT NULL, price           number12,2    constraint  nn2product CHECK price gt0        AND price   IS NOT NULL, available       number5       constraint  nn3product CHECK available gt0    AND available IS NOT NULL, class           number5       constraint  fk1product     references class        NOT NULL,            provider        number5       constraint  fk2product references provider NOT NULL,    constraint      pk1product CHECK product gt0      CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER totclass AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE ON product  DECLARE etotproduct   number5   etotprice     number12,2  BEGIN  SELECT COUNTproduct INTO etotproduct     FROM product     WHERE class  class   SELECT SUMprice INTO etotprice      FROM product     WHERE class  class   UPDATE class SET totproduct  etotproduct, totprice etotprice WHERE class  class END    INSERT INTO product VALUES1,Description 1, 100, 10, 1, 1 INSERT INTO product VALUES2,Description 2, 100, 10, 1, 2 INSERT INTO product VALUES3,Description 3, 100, 10, 2, 1 INSERT INTO product VALUES4,Description 4, 100, 10, 4, 5 INSERT INTO product VALUES5,Description 5, 100, 10, 2, 3 codepre

I have an codeActivity Acode that calls codeActivity Bcode in its codeonCreatecode method codeActivity Bcode has a custom grid view inside a relative layout.p  pWhen in codeActivity Bcode, if the screen orientation remains unchanged and back button is pressed, as expected it goes to codeActivity Acodes codeonResumecode method. However, on changing screen orientation while in codeActivity Bcode, on later pressing back button, it goes to codeActivity Acodes codeonCreatecode method thereby recreating codeActivity Bcode as codeActivity Acode calls codeBcode in its codeonCreatecode. Only on pressing the back button twice does it go back to codeActivity Acodes codeonResumecode method. How do I ensure that on changing orientation, I go to codeActivity Acodes codeonResumecode by pressing back button just oncep  pIve tried includingp  precodeandroidconfigChangeskeyboardHiddenscreenSizeorientation codepre  pin codeActivity Bcode in manifest and hence this avoids calling codeActivity Bcodes codeonCreatecode on changing orientation but it still doesnt solve my problem.p

Negative 1066 pI am trying to implement an application that uses images to search for similar images in a large image database.

Negative 1066 pI have a website and I collect alot of logs on user behavior. What time they log in, what products they look at, how often they look at it,etc.. I want to see if I can do cluster analysis based on this but Im not sure how to incorporate the multiple variables.p  pSpecifically my problem is with how to weight their importance and cluster different groups when different variables are more important to different groups. For example, I understand those who look at the same products can be grouped but theres also a percentage of users who log in to purchase the products because of their job and they tend to log in at the same time every week or month so for them I think consistency of purchasing time would be important.p  pIm weak at stats but Im determined to learn but can anyone point me to a resource where I can learn how to approach this problem I have been looking at kmean, and neural networks but havent had a clear idea of how to implement it to this problem.

Negative 1066 pIm pretty new to python I mainly write code in Java. I have a python script thats essentially a crawler. It calls phantomjs, which loads up the page, returns its source, and a list of urls that it found in the page.p  pIve been trying to use Python 3s codemultiprocessingcode module to do this, but I cant figure out how to use a shared queue that workers can also add to. I keep getting unpredictable results.p  pMy previous approach used a global list of URLs, out of which I extracted a chunk and sent to workers using codemapasynccode. At the end, I would gather all the returned URLs and append them to the global list. The problem is that each chunk takes as long as the slowest worker. Im trying to modify it so that whenever worker is done, it can pick up the next URL. However, I dont think Im doing it correctly. Heres what I have so farp  precodedef workerurl, urls     printmultiprocessing.currentprocess.name  .  strmultiprocessing.currentprocess.pid   loading   url     returnedurls  phantomjsurl     printmultiprocessing.currentprocess.name  .  strmultiprocessing.currentprocess.pid   returning   strlenreturnedurls   URLs      for returnedurl in returnedurls         urls.putreturnedurl, blockTrue      printThere are   strurls.qsize   URLs in total.n  if name  main         manager  multiprocessing.Manager     urls  manager.Queue     urls.appendltsomeurlgt      pool  Pool     while True         url  urls.getblockTrue         pool.applyasyncworker, url, urls      pool.close     pool.join codepre  pIf there is a better way to do this, please let me know. Im crawling a known site, and the eventual terminating condition is when there are no URLs to process. But right now it looks like I will just keep running for ever. Im not sure if I would use codequeue.emptycode because it does say that its not reliable.p

Negative 1066 pI am trying to move a very large angularjs project written in typescript from AMD to CommonJS. I have found several examples online, but cannot find an example that would cover a real project combining the three.p  pstrongShort versionstrong If I remove the TS modules then I cannot find a way to use interfaces in other files unless declaring one per file. If I keep TS modules then it becomes cumbersome to use exported items since I need to declare the require and then go down the whole TS module namespace even within the module itself.p  pstrongLong versionstrong Up to this point I have been using the typescript module system so far and I am happy the way it worked. From what I understand it is not necessary to use the ts module system when using browserify since you are requiring specific parts of the app before using them and it would not be as transparent to use something that polluted the global scope did I get this correct. If I remove everything from inside the typescript modules and have code in snakepagecontroller.ts likep  precodeuse strict  interface ISnakePageController      isLoggedInUser boolean   class SnakePageController implements ISnakePageController      public isLoggedInUserboolean  false      static classNamestring  SnakePageController     static injectstring[]  []      constructor          console.logsnake controller created.        export  SnakePageController codepre  pthen i can use this controller from an index.ts file likep  precode ltreference path....typingsangularjsangular.d.ts gt use strict  import angular  requireangular import directives  require.directives import snakeController  require.snakepagecontroller  var snakeModuleng.IModule  angular.modulemike.snake, [     directives.name ] .controllersnakeController.className, snakeController  export  snakeModule codepre  pThen everything works BUT, p  ol liI can no longer put the export keyword in front of the interface since then the compiler complains about multiple exports per file. So how can I use this interface outside the file it was declared in Do I have to create separate files for each interface and require that this would seem awkwardli lipIf index.ts was written in JS the I would be able to writep  pangular.modulemike.snake, [       require.directives.name ]pli ol  pinline. But if I write this in TS the compiler complains with TS2304 Cannot find name require. This might seem just an annoyance, but I would love to be able to type the required modules inline and not have to import them and use them in two different places.p  pHaving the above difficulties and not being crazy about having to remove the TS module code from 10s of files I tried sticking with the typescript module system and making it play nice with the browserify module system, but...p  pHaving snakepagecontroller written like p  precodeuse strict export module Mike.Snake      export interface ISnakePageController          isLoggedInUser boolean           export class SnakePageController implements ISnakePageController          public isLoggedInUserboolean  false          static classNamestring  SnakePageController         static injectstring[]  []          constructor              console.logsnake controller created.                codepre  pI get access to both the class and the interface outside the file, but I have to drill down the whole module namespace even within the same module ie. p  precodepart of index.ts which is in the same TS module with SnakePageController .controllersnakeController.Mike.Snake.SnakePageController.className, snakeController.Mike.Snake.SnakePageController codepre  pIs there a full blown typescript,angularjs and browserify example out there and I missed itp

In other words, this is what happens p  precode python threading.py   codepre  pI added sys.stdout.flush thinking that stdout needed to be reset, but to no avail. And when I add a random print statement like hello world outside of the while loop in any of the functions, it gets printed. Also, when I run the exact same code in ipython, it prints perfectly. This was copied from a YouTube tutorial, and is not my own code. p  pAny ideas as to why its not printing The Python Im running is 2.7.8. Thanks in advance.p

Negative 1066 pI have a document that is dynamically manipulated with lightboxlike divs being added to and removed from the DOM all the time based on user interactions. Some of these divs contain hyperlinks, and I would like to ensure that whenever any of these anchor elements are clicked, the linked document displays in an iframe, and not the root browsing context. In other words, I need to ensure that all anchor elements added to the DOM have their codetargetcode attribute set to, say, the value codefoocode, as soon as the anchor elements are introduced into the DOM.p  pOne idea that occurred to me was to work with the codeHTMLAnchorElementcode prototype, so that any and all prototypal descendants of it would inherit the value of its codetargetcode property, but I cant quite make that work.p

Negative 1066 pI have an application which launches multiple tasks 1000 and should hopefully scale well into the 10K task area. These tasks are launched gradually at a rate of 100 per minute.

Everything starts freezing and hanging. Download speed goes to 0. Disk write speed goes to 0. Even CPU usage goes to 0, normally its at 10.p  pSo to finally solve this issue, I simply split my application up into 5 separate process limited to 1k tasks each. If i need more, i just spin up a new process.

I havent actually changed anything inside the code that the tasks execute. I simply split the tasks up into multiple processes, and everything is dandy.p  pIsnt the whole idea behind tasks to abstract threads and make efficient concurrency easy Why does it seem to scale so poorly in a single process that i had to split it up in a fewp

Also added a ScriptManager to my MasterPage file inside bodyform and set the attribute strongEnablePageMethodstruestrong.p  pThe problem is, with or without the stronghref, javascriptstrong attribute set on LinkButton, the PageMethod is not calling the MyClick method in the MyClass file. I tried the following two waysp  precodePageMethods.MyClickpar1, par2 codepre  pandp  precodePageMethods.MyClass.MyClickpar1, par2 codepre  pAnd both arent triggering the method. I appreciate any comments or suggestions.p
