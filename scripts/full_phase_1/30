Individual index on each will require intersection which is again a costly operation especially when done for a large number of dimensions.p  pBut i couldnt any suitable nosql database for the same. Most of the spatial databases support only 2dimensional data. Others are OLAP databases which usually are optimized for bulk nontransactional inserts.p  pIs there any high performance nosql database that supports such indexes or such functionality for a large number of dimensions p  pNote NoSQL is preferable as my number of dimensions may vary with each record. But suggestions are welcomed for SQL as well. MySQL supports such a functionality in its codeMYISAMcode engine but it is not transactional and has table level locking, limiting availability.p

Positive 30 pI am interested how the ON CASCADE DELETE is implemented because I would like to have some imagination about the performance of this operation.br Lets say I have 3 tables parent, child FK referencing the parent is ON DELETE CASCADE, grandchild FK referencing the child is ON DELETE CASCADE.br Now I want to delete a row in parent table and also all corresponding entries in child and grandchild tables.br I would like to know which queries are constructed by ON DELETE CASCADE to perform this operation.br Is it something like the following  p  pcodeSELECT child.id FROM child WHERE child.parentid   parentidcode   Then for each returned result from SELECT query the following query is executed   codeDELETE FROM grandchild WHERE grandchild.childid  childidcode    Then the row in child table with id  childid can be deleted.   This is repeated until all children returned by the codeSELECTcode query are deleted. At last the parent can be deleted.br I guess it could be also implemented using some join on the tables, but then the foreign key constraints could fail.p

Positive 30 pI have 5 tables that can contain a phone field, but I want to have the option for multiple phone numbers for each table.p  pInstead of creating 5 sub tables, it makes more sense to create one, and link it to the other 5 parent tables. But now I am thinking of how to link that table to the other 5.p  pMy first thought was to filter on 2 subjects. A field that stores the name of the linked table, and a generic foreign key that contains the key from one of the five tables. Im still leaning this way.p  pNext is the idea of putting 5 foreign keys into the table, and allowing them to be null. I dislike both the idea of 4 null fields. Not to mention I have the same issue with another table that would link to 11 other tables in a similar manner.p  pThe third is a linking or junction table, again I believe, with 5 nullable foreign keys, but this doesnt seem to do anything more then option 2 with a little more complexity.p  p4th option, Im using an autoincrement field for the primary key for most of my tables. I could switch to a UUID or GUID for these tables. Im already set up to use UUID as primary for security reasons, but was using autoincrement for most tables for performance.p  pA 5th option is something I ran into where an autoincrement field was combined with a table name to create a new character field. Only during creation of the table, so technically isnt a calculated field. But again dont see the benefit of this beyond the first option.p  pIs one of these the best way to go, or is there another option I either missed, or do not understandp
Positive 30 pI am considering using node.js to build an API like service but am having trouble understanding whether to use a data structure vs. storing information in a databasetext file.p  pBasically the program would allow for a user to come on line and collect that users geocoded location. Then the service would store that information in either a javascript data structure or store it into a database or text file. Then another user would log on and I would connect them with a user who is closes to them.p  pMy question is, if I have a datastructure some sort of custom implemented sorted list based off of geocodes would all of that information be volatile and I would loose it if the program crashed  p  pWould it be more preferable to store the information in a text file or database even though the access and write of that information would take longerp  pAlso, if I was using the data structure approach, would that make it more difficult to scale the application if I needed to expand to additional serversp  pAny thoughtsp

Negative 30 pIm used to having trycatch blocks in every method. The reason for this is so that I can catch every exception at the point of infraction and log it. I understand, from my reading and conversations with others, that this isnt a popular view. One should only catch what one is prepared to handle. However, if I dont catch at the point of infraction, then it would be possible to never log that infraction and know about it. Note When I do catch and dont handle, I still throw. This allows me to let the exception propagate to something that will handle it, yet still let me log it at the point of infraction.p  pSo... How does one avoid trycatch in every method, yet still log the error at the point at which it occurredp

Negative 30 pI have very little experience with ASP.NET and I am doing some selftraining before I start writing my first web siteapplication, which will be a calibration utility.

However, the utility eventually needs to end up embedded in someone elses web site, either just as a URL to the page with my code, or embedded say, as an HTML frame or an iframe.

I was originally thinking there would be some way to package the entire child into a single DLL, and then there would be some way to tell the parent to use that DLL as the source for the child frame. This comes from my experience in the Java world  using JBoss and J2EE, this would be easily solved because the child would just be deployed as another EAR file.p  pBeing completely inexperienced with VS2008 and ASP.NET, I spent quite a few hours on Google over the past few days trying to find an answer, to no avail.p  ul lipIs what Im trying to do reasonable is it the right way to think about solving the problempli lipCan I deploy the child as a fairly independent and selfcontained web site or web application...

Negative 30 pAn application Im writing needs to use .Net Remoting Im aware that WCF is the new thing, but it is unfortunately not an option available to us at this time.p  pAnyway, everything works fine if I dont try to use the application through a proxy. However, the application needs to be able to function through proxy web servers. I set up a HttpChannel and set the proxyName and proxyPort properties to their correct values. This allows the channel to use the proxy server no problem.p  pI have the following problemsp  p1 If the proxy server requires authentication, there seems to be no way to set the credentials the channel should use to auth with the proxy. Ive tried both the credentials property, and the username and password properties, but it doesnt seem to work. So the end result in a case where the proxy server requires authentication, and just returns an authentication error whenever the remote method is called.p  p2 I cannot seem to get the HttpChannel to use the default system web proxy. If Internet Explorer is configured to use a proxy, I should just be able to use WebRequest.GetSystemWebProxy to get it. However, this returns an IWebProxy, and I cannot extract the host and port from this. If anybody knows of a way to do this, I would greatly appreciate it.p  pWhat is frustrating is that if you step through the code using Visual Studio and examine the HttpChannel class, there is a WebProxy object. Life would be so much easier if they provided access to thatp  pSo basically what Im asking is how on earth do I get a HttpChannel to use a web proxy correctly  bearing in mind that I need to be able to use a proxy which requires authentication, and the ability to autodetect the Internet Explorer proxy settings Is there a simpler way to instantiate the channel so that I can just pass it a proxy object as a parameterp  pAny help is much appreciatedp

Negative 30 pIn my NSFetchedResultsController, I set a sortDescriptor that sorts based on the date property of my managed objects.  The problem that I have encountered along with several others according to Google is that nil values are sorted at the earliest end rather than the latest end of the date spectrum.  I want my list to be sorted earliest, earlier, now, later, latest, nil.  As I understand it, this sorting is done at the database level in SQLite and so I cannot construct my own compare method to provide the sorting I want.p  pI dont want to manually sort in memory, because I would have to give up all of the benefits of NSFetchedResultsController.  I cant do compound sorting because the sectionNameKeyPaths are tightly coupled to the date ranges.  I could write a routine that redirects indexPath requests so that section 0 in the results controller gets mapped to the last section of the tableView, but I fear that would add a lot of overhead, severely increase the complexity of my code, and be very, very errorprone.p  pThe latest idea that I am considering is to map all nil dates to the furthest future date that NSDate supports.  My left brain hates this idea, as it feels more like a hack.  It will also take a bit of work to implement, since checking for nil factors heavily into how I process dates in my app.  I dont want to go this route without first checking for better options.  Can anyone think of a better way to get around this problemp  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pA possible better way to get around this problem would be to switch to a binary persistent store.  From what I have read in the documentation, sorting is done in ObjectiveC with the binary persistent store, so I could supply my own compare method for the date sorting.  I have two concerns with this approach.  First, what kind of performance hit am I going to see by moving to a binary store  Second, how difficult is it going to be to roll out this change in an app updatep

Negative 30 pFor some reason the following code does not work as expected when in IE 8, as noted in the comment.

So go with the extension approach to determine thisp  pEDIT It seems the most reliable way to determine whether to use ACE or JET, is to determine whether ACE in installed, and use that if it is installed. p

Negative 30 pOk, so I have a simple c program thats supposed to run a couple sorting algorithms on an array composed of ints and track the time each one takes.. pretty basic, however Ive run into a problem. p  pWhen the program first starts, it asks how many items you would like in the array. My assignment involves setting the array at specific lengths from 100 items all the way to 750000. Itll handle many values, including up to around 600000. When I try 750000 however it immediately segfaults. A couple couts here and there led me to discover that the error happens when the fourth array all of the same length is initialized. The weird thing is that it only happens on my OS at my school it works no problem. im on the latest ubuntu while my school uses redhat. not sure if thats usefulp  pIll include the complete code just for reference but the segfault occurs at line 27p  precodeint array1[num], array2[num], array3[num], array4[num]  initialize arrays  codepre  pI know this because I initialized each array on separate lines and put couts in between. array1, 2, and 3 were initialized, then it segfaults.

Since the password is hashed its not like you can actually emseeem it, but it feels like bad practice to me.

Basically I need to figure out how much more effort I have to consider if it is only making the app work on the iPad. I do not mean the effort to redesign the whole app being a real iPad app. Just to make it work and when somebody downloads the app and it can be for an iPhone and for an iPad and it does not matter.p

Negative 30 pIm developing an RSS reader type iPhone application and it is nearing completion, however I upgraded to Xcode 4 with iOS 4.3 yesterday and I have run into some serious memory issues.  My App now frequently gets memory warnings, Im handling didReceiveMemoryWarning, and releasing all my cached images etc, but this does not provide a good user experience.  Ive also been using Instruments in an attempt to diagnose the problem, but this has been bringing up more questions then answers.p  p Does the SDK 4.3 use more memory   I wasnt receiving memory warnings before I upgraded.

Does leaks cause extra memory overhead p  p Perhaps this is a difficult question to answer, but what is a reasonable memory footprint for an iPhone app   When Im running leaks, my app will almost certainly be killed due to low memory a few minutes into being run, but allocations in the leaks tool reports Im using less then 2 MB when the app is terminated.p  p Why does the activity monitor instrument have a column for virtual memory   Everything Ive read states that the iPhone does not utilize virtual memory p

Negative 30 pI have a WCF service not RIA that I access from Silverlight. The application has fast incoming data, twitter data of course  which is written to a SQL Server database.

As it stands right now, the images can be up to 2MB in size and Im trying to figure out the best way to transport the data across the wire. p  pI currently am sending the image data as a byte array and the object will have to be stored in memory at least temporarily in order to be written out to the database in this case, a MySQL server so I dont know that using a Stream would help eliminate the potential memory issues or if I am going to have to deal with potentially filling up my memory no matter what I do.

Have googled this one to death   and could use some advice.p blockquote  pI also found ISAPI Filter module but cannot make it work a hrefhttpdevcentral.f5.comweblogsJoearchive20090819xforwardedforlogfilterforwindowsservers.aspx relnofollowdevcentral.f5.comxforwardedforlogfilterforwindowsserversap

Negative 30 pSo, Im having a little trouble trying to make a card reader work properly on a Multifunctional printer and Ive narrowed down my problem to the weird value a string outputs when a byte[] is passed as a constructor argument. I cant really debug the application over the MFP and the logging tool simply doesnt work alongside the cardreading application thats the embedded programming world for you, folks, so my work debugging work is pretty much based on printing values on screen that, sometimes, doesnt quite behave as youd like.p  pOk, here we go when I swipe the card on the reader, my Java program receives a byte[]. Now, there are two ways I can display itp  precode    Supposing that bytes is the byte[] received     BigInteger bi  new BigIntegerbytes bi.toString16 I think it works fine     String str  new Stringbytes Suggested by the developer sucks codepre  pOk. The first one outputs 3538353536. Kinda weird for a hex value, but it is actually the right value since I ran a testp  precode    byte[] bytes  0x35, 0x38, 0x35, 0x35, 0x36     BigInteger bi  new BigIntegerbytes     System.out.printlnbi.toString16 codepre  pConsidering that it returns the same value 3538353536, Ill take it as the actual byte[] value. Now, when I try the second wayp  precode    new Stringbytes codepre  pIn this case, my return value is 58556. Even worse, things are not so happy every time, as passing as an argument something like p  precode    byte9F, byte0xA8, byte0xEE codepre  pwill output [tab  really a tab, not write tab] p  pIve read in a few places that new String bytes was the right way to go, even more so it is the card reader developers example. But it doesnt work. Before I go about questioning the developer, Id like to know what this output means compared to bi.toString16, which seems the right way to go.p  pSorry about the rather lenghty post about a question that could be summarized in two lines, but Id like to make everything crystal clear for a straight, quick answer.p  pstrongEDITstrong Thanks for the input everyone, I got it. Now Im confused whether I should consider the ASCII value 58556 or the hex 0x3538353536  that is, if it is actually supposed to be interpreted as hex  but thats a question Ill take to the developer.p

Negative 30 pI am new to OSGi and created an OSGibundle which I run in the Apache Felix OSGicontainer. There is a file resource contained in the bundle, which I need to pass to a method as a codejava.io.Filecode. To instantiate a Fileobject, either an URI in the filescheme or the path as string is necessary. How do I retrieve any of those in a clean wayp  pI tried using the  codecontext.getBundle.getResourcemyfilecode where context is of type codeorg.osgi.framework.BundleContextcode which returns the URI codebundle6.00myfilecode. But this URI cant be converted to a Fileinstance using the codeFileURI uricode constructor since it has the bundlescheme.p  pOne could try to construct a path to the location knowing the working directory and exploiting the bundleId of my bundle, but I doubt this is the best practice.p  pAny ideas p
Negative 30 pLike many other programmers, I consider enabling emTreat all warning as errorsem a good practice when developing code.

Negative 30 pIm fairly new to DDD and have read a few articles about the concept so pardon if Im lacking some knowledge.

The Comments are tracked according to Employee and Meeting. Every Meeting and Employee have unique identifiers.p  pIf I wanted to display all Comments from a Meeting, regardless of the Employee, would I first have to get all the Employees that belong to that Meeting and then sort through the Comments to only show ones that match the Meeting Id  p  pMeeting cant be my aggregate root because when I need a list of Employees, I certainly do not want to have to go through meetings to get that. Maybe each one is an aggregate root, but Comments do not make sense really outside an Employee.

I did this with Eclipse, Axis2, Tomcat 7, and Java 7.p  pThe basic flow is that the user visits the .jsp and submits a form with input data. The JSP forwards the request object to the Java client. The Java client consumes the web service and submits the user input. The service connects to a SQL Server database via JDBC to retrieve information, which is displayed back to the user.p  pThis all works perfectly over HTTP, but now I want to secure the process, and this is where Im running into problems. Im able to create a cert and get Tomcat to use it. I can connect to the web UI via HTTPS and submit the form and get data back just fine. The problem is that this is only securing the frontend. The web service client code is still connecting to the service via HTTP in the background.p  pAccording to a hrefhttpshivendratripathi.blogspot.com201011enablingsslforaxis2serviceand.html relnofollowthis pagea, all I really need to do to enable my service for connections via SSL is to update the axis2.xml file and include a new transportReceiver node for HTTPS. I did that and regenerated my client code to use the secure endpoint. It doesnt work.p  pI have configured Tomcat to listen on ports 8081 for http and 8443 for https. But after changing axis2.xml to match, and starting up Tomcat, I get the followingp  blockquote   p[INFO] Listening on port 8443  [ERROR] Terminating connection   listener   org.apache.axis2.transport.http.server.DefaultConnectionListener16d60567   after 10retries in 0 seconds.  java.net.BindException Address already   in use JVMBind  at java.net.DualStackPlainSocketImpl.bind0Native   Method  at java.net.DualStackPlainSocketImpl.socketBindUnknown   Source  at java.net.AbstractPlainSocketImpl.bindUnknown Source  at   java.net.PlainSocketImpl.bindUnknown Source  at   java.net.ServerSocket.bindUnknown Source  at   java.net.ServerSocket.Unknown Source  at   java.net.ServerSocket.Unknown Source  at   org.apache.axis2.transport.http.server.DefaultConnectionListener.runDefaultConnectionListener.java80   at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorkerUnknown Source    at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutorWorker.runUnknown Source    at java.lang.Thread.runUnknown Sourcep blockquote  pI have tried changing the port number in axis2.xml for example, to 8445, and that sort of works. The server is able to start cleanly, but eventually, the same errors start showing up. For example, when I retrieve the WSDL, I see the error via the console though the WSDL does show up. Also, if I try to actually use the service when on port 8445, I get the following errorp  blockquote   porg.apache.axis2.AxisFault Connection has been shutdown   javax.net.ssl.SSLException Unrecognized SSL message, plaintext   connectionp blockquote  pI can only assume this is because Tomcat is configured to handle HTTPS on 8443, not 8445, but I honestly dont know.p  pIf I leave the port as 8443 and ignore the errors at startup, I get the following message when I connect to the servicep  blockquote   porg.apache.axis2.AxisFault Connection has been shutdown   javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException   sun.security.validator.ValidatorException PKIX path building failed   sun.security.provider.certpath.SunCertPathBuilderException unable to   find valid certification path to requested targetp blockquote  pI followed a hrefhttpwww.javasamples.comshowtutorial.phptutorialid210 relnofollowthese stepsa to try to get it to recognize my certificate, but when importing it into my JRE7 keystore, I get the followingp  blockquote   pkeytool error java.lang.Exception Certificate reply and certificate   in keystore are identicalp blockquote  pBasically, that cert is already there. Which makes sense, because its the one that Tomcat is already using successfully.p  pSo, Im pretty clueless at this point. Im really not sure what Im supposed to be doing. Any general guidance, or a link to a stepbystep howto would be really helpful.p  pBut for a specific question... What, exactly, am I doing when I set the transportReceiver nodes in axis2.xml Am I telling it what ports Tomcat is running on and that it should use, or does Axis2 have its own servers that will start on those ports It seems to be the latter, but that doesnt make a whole lot of sense to me. p

Negative 30 pstrongShort Questionstrongbr Is it possible to change the system cursor for a selected application Visio 2010 using the codeuser32.dllcodep  pstrongBackgroundstrongbr I am trying to force a cursor to only show as an arrow, or better yet, remap the hourglass pointer to the arrow pointer so that when my Visio application is waiting it will always show an arrow.  Thus far I have been able to load the codeuser32.dllcode and call the codeSetSystemCursorcode, codeLoadCursorAcode, and codeShowCursorcode.  Out of all of the calls made, only codeShowCursorcode works as expected.  p  pThe issue may very well be that I dont fully understand what a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopms64839128vvs.8529.aspx relnofollowcodeLoadCursorcodea and a hrefhttppinvoke.netdefault.aspxuser32SetSystemCursor.html relnofollowcodeSetSystemCursorcodea actually do.  I have linked the best documentation that I could find, which IMO is lacking at best.p  pstrongClosing Thoughtsstrongbr Is there a better way to accomplish this rather than using codeuser32.dllcode the API  Note that Visio 2010 does not, that I can find, control over the Mouse Pointers at all.  p  pstrongFollow Upstrongbr Check out a hrefhttpvisguy.comvgforumindex.phptopic3634.0 relnofollowthis posta for the exact behavior I am trying to get around.  Note that I am not trying to hide the application from showing its busy.  I am trying to get rid of the hourglass flickering every time I change Visio shape data programmatically. a hrefhttpdl.dropbox.comu50490956SOHelpHourglassFlashingExample.vsd relnofollowHerea is a link to the Visio Example I mention in the VisioGuy post, you must be a member of site to view attachments.p  pOriginally I had no intent of using codeLoadCursorcode with codeSetSystemCursorcode, I only associated them because of the documentation I found at Pinvoke.net for codeSetSystemCursorcode.  I had not seen the MSDN documentation for codeSetSystemCursorcode.  Thanks for the tip on Pinvoke... and I dont know why I didnt pull up the MSDN for both of them.p  pAdmittedly, I have not played with system DLLs much.  My main knowledge base is in embedded systems, and OS independent languages ie Python, so the tip about codeSetSystemCursorcode causing global system errors is the kind of information that I really need.p

Negative 30 pstrongUpdate And just minutes after I posted this question here, I think I managed to solve this issue. I think this behavior was due to a newly installed Visual Studio extension called Visual Studio Achievements httpvisualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.combc7a433bb59448d4bba2a2f24774d02fstrongp  pstrongI noticed that the .pdb file was locked by FxCop using Unlocker and I think that the Achievements extension uses it. After disabling the extension Ive no longer got the error mentioned above.strongp  pIm building a project in Visual Studio 2010 and the build fails because it cannot copy the assemblyname.dll file from obj to bin folder. The exact error message isp  pemError 7 Unable to copy file objDebugAssemblyName.dll to binAssemblyName.dll. The requested operation cannot be performed on a file with a usermapped section open.emp  pI think this is because the previous file in binfolder is not accessible. When I try to delete the file manually, I get an error emThe action cant be completed because the file is open in another programem. If I try to see what application locks the file with Unlocker, I dont get any results No Locking handle found. p  pIf I restart Visual Studio, the error goes away but happens again after a build or two. Goes without saying that this is seriously slowing me down. Any advice how to start solving thisp

Negative 30 pIn our DB, every codePersoncode has an ID, which is the DB generated, autoincremented integer. Now, we want to generate a more userfriendly alphanumeric ID which can be publicly exposed. Something like the Passport number. We obviously dont want to expose the DB ID to the users. For the purpose of this question, I will call what we need to generate, the codeUIDcode. p  pstrongNotestrong The UID is not meant to replace the DB ID. You can think of the UID as a prettier version of the DB ID, which we can give out to the users.p  ul liI was wondering if this UID can be a function of the DB ID. That is, we should be able to regenerate the same UID for a given DB ID.li liObviously, the function will take a salt or key, in addition to the DB ID.li liThe UID should not be sequential. That is, two neighboring DB IDs should generate visually differentlooking UIDs. li liIt is not strictly required for the UID to be irreversible. That is, it is okay if somebody studies the UID for a few days and is able to reverseengineer and find the DB ID. I dont think it will do us any harm.li liThe UID should contain only AZ uppercase only and 09. Nothing else. And it should not contain characters which can be confused with other alphabets or digits, like 0 and O, l and 1 and so on. I guess Crockfords Base32 encoding takes care of this.li liThe UID should be of a fixed length 10 characters, regardless of the size of the DB ID. We could pad the UID with some constant string, to bring it to the required fixed length. The DB ID could grow to any size. So, the algorithm should not have any such input limitations.li ul  pI think the way to go about this isp  pstrongStep 1 Hashing.strongp  pI have read about the following hash functionsp  ul liSHA1li liMD5li lia hrefhttpburtleburtle.netbobhashdoobs.html relnofollowJenkinsali ul  pThe hash returns a long string. I read a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma467458623581herea about something called XOR folding to bring the string down to a shorter length. But I couldnt find much info about that.p  pstrongStep 2 Encoding.strongp  pI read about the following encoding methodsp  ul liCrockford Base 32 Encodingli liZBase32li liBase36li ul  pI am guessing that the output of the encoding will be the UID string that I am looking for. p  pstrongStep 3 Working around collisions.strongp  ul liTo work around collisions, I was wondering if I could generate a random key at the time of UID generation and use this random key in the function.li liI can store this random key in a column, so that we know what key was used to generate that particular UID.li liBefore inserting a newly generated UID into the table, I would check for uniqueness and if the check fails, I can generate a new random key and use it to generate a new UID. This step can be repeated till a unique UID is found for a particular DB ID.li ul  pI would love to get some expert advice on whether I am going along the correct lines and how I go about actually implementing this.p  pI am going to be implementing this in a strongRuby On Railsstrong app. So, please take that into consideration in your suggestions.p  pThanks.p  h2Updateh2  pThe comments and answer made me rethink and question one of the requirements I had the need for us to be able to regenerate the UID for a user after assigning it once. I guess I was just trying to be safe, in the case where we lose a users UID and we will able to get it back if it is a function of an existing property of the user. But we can get around that problem just by using backups, I guess.p  pSo, if I remove that requirement, the UID then essentially becomes a totally random 10 character alphanumeric string. I am adding an answer containing my proposed plan of implementation. If somebody else comes with a better plan, Ill mark that as the answer.p

Negative 30 pIm rather new to OOP and have a question about how to best deal with using one class name, but then adding functionality to that class internally based on a parameter passed.p  pBasic story is I have an item class which takes 2 parameters module and id. Some modules but not all will have fancy functionality that the item class wont contain by default.  Some modules will also want to overwrite some of the methods in the item class.  My goal is to be able to call up a modules extension of the item class from within the construct of the item class.  I want to have the single item class though.p  pMy first thought is to create an instance of the modules item extending class when I construct the item class, then, whenever I call a method in the item class, Ill check to see if I have that module specific instance and call the method on that instance.p  pFor examplep  precodeclass item       Variable where Ill store the instance of the child class     var child      Child class may call up items constuct, Ill use this to avoid an infinite loop     var childinitalized      Child called, guess we have to keep track of this so we dont get stuck in infite loops either.     var childcalled  0      Example variables     var id, name      function constructmodule,id          ifthisgtchildinitialized              thisgtchildinitialized  1  So we dont do this again and get stuck in an infite loop             childclass  CLASS..module             ifclassexistschildclass                  thisgtchild  new childclassmodule,id                 return                                 do normal class construction stuff here, such as setting thisgtid and thisgtname         thisgtmodule  module         thisgtid  id            So we can catch child methods not in parent item class     function callname,arguments          ifthisgtchild              return thisgtchildgtname                    function id          thisgtchildcalled  0         ifthisgtchild              thisgtchildcalled  1             return thisgtchildgtid                  return thisgtid        class itemphotos extends item      function constructmodule,id          thisgtchildinitialized  1         parentconstructmodule,id           function id          return photo.thisgtid           function photowidth          return 250  Just some sample value        item  new itemphotos,123 print itemgtid.ltbr gt  photo123 print itemgtphotowidth.ltbr gt  250 codepre  pAnyway, that was just a quick example. However, my method seems...well, wrong.  Any better way to accomplish this or should I be rethinking how Im structuring everything  Any advice or ideas you could offer would be great.p  pstrongememememememememstrong Edit strongememememememememstrongp  pJust to clarify, my goal really is to be able to call one class item in my example and, based on one or more of the params passed to it, to be able to dynamically load more functionality based on those params in my example, its module. But that extra functionality wont always exist so I cant really always call new itemphotos instead of new item.p  pHeres an updated example.  Calling item  new itemvideos,456 at the end of the code is an example of how some modules wont have extra functionality.p  precodeclass item       Variable where Ill store the instance of the child class     public child      Child class may call up items constuct, Ill use this to avoid an infinite loop. Also to avoid when calling child class in methods.     public childinitalized      Example variables     public module, id, name      function constructmodule,id          ifthisgtchildinitialized              childclass  CLASS..module             ifclassexistschildclass                  thisgtchild  new childclassmodule,id                 return                                 do normal class construction stuff here, such as setting thisgtid and thisgtname         thisgtmodule  module         thisgtid  id            So we can catch child methods not in parent item class     function callname,arguments          ifthisgtchild              return thisgtchildgtname                    function id          thisgtchildinitalized  0         ifthisgtchild              thisgtchildinitalized  1             return thisgtchildgtid                  return thisgtid        class itemphotos extends item      function constructmodule,id          thisgtchildinitialized  1         parentconstructmodule,id           function id          return photo.thisgtid           function photowidth          return 250  Just some sample value        item  new itemphotos,123 print photo id .itemgtid.ltbr gt  photo123 print photo size .itemgtphotowidth.ltbr gt  250  item  new itemvideos,456 print video id .itemgtid.ltbr gt  456 print video size .itemgtphotowidth.ltbr gt  nothing that method doesnt exist here codepre  pstrongememememememememstrong Edit 2 strongememememememstrongp  pStill struggling a bit.  I looked into abstract factorys and they dont seem like theyll work.  If I understand them correctly, Id have to declare all methods in the abstract class which is tricky as the modules would be extending the item class so I wouldnt know all the methods. Plus, it seems Id have to call itemphotos or itemvideos instead of just item which is what Im trying to avoid. Not to mention in my example itemvideos doesnt even exist.p  pIn view of my goal of calling one class then, inside that classes construct, determining if there is any extra functionality that needs to be included based on the module, Ive come up with this.  p  pBasically what was the item class gets moved to a new itemcore.  The old item class now just determines which class to use, either the modules item class if it exists ex itemphotos or the core item class itemcore.  After I initialize one of those classes I store the instance and use that whenever I call a method via call, let me know why its bad to use call.p  precodeclass item       Instance of the core class or module class     private instance      function constructmodule,id          class  CLASS         classcore  class.core         classmodule  class..module           Module class         ifclassexistsclassmodule thisgtinstance  new classmodulemodule,id           Core class         else thisgtinstance  new classcoremodule,id           Catch all calls, redirect accordingly     function callname,arguments          ifthisgtinstance              ifmethodexiststhisgtinstance,name return thisgtinstancegtname                class itemcore      public module, id      function constructmodule,id          thisgtmodule  module         thisgtid  id           function id          return thisgtid        class itemphotos extends itemcore      function constructmodule,id          parentconstructmodule,id           function id          return photo.thisgtid           function photowidth          return 250  Just some sample value        item  new itemphotos,123 print photo id .itemgtid.ltbr gt  photo123 print photo size .itemgtphotowidth.ltbr gt  250  item  new itemvideos,456 print video id .itemgtid.ltbr gt  456 print video size .itemgtphotowidth.ltbr gt  nothing that method doesnt exist in the videos module codepre  pAnyone see any problems with this or anyway to improve it It still seems a bit off to me.p  pstrongemememstrong Edit 3 strongemememstrongp  pAlright, seems to me the thing I want to do is be able to return a different instance than I called up.  So, call new itemmodule,id, but if module  photos in my example Id want to return an instance of new itemphotosmodule,id.  So far Ive come up with 2 possible solutions.p  pFirst is what I outlined in Edit 2 see above.p  pSecond option would be to simply call a function probably item and return the correct object instance there since functions can return any object instance you want while the class constructor only returns an instance of its own class.

Looking through the Octeon documentation, I came across a way to profile the spinlocks to be able to see how many times each spinlock had to spin while waiting for the lock to become available. To use this I had to do a conditional compile and then it would increment a counter each time the spinlock spun, then I could query the spinner wait value. So, what I did was to encapsulate the spinlock and added the ability to dump the spinlock spinner wait value for all of the spinlocks used in the system. The actual value didnt mean much, but there were a few that had really high values compared to the rest, and I focused on reducing the contention for those.p  pI know this is probably quite easy for spinlocks, since its just a counter per spin, but reading through the related pthread man pages and header files I havent found anything similar, is there something available for pthread mutexp  pI would really like to avoid having to do something hacky like taking the time before and after each lock.p  pPS Whats the plural of mutex mutexes, muteces, mutexi, muti Mutexes never sounded right to me.p

Negative 30 pIm trying to develop an app that would normally be considered to be malware, but the customers demands are very specific and logical. We have around 50100 cheapset Android phones that are bolted down, plugged in, and the app is supposed to send some of the sensor data via tcp to a remote server. It sounds simple enough, but there are two features that I struggle with since Im not an experienced Android developer, and have never rooted a phonep  p1 The app should be always on. If it crashes, server should get the error report stack trace, and the app should be restarted after 10 minutes one more time before giving up. Also, the OS could theoretically kill the app although I did my best to minimize the memory usage. Id like to somehow handle that as well.p  p2 It would be great if the app could be remotely updated, or autoupdated, with no user interaction whatsoever since there is no conventional user.p  pTo implement 1, I see no other solution than to root the phone AlarmsManager doesnt seem to work as I expected, and adding another application to take care of the first one just feels wrong. Is there anything Im missingp  pI dont know how to approach implementing feature 2 at all. If I put the app on the market and check the keep this application always up to date checkbox while installing it, will that work I fear that the autoupdate would not occur while the service is running, and even if it did, that the OS would not restart the service after installing the update unless feature 1 is implemented. If I programatically download the latest .apk and open it, I still need the user to click the Install button. Im even considering implementing the updateable part in some scripting language.p  pIs there a solution to these problems within the limits of Android APIp  pEDIT Thank you all for your answers, youve been very helpful. It seems that the only way to make Android behave as a nonuser piece of hardware is to root it. Thats the only way to do silent autoupdates. Always on can then be implemented by enabling cron AlarmManager apparently doesnt fire the event in case of service termination via crash, but it could be used by another trivial, noncrashable service to keep the first one running.p

Negative 30 pI need some suggestions on how to resolve the issue I am having. I have tried several different options but hit limitation after limitation. Here is a brief overview of what is going on...p  pWe have 40 tables that hold configuration data that needed to implement CRUD operations. We must use Telerik MVC Grid and preferably the INLINE editing. We must manage the original state and the changed properties on a single object. That object will later be serialized into the database for later approval.p  pInstead of making 40 models, 40 views, 120 crud methodsno delete, that will all closely share the same code except the field names. I am trying to create a way to make this generic enough where we can have 40 models maybe, 1 view, 3 crud methods.p  pI am running into limitation in various areasp  ul liWCF doesnt support genericsli liTelerik grid doesnt support dynamic typesli liWCF doesnt keep methods and private properties intactli liWe are using MEF also, so this is a plugin, inside of a plugin.. i know..li liAdding methods to the WCF layer is not permitted...li ul  pMy Idea I thought I would try creating a class to hold the state, well call it ManagedState. I originally wanted the table models to inherit from it and I had it linked to track changes but this was not working.p  pI also have now tried using the ManagedState class separately from the configuration class and using that strictly to pass back and forth through our WCF service. Then try using that data to create the original type and hydrate it.p  pReally there is so much that has gone into this I am flustered. I have no particular code to share as this is an overall question of how I would implement it as I am hitting brick walls all over. I can post code in future if I get a good response to attempt another method to implement. p

Negative 30 pIm creating an iPhone travel app that uses online as well as offline maps.  For the offline maps I want to allow users to download an mbtiles file of the area they are interested in e.g. London.  The map should have information such as roads etc.. that are already found in OpenStreetmap. Im aware of web sites such as a hrefhttpmetro.teczno.com relnofollowhttpmetro.teczno.coma for downloading Openstreetmap extracts.  What is the easiest way to create mbtiles files of Openstreetmap extracts  Note no map customization is needed.   Ive tried using TileMill, but Im not able to see the correct map information.  Most information on this says to load quite a few other tools and the instructions are not easy to follow or they dont work and since I dont need map customization, it should not really be needed.  My mainpreferred work environments are Windows, Mac and Ubuntu using VirtualBox under Windows in that order.  p  pThanks Tomp

If I comment out the method that does the filtering, it updates the item successfully  but I cant figure out why the filtering is breaking the update.p  pHere is my shortened FormViewp  precodeltaspFormView IDfvData runatserver AllowPagingTrue      DataKeyNamesID DataSourceIDldsData      ondataboundfvDataDataBoundgt     ltEditItemTemplategt         lttable classpad5gt             lttrgt                 lttd classfieldnamegtAREAlttdgt                 lttdgtltaspDropDownList IDcboAREA runatserver DataTextFieldAREANAME DataValueFieldAREA1 SelectedValuelt BindAREA gt DataSourceIDldsAreas gtlttdgt             lttrgt             lttrgt                 lttd classfieldnamegtLOOPlttdgt                 lttdgtltaspTextBox IDtxtLOOP runatserver Textlt BindLOOP gt gtlttdgt             lttrgt             lttrgt                 lttd classfieldnamegtLOOP DESCRIPTIONlttdgt                 lttdgtltaspTextBox IDtxtLOOPDESCRIPTION runatserver              Textlt BindLOOPDESCRIPTION gt stylewidth 600px gtlttdgt             lttrgt         lttablegt          ltaspButton IDbtnUpdate runatserver TextUpdate CommandNameUpdate CausesValidationTrue gt         ltaspButton IDbtnCancel runatserver TextCancel CommandNameCancel CausesValidationFalse gt     ltEditItemTemplategt     ltInsertItemTemplategt         lttable classpad5gt             lttrgt                 lttd classfieldnamegtAREAlttdgt                 lttdgt                     ltaspDropDownList IDcboAREA runatserver DataTextFieldAREANAME                          DataValueFieldAREA1 SelectedValuelt BindAREA gt AppendDataBoundItemstrue DataSourceIDldsAreasgt                             ltaspListItem Text Value gt                         ltaspDropDownListgt                 lttdgt             lttrgt             lttrgt                 lttd classfieldnamegtLOOPlttdgt                 lttdgtltaspTextBox IDtxtLOOP runatserver Textlt BindLOOP gt gtlttdgt             lttrgt             lttrgt                 lttd classfieldnamegtLOOP DESCRIPTIONlttdgt                 lttdgtltaspTextBox IDtxtLOOPDESCRIPTION runatserver              Textlt BindLOOPDESCRIPTION gt stylewidth 600px gtlttdgt             lttrgt         lttablegt          ltaspButton IDbtnInsert runatserver TextInsert CommandNameInsert CausesValidationTrue gt         ltaspButton IDbtnCancel runatserver TextCancel CommandNameCancel CausesValidationFalse gt     ltInsertItemTemplategt ltaspFormViewgt codepre  pThe LinqDataSourcep  precodeltaspLinqDataSource IDldsData runatserver      ContextTypeNameEandI.EAndIDataDataContext EnableDeleteTrue      EnableInsertTrue EnableUpdateTrue EntityTypeName      TableNameINSTRUMENTLOOPDESCRIPTIONs onselectingldsDataSelecting OrderByID ASC gt ltaspLinqDataSourcegt codepre  pMy codeldsDataSelectingcode methodp  precodeprotected void ldsDataSelectingobject sender, LinqDataSourceSelectEventArgs e      EI.FilterDataltINSTRUMENTLOOPDESCRIPTIONgtref e, db.INSTRUMENTLOOPDESCRIPTIONs, this.db  codepre  pAnd finally codeEI.FilterDatacodep  precodepublic static void FilterDataltTgtref LinqDataSourceSelectEventArgs e, IEnumerableltTgt source, EAndIDataDataContext db      if HttpContext.Current.Request.QueryString.Keys.Count gt 0              var result  source.AsQueryable         bool filtered  false           get column names         var columnNames  db.Mapping.MappingSource.GetModeltypeofEAndIDataDataContext.GetMetaTypetypeofT.DataMembers          foreach string key in HttpContext.Current.Request.QueryString.Keys                      string val  HttpContext.Current.Request.QueryString[key]               check the query string key exists as a column in the table, etc             if columnNames.SingleOrDefaultc gt c.Name  key  null ampamp val.Trim   ampamp val                                result  result.WhereLikekey, val.Replace, .Replace,                  filtered  true                                if filtered             e.Result  result       codepre  pIs there any reason filtering the results would break the update and ONLY the DropDownLists  textboxes work fine The filtering works perfectly that is, the FormView only shows the records based parameters entered by the user if youre wondering what the codeWhereLikecode extension method does, you can check out a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11512539usingwildcardswithalinqdatasourcethis questionsa answer.p
Negative 30 pMy question is, how can we associate statistics to posts, for e.g. how is the like count tied to each Facebook post uniquely, or upvote and downvote stats linked to a question here on Stackoverflow. To elaborate further, say there is a question on stackoverflow and I click on the Upvote button, how can the system identify the question for which the upvote button has been clicked to send the stats to the backend DB Since each question is dynamically generated by the users, how is it possible to give a unique ID to the button associated with each question p
Negative 30 pI am trying to implement URL based translation in Zend Framework so that my site is SEO friendly. This means that I want URLs like the below in addition to the default routes.p  precodezend.localenmodule zend.localencontroller zend.localenmodulecontroller zend.localencontrolleraction codepre  pThe above are the ones I have problems with right now the rest emshouldem be OK. I have added a controller plugin that fetches a codelangcode parameter so that I can set the locale and translation object in the codepreDispatchcode method. Here are some of my routes stored in a .ini filep  precode Language  module  Language  controller resources.router.routes.lang1.type  ZendControllerRouterRouteRegex resources.router.routes.lang1.route  [azAZ]2w resources.router.routes.lang1.defaults.controller  index resources.router.routes.lang1.defaults.action  index resources.router.routes.lang1.map.1  lang resources.router.routes.lang1.map.2  module    Language  module  controller  Language  controller  action resources.router.routes.lang2.type  ZendControllerRouterRouteRegex resources.router.routes.lang2.route  [azAZ]2ww resources.router.routes.lang2.defaults.module  default resources.router.routes.lang2.defaults.action  index resources.router.routes.lang2.map.1  lang resources.router.routes.lang2.map.2  controller resources.router.routes.lang2.map.3  action codepre  pAs the comments indicate, several URL structures will match the same route, which makes my application interpret the format incorrectly. For instance, the following two URLs will be matched by the codelang1code routep  precodezend.localenmymodule zend.localenmycontroller codepre  pIn the first URL, mymodule is used as module name, which is correct. However, in the second URL, mycontroller is used as module name, which is not what I want. Here I want it to use the default module and mycontroller as controller. The same applies for the previous codelang2code route. So I dont know how to distinguish between if the URL is of the structure codeenmodulecode or codeencontrollercode.p  pTo fix this, I experimented with the code below in my controller plugin.p  precode Get module names as array dirs  ZendControllerFrontgetInstancegtgetControllerDirectory modules  arraykeysdirs   Module variable contains a module that does not exist if inarrayrequestgtgetModuleName, modules      Try to use it as controller name instead    requestgtsetControllerNamerequestgtgetModuleName    requestgtsetModuleNamedefault  codepre  pThis works fine in the scenarios I tested, but then I would have to do something similar to make the codelang2code route work which possibly involves scanning directories to get the list of controllers. This just seems like a poor solution, so if it is possible, I would love to accomplish all of this with routes only or simple code that is not so hacky. I emcouldem also make routes for every time I want codeencontrollercode, for instance, but that is a compromise that I would rather not go with. So, if anyone knows how to solve this, or know of another approach to accomplish the same thing, I am all earsp

Negative 30 pIm working with EF5 using the modelfirst approach.  Ive designed the model and executed the SQL script which generated the corresponding database using Generate Database from Model.p  pI then had to use UDFs to calculate a couple of column values which requires dropping and readding the columns.  Ive done that in SSMS and then used Update Model from Database... to reflect the changes in the model.p  pTill this point, everything worked great.p  pBut from this point, every time I update the database from the model as described above, the computed columns are overridden with standard columns.p  pFor example, following is an excerpt from the SQL script generated by EFp  precode Creating table ShipmentSet CREATE TABLE [dbo].[ShipmentSet]  [Id] int IDENTITY1,1 NOT NULL, [Details] nvarchar128  NOT NULL, [BarcodeValue] nvarchar32  NOT NULL, [ExecutionDate] datetime  NOT NULL, [RouteId] int  NOT NULL, [IsLocationBarcodeRequired] bit  NOT NULL, [IsPending] bit  NULL, [LastAction] tinyint  NULL  GO codepre  pThe two last columns are computed columns, and their codeStoreGeneratedPatterncode in the model is defined as codeComputedcode.p  pIs there a way to add the computed column formulas in the model The SQL script drops the tables then recreates them, so ignoring these columns wont do.p

Negative 30 pI am developing single page Ajax application pure HTMLCSSJavascript, jQuery, any communication with the PHP server side e.g. reading offers and prices and saving the completed purchases is done through jQuery AJAX requests. HTML form is used only for reading credit card data, they are submitted to PHP server page and all the processing communication with the payment provider is done on PHP serverp  pAll is going OK, except that I have concerns maybe unfounded whether it is possible to accept credit card data in the Ajax form. The main concerns is  if usual HTMLPHP form is submitted e.g. POST submit, then all the traffic between brwoser and server is secure assuming that HTMLPHP form is with https url, etc. But what happens with the AJAX trafic, especially if it is submitted to the other domain using pJSON Is this traffic cryptedp  pMaybe it is not good idea to capture credit card data with AJAX form at allp

I asked the above question because when I removed hFlush from the above program, it runs fast despite it repeats IO using sequence and repeat.p  pWhy only the combination of sequence and hFlush makes it slowp  pTo confirm my new question, I changed my program as follows to do profiling.p  precode LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings  module Main where  import qualified Data.ByteString.Char8 as S import System.IO import Control.Monad  str  S.pack FugaFugaFugaFugaFugaFugaFugaFugaFugaFugaFugaFugaFugaFugaFugaFugaFugaFugan  doIO  S.hPutStr stdout str gtgt hFlush stdout doIO  S.hPutStr stdout str gtgt hFlush stdout doIOWithoutFlush  S.hPutStr stdout str  main  do   hSetBuffering stdout BlockBuffering Just 1000   sequence take 1000000 repeat doIO   replicateM 1000000 doIO   sequence take 1000000 repeat doIOWithoutFlush   return  codepre  pBy compiling and running as followsp  precode ghc O2 prof fprofauto Fuga.hs  .Fuga RTS p RTS gt devnull codepre  pI got the following result.p  precodeCOST CENTRE      MODULE  time alloc  doIO             Main     74.7   35.8 doIO            Main     21.4   35.8 doIOWithoutFlush Main      2.6   21.4 main             Main      1.3    6.9 codepre  pWhat makes the difference between doIO and doIO which do the same task And why doIOWithoutFlush runs fast even in sequence and repeat Are there any reference about this behaviorp  pThanks.p

Negative 30 pWe have a repository Entity Framework which queries for single records  only a single record should exist for any given query. Initially, our queries were codeSingleOrDefaultcode.p  pClearly, multiple results in the query will throw exception and none are wrapped by codetrycatchcode. Rather than wrapping these queries in a codetrycatchcode block, I proposed an extension method as followsp  precode  public static bool IsEmptyltTgtthis IQueryableltTgt Query, out int Count       Count  Query.Count      return Count  0    codepre  pThis has advantages in more ways than simply determining if I have an empty query return or single result return.p  pThe alternative is to wrap my query in a trycatch. My question is whether the extension method or expense of catching an exception is preferred. So as not be subjective, I am specifically referring to the cost of catching and throwing an exception versus the cost of the codeCountcode method.p  pAlthough the database is expected to only return a single record, my approach is that the database will contain unexpected records. I dont perceive this to be an exceptional event, therefore I do not perceive the need for throwing an exception.p  pThe typical implementation of the extension method is as followsp  precode     var query  Repository.All.Where some criteria        int count      if query.IsEmptyout count           handle empty return       else if count gt 1           handle unexpected returns             return query.Single codepre  pstrongEditstrongbr An important note we want to be informed of ambiguous results and how many records are returned.p

Negative 30 pI am having trouble with a piece of C code that is compiled as C producing a linker error from a 3rd package.p  pThe setup is I have lua, oolua, and my program which utilizes the two.

My code occasionally will throw an exception which is expected when constructing an object, and oolua does not handle this error. p  pFrom the reading Ive done compiling lua as C should alleviate this problem and cause the program to not just quit, but the problem is oolua doesnt like lua being C for some reason and I cannot find references to why this could be.p  ptldr If C code is compiled as C what problems could occur with linking assuming it compiles correctly p

Negative 30 pIm working on a system that needs high speed, low latencyjitter communication and its written in C.  We saw there is a new mechanism to get better performance with sockets called Windows Registered IO a hrefhttpwww.serverframework.comasynchronousevents201110windows8registeredionetworkingextensions.htmlhttpwww.serverframework.comasynchronousevents201110windows8registeredionetworkingextensions.htmlap  p...But not available to C at the moment ...and it definitely seems to show better performance based on testing in C.p  pAnyway, Ive written the Managed CCLI part already to create a DLL, and that seems to work fine with C and much improved numbers.p  pBut Im wondering if I can save a buffer copy with the sending...p  pCurrently the C wrapper looks like thisp  precodebool ManagedSendData arrayltbytegt  buf, ULONG bufLen    must pin array memory until were done with sending it,   at which point itll be copied into the unmanaged memory     pinptrltBytegt p  ampbuf[0]    pinning one element of an array pins the whole array    unsigned char  cp  p     return RIObsgtSendData cp, bufLen   codepre  pWhere codeRIObscode is the unmanaged C object that implements the Registered IO functionality.  In that function, it will copy the data into the buffer that was registered at the startup with codeRIORegisterBuffercode, and then call codeRIOSendcode to notify the OS that there is data to send.p  pSo, my question is can I have the user of this Managed C object pass in a managed byte array on startup and call codeGCHandleAlloccode on it to fix it in place and prevent garbage collection, call codeRIORegisterBuffercode on it in the managed application, and then use it while the managed C object is alive  I will register that managed buffer memory instead of unmanaged memory, and when the user wants to send data, they will fill up the buffer they already have a reference to, and just notify me how many bytes they want to send.  Its a blocking send and waits for a completion event, so they wouldnt be using the buffer again until the OS is done its thing with the data.p  pIt seems it would work as long as unmanaged applications can use managed or unmanaged memory interchangeably as long as the managed memory is locked down until its not longer needed.p
Negative 30 pI need to change the permission of devtty file as I am writing data on that port.

Negative 30 pIm pretty new to creating dynamic data websites  I created one a year ago that is working fine but now Im trying a 2nd one and having a strange problem.  p  pIm using VS2010, VB.net amp followed MSs waltkthrough for creating a web site using Linq to SQL. Things seem to be working with one MAJOR exception.  Ive pointed it to a SQL server in my domain but it wont display rows from the DB that were not created through the website.  Records that I manually enter through SSMS do not show in the DD List for the table, but rows I inserted thru the website do appear.  p  pI have cleared the table and refreshed the list view and all rows disappear.  Then if I add rows via SSMS they do NOT show up but website added ones do.  This is important because Im going to be importing data from an old non SQL DB that Im converting.p  pI really dont know where to look to resolve this  Does anyone have any ideasp  pThanksp

Negative 30 pI have a proper delegate protocol created in ObjectiveC and Im updating it.

Like sop  precodeif [self.delegate respondsToSelectorselectorrequestFailedWithError]      [self.delegate requestFailedWithErrorerror]  codepre  pNow Ive updated. In the update it looked like a better option was to divide the function into unique error returns based on when the error occurs, because the uses of this method grew to more than two places and could have very different responses. This allows the consumer to ignore particular types of errors or at the very least handle each error differently without giant codeifcode statements. These are the new delegate methodsp  precodeprotocol MyDelegate ltNSObjectgt  optional  voidaRequestFailedWithErrorNSError error  voidbRequestFailedWithErrorNSError error   voidrequestFailedWithErrorNSError error DEPRECATEDATTRIBUTE  end codepre  pIn the class Im calling them as expected but Im failing over to the deprecated method if the class hasnt implemented the newer method.

Since i dont think each value stored would be a rational number i dont see how this would be appropriate.p  pmpft is for floating numbers. Since this has limited precision I dont see how this would be useful to use for my variables since the main reason I was told to use mpir was for increased precision.p  pI just want to be able to represent my numbers in an accurate way and the whole reason I was using this was because i was told it would help maintain accuracy when doing arithmetic between really big and small numbers.

Negative 30 pI must mention that this is my first time posting on this site, forgive me if I dont follow this sites guidelines to the tee. p  pMy problem is probably simple but I cant understand it. My knights tour algorithm recursively finds a path for a knight. It works on index [0,0], it iterates through the spaces of the array perfectly... however, on anything but index [0,0], the program hangs for what seems like an eternity. Here is my codep  precode knightstour.py   created by M. Peele  section 01    This program implements a bruteforce solution for the Knights tour problem   using a recursive backtracking algorithm. The Knights tour is a chessboard   puzzle in which the objective is to find a sequence of moves by the knight in   which it visits every square on the board exactly one.

Negative 30 pI have services that return large objects, default transfermode buffered doesnt suit to our requirements. p  pActually the service is written already and the project team is experiencing out of memory exceptions and slow performance intermittently. Now this needs to be fixed with some patching, rewrting all the services is not an option as the project team is nearing a delivery.p  pI have an understanding that changing the transfermode to StreamedResponseStreamed may help in a big way  choosing net.tcp instead of http bindings intranet application with thick client. I need to know whether I will get benefit for all the operationcontracts or only those, which return StreamMessage.p  pI created a little sample to check if it has any impact on other return types DataTableDataSet and it strongseemsstrong it effects all the return types including DataTableDataSet. I checked a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4043683wcfhttptransportstreamedvsbufferedtransfermodeWCF HttpTransport streamed vs buffered TransferModea and looks like the same behavior is experienced by others as well. p  pThe only thing missing here is some concrete documentation which clearly states that it effects all the operationcontracts irrespective of return type. I need some references so that I can push my recommendation for this chnage.p  pPlease do not suggest not to return DataTableDataSet from the services strongI know its a badbad practicestrong and should be avoided all the times but in this case the services were already there and I cant ask them to change everything at this moment.p  pstrongUpdatestrong  My perception is based on following testp  pMy interface p  precode[ServiceContract] public interface IMediaManager      [OperationContract]     Stream Playint mediaId      [OperationContract]     DataSet GetJunk  codepre  pMy Implementationp  precodepublic class MediaManager  IMediaManager      public Stream Playint mediaId              String path  GetMediamediaId         FileStream fStream  new FileStreampath, FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read,FileShare.Read         return fStream           public DataSet GetJunk              return GetLargeJunkDataSet20PlusMegs       codepre  pHosted over IIS  Non Http WAS, Server Configuration File Tags stripped off, only relevant onesp  precodeltsystem.serviceModelgt ltservicesgt   ltservice nameMediaService.MediaManager behaviorConfigurationMediaServiceBehaviorgt     lthostgt       ltbaseAddressesgt         ltadd baseAddressnet.tcplocalhost9876MediaServiceMediaManager.svc gt       ltbaseAddressesgt     lthostgt     ltendpoint address bindingcustomBinding               bindingConfigurationStreamedTcpBinding nameMediaManagerTcp               contractMediaService.IMediaManager gt     ltendpoint addressmexTcp bindingmexTcpBinding namemexTcp               contractIMetadataExchange gt   ltservicegt ltservicesgt ltbindingsgt   ltcustomBindinggt     ltbinding nameStreamedTcpBinding sendTimeout001000 receiveTimeout001000gt       ltbinaryMessageEncoding gt       lttcpTransport transferModeStreamed portSharingEnabledtrue  gt     ltbindinggt   ltcustomBindinggt ltbindingsgt codepre  pp  pClient Configuration File Only relevant tagsp  precodeltbinding nameMediaManagerTcp closeTimeout000100 openTimeout000100       receiveTimeout001000 sendTimeout000100 transactionFlowfalse       transferModeStreamed transactionProtocolOleTransactions       hostNameComparisonModeStrongWildcard listenBacklog10 maxBufferPoolSize2147483647       maxBufferSize1001 maxConnections10 maxReceivedMessageSize2147483647gt       ltreaderQuotas maxDepth32 maxStringContentLength8192 maxArrayLength16384         maxBytesPerRead4096 maxNameTableCharCount16384 gt       ltreliableSession orderedtrue inactivityTimeout001000         enabledfalse gt       ltsecurity modeNonegt         lttransport clientCredentialTypeWindows protectionLevelEncryptAndSign gt         ltmessage clientCredentialTypeWindows gt       ltsecuritygt     ltbindinggt codepre  pIf you see above, the strongemmaxBufferSizeemstrong is 1001 bytes, however the actual message would be 20 mb.

Negative 30 pI have a small project to create in a course at my University that requires using the Crypto libraries.

Negative 30 pIf you play an HTML5 video for a video that is hosted on a server that accepts range requests, then when you try to seek ahead to a nonbuffered part of the video youll notice from the network traffic that the browser makes a byte rangerequest. Im assuming that the browser computes the byte by knowing the total video size ahead of time and assuming a constant bitrate if you click halfway in the progress bar, then it will request the byte at the halfway point. But especially if the video is variable bitrate, it seems unlikely that the byte it requests could really correspond to the timepoint that the user clicked on, and the byte would likely fall in the middle of a frame.p  pHow does the browser know what the beginning of the next frame is, once its begun fetching at some arbitrary bytep

Negative 30 pIn Visual Studio, I can put an xml string into the Value field. However, when I open up the actual .resx file, I see that it has been encoded to have codeampltcode and codeampgtcode.

Could I somehow do this without the encodingp
Negative 30 pI have a simple chat server node.jsexpresssocket.io that Im accessing from a client on a different domain.  Ive already set the origins to allow everything, which has worked.

Im allowing the origin both with codeio.setorigins, code and withp  precodeapp.all, functionreq, res, next    res.headerAccessControlAllowOrigin,    res.headerAccessControlAllowHeaders, XRequestedWith   next . codepre  pIve tried pretty much everything I can think of disabling heartbeats, catching the error and reconnecting on the client, using codeio.server.removeListenerrequest, io.server.listenersrequest[0]code.  I know this is a crossdomain problem, because I dont have any issues when I run it locally.  Any ideasp

Negative 30 pWe need a bit of help, we have been trying to manage this and it simply isnt working.  Basically we have a site that uses entity framework and ADO.NET as a mixture, we do this as some selects would simply not work with the way we are getting data using a publishing structure and on some saves using entity framework would be impossible or take minutes to save with the volume of data selected and manipulated.p  pAt the beginning of a request we have a connection provider which tries to manage the connection and either provides a standalone SqlConnection for ado.net reads or a single connection object which is used with EF and any ado.net sprocs that may do updates, we can then call save changes which commits the transaction scope.  p  pUnfortunately this simply isnt working, we would like to avoid escalation to MSDTC but if there is no other way we will live with it.  The question is should we at the start of the request create a single sqlconnection and share it with everything or should we just create a SqlConnection object for everything independently and use transaction scope and let it do what it needs to even if we get escalated to MSDTC.p  pSome of the errors we are seeing arep  precode Cannot promote the transaction to a distributed transaction because there is an active save point in this transaction.  Cannot use SAVE TRANSACTION within a distributed transaction.  The transaction has aborted.  The operation is not valid for the state of the transaction. codepre  pWe are also getting timeouts where I believe a standalone connection is attempting to select from a table participating in the transaction but using a connection not inside the transaction.p  pI would appreciate any advice here as what we have tried simply isnt working.p
Negative 30 pI migrated my project from Qt4 to Qt5. In Qt4 in combination with CMake there were the variables QTINCLUDEDIR and QTLIBRARYDIR. They are missing in Qt5. What I need is a replacement for these two variables because I have a few headerslibraries located in the Qt installation Like QScintilla2p  pI use Qt5Widgets as module and my first idea was to use this path and use a .. to get the parent path  but a Qt5WidgetsLIBRARIES returns the library name and not the path Cut off the library . Also the return value of Qt5WidgetsINCLUDEDIRS looks like one huge appended path without whitespaces between different include directoriesp  pSo  any ideas or solutions  The solution should be compatible for UnixLinux, OS X and Windowsp
Negative 30 pIm trying to align five horizontal menu elements with floatleft next to each other inside a container that spans 80 of the screen and a minimum of 960px.

I could see no such option in Java, I checked many examples online with help in parsing most of them do not go beyond the basics.p  pAm I on right path with DOM parser or should I try some other parser for XMLp  pI have quite a big XML file which I cut down to fit which has to be parsed.p  pHow can I get value in XML node CANDELA  ECUDOC  ECU  VAR  DIAGCLASS  DIAGINST Is it possible get set of nodes as XMLList in Actionscriptp  precodeDocumentBuilderFactory builderFactory  DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance         DocumentBuilder builder  null         try              builder  builderFactory.newDocumentBuilder             Document document  builder.parsenew FileInputStreampathToXML              NodeList nodes  document.getElementsByTagName              forint i  0 i lt nodes.getLength i                 System.out.printlnnodes.itemi.getNodeName                          System.out.printlnNumber of childs under ECU  nodes.getLength          catch ParserConfigurationException e              e.printStackTrace           ltxml version1.0 encodingiso88591 standalonenogt ltDOCTYPE CANDELA SYSTEM candela.dtdgt ltCANDELA dtdvers2.0.5gt     ltECUDOC doctypeinst manufacturerno mid323232 saveno59 languagesenUS,deDE uptodateLanguagesenUS jobfileextgt         ltATTRCATSgt             ltATTRCAT id0x01ded158gt                 ltNAMEgt                     ltTUV xmllangenUSgtTimeltTUVgt                     ltTUV xmllangdeDEgtZeitltTUVgt                 ltNAMEgt                 ltQUALgtZeitltQUALgt             ltATTRCATgt         ltATTRCATSgt         ltAUTHORSgt             ltAUTHOR id0x01dfae70 obs0gt                 ltLASTNAMEgtRtzltLASTNAMEgt                 ltFIRSTNAMEgtChristophltFIRSTNAMEgt             ltAUTHORgt         ltAUTHORSgt         ltECU id0x01da31c8gt             ltNAMEgt                 ltTUV xmllangenUSgtAny ECU exampleltTUVgt                 ltTUV xmllangdeDEgtEin BeispielSteuergertltTUVgt             ltNAMEgt             ltDESCgt                 ltTUV xmllangenUS struct1gt                    ltPARAgt                         ltFCgtThis is an manufacturer independent example to demonstrate the usage of CANdelaStudio.ltFCgt                     ltPARAgt                     ltPARAgt                         ltFCgtltFCgt                     ltPARAgt                     ltPARAgt                         ltFCgtThis example is based on the Vector document template manufacturer independent.ltFCgt                     ltPARAgt                     ltPARAgt                         ltFCgtFor a concrete project, we recommend to use a manufacturer specific document template, which must be generated by Vector at the time.ltFCgt                     ltPARAgt                 ltTUVgt                 ltTUV xmllangdeDE struct1gt                     ltPARAgt                         ltFCgtDies ist ein herstellerunabhngiges Beispiel.

Negative 30 pIm using the a hrefhttpjqueryvalidation.org relnofollowjQuery Validation Plugina, and I have a problem. Both my codejQuerycode and codeHTMLcode is perfectly valid according to codeJSLintcode and the codeWC3 Markup Validation Servicecode, but when I hit the submit button, nothing happens.br My code even clearly states that, upon submitting, an alert should pop up, but even that doesnt work. The form is however validated correctly, and in the and, all fields are green  meaning they passed validation but it doesnt actually submit nothing happens.br Also, in my codeDevToolscode, the console does not report any errors.  p  hr  pemPossiblyprobably relevantem the emailtextfield and the usernametextfield are both being checked by a remote codePHPcode script. This script works, strange enough, strongonlystrong after the second time. So when I first leave codeblurcode the emailtextfield, nothing happens, its isnt marked correct nor false.br  Only when I reenter and leave the textfield for the second time, it is validated, or when I hit the submit button. emThis shows the submit button is actually connected, it just simply does not submitemp  pI really hope someone will solve my problem. Im not trying to just let someone else do the work.

Negative 30 pIm trying to write a loop that will find all the instances of arbitraryTextHere in an input string. E.g p  blockquote   psomeTextfindMemoreTextfindMeTooEvenMoreTextDontForgetMep blockquote  pHere is my code p  precode    Pattern placeholderPattern  Pattern.compile[wd]     Matcher placeholderMatcher  placeholderPattern.matchertemplateString      int workingIndex  0     whileplaceholderMatcher.find         workingIndex  placeholderMatcher.start      codepre  pNote The templateString Im testing this out with is codeSomeString somePropcodep  pThe strange thing is that code.findcode has to return true in order to get inside the loop, but then code.startcode throws an IllegalStateException. The reason why this is so strange is that code.startcode only throws an IllegalStateException if the matchers internal codefirstcode variable is less than 0, but code.findcode, via the Matchers codeboolean searchint fromcode method, will make sure that codefirstcode is zero or greater unless no match is found, but if no match is found then code.findcode will return false, and we wont wind up in the loop body. p  pSo what exactly is going on here p  pUpdate So If I encapsulate the above code so that it all runs in one unit test then it works. So I think the problem is related to having it in a class whos method is called from the unit test. But thats kind of weird. Im going to dig into this aspect of the problem a bit more and then post an update. p  pUpdate Ok, well I tried turning it off again and on again I restarted my IntelliJ and recompiled my code and now its not broken anymore, so I think i must have screwed something up in that department. p

I want to add an integer variable to it.  brThe usual way of adding variables which is right clicking the edit box and add variable is greyed out. I presume that its because I havent declared a separate class for the dialog, since the variable is used only in Dialog A code I dont want to add a separate class for Dialog B. brWhat should I do pThanks.p

Negative 30 pOK so I have been working on an app that will be available in multiple languages. p  pI have managed to get it working in the main languages, such as French, German, Spanish and English.p  pI have also now managed to get the app to use different regions within a language such as enGB, enUS etc etc so all is good  thanks to this guide a hrefhttphamishrickerby.com20100723iphoneipadlocalizationsregions relnofollowhttphamishrickerby.com20100723iphoneipadlocalizationsregionsap  pOne of the most important languages for me is Welsh. Apple allows me to set my iPhone to welsh by choosing British English as my language and region format as Welsh United Kingdom.p  pI have created the Welsh language localisation within my app and translated my bits but I dont seem to be able to apply it.p  pMy idea was that if the users language was set to British English that I could have a button on the main view that would allow the user to chose Welsh. Is this possible and what would be the best way to implement it.p  pIdeally if the user has already set their language to British english and has the region format to welsh they will get the welsh language version of the app just like the french would automatically get the french language version and the spanish will get the spanish version of the app etc but as most welsh speaking users will have their phone set to United Kingdom as they are not aware of the Welsh Region setting in iOS. p  pI would like the app to detect if the current language is British English and display a button on the home screen where the user can switch to Welsh Language. I have managed to display this button only if user language is British English but have no idea how to link it to change the languagep  pAnyone have any ideas or maybe a suggestion on the best way to implement my goal.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 30 pWe are using LibCurl for our SetTop Box applications. It is used in multithreaded environment and we may open multiple curl handles at the same time but we close it as soon as the download is done. p  pIt seems like while opening the curl handle no matter how much we download, curl allocates some memory which increases as the number of curl handle increases I tested a scenario with 100 threads  where about 30Mb of memory is allocated in advance. as soon as we call curleasyinitthere is jump in the memory which is not deallocated after the handle is destroyedp  pIn our applications, For example one curl handle may be just used to see if the server is up or not  but even this is costing us memory.p  pMemory is very critical in our scenario. So, we do not want curl to cache that much of memory in advance.p  pIs there any suggestions that can help us to reduce the memory cached by curlp

Negative 30 pRecently I am tasked with reducing the file sizes of PDF generated from blank office documents. p  pThe images are mostly blank, but they have a variety of company letterheads in color, borders and footers. Some are generated by software and therefore have very clean pixels, others are scanned by desktop scanners.p  pBeing blank, what I mean is center part of the page two inches away from each margin will be absolutely blank and white.p  pMy boss want to keep these PDFs in color, but wouldnt mind making them fuzzier as long as they are not too ugly. p  pI have tested with many file reduction schemesp  ul liDifferent color compression methods FlateDecode, LZWDecode, DCTDecode, ...li liDifferent JPEG quality settingsli liReducing the pixel width and height of the JPEG, and only stretch it up when the PDF is displayed.li liCutting up the image content into smaller patches of images. li ul  pSo far, I have found that the third method reducing pixel dimensions was more effective than reducing the JPEG quality settings say, scaling image down 50 as opposed to dropping quality from 50 down to 20p  pHowever, one approach that has eluded me in some of the sample PDFs we collected from other companies is that some had JPEG images that are strongmultistage filteredstrong. What I mean is thatp  ul liThe Filter name is an array of two DCTDecode, FlateDecodeli liwhen the PDF was generated, JPEG compression was applied first, and then it was Deflated. Upon viewing the PDF, the data was first Inflated and then JPEG decompressed into pixels.li ul  pI applied the first step of decompression the FlateDecode to the multistage filtered data, giving the original JPEG data. I used a hex viewer to inspect the JPEG data, and found that in the blank areas of the JPEG image, most of the bytes are repeated patterns. This explains why it would be advantageous to apply a secondary compression on top of an JPEG file  if only one knows that JPEG image is mostly blank.p  pApparently those PDFs were also created by iText. However, it is not clear to me if there is an instance of the codeiTextSharp.text.Imagecode class that supports this combination of twostage filtering.p  pIn case iText does not have builtin support for creating such twostage compressed images, would it be possible to insert an image if I handle the twostage compression and use something like a hrefhttpapi.itextpdf.comitextcomitextpdftextpdfparserPdfImageObject.html relnofollowPdfImageObjectap

Negative 30 pIm having a math brain fart moment, and google has failed to answer my quandary. p  pGiven a sequence or list of 2 item tuples from a Counter object, how do I quickly and elegantly get python to spit out a linear sequence or array of all the possible combinations of those tuples My goal is trying to find the combinations of results from a Counter object.....p  pFor example clarity, if I have this sequence  p  precode[500, 2, 250, 1]   codepre  pDoing this example out manually by hand, it should yield these resultsp  precode250, 500, 750, 1000, 1250.  codepre  pBasically, I THINK its ab for the range of b and then add the resulting lists together... Ive tried this where cCounter objectp  precoderes  [[kj1 for j in rangec[k]] for k in c] codepre  pAnd it will give me backp  precoderes  [[250], [500, 1000]] codepre  pSo far so good, its going through each tuple and multiplying x  y for each y... But the resulting list isnt full of all the combinations yet, the first list [250] needs to be added to each element of the second list. This would be the case for any number of results I believe.p  pNow I think I need to take each list in this result list and add it to the other elements in the other lists in turn. Am I going about this wrong  I swear there should be a simpler way. I feel there should be a way to do this in a one line list comp.p  pIs the solution recursive Is there a magic import or builtin method I dont know about My head hurts......p

Negative 30 pIn my Application, there is a modeless dialog box which has one static control and some customized controls  Edit box, buttons. Actually we are enhancing the functionality of this dialog and added 2 more static controls. The dialog box has CLIPSIBLINGS and CLIPCHILDREN styles.p  pThe Problem I am facing is in WinXP, when some other window gets overlapped on this dialog, every other control is getting painted properly except the newly added static controls. But there is no particular difference between the existing static controls and the ones I added. This is solved with explicitly calling Invalidate method of the static control in dialogs OnPaint method, but still I didnt get why the existing controls are painted fine.p  pI tried removing CLIPCHILDREN style, then it worked fine but there is a lot of flickering.  Please help me understand the same, I have gone through so many threads relating to the same but I didnt find the answer.p

Negative 30 pSo I am writing an automated theorem prover as a project for a database management class I am taking. I decided to implement it as a CGI program in Perl. I am also going to write a paper to go along with the program which points out the inefficiency of the strategy I am using, which is resolution refutation on a set of clauses using a breadthfirst SOS strategy. p  pWhich is a good segue into my question. You see, the program works fine for small sets of clauses. However, with larger sets I run into a problem. p  pFor example, I just tried to run it on a set of 16 clauses. The number of new clauses that need to be generated using this strategy to get the empty set is rather large for this particular set of clauses, but I am confident that, given enough time, the program can find the empty set.p  pThe thing is, every time I try to load the program with these inputs, the browser automatically stops loading the page somewhere between the 7080th clause generated.p  pIs there a work around that would allow me to load the program in its entirety and get the final results p  pAnyones help on the matter is greatly appreciated. I really dont want to rewrite the program as a noncgi program, but it appears this might be my only option.p

Previously I would include a functions folder that contains various php files labelled things like image.upload.functions.php and general.error.handling.functions.php etc.p  pHowever, this time Im using classes wherever possible.p  pI have just read that in order to use a parents methods in an extended class you must run the parents constructor however I havent done this and my project seems to work ok.p  pSo.. I have a class called Form Validation I have another class called Process Login that extends Form Validation.p  pMy Form Validation class does things like test a password strength to make sure it is strong enough, check whether a user is in the database etc.p  pI extend Form Validation with a Registration class and a Forgotten Passowrd class.p  pShould I be puttingp  precodeparentconstruct codepre  p..in the constructor of each of the extended classes p  pCould someone explain simply the reasons why we do OR do not do this And whether its something I should be doingp  pMany thanks p

Negative 30 pI am working on using Azure to maintain a web application that will allow me to store information into a storage system through a web interface. I would then like to query the information from that storage system using a client application. I noticed that there are a variety of technologies that can be used to accomplish this, such as node.js, C, php and python. I am confused about how to proceed. I tried to create a website on Azure using Microsoft WebMatrix which uses Nodejs, and I was able to create a simple express site. But, I could not see any options for a storage element to interface with node.js. I am not looking to spend too much time on making a custom Web UI, but would rather like to use some sort of template for the UI. Which technologies would be best to proceed based on my requirementsp  pThanksp

Dont get me wrong, im happy its working that easy, but i think i cant be sure the data is already written to the hasmap when i return, and thus get into trouble with maybe a slower network connection.p  pAm i right and can anyone tell me, why the callback is called before i return from this methodp  pIs this maybe the case, because the data is somehow buffered, and android is calling the callback immidiately when its setting the result callback p

Negative 30 pIve read the question and answer a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions742013howtocodeaurlshortenerHow to code a URL shortenera and all the math makes perfect sense.  My question is, since you have to go back to the databasedatastore anyway for the lookup, why not just generate a random short string in your alphabet and store it with the full URL in your datastore, rather than converting it back to a numerical IDp  pIt seems to me that this saves doing any math on the server, reduces complexity, and eliminates the walkability of the short URL space for my usecase, this is critical URLs must not be guessed.  If using a NoSQL store designed for keyvalue lookup, it doesnt seem that there is any potential performance issue of looking up the full URL value from a string as opposed to a numerical ID.p  pId like to know if Im missing something.p
Negative 30 pFor this question please refer to a previous question I asked a while back a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11277860doineedtthreadsifsocanipauseresumeandstopthemDo I need TThreads If so can I pause, resume and stop thema a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comusers576719lurdLU RDa answered the question with a provided demo and some comments.p  pI stopped using Delphi for quite a long time but now I am getting back into it and redoing a project. This project has time consuming operations such as opening a Gif, extracting the frames and then adding those frames bitmaps into a TImageList and TListView. This time I actually add the bitmaps directly into a TObjectList, as seen here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions24456190howtoaddandretrievebitmapstoandfromatlistHow to add and retrieve Bitmaps to and from a TListap  pTypically nothing special needs doing here to speed it up as most Gif animations are small, but with medium to large Gifs the application can hang. This is going to get worse though as those bitmaps are going to be modified at runtime using various imaging filters such as grayscale, change hue etc. So I am sure I need multithreading for this otherwise accessing each bitmap and then manipulating is going to be very slow as I found out before.p  hr  pSo with that said, I am foolishly trying to adapt without a clue of what I am doing some of my procedures to work with the TThread example posted by a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comusers576719lurdLU RDa I linked to at the top.p  pI wish I spent a bit more time with the original question to ask for more information but I guess I got sidetracked and moved onto something else, which meant I learned nothing.p  pTake this snippet from the threading examplep  precodeconst   cWorkLoopMax  500  function TForm1.HeavyWork boolean  True when ready var   i, j integer begin   j  0   for i  0 to 10000000 do     Incj   IncworkLoopIx   Result  workLoopIx gt cWorkLoopMax end codepre  pFor a start I have no idea what codecWorkLoopMaxcode is for, and why its value is set to 500p  pSecondly I guess the codeHeavyWorkcode procedure is just a sample, which runs in a loop a 10000000 times whilst incrementing the codejcode variablep  pThen we have the codeworkLoopIxcode which I am unsure what is for Maybe something to do with the position within the thread maybep  hr  pSo, here I have my current code no threading which handles opening the Gif and adding to the TListView and TImageList. The procedures I use are in another unit, if needed I will post it also, but this is what I use inside a TAction actOpenp  precodeif OpenPictureDialog.Execute then begin   Screen.Cursor  crHourGlass   try     BitmapCollection.AddFromGifOpenPictureDialog.FileName, ImageList1      ListView1.Items.BeginUpdate     try       ListView1.Items.Clear        for I  0 to BitmapCollection.BitmapList.Count  1 do       begin         with ListView1.Items.Add do         begin           Caption  bitmap  IntToStrI1           ImageIndex  I         end       end     finally       ListView1.Items.EndUpdate     end   finally     Screen.Cursor  crDefault   end end codepre  pWhat I dont understand is how to put that into a thread procedure, such as codeHeavyWorkcode I just created a new one called codeJobOpencode and did thisp  precodeprocedure TForm1.actOpenExecuteSender TObject begin   if OpenPictureDialog.Execute then   begin     if not AssignedMyThread then     begin       workLoopIx  0       btnStartTask.Enabled  false       btnPauseResume.Enabled  true       btnCancelTask.Enabled  true       MyThread  TWorkerThread.CreateSelf.Handle, WMMyProgress, JobOpen     end   end end  function TForm1.JobOpen boolean var   I Integer begin   BitmapCollection.AddFromGifOpenPictureDialog.FileName, ImageList1    for I  0 to BitmapCollection.BitmapList.Count  1 do   begin     with ListView1.Items.Add do     begin       Caption  bitmap  IntToStrI1       ImageIndex  I     end     IncworkLoopIx   end    Result  workLoopIx gt BitmapCollection.BitmapList.Count cWorkLoopMax end codepre  pThis is clearly not right, the performance is slower and I am getting all kind of errors such as Invalid Handle.p  pI would be extremely grateful if someone could take some time to explain my comments, what I am doing wrong and what I should be doing instead, updated code and comments in source are welcome but I am hoping to learn a bit more of what is going on with the code ideally.p  pIn a perfect world if there is a library of sorts that exists out there that is easy to use then that would be a massive help if I cannot understand what is happening above. Is there such a library that can do something likep  precodeprocedure DoSomething begin   BeginThreading     HeavyWork   StopThreading end codepre  pThanks in advance, and apologies for the lengthy post.p

Negative 30 pI have a SQL SERVER 2008R2 Standard Edition. The Cube has one measure called AUM. Basically this measure is only additive across One Dimension Portfolio.p  pAcross Time I need to pick LastChild, Across Security I need to pick Max and Across Portfolio I need to pick SUM. p  pHow should I create the measure  what should be the Aggregation property to achieve all 3 types of calculations.p  pcurrently we have written SCOPE statement for Security and Time to overwrite Default SUM behavior. this works great but as the members in security and Time Dimension increases the SSRS reporting query gets slow down a lot.p  pI am currently testing creating new persisted measures with changing the property of aggregations and combinations of some additional create member statements to see if I can avoid scope statements.p  pAny kind of help be great.

Negative 30 pWe have started facing an issue in the past months where the method strongcodeSystem.Drawing.Bitmap.Savestring filenamecodestrong stops working after the server has been running for several hours. The hours after which it starts failing are proportional to the server load. p  pThis code involved with that call has been working perfectly well for several years, it gets and image from the user, resizes it and saves it to disk.

It is a generic exception that is raised for many different reasons i.e when the application has no permisison to write to a folder, when the code is trying to save the image in the same file it is in reading from, etc but none of those scenarios is our case. p  pWhen we realied the method was failing, we had just released a new version of our application, so we initially thought the error could be in our code despite that part had not been changed, we thought we had changed something else that was interfering and producing the error, but the more we have investigated the less we understand when the error happens.p  pIt is also important to mention that at the same time the error appeared, we also updated our servers with the latest windows updates, where I see also two suspicious onesp  pKB2929755  a hrefhttpsupport.microsoft.comkb2929755enus relnofollowhttpsupport.microsoft.comkb2929755enusabr strongOut of memory when you load some image resources in a Windows applicationstrongp  pKB2957503  a hrefhttpsupport.microsoft.comkb2957503enus relnofollowhttpsupport.microsoft.comkb2957503enusabr MS14036 Description of the security update for Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2008, Windows Vista, and Windows Server 2003 June 10, 2014br strongThis ones updates the GDIplus.dll on the server to avoid some security issues.strongp  pMy feeling is that something on the server is not being released, like if some piece of code were leaking handlers or memory,  and at some point the server runs out of them and can no longer save the Bitmap. When the error appears, any call to Bitmap.Save from any part of the application raises that exception.

This tool creates a new process for every conversion and killing it when finished, and supposedly releasing all the resources used in a proper way. p  pstrongIs someone exeperiencing any similar issuesstrongp  pstrongHas someone had any issues with the Windows updates describedstrong p  pI forgot to mention also that we tried resizing the images using WPF APIs, instead of GDI but we were facing the same problem, after several hours the server started raising an error although this time the message was Excepcin de HRESULT 0x88982F8A, so we reverted it back to our original code.p  pAny help would be appreciatedp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pActually, the code that peforms the image resizing and saving is the following.

I have two optionsp  pstrongOption 1  Upfront provisioningstrong As part of my provisioning process I could create both the queue and the table via the likes of a powershell script.

Instead it requires manual intervention. li ul  pstrongOption 2  Ondemandstrongp  pAt runtime, as resources are needed, they are created if they dont exist.p  pProsp  ul liThe running service can create whatever it needs, and as such will be more robust and require less intervention.li ul  pConsp  ul liThe code now has elevated privileges that could cause some security concernsli ul  hr  pI find myself facing this issue, mostly when dealing with queues or topicssubscriptions.

Negative 30 pthis is a component for a class assignment so I apologize if I cannot go in depth as I need to. p  pTo summarize, I need to write a python function that groups all identical files meaning files with identical content that have varying file names. The purpose of grouping them is to eventually create a dictionary of type string list where the list is the group of identical files and the key string is simply the first entry in the group when sorted in alphabetical order. We are given a directory of files. p  pSo far, I have a program that iterates through each file using glob and I am also using filecmp.cmpfile1,file2 to find identical files. What I am struggling with is the logic required to successfully compare what can be up to 1000 files. Im sure there is a more pythonic way to do this task rather than compare file1 to file2, file1 to file3, etc.p  pIn conclusion, I know how to iterate through the list of files and I know how to create a dictionary once I have my groups of identical files... Im just a bit lost on how to efficiently get the groups of files. p  pSample Implementation Have 7 files A, AA, AAA, B, BB, C, D. Files A, AA, and AAA are the same and B and BB are the same while C and D are unique. My final dictionary should be p  pA [A, AA, AAA], B [B, BB], C [C], D [D]p  pThanks in advance for your timep

Negative 30 pVHDL2008 introduced reduction operators that take in a 1D array of logic elements and output a single bit value.

Unary operators   have the same  precedence as the miscellaneous operators , ABS, and   NOT.p blockquote  pThe mechanics are explained in the LRM [9.2.2], but what motivates this question is Note 2 from [9.1]p  blockquote   pNOTE 2The syntax for an expression involving a unary condition   operator or unary logical operator in combination with any other   operator strongrequires that the unary operator and its operand be a   parenthesized expressionstrong.

Negative 30 pFor anything involving width units in CSS, Ive always used strongpxstrong when I need fixed widths and strongemstrong when I need widths relative to the size of the font.p  pThen I realized strongemstrong really is a measurement of the emheightem of the font, not the emwidthem.  Thus strongchstrong seems much more appropriate.p  pIgnoring that strongchstrong is a relatively new CSS unit older browsers may not support it, when specifying any horizontal length that should scale with the size of the font, is it best to use strongchstrong, strongemstrong, or something elsep

Negative 30 pI have a bunch of rather verbose xml files that are named in a certain way like verbosefile.xml. I have a pair of python scripts that transform these xml files into a compact json format and vice versa. Currently my workflow is that I first convert the verbose xml file into a compact json file using my script, make changes or edits to that file, and then convert the compact json version back to the verbose xml format. I wanted this process to happen transparently whenever I visitopen a file in emacs. Basically, my new workflow should be that upon opening the verbose xml files directly from the editor, I should see the compact json representation, and upon writing the file, the json should be converted behind the scenes to the verbose xml format and written. Some hints on how to do this would be great. I am new to elisp and the emacs hooksfunctions, even if I have been using the editor for some time.p  pEDIT I can change the python scripts to make things easier. For example, if the scripts working on std input makes the problem easier to solve, I can do that.p

Negative 30 pIn both the sitesavailable and sitesenabled folders, I have a conf file called zendframework.conf.  This is what I have contained in the file.p  precode ltVirtualHost 80gt       The ServerName directive sets the request scheme, hostname and port that       the server uses to identify itself. This is used when creating       redirection URLs. In the context of virtual hosts, the ServerName       specifies what hostname must appear in the requests Host header to       match this virtual host. For the default virtual host this file this       value is not decisive as it is used as a last resort host regardless.       However, you must set it for any further virtual host explicitly.

Negative 30 pIve some square images like 1024x1024 in my app and I want to show them using a PageViewController.  I want to show them in fullscreen, centering the image so the left and right borders are cut, adapting in height. Doing that using constraints works correctly when I slide from left to right. The problem appear when I slide from right to left.. I see the previous image overlapping the new one.p  pI was thinking that the solution could be something like a View to mask the imageview, but Im not able to do it. Am I totally wrong or there is a way The other solution could be cut the square image in a rectangle and show it but it slow down the viewing procedure. Bad solution I think.p  pThanks Alep  pstrongEDITstrongp  pIve solved ticking Clip Subviews on the UIView that contains the UIImageView. Greatp

Negative 30 pI am struggling with a character parenting on moving platforms in 2D game.p  pIm using OnTriggerEnter2D for a detection when player steps on the moving platform.

With common moving platforms leftright everything works fine, if a character stands on that platform he moves parallel with it, he can walk, jump etc. The problem appears when I use the platform that hangs on two ropes connected with HingeJoint2Ds. The player should swing that platform by walking left and right. When using a keyboard input everything works fine but with a touchinput controller, when player doesnt move, the character remains on one place and doesnt move with that platform. In a hierarchy panel is everything correct, player is a child of platform and the platform is moving but character isnt.p  pFor moving character Im using this part of character controllerp  precodefloat move  Input.GetAxis Horizontal rigidbody2D.velocity  new Vector2 move  maxSpeed, rigidbody2D.velocity.y codepre  pThats the same for keyboard and touch input.

Negative 30 pIn Socket.io for Node, I am a little confused how the number of clients are being tracked.  In the demo offered by Socket.io, they have a global variable numUsers in their server.js and when a new client connects, client.js communicates with server.js and numUsers increments.  However, how does numUsers keep track of the number of clients, even though its value is not stored in a database  When every unique user goes on the website, are the socket connections directed to one server, where they all can see the value of numUsers, instead of numUsers being set to 0 for every user going to the website  Thank you.p

I can add new fluid divs that have resize handles, move updown, and showhide controls, but when I close the file, the next time I open it those controls are missing. p  pI read on another site that theres just no way to get them back. The discussion on that site claimed that after those controls disappear you have to change the code manually calculate your own percentages, clear floats, etc.. Is this true There must be a way to get the controls back ...or at least I really hope there is p  pThanks  isap

Negative 30 pIm trying to write a propositional logic solver in Haskell. Im representing logical expressions with a recursive data type called Sentence that has several subtypes for different operations  AndSentence, OrSentence, etc. So I guess its a tree with several types of node each having 0, 1, or 2 children.p  pIt seems to be working but some of the code is kind of repetitive and I think there ought to be a better way to express it.

I am sure this is a somewhat common problem, so I am just wondering what the best approach is. p  pI would prefer the handler to open BOTH containers on click, and all my functions as you can see I am opening an editor on the div to edit the same copy of the div, so if a user shrinks their screen and the screen conformation toggles, the editor remains open, and their edits are preserved.  p  pnote Building the div in jQuery is not an option because the div is rather complex I eliminated a lot for brevity.p  pIs there a way to clone the div so its behavior matches the other divp  pMy openEditor function only allows one editor to be open at a time, by using .hide on all previously open editors, but I suspect there is a way to trick this into thinking they are the same editorp  pIs there a way to build one div and move it between its two locations using a windowWidth functionp  pSincere thanks for any help. It is greatly appreciated. p

Negative 30 pI know that there is the codeQueueTriggercode stuff that gets invoked when a new message is available in the queue. However, this Framework style WebJobs make it complicated for me to initialize my environment correctly.p  pThis is why I want to poll the queue myself, the basic pattern is like thisp  precodevar account  CloudStorageAccount.ParseconnectionString var client  account.CreateCloudQueueClient   Per application initialization stuff goes here  whiletrue      var queue  client.GetQueueReferencemyqueue     var message  queue.GetMessage      if message  null           Per message initialization stuff goes here          Handle message          queue.DeleteMessagemessage          else          Thread.Sleep10000  Or some exponential backoff algorithm       codepre  pstrongMy question is, are there potential problems with this approach when running continuously in a WebJob If so, what are possible alternatives to avoid frameworkstyle WebJobsstrongp  pemEditem p  pAs requested by Victor, here is some more information about why I dont want to use the codeQueueTriggercode approach. There are basically two reasons. p  pstrongThe firststrong is already mentioned above, its the fact that the framework calls a method with the codeQueueTriggercode attribute. This means that I have to put all initialization in that method. p  pWe have a twostage IoC container perapplication and perrequest in our web apps, and  I want to keep the WebJobs as close to the web apps as possible, so Id like to use that twostage IoC in the WebJobs, too the perapplication IoC does some heavy initialization that is then reused across all requests. The consequence of this would be that I have to put the perapplication container in a static variable or singleton, so that I can access it from the static codeQueueTriggercode method. This is a design quirk Im not willing to make IMO, Microsoft does this much too much, e.g. codeThread.CurrentCulturecode or codeHttpContext.Currentcode  thats REALLY an antipattern and hurts testability.p  pThe perfect WebJobs SDK for the situation described above would make the infrastructure backoff timer, poisonhandling, etc. available as service, so that the main control flow always remains with the application. This may or may not be possible for all features of the SDK, I dont know the SDK well enough to judge that.p  pstrongThe secondstrong reason is developer convenience. We have a distributed team that sometimes works in offline environments. From what Ive read a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma22723926219187herea and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma25873236219187herea, there is no possibility to run the WebJob application locally with the storage emulator and have it dequeue messages. With the selfpolling approach that Im taking now, this works like a charm.p

Here is my code so far...p  precodeSub RemoveUnecessaryData1  Dim ALLCs As Worksheet Dim DS As Worksheet Dim Dailystring As String Dim Blank As String Dim finaldate As Date   Dailystring    Daily Blank    Set DS  SheetsData Summary Set ALLCs  SheetsAsset LLC Input        ALLCs.Select         For y  1 To 40            If InStr1, Allcs.Cells13, y, Timestamp of Execution Then                 finaldate  Allcs.Cells50, y             End If         Next      ALLCs.Select         For u  1 To 40             If InStr1, Allcs.Cells13, u, Start Date Then                 For p  2 To 69584                 If allcs.Cellsp  14, u gt finaldate Then                 allcs.Cellsp  14, u.EntireRow.Delete                 End If                 Next             End If         Next codepre  pI think the main issue herein lies that finaldate is being transforming into that odd time. Any ideasp  pAlso for reference the cell its pulling from 50,y readsp  p1122015.p  pEDIT I updated my code to reflect freemans commented suggestion on the placement of my finaldate when trying to assign it a value.

Negative 30 pI am trying to achieve that certain objects within my application can only be constructed as sharedptrs by a call to a static method called create. p  pOf course I could do this by directly adding the static create method to all the respective class. However, this would mean I have to repeat very similar code in almost all my classes. A macro would work, but I do not find this very elegant.p  pI came up with an alternative way of doing this by deriving all classes from a templated BaseObject class that implements the create method and returns the pointer. This almost works, except that stdmakeshared cannot access the constructor of its child class when it is protected. p  pThe nonsolution would be to make the child class constructor public see 1 in the example below. But now Foo can be normally constructed again and this would defeat the entire point. An alternative solution would be to friend BaseObject in the child class and make use of sharedptr directly see 2 in the example. p  pBoth solutions put extra burden on the implementer of the child class. Since they have to either find an alternative way of making the constructor nonpublic or put a friend declaration. The 2 solution has the additional problem of not being able to use the more efficient makeshared.p  pMy question is there a better way of doing thisp  precodetemplateltclass Tgt class BaseObject  public     typedef stdsharedptrltTgt SharedPtr      templateltclass...

This is to be done by rotating the test pattern image around x and y by the negative values of alpha and beta. So how to get the homography matrix only for rotation. I have gone through a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6606891opencvvirtuallycamerarotatingtranslatingforbirdseyeview66677846667784virtual camera rotationa and the a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiHomographycomputervision relnofollowwiki linka. The virtual camera rotation code produces good result but is dependent on distance of the camera from the test pattern which in my case is unknown. I tried codecvwarpPerspectivecode by passing only the rotation matrix but results were weird. p

Negative 30 pIm trying to solve the following problem Given a sorted increasing order array with unique integer elements, write an algorithm to create a BST with minimal height.p  pThe given answer takes the root node to be the middle of the array. While doing this makes sense to me intuitively, Im trying to prove, rigorously, that its always best to make the root node the middle of the array. p  pThe justification given in the book is To create a tree of minimal height, we need to match the number of nodes in the left subtree to the number of nodes in the right subtree as much as possible. This means that we want the root node to be the middle of the array, since this would mean that half the elements would be less than the root and half would be greater.p  pId like to askp  ol lipWhy would any tree of minimal height be one where the number of nodes in the left subtree be as equal as possible to the number of nodes in the right subtree Or, do you have any other way to prove that its best to make the root node the middle of the arraypli lipIs a tree with minimal height the same as a tree thats balanced From a previous question on SO, thats the impression I got, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions29324245visualizingabalancedtree2932430429324304Visualizing a balanced treea but Im confused because the book specifically states BST with minimal height and never balanced BST.pli ol  pThanks.p  pSource Cracking the Coding Interviewp

Negative 30 pI am just learning about WebPack module, and I am thinking of moving the entire JS infrastructure of my Django app to modules.

Negative 30 pIve been working on a Content Blocking application for some time now. I have a switch in the main app that should turn of the blocking filter. The value of this switch is saved in an NSUserDefaults property thats enabled with App Groups so the blocking extension can read whether its enabled or not if blocking is enabled it returns a full json list and if not it returns an empty one.p  pOn Simulator this works just fine, but when I start running it on a device tested on 5s and 5c the extension cant read the properties from the UserDefaults anymore it always returns nil and the application cant read the properties from the extension anymore.p  pI think it has something to do with the App Groups, but I cant seem to find any problems with that its enabled in Capibilities etc. so Im a bit lost.

Negative 30 pWe have a Rails app with a PostgreSQL database. We use codegitcode for version control.p  pWere only two developers on the project, so we both have to do a little of everything, and when emergencies arise we often have to drop everything to address them.p  pWe have a main branch called codestagingcode just to be difficult  which we only use directly for quick fixes, minor copy changes, etc. For bigger features, we work on independent feature branches.p  pWhen I work on a feature that requires changes to the database, I naturally have to create migrations that alter the schema. Lets say Im working on codefeatureemojicode, and I create a migration code20150706101741addemojitousers.rbcode. I run coderake dbmigratecode to get on with my work.p  pLater, Im informed of some bug I need to address. I switch to codestagingcode to start work on it however, now my app will misbehave because the db schema does not match what the app expects. So embeforeem doing codegit checkout stagingcode, I have to remember to do coderake dbrollbackcode. And then later when I switch back to codefeatureemojicode, I have to run coderake dbmigratecode again.p  pThis whole flow is sort of okayish when dealing with just two branches, but when the codegit rebasecodes and codegit mergecodes happen, it gets complicated.p  pIs there no better way to handle versioning of code and db in parallel Or am I doomed to have to run annoying coderakecode tasks every time I want to change branchesp

Negative 30 pTo begin with my question will probably spark a zillion opinions, and I am sure that what I am looking for can be implemented in a number of ways. p  pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pSites like Google and Facebook push out new features to their users, sometimes a small number of users and sometimes they push new features to the entire public. Rolling out new site functionalities and features is probably what many websites do, including the mentioned ones here.  p  pstrongIn my casestrong p  pI have a menu that is accessible by every user on the site, any time. This means it acts a little bit like the Start Menu in Windows in a very familiar way. Now, this menu of mine is drawn upon request by some PHP code. Currently I have a multidimensional array which holds all the menu items and links for navigation. The idea is that once in a while when a new feature is shipped, Id add it to my multidimensional array which will be generated by the database later, and the PHP code will render it in the menu as a new item with NEW highlight mark. p  pstrongMy main questionstrong p  pIs the approach of using a database table a good way of enablingdisabling and rolling out new features to your users p  pExample of what I want to achieve p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comDv5uU.png altenter image description herep  pstrongBounty I am GIVING AWAY 50 of my REPUTATION POINTS TO GET A GOOD ANSWER TO MY QUESTION.

Negative 30 pIm trying to set up animating in a list of items in React. Im using Velocity for the animations, and using codereactaddonscodes codeTransitionGroupcode. The easy part is using the index of the item in the list to stagger them in, but theres a problem when I load additional data from the server, and add them to the list the index of the new items are from 20 to [x], so they wait 20  300ms before the first one animates in. Given a number, say 23, is there an easy way to boil this down to 3 remove 20 in this case, if the number were 55, boil it down to 5. This should be really basic, but I cant get my head around an elegant solution. Any help would be greatly appreciatedp

Negative 30 pIm working on revising an old Java GUI to python and have decided to try to create and implement this in PyQt4.p  pThe original program connects to an outside server and uses the data set by the server to update various figures. These figures are opened from a main GUI and operate and update independently of each other. p  pI have managed to set something similar up that opens a main GUI window, and connects to an outside server. Where I am having an issue is updating a figure when I get new data from the server I figured Id start with one figure then increase from there.p  pDue to my lack of understanding, or python documentation found, on setting up a client to server connection or threading in the GUI through PyQt I have implemented various work arounds. I connect to the server and read in data via a twisted client. This client is run on a separate thread implemented from the python threading module. This at least from what I can tell works. p  pI can open up the figures with the newly updated data from the main window but I can not seem to update them from the twisted client thread. I get errors likep  pQObjectsetParent Cannot set parent, new parent is in a different thread or  exceptions.RuntimeError main thread is not in main loopp  pFrom my research I understand that for PyQt windows must be updated from the main thread. I am not sure how to do this. My current implementation has the main thread carrying the main initial window and I am unsure of how to trigger it to update the child windows when new data is received.p  pAny ideas or links that might give me either an idea how to implement this or what could be a better framework or setup of the GUI  p  pstrongEDITstrong The current set up of my code creates the thread that sets up the client connection and processes the server messages is currently set to a Daemon thread. Since, it does not have an exit condition unless the connection to the server is lost. The Twisted client does not allow the user to return data but since the data I need to update the figures is stored inside of the self variable they are updated during each new data packet. All examples of QTread seem to have an exit condition how would I get it to work without one Or how do I set up my client side to have an exit statement and then reconnect to get the next messagep

I have updated the javascript codes and is now looping back to 0. The problem that I cant solve now is that when b is equal to 16, a should reset to 0 so that it would show the first 4 items again. But the problem is that when I click the button again after the last value in the array, it does not go back to 0 but instead shows an undefined 17,18,19. When I click again, the items 0,1,2 and 3 are skipped and the program jumps to 4,5,6,7 immediately. As of the moment Im still trying to figure it out. Any help would be much appreciated.p  p3rd UPDATE Is anyone seeing this Ive inserted a few lines in. Its a new button wherein it will show the previous 4 items. Its working fine except if Im at the first four items. When I click the button, negative number comes up. I want it to get to 1215 but my head is spinning on how to come up with that logic. any helpp
Negative 30 pYea, worst title ever, I know.  I have some blog apps that use Wordpress.  I parse the XML feed from wordpress, and create a codeTableViewcode from this data, each row an article.  At first, I had it push a new view controller that contained a codeUIWebViewcode that would load the codeltlinkgtcode tag of that XML entry.  p  pI began getting rejected by Apple, as the app was not different enough from a Safari experience, due to it loading the same URL as the article would load in Safari.p  pTo combat this, I took the entire article from the XML, and embed it within a custom HTML String I had written, and store that as a property, and have the web view load that HTML.p  pThis works fine, and I can customize very easily the way the article reads, and it doesnt look just like Safari, so Apple approves the apps.  The issue is that those that read the article in the app never get counted towards the stats of views on wordpress.  Is there any way you can think of that I can increase the stats without actually going to the link for wordpressp

Negative 30 pI am doing a project on particle dynamics and I started by letting a particle a sphere fall from a certain height towards a fixed particle in the ground. p  pInside a do loop a time loop, from the initial time to a certain time elapsed with a certain timestep, I use an Eulers method to integrate the positions and velocities, and also calculate the forces gravitational and elastic and the collision conditions as well. p  pThis model will later be generalized for 3, 4, ..., n particles in the scale of hundreds of thousands, and so I am using arrays to punctuate the particles which positions and velocities as time goes by I am integrating. That way, I also put a do loop inside the time loop  for each particle  from 1 to N the number of particles, and define N as 2 since in this case alone I have only two particles. This is the segmentation fault, since I tell it to calculate 3 things when I only specified that I have two.p  pWhilst trying to fix it, when I define the parameters for i and i1, when i2, i1  21  3 will be calculated  but I do not have a third particle. In a similar way, if I put i1 and i instead, for i  1 where the loop starts, i1  0, but that doesnt make sense, since I do not have a 0th particle. In another attempt, if I change the loop from 1,N to 1,N1, since N1, it wont calculate for N2. Also, I have thought about printing my results in twos, that is, for particles 1 and 2, 2 and 3, 3 and 4, and so on... calculating i AND i1 simultaneously for each integration, making the run time longer  which will cost me a lot of time later, since these simulations for a big number of particles can take weeks. But if I state that in files, it will repeat the file creation for all particles, except for the first and the last even more time wasted. How can I run it only considering the first and two particles, generalizing for any number of particles that I choose p  precodedo t  tmin, tmax, dt     do i  1,N         call contact xoldi, xoldi1, ri, ri1         call forces mi,  g, k, ri, ri1, xoldi, xoldi1         call eulerxoldi, xnewi, voldi, vnewi, dt, Fi, mi         writei, , t, t, x, xoldi, v, voldi, dx, dx, force, Fi     end do end do codepre

It just gives information about what it is, and what it does, I seen on another site that the snippet of code they have like the one below is custom, and has their domain  a unique id in it.p  pI was wondering how can I get my own code for my website I cant find any page where cloudflare will give me the code, or tell me how to implement it into my website, do I just copy the code from another website I dont think I do as each code has the websites domain and a unique id...p  precodeltscript typetextjavascriptgt lt[CDATA[ tryif window.CloudFlare var CloudFlare[verbose0,p0,byc0,owlidcf,bag21,mirage20,oracle0,pathscloudflarecdncginexpdok3v1613a3a185,atok0c520450ae00f93ad3c6d427e6175e11,petok39b2bad3263429bff6b9dfc54bc4b070f517b5df14439203791800,zonefabborp.co.uk,rocketa,apps0]document.writeltscript typetextjavascript srcajax.cloudflare.comcdncginexpdok3ve9627cd26acloudflare.min.jsgtltscriptgtcatche ]]gt ltscriptgt ltscript typetextrocketscriptgt lt[CDATA[ tryif window.CloudFlare var CloudFlare[verbose0,p0,byc0,owlidcf,bag21,mirage20,oracle0,pathscloudflarecdncginexpdok3v1613a3a185,atokcc7792bcd37b11acfe5d52854c3c31cb,petok60a72fe01a43af4ce7bfedbb9aa1557bd41221e914377545061800,betokb5597544ec58644c04609e45c7005743deab17c51437754506120,zonefabborp.co.uk,rocketa,apps0]document.writeltscript typetextjavascript srcajax.cloudflare.comcdncginexpdok3ve6ea9bd6c9cloudflare.min.jsgtltscriptgtcatche ]]gt ltscriptgt codepre  pMain question is, how do I get my OWN code for rocketshare..p
