Negative 3988 pa little background info first. I have been using Web Forms for most of my career and have recently become interested in .NET MVC. I realize that it is intended to be stateless, however, i dont understand how it is completely feasible. In a forms application, the user authenticates and I return a user ID and some roles which are then placed in that users session. When I need them, all I have to do is pull it out of session and I have it. From what I have read, session and MVC are mutually exclusive. Ive read that one can use TempData  to pass values but it only persists for one page visit and then its gone. Is there a standard way that data can be persisted on an MVC site other than adding redundant code to every controller where i want to pass the data  Thanks in advance for any help p

Negative 3988 pSo I have two sortable lists in a web app Im writing. What I want to do is make one of the lists not be reorderable, but allow its items to be dragged onto the other list. Items from list one can be dropped on list two, but items on list one cant be rearranged.p  pAnother thing I want to do is to make it so when items are dragged off of list one theyre not removed from list one the dragged item is only dragging a copy.p  pThe end goal is to have a toolbox thing that allows the user to drag elements into a canvas of sorts. Elements in the toolbox arent rearrangement and once theyre dragged off the dont go away so the user is just dragging copies.p  pHelp with either disabling reordering or making copies dragged off would be much appreciatedp  pI can post my list code if you guys need itp
Negative 3988 pI have a fairly large report Im trying to create as an RDLC in Visual Studio 2008. There are several sections that I plan to create as subreports and then compile them all into a master RDLC. However, one of my clients requirements is that it have a table of contents with page numbers indicating where to find the various sections of the report. I have yet to find a way to construct a table of contents that will dynamically pull page numbers from the various sections of the report. And Im not sure how it could be done programmatically because you dont have page number information until you generate the report, at which point it seems you would have to come up with a solution that is implemented internal to the RDLC.p
Negative 3988 pWeve inherited a rather large Access DB that has some very strange and unsettling behaviour Some updates to the database are lost. What can we do to avoid this Are there any settings in Access to provide better transactional controlp  pHere are some more detailsp  ul liWe have one access user that has write access shared by a very limited number of users  currently only me as the others are on vacation.li liWe have another access user that is used by many people that only has read access.li liSome changes to the data are made by the write user. li liAfter leaving and reentering the table andor even the application, the changes seem to have been committed.li liAfter a while usually overnight the changes are lost and the data is back to the old values.li ul  pWhat can cause this behaviorp  pOur theory is that this is caused by some weird transactional control within Access. The readonly user gets some kind of exclusive lock to the data that is used within a query or form. Once the user leaves that queryform, Access makes sure that this is still in the database. If in the meantime the write user has changed the data, these changes will be reverted when the read only user leaves the queryform, resulting in a lost update. Does this make sense Is this a known issue with MSAccessp  pAlso, were interested how we can avoid this issue. Is this something that is inherent in Access and can only be avoided by switching to a real database with better transactional control From a technical viewpoint, that would be nice but of course it would be an urgent todo that we would rather avoid at this point in the project.p  pThanks for any input and let me know if there is extra information that is required.p

Negative 3988 pIf youre doing minmaxavg queries, do you prefer to use aggregation tables or simply query across a range of rows in the raw tablep  pThis is obviously a very openended question and theres no one right answer, so Im just looking for peoples general suggestions. Assume that the raw data table consists of a timestamp, a numeric foreign key say a user id, and a decimal value say a purchase amount. Furthermore, assume that there are millions of rows in the table.p  pI have done both and am torn. On one hand aggregation tables have given me significantly faster queries but at the cost of a proliferation of additional tables. Displaying the current values for an aggregated range either requires dropping entirely back to the raw data table or combining more fine grained aggregations. I have found that keeping track in the application code of which aggregation table to query when is more work that youd think and that schema changes will be required, as the original aggregation ranges will invariably not be enough But I wanted to see our sales over the last 3 pay periods.p  pOn the other hand, querying from the raw data can be punishingly slow but lets me be very flexible about the data ranges. When the range bounds change, I simply change a query rather than having to rebuild aggregation tables. Likewise the application code requires fewer updates.  I suspect that if I was smarter about my indexing i.e. always having good covering indexes, I would be able to reduce the penalty of selecting from the raw data but thats by no means a panacea.p  pIs there anyway I can have the best of both worldsp

Negative 3988 pIm working in a WPF project, Im using the MVVM patter in my project.p  pI created a user control also in WPF and I want to use it in my project, now, my problem is that I have a method in my user control that I need to call from my View Model, but I dont know how to do that, how to bind to the method inside my control from the view model.p  pIf I use code behind, obviously there is no problem since I have a direct reference to my control, so I can do mycontrol.MyMethodm, but of course, doing in this way will go against the logic of the MVVM pattern.p  pI tried to use a Dependency Property in my user control, and use that Dependency Property to bind to it in the xaml of my project but it didnt worked, the compiler says that the property was not found or is not serializable.p  pSo I will appreciate if someone can share some light about how can I accomplish this.p  pstrongEditedstrongp  pAs far as I understand you have the view, which is all the GUI, then you have the model, which is all the logic, and them you have the viewmodel which is like an intermediate layer used to bind the view with the model, rightp  pIn this way I have developed my project, however I came to the problem that I need a custom control, a TextBox that remember what the user entered, and when he start typing, if there are words that start with that letter, those words are shown as a suggestion, as Google does it.p  pThis TextBox is used as a search filter so I created a user control to do this, I added a method to my user control to allow whatever application that uses my control to add items to an internal array that holds all the strings that the user has entered.p  pI created a user control because I couldnt find any control that behaves the way I want.p  pSo my problem is when I add my user control to the main project, because I need to someway be able to call the method that add the items to the internal array, but maybe Im doing things the wrong way, so if any of you has a better idea, I will appreciate if you shared it with me.p

Negative 3988 pI wish to have two classes, a server class and a client class.  The server class should recieve the IP address and Port number of each new client and store them in a list.  It should supply each of the clients with a list of connected clients and their IP addresses.  The clients could then communicate with each other using TCP connections.p  pThe catch is that the clients wont know what the IP address of the server is.  The entire program will however run on a local area network.  My guess is that it needs some sort of UDP broadcast, but every time I try to impliment this it doesnt work unless the two instances of the program are running on the same computer.p  pThe application would be installed by clients with limited computing knowledge so it should just be a case of installing the program on all the computers and plugging in to the network.p  pIf anyone has a reliable, clear implimentation of this using C.net 3.5 or earlier it would be much appreciated.p

Negative 3988 pI am attempting to test the codeIndexcode action of a controller.

While this works I am concerned about the best way to test the results that I am receiving from the codeIndexcode action.p  pThe controllers index action looks like thisp  precodepublic ActionResult Index      TestCustomerForm cust  Mapper.MapltCustomer,         TestCustomerFormgtrepository.GetCustomerByLoginCurrentUserLoginName      return Viewcust  codepre  pAnd its codeTestMethodcode looks like thisp  precode[TestMethod] public void IndexShouldReturnCustomerWithMachines       arrange     var customer  SetupCustomerForRepository  gets a boiler plate customer     var testController  CreateTestController       act     ViewResult result  testController.Index as ViewResult       assert     Assert.AreEqualcustomer.MachineList.Count,         result.ViewData.Model as TestCustomerForm.MachineList.Count  codepre  pIn the codeCreateTestControllercode method I use codeRhino.Mockscode to mock a customer repository and set it up to return the customer from codeSetupCustomerForRepositorycode.

Negative 3988 pI have a Data Access Layer, a Service Layer, and a Presentation Layer. The Presentation Layer is ASP.NET MVC2 RTM web, and the Service Layer is WCF services. Its all .NET 3.5 SP1.p  pThe problem is that in the services, the objects being returned are marked with the code[DataContract]code attribute. The web is using the AppFabric Cache a.k.a Velocity SessionStateProvider to store session state. Due to this, anything I store in the session must be serializable. p  pHere comes the problem the DataContracts arent marked with code[Serializable]code and as far as I can remember, by introducing it onto a class already marked with code[DataContract]code some issues arise, and so I dont believe this is a solution.p  pI was initially planning on using the DataContracts right in the web layer, using them as models to views related to rendering the DataContracts probably nested inside a higher level ViewModel class. But due to the session state provider requiring all objects stored inside it to be serializable, Im starting to rethink this strategy. It would be nice to have though, since they contain validation logic using the codeIDataErrorInfocode interface, and the same validation logic could be reused in MVC as part of model binding.p  pWhat do you believe is the best way to allow me to reduce the work neededp  pIve currently thought of the following different waysp  pstrongA. Create a ServiceIntegration part in the web project.strongp  pThis would be a middle man between my controllers and my WCF service layer. The ServiceIntegration part would speak to the service layer using DataContracts, and to the Web layer using ViewModels, but would have to transform between the DataContracts and ViewModels using a twoway Transformer.p  pAlso, since the IDataErrorInfo Validation wouldnt be reusable, it would be necessary to create a Validator per DataContract too, that uses the Transformer to convert from ViewModel to DataContract, perform validation using IDataErrorInfo and return its results. This would then be used inside action methods of Controllers e.g. codeif MyValidator.IsValidviewModel return Viewcodep  pemDifferent classes required xDataContract, xViewModel, xTransformer, xValidatoremp  pstrongB. Create a SessionIntegration part in the web projectstrongp  pThis would be a middleman between the controllers or anything accessing the session and the session itself. Anything requiring access to the session would go through this class. DataContracts would be used in the entire application, unless they are being stored into the session. The SessionIntegration part would take the responsibility of transforming the DataContract to some ISerializable form, and back. No additional Validator is needed because of the use of of IDataErrorInfo interface on the DataContract.p  pemDifferent classes required xDataContract, xTransformer, xSerializableFormemp  hr  pNote there would still be ViewModels around in both scenarios, however with B Id be able to compose ViewModels from DataContracts.p  pB has the benefit of not needing an extra validator.p  hr  pBefore I go off and implement AB fully, Id like some feedback. At the moment, Im starting to lean towards B, however, A might be more flexible. Either way, it seems like way too much work for what its worth.

Negative 3988 pMy two questions arep  ul liCan I use clustered indexes to speed up bulk inserts in big tablesli liCan I then still efficiently use foreign key relationships if my IDENTITY column is not the clustered index anymoreli ul  pTo elaborate, I have a database with a couple of very big between 1001000 mln rows tables containing company data. Typically there is data about 2040 companies in such a table, each as their own chunk marked by CompanyIdentifier INT. Also, every company has about 20 departments, each with their own subchunk marked by DepartmentIdentifier INT.p  pIt frequently happens that a whole chunk or subchunk is added or removed from the table. My first thought was to use Table Partitioning on those chunks, but since I am using SQL Server 2008 Standard Edition I am not entitled to it. Still, most queries I have are executed on a chunk or subchunk rather than on the table as a whole.p  pI have been working to optimize these tables for the following functionsp  ol liQueries that are run on subchunksli liBenchmarking queries that are run on the table as a wholeli liInsertingremoving big chunks of data.li ol  pFor 1 and 2 I havent encountered a lot of problems. I have created several indexes on key fields also containing CompanyIdentifier and DepartmentIdentifier where useful and the queries are running fine. p  pBut for 3 I have struggled to find a good solution.  My first strategy was to always disable indexes, bulk insert a big chunk and rebuild indexes. This was very fast in the beginning, but now that there are a lot of companies in the database, it takes a very long time to rebuild the index each time.p  pAt the moment my strategy has changed to just leaving the index on while inserting, since this seems to be faster now. But I want to optimize the insert speed even further. p  pI seem to have noticed that by adding a clustered index defined on CompanyIdentifier  DepartmentIdentifier, the loading of new chunks into the table is faster. Before I had abandoned this strategy in favour of adding a clustered index on an IDENTITY column, as several articles pointed out to me that the clustered index is contained in all other indexes and so the clustered index should be as small as possible. But now I am thinking of reviving this old strategy to speed up the inserts. My question, would this be wise, or will I suffer performance hits in other areas And will this really speed up my inserts or is that just my imaginationp  pI am also not sure whether in my case an IDENTITY column is really needed. I would like to be able to establish foreign key relationships with other tables, but can I also use something like a CompanyIdentifierDepartmentIdentifier[uniquifier] scheme for that Or does it have to be a tablewide, fragmented IDENTITY numberp  pThanks a lot for any suggestions or explanations.p

Negative 3988 pIm making a canvasbased game engine and am wondering if anyone has any good info on how to achieve an overhead view perspective. What Im looking for is somewhere halfway between the traditional birds eye view and the old SNES mode7 view. Just a slight angle to give the illusion of 3D.p  pIm trying to figure out what is going to be the best way to deal with the perspective skewing. Im not doing rotations so 3D matrix stuff would be going overboard, but I need to be able to deal with rendering the map layers at a consistent angle and itd be nice if the angle was adjustable. I also need to deal with the depth warp. Basically, the bottom row of pixels should be 11 pixel width and height, then for each row itd get, for example, 5 smaller or something like that. What Id like is to be able to supply a large canvas as a texture and then supply a camera angle between 0 and 90 where 0 is perfectly horizontal and 90 is birds eye view.p  pAnyone have any related tutorials or sample code Ive searched online a bit, but everything Ive found seems to either be unsuitable for use in this particular application or overly complex, doing all sorts of crazy 3D skewing and rotation stuff. All I want is to take the normal tiled grid and lean it back a bit, no rotations or complicated stuff like that.p  pHeres an example of what I want img srchttpimg801.imageshack.usimg8012176perspectivesample.jpg altHeres an example.p  pThe bottom pixel row is 11 pixel ratio, and each row above that progressively gets shorter horizontally and vertically. The source texture of the top center region is normally about half the height of the bottom center region, but it has been shrunk vertically and horizontally to fit the perspective.p  pWhat Im thinking might work best is to render the current viewport state to another canvas in flat, birds eye view, with approximately 50 extra space on the top and sides, then slice an upside triangular region from that and draw that to the actual visible canvas.p  pOnly problem is, I suck at math when it comes to calculating angles and such.p

Negative 3988 pI was wondering, what are the advantages and disadvantages of strongKalman Filterstrong and strongExponential Filterstrong I have a multisensor fusion problem and Im trying to decide which method to choose.p  pI think, Kalman filter is more computationally complicated but it has a more detailed model of the system so it is more accurate in multisensor fusion.p  pWhereas the Exponential filter is a simple equation but it is limited by the choice of alpha Higher alpha  less memory of the filter and thus lesser smoothing, but more weightage on measurements whereas lower alpha has higher degree of smoothing but sudden changes are not reflected properly. p  pThe Exponential filter is more useful in noise cancellation, when there is jitter etc. whereas the Kalman filter is useful for the actual multisensor fusion. Is this correctp  pAlso, how useful is the Genetic Algorithm for sensor fusion I am trying to combine a magnetic compass and gyroscope for estimating true orientation. p  pThanksp

Negative 3988 pi have a program wherein it searches the reply from a curl request for specific strings. i sometimes get gzipped data. is there a way to find whether the reply is text or gzipped format header sometimes contain gziipped,deflate header, but its not consistent. is there a way to search the string and find if its gzippedp
Negative 3988 pIt has come to my attention that you can unittest an abstract class by instantiating it as a mock object. Thereby you mock the abstract properties and methods, while being able to test the implemented ones. p  pHowever, I am accustomed to distinguish between the class strongto teststrong and the injected dependencies strongto mockstubstrong. So, in this early stage of my new enlightenment I wonder if there are any pitfalls to this way of testing Any thoughts on this p  pRegards,  Mortenp
Negative 3988 pI am trying to get dpHibernate 2.0 RC6 running on an Apache Tomcat 7.0.12 with BlazeDS 4.0.0.14931, Spring 3.0.5 and SpringBlazeDSIntegration 1.5.0.M2 p  pI got pretty far with my configuration, the services are parsed fine, annotation based Entities and Datamodel are good, I can list the services in FlashBuilder DCD, but as soon as I am calling a service method just a simple void method the server returns following Exception. Not really sure where in my configuration I could have missed something, as I understood from the docs the rest is auto wired.p  precodeoperationgetAll invoke 6823 java.lang.IllegalArgumentException

Negative 3988 pI would like to develop a media playerrecorder. p  pThe primary target platform is Windows, support for other OSs would be nice, but thats not a high priority. It should be able to play formats like wav, mp3, avi. It should also be able to record audio microphone and video webcam or capture card.p  pAs I have some experience with QT and C, I looked at QT 4.7.2 phonon with DS backend. But unfortunately I was unable to play a simple AVI, even with the MediaPlayer sample that comes with the QT demos. I could only hear sound, but saw no video. p  pThe developer machine is a 64bit Vista. I also tried it on another 64bit Vista without any luck. On a 32bit Win7 QT MinGW it then finally worked. But when I copied that MediaPlayer executable and its dlls to the 64bit machines and tried to run it, it again failed.p  pIs there a known problem with QT phonon on 64 bit machines I also heard of a VLC phonon backend. Could that be solution Is QT phonon mature enough to develop a commercial application on top of it Or is it maybe more wise to access directshow directlyp  pThanksp
Negative 3988 pIs there a program or script that can read an image on standard input and write a resized image to standard output  without waiting for EOF on standard input Poor quality is acceptable waiting for the whole image to load is not.p  pImageMagick codeconvertcode and codestreamcode alike will read, then process, then output. What I want is more like a realtime stream processor if Im scaling down 50, it should output one row of thumbnail for every two rows of input roughly, regardless of the state of the input stream.p  pIf this doesnt make sense yet, imagine youre loading an image over a slow network connection. As soon as it can, the browser starts displaying the top edge of the image. If the image is larger than the window, the browser scales it down to fit the window. It doesnt have to wait for the whole image to load.p  pHere are some of the tools Ive used for testing. This serves an image on port 8080 in ten slices, with a onesecond delay between slices to simulate a slow network connectionp  pcodeIMAGEtest.jpg SLICES10 SIZEstat c s IMAGE BSSIZE  SLICES  1 echo HTTP1.0 200 OK echo ContentType imagejpeg echo for i in seq 0 SLICES  1 do dd ifIMAGE bsBS skipi count1 sleep 1 done  nc lp8080 q0codep  pRun that and immediately open codelocalhost8080code in your browser to see the image slowly load. If you pipe the image slices to codeconvertcode or codestreamcode instead of codenccode omitting all the echoes, no output appears for ten seconds, and then you get the whole thumbnail at once.p

Negative 3988 pIs there any good empirical data on the cost of context switching between threads of the same process on Linux x86 and x8664, mainly, are of interest Im talking about the number of cycles or nanoseconds between the last instruction one thread executes in userspace before getting put to sleep voluntarily or involuntarily, and the first instruction a different thread of the same process executes after waking up on the same cpucore.p  pI wrote a quick test program that constantly performs coderdtsccode in 2 threads assigned to the same cpucore, stores the result in a volatile variable, and compares to its sister threads corresponding volatile variable. The first time it detects a change in the sister threads value, it prints the difference, then goes back to looping. Im getting minimummedian counts of about 89009600 cycles this way on an Atom D510 cpu. Does this procedure seem reasonable, and do the numbers seem believablep  pMy goal is to estimate whether, on modern systems, threadperconnection server model could be competitive with or even outperform selecttype multiplexing. This seems plausible in theory, as the transition from performing IO on fd codeXcode to fd codeYcode involves merely going to sleep in one thread and waking up in another, rather than multiple syscalls, but its dependent on the overhead of context switching.p

Negative 3988 pIs there any useful documentation for using the HOGDescriptor functionality in Python OpenCV I have read the C documentation, but the Python version functions differently and I cannot figure it out just by tinkering. p  pMost specifically, I am seeking an OpenCV command in Python that takes an image and a pixel location as input and possibly also some parameters about the size of a detection window and then just returns a Python array that contains the HOG feature vector i.e. a list or NumPy array, etc., where the jth element of the list is the jth histogram component from a histogram of oriented gradients.p  pMy goal is to feed these histograms into the scikits.learn SVM pipelines so I can avoid the OpenCV SVM training, but to do this I need the actual feature vectors themselves and not the sort of HOG processing chain pipelines stuff that OpenCV appears to use. p  pAny other Python implementations of HOG code would work too. I need something reasonably efficient though to compare with another code base that I am writing myself.p

Negative 3988 pIn my quest to generate new code in a Scala compiler plugin, I have now created working classes. The next logical step is to put those classes in a new, nonexisting package. In Java, a package is basically a directory name, but in Scala a package seems much more complicated. So far I havent foundrecognized an example where a compiler plugin creates a new package.p  pAt my current level of understanding, I would think that I would need to create first a package symbol withp  precodeparentPackage.newPackage...  ... codepre  pand than later create a Tree for the package with PackageDef. But PackageDef doesnt take the symbol as parameter, as one would expect, and searching forp  precodeScala newPackage PackageDef codepre  preturned nothing useful. So it seems that I dont need to do those two steps together. Possibly one is done for my by the compiler, but I dont know which one. So far, what I have looks like thisp  precodeval newPkg  parentPackage.newPackageNoPosition, newTermNamename newPkg.moduleClass.setInfonew PackageClassInfoTypenew Scope,     newPkg.moduleClass newPkg.setInfonewPkg.moduleClass.tpe parentPackage.info.decls.enternewPkg  ... val newPkgTree  PackageDefIdentnewPkg.name, ListClassDef... codepre

How can we prevent this from happeningp  pThe only reason we can think of emwhyem it happens isp  ul liThe COM object is created in another STA, so were performing a crossSTA call which needs to be marshalledli licrossthread STA calls uses a Windows Message to send an RPC request to the COM componentli licrossthread STA calls use the Windows Message pump to receive RPC answerli liDuring the waiting another type of event comes in like mouse clicked, and this gets handled before the RPC answer gets handled.li liThis RPC answer gets handledli ul  pThings we tried to fix the problemp  ul liuse lock in all event handlers. This does not work since lock will lock a thread, and in this case it is the same thread which reenters the event handler.li liuse custom locking like bool locked  false if locked  locked  true InvokeMethod ... locked  false . This works partially it throws away the events instead of queuing them for later, and need an extensive change to emallem our event handlers, which is not nice to do.li liuse Dispatcher.DisableProcessing to stop other messages from being processed. This does not help it throws an exception because of messages being processed anyways.li licreate a second dispatcher in a new thread, and run ocx.InvokeMehod via Dispatcher.Invoke to have it handled by another thread. This gives An event was unable to invoke any of the subscribers Exception from HRESULT 0x80040201 Yes, were also subscribed to COM events of the ActiveX object.li liuse Dispatcher.PushFrame to stop event handling from happening. This also fails.li ul  pA wild idea which might work, but dont know how to implement this would be creating a new message pump as the WPF message pump which can be configured to temporarily handle only RPC calls. This is along the lines of a hrefhttpjmorrill.hjtcentral.comHometabid428EntryId430WPFMediaKitUpdates.aspxhttpjmorrill.hjtcentral.comHometabid428EntryId430WPFMediaKitUpdates.aspxa , but still somewhat different from this situation.p  pSo the question boils down to how can we make ActiveX call synchronously like we expected it already to be instead of asyncp  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pTo make it more clear that the mechanism involved is not only about mouseevents, but the more generic problem of a new event is handled while the old is being executed, Ill give another example with a stack tracep  pContext weve got a WPF Grid on which we get a mouseclick GridMouseDown, weve got an ActiveX object on which we perform the method CloseShelf. Opening the shelf will take time, so we are subscribed to the event EventShelfClosed, which in the event handler of EventShelfClosed will call ListShelf to know which shelfs are left.p  pThis is how the managed stack trace looks like Hans asked for an unmanaged stacktrace, but I dont know how to get onep  precodeMyAxWrapper.dllMyAxWrapper.MyAxWrapper.InvokeMemberstring methodName,

CloseShelf is so fast that the event EventShelfClosed is emitted and handled emduringem the call to CloseShelf. Now CloseShelf will call ListShelfs, but ListShelfs will fail and return null because the ActiveX component is locked by the CloseShelf call which is still active.p  pWhy is this a problem Becasue the programmer does not expect a method call to be async. This hit us after creating a large program, which now means auditting all calls for unexpected behaviour.p  pWhat would we like to see in this case We would like to see that CloseShelf returns without handling other events during the call. The method should be synchronous, and any pending events handled during the main nonrecursive message loop.p  pHaving a lock kind of boolean wont help here, since we would be missing events here, which locks up the application.p

Negative 3988 pemFor the .NET DateTime type, why is the inferred database type SqlDbTypes.DateTime instead of SqlDbTypes.DateTime2em See a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryyy6y35y8.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryyy6y35y8.aspxap  h2Backgroundh2  pBy defaulting to the lessprecise SQL DateTime type, the .NET framework guarantees that, by default, any .NET DateTime value you pass through an SqlParameter object with an unspecified SqlDbType is sure to be strongemcorrupted via a reduction in precisionemstrong.  Thats a bad design decision, IMO, considering there would be no worse consequences by simply preserving the full value.p  pFor example, I cannot use SqlParameterCollection.AddWithValue method, because when passing a DateTime value, the value is truncated to an SQL DateTime value which has a very limited range.  The results are eitherp  ul li.NET DateTime value is outside the allowed range of an SQL DateTime value, and an error occurs, orli liThe truncated value will not match the more precise value in the database and it will not properly match records for update operations, which is even worse, IMO, because its subtle and doesnt generate an error.li ul  h2Questionh2  pstrongSince the .NET DateTime corresponds most closely to the SQL Server 2008 data type datetime27 in both precision and range, why does the framework convert an SqlParameter value to an SQL DateTime, and is there any way to change the default behavior so I can still use the typeinference featurestrongp  pThe only advice I can see is that the feature is broken and I a hrefhttpgeekswithblogs.netRhamesarchive20081029whyyoushouldalwaysspecifythesqldbtypeforanado.net.aspx relnofollowshould always explicitly specify the data typea, which is going to require a lot of code changes.  Id imagine there would be less problems if the framework simply preserved the original value of the .NET DateTime value.  If the database field type happens to be the less precise SQL DateTime type, then the datetime string value passed to the query will simply be truncated by the database engine.  If its out of bounds, youll get an error, as expected.  More importantly, if the database field type is datetime2, then everything will flow smoothly and records will match properly.p

Negative 3988 pI have a very big table with many columns. Values in some of the columns change rarely, and as its bad to store all of this data in a single table, I would like to partition the table into many tables based on timestamp. That is, for one timestamp, one table is made, while querying all these tables should give the abstraction of one single table. That is, the query should be only executed on the required tables  based on the time range query and all these results should be merged.p  pThus I need two functionalitiesp  ul liAutomatic sparse implementationli liStorage as multiple table based on timestamp and abstraction of hitting a single tableli ul  pWhich tool is best suited for this purpose Would Cassandra be suitablep

Negative 3988 pI am using didSelectRowAtIndexPath in xcode 4.2 on iOS 5.0p  pIt works fine emfor the first 3 rows of the tableem but is not called on the forth or subsequent ones. My evidence that it is not called is an NSLog entry in the method touching rows 1,2 or 3 spits out a log but touch row 4,5 and up, no log.p  pI assume that, since it works for the first three rows, I must have the delegate stuff plugged correctly.  All the rows emlookem the same, and if I rearrange the data the problem stays with the forth and higher rows, so doesnt look like a data issue.p  pNot enabled editing. p
Negative 3988 pIm building a multiOS mirroring system which I would like to implement using a hybrid clientserver and p2p communication method at least thats the best way I have of describing it. p  pMy issue is that at some point I have a central server appengine, so there are limitations to what I could do because of time and networking capability constraints that would need to get a message to a host of different devices which are not necessarily running the same OS Windows, Android, iOS, Linux, etc.... p  pAndroid and iOS or any other mobile platform are the main problems it looks like I will be having on 2 levels. p  p1  They are both limited by battery power more so than a laptop and desktops shouldnt have that issue at all, so whichever method I use needs to take that into account.p  p2  NAT harder because the user has relatively less control over their firewall than on a network that they are running. My central server will maintain a table of which device has what IP address, but from what I understand if there is NAT or a firewall it wont be able to get to it if the port was not forwarded.p  pSince I will be writing a specific client for each OS I prefer a solution that is more universal. I have been leaning towards writing an extremely simple HTTP server that sits on each client and takes requests which appengine is able to send and treats them as messages that alert the client to perform an action either with the server or another client. However, I run into the issue of NATfirewall. For instance if appengine needs to send a message to AndroidDevice1 it would grab its IP address from a table and make a request to it. However this doesnt work if the ports arent forwarded correctly, and if the user is on 3g4g the firewall is controlled by the data provider.p  pBecause of this, I started thinking about using Android C2DM but I want a solution I could implement across platforms.p  pThe only other method I could think of is to just have the client poll the server for messages. This has the battery and network consumption issue though. p  pWould there be any other way to implement this, and if not, which one of the above methods are best in terms of balancing usability, power and data consumption and user input the less the user has to do to get the client set up ie port forwarding, etc... the better Please note that I do not intend for this to become a discussionflame war but a logical presentation of facts. p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 3988 pIve got a bit of a tricky problem in my opinion. Im new to C and OpenGL glut so be gentle Im writing a platformindependent simple program only 2D and need a basic UI, so I have a Button class which generates a Button object. This hopefully will be able to be called dynamically i think thats the right word from inside the displayFunc loop in OpenGL glut. p  pEvery time the loop starts, it instantiates the correct button objects and then destroys them at the end. Of course, the buttons need to be able to do something, so in the glutMouseFunc function, it checks if the mouse clicked in the place needed to set off the button.p  pIt is allowed access to the button member variables xMin.. yMax via getset functions, which are public. However since the button is instantiated by the display loop, I had to create a global vector of pointers to the buttons which is updated as they are created, and cleaned up, along with the objects, at the end of the display loop. This is all fine and dandy I believe.p  pThe tricky thing comes when I actually want a button to change state. The only thing I can come up with is having codestdvectorltboolgt buttonStatescode, which is augmented when the button is created, changed when the button is clicked, and destroyed when the button is.p  pOf course, this change of state doesnt carry through to the next loop of display, so I tried codestdvectorltboolgt btnStatesCopycode, which maintains a copy of the buttonStates vector by using codebtnStatesCopy  buttonStatescodewhen it changes, but is not destroyed at the end of the display loop. When the buttons are created, the button states now are copied from the btnStatesCopy vector, which has not changed since the last loop.p  pUnfortunately, this crashes my program, even when trying to print the btnStatesCopy vector. So I was wondering if you had any idea why it might crash, and what I might do to avoid it I can post code, but Im not sure it would help.

Negative 3988 pI have an application that allows you to share certain data in Facebook. You can create data in my application, and then share a journal of some of the information by use of a Facebook custom object I have created within my Facebook app.p  pWhen a friend clicks on the link in my users timeline, I redirect them to the site where the Journal is displayed. The site creates all of the pertinent og meta tags and whatnot. Then it gets the data from my database based on the ID passed back from Facebook, and shows the Journal entry.  Only those who are within the authorization group the user defined for my application should be able to do this.p  pThe problem I have is that the Facebook authentication is handled client side via JavaScript and the data collection is handled server side. I realize I can call the auth from the server, or ship the token to the server via AJAX, but both of those seem sorta hacky. I am looking for a pattern for this kind of thing, figuring that others have done it before.p

Negative 3988 pIm looking for an algorithm for which I do not have the VBA knowledge to script myself. So Im stuck. It isnt through lack of effort trying because I have given it a go plus, this bit of code is the last remaining piece of my bigger VBA code I simply lack the knowledgeexperienceskill...p  pBasically, I have an Excel file. In this file is a sheet, sheet1. Sheet1 contains many rows of data. The number of rows contained in sheet1 can vary from 1 to n. Sometimes, I may have 50 while other times I may have 30, etc. What is consistent is the layout of the book, i.e. I have codes in column A which identify a product in my database.p  pWhat I want to do is thisp  pstrong1.strong Scan the sheet for empty rows due to the way the workbook is generated, I sometimes have blank rows and remove them. These blank rows are sometimes inbetween rows with data while at other times may be trailing at the end of the sheet.p  pstrong2.strong After removing the blank rows find the last used row. Store that to a variable. I have found this piece of code useful for doing thatp  pcodemylastrow  myBook.SheetsResults.Cells.Findwhat, SearchOrderxlByRows, SearchDirectionxlPrevious.Rowcodep  pstrong3.strong Starting from the row determined in 2, I want to take the product code in Ax where x  mylastrow and find any other occurrences of it in column A. If any are found, delete that entire row corresponding to it. Importantly, this loop must go in reverse. For example lets say codemylastrow  40code, the loop will need to begin at A40 and on the next iteration do A39 or 38 if a row has been removed. This is because with any of the product numbers the corresponding data in the row contains more data further down the column because of the way the sheet was generated. Essentially the entry closest to the last row is the most recent.p  pHopefully Ive been able to explain the situ properly. But if not and youre willing to take the challenge my burden off me I would be very grateful.p  pQFp
Negative 3988 pHow do you solve this common problemLets say you need to render few form elements depending on some Ajax eventbut not the whole form and you dont want to break forms layout.

Negative 3988 pIve seen questions similar to this one, but the scenarios are not exactly the same, nor can I get an answer that works on my problem.p  pI have the source code for a C library. We need to use this library as part of an android application but it also needs to be available for third party to use as a C library.p  pI have a makefile that generates the .a file out of the librarys source code, using ndks compiler. Thats the pure C part.p  pOn the Java part, I have a simple demo project with a simple activity containing a button.

I tried to have the latter using cpp as well, but compiler complains. Could this be part of the problemp  pThe error code that I get when trying to compile the Android.mk file is undefined symbol, so, is the list of functions in simplelibrary.a theres actually 1 function not visible to hellojni.c because of it being C and not plain Cp  pAnother thing you might notice is Im trying to build the static library on its own makefile as opposed to generating it with Android.mk theres a reason for that, but at this point I would also be happy if I had to have it in generated by Android.mk if thats what it takes.p  pI dont see any way to add an attachment in here so that to share a zip with the project. Let me know if theres something Im missing.. Otherwise the code is in a depot in bitbucket, so I can easily share it with anyone having an account there too.p  pThanks for you answers. p

Negative 3988 pId like to apologize in advance if the question is a little vague but its hard for me to provide a specific part of the code that could be responsible for what is going on.p  pI extended a BaseExpandableListAdapter to use in one of my Activities StreamActivity to populate an ExpandableListView. This Activity is part of an ActivityGroup. Then, it turned out I needed a very similar adapter for a different Activity StreamUserActivity that is not part of a group. I decided to extend my custom adapter further and only override certain methods that are different. The logic behind the row structure is the same for both adapters.p  pHowever, when I use the second adapter, the one for the standalone Activity, when I call notifyDataSetChanged, before the list gets updated the screen goes black. On some occassions it is just a temporary blink, sometimes it stays that way. Then, if I scroll the list, it appears again but an element above the ExpandableListView does not reappear. Still, I can touch the active elements in this element and it reacts be transferring me to another Activity, as planned.p  pThe StreamUserActivity is started from within the StreamActivity the following wayp  precodeIntent streamUserProfiletIntent  new Intentthis, StreamUserProfileActivity.class streamUserProfiletIntent.putExtraStreamUserProfileActivity.USERJID, OpenfireRosterProvider.getInstancegetApplicationContext.getCurrentUser.getJabberId startActivitystreamUserProfiletIntent codepre  pThis causes the screen to go black.

Negative 3988 pstrongQuestionstrongp  pHow can i implement a PHP callback being passed over AJAX with the PHP callback being called by the page requested by AJAXp  pstrongThe Setupstrongp  pComments are posted via AJAX and the paramaters are passed serialized and encrypted so they cant be changed in transit or carefully crafted AJAX requests to abuse the comments system. The problem is, i need the new total comments amount to update a field in a different mysql table which will change in every place the comments are used than what the comments are in themselves.p  pstrongExamplestrongp  pSomeone leaves a comment on a forum topic, that topic needs to know the total comments without querying the comments table everytime this needs to be known. The problem is, when the comments are posted via AJAX we dont know what the table is to update, what fields, etc as well as having to execute additional code along with it such as also logging all the members who have left comments on the specific topic.p  pstrongSolutionstrongp  pI thought about adding two PHP callbacks using closures when declaring the comments widget. These two callbacks onSuccess onFailure would then be able to do what ever work is needed such as counting the total comments and updating the total comments count for the specific forum topic. Then serialize, encrypt it, pass it as a parameter over ajax, then PHP to decrypt and unserialize the callbacks and execute them.p  pstrongWhy The Solution Breaksstrongp  pBecause closures cant be serialized Also, i am NOT using eval before anyone suggests it.p  pstrongThe Question Againstrongp  pHow can i implement a PHP callback being passed over AJAX with the PHP callback being called by the page requested by AJAXp  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pIt would appear that some of you are not reading the whole question and understanding that callbacks are to be done in PHP  NOT javascript using the AJAX callbacks. AJAX is only used to transport the posted comment  not process it thats what PHP does and thats where the callback comes in which is the problem.p

Negative 3988 pI would like users to install the widget component of my app. Currently my mainactivity simply pops up a textview saying that there is a widget and to see their widget list. p  pUnfortunately right now, this requires them to open the mainactivity at all. If they want to see the widget in their list of widgets.p  pI dont want to do anything annoying, but there does seems like there are a lot of hurdles to actually getting and using a widget right now.p  pThings I could do setup an onboot service that checks to see if the widget is on the launcher screen. It could remind users once or twice ever via some kind of notification. The widget can turn off that service using its codeonUpdatecode method or other lifecycle commands. I personally hate erroneous notifications.p  pOne thing Id like to do is programmatically open up the widgets list. is that possible any other best practices Since we cant have widget only apps anymore, Id still like the main component of my app to be a widget.p

Negative 3988 pIt seems that the OS chooses whether to use a PNG or JPEG for reasons unknown. In my case, I want a JPEG sent via mail, twitter, etc. but I tend to get a very large PNG.p  pIf I subclass UIActivityItemProvider and return an NSURL pointing to a file that I created myself by writing a JPEG to disk using UIImageJPEGRepresentation, I can of course get a JPEG. However using an NSURL causes other issues one of them being the inability to use iMessage as a target. Is there any way to use a UIImage, but specify that you would prefer a certain file format Im quite sure the answer is NO, but want to check.p

Negative 3988 pIm using the JQuery plugin videoBG and am having a few problems. Basically what is happening is that the video works offline in all browsers with no problems, but when I check it online, it wont work in FireFox or IE. This tells me that the script is pointing to the correct video but for some  reason is being blocked in FF and IE when online. This was further confirmed when loading offline in IE for the first time. A dialogue box popped up with the message IE has blocked certain scripts from loading on the page, will you allow them to continue I clicked yes and it worked fine. This webpage also has several sounds that play on load and are mutable via an onclick function on an image. These functions are totally fine in chrome and IE, but in Firefox they do nothing  hopefully someone can help me with thisp  pThe website is www.sweetsunnyvibes.comp  pEDITAll my code is within the initial HTML pagep

So if I had both an add and a new button in the ApplicationBar menu, while in default state, this could be very confusing and will force the user to open the menu just to see which button is which.

Negative 3988 pI have texture loading routine in C that calls Java part of my game to do the job. It can load .png as well as .jpg files and create textures from them. It returns back to C the generated textureID generated with glGenTextures.

It works ok when I run the game for the first time  the texture ID generated for front buffer is different from all other texture IDs. But when I press HOME key, then jump back into game again and I reload all textures and recreate front buffer again to recover from context loss the texture ID generated for frontbuffer collides with one of texture IDs generated for textures  like if there were two ID lines.

Maybe there is a way to find out using the ListItem of the user. But I did not see any fields that show that user is administrator. I have also tried EnsureUser.

The result shows that divisions are actually faster and on better cases the difference between the two calculations become negligible. Here the TESTRATE  1000000.p  pI know that multiplications have a fixed cycle where as divisions can take up to 24 cycles at worst case, but is this the same for ARM architecture In my code that I am trying to port I have various divisions that have dynamic denominators so I was considering using a fast reciprocal function to get the reciprocal and multiply it instead of dividing it, and based on the result from the test above Im thinking it might not render the result that I am expecting.

Also the Javas JITcompiling can make a difference.p  pThe if statement introduces branching and additional read that wouldnt happen if we always overwrote var with X, so its bad. On the other hand, if codevar  Xcode then using this optimization we perform only a read and we do not perform a write, which could have some effects on cache. Clearly, there are some tradeoffs here. Id like to know how it looks like in practice. Has anyone done any testing on thisp  pEDITp  pIm mostly interested about how it looks like in a multiprocessor environment. In a trivial situation there doesnt seem to be much sense in checking the variable first. But when cache coherency has to be kept between processorscores the extra check might be actually beneficial. I just wonder how big impact can it have Also shouldnt the processor do such an optimization itself If codevar  Xcode assigning it once more value codeXcode should not dirtup the cache.

Negative 3988 pI am creating a custom interfacescreen in java. Part of this interfacescreen takes a given image and then chops it up into a given number of sections randomly and then draws them on the screen with slight movements. Over the top of this is drawn an overlay which blots out most of what is going on underneath. This was obviously very inefficient as much of what was being drawn could not be seen and I thought it was causing the interfacescreen to stall briefly when first start. I amended the code so that only the sections that can be seen through the overlay are drawn expecting this to fix the problem of slow down at start up but it hasnt.p  pWhen I print out the timings for my draw loop the first three times are high about 500ms, then 300ms, then 20ms and the rest are a stable 16ms or 60 fps for the rest of the time.p  pIs there anything else that might be causing this slow down at the start Is it possible that java is somehow optimising my drawing in those first 1000 or so ms so that it can run at 16ms for the rest of the time Like realising that some of whats being drawn cant be seen and then optimising so it isnt actually drawn every update  I dont really know Im sort of out of ideas as to what could be causing this.p  pIve checked thoroughly to make sure no objectsthreadsassets are being loaded once the update starts, this is the only thing I can think of.p  pAny help greatly appreciated.p

Negative 3988 pIt appears when doGetAuthorizationInfoPrincipalCollection principals in the org.apache.shiro.realm.AuthorizingRealm is called the UsernamePasswordToken passed is that of another user.p  pThe trace below explains what I am getting atp  pfetching List user1  fetching List user1role  roles for user user1 isare user1role.. permissions for user user1 isare iswapiservice1, iswapiservice2..p  pThose are print outs from the custom implementation of the AuthorizingRealm. Basically, I get the principalsp  pString user  String getAvailablePrincipalprincipalsp  pand I fetch the roles for that user which prints out the  fetching List ..... line. Surprisingly, the user being printed is user1, when in reality the user that made the call is user2.p  pThe question is, why is getAvailablePrincipalprincipals returning user1 instead of user2 Is that the right call to make to know the current owneruser of that context I believe getAvailablePrincipalprincipals should return the user in the SHIROSECURITYTOKEN header, but this is not happening.p  pAfter a few researchdebugging, I realize Shiro gets the current threads user by doing  p  pSubject currentUser  SecurityUtils.getSubjectp  pHowever, the problem is in camel OSGi, the thread is always reused therefore the new request coming in a reused thread will always have the user of the first thread.p  pThis I found out printing out the thread runing the Realm which I found out has a thread id and thread name of user1. Hence, user1s roles will always be fetched for user2.p  pIf my assumptions are correct, how do I go about ensuring a new thread for a new requestp  pNote My camel bundle uses directvm component which I think uses the thread of the sourceoriginating endpoint.

Negative 3988 pSo i released an app and all seemed fine. All of a sudden I got reviews in and emails that he app did not function and was doing weird things. Turns out the users were using iPhone 4s and 5. I have an iphone 4 running 6.1.3 and everything worked great. As i did some testing in xcode i found using iPhone sim with 3.5 inch screen everything worked perfect. If I switched to the 4 inch retina display it went crazy... button functions from other screens mixed in with current view. Long story short... I went in and fixed it and ran tests using the simulator. all my tools are updated and everything looks good. I released update to iTunes so everyone who had issues could now use the app.p  pBut... a couple people i have been speaking with say the issues are still there. I do not understand how since I test in the simulator. Does anyone know how to properly test an app on the any version iOS and if it works on the sim it will work on an actual device. I am completely baffled by this issue. p  pI am using xcode 4.6.2 with iOS SDK 6.1 and my app deployment target is 4.3p

Negative 3988 pTo preface this question, I am very VERY new to htmlCSS so go easy on me please p  pI am currently designing a webpage that has a fixed position header at the top.  The header contains a logo, some dropdown menus, and a right floated container showing the name of the person currently logged in.p  pThe problem that happens is if I resize the screen to be smaller, the elements of the header wrap onto the next line.p  pThe gray background is a parent div holding the logo, the drop down menus, and the logged in info with a width of 100, a fixed height and fixed position.  I initially had the logo and the list of menus set to floatleft to keep them inline, but have been playing around with displayinlineblock to see if that can help anything sadly, it hasnt much.  The container all the way on the right holding Logged in as Alex  is set to float rightp  pI have tried giving the header bar a fixed width, as well as setting its overflow to auto  neither option fixed the problem.p  pIn my perfect world, at the point where the content begins to wrap now, I would like the entire page to horizontally scroll instead of pushing the content to the next line.  A good example of the functionality Im looking for is the top bar on Youtube, where the items squish together as you minimize the screen and the page starts to scroll horizontally when they cant be squished any closer.p  pIve been struggling with this for many hours over the last few days, and happy help or direction would be greatly appreciated.

Negative 3988 pI am referring to the titanic pattern explained in the zeromq guide. Can someone please explain why it recommends not using a keyvalue store as compared to readingwriting disk files for persistence. Quoting from the guidep  precodeWhat Id not recommend is storing messages in a database, not even a fast keyvalue     store, unless you really like a specific database and dont have performance worries.

Negative 3988 pI need to port a snippet of C to C that decodes some BCD bytes, but Im pretty new to C, so Ive run into a problem with using the ,  and amp operators.p  pHeres the encoding description.p  blockquote   pData on the FASCN is encoded using a process called Binary Coded   Decimal BCD. It uses 5 bits per character 4 data bits and 1 parity   bit and results in a 16character set. Encoding the full 40character   FASCN in BCD digit format results in 200 bits of information. Rather   than transmit the data one character at a time, the data can be packed   such that each transmitted byte contains 8 meaningful bits e.g. the   full 5 from Character One plus the first 3 from the Character Two.

Negative 3988 pIm developing a highspeed, highresolution video camera for robotics applications. For various reasons I need to adopt gigabit ethernet 1Ge or 10Ge to interface my cameras to PCs. Either that or Ill need to develop my own PCIe card which I prefer not to do more work, plus then Id have to create drivers.p  pI have two questions that I am not certain about after reading linux documentation.p  p1 My desired ethernet frame isp  precode8byte interpacket pad  sync byte 6byte MAC address destination 6byte MAC address source 2byte packet length varies 6KB to 9KB depending on lossless compression nbyte image data number of bytes specified in previous 2byte field 4byte CRC32 codepre  pThe question is, will linux accept this packet if the application tell linux to expect AFPACKETs assuming applications CAN tell linux this It is acceptable if the application that controls the camera sends packets to it and receives the image data in packets must run with root privilege.p  p2 Which will be fasterp  precodeA linux sockets with AFPACKET protocol B libpcap application codepre  pSpeed is crucial, because packets will arrive with little space between them, since each packet contains one horizontal row of pixels in my own lossless compression format unless I can find a better algorithm that can also be implemented in the FPGA at real time speeds.  There will be a pause between frames, but that is after 1200 or more horizontal rows ethernet frame packets.p  pBecause the application is robotics, each horizontal row will be immediately decompressed and stored in a simple packed array of RGBA pixels just like OpenGL accepts as textures. So robotics software can immediately inspect each image as the image arrives row by row and possibly react as quickly as inhumanly possible.p  pThe data for the first RGBA pixel in each row immediately follows the last RGBA pixel in the previous row, so at the end of the last horizontal row of pixels the image is complete and ready to transfer to GPUs andor save to disk. Each horizontal row will be a multiple of 16 pixels, so no padding is required.p  pNOTE The camera must be directly plugged into the RJ45 jack without routers or other devices between camera and PC.p

I thought FindBys was my solution, but apparently that is not how it works. Its the equivalent of driver.findElementoption1.findelement.option2. Thats not what I need. I need something that will find an element by one or the other locators. If one doesnt work, then use the other locator. Is there a way to do this in Selenium using FindBy annotationsp

Negative 3988 pA nonARC precompiled static library Im using is sending my ARC app event NSObjects on my main thread, that it has placed in the mainthreads autorelease pool. My app acts on the event object in a handler function, but doesnt retain or release it, and doesnt use it again.p  pWith Zombies on, I am occasionally getting a break when the main event loop drains the top level autorelease pool and one of these event NSObjects is being deallocated.

Negative 3988 pI have a rest service developed in Java that runs on Apache Tomcat.  This service is implemented by a class and I explicitly defined a constructor for it. Im load testing it and I found out the constructor is being called multiple times. Then the number of resources being allocated in the constructor is continuously increasing and probably faster than the GCs freeing resources. Im trying to understand the reason why the constructor is called multiple times. I suppose the service is being unloaded too fast by Apache and then it has to be created again to process a new request. Any hint about why this could be happeningp  pThis is just a snippet of what I havep  precodePathmyservice public class ProcessService      private DBConnection conn     final static public String APPID  MYAPP      public ProcessService              System.out.printlnCONSTRUCTOR CALLED          conn  new DBConnectionAPPID         System.out.printlnCONSTRUCTOR CALLED2          ...      ... codepre  pThanks in advance.p
Negative 3988 pIm using VS 2013 and SQL Svr 2012 and trying use EF to populate a gridview.  As this is a very simple test, I have just one table with a key and a couple of data fields.

However, I dont have the skill level to deal with a VS release that is buggy.  It seems to me that this EF execise could be due to a either a bug or some odd corruption on my computer  Im trying to figure out which is the case.  I installed VS 2013 Express and SQL Svr 2012 on a clean machine that had none of these tools in the past.p  pId really like to see someone who is very familiar with Visual Studio try to replicate my problem as it only takes a few minutes to do sop  ol lipIn MS SQL Server, create a tiny DB with one table that has a primary key and a couple of data fields and populate with some test data  Call it TinyDB with TestTable1.pli lipUsing VS 2013 Express for Web, create an New Web Site with the option for ASP Empty Web Site using VB.pli lipAdd an ASP AppCode Folder containing an ADO.Net Entity Data Model and leave the name as Model.pli lipGenerate the model from the DB and make a New Connection for TinyDB and using Entity Framework 6.0 and then select TestTable1.

Negative 3988 pLet me start by clarifying what this question is NOT.  Its not a request for an simple explanation of how Flash memory management or garbage collection works reference counting, mark and sweep, etc..  Nor is it a request for tips for avoiding memory leaks like recycling renders, weak references, removing event listener, IDispose pattern, stopping timers, avoiding static pointers and pointers from global object like stage, etc.p  pAssume you have a reasonably large Flex program coded in MXML and Actionscript, and assume that it is coded by persons who are reasonably conversant in all of the above, and assume it STILL has a memory leak.  At this point it is necessary to debug the problem, and the question is how to do it.p  pThe Flash Builder Premium IDE can take a memory snapshot at time A and time B, and then compare the two snapshots, and then report on loitering objects.  To use this, a program is run to a steady state time A, then it is run some more time B, and the implicit assumption is that the system should contain approximately the same objects  if it doesnt then the new ones are loitering the memory leak.  Conveniently, the IDE will provide a list of pointers leading to each loitering object.p  pBut the IDE doesnt appear to provide the critically important information which of those pointers are locking an object in memory and preventing garbage collection, vs. which are merely pointers from child objects cycles that should go away naturally if the object is collected.  While the IDE does flag some pointers as gcroot, anecdotally pointers from child objects are often usually flagged as gcroot so this flag doesnt provide the necessary information.  Since a reasonably sized program can have a LOT of objects, and since they can be connected in a complex graph via pointers, it is difficult to use the IDE to find which pointers are causing memory leaks.p  pThus, my question is, does anyone have any tips beyond what is already mentioned above on how to find the cause of memory leaks in a Flex program implemented in Actionscript and MXMLp

What am I missing or not doing How can I make all of the text appear in the landscape view as well I appreciate any advice that anyone can give.p

Negative 3988 pI understand that you can override Android WebView functionality using the iWebViewClienti and have been successfully implemented in many areas.

Negative 3988 pI have been educating myself on Async  Await use and I think I understood underthehood concept. However, most of Channel 9 tutorials, MSDN articles and Stackoverflow answers on Async  Await use GUI based applications Windows form application to demonstrate the power of Async  Await. However, I noticed a fundamental difference in Async  Await use in UI thread based application vs. regular ThreadPool thread based applications e.g. ASP.NET Web Application or Console Application etc.. p  pSince, in UI thread based application, the UI thread is always available unless the process is stopped explicitly or by Windows, so the ThreadPool thread responsible for executing the code after await in any async method, will guarantee to find the UI thread to post the results back if any. p  pHowever, in console application or ASP.NET Web application, the main thread in console application or the Http request in ASP.NET web application must be waiting at one point of time until all async operations are completed. So there should be .Wait and .Result call somewhere after the Async method call, if there is nothing more to work on.p  pIs this understanding correct I am not questioning the benefit of having async for IO bound or network bound operations I understand how its going to increase application scalability. p
Negative 3988 pI added an HTML Assertion to my JMeter test.  It returned many errors and warnings for the html page.  I copied and pasted the same html code into the w3 validator and it returned much less warnings and errors.  The w3 validator was set to HTML5 and HTML 4.1 Strict on separate occasions.  I thought I would see the exact same errors  warnings in both instances.p  pI am not concerned about trying to figure out the exact differences.  I do not care much about that.  Both JMeter and the w3 validator are helping me clean up the code.  That is fine.p  pWhat I am wondering is what JMeter uses as its standard for the HTML Assertion  Basically, what is it using to compare against when it points out the errors  warnings.  p  pI also saw JTidy in JMeter.  I looked up JTidy which is just a java port of HTML Tidy.  But, I do not know what HTML Tidy uses as a standard.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 3988 hr  h2Motivationh2  pI occasionally, despite their inadequacies, find C codeTuplecodes useful. brbrbr Of these times, there have been reasons for dabbling in large codeTuplecodes over more initially obvious approaches such as creating a specific class or struct or a general, for example tree like class.p  pThey include being able to define codeTuplecodes in more placesscopes. Usually in more local andor temporary scopes such as inside functions right where needed and invisible elsewhere, or as return types, even in array definitions. codeTuplecodes are also in some respects less bulky than normal classes and those with instantiated nested classes. Sometimes, although often a weakness, even the data structure like feel of a codeTuplecodes members being automatically named codeItem1code codeItem2code etc... can be preferable.p  hr  h2Issueh2  pOr more an issue of elegance, see motivation above.p  pSee this pseudo C codep  precodevar t  new Tuplelt     Tupleltfloat, floatgt,     Tuplelt         Tupleltbox, box, UInt16gt,         Tupleltfloat, float, float, floatgtgtgt     1.5, 1.5,          new box2, 2, new box3, 2, 4,         1.5, 1.8, 1.6, 1.8 codepre  hr  pBut as shown in the actual code below, the type name repetition required increases superlinearly to the number of nodesmembers.p  precodevar t  new Tuplelt     Tupleltfloat, floatgt,     Tuplelt         TupleltBox, Box, UInt16gt,         Tupleltfloat, float, float, floatgtgtgt     new Tupleltfloat, floatgt1.5, 1.5,     new TupleltTupleltbox, box, UInt16gt, Tupleltfloat, float, float, floatgtgt         new Tupleltbox, box, UInt16gtnew box2, 2, new box3, 2, 4,         new Tupleltfloat, float, float, floatgt1.5, 1.8, 1.6, 1.8 codepre  hr  precodenodes 14 that are leaves 8 types stated in first example 14  types stated in the CSharp code 38     If all leaves were classes, like box 45     In a 31 node, 16 leaf, binary tree 113 codepre  pbr Itll get worse still with more size, so far being 3.6x, imagine this line of codep  precodebyte byte byte byt count  4 codepre  hr  h2Questionh2  pIs there a way to avoid this repetition of the specification of typesp

Negative 3988 pIve spent the past couple hours combing this site and the web for a solution to my problem.  Im certain it is an issue of syntax, and that its a simple fix.

Negative 3988 pI currently have a number of ViewModels in my WPF application that requires data from a WCF service. Currently, each ViewModel stores a reference to a different serviceproxy. The problem is, the WCF is not closing gracefully server is reporting unexpected closing of the connection on application exit and if the user is idle for long periods the connection times out.p  pI was thinking about two different ways to use the WCF within my applicationp  ol lipCreate the serviceproxy within the ViewModel and access the data within a Using statement so that I am only keeping the connection open for short periods.pli lipUse a singleton of the WCF that all ViewModels can access for each call.pli ol  pThe problem with 1 is that I made calls to the WCF for CanExecute methods to determine if buttons are enabled or disabled on my GUI. I am concerned that making so many proxies is going to be expensive and slow.p  pThe problem I see with 2 is one I am already noticing if a WCF connection is idle for long periods, it times out and the proxy is faulted. That means even more error handling.p  pIf anyone has a good pattern for this sort of data access, Id appreciate any insight.p  pstrongEDITstrong I get that using the WCF is a bad idea for the CanExcute. If it causes problems, Ill change it but right now this application has 3 users. I am merely looking for a good way to access the service from within my ViewModel that prevents disconnects and is also testable.p

Negative 3988 pIve been working on a project in Java lately that uses a GenericBest Search Algorithm. To make the Algorithm itself Generic, I used a bunch of Generics on all of the Classes used in the Algorithm.p  pHeres all of the ClassInterface Declarationsp  precodepublic class StateSearchltE extends AbstractStateltEgtgt public class AbstractStateltEgt implements StateltEgt public class StateNodeltE extends AbstractStateltEgtgt implements ComparableltStateNodeltEgtgt public class StateQueueltE extends AbstractStateltEgtgt public interface StateltEgt extends ComparableStateltEgtgt codepre  pNow in theory, all of this works just fine. However, when I apply the Algorithm, I plan for E to be some sort of Game State emSay a Checkers Board, Solitaire Game, Pathfinder, whathaveyouem. Thus, I created the following Classp  precodepublic class GameState extends AbstractStateltStringgt codepre  pMy intention for this particular setup is to have the GameState be a container for a String which represents the State of a particular Game. However, this causes an issue for trying to create a StateSearch using the following codep  precodenew StateSearchltGameStategtnew GameStateinitialState, new GameStategoalState codepre  pI end up getting a Bound Mismatch Error, stating that codeGameStatecode is not a valid substitute for codeltE extends AbstractStateltEgtgtcode. Now, I believe I understand why this is happening. My thoughts is because codeGameStatecode extends codeAbstractStateltStringgtcode, and not codeAbstractStateltEgtcode.p  pUnfortunately, I do not want my codeGameStatecode Class to have a Generic Type. It is designed to be implemented to actually do something, thus the switch from Generics to Strings. For example, I might want to create a codeGameStatecode Class in an entirely different project that uses Integers for its implementation.p  pGiven the Methods, Variables, and Operations I use and perform within the codeGameStatecode Class, it cannot be Generic.p  pstrongMy question after all of thisstrong Is there a way to implement my codeGameStatecode Class as a NonGeneric Class in such a way that it satisfies the Bounding Requirements placed by my codeStateSearchcode Classp  pI wouldnt mind if I had to change some of the Class Declarations. The point is that I need the Algorithm to be emGenericem, and the Implementation to be emNonGenericem. The codeGameStatecode Class needs to be the point at which I transition between the two.p  phr strongEditstrongbr I need the codeGameStatecode Class to function as a the implementation of a certain Game. The codeAbstractStatecode and codeStatecode interfaces are meant to allow me to build a State Search Algorithm  without requiring the actual implementation. Settings things up in this manner allow me to apply this setup across multiple games.p  pThe codeStateSearchcode Class basically just pulls States off of my codeStateQueuecode, which is just a Vector of codeAbstractStatecode Classes that is ordered by a priority system emhence the Comparable implementationem. The manner of which the State Tree is expanded is by using the codegetNextStatecode function from the codeAbstractStatecode Class. This is fine and all, but the codegetNextStatecode function basically grabs the best state from my codegetSuccessorscode function, which can strongemonlyemstrong be defined in the codeGameStatecode Class. Everywhere else its just Abstract.p  pI cannot define the codegetSuccessorscode function in a Generic manner, as it is purely based upon implementation. This function is meant to return all possible states from the current state. For example, if the game was TicTacToe, the codegetSuccessorscode function would return a list of Game States where each State represents a possible move.p  pThe codeGameStatecode Class also contains a codegetEstimatedCostcode and codegetRunningCostcode which basically act as the stronghxstrong and stronggxstrong functions respectively. This too may strongemonlyemstrong be defined in the codeGameStatecode Class, as both depend upon Implementation.p

Negative 3988 pThis is my first post to this forum.p  pI have a xml that represents a list of pnr flight bookings. Inside this it has got a list of individual pnrs. Now if there is one invalid field for one pnr, while validating the xml again schema, we are getting soap fault, and the validation seems stopped at the first error point.p  pSo essentially if there are 100 pnrs in a flight, if one pnr has got a invalid field, the entire response is lost due to that one invalid pnr.  The requirement is to reject a pnr if it has got an error, and send the response with the rest of the valid pnr.p  pHow can I achieve this with spring xsd validation either by configuration or programmatically.p  precode    ltcomplexType nameDutBookingsgt     ltsequencegt         ltelement nameRecCount typelong minOccurs1 maxOccurs1gt         ltelement nameDutBooking typetnsDutBooking minOccurs0 maxOccursunboundedgt     ltsequencegt ltcomplexTypegt   lt  gt    ltcomplexType nameDutBookinggt     ltannotationgt         ltdocumentationgt             This holds the booking record.

Negative 3988 pIm building a Browser application using the QtWebkit and QtNetwork modules.p  pLets say that its a requirement that each webpage only be able to access resources from only a specific folder, set aside specifically for it. In this scenario, each webpage would have some kind of ID to identify it which could be used to verify that its accessing the correct folder.p  pThe problem is that its not clear how exactly the createRequest method gets invoked. If its a signal thats emitted or something then I would be able to intercept it and add a few parameters indicating webpage ID.p  pAs such now the only option open to me is to create a separate QNetworkAccessManager for each QWebPage and overload the createRequest function whereas I would really like to be able to share the QNetworkAccessManager across QWebPages.p  pAlternate solutions would be appreciated but generally Im also really confused about how the createRequest method is reached.p  pReference  a hrefhttpqtproject.orgdocqt4.8qnetworkaccessmanager.htmlcreateRequest relnofollowQNetworkAccessManagercreateRequestap

Negative 3988 pI am in the process of converting a database from mysql to mongdb.  My question is in regards to lookup tables.  Say I have a recipe that can have multiple categories.  In mysql, this is achieved with a manytomany lookup between the recipes and categories tables.  In mongodb, I could simply have a recipes collection with a field of categories that contains an array of categories. Text is actually stored in that field, not referenced, like sop  precoderecipe    id xxxxx,   title a recipe title,   categories [catone, cattwo]  codepre  pSo, is this best practice  I prefer this method as it seems easier to maintain than a separate collection and referencing it.  But I see two drawbacks.  One, if a category name changes, you have to update all records, instead of just updating a single lookup record as in mysql. Second, it would seem inefficient to get a list of available categories to use on say a list of checkboxes on an interface.p  pI know many others have had to deal with this issue, so I was just trying to find what is considered best practice.p

Negative 3988 pIm developing a web site using c and MVC4. In one of the sections I have a couple of pie charts that are created using highcharts lib and are based on a table of totals next to the charts. p  pI need to export to excel both the table with the totals and the charts, and I need to do it in a way in which, once exported, if the table changes in excel the graph will also be updated inside the spreadsheet.p  pMy company is using Infragistics to export to excel, so exporting the table is not a problem, but Im not sure how to export the pie charts.p  pI saw a hrefhttpsocial.msdn.microsoft.comForumsvstudioenUSe7dba804f136485f822c48c6709bec57howtocreatepiechartinexcel2003usingcforumvsto relnofollowthisa example where a pivot table is created and feed to the table, but I noticed that it is using native excel libraries instead of Infragistics, Ive been trying to migrate this but cant seem to find the equivalent to Excel.Application inside Infragistics lib.p  pAnother solution that occur to me is that maybe I can enter a formula inside a cell and have it create the pie chart but I dont think this is possible since, if Im not wrong, the pie chart is not even included in a cell, but it is a graphic that floats inside the spreadsheet.p  pSo if anyone has had any experience drawing a pie chart from c to excel using Infragistics and can point me in the right direction would be much appreciated.p  pThanks,p

Negative 3988 pI understand that a multi update will not be atomic and there are chances that the update query may fail during the process. The error can be found via codegetLastErrorcode. But what if I want to roll back the updates that have already been done in that particular query Any method simpler than the tedious two phase commitsp  pFor instance, let me say I have a simple collection of some users and their phone models. Now I do a multi update on all the users who have a Nexus 4 to Nexus 5 Dreamy, isnt it. The only condition being, all or none  so all the N5s are taken back if even one N4 user doesnt get his. Now, somehow the mongodb fails in between, and I am stuck with a few users with N4 and a few with N5. Now, as I have gathered from the net is that I cant have mongo roll back directly. If the operation failed, I will have to do a manual update of the N5 users back to N4. And if that fails too somehow, keep repeating it. Or when I have a complicated collection, I will have to keep a new key viz. codeStatuscode and update it with keywords strongupdatingstrong strongupdatedstrong.p  pThis is what I understand. I wanted to know if there is any simpler way. I assume from the comments the answer is a big no.p

Negative 3988 pIm implementing a classic file and directory navigation system. I need exaclty what version control system like github or bitbucket have. I have a hierarchy that represents files and folders and and what the url route to match the current folder like this codeEntityDetailsentity1rootFolerotherFoldercode. In this url codeEntityDetailsentity1code is fixed when navigating into folders of codeentity1code. The rest of the url should match the path from the root folder to current folder.p  pThe thing is that files and folders can have names that cannot be displayed in the url. I tried to use codeSystem.Web.HttpUtility.UrlPathEncodecode to encode those names and codeSystem.Web.HttpUtility.UrlDecodecode to get them back. But NTFS file system allows a folder to be named code20code and when I use codeUrlPathEncodecode is just returns code20code and the end when I use codeUrlDecodecode it gives me an empty string.p  pI need a way of converting folder names to some string that can be displayed in the url and then convert them back to the original string. I looked for an answer on Internet but couldnt find the key for the solution. Thanks.p

Negative 3988   pI am trying to define a abstract Range class which will serve as the base implementation of a number of range classes.

Im using SourceTree, with the staging pane turned off, and struggling to see why this is so I cant for the life of me see any emactualem real differences.  p  pThe only difference I can see is that a newly added file that I reset over shows up as added with a soft reset, but not so with mixed.  But in either case I can successfully make changes to the newly added file, and recommit.  And of course any new changes I make to existing files get seamlessly added to my current uncommitted changes, ready to be committed. p  pDo I have to use the Staging Pane with Source Tree to see any practical difference, or am I just missing something  To be clear, with how I have the tool set up now, I see uncommitted changes, which I commit in one step.  p

Then the statement code.uploadPicfrmDatacode calls a server side code.gscode function, passing the variable codefrmDatacode.  The code.gscode code receives the object into the arg codeargBlobInputcodep  precodefunction uploadPicargBlobInput      Logger.logargBlobInput   argBlobInput   Logger.logKeys   Object.keysargBlobInput   codepre  pThe codeLogger.logcode shows the passed in data as code[object Object]code, not code[domado object HTMLFormElement FORM]code.  If I use codeObject.keysargBlobInputcode I get a return value of the name of the input field codepicOneUploadcode.  So, codeObject.keyscode works in the code.gscode code.  But, if I use codeObject.keysfrmDatacode in the front end code, no key value gets returned.  I dont understand why codeObject.keyscode will work on an object passed to the back end code, but it will NOT work on the object in the front end code  Maybe something do do with Caja, since this is a Google Apps Script and the HTML is sanitized with Caja  I dont know  But if that is true, why will it successfully pass the object to the back end code, and it works there fine  This makes no sense to me.p  pHow can I get the key values out of the object code[domado object HTMLFormElement FORM]code in the front end  Even if I explicitly use the input name codepicOneUploadcode, which shows up as a key to the object in the back end code codefrmData[picOneUpload]code, it returns nothing.p  pWhat I want to accomplish, is setting the height and width of the image in the front end, before it gets passed to the back end.  But if I cant work with the code[domado object HTMLFormElement FORM]code object, I dont know how Im going to do thatp  pIf is use JSONstingify on that objectp  precodeconsole.logpicUpload data   JSON.stringifyfrmData codepre  pAll I get in the console is  codecodep  pIm guessing that the object is empty except for the image blob.  I guess Ill try putting the file picker in a regular HTML file that doesnt get sanitized by Caja and see what happens.p  pOkay, I ran the same web page and code without using Google Apps Script, and I get the same issue.  It seems that there is an object, it must have an image file in it, but there are no keys in the object  I dont understand this.  The image gets passed to the server, then the server uploads a picture to my drive, all without showing that there is anything in the FORM objectp  pIn firefox the object is named  code[object HTMLFormElement]codep  pDo I need to access a HTMLFormElement different than a regular objectp  pWell, I dont think this has anything to do with Apps Script.  Ive found another method of retrieving the file from the file picker, which returns a file object  [object File].p  pAnd I can get the name and size of that object.p  precodevar fileInput  document.getElementByIdpicOneUpload var file  fileInput.files[0]  console.logfile   file.name  file size   file.size codepre  pOh, I just figured out how to get the FILE object out of the FORM Object.p  precodeconsole.logpicUpload FILE object   frmData.files[0] codepre  pSo, the code[domado object HTMLFormElement FORM]code has yet another object inside of it, the code[object File]code object, but the code[domado object HTMLFormElement FORM]code object has no keys in it I guess  I might be on my way to solving this problem.p  pI changed the arg getting passed from codethis.parentNodecode to just codethiscode, p  precodeltinput namepicOneUpload onchangepicUploadthisgt codepre  pwhich I prefer because I dont need info from all the elements.  Now, instead of getting the FORM object, I get an INPUT object, which I still need to get the FILE object out of.p  pSo there isp  ul li[domado object HTMLFormElement FORM]  Googleli li[object HTMLFormElement]  Firefoxli li[object HTMLInputElement]li li[object File]li li[object Object]li ul  pAnd Im guessing that there is a label object, since I have a label in the form.  Im assuming the the FORM object has the most data in it.p  pUsing Firebug, and the DOM tab, files has a list of properties I guess.p  ul lilastModifiedDateli limozFullPathli linameli lipathli lisizeli litypeli ul  pSo, I guess that is one way to find out what the property names are in the object.p  pPassing codethiscode instead of codethis.parentNodecode doesnt work with Google Apps Script HTML Service.   If I just pass codethiscode with the input Object, I get an error that the zero property is null, or something like that.  And it looks like the image becomes part of the FileUpload class.p  pI found this documentation that shows a file upload a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comappsscriptguideshtmlcommunicationforms relnofollowHTML Service Forms File Uploadap

Negative 3988 pIve had this design problem for the third time and I have a feeling there is a solution out there that I simply cant figure out. I am not satisfied with the way I solved it previously, so here is where you come in.p  pLets say Im designing a C library that is agnostic in which system it gets used in. So I have the following classesp  precodepublic interface IAction      void Execute   public class Trigger      private ListltIActiongt actions      public void CheckConditions              if AllConditionsMet                     ExecuteAllActions                    private void ExecuteAllActions              foreach IAction action in actions                      action.Execute                    protected abstract bool AllConditionsMet   public class BigBulkySystem      private ListltTriggergt triggers      public void CheckAllTriggers              foreach Trigger trigger in triggers                      trigger.CheckConditions                codepre  pSo far so good. We have a list of triggers in the BigBulkySystem which we check ever so often their conditions. If the conditions are met, the trigger takes care of executing its list of actions.p  pThe issue Im having now is that I want to implement a layer that is specifically designed for a hrefhttpsunity3d.com relnofollowUnitya. In Unity, you use a hrefhttpdocs.unity3d.comManualCoroutines.html relnofollowcoroutinesa in order to be able to wait a few frames before continuing the execution of a method. This is exactly what Id want for the Trigger.ExecuteAllActions method. I want to wait for each action to finish executing before moving to the next. In order to do that, I would need to have different signatures for the Trigger and IAction. Here is how this would have been in Unityp  precodepublic interface IAction      IEnumerator Execute   public class Trigger      private ListltIActiongt actions      public void CheckConditions              if AllConditionsMet                      StartCoroutineExecuteAllActions                     public IEnunmerator ExecuteAllActions              foreach IAction action in actions                      yield return StartCoroutineaction.Execute                 codepre  pNotice that a couple of methods now return IEnumerator instead of void, which is the way you define a coroutine in Unity.p  pHere is an example of a Unity action that moves a player object from position 0,0,0 to 1,1,1 in 5 seconds after a 3 second delayp  precodepublic class MovePlayerAction  IAction      public GameObject playerObject      public IEnumerator Execute              yield return StartCoroutineWaitFor3  Wait 3 secs          float animDuration  5.0f         Vector3 initialPos  Vector3.zero         Vector3 finalPos  Vector3.one         float t  0         while t lt animDuration                      playerObject.transform.position  Vector3.LerpinitialPos, finalPos, t  animDuration  Lerp between initial and final             yield return null  Wait a frame             t  Time.deltaTime                    private IEnumerator WaitForfloat secs              float t  0         while t lt secs                      yield return null  Wait a single frame             t  Time.deltaTime                codepre  pSo, my question is strongis there a way to design the system in such a way that I can keep the nonUnity layer free from IEnumerator but also have the Unity layer use themstrongp  pI have a feeling that there is some sort of middle layer, but even so, I couldnt figure out how IAction can have simultaneously codevoid Executecode and codeIEnumerator Executecode.p  pThanksp

Negative 3988 pThe code below is a very simple version of what Im trying to do.  Im trying to trigger a looping function while an element is pressed.  This is for use on a touchscreen, so in production Im actually using hammer.js to unify the touch listeners.  This oddity happens in IE 11. The actual pointer events dont fire until after the contextmenu circle the little browser animation that shows that youre holding a finger down on the browser has completed its attempt at opening the context menu.  p  pIf pressed and released quickly then both the pointerdown and pointerup events are fired in succession along with a single loop.p  pThis only happens in IE 11, chrome behaves as Id expect. This also happens with mouse events and a finger touching the screen, not a mouse and it happens with hammer.js touch and release events.p  pNot surprisingly, if the finger moves while held down the script will work as expected and the context menu circle will not try to open.p  precodevar timer  .panbutton.ontouchstart pointerdown,down.ontouchend pointerup,up  function downe         console.loge.type         this.attroncontextmenu, return false         var self  this         this.loop  function             console.logloop             timer  setTimeoutfunctionself.loop,100                  this.loop       function upe         console.loge.type         clearTimeouttimer      codepre  pI should clarify that this only happens in Windows 7.  Windows 8 behaves as I would expect.  Same version of IE 11.0.9600.

Negative 3988 pI have an issue with my current camera code.  In my app, I can rotate the model that is being viewed, but also need to be able to walk the model.  This means that the user can change the relative orientation of the model, but walking and rotating still needs to be done relative to the plane of the model.p  pFor instance, imagine looking at the model head on, like a building, such that you see the side of the building.  If the user presses W in this case, they will move closer to the building.  Now, they could choose to rotate the models pitch such that they are now looking at the roof of the model or the user could choose to go up high then look down at the ground.  In this case, hitting W needs to maintain the existing altitude, and move forward up towards the top of the screen.  In general, the motion needs to feel as though you are walking relative to the plane of the model, even if the plane as been rotated relative to your point of view.p  pThe same problem exists with looking right and left.  Suppose you are again looking at the side of the building, and hit the arrow keys to look right or left.  The rotation at this point is in the same plane as the model.  But if the user rotates the pitch of the model to look at the roof, then they look right, it rotates about the cameras position instead, and looks like the model rotated away, rather than just spinning around.  Imagine just standing on the ground looking down.  Rotation of the camera would look like the world is spinning, but thats not what I get.  I get the model rotating away, as though you rotate your eye to look towards the sky.p  pHere is my update functionp  precode    mat4.identitythis.eyeMatrix     mat4.identitythis.orbitMatrix     mat4.identitythis.mvMatrix      mat4.fromRotationTranslationeyeMatrix,   this.eyeRotation,   [0, 0, 0]     mat4.fromRotationTranslationorbitMatrix, this.orbitRotation, [0, 0, 0]             mat4.translatethis.mvMatrix, this.mvMatrix, this.orbit     mat4.multiplythis.mvMatrix,  this.mvMatrix, this.orbitMatrix     mat4.translatethis.mvMatrix, this.mvMatrix, this.eye     mat4.multiplythis.mvMatrix,  this.mvMatrix, this.eyeMatrix      this.getModelViewMatrix     this.getProjectionMatrix     this.getNormalMatrix codepre  pWhere orbit and eye are vec3s, orbit and eye matrix are mat4s, and eyeRotation and orbitRotation are quaternions.p  pI have this for changing orbit orientationp  precode    this.orbitYaw    yawAmount     this.orbitPitch  pitchAmount      var orbitRotation  this.orbitRotation      var rotPitch  this.createOrbitPitchRotation     quat.copyorbitRotation, rotPitch      var rotYaw  quat.create     quat.setAxisAnglerotYaw, this.up, this.orbitYaw     quat.multiplyorbitRotation, rotYaw, orbitRotation      this.update codepre  pI have this for changing eye orientationp  precode    var rotYaw  quat.create     quat.setAxisAnglerotYaw, this.up, yawAmount     quat.multiplythis.eyeRotation, rotYaw, this.eyeRotation      quat.rotateXthis.eyeRotation, this.eyeRotation, pitchAmount     quat.normalizethis.eyeRotation, this.eyeRotation      this.update codepre  pAnd finally, I have this for changing eye position forwardp  precode function moveEyedirection, velocity      vec3.scaledirection, direction, velocity     vec3.addthis.eye, this.eye, direction     this.update   function moveEyeForwardvelocity      var dir    vec3.fromValues0, 0, 0     var right  this.getEyeRightVector      vec3.crossdir, right, this.up     vec3.normalizedir, dir      this.moveEyedir, velocity      this.update   function getEyeRightVector      var q   this.eyeRotation     var qx  q[0], qy  q[1], qz  q[2], qw  q[3]      var x  1  2  qy  qy  qz  qz     var y      2  qx  qy  qw  qz     var z      2  qx  qz  qw  qy      return vec3.fromValuesx, y, z  codepre  pstrongSo the question is, how do I ensure that eye motion is always relative to the plane of the model relative to plane of orbit rotationstrongp  p...p

Negative 3988 pI have a m x n rectangular matrix A for which n  m. Given the rank r lt m of A, the reduced QR decomposition yields matrix Q with m x r dimensions, and R with r x n dimensions. The columns of Q are an orthonormal basis for the range of A. R will be upper triangular but in a staircase pattern. Columns in R with a pivot correspond to independent columns in A.p  pWhen I apply qr function from numpy.linalg there is also a version of this function in scipy.linalg, which seems to be the same, it returns matrix Q with m x m dimensions, and R with m x n dimensions, even when the rank of matrix A is less than m. This seems to be the full QR decomposition, for which the columns of Q are an orthonormal basis for Rem. Is it possible to identify the independent columns of A through this R matrix returned by function qr in numpy.linalgscipy.linalgp

Negative 3988 pIm trying to figure out why my Google Chrome console is giving me the error emundefined is not a function.em I have a hunch, but maybe Im on the wrong track. My function codeboxCollision...code is defined at the bottom of my class. Nearer to the top I have a statementp  precode    if this.boxCollisionthis.food.getBBox, this.body[0].getBBox             this.food.translatethis.linkSize, 0 codepre  pthe first line of which is causing the error I mentioned. I think thats maybe because I havent yet defined codeboxCollisioncode, so its essentially nonexistent. Is that right The codegetBBoxcode functions are recognized because theyre from an external JavaScript file.p  precode    function snakegameC, Cw, Ch, spd                   NOTE TO SELF C is a Raphel object.

Negative 3988 pI read your documentation and did all the installations and all, but when I started getting confused is the Server setup aspect of it. Im a mobile developerAndroid, iOS. And my current work needs EMDM and I saw your work which is Very great. My problem is, I dont know how to go about setting up the server and ip and ports for it work. I did all the Script works, and running with java YAJSW. But, setting the iP and trying to access with mobile, sorry Im confused at that point. Please, Im a newbie or no body when it comes to server interpretation, Im all just coding and that. Please, should you have a more detail help, I wouldnt mind. Thank You.p

Negative 3988 pIn my android app I am using a webview to navigate a single page app, built in angularJs.p  pThe different views in the web app are navigated to using relative URLs e.g. login.p  pThe methods goBack and canGoBack work fine, until they hit a page that has a redirect. E.G. the user is on page 2, goBack takes the user to page 1, which redirects to page 2.p  pThe previous solutions to this problem, e.g. a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions16784685webviewbackhistorywithoutredirectsWebView back history without redirectsa, use the methodp  precodeOverride public boolean shouldOverrideUrlLoading      check if a redirect is happening here and if so, go back again  codepre  pHowever this is of no use to me, as because the urls are all relative, shouldOverrideUrlLoading is not called another reason it may not be called is that the links just trigger javascript rather than make GET requests to new URLs.p  pI figured one way to fix this problem could bep  precodeOverride public void onPageFinishedWebView view, String url      ifisGoingBack          ifisRedirect              goBack                codepre  pBut I dont know how to implement those methods Another thing to note is that p  precodegetOriginalUrl codepre  pAlways returns the same initial url no matter how much the user navigates around the webpage. However, p  precodegetCurrentUrl codepre  pdoes return the correct url.p  pAny helpideas would be much appreciatedp

Negative 3988 pBuilding my first angular app and I dont understand how to split the code into smaller chunks. I just have one long runon controller, but if I try to separate the code into separate sections controllers, services, etc, suddenly the data isnt binding to the view anymore ie. I update data, but changes arent showing in the viewbrowser.p  pie. I have a simple app that connects to an api to get a list of Books, it then displays the list, and allows the user to navigate using pagination, or get more details for a single book, or update a book record editdelete.p  pI would like to split the functions up into separate controllers like p  ul listrongsearchstrong controller handles form validation, http to apili listrongbooksstrong list displays results from search apili listrongbookstrong single controller each item in the books list is a single item with calls like more details and editdeleteli listrongpaginationstrong controller functions to nextprev through books listli listrongmessagesstrong controller display a successerror message when doing an action in a search, book, or pagination controllers.li ul  pTrouble is I dont know how to set this up, because if I use services to storeoutput the books model or messages model, when I make an update to this data through one of the controllers, the change doesnt automatically update the view like it would if I updated a scope variable that is linked to a controller.p  pFrom what I understand, a scope variable in a view updates automatically because the codengcontrollerMyCtrlcode is binding to a region. But how would that work with a service You dont use an codengservicecode tag, right...p  pSo lets say I have my searchController call the api, receive a json of all the books. I shove that into the booksService for storage. Then my booksController, which is responsible for updating the list view of all the books on the page, has to load this booksService to get the new data... but how does it know the data was updated How do I link the data from the booksService, through the booksController, to display the new results in the viewp  pAnd also, how would I go about structuring the booksService  how do I get searchController to pass in new data to update a persistent variable I can use for the model, and then how do I get booksController to load in that new data Do I need to create a call from within booksService to PUSH the new data to booksController, or should booksController have a call to PULL the new data from booksService and if so, how would it know when it should make a PULLp  pAs well, searchController and paginationController would be making a GET call with matching query to the same API only difference would be the page variable in the query. Should I be using a service or is it a factory to decouple that http.get requestp  pLastly, whats the best way to structure all of these controllersservices in a folderfile structure Should I be aiming to separate each chunk onto a separate .js file Should I be using require.js to import the files In this case, its a single page of a website where there could be additional other page like this one on the website. If I split the code into separate files, should I group the files in one folder per webpage basis ie. if I add a users dashboard page, all files would be stored in a separate folder from the search books page.p  pSorry, I know Im asking a lot, but this would really help me wrap my mind around the concepts involved in properly structuring an Angular app.p

Negative 3988 pMaybe its a simple question but I checked some questions and Im not able to find a proper solution for my problem. I have a big file divided in 10 columns. In the 9th column there is string containing numbers and letters separated with dots. Something like this p  precodeid.aa.xx.1.rr.2930 id.ee.yy.2.gres.1 id.ww.3232 codepre  pWhat I want is to remove last part of the string after last dot. Then the output should be like this p  precodeid.aa.xx.1.rr id.ee.yy.2.gres id.ww codepre  pAs you can see, the strings dont have the same pattern, so I cant use a split function, and neither rsplit in python because the last field after dots goes from 1 to 6 characters per string. p  pAny easy solution in python or awk  p
Negative 3988 pIm an economist and now Im analysing some qualitative and text data. This is new for me. p  pI want to create a Markov Model for text predicton based on my interviews corpora. I have analyzed a corpora with tm package and after creating a DocumentTermMatrix and the TermDocumentMatrix is equivalent with bigrams pairs of words, I want to compute the probability matrix for each pair of words in order to use it for further Markov Chain prediction. So, I have tried this piece from a hrefhttpwww.salemmarafi.comcodetwitternaivebayes relnofollowhttpwww.salemmarafi.comcodetwitternaivebayesap  precodeprobabilityMatrix ltfunctiondocMatrix     Sum up the term frequencies   termSumsltcbindcolnamesas.matrixdocMatrix,as.numericcolSumsas.matrixdocMatrix    Add one   termSumsltcbindtermSums,as.numerictermSums[,2]1    Calculate the probabilties   termSumsltcbindtermSums,as.numerictermSums[,3]sumas.numerictermSums[,3]    Calculate the natural log of the probabilities   termSumsltcbindtermSums,logas.numerictermSums[,4]    Add pretty names to the columns   colnamestermSumsltcterm,count,additive,probability,lnProbability   termSums      codepre  pBut Im sure that this is not a correct approach to my problem because this code compute the frequency of each pair, but not consider the transition probability from a word to another. I have also seen that there are some implementations of text prediction algorithms in phyton, also in Java see github, but Im not able to translate it to R. Some people has a piece of code to perform this kind of analysis in R or know a package that performs it directlyp  pThanks in advancep  pJosep

Negative 3988 pI am trying to unit test a generated that uses a proprietary generatorcommon to scaffold out all the generic base files.p  pBecause this generatorcommon is proprietary, it lives on a git repository and is linked in the codepackage.jsoncode file via git url for that repo. You cannot link git repos on peerDependencies in the codepackage.jsoncode file, so my generatorcommon is installed as a dependency.p  pHere is where I start running into issues if my generatorcommon is installed as a peer dependency, I have no problem mocking it with .createDummyGenerator, but if I change it to a dependency, I can no longer mock the generator the same way, and my unit tests fail timeout because generatorcommon is called instead of mocked.p  pIs there a way to mock a generator installed as a dependency If so, how Thank you for any help you can provide.p

Negative 3988 pHi i would like to use bootstrap themes inside some websites that i am developing, however after looking at the documentation and searching online i have found it somewhat troubling that there is no explicit how to guide start to finish with using bootstrap themes, a hrefhttpstartbootstrap.comtemplatecategoriesall relnofollowlike found herea. Furthermore i would like to download multiple themes into my project directory, extract them into the appropriate folders e.g. css,img,js,ect... and utilize them inside of my html files like sop  precodeltdiv classcustomizedbootstrapitemgtmyItemltdivgt codepre  pI am having a bit of trouble trying to do this because it seems there is no universality among the themese.g. each one may vary in how they work and i dont want to hack together some dirty code if there is a proper way of doing it. So my question is , is there a proper way of adding themes into your existing project purely for aesthetics and customizing them by exchanging the appearance between one them and other themes, and if so how  Can you guys point me towards some tutorials I need to know more about how linking these js and css files will affect other aspects of the themes, and how the html tags can be used properly in a uniform way across many themes, as i wont settle likely on just one theme.p  peditp  pAfter trying some of the suggestions i managed to figure out at least some of the problems i was having by including the css style of the specific theme that i want to use as a stylesheet link in the head section of the html page that i want to apply it to, which seems pretty straight forward anyway. However im still a little bit perplexed on how to get all of those cool elements that i see in the themes, especially the dashboard themes into my custom html page. A good example of a theme that i am looking at is a hrefhttpalmsaeedstudio.comAdminLTE relnofollowfound herea. If you guys could give me a bit of insight on how to get those elements on the page i.e. dashboards, panels, UI elements etc... that would be great. I may be mistaken but i dont think they are normal bootstrap classes, although im fairly new to bootstrap so im not 100 sure on that.p

Negative 3988 pIm learning CoreOSDocker and am trying to wrap my mind around a few things.p  pWith Java infrastructure, is it possible to use the JVM in its own container and have other Java appsservices use this JVM container If not, Im assuming the JVM would have to be bundled in each container, so essentially you have to pull the Java dockerfile and merge my Java services essentially creating a Linux Machine  Java  Service container running on top of the CoreOS machine. p  pThe only other thought I had was it might be possible to run the JVM on CoreOS itself, but it seems like this isnt possible.p
Negative 3988 pIm trying to get an idea if I should start using flexbox for websitewebapp layout design as opposed to floating divs, etc.p  pBut Im getting mixed messages. On one website theyre saying that flexbox is now the holy grail for page layout a hrefhttpphilipwalton.github.iosolvedbyflexboxdemosholygrail relnofollowhttpphilipwalton.github.iosolvedbyflexboxdemosholygrailap  pYet Tab Atkins, the guy that created the css3 flex spec has a page called Why flexboxes Arent good for page layout a hrefhttpwww.xanthir.comblogb4580 relnofollowhttpwww.xanthir.comblogb4580ap  pI watched a video about this a hrefhttpvimeo.com98746172 relnofollowhttpvimeo.com98746172ap  pSo my conclusion is that he means that it shouldnt be used for complex page layouts. And that displaygrid would be better suited. However, grid will probably take a few more years to reach all popular browsers.p  pSo my question is, as of right now, is flexbox better for creating page layouts than the current solutions out there div floats, displaytablecell, inlineblocks, etc and is flexbox what I should use until grid comes out p  pp.s I know that flexbox isnt compatible with older browsers. But Im talking hypothetically here, for this question lets just assume that isnt a problem.p

However, while it will clearly test whether a string is legal, it is not obvious to me if there is any way to exclude illegal strings.  For example, using the words cite and cat where the t and e are terminal states, a DAWGDAFSA would look like thisp  precode      c            a   i              t              e codepre  pand cit and cate will be incorrectly recognized as legal strings without some metainformation.p  pQuestionsp  p1 Is there a preferred way to store metainformation about stringspaths such as legality in a DAWGDAFSAp  p2 If a DAWGDAFSA is incompatible with the requirements efficient searchinsertion and storing metainformation whats the best data structure to use  A minimal memory footprint would be nice, but perhaps not absolutely necessary.p

Negative 3988 pIve noticed that JSSOR duplicates the slides div and its content in the DOM. This is probably done for a good reason and causes no issue whatsoever. p  pHowever, in order to implement some custom click functionality with a lightbox Colorbox with grouping functionality, I needed to write a jquery selector for the individual images inside the slides. While that works, with the duplicate DOM I get the slides twice the correct ones appearing last. p  pIs there a way to properly select only the displayed slides without the duplicates  p

Negative 3988 pI am currently working on a project that will be written with EXTJS 5 and Ive been asked to minimize the number of special purpose controls required by the UI, and to rely on existing EXTJS 5 components and simple customizations as much as possible.p  pThere is a form going in the UI that would benefit from having a combobox with the selection area displayed like a singleselect tree view. I have done some research and know that the EXTJS 5 combobox does support customization but I am not familiar enough with the package and dont have the time to become more familiar with it to be able to tell whether it would be possible to customize it to use an EXTJS 5 tree control.p  pIve done some searching on Google and these forums and have not found anything which specifically addresses this question and would appreciate advice, and possibly an example if it is possible, from those more knowledgeable than I am.p  pThanks.p
Negative 3988 pI have a very complex bunch of libs and executables taken over Linux. The whole system was developed using static libraries in the past, then a couple years ago the libs are migrated to be shared libraries fPIC etc. Checking the dependencies I found out, that there are two shared libs libA and libB p  ul lilibA calls some functions from libB li lilibB calls some functions from libAli ul  pI would like to build the libs having proper dependencies libA depends on libB and libB depends on libA. But I cant give llibB to the linker, because the lib is not yet existing at the build time of libAp  pIf I build libA without the dependancy of libB creating unresolved symbols, I have to keep in mind if I use libA I have to link libB also, because of undefined symbols in libA. Thats annoingp  pWhat Im looking for is a possibility to build libA and telling to the linker to create dependancy to libB WITHOUT having libB at this time, is that possiblep  pHow can I solve my problem without merging libA and libB togetherp  pRegards, petersp  hr  pstrongEditstrong  I found out, that I can directly generate an empty lib without writing a source codep  precodegcc shared Wl,soname,libB.so.MAJOR o libB.so codepre  pthen I can build libA adding emlBem to the build command. After that I removed the libB.so. Finally, after installation the libB refers to libA and libA refers to libB.p  pOf course the MAJOR number must match the MAJOR of the libB, this is so, because the major number is common for all libs.p  pIm just asking myself if there is more suitable way to do itp
Negative 3988 pHow can Doctrine ODM be used to create a onetoone bidirectional reference that lazy loads while using a field other than the primary key for the referencep  pI have two collections in MongoDB with documents, Article and ArticleMetaData. For every Article document, there is an ArticleMetaData and vise versa. A OneToOne BiDirectional relationship. For legacy reasons, the two document types need to be in separate collections. Both collections are updated by external systems that have no knowledge about the Mongo IDs. They do however contain a shared field groupcode which can be used to match the right article to its meta data.p  pI try to configure Doctrine in such a way that I can get the meta data for an article object and an article from its meta data object but I want to keep them lazy loaded.

Negative 3988 pI am fairly new to the C dependency management through libraries and dlls. I fully understand the difference between static and dynamic linkingI guess which is why I am asking this, as common answers usually relate to issues with not understanding the difference. Im using visual studio and my current project is set up like thisp  pBridge project this is a dll project that exports a few classes. This serves as a shared library for bridge between networking code and application code. Naturally, it has its own dependencies ZMQ network library, MsgPack serialization, ... which are statically linked using .lib files. My .dll is generated normally and its exported .lib file too. Before I switched to dll project I kept compiling it as .exe to test the code as I coded...p  pApp project This project is an application project and would like to use the bridge to gain full access to networking functionality via bridge. So I add the .lib dependency to it and I know I will have to supply the .dll to the .exep  pHowever my problem is, that the application will not compile, because it is missing header files from ZMQwhich are a bridge .dll dependencies, and not relevant to the app at all, since only bridge internal BL uses them. Is there any way I can bakeinclude all my required dependencies to the bridge dll ZMQ, MsgPack, Log4cpp .... and provided just the bridge.dll to the app ofc, with bridge.lib as a library input Am I misunderstanding something obvious here and am going at this completely the wrong wayp  pThanks for help, greatly appreciated p

Negative 3988 pOk so bear with me as I am not a professional, this is a proof of concept project to learn more about my shell, programming and just basic bash scripting.p  pSo WHAT I WANT TO DO is whenever anything is printed out in my terminal, be it the result of a command or an error message from the shell I want to apply some filters to what is being displayed so for example if I input ls a in the terminal I would like to get the list of folders that the command returns but apply a TIME DELAY to the characters so that it seems like the list is being typed in real time. p  pMore SPECIFICALLY Id like for the script to take every alphanumerical character in STDOUT and spend a specific amount of time say 100 milliseconds iterating through random characters these can be accessed randomly from a list before finally stopping at the original value of the character. p  pWHAT I KNOW not much, I am new to programming in general so also the bash language but I can read some code and browsing through I found this a hrefhttpbrettterpstra.com20120915matrixishabashscriptwithnopracticalapplication relnofollowhttpbrettterpstra.com20120915matrixishabashscriptwithnopracticalapplicationa script that plays with tput. This shows me the visual effect Id like to accomplish can be accomplished...now to make it happen orderly and individually for each character printed to STDOUT...that is what I cant figure out. p  pWHAT I THINK in my mind I know I could take the STDOUT and pipe it to a file in which through any language lets say python I can do all kinds of string manipulation and then return the output to STDOUT but Id like for the characters to be manipulated in realtime so if for example the code was p  precodecoolchars                stdoutwhatever module works to grab STDOUT from shell as string stdout  stdout.split  for word in stdout     for letter in word        n0        while nlt10             print the following iteration in real time  shell but how             print random.choicecoolchars             finally stop at correct character             print letter             n codepre  pAnyway, Ive read a little about curses and ncurses and how you can create new windows with whatever specified parameters, I wonder if itd be just a matter of creating a terminal with the specified parameters with the curses libraries and then making a link so that each new terminal instance opens my modified curses shell or if I can just do a bash shell script or if itd be easiest to use something like python. I know all of the above can be options but Im looking for the simplest, not necessarily most resource efficient answer. p  pAny help, comments, pointers etc is appreciated.p
Negative 3988 pI need some help figuring out what the best and most efficient way to detect wrapping elements spans on a page would be using Angular.  How can I do this with attaching a directive to each element that Im keeping track of Is there a way to have one all encompassing function keep track of when the window resizes, that then alerts all of the elements to check if they are wrapping, and for them to update themselves How can I move this out of the directive so that window.resize isnt called for every element p

Currently in the UI I have the addresses listed out with an Edit button next each onep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comJnVsC.png altenter image description herep  pIm using the Modal syntax that is part of Bootstrap3, and have hidden DIVs that contain a form and the fields to edit an Address. When the user clicks on edit, a modal window form appears that allows the user to edit the Address. Model Binding and validation work within this form. p  pIt works pretty well but I have a few underlying issues with the implementation. I wanted to use the builtin Validation and Model Binding with the Address objects, but I didnt want to post back the whole object just to edit one address.p  pSo I ended up having to create a for loop that writes out the hidden DIVs calling a Partial View and passing Address as the modelp  precodefor int i  0 i lt Model.Addresses.Count i          address  AddressModel.Addresses[i]         Html.PartialAddressModal, address  codepre  pThe unfortunate sideeffect is that the model binding cannot uniquely identify which Address to apply the ModelState to, so Model Binding applies it to all the Address in in the hidden DIVs, instead of the one that was updated. This is because they have the exact same property names.p  pIve got a workaround that was part of an a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions28372330conditionalmodelstatemergeearlier questiona. Basically it doesnt write the ModelState unless the object is invalid. For the invalid scenario I dont show the address list which basically hides the problem. Otherwise every edit button would show the same form content. p  pWhat I want to know is if there is a better UX approach to allow a user to edit one of the child Addresses in the list p  pMy goals are to find a better approach using ASP.NET MVC thatp  ol liFollow the PRG PostRedirectGet pattern li liDont redirect to a separate PageView for editing, which forces the user to navigate back to the contact edit form againli liAvoid popups because of the blockersli liThe solution allows the use Model Binding and Validation for the Address objectli ol

So basically, with one easy tuple I have the following queryp  precodeSELECT result FROM myTable WHERE keyword LIKE a AND category  A  returns 10,200 as expected codepre  pBut I can have as many tuples as I want. Extending this query for several tuples returns bad resultsp  precodeSELECT result FROM myTable     WHERE  keyword LIKE a AND category  A     AND    keyword LIKE Superman AND category  B  expected 200 but returned no rows...  SELECT distinct result FROM myTable     WHERE  keyword LIKE a AND category  A     OR    NOTkeyword LIKE Superman AND category  B  expected 10 but returned 10,200... codepre  pThats pretty logical because PostgreSQL does not follow the operator order and parenthesis.p  pOnly codeORcode clauses are working. If I had only codeORcode clauses, Id use something like thisp  precodeSELECT result FROM myTable     INNER JOIN VALUES       foo,C,       Superman, B      tkeyword,category USING keyword,category  10,200 as expected codepre  pBut it works only for codeORcode and for strict equality.

Negative 3988 pSorry about the long post, my question is bit difficult to formulate. Im facing a strange behavior when trying to make AJAXcall. In my website I have button, which allows user to delete some data from my database using a REST API call. When I make call directly inside codeltscriptgtcode tags in my htmlfile, everything works as expected. Deletecall is made to address codehttp0.0.0.08080v1itemid1code as expectedp  precodeltscriptgt   removeButton.clickfunctione     bootbox.confirmAre you sure, functionresult      if result  true       .ajax         type DELETE,         async true,         contentType applicationjson,         url v1item  itemID,                 dataType json,                 successfunctionresult                            location.reload         ,         errorfunction           removeButton.notifyError in removing item, error                             else       console.logfalse         ltscriptgt codepre  pHowever, Im trying get rid of most of the javascript code inside the htmlfile and put most of the code to external .jsfiles. When I put that AJAXcall to function inside external jsfile, the AJAX url is somehow duplicated. It tries to make a call to address code0.0.0.08080v1itemhttp0.0.0.08080wwwitemid1code. Correct url should be code0.0.0.08080v1itemid1code. HTMLfile is located in code0.0.0.08080wwwitemid1code. I believe that also this modalview Im using codebootbox.jscode can be source of the problem.p  pHere is the content of the external jsfile buttons.jsp  precodefunction removeConfirmButtonPressed   .ajax     type DELETE,     async true,     contentType applicationjson,     url v1items  itemID,            dataType json,             successfunctionresult                        location.reload     ,     errorfunction       removeButton.notifyError in removing item, error           codepre  pAnd here is the htmlfile      p  precodeltscriptgt   document.readyfunction     event for clicking remove button     removeButton.clickfunctione       bootbox.confirmAre you sure, functionresult        if result  true         removeConfirmButtonPressed              else         console.logfalse                              ltscriptgt codepre  pSo my question is what can cause this strange duplication of the urls when making a AJAXcall from external jsfile, after user confirms his choice is Bootstrap modal viewp

Negative 3988 pI need to build a recommendation system and I want to build it from scratch to practice and get more involved with coding and learning languages. I want to be able to collect user data from a website when user click on links and send that information into a table in the database that would return a set of suggestions according to the links chosen during a given session. Is it even possible to do such thing For example, say I have a Estore that sells all type of different bikes and gearp  pBikesp  ul lipMountain Bikespli lipBMX Bikespli lipTriathlon bicyclespli lipEtc...pli ul  pGearp  ul lipMountain helmetspli lipBMX Helmetspli lipTriathlon Helmetspli lipEtc...pli ul  pNow lets give those categories some IDS 1,2,3,4,5 amp 6 then create a table named coderecommendationsystemcode that would be connected to the codecategorytablecode. p  pAccording to the input inserted into coderecommendationsystemcode the codeServletcode will call the appropriate category from the codecategorytablecode and return a set of products.p  pThe system would make precise guesses with user input.p  pFor instance, there are very good probabilities that a user that picks codeid2 BMX Bikescode as first category will be interested to see suggestions from codeid4 BMX Helmetscode and so on. Its all about directing the user up to the next same products family.p  pSo is it possible to collect those given ids, send them to a database and then display suggestions according to the id that was previously pick Do I need to use some kind of a form or only handle HTTP requestsp

The number of transformed inputs in memory should be batch size code10code above times concurrent work threads codethreadCountcode.p  pSo for 5 threads, we should retain 50 codeTransformcode items at any given time and if, as here, the transform is a 1MB byte buffer, then we would expect memory consumption to be at about 50MB throughout the run.p  pWhat I find is quite different. Namely that Reactive is eagerly consuming all codenumberscode, and codeTransformcode them up front as evidenced by codenumbers exhausted.code message, resulting in a massive memory spike up front 1GB for 1000 codeitemCountcode.p  pstrongMy basic question isstrong Is there a way to achieve what I need ie minimized consumption, throttled by multithreaded batchingp  pstrongUPDATEstrong sorry for reversal James at first, i did not think paulpdaniels and Enigmativitys composition of codeWorkTransformcode applied this has to do with the nature of our actual implementation, which is more complex than the simple scenario provided above, however, after some further experimentation, i may be able to apply the same principles ie defer Transform until batch executes.p

Negative 3988 pI need to write a schema say, A.xsd which uses elements from a second schema say, B.xsd written for a different project.

Thus, a simple import of the A.xsd namespace for the macAddress and other elements does not seem to work for me, since the import causes these elements to be toplevel elements for A.xsd as well.p  pI then tried using the abstracttrue attribute for the toplevel elements in B.xsd, like sop  precodeltxselement namemacAddress abstracttruegt ltxscomplexTypegt     .... ltxscomplexTypegt ltxselementgt codepre  pand then wrote A.xsd as belowp  precodeltxsimport namespaceurnxyzBNamespace           schemaLocationfileCUsersaDocumentsB.xsdgt ltxselement namerootgt ltxscomplexTypegt         ltxssequencegt         ltxselement refBPrefixmacAddressgt lt BPrefix is defined gt     ltxssequencegt    ltxscomplexTypegt ltxselementgt codepre  pHowever, this schema then generates a following error during validation The QName urnxyzBNamespacemacAddress does not resolve to an element declaration.p  pI am unable to understand what this error means.

Yet, since these x points are already used for training a network, is it ok to train the same network with these y data points without any reset and have the effect as if the network is trained using both x and y data points, not to spend time to retrain everything from scratch.

But what if that function has an actual return type, instead of codevoidcode The codespecialDerivedcode class would then have to provide an implementation that returns something. The caller then could assume that the value they got is something meaningful, when its really not, and thats a problem.p  pSimply implementing the virtual function in codespecialDerivedcode with a single codethrowcode in the body could be a solution, as long as some documentation exists that explicitly states that calling this function on objects of this specific derived type has no meaning, and that this operation will throw. I think this is one possible solution, but Im not sure if its the best way to go.p
Negative 3988 pI have 2 divs, a navigation and a main content in a bootstrap grid system. The length of either can vary depending on amount of content.

These codeDIVcodes are filled with data but it occasionally happens, that these codeDIVcodes are empty and in that case they screw up my layout. Now I want to check if the codeDIVcodes are filled with data html and if not, to remove them. I made some codeifcodestatements but Im sure this can be done smoother.p  pHere is my js codep  precodeif .trim.fcol1.html      .fcol1.remove   if.trim.fcol2.html       .fcol2.remove   if.trim.fcol3.html       .fcol3.remove  codepre  pSo, is there a way to shorten this codep
Negative 3988 pI have the situation outlined in the screenshot attached where the IE11 inspector is showing me a style being applied that I cannot figure out where its coming from.p  pIn this a hrefhttpi.imgur.comSs0tonN.png relnofollowscreenshota youll see the inline styles, as expected, and some styles with details on what style sheet and line number they are coming from.p  pHowever, the second style  .cke  visibility hidden   is not inline nor is it attributed to a style sheet.p  pWhere is this style coming from  Ive used grep to search through the source files for this and cant find anything.
