Positive 21030 pAs Ive looked for a way to create an addon, which checks the WoWPvPQueueStatus, for creating a REST service, I was told that its not possible to have a realtime connection between an addon and a REST service. So I was thinking about another way to solve my problem and came to the point, where I thought about analyzing the WoWWindow and searching for a visual pattern to accomplish for what Im looking for.  My program should check and tell me, whenever a user of the program is queuing for an battleground and should also tell me on which battleground heshe is queuing, so I can gather the data and post it to my servicewebsite. I could create some visual feedback with an WoWAddon, for the events Im looking for ... like a signal, which tells my program what to do.p  pSo Id like to know, how I would accomplish to create such signalinterpreter so like an Screen Grabber. I was thinking about OpenCV, but dont know where to start, especially Im kinda curious in how WardenAnti Cheat Engine would interpret such program, I really dont want my users to get banned for such a thing. It should really just interpret visual feedback of the addon Id create.p  pSo for examplep  pIf user queues for Arathi Basin, a yellow signal should pop and if the yellow signal pops up, the program tells my service that player xyz has queued up, which should be displayed later on ... on my homepage in realtime. If the user queues up for Warsong, another signal pops up, etc.p  pIm currently just experienced with C.NET in an early stage and would start a little project with such an service, so what I need to learn to get this thing build upp  pI really just would love to have a little guide on which knowledge I need, to solve this problem.p
Positive 21030 pThe OpenCV library provides a function that returns a set of contours for a binary thresholded image.

Positive 21030 pIm currently working on an augmented reality application using a medical imaging program called 3DSlicer. My application runs as a module within the Slicer environment and is meant to provide the tools necessary to use an external tracking system to augment a camera feed displayed within Slicer. p  pCurrently, everything is configured properly so that all that I have left to do is automate the calculation of the cameras extrinsic matrix, which I decided to do using OpenCVs codesolvePnPcode function. Unfortunately this has been giving me some difficulty as I am not acquiring the correct results.p  pMy tracking system is configured as follows p  ul liThe optical tracker is mounted in such a way that the entire scene can be viewed.li liTracked markers are rigidly attached to a pointer tool, the camera, and a model that we have acquired a virtual representation for.li liThe pointer tools tip was registered using a pivot calibration. This means that any values recorded using the pointer indicate the position of the pointers tip.li liBoth the model and the pointer have 3D virtual representations that augment a live video feed as seen below.li liThe pointer and camera Referred to as C from hereon markers each return a homogeneous transform that describes their position relative to the marker attached to the model Referred to as M from hereon. The models marker, being the origin, does not return any transformation.li ul  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comNnKr7.jpg altDepiction of correctly augmented environment. Extrinsic was manually adjusted to demonstrate process is correct, but is inaccurate.p  pI obtained two sets of points, one 2D and one 3D. The 2D points are the coordinates of a chessboards corners in pixel coordinates while the 3D points are the corresponding world coordinates of those same corners relative to M. These were recorded using openCVs codedetectChessboardCornerscode function for the 2 dimensional points and the pointer for the 3 dimensional. I then transformed the 3D points from M space to C space by multiplying them by C inverse. This was done as the codesolvePnPcode function requires that 3D points be described relative to the world coordinate system of the camera, which in this case is C, not M.p  pOnce all of this was done, I passed in the point sets into codesolvePnpcode. The transformation I got was completely incorrect, though. I am honestly at a loss for what I did wrong. Adding to my confusion is the fact that OpenCV uses a different coordinate format from OpenGL, which is what 3DSlicer is based on. If anyone can provide some assistance in this matter I would be exceptionally grateful. p  pAlso if anything is unclear, please dont hesitate to ask. This is a pretty big project so it was hard for me to distill everything to just the issue at hand. Im wholly expecting that things might get a little confusing for anyone reading this.p  pThank youp  pUPDATE 1 It turns out Im a giant idiot. I recorded colinear points only because I was too impatient to record the entire checkerboard. Of course this meant that there were nearly infinite solutions to the least squares regression as I only locked the solution to 2 dimensions My values are much closer to my ground truth now, and in fact the rotational columns seem correct except that theyre all completely out of order. Im not sure what could cause that, but it seems that my rotation matrix was mirrored across the center column. In addition to that, my translation components are negative when they should be positive, although their magnitudes seem to be correct. So now Ive basically got all the right values in all the wrong order. p

Positive 21030 pSo I am trying to write some code that lets me segment the fuses you see in the picture below. I have come up with two approachesp  p1 Based on color. I threshold using OpenCVs inRange function. This approach works well for all fuses except the brown fuse. The brown fuse it too similar in colour with the fusebox itself and therefore its very hard to segment it out.p  p2 I considered thresholding the image heavily so that I can detect the white pointsterminals on the fuses themselves using OpenCV SimpleBlobDetector. I then filter out the blobs by their distances to each other. As I know the size of the fuses, I can filter out the invalid fuses. This approach works well for all fuses but the white one as it appears in even the most thresholded images.p  pI was hoping I could get a pointer on how to segment such an image.

The plugin is written in JavaScript and WebGL. To this end it works fairly good.p  pI want to extand the application with colortracking and ultimatley object recogniztion. p  pFor now the color detection simply pass the a given color and the camera texture to a shader. The shader converts the texture and color to CIELAB space and checks the euclidean distanceon the A and B axes,Not the luminance component. If it is within the given distance the texture keeps the color, else the fragment is set to black. The result is barely OK.p  pSo my question is, is there a more robust and better way to find these colors I choosed the CIELAB space since it is somewhat invariant to shadows etc.p  pEDIT Seems that the biggest problem is that I use a Guassian Filter to reduce noise in the video image, this leads to a darker image. Even though LAB is, as stated somewhat invariant to shadows etc it makes the detection less efficient. So Im guessing I need a different way to reduce noise in the image.

Positive 21030 pIm attempting to take images of playing cards and extract information about them using some form of template matching. To start off Ive been using Gaussian blurring, gray scale conversion and then thresholding to create a binarised image, and theyve been pretty effective at isolating the card as the only real details in the imagesp  pa hrefhttpimgur.comay1H7F relnofollowhttpimgur.comay1H7Fap  pHowever before proceeding to the next step hopefully using OpenCVs template matching stuff I was struggling with two things firstly, do these images need more processing before template matching For instance, do I need to be looking into accounting for the scale and orientation of the cards Quick note the template I was intending to use was the corner of the card with the rank and suit its in the link above. I conceptually understand that you can potentially select the entire area by finding the four corner with the internal angles, but Im pretty clueless on how to implement that. Secondly is there a particular template matching algorithm that would be best for this type of work Id rather do some more processing prior to template matching rather than brute force matching with multiple types of the same image rotated and scaled to account for the differences in each photo.p  pSo summary do I need to do some more processing for scale and orientation before matching and if so, suggested algorithms, and what template matching algorithm would be the best approach for this problemp  pI think the ideal solution is finding the entire card and forming a separate image where it is scaled and positioned for template matching and then using a matching algorithm, but Im not sure thats even possible Any help is most appreciated.p

Positive 21030 pI am implementing Lowes method, SIFT, for finding and describing features in an image.p  pI have found interest points, and now I have to describe them Using Lowes method, I have calculated the magnitude and gradient in an area around the keypoint, and created a Gauss weighted histogram, with 36 bins, each corresponding to an orientation of 10 degrees. For each keypoint, there is a histogram. Each bin is the sum of the weighted magnitude, in that direction. An example taken from aishack.in a hrefhttpwww.aishack.instaticimgtutsiftorientationhistogram.jpg relnofollowhttpwww.aishack.instaticimgtutsiftorientationhistogram.jpgap  pBins within 80 the size of the maximum bin, is made a new keypoint. After describing, it says in the paper Finally, a parabola is fit to the 3 histogram values closest to each peak to interpolate the peak position for better accuracy. I am not sure i get this. p  pIn my understanding, it means the peak, the left, and the right value of that peak, will have a parabola fit, like thisbe warned Drawn free handp  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.com7V8pb.jpg relnofollowhttpi.stack.imgur.com7V8pb.jpgap  pand the orientation of the keypoint will be where the extremum of the parabola  is. For instance If the parabola fitted at 1019, 2029, and 3039 with 2029 being the histogram peak, had extremum at a point, that reached in the 3039, then this would be the orientation of that keypoint. Am i understanding this correctly In this way, the orientation of the keypoint, can only be within 36 orientationsp  pAnother option Same idea as above, only the histogram is no longer discrete the extremum of the parapola will thus be a continuous value, and this value is assigned to the keypoint.p

Negative 21030 pWhere Im at there is a main system that runs on a big AIX mainframe.  To facility reporting and operations there is nightly dump from the mainframe into SQL Server, such that each of our 50ish clients is in their own database with identical schemas.  This dump takes about 7 hours to finish each night, and theres not really anything we can do about it were stuck with what the application vendor has provided.p  pAfter the dump into sql server we use that to run a number of other daily procedures.  One of those procedures is to import data into a kind of management reporting sandbox table, which combines records from a particularly important table from across the different databases into one table that managers who dont know sql so can use to run adhoc reports without hosing up the rest of the system.  This, again, is a business thing the managers want it, and they have the power to see that we implement it.  p  pThe import process for this table takes a couple hours on its own.  It filters down about 40 million records spread across 50 databases into about 4 million records, and then indexes them on certain columns for searching.  Even at a coupld hours its still less than a third as long as the initial load, but were running out of time for overnight processing, we dont control the  mainframe dump, and we do control this.  So Ive been tasked with looking for ways to improve one the existing procedure.p  pCurrently, the philosophy is that its faster to load all the data from each client database and then index it afterwards in one step.  Also, in the interest of avoiding bogging down other important systems in case it runs long, a couple of the larger clients are set to always run first the main index on the table is by a clientid field.  One other thing were starting to do is load data from a few clients at a time in parallel, rather than each client sequentially.p  pSo my question is, what would be the most efficient way to load this table  Are we right in thinking that indexing later is better  Or should we create the indexes before importing data  Should we be loading the table in index order, to avoid massive reordering of pages, rather than the big clients first  Could loading in parallel make things worse by causing to much disk access all at once or removing our ability to control the order  Any other ideasp  pstrongUpdatestrongbr  Well, something is up.  I was able to do some benchmarking during the day, and there is no difference at all in the load time whether the indexes are created at the beginning or at the end of the operation, but we save the time building the index itself it of course builds nearly instantly with no data in the table.p

For example, a user can register a task with a dead line and the timer could notify a users callback method when the dead line is over.  In most cases, a registered task will be done within a very short amount of time, so most tasks will be canceled e.g. task.cancel or rescheduled to the future e.g. task.rescheduleToLater1, TimeUnit.SECOND.p  pI want to use this timer to detect an idle socket connection e.g. close the connection when no message is received in 10 seconds and write timeout e.g. raise an exception when the write operation is not finished in 30 seconds.  In most cases, the timeout will not occur, client will send a message and the response will be sent unless theres a weird network issue..  p  pI cant use java.util.Timer or java.util.concurrent.ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor because they assume most tasks are supposed to be timed out.  If a task is cancelled, the cancelled task is stored in its internal heap until ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor.purge is called, and its a very expensive operation. ONlogN perhapsp  pIn traditional heaps or priority queues Ive learned in my CS classes, updating the priority of an element was an expensive operation OlogN in many cases because it can only be achieved by removing the element and reinserting it with a new priority value.  Some heaps like Fibonacci heap has O1 time of decreaseKey and min operation, but what I need at least is fast increaseKey and min or decreaseKey and max.p  pDo you know any data structure which is highly optimized for this particular use case  One strategy Im thinking of is just storing all tasks in a hash table and iterating all tasks every second or so, but its not that beautiful.p

Negative 21030 pI apologize that there is a similar question already but Id like to ask it more broadly.p  pIs there any way at all to determine on the client side of a web application if requesting a resource will return a 401 status code and cause the browser to display an ugly authentication dialog p  pOr, is there any way at all to load an mp3 audio resource in flash which fails invisibly in the case of a 401 status code rather than letting the browser show an ugly dialogp  pThe Adobe Air runtime will suppress the authentication if I set the authenticate property of the URLRequest object but this property is not in the Flash runtime. Any solution which works on the client will do. An XMLHttpRequest is not likely to work as the resources in questions will be at different domains.p  pIt is important to fail invisibly because the application will have a list of many audio resources to try and it makes no sense to bother the user to try and authenticate for one when there are many others available. It is important that the solution work on the client because the mp3s in question come from various servers outside my control.p

Negative 21030 pI think Im beginning to be confused with the job of a controller in MVC.p  pI have a service that exposes five functionsp  ul lilist packages in queueli liget packageli lidelete packageli liaccept packageli lideny packageli ul  pMy ASP.NET MVC controller depends on this service, and can generally execute a service call on an Action.  Im happy so far.p  pThe second part is then building the ViewModel result.  If I do this inside of the controller, the controller now has an exploding dependency list  each action added increases the dependencies in order to build the view model, and these are all inherited by the controller.  I dont like this very much.  Im building this controller that depends on N different view model builders, but only using one of them per request.p  pSo I was thinking of pulling all of this out and applying action filters specific to each view model.  I havent done this yet, but it seems okay.p  pThe question this is raising for me is what is the responsibility of the controller  If I end up pulling the view model building into filters, my controller is doing little more than having a route execute a service call and providing a filter plugin.  If I instead leave my controller responsible for building each view model, it becomes a mess.p  pIt seems like I almost want to instantiate an action per request, not a controller, and Im just abusing filters to get at thatp

Negative 21030 pI have some kind of object model and I need to filter and sort its nodes for some kind of property. What kinds of automated systems exist to generate and select properties of the object model that correlate to what I want Im intentionally being abstract and nonspecificp  pIm thinking of a system that works kind of like spam filters or supervised classification systems in that given an example data set it identifies rules that find nodes of interest. However Im looking for a more general system in that it shouldnt require any design time information about the object model. It should work equality well as a spam filter on email, a bug finder on a code base, an interest filter in a newsgroup or bot accounts finder on a social networking site. As long as it can explore the object model via reflection and be given a set of interesting nodes, it should be able to find rules that will find more nodes like them.p

Negative 21030 pIm doing some research for a Maps project Ill be starting soon, and Im trying to evaluate which of the Map APIs will be bestsuited to this project. Ive worked pretty extensively with the Google Maps Javascript API, but no others. My basic requirements are, in no particular orderp  ul liFree as in beer, not necessarily as in speech.li liWebbased Javascript, FlashFlex, Silverlight, etc. are all okay.li liLongrunning and stable the map needs to be able to live in a browser for daysweeksmonths without gradually consuming too much memory or other system resources.li liFast The map absolutely must be able to plot thousands of points upwards of 10k points with ease. Every few seconds I need to be able to update a small number of these say, changing their color.li ul  pOther things Id like to seep  ul liFlexible the Google Maps JS API is a good example of this. Basically this leads to lots of good things like numerous thirdparty pluginsextensions, and puts a lot of power in the devs hands.li liWelldocumented and supported again, the GMap JS API is a good example. If Im going to start working with a new, rich API, Im going to need to be able to find answers.li ul  pAs of now, Im inclined to use the Google Map Javascript API since I am familiar with it. However, the question of whether or not the Flash API might be able to handle many points more efficiently and gracefully prompted this SO question.p  pSo, what have you had good or bad experiences with Based on my criteria, which API would you recommend Im sure there are good ones out there that I just dont know about.p
Negative 21030 pI have an codeEventcode model with a codefinishtimecode field and a form checkbox called codewhenevercode. When codewhenevercode is checked I want to set codefinishtimecode to codenilcode regardless of its value in parameters, when codewhenevercode is not checked I want to make sure that codefinishtimecode is a valid date before I save it in the database.p  phrp  pCurrently I am achieving this using a codewhenevercode attraccessor on Eventp  precodeparams[event][finishtime]  nil if whenever  params[event].deletewhenever event  Event.newparams[event] event.whenever  whenever codepre  pAnd using conditional validations to check for codefinishtimecode if codewhenevercode is codefalsecodep  precodevalidatespresenceof finishtime, unless gt whenever codepre  phrp  pI am not happy with the duplication this creates. The only way that codefinishtimecode can be codenilcode is if codewhenevercode is codetruecode, and if you change one you often have to change the other. If the codeEventcode is updated with a new codefinishtimecode then codewhenevercode will have to be changed to codefalsecode as well.p  pIdeally I would like to move the validation to my controller. That way when doing direct model access codewhenevercode can be easily indicated by setting codefinishtimecode to codenullcode, but users posting to events will get yelled at if they havent indicated a choice. However I cant figure out a way to conditionally add or remove validations to codeEventcode from the controller or even if this is the best approach.p  pWhat is the best way to remove this duplicationp

Negative 21030 pI am working on an application and I have a problem I just cant seem to find a solution for. The application is written in vc. What I need to do is display a YUV video feed with text on top of it. p  pRight now it works correctly by drawing the text in the OnPaint method using GDI and the video on a DirectDraw overlay. I need to get rid of the overlay because it causes to many problems. It wont work on some video cards, vista, 7, etc. p  pI cant figure out a way to complete the same thing in a more compatible way. I can draw the video using DirectDraw with a back buffer and copy it to the primary buffer just fine. The issue here is that the text being drawn in GDI flashes because of the amount of times the video is refreshed. I would really like to keep the code to draw the text intact if possible since it works well. p  pIs there a way to draw the text directly to a DirectDraw buffer or memory buffer or something and then blt it to the back buffer Should I be looking at another method all together The two important OSs are XP and 7. If anyone has any ideas just let me know and I will test them out. Thanks.p

They both have some useful methods such as getLastModifiedDate, getName, getPath and so on. strongBut the difference is that ArchiveFolder can hold an ArrayList of ArchiveFiles and additional ArchiveFoldersstrong think of this as files and folders inside a folder.p  pNow I want to populate my raw input into one emrootem ArchiveFolder, which will have all the files in the root dir of the ZIP in the ArchiveFiles ArrayList and any additional folders in the root dir of the ZIP in the ArchiveFolders ArrayList and this process can continue on like this like a chain reaction more filesfolders in that ArchiveFolder etc etc.p  pSo I came up with the following codep  precodewhile archive.hasMore      String path        ArchiveFolder current  root      String[] contents  archive.getName.split      for int x  0 x lt contents.length x          if x  contents.length  1 ampamp archive.getName.endsWith   If on last item and item is a file              path  contents[x]  Update final path ArchiveFile              file  new ArchiveFilepath, contents[x], archive.getUncompressedSize, archive.getCompressedSize, archive.getModifiedTime, archive.getModifiedDate, archive.getCRC              current.addFilefile  Create and add the file to the current ArchiveFolder                  else if x  contents.length  1   Else if we are on last item and it is a folder             path  contents[x]    Update final path             ArchiveFolder folder  new ArchiveFolderpath, contents[x], archive.getModifiedTime, archive.getModifiedDate              current.addFolderfolder  Create and add this folder to the current ArchiveFile                  else   Else if we are still traversing through the path             path  contents[x]    Update path             ArchiveFolder folder  new ArchiveFolderpath, contents[x]              current.addFolderfolder  Create and add folder remember we do not know the modified datetime as all we know is the path, so we can deduce the name only             current  folder  Update current ArchiveFolder to the newly created one for the next iteration of the for loop                    archive.getNext  codepre  pAssume that emrootem is the root ArchiveFolder initially empty. And that archive.getName returns the name of the current file OR folder in the following fashion file.txt or folder1file2.txt or folder4folder2 this is a empty folder etc. So basically the relative path from the root of the ZIP archive.p  pstrongPleasestrong read through the comments in the above code to familiarize yourself with it. Also assume that the addFolder method in an ArchiveFile, only adds the folder if it doesnt exist already so there are no multiple folders and it also updates the time and date of an existing folder if it is blank ie it was a intermediate folder we only knew the name of, but now we know its details. The code for addFolder is pretty selfexplanitoryp  precodepublic void addFolderArchiveFolder folder      int loc  folders.indexOffolder  folders is the ArrayList containing ArchiveFolders      if loc  1          folders.addfolder          else          ArchiveFolder real  folders.getloc          if real.getTime  null              real.setTimefolder.getTime             real.setDatefolder.getDate                codepre  pSo I cant see anything wrong with the code, it works and after finishing, the root ArchiveFolder contains all the files in the root of the ZIP as I want it to, and it contains all the direcories in the root folder as I want it to. So youd think it works as expected, but no the ArchiveFolders in the root folder dont contain the data inside those child folders, its just a blank folder with no additional files and folders while it does really contain some more filesfolders when viewed in WinZip.p  pAfter debugging using Eclipse, the for loop does iterate through all the files even those not included above, so this led me to believe that there is a problem with this line of the codep  precode            current  folder codepre  pWhat it does is, it updates the current folder used as an intermediate by the loop to the newly added folder. p  pI thought Java passed by reference and thus all new operations and new additions in future ArchiveFiles and ArchiveFolders are automatically updated, and parent ArchiveFolders will be updated accordingly. But that does not appear to be the casep  pI know this is a long ass post and I really hope anyone can help me out with this.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 21030 pemThe title is admittedly not that great. Please forgive my English, this is the best I could think of.emp  pIm writing a python script that will manage email domains and their accounts, and Im also a newby at OOP design. My two related issues arep  ol lithe Domain class must do special work to add and remove accounts, like addingremoving them to the underlying implementationli lihow to manage operations on accounts that must go through their containerli ol  pTo solve the former issue, Id add a factory method to the Domain class thatll build an Account instance in that domain, and a remove emantifactoryem method to handle deletions.p  pFor the latter, this seems to me antioop since what would logically be an operation on an Account e.g., change password that must always reference the containing Domain. It seems to me that I must add a reference back to the Domain to the Account and use that to get data such as the domain name or call methods on the Domain class.p  pCode example element uses data from the container that manages an underlying a hrefhttpwww.qmailwiki.orgVpopmailCommandlineutilities relnofollowVpopmaila systemp  precodeclass Account     def initself, name, password, domain         self.name  name         self.password  password         self.domain  domain     def setpasswordself, password         os.systemvpasswd ss s  self.name, self.domain.name, password         self.password  password  class Domain     def initself, domainname         self.name  domainname         self.accounts       def createaccountself, name, password         os.systemvadduser ss s  name, self.name, password         account  Accountname, password, self         self.accounts[name]  account     def deleteaccountself, name         os.systemvdeluser ss  name, self.name         del self.accounts[name] codepre  pAnother option would be for Account.setpassword to call a Domain method that would do the actual work  which sounds equally ugly to me.p  pAlso note the duplication of data account name also as dict key, it sounds logical account names are primary key inside a domain but accounts need to know their own name.p  pEDIT please note the above code is just a quick example, think of it as pseudo code. It intentionally does not care about error conditions or security issues, and is incomplete in data and methods of the classes peruser spam settings, autoresponders, forwarders, get mailbox size, etc....p  pAlso, this is an example I had at hand, but I think it could be generalized to other different logical structures similar to trees where nodes must know about their children and children must call into parents or upper level ancestors to do things. To me, this sounds logically similar to class inheritance but applied to instances of different types classes linked to each other.p

Negative 21030 pHi there im having problem with language mappings. The way i want it to work is that language is encoded in the url like appnamedemycontrollerwhateverp  pIf you go to appnamemycontrolleraction it should check your session and if there is no session pick language based on browser preference and redirect to the language prefixed site. If you have session then it will display english. English does not have en prefix to make it harder.p  pSo i created mappings like thisp  precodeclass UrlMappings      static mappings           langcontrolleractionid             constraints                  langmatchesplen                               langstorecategory              controller  storeItem             action  index             constraints                  langmatchesplen                               langstore              controller  storeItem             action  index             constraints                  langmatchesplen                                 controlleractionid             langen             constraints                                storecategory              langen             controller  storeItem             action  index                  store              langen             controller  storeItem             action  index                  viewindex       500viewerror       codepre  pIts not fully working and langs are hardcoded just for now. I think i did something wrong. Some of the reverse mappings work but some dont add language.p  pIf i use link tag and pass params[langpl] then it works but if i add params[langpl, page2] then it does not. In the second case both lang and page number become parameters in the query string.

See, the size of the UIImageView is based on the size if its parent view, which layed out in IB, is the size of an iPhone 3G screen.  Sadly, the size of this view when running on an iPhone 4 is the same, despite the fact that the iPhone 4 has twice the resolution as a 3G.  So by scaling the images based on the size of the view, I end up making them lower resolution than they should be on an iPhone 4, and they look kinda crappy.p  pSo the second question is, if there is some benefit to programmatically scaling the images down. how can I take advantage of the extra pixels on an iPhone 4  Clearly I cant go by the size of my view.  p

Negative 21030 pIdeally, what Id like to be able to do is take the name of a time zone and call a function to ask for its corresponding time zone info offset from UTC, DST offset, dates for DST switch, etc. in Linux. However, I cant find any way to do this. The information exists in codeusrsharezoneinfocode in the various binary files there, but I dont know how to read them or if there is a way to get the OS to give you the information in them rather than having to read them in yourself. So, Im looking for a way to get this information. Ideally, there would be a posix function which would do it for you so that it would work on POSIX systems other than Linux, but if there isnt, Id at least like to know the proper way or at least the best way to get the time zone info for an arbitrary time zone in Linux.p

Negative 21030 pIm well into learning Scala now and enjoying it very much I hope to start future projects in it, rather than Java.  What Im enjoying less is the relatively poor IDE support.

E.g. yesterday I couldnt get a fresh install of eclipseplugin to run my tests at all, or even open an editor windowp  pIm considering hopping between EclipseIDEA depending on which suits the task at hand best and more importantly cutting my dependence on the IDE for building and running tests ScalaTest.

Negative 21030 pIm storing a whole bunch of settings for my winforms program in various .settings files.

That is, since there doesnt seem to be a need for a cast, the forms codeSystem.Drawing.Locationcode is directly compatible with the codeSystem.Drawing.Locationcode setting stored in the .settings file. Additionally, if I say codeTimeSpan timeSpan  Settings.Durationcode that also works fine.p  pNow, I have made a large settings form, where the user can adjust various parameters, including the various codeDateTimecode and codeTimeSpancode settings.

Negative 21030 pI am currently trying to animate a card game using an AnimationSet of Translate and Rotate animations. Although I am using setFillAftertrue and see the card visibly move and stay in its new position, the actual position of the ImageView is still at its old location.p  pIn the Google documentation it saysp  pNote Regardless of how your animation may move or resize, the bounds of the View that holds your animation will not automatically adjust to accommodate it. Even so, the animation will still be drawn beyond the bounds of its View and will not be clipped. However, clipping will occur if the animation exceeds the bounds of the parent View.p  pThis means that all of my old onClickListeners, etc are still being associated with the old position rather than the newly updated visual representation, and any new animation applied to the View occur from the initial spot, not the newly located one.p  pWhat is the best way to get the effect that I seek a card sliding from my hand to the center of the screen, which is a different LinearLayout, and then in a later sequence sliding from that spot off the screenp  pI know what I seek is possible as the people at bytesequencing.com have accomplished this smooth animation effect in their android game Hearts free which I discovered in the market.p  pThanksp

Negative 21030 pThe basic question is using data binding what are the ways you can allow the user to select the subclass to do the jobp  pSpecific example. I have a class that accepts a CalculationMethod interface to do the calculation. There are several implementations of CalculationMethod. The GUI developer wants to only use data binding to present the choices to the user.p  pI have taken a few approaches. p  pEasiest is to create a class that returns a listof CalcuationMethod for all the implementations and add a Name property to CalculationMethod for display purposes.p  pExpanding on that I will sometimes create a class that uses reflection to do the same thing finds all the classes that implement CalculationMethod. This way I dont have to remember to add new implementations but it can be bad in web applications it is expensive or environments that dont allow reflection.p  pAt times I have added an enumeration with each enum representing an implementation. There is a factory method that accepts the enumeration and returns the proper implementation. This way the GUI developer can bind to the enumeration. I often do this if the user selection must be persisted in some way.p  pAll the above have advantages and disadvantages. Are there other andor better ways to do thisp  pExample below. The GUI developer would bind the dropdown or whatever to the CalculationOptions.Calculations allowing the user to select. I wont write the other examples because you should get the idea. I would use reflection to get all the classes that inherit CalculatoinTemplate or I would have an enum that represents all the classes that inherit.p  precodePublic Class CalculationTemplate     Public MustOverride Readonly Property Name as string     Public MustOverride Sub Calculate End Class  Public Class CalculationImp1     Public Overrides Sub Calculate     End Sub     Public Overrides Readonly Property Name as String         Get             Return Imp1          End Get     End Property End Class  Public Class CalculationImp2     Public Overrides Sub Calculate     End Sub     Public Overrides Readonly Property Name as String        Get            Return Imp2        End Get     End Property End Class  Public Class CalculationOptions    Public Shared Function Calculations as ListOf CalculationTemplate        Dim lst as New ListOf CalculationTemplate        lst.addnew CalculationImp1        lst.addnew CalculationImp2        Return lst    End Function End Class codepre

Negative 21030 pis it possible to use the .NET Introspection functionality in unit tests In our software Id like to prohibit usage of some operations comparison of enum values since there as a special method for that purpose. I remember that FxCop Static Code Analysis ofers access to the code model by means of Introspection. With it, you can inspect whether some function is used or not. I d like to write a unit test making the same check but Im not sure whether Introspection or something similar is offered to the unit test. Or maybe you have another idea how I could do it.p  pThank you in advancep

Negative 21030 pI have a series of images that I need to display multiple times on both forms via image controls and on worksheets via activeX image controls.  I know that I could keep the files externally and use the codeloadpicturecode method but there is something I want to avoid if possible.p  pI also know I could save and load but again I would rather not use an external file write to perform the task. Ideally, everything will stay embedded and hidden within the file itself.p  pI think there maybe a solution in using the clipboard but I couldnt get the syntax to work.

Negative 21030 pstrongOverviewstrong We have developed an app that allows customers check in using an NFC enabled card with a stationary Nexus S.

Negative 21030 pI am stuck with a minor quantmod problem if anyone can suggest a tweak to my code, Id really appreciate that. I dont know progamming as such maybe thats why I miss the obvious. The problem is arising because codegetSymbolscode takes a string as input e.g. YHOO, but returns just YHOO without quotes as the xts object which holds the data. Also, for market indices, Yahoo includes a caret in the string for the code e.g. GSPC, but quantmod returns plain GSPC as the data object.p  pI am trying to download and save to individual binary files the data of multiple tickers. This is so as to create a work environment which can function from data stored on disk, instead of requiring internet access necessarily.p  pI tried writing the functionp  precodebuildhist lt functionx,start,end    getSymbolsx, fromstart, toend, adjustTRUE      savegetx, file pastex, hist.rda, sep, ascii  FALSE    codepre  pThen usep  precoderequirequantmod tckr lt cYHOO,XLB lapplytckr,buildhist,start19950101,end20111130 codepre  pBut, it errors out at the save command saying object getx not found. If I dont use codegetxcode, the codesavecode command will only save the ticker name as string, so I cant use that. No other version such as codesavenoquotex, filepastex, hist.rda, sep, asciiFALSEcode works either.p  pWhat command should I use so that the ticker data will be saved using the same object name as it is originally returned by quantmod In my code above I havent even tried to tackle the other problem  that of stripping the caret sign from the name if it exists. Any pointers to that would be much appreciated too.p

Negative 21030 pI am creating buttons dynamically for a userbased app. Now I have to tell the new form what text to apply to the buttons via parameters to the form, the form then creates the buttons. Now I have an issue  the events for these buttons What is the best mechanism to get the button click events through. I cannot access the form from the originating form, and I can only pass simple data types and arrays. p  pMy first thought is to use a code to reffer to the appropriate method in a static class  basically, pass an array of ints through with the names of the buttons and their onclick handler calls one method  handleint code  where code is used in a giant switch statement to call the appropriate method.p  pBut I doubt this is the best mechanism. I would prefer to create a listener of some sort that simply listens for button clicks, and should the click be unhandled, determine which button was clicked and manage it from there. p  pI have looked at the observer pattern and I am not entirely convinced this is the best one to follow. The problem is not that there is no solution, the problem is that I want the BEST solution.p  pThis is in C for monodroid  but the impact of this information should be minimal.p  pThanksp

Negative 21030 pI have an UIImageView with a method to change the image it displays. It works fine, if the method is triggered from a touch event received by the UIImageView itself, but the same method fails to update the UIImageView, if called from another object, which triggered the touch event. I have an NSLog call in the method in question and thus can see, that the method is called in both cases. But only in one case I can see the actual change of the image in the other case the view is not updated. When it works, I do not need to setNeedsDisplay or setNeedsLayout, but that is what I tried to fix the problem. Setting needsDisplay and needsLayout in the UIImageView as well as its superview. To no avail. I can see, that the image is actually changed, if I rotate the device, which causes a refresh and I see, that the UIImageView indeed changed.p  pThe superview calls the method eventAtLocation on an OutletCollection using makeObjectsPerformSelectorwithObjectp  pIt sure looks like an embarrassing mistake on my part, but I cant figure it out since hours.

I suspect my Adapter is attempting to redowload each graphic when Im scrolling, but cant get the debugger to hitch on that method to prove it.p  pHere is the key code within the Activityp  precodeOverride     public void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState          super.onCreatesavedInstanceState         setThemeR.style.ThemeBambooZen         this.setContentViewR.layout.twitterlayout          myListView  ListView findViewByIdR.id.TwitterListView                              Remove any existing callbacks to the handler before adding the new handler,            to make absolutely sure we dont get more callback events than we want.                   mHandler.removeCallbacksmUpdateAdapterTask         mHandler.postDelayedmUpdateAdapterTask, 1000  Fire the Handler once, the handler will manage selfcalls                       private Runnable mUpdateAdapterTask  new Runnable             public void run                  try                    Get Twitter Tweets on separate thread Requires Network                                   ArrayListltTweetgt tweets  getTweetsFormula1, 1                                  updateUItweets                   Refresh every 45 seconds  45000                  mHandler.postDelayedthis, 45000                                  catch Exception e                                    e.toString                                               Rebuilds the Tweets on UIThread           public void updateUIArrayListltTweetgt tweets         adapter  new TwitterAdapterthis, R.layout.twitterlistitem, tweets         myListView.setAdapteradapter      codepre  pThe Item Adapter  p  precodepublic class TwitterItemAdapter extends ArrayAdapterltTweetgt       public TwitterItemAdapterContext context, int textViewResourceId          supercontext, textViewResourceId          TODO Autogenerated constructor stub           public static Bitmap getBitmapString bitmapUrl          try              URL url  new URLbitmapUrl             return BitmapFactory.decodeStreamurl.openConnection .getInputStream                   catchException ex return null       codepre  pThe Twitter Adapterp  precodepublic class TwitterAdapter extends ArrayAdapterltTweetgt      private ArrayListltTweetgt tweets      public TwitterAdapterContext context, int textViewResourceId, ArrayListltTweetgt tweets          supercontext, textViewResourceId, tweets         this.tweets  tweets           Override     public View getViewint position, View convertView, ViewGroup parent            View v  convertView         if v  null              LayoutInflater vi  LayoutInflater getContext.getSystemServiceContext.LAYOUTINFLATERSERVICE             v  vi.inflateR.layout.twitterlistitem, null                   Tweet tweet  tweets.getposition         if tweet  null              TextView username  TextView v.findViewByIdR.id.username             TextView message  TextView v.findViewByIdR.id.message             ImageView image  ImageView v.findViewByIdR.id.avatar              if username  null                  username.setTexttweet.username                           ifmessage  null                  message.setTexttweet.message                           ifimage  null                  image.setImageBitmapTwitterItemAdapter.getBitmaptweet.imageurl                                               return v          codepre
Negative 21030 pI have inherited the following CSS for a site, and I cant tell if it does anything useful. It is included as IE specific if the IE version is less than 8. So my guess is its an attempt to handle PNG for IEs lt 8. But whether it really does that I have no idea.p  pIn addition some bots are trying to follow the link codeContent,.replacecode which I think is how theyre reading the line with the codereplacecode in it.

So in the onPause I unregister the accelerometer from the SensorManager.  p  pIt was my hope that in onResume I could reregister the SensorManager, and go about my business.  Obviously it isnt quite working that way.  Ive read the documentation and, honestly, I havent been able to figure out what is going on.p  pCodep  pI declare global variable sensorMgrp  precodeprivate SensorManager sensorMgr codepre  pThen I register it to the accelerometerp  precodesensorMgr  SensorManager getSystemServiceSENSORSERVICE       Detect if device has accelerometer     boolean accelSupported  sensorMgr.registerListenerthis,             SensorManager.SENSORACCELEROMETER,             SensorManager.SENSORDELAYGAME      if accelSupported           No accelerometer on this device         sensorMgr.unregisterListenerthis,                 SensorManager.SENSORACCELEROMETER          sensorMgr.registerListenerthis, SensorManager.SENSORACCELEROMETER,             SensorManager.SENSORDELAYGAME codepre  ponPausep  precodeprotected void onPause      if sensorMgr  null          sensorMgr.unregisterListenerthis,                 SensorManager.SENSORACCELEROMETER         sensorMgr  null          super.onPause  codepre  ponResumep  precodeprotected void onResume      sensorMgr.registerListenerthis, SensorManager.SENSORACCELEROMETER,         SensorManager.SENSORDELAYGAME     super.onResume  codepre  pThe errorp  precode0524 143554.058 EAndroidRuntime16783 java.lang.RuntimeException Unable to resume activity  java.lang.NullPointerException codepre  pI really appreciate any help you guys can give, and thanks in advancep

Negative 21030 pI have a system that modelizes a kind of queuing system, that is composed of these elements p  ul liservices  a service that can be offered to a customerli lidesks  a desk that can offer one or more services. There are several desks, and each can be configured to provide a different subset of services, with or without overlap between the desksli licustomerstickets  a customer comes in, and prints a ticket specifying which service she needsli ul  pThe system is already in place and works fine. It is a realworld system, with tickets distributors that allow customers to request and print tickets, and desks client app to call customers to the desks, and displays to show the customers who goes where.p  pNow a new requirement is a way to approximately predict the waiting time for any given ticket in the queue, and raise an alarm if this waiting time gets too high. p  pWe will have a service duration time that will be collected from usage statistics, for each service. p  pThe prediction does not need to be very precise, the goal is to give the administrator of a site a quick outlook of the situation, a feedback whether everything is flowing smoothly, or if customers are accumulating in the queue and it would be good to open one more desk, or in the contrary, customers are scarce and a desk could be shut. The most important factor is the waiting time for the customers for example it would be ok to have 10 customers waiting if each customers stays at the desk 1 minute, but not if this duration is 10 minutes. p  pThe problematic is that any desk can provide any service without limitations. So a given service can be provided by any number of desks. But in turn each desk can provide any number of services.p  pI tried various approaches  p  pYou could generate a queue that consists exclusively of tickets for services that can be provided by one desk. But then, each ticket in this list might be serviceable by just this desk, or by 5 other desks too...p  pYou could grab a ticket, see which desks are susceptible to service it, and grab all the tickets that can be serviced by any of these desks. Again the problem is that some tickets can be treated by only one desk in the set and others by all of them...p  pI really dont know how to tackle the problem from here. Are there any queuing models that can be used for that kind of heterogenous desks  Any ideas how to modelize this p

Negative 21030 pHas anyone had success using Beeblex to validate inapp purchases  I have an app that is already live in the appstore with inapp purchases enabled and working.  In light of the recent hacking news concerning inapp purchases I am attempting to update it to use Beeblex to validate purchases.  The problem is that Beeblex always returns a result saying that Apple claims the purchase to be invalid.  I am hoping someone on here is successfully using Beeblex and can post a working example.

I basically just cut and pasted their code right off their website, so not sure what I could do differently.p  precode void validatePurchaseOrRestore codepre  pp  precodeThe transaction has been reported as complete for a new purchase of the upgrade.

Negative 21030 pBelow is a youtube video showing the functionality of a textual reference program. The program has embedded technical information in it and lets you navigate through the relevant information by selecting parameters. I happen to have this program and I found out that it uses a Microsoft Access Database to do the sorting and filtering of the information.p  blockquote   pa hrefhttpwww.youtube.comwatchvIok87E1asoY relnofollowhttpwww.youtube.comwatchvIok87E1asoYap blockquote  pIm trying to create a software that does the same thing without all the hassle of creating my own software and linking it to a MS Access database. To do this Im hoping there is some software already out there that has a GUI to build these knowledge databases and filters for them.p  pThe basic mechanism Im trying to achieve is to have a huge list of textual information in the background, and then have checkboxes and drop down menus like in the video to conditionally filter through the entire textual information and pull only the relevant bits and spit them out.p  pFor example, lets use Vehicle Traffic rules.p  ul liIf traffic light is green, go through.li liIf traffic light is red, dont go through.li liIf traffic light is yellow, slow down.li liIf traffic light is green, yellow, or red and there is a live ambulance nearby, slow down and pull over out of the way if possible.li ul  pSo then you would have a drop down menu asking what color the traffic light is. And a checkbox asking if a live ambulance is nearby.p  pIf you select traffic light is Red from the drop down menu, the program would display the Dont go through the intersection message or Stop. Dont go. And the other obvious messages if you selected Green or Yellow.p  pIf the checkbox is ticked indicating a live ambulance is nearby, it doesnt matter what color the traffic light is, you will get the slow down and pull over if possible message.p  pThis becomes useful when you have a ton of information, and instead of having to read hundreds of pages for each time you need to find out what to do, you can filter through it quickly.p

Negative 21030 pI am working on a system that is already broken down into a main service and a UI. The design requires that the UI be interchangeable so obviously the service provides the functionality.p  pThe business of this is running 1 of say 6 possible illustrations or processes. Each illustration is made up of say 30 fields. Depending on the process different fields in the illustration will be editable or prepopulated. p  pI am planning on the service, after being called with some sort of create illustration would be told the nature of the illustration and that the service will provide a skeleton illustration with prepopulated fields and some sort of decoration for the fields that indicate a is the field enabled for the current process. b What the validation is required for that. c if it is a dropdown  what the possible dropdown options are.p  pWhen an illustration is completed by filling in the blanks or what not I pass the completed illustration object back ideally the same type as was originally received. p  pThe solution I have some up with and HATE is a custom type of of string, number, dropdown etc which has a number of properties. I then literally set or unset the disabled fields or what not and return the illustration.  This is cumbersome and results in alot of repeated code. It also means that the returned illustration either uses a different virtually identical class or returns the custom type class with redundant information. In addition to this when the illustration is validated I need to be able to return field specific validation results that say if a field failed and why.p  pId love to use decoration. Presumably using attributes or metadata  but I cant see how to set attributed at run time. Ideally Id have a class containing simple types strings, ints, DateTime etc. Then metadata each of these with the enabled, validation rules etc. Then form the service to GUI it has the meta data, but the return trip to the service is just the data. In addition to this I could meta data the validated illustration with per field successfailure.p  pI guess what this comes down to is can metadata or attributes be tailored at run time and can this information cross the WCF boundary.p  pThank you.p

Given a range of dates, the script will traverse the directory in which the log files are kept, and execute codeoneshotcode once for each file that targets that date there are typically between 50 and 110 or so per day. I am definitely not what you would call a powershell guru by any means, which is what brings me here. p  pWhen taking a closer look, codeInvokeExpressioncode a hrefhttpscreencast.comtL8rpy63fDeeN relnofollowseems to bea starting a separate cmd.exe instance each time its called.  This results in either the splunkd daemon to crash, or for cmd.exe to crash.p  pThat being said, are there better alternatives to using codeInvokeExpressioncode  It appears that my script isnt waiting for each invoked expression to complete before it fires off the next one, and that is causing adverse effects on the server.  Ive read this happens when using codeInvokeExpressioncode to call into external nonconsole applications. In this case, Im calling into splunk.exe to execute the command, so that makes sense.p  pI am considering utilizing the scripting host instead of using codeInvokeExpressioncode, but first wanted to ask the pros here at StackOverflow for some potential alternatives p  pThat being said, has anyone run into a similar problem in the past, and if so what alternative did you go with Alternatively, are there other powershell tools I could use in place of codeInvokeExpressioncode that would not only do the job, but would provide more stable execution Any helpsuggestions are much appreciatedp

Negative 21030 pI have a brief question about the use of culture codes in Visual Basic. What I have is a dropdown menu where someone can select what currency they use in their country. All is great until I have to decide what to do about the Euro lol My thinking is simply to use the current culture that is in their computer, assuming they use Euros. My question if I use a culture code for any nation in the EU that uses Euros example Netherlands within the application for currency appearance purposes, would this work as a generic code to cover any country that uses the Euro I had to refer to a wiki page to tell me which countries didnt use the Euro so I included their specific currencies. The code also saves the desired culture setting when the program starts up again, rather than defaulting to the one on the computer. The code does work. Im just wondering if theres a better way because I dont know if a users current culture is going to be one that uses Euros unless I test it against a list of 17 countries.

I can see how to bind to a simple property, but binding to a collection seems a bit more of a head spinner as I am creating a whole new collection everytime an item string is added.p  pFurthermore, when I load an entirely new model I have to run the NotifyPropertyChanged method on all the properties which doesnt make sense to me.p  pAny guidance is much appreciated.p  precodepublic class MediaCacherConfig  IConfig       public string DatabaseFileName  get set       public ICollectionltstringgt FoldersToScan  get set       public ICollectionltstringgt ExtensionsToIgnore  get set    codepre  pI have a viewmodel codeMediaCacherConfigViewModelcodep  precode    public class MediaCacherConfigViewModel  PropertyChangedBase       private MediaCacherConfig Model  get set       public string DatabaseFileName              get  return Model.DatabaseFileName          set                      Model.DatabaseFileName  value             NotifyOfPropertyChange gt DatabaseFileName                    public BindableCollectionltstringgt FoldersToScan              get                      return new BindableCollectionltstringgtModel.FoldersToScan                  set                      Model.FoldersToScan  value             NotifyOfPropertyChange gt FoldersToScan                    public BindableCollectionltstringgt ExtensionsToIgnore              get                      return new BindableCollectionltstringgtModel.ExtensionsToIgnore                  set                      Model.ExtensionsToIgnore  value             NotifyOfPropertyChange gt ExtensionsToIgnore                     Constructor      public MediaCacherConfigViewModel              LoadSampleConfig            Methods      public void LoadSampleConfig               MediaCacherConfig c  new MediaCacherConfig          string sampleDatabaseFileName  testing.config          Listltstringgt sampleFoldersToScan  new Listltstringgt         sampleFoldersToScan.AddA         sampleFoldersToScan.AddB         sampleFoldersToScan.AddC          Listltstringgt sampleExtensionsToIgnore  new Listltstringgt         sampleExtensionsToIgnore.Addtxt         sampleExtensionsToIgnore.Addmov         sampleExtensionsToIgnore.Adddb         sampleExtensionsToIgnore.Adddat          c.DatabaseFileName  sampleDatabaseFileName         c.FoldersToScan  sampleFoldersToScan         c.ExtensionsToIgnore  sampleExtensionsToIgnore          Model  c          NotifyOfPropertyChange gt DatabaseFileName         NotifyOfPropertyChange gt FoldersToScan         NotifyOfPropertyChange gt ExtensionsToIgnore             public void AddNewFolder              Model.FoldersToScan.Addnew one added         NotifyOfPropertyChange gt FoldersToScan            public void SaveConfig              ConfigTools.ConfigurePath.CombineEnvironment.GetFolderPathEnvironment.SpecialFolder.CommonApplicationData, Cacher, Config          ConfigTools.SaveConfigModel,sampleconfig.txt                         public void LoadConfig              ConfigTools.ConfigurePath.CombineEnvironment.GetFolderPathEnvironment.SpecialFolder.CommonApplicationData, Cacher, Config          MediaCacherConfig m  ConfigTools.LoadConfigltMediaCacherConfiggtsampleconfig.txt as MediaCacherConfig         Model  m           NotifyOfPropertyChange gt DatabaseFileName         NotifyOfPropertyChange gt FoldersToScan         NotifyOfPropertyChange gt ExtensionsToIgnore        codepre  pAnd here is my viewp  precodeltUserControl xClassMediaCacher.Views.MediaCacherConfigView          xmlnshttpschemas.microsoft.comwinfx2006xamlpresentation          xmlnsxhttpschemas.microsoft.comwinfx2006xaml          xmlnsmchttpschemas.openxmlformats.orgmarkupcompatibility2006           xmlnsdhttpschemas.microsoft.comexpressionblend2008           mcIgnorabled           dDesignHeight413 Width300gt ltGrid MinWidth300 MinHeight300 BackgroundLightBlue Margin0,0,0,0gt     ltGrid.RowDefinitionsgt         ltRowDefinition Height409gt         ltRowDefinition Height4gt     ltGrid.RowDefinitionsgt     ltTextBox xNameDatabaseFileName TextWrappingWrap Margin10,64,10,0 HorizontalAlignmentCenter Width280 Height42 VerticalAlignmentTopgt     ltListBox xNameFoldersToScan HorizontalAlignmentLeft Height145 Margin10,111,0,0 VerticalAlignmentTop Width280gt     ltListBox xNameExtensionsToIgnore HorizontalAlignmentLeft Height145 Margin10,261,0,0 VerticalAlignmentTop Width280gt     ltButton xNameAddNewFolder ContentAdd HorizontalAlignmentLeft Margin10,10,0,0 VerticalAlignmentTop Width87 Height49gt     ltButton xNameLoadConfig ContentLoad HorizontalAlignmentLeft Margin102,10,0,0 VerticalAlignmentTop Width96 Height49gt     ltButton xNameSaveConfig ContentSave HorizontalAlignmentLeft Margin203,10,0,0 VerticalAlignmentTop Width87 Height49gt ltGridgt codepre  pp

Please help figure out what changes we can do to the RRTBs to make them faster, or even suggest an alternative to this.p  pstrongProblem 2strongp  pWhen using the Rad TxtDataProvider to fill the RTB, a bottom padding of 1012pxbetween the text and the RTB bottom border is introduced in the RTB which were unable to get rid of by setting the MinHeight attribute. However, if we remove the TxtDataProvider, our MinHeight attribute starts working in the RTB. Any ideas on how to make the extra whitespace go away p  pAny advicehelp would be greatp  pPulkit p

With my current setup at work, I share the same directory with several machines of different architectures. What I want is a way to use these packages from python in the different architectures. If the packages were all pure python, this would be no problem. But the issue is that I have several compiled binaries as shown in the example from Cython and from f2py.p  pIs there a clever way to repackage these binaries so that python in the different systems only imports the relevant binaries Id like to keep the code organised in the same directory.p  pObviously the simplest way would be to duplicate the directory or create another directory of symlinks. But this would mean that when new files are created, Id have to update the symlinks manually. p  pHas anyone bumped into a similar problem, or can suggest a more pythonic approach to this organisation problemp

Before I tried to add the codeScrollViewcode, it was all displaying correctly.  The reason I am trying to add the codeScrollViewcode is because it was too much text and I had to make the font size extremely small to fit everything but it was unreadable because it was so small.  I then decided to make it a codeScrollViewcode and make the text size larger.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comTHsMq.png altenter image description herep  pThat was a lot of writing so hopefully it made sensep

PersonViewModel then exposes an codeObservableCollectionltNicknameViewModelgt NicknameViewModelCollectioncode  which is populated at constructionp  precode        foreach string stringItem in person.PersonNicknames                      var nicknameViewModel  new NicknameViewModelstringItem             this.NicknameViewModelCollection.AddnicknameViewModel          codepre  pWhen a string is added, removed or changed in codePersonViewModel.NicknameViewModelCollectioncode the change is not reflected in the Model collection i.e. codePerson.Nicknamescode. Whenever the user modifies, edits or deletes the string item I need to update the Model collection. I dont understand how the linked answer works or how to apply it to this problem. An example would be amazing... Im just at a loss here.p

Negative 21030 pMy database has been working well for my application before this mysterious problem. I wanted to add an unique index in one table listitems for two columns listid and itemid.

Negative 21030 pim building a php switcher to add strongmultilanguagestrong capability to my site.p  pEvery content in MySQL has a languagespecific text that I want to retrieve according to the active language.p  pAt the beginning, I thought to build a tailored strongtable in MySQL to store the languages statusstrong.br For examplebr ITALIAN 1br ENGLISH 0br ..where 1 means that language is active, and 0 means is off.p  pEvery time the user switch language, I call this table and change the language status. Then, at the end of the call, I refresh the page and php retrieve the right contents.p  pThis seemed a good idea till I figured out that the languages status in MySQL could change every time a user switch. So, if a user is viewing the site in Italian, and other user switch to English at the same time, the first user will view the English as well.p  pMy question is how could I store the languages status for the specific user, avoiding change the languages status for every other user p  pThanks a lotp

Then, I should convert my string, and I want to convert it to the most similar compliant format because it should be easier to convert. But a hrefhttptools.ietf.orghtmlrfc2822page14 relnofollowhttptools.ietf.orghtmlrfc2822page14a is hard to understand, so I dont know which is the most similar format.p  pIs there a list with examples of the allowed formatsp

However if the FB app is installed on my phone it brings up a dialog saying the app would like to access you public profile etc. I press OK and..... nothing.p  pI have found many questions that seem similar but the problem was usually using a debug key as opposed to a release key, but I am running from eclipse so the debug key is still appropriate.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 21030 pI successfully created a iOS static library containing the LRResty API along with many of my own classes, functions etc.  To try testing my library, I copied it over to a new Xcode project along with the libraries header file.  In this new Xcode project I invoked one of my functions that eventually calls the LRResty function [LRRestyClient getwithBlock].  This then throws the exception NSInvalidArguementException unrecognized selector sent to instance.  The interesting thing is that I can rightclick on the function within the static library and Jump to definition and it knows where the function definition lies.  p  pI know this exception can be thrown for many reasons, does anyone know what else it might be  Id be happy to provide more information if this description is too vague.  Or could anyone please explain to me how to package the LRResty library successfully into a iOS static library  I will then use this process to package the rest of my source files within it.  p  pNote Im new to creating static libraries, so it could be something very simple that I overlooked.

Negative 21030 pSome firm is supplied with large wooden panels. These panels are cut to required pieces. To make for example bookshelf, they have to cut pieces from the large panel. In most cases, the pig panel is not used from 100, there will be some loss, some remainder pieces, which can not be used. So to minimize the loss, they have to find optimal layout of separate pieces on big panelpanels. I think this is called two dimensional rectangle bin packing problem.p  pNow it is getting more interesting.p  pNot all panels are the same, they can have slightly different tone. Ideal bookshelf is made from pieces all cut from one panels or multiple panels with same color tone. But bookshelf can be produced in different qualities ideal one one piece with different tone two pieces..., three different color plates used etc.... Each quality has its own price. the superior in quality the more expensive.p  pNow we have some wooden panels in stock and request to some furnitures e.g. 100 bookshelves. The goal is to maximize the profit e.g. create some ones in ideal quality and some in less quality to keep material loss low.p  pHow to solve this problem How to combine it with bin packing problem And hints, papersarticles would be appreciated. I know I can minimizemaximize some function and inequalities with integer linear programming, but I really do not know how to solve this.p  pplease, do not consider the real scenerio, when for example would be the best to create only ideal ones... imagine, that loss from remaining material is X money per cm2 and Y is the price for specific product quality and that X and Y can be arbitraryp

Here is what I triedp  precode                            Download the file             Object obj  null             InputStream input  new BufferedInputStreamurl.openStream             OutputStream output  null             ifobj instanceof Themes             output  new FileOutputStreamsdcardplasmabatterybatterymod.zip             ifobj instanceof Softkeys             output  new FileOutputStreamsdcardplasmasoftkeyssoftkeys.zip              codepre  pNow, when I run the app, nothing downloads. Im assuming I did something wrong, and so the app doesnt know what the output stream is. So, my question is as the title states How do I properly check in one class which class I previously came from. Thanks.p

Negative 21030 pIve been trying to find a way to receive commands from my apps users, and havent been able to find any. Ideally, Id like the user to be able to tag the app or a page in a post or a comment, get a notification and process the command. However, there doesnt appear to be a way to retrieve tags for an application, and no matter what I try for a page, the tags connection is always empty but does return data for my test user account.p  pIs there any way to do this Even with the codereadstreamcode permission, I can only see the posts made by my user, but I dont see the comments left on their friendss pages. p

Negative 21030 pI am a teacher and we are looking at going as paperless as possible.  I learned through searching here and asking a previous question how to use Javascript to validate PDF form responses on an individual basis.  I believe there are ways to validate an entire form prior to submitting it, but I havent found out how to do that yet.  The forms will be actually PDF documents, not web pages.p  pWhat my question is deals with that validation and submission.  Is there a way to use javascript or any other method top  ol livalidate an entire form which would be an entire assignment for a student to complete with a click of the buttonli liWith that same click, submit the answers and score received to, say, a spreadsheet  My class has a website and domain that I can fully modify via cPanel to handle submissions, if I have to somehow set it up there.li ol  pIdeally, I want the submission and score, so students cant validate, change all their answers based on the validation, then submit a perfect assignment.p  pThe alternative would be for students to fill out the form, validate, and have students print out their score.  The only issue that I can see with that is with students reloading the PDF and changing their answers after validation.p  pAny insight or suggestionsp

Negative 21030 pIm coding a caesar cipher in Standrd ML for a class assignment.  Im familiar enough with functional programming to know that a map is probably what I want here.

Expected output from msgEncIBM,1 should be HAL.  However, its HBM, which makes it look like its only operating on the first character.  I thought maybe using explode message as the list parameter for map might be the issue so I triedp  precodefun msgEncmessagestring, keyint string    val msg  explode message  implode map fn x gt chrEncx,key msg   codepre  pbut the REPL barfs on the val, saying  p  p     [autoloading]br [library SMLNJBASISbasis.cm is stable]br [autoloading done]br val chrEnc  fn  char  int  charbr    val chrDec  fn  char  int  charbr    stdIn27.2 Error syntax error found at VAL  p  pNot sure what Im missing, my assumption is that Im misunderstanding the syntax or usage of map.

Negative 21030 pIn my MVC view model, I have a table, inside a form. p  pFrom my javascript, Im invoking my controller as follows p  precode.ajax              type POST,         url Url.ActionReorderClues, Clues, Model,         data JSON.stringifypositions,         contentTypeapplicationjson      codepre  pAnd my controller signature is as follows p  precodepublic ActionResult ReorderCluesTreasureHuntDetails treasureHuntDetails, int[] ids codepre  pWhat I find is that when the javascript invokes the controller in this way, the data model the TreasureHuntDetails object is populated with only the treasureHuntId, and everything else is null. The second parameter, the ids array populates successfully  this is the one that I use JSON.stringify on in the ajax function. p  pI cant figure out why everything else is null apart from the treasureHuntId. In the form, I have a HiddenFor line for every property of the object, like this p  precode        Html.HiddenForm gt m.CompletionMessage         Html.HiddenForm gt m.Description         Html.HiddenForm gt m.Clues         Html.HiddenForm gt m.Leaderboard         Html.HiddenForm gt m.TreasureHuntId         etc. codepre  pI dont see whats special about the TreasureHuntId variable that it is the only one whose value is the only populated one on the object which reaches the controller. Any ideas What could I be doing wrong p  pWhen I invoke the controller the normal way with just the data model TreasureHuntDetails, everything gets populated properly, so its only in the javascript where Im also adding on the Ids array the positions variable in the javascript code snippet is an integer array. p

Negative 21030 pI have a client that connects to an NFS server and writes data. It is a multiprocess application that creates as many TCP connections as there are processes.  The problem is that if I try one process, the socket blocks on write very little that is poll does not pause.  If I increase the number of processes to 8 or more, I find myself being blocked by poll on each socket about 30 of the time.  Isnt the purpose of using multiple TCP streams having independent sendreceive buffers and so they should not block like this  Why is having multiple streams interfering with each other  The link is far from saturation as tested with iperf.  p  pMy thoughts on this are that the NFS server will create a socket per TCP connection, and they will have their own receive buffers.  I know Im making separate TCP sockets for each process, so they should have their own send buffers.  If Im not saturating the link, why are the sockets blockingp

I cannot seem to get this to work, the only way I have been able to get my view to refresh is to call ko.applyBindings again in the success call back from my .ajax call. Here is the offending code.p  precodeltscript typetextjavascriptgt     var viewModel      document.readyfunction          panelbar.kendoPanelBar             expandMode multiple                   .ajax             type GET,             url HomeIsUserMarketingManager,             success function data                  if data  true                      submitNewCase.hide                     approveCase.show                     disapproveCase.show                                                  Generate client View Model from Server View Model         viewModel  new ViewModel         ko.mapping.fromJSHtml.RawJson.EncodeModel,, viewModel         ko.applyBindingsviewModel           function ViewModel           var self  this          self.addLocation  function              self.AdditionalLocations.push GaNumber                 ltscriptgt codepre  pAnd later this to update the form with retrieved datap  precodeltscript typetextjavascriptgt     btnImport.clickfunction       .blockUI message lth2gtImporting Client Information...lth2gt ltimg srcImagesajaxloader.gifgtltbr gt      .ajax         type post,         url HomeImportClientCrmInfoJson,         dataType json,         data ko.mapping.toJSviewModel,         success function data              .unblockUI             if data.AccountNull                  ko.mapping.fromJSdata, , viewModel              else                  alertCould not find account for this GA Number, please try again.                             ltscriptgt codepre  pWhen submitting the form to my controller, all the data is there and mapped correctly to my server side View Model, but the form in the view isnt updated with the data that comes back from the .ajax call.

Negative 21030 pA C program P1 creates ofstream on a nonexistent file using iosapp. It then writes a few strings no n in them but does not use endl so buffer is not flushed. It then waits 2 seconds and closes the file.p  pProgram P2 is the same as P1, except it has no wait. I was expecting P1 to overwrite whatever P2 wrote in the file because its buffer is flushed after 2 seconds, but that is not the case. Output of P2 appears properly, followed by output of P1 in the file. p  pAfter many such experiments, it appears to me that the app mode flushes the buffer after each write even though endl was not used. I would like to know if others have faced similar situation, and if my conclusion is correct. Thanks in advanced.p

Negative 21030 pIve been playing with CompletionStageCompletableFuture in Java 8 in order to do asynchronous processing, which works quite well. However, sometimes I want a stage to perform asynchronous processing of an iteratorstream of items, and there doesnt seem to be a way to do this.p  pSpecifically, Stream.forEach has the semantics that after the call all items have been processed. I would want the same thing, but with a CompletionStage instead, e.g.p  precodeCompletionStageltVoidgt done  stream.forEach... done.thenRun... codepre  pIf the Stream is backed by an asynchronous streaming result this would be much better than waiting for it to be complete in the above code itself.p  pIs it possible to construct this with current Java 8 API somehow Workaroundsp

Negative 21030 pIve started using BEM methodology to decouple my HTML and CSS ... and it works pretty well most of the time. Even if its only your personal opinion, i would still like to know how others deal with thisp  pLets assume we need to build a simple navigation. The HTML looks similar top  precodeltnav classnavgt     ltul classnavlistgt         ltli classnavitemgt             lta classnavlink hrefgtltagt         ltligt         ltli classnavitemgt             lta classnavlink hrefgtltagt         ltligt     ltulgt ltnavgt codepre  pIm not sure if i need the .navemitem and .navemlink or if its better pratice to use this insteadp  precode.navlist gt li  CODE  codepre  pBut my real issue is how to deal with active classes not just for navigations, but in general. Is it better to use specific active classes like .navemitemactive, so you can just use a single class inside your CSS file or if using more general class names like .isactive works better But then you need to specify your classes inside your CSS file like .navemitem.isactive or which looks even worse to me .navlist  .isactive.p  pEvery method has its downsides. To me the second way looks wrong if using BEM, but if you are going for the first way you run into troubles with your JS, because you need to hardcode the specific class name into your JSp  precodesomeElement.addClass.navitemactive codepre  pThat way your JS relies too much on your HTML structure or doesnt this matter too much, which might change... And this leads to the second question. I heard that its good to decouple not only your HTML and CSS but also your HTML and JS. So you could for example use those .js classes to add click events and all that kind of stuff to elements instead of using your styling classes to trigger those kind of events. So instead of usingp  precodeltbutton classbtn btnlargegtltbuttongt  .btnlarge in jQuery codepre  pyou would havep  precodeltbutton classbtn btnlarge jsdostuffgtltbuttongt  .jsdostuff in jQuery codepre  pI think this in combination with HTML5 dataattributes works for pretty much for anything, but im asking myself what happens to navigation or accordions or stuff like that. Is it better for maintainability to use those .js classes as well for every itemp  precodeltnav classnavgt     ltul classnavlistgt         ltli classnavitem jsopensubnavgt             lta classnavlink hrefgtltagt             ltul classnavsubgt                 lt ... gt             ltulgt         ltligt     ltulgt ltnavgt codepre  por should i use .navitem... in my JS in this case But that way you dont really decouple your HTML and JS at least as far i understood this topic. Its not just about navigations, but about all those kind of javascript interactions, like accordions, sliders and so on.p  pIll hope you guys can share some best practices for those questions and help me out.p  pThanksp

Negative 21030 pImagine I have a server that is running Node.JS server software does not matter here, what matters is the fact that we have JS as our backend code.

Normally data looks like thisp  precodefruits [0 apple, 1 orange, 2 pear], colors [0 red, 1 blue, 2 orange] codepre  pHere, all data is dynamically codepushcode added to arrays on client side.

Negative 21030 pMy research is about find a shortest path between an origin and a destination predefined. Both origin and destination were located using the GIS extension, because they were obtained by a shape file. I used the command ask patches gisintersecting shapefile to create a person in an origin and a school in the destination. I have 10 origins and for each I have a specify destination. I noticed that when I use the Dijsktras algorithm to find the shortest path, for certain origin the destination isnt the respective point but the closest destination. So, my doubt is Is the Dijsktras the best algorithm for my problem or I need to use the A algorithm If the Dijsktras algorithm is the best, how do I inform the pairs origin and destination in the code If the A algorithm is the best, how do I construct the code in the version 5.0 of Netlogop

Negative 21030 pI was going through the  javadocs and source code for drainTo method present in BlockingQueue interface and LinkedBlockingQueue implementation of the same. My understanding of this method after looking at the source JDK7, is that the calling thread actually submits a Collection and afterwards acquires a takeLock, which blocks other consumers. After that till the count of max elements, the items of the nodes are removed from the queue and put in a collection.p  pWhat I could appreciate is that it saves the threads from acquiring locks again and again, but  pardon my limited knowledge, I could not appreciate the need for the same in real world examples. Could some one please share some real world examples where drainTo behavior is observable p

Negative 21030 pI know very little about multithreading, but I am working with someone elses code and need some help as the original programmer is no longer around. p  pThe program has its own exe to run it but the DLL attaches to the process of another program via APIENTRY WINAPI ... When the DLL attaches to the process, it creates a couple mutex. The problem is that one of these mutex should only be created once and should be accessible by each process. I cant seem to stop each process from creating its own handle. At the very least, during some operation, I need to be able to pass the handle to the other processes or get each handle from each process and apply the same operation basically to sync some of the variables. Ive tried the old static bool isFirst approach, but each process seems to create a new set of variables so it doesnt work. p  pI am really confused and frustrated. Any thoughts or ideas would be highly appreciated.p

Negative 21030 pThrough various resources I found that you can create custom descriptions and even custom object summaries in LLDB. Im also aware that I can do Add Expression in order to display the value of a property for a Apple framework class that the debugger hides from us. p  pstrongWhat I want is to display the framework class object as if the source code were available for it.strongp  pA picture says more than words ... what I have so farp  hr  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com1UmF8.png altenter image description herep  hr  pAs you can see I have a codeSKLabelNodecode named codelabelcode in scope. I managed to add a custom summary string these are words next to codeSKNodecode via Phython scripting following the tutorials a hrefhttpstavash.wordpress.com20130106advancedissuescreatingcustomlldbobjectsummaries relnofollowherea and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions16856353howtoshowobjectivecdescriptioninxcodeherea.p  pI can also see the codelabel.fontNamecode and codelabel.textcode but thats only because I rightclicked and did Add Expression manually for each property.p  pstrongMy questionsstrongp  ol lipIs it possible and if so how to add an objects properties to its tree view via Python LLDB scripts What I want is the codelabelcode object to expand and then always display its codefontNamecode, codetextcode a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosdocumentationSpriteKitReferenceSKLabelNodeRefReferenceReference.html relnofollowand other propertiesa like I have done by manually adding the expressions. Or in other words it ought to behave as if full source code were available for that class.pli lipAlternatively Is there a way to run Add Expression from the script so that I can create an alias that will quickly add multiple expressions Perhaps one where I can add the object in question as a reference, for example codecommand addCustomExpressionsWithObject labelcode.pli ol  pI accept alternative solutions as well. For example if I could write proxy classes for each SKNode class and somehow get LLDB to display the contents of a nodes corresponding proxy class, that would also work. Whatever gets the job done, and preferably in a way thats automated once implemented.p  hr  pIn general, how hard can it be to have the LLDB debugger display the documented properties of a class from an Apple framework p  pIn particular for Sprite Kit we get no info on any SKNode object whatsoever and I cant believe this hasnt bugged other developers using other Apple frameworks as hard as it bugs me. I hope theres a way to fix this but the little info I can find makes me think its either not possible or Im insane for wanting to see more details about Apple class objects.p  pstrongPSstrong Yes, Ive also looked into and customized Xcode 5.1s strongQuickLookstrong functionality. I created a a hrefhttpsgithub.comKoboldKitSpriteKitQuickLook relnofollowSpriteKitQuickLook repository with QuickLookdebugDescriptionsa for some Sprite Kit classes but its still not satisfactory as it serves only as a full class dump better than nothing though.p

Negative 21030 pIm developing a library in C in order to give to developers an help to some tasks. Usually, in order to calculate the size of an array of integer for example in a dynamic way without use define SIZE or static int SIZE, I do sizeofv  sizeofint. Im trying to write a piece of code that can do for me that stuff automatically and I decided to call if lengthof. The code is herep  precodetemplate ltclass Tgt int typesizeT  return sizeofT  define lengthofx sizeofx  typesizeampx codepre  pI use the template to get the type of the array, then I return its size in bytes. In GCC I know that its possible to use typeof, so I can replace typesizeampx with sizeoftypeofx, but its not possible on MSVC. typesize is a compatible way, but I think that it can be expensive because it passes the pointer as copy. There is an elegant way to do thisp

Negative 21030 pI regularly have cause to lookup some key in a map and then lookup the result in another map and so on in an arbitrary chain and am seeking to generalise the process. I also want to be able precompute lists of maps for this purpose to represent reusable chains of association in an AI project.p  pThe obvious solution seems to be a simple extension of a map function over lists that I call maybemap.p  precodelet rec maybemap operation initialvalue list    match list with    []          gt Someinitialvalue    firstrest gt     match operation initialvalue first with      None                   gt None      Somesubsequentvalue gt maybemap operation subsequentvalue rest  codepre  pThe following is an example of its use.p  precodelet employeedepartment  Map.ofList[John, Sales  Bob,    IT    ] let departmentcountry   Map.ofList[IT,   USA    Sales,  France] let countrycurrency     Map.ofList[USA,  Dollar France, Euro  ]  let result  maybemap Map.tryFind John [employeedepartment departmentcountry countrycurrency] codepre  pThis works fine and yields the result SomeEuro. The problem comes when I need to use data in which the domain and range types of the maps differ. For example if I add an exchange rate map to the above example the type checker complains even though none of the individual operations involved would fail.p  precodelet exchangerate  Map.ofList[Euro, 1.08 Dollar, 1.2]  let result1  maybemap Map.tryFind John [employeedepartment departmentcountry countrycurrency exchangerate] codepre  pThe type checker complains that exchangerate is expected to be of type Mapltstring,stringgt despite the fact that the following applications of Map.tryFind are both valid.p  precodelet result2  Map.tryFind John employeedepartment let result3  Map.tryFind Euro exchangerate codepre  pIf I were doing this in C it seems that it would be relatively straightforward to define maybemap over over data of type DictionaryltIComparable, IComparablegt and clearly any Duck Typed language would have no problem, but I cannot see how to do this in F.p  pA reference to solving this kind of problem that seems to come up quite often is a hrefhttpcodebetter.commatthewpodwysocki20090128muchadoaboutmonadsmaybeedition relnofollowhttpcodebetter.commatthewpodwysocki20090128muchadoaboutmonadsmaybeeditiona which follows an approach based on monads. In fact, the data used in the examples here are taken from this article. However, despite the fact that using monads to do something this simple seems like using a sledgehammer to crack a nut, the solution given in the article also breaks down when the domain and range types of the maps differ.p  pDoes anyone know how I can make progress with this without introducing significant extra complexity to what seems conceptually very straightforwardp  pstrongEpilogstrongp  pAfter considering the very helpful input received as a result of this question, this is what we decided to go with.p  precodeclass chainable    protected DictionaryltIComparable, IComparablegt items  new DictionaryltIComparable,IComparablegt    public chainable     public chainableparams pair[] pairs  foreach pair p in pairs items.Addp.key, p.value     public void addIComparable key, IComparable value  items.Addkey, value     public IComparable lookupIComparable key  if items.ContainsKeykey return items[key] else return null     public static Listltchainablegt chainparams chainable[] chainables  return new Listltchainablegtchainables     public static IComparable lookupIComparable key, Listltchainablegt chain        IComparable value  key     foreach chainable link in chain  value  link.lookupvalue if value  null return null      return value     codepre  pThe first line of this class is virtually a specification of what is required and the rest of the operations follow straightforwardly from it. p  precodechainable employeedepartment  new chainablenew pairJohn, Sales , new pairBob,    IT     chainable departmentcountry   new chainablenew pairIT,   USA   , new pairSales,  France chainable countrycurrency     new chainablenew pairUSA,  Dollar, new pairFrance, Euro   chainable exchangerate        new chainablenew pairEuro, 1.08    , new pairDollar, 1.2      Listltchainablegt chain  chainable.chainemployeedepartment, departmentcountry, countrycurrency, exchangerate IComparable result     chainable.lookupJohn, chain codepre  pAdmittedly the chainable class could be constructed in F, but that would just be writing C using F syntax so we have decided to cutout the middle man.

Negative 21030 pI have recently started using GXT 3.0.1 and Im trying to edit a grid where values entered into each column can affect other columns and data must be validated.

So lets say I update cell A, then cell B should update to reflect this value. Similarly for editing cell B, then cell A should update.  As well as this, I need to validate my changes before submitting.p  pGridInlineEditing  CompleteEditEvent fires each time tab is pressed and I can work out which values have changed based on storing previous value and lookng at Store.Record.getChange, so this works.

Negative 21030 pThis is my first question here so thanks to anyone being able to help.p  pLet me explain the problembr I have an applet that uploads a file by chunks to a servlet.br One of the arguments of the applet is the JSESSIONID so it can create a cookie and identify the correct session at the server tested with iwiresharki.br For each chunk sent, the servlet is obtaining the session successfuly.brp  pThe problem is that, during the upload, the session do not seem to get its live extended. If I configure at the aplication web.xml the session timeout to 5 minutes, then the file has to be uploaded in less than that time or the session will be destroyed and the upload will fail.br It is weird because the servlet is executing every few seconds and accepting the session id, I am lost.brp  pThis is the argument at the web.xmlp  precodeltsessionconfiggtltsessiontimeoutgt5ltsessiontimeoutgtltsessionconfiggt codepre  pThe next code at the servlet create logs every few seconds for each chunk tracing session id successfulyp  precodelog.infoisRequestedSessionIdValidgt   servletRequest.isRequestedSessionIdValid log.infogetSessiongt   servletRequest.getSessionfalse  null log.infoRequested session ID vs. actual session id   servletRequest.getRequestedSessionId    servletRequest.getSessionfalse.getId codepre  pI am using tomcat 7.0.50 as servlet container configured in a cluster with session replication and an apache 2 as frontend with sticky session active.p  pThanks in advance for your help.p  pRegards, Josp
Negative 21030 pI have this platform which you can login and do your tests this is a test link www.mf.pt.lap  pI cant understand why this isnt working... first I tried this on top of my config.php filep  precodeinisetsession.cookielifetime, 864000 inisetsession.gcmaxlifetime, 864000 codepre  pThan I tried this with a cookiep  precodeyear  time  31536000 ifPOST[remember]1      setcookierememberme, SESSION[LOGINUSER], year  elseifPOST[remember]       ifissetCOOKIE[rememberme]               tendays  time  864000         setcookierememberme, SESSION[LOGINUSER], tendays       codepre  pNone seem to work because after 30mins1h user is logged out p  pThis is very frustrating because inside this website users are usually getting in a out more than once per day, and having always to login is making me lose users actually p  pstrongEDIT 1strongp  pOk, so lets see where we are at this point.p  pAfter a lot of tests, I have noticed the problem was that I was trying to save an array directly into the cookie and it doesnt work like that. I have searched a lot and created a very simple cookie with name test and content text and it worked, so if what was working I did created a cookiep  pThen I searched for a way to put it working all together on the same cookie instead of save one cookie for each information I needed.p  pSo this is the conclusion. To create the cookie, this is what Ive madep  precodecookiename  rememberme userinfo  SESSION[LOGINUSER][userid]..SESSION[LOGINUSER][usertype]..SESSION[LOGINUSER][name]..SESSION[LOGINUSER][email] ifPOST[remember]1     setcookiecookiename, userinfo, time  31536000,  else     setcookiecookiename, userinfo, time  864000,   codepre  pAnd to call the cookie this is what I have madep  precodeifissetCOOKIE[rememberme]      usercookie  explode,COOKIE[rememberme]     SESSION[LOGINUSER][userid]  usercookie[0]     SESSION[LOGINUSER][usertype]  usercookie[1]     SESSION[LOGINUSER][name]  usercookie[2]     SESSION[LOGINUSER][email]  usercookie[3]  codepre  pSo far, it seems to work, but... lets see if in some more hours the login is done automatically after I enter the website again.p  pstrongEDIT 2strongp  pJust noticed that spaces are saved into cookie as  and  as 40p  pstrongEDIT 3strongp  pFINALLY I did it and heres what I did in order to help future usersp  pFirst, lets start by creating the cookie. I inserted a new colum in my users table to save a token, and assigned that token as an encription in MD5 to a variable, like thisp  precodetokenuser  md5uniqidrand, true codepre  pOnce the table was updated, we must create the cookie, and here it isp  precodecookiename  mfrm ifPOST[remember]1     setcookiecookiename, tokenuser, time  31536000,  else     setcookiecookiename, tokenuser, time  864000,   codepre  pFor those who didnt understood that if condition, thats simply to check if the user have selected the checkbox in order to be remembered forever one year in this case.p  pSo far so good, the next part was the one that was try and error until I finally did it You should put this code BEFORE your headers, because otherwise it might not work and will probably give you an errorp  precodeifissetCOOKIE[mfrm]      usercookie  COOKIE[mfrm]  codepre  pSo, this way your variable usercookie now has the content of your cookie the unique token we created.p  pLater on your code, you simply do a call to your database, check for which user that token is valid and then just asign userid and all other things you want in order for user to have his login. p  pI hope whoever sees this can solve the problem, I did a LOT of Google search before I finally get this working.p  pMy suggestion is, do a lot of print and echo in PHP so you can see where is your problem, if needed stop your code by inserting sleep2 where 2 means two secondsp  pGood luck p

The app is quite complex so just a snippet herep  pre      this.schema           xName               title  i18n.tx.name     i18n.tx.namemsg,             type  Text,             validators  [                                      type  required,                     message  i18n.tx.namerequiredmsg                 ,                                       type  regexp,                      regexp  .3,,                      message  i18n.tx.nametooShortmsg                              ],         ,      ...          selectY               title  i18n.tY.project,             type  Select,             options  this.getSomeOptions is defined and works well               and so on ...   pre  pNow it is quite obvious, that you cannot add just a style attribute to selectY in order to differntiate between its options ans style them. E.g. from the backboneforms docsp  blockquote   pfieldAttrsp      pA map of attributes to add to the field, e.g.  style background   red, title Tooltip help p blockquote  pIn our or any schema you can define codenamecode and codelabelcode for the options. Do you see any other possibility than using jQuery in a dirty hack whenon rendering or, more specific showing the form field Any suggestion would be appreciated.p

Negative 21030 pstrongWhat I am trying to dostrongp  pI am converting an existing code base which uses dynamiccasting to identify the derived class shape to apply derived class specific processing, to a scheme which is based on the visitor pattern. To this effect, I have added a processMe method to the base class virtual and in each derived class and a handleShape method to a ShapeProcessor class, one for each type of shape to be processed, typical of the visitor pattern. I have a ShapeProcessor abstract base class that has one pure virtual method that forces the user to provide a catch all shape processor and allows the user to derive from the ShapeProcessor and add other shape processing methods as desired e.g. MyShapeProcessor  public ShapeProcessorp  pstrongObservationstrongp  pHowever what find is that only the catch all method gets called in MyShapeProcessor for all shapes, my shape specific methods are not getting called. What do I need to do to get the shape specific methods to get called as desired Caveat If I put all handler methods in one class, it works fine. Does this mean that it is not possible to overload methods in the base class I have read the posts on name hiding, but that does not seem to apply here. Or does it I tried to unhide the base class method using using but does not seem to help.p  pHere is the pseudo code examplep  precodeclass Shape      virtual void processMe ShapeProcessor  sp          spgtprocessShape this    User derived shape class Circle  public Shape      void processMe ShapeProcessor  sp          spgtprocessShape this    Base ShapeProcessor class ShapeProcessor      virtual void processShape Shapeamp shape  0  User must provide a catch all method    User provided shape processor class MyShapeProcessor  public ShapeProcessor      void processShape Circleamp circle          Never gets called, even for Circle objects          void processShape Shapeamp shape          Always gets called for all shapes        cout ltlt Unsupported shape ltlt endl         User code Circle  circle  new Circle MyShapeProcessor  sp  new MyShapeProcessor circlegtprocessMe sp     Expecting processMe to eventually call MyShapeProcessor processShape Circle but calls processShape Shape   Caveat If I get rid of the ShapeProcessor base class and if I put all shape handles in a single class  it works fine.

Negative 21030 pMy app is portraitonly except one view controller a fullscreen image viewer which is presented modally using a custom transition animation.p  pIt all works fine on iOS 7 and 8 as long as the app is built against the iOS 7 SDK. When I compile against iOS 8 SDK, I encounter an interface rotation problem running on iOS 8 When the image viewer is rotated to landscape and then dismissed, the layout of the presenting view controller is broken. Its back to portrait but with landscape dimensions. So the bottom part of the screen is black.p  pWhat could be the reason Currently, Im only using the iOS 7 interface orientation methods such as codesupportedInterfaceOrientationscode, codeshouldAutorotatecode and codewillRotateToInterfaceOrientationdurationcode. Since I still need iOS 7 compatibility I didnt switch to the iOS 8 style orientation methods yet.p

Negative 21030 pI want to build a Captive portal and an access point on a Ubuntu machine and redirect every incoming traffic to localhost.

All this through iptables as shown below.p  precodeIPTABLES t nat A PREROUTING p tcp dport 065535 j DNAT todestination 192.168.6.180 IPTABLES t filter A FORWARD p tcp dport 065535 j DROP IPTABLES t nat A POSTROUTING o wlan0 j MASQUERADE codepre  pWhen a client such as iPhone connects to the access point, opens up safari browser and enters any URL it is successfully redirected to login page but not any google search from the address barp  pThe place I am struck is forcing an auto browser pop up from iOS device when it connects to my access point. I know it tries to ping apple.com and some others like codewww.apple.comlibrarytestsuccess.htmlcode for success response on connecting and if theres no desired response it opens up a miniature pop up browser. But I already blocked every traffic and redirected to login pagecaptive portal.p  pThe places I think I am going wrong is maybe I should not block all the tcp ports, only some like 80 and 443, maybe I should block some UDP traffic. Is there something I should also alter in my login page. I read somewhere that iOS only pops up a browser when it gets a wispr XML response from the redirected URL.p  pAny help in this regard would be beneficial. I promise I would write a detailed blog post once this gets done.  p

Negative 21030 pI made a twoline change of code yesterday regarding Paramiko that should not in so far as I can tell have had any adverse effect, and immediately our phones started ringing and emails came in of reports of users unable to access to their NFS mounted home directories which are zfs filesystems.  I asked my colleagues for their opinion and everyone is stumped regarding why this change would have not only failed to accomplish what I set out to do, but also why it went so far as to hose everything for everybody.p  pAfter using Paramiko to execute a zfs create command to create a new users NFS home directory, I was using a time.sleep5 line of Python to give the remote system a chance to execute and process the command sometimes particularly if the NFS server is under stress, it can take a second or two for the command to actually take effect.p  pTurns out, we seem to have hit a rare case where a 5 second delay wasnt enough.  So I decided to instead change it from a Python time.sleep5 function, to instead use Paramikos channel.recvexitstatus function to wait for an exit status code, that way the amount of time taken is however much is required not some arbitrary number of seconds.p  pHeres the difference in code excised to reduce mundane stuff like determining zfs paths and usernames, etc.p  pstrongORIGINAL VERSIONstrongp  precodessh  paramiko.SSHClient ssh.setmissinghostkeypolicyparamiko.AutoAddPolicy ssh.connecthomedirserver.example.com   Create zfs share command  zfs create 01.formatzfsparent, username ssh.execcommandcommand  time.sleep5   Confirm creation this can fail without a time.sleep delay above command  zfs list H 01.formatzfsparent, username stdin, stdout, stderr  ssh.execcommandcommand error  stderr.read.strip if error        log error, raise RuntimeError codepre  pstrongNEW VERSIONstrongp  precodessh  paramiko.SSHClient ssh.setmissinghostkeypolicyparamiko.AutoAddPolicy ssh.connecthomedirserver.example.com   Create zfs share command  zfs create 01.formatzfsparent, username stdin, stdout, stderr  ssh.execcommandcommand   lt CHANGED status  stdout.channel.recvexitstatus           lt NEW   Confirm creation command  zfs list H 01.formatzfsparent, username stdin, stdout, stderr  ssh.execcommandcommand error  stderr.read.strip if error        log error, raise RuntimeError codepre  pIt seems that when doing this, the zfs create command exists as a process on the file server and never completes.  codeps eaf  grep zfs createcode shows the command as a process on the file server that exists until I CtrlC out of the original calling program.

Negative 21030 pIm currently experiencing this odd behaviour with WebSockets in JavaScript, which I cant figure out a reason for and which is driving me nuts. I hope that someone here can help me to find out what exactly is happening.p  pstrongThe scenario is as followsstrongp  pI have a Java application with a web server io.Undertow, which provides a connecting client in this case Chrome or Firefox with the required resources via HTTP. The client then opens a WebSocket connection native JavaScript Websocket API of the respective browser to the server, which initiates a new WebSocket session javax.websocket.Session for the communication. Then in case of some certain events the server notifies the connected client about these events with one message per event via the mentioned WebSocket connection. So far so good...p  pstrongThe problemstrongp  pWhen such an event occurs after the reestablishment of the WebSocket connection, the server correctly sends the message as expected, but the client both Chrome and Firefox seems to somehow buffer the incoming messages and does not fire the onMessage event of the WebSocket API until a total data amount of 8187 bytes has been received. Besides This is a strange number in my opinion am I missing some header bytes here When this point is reached suddenly all received messages are processed at once and the onMessage event is fired for all of them at the same time. After that the connection works fine and the onMessage event is fired for every single event.p  pAnother thing to mention This problem does not occur on the systems of two of my colleagues on their systems the events are fired correctly from the very beginning. So it has to be something specific to my system.p  pDoes anyone have any idea why this is happening on my system Is there any system, firewall, browser, other setting that could influence the browser in such a wayp  pstrongHeaders as provided by Chromestrongp  pRequest Headersp  precodeRequest URLws127.0.0.18080events Request MethodGET Status Code101 Switching Protocols AcceptEncodinggzip, deflate, sdch AcceptLanguagedeDE,deq0.8,enUSq0.6,enq0.4 CacheControlnocache ConnectionUpgrade CookieJSESSIONID...

Negative 21030 pive successfully managed to set up a reverse proxy which receives data via POST requests from clients and forwards them to a NodeJS server for further processing and storing.p  pnow i would like the nginx reverse proxy to return a 200 OK blank response for all of these requests BEFORE forwarding to the nodeJS server. so the clients will receive the response immediately without the need to wait for the backend server to finish the processing. if i use return 202 inside the location directive, the nginx reverse proxy does respond immediately, but never forwards the request to the NodeJS server.p  pcan this be achieved with nginx any help would be much appreciated.p  pThanks,p
Negative 21030 pAll,p  pThis might be a FAQ, but I cant get my searchfu to find it. Namely, I kind of want to do the reverse tar pipe.

But the remote system is one with negligible inode pressure, and it would be preferable to keep it as an expanded directory. p  pNow, I can think of various ways to do this with ampampcommand chaining and the like, but I figure there must be a way to do this with tarpipes and rsync or sshscp that I am just not seeing.p

Negative 21030 pI am writing a CGI script with Shell as basic language and with HTML and JavaScript in it. I am using Apache server and my OS is Ubuntu Server 14.01.1. p  pThere are multiple purposes of this script as well as its too big so I wont be sharing it here or explaining it fully. In a nutshell, I have a form in which I am validating fields, accepting values in Shell variables and then substituting them in a shell script which also runs in a CGI file when I click submit button. Now the issue here is there are fields whose data is sensitive as a result I MUST use the codePOSTcode form method. p  pMy CGI script works perfectly fine with codeGETcode method however with codePOSTcode, It just does not connect to next page. Right now, It is linked to a simple web page with no scripting or dynamic building. I instantly get the error codeConnection Reset By Peercode. When I checked apache error log, I get the error codeFailed to flush CGI output to clientcode. p  pI just cant find a way around this error. What can I do to make this workp

Negative 21030 pIm working on a simple app where a User can emfollowem other users. Users can emstarem posts. And a users feed is composed of posts that have been starred by users they follow. Pretty simple actually. However, this all gets complicated in Mongo and Meteor...p  pThere are basically two way of modeling this that I can think ofp  ol lipA user has a property, codefollowingcode, which is an array of userIds that the user follows. Also, a post has a property, codestarrerscode, which is an array of userIds that have starred this post. The good thing about this method is that publications are relatively simplep  precodeMeteor.publish feed, limit gt   Posts.findstarrers in Meteor.users.findOneuserId.following, sort date 1, limitlimit codepre  pWe arent reactively listening to who the user is following, but thats not too bad for now. The main problem with this approach is that 1 the individual documents will become large and inefficient if 1000000 people star a post. Another problem is that 2 it would be pain to keep track of information like when a user started following another user or when a user starred a post.pli lipThe other way of doing this is having two more collections, codeStarscode and codeFollowscode. If a user stars a post, then we create a document with properties codeuserIdcode and codepostIdcode. If a user follows another user, then we create a document with properties codeuserIdcode and codefollowIdcode. This gives us the advantage of smaller document sizes for codeUserscode and codePostscode, but complicated things when it comes to querying, especially because Mongo doesnt handle joinspli ol  pNow, I did some research and people seem to agree that the second choice is the right way to go. Now the problem Im having is efficiently querying and publishing. Based on the a hrefhttpsbook.discovermeteor.comchapteradvancedpublications relnofollowDiscover Meteor chapter about Advanced Publicationsa, I created a publication that publishes the posts that are starred by users followers  sorted, and limited.p  precode a helper to handle stopping observeChanges observer  sub, func gt   handle  null   sub.onStop gt      handle.stop    gt     handle.stop     handle  func   Meteor.publish feed, limit gt   sub  this   userId  userId    followIds  null   eventIds  null    publishFollows  observer sub,  gt     followIds       Follows.finduserIduserId.observeChanges        added id, doc gt         followIds[id]  doc.followId         sub.addedfollows, id, doc         publishStars          removed id gt         delete followIds[id]         sub.removedfollows, id         publishStars    publishStars  observer sub,  gt     eventIds       Stars.finduserId in .keysfollowIds.observeChanges        added id, doc gt         eventIds[id]  null         sub.addedstars, id, doc         publishEvents       removed id gt         delete eventIds[id]         sub.removedstars, id         publishEvents    publishEvents  observer sub,  gt     Events.findid in .keyseventIds, sort name1, date1, limitlimit.observeChanges        added id, doc gt         sub.addedevents, id, doc       changed id, fields gt         sub.changedevents, id, fields       removed id gt         sub.removedevents, id codepre  pWhile this works, it seems very limited at scale. Particularly, we have to compile a list of every starred post by every follower. The size of this list will grow very quickly. Then we do a huge codeincode query against all posts.p  pAnother annoyance is querying for the feed on the client after we subscribep  precodeMeteor.subscribefeed, 20 posts  null Tracker.autorun gt   followers  .pluckFollows.finduserId Meteor.userId.fetch, followId   starredPostIds  .pluckStars.finduserId in followers.fetch, postId   posts  Posts.findid in starredPostIds, sort date 1, limit 20.fetch codepre  pIts like were doing all this work twice.

Negative 21030 pI have codeActivity1code which is a list screen of items. Each item can be viewed in a separate codeActivity2code which is displayed as a popup. codeActivity1code can be launched from the background and displayed even when the screen is locked. codeActivity1code may also choose to automatically display the contents of an item in the list screen by starting codeActivity2code. We can bypass the lock screen because both activities have the codeWindowManagerFlags.DismissKeyguardcode enabled in the codeOnCreatecode method.p  pBefore Android Lollipop everything worked as expected. But now the popup codeActivity2code is not visible unless the device is manually unlocked. If I change codeActivity2code to be a full screen codeActivitycode then everything seems to work Except transitioning from one activity to another will briefly display the lock screen. Any ideas on how to fix this cleanlyp  pAlso, I have only tried the Galaxy S6S6 Edge devices which have this new Knox security feature on them.p  pstrongEditstrong I have changed codeActivity2code to be a codeDialogFragmentcode instead of an codeActivitycode. This worked for me best because the suggested answer used code that is deprecated or obsolete depending on the target sdk. codeActivity1code is using the following flags to bypass the lock screen when needed.p  precodegetWindow.addFlagsLayoutParams.FLAGDISMISSKEYGUARD getWindow.addFlagsLayoutParams.FLAGSHOWWHENLOCKED codepre  pSince codeActivity2code is now just a codeDialogFragmentcode, it uses the window flags of the parent codeActivity1code. I also remove those flags on the emandroid.intent.action.SCREENOFFem action so that the activity bypasses the lock screen only when launched as a notification and not every time the activity is at the top of the stack. Permissions mentioned in the answer are required.p

By clicking on one of the buttons youre redirected to another activity where I need to create a new button.p  pThe code responsible for MainScreen buttons looks like this and it worksp  precodepublic class MainScreen extends Activity implements View.OnClickListener   Button act2x2, act3x3, act4x4  Override protected void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState      super.onCreatesavedInstanceState     setContentViewR.layout.activitymainscreen      act2x2  Button findViewByIdR.id.Activity2x2     act3x3  Button findViewByIdR.id.Activity3x3     act4x4  Button findViewByIdR.id.Activity4x4      act2x2.setOnClickListenerthis     act3x3.setOnClickListenerthis     act4x4.setOnClickListenerthis   Override public void onClickView view      switchview.getId              case R.id.Activity2x2             Intent inent1  new Intentthis, macierz2x2.class             startActivityinent1             break          case R.id.Activity3x3             Intent inent2  new Intentthis, macierz3x3.class             startActivityinent2             break          case R.id.Activity4x4             Intent inent3  new Intentthis, macierz4x4.class             startActivityinent3             break      codepre  pAnd it is okay, I can normally enter the new activity, for example Activity2x2. Here, in 2x2 class Ive created a new OnClickListener and when I click on it, nothing happens. I am sitting here for two hours with debugger, it is saying that I dont have permissions, but It is impossible, because it is just a simple button.

Negative 21030 pI have an MVC 5 web site currently deployed onto AWS Elastic Beanstalk EB which lives at a nameofappenv.elasticbeanstalk.com. I want a subdomain of my current WordPress site www.mywebsite.com to point to this app, as the MVC 5 site is a portal where users can access a web application product. So subdomain.mywebsite.com would bring users to my elastic beanstalk application. Using GoDaddy I created a subdomain that uses Forwarding with Masking since I dont want the user to see the nameofappenv.elasticbeanstalk.com URL and when I visit subdomain.mywebsite.com it works, and I see the home page of my elasticbeanstalk app.p  pThe Problem is I cant navigate to any other pages in my EB App or even outside links, everything gets forwarded back to subdomain.mywebsite.com the home page of my EB web app. So for example, if I want to go to the login page of my EB app I would normally go to nameofappenv.elasticbeanstalk.comlogin using the subdomain it would subdomain.mywebsite.comlogin, however when I type that URL in it just gets redirected back to subdomain.mywebsite.com. IF I use just Forwarding without masking, then everything works fine but the elasticbeanstalk.com URL is used and I dont want the user to see that. I want all of the urls in my EB app to show up as relative to subdomain.mywebsite.com. So the login page should be at subdomain.mywebsite.comlogin. p  pI setup this subdomain and forwarding using the GoDaddy domain manager on their website. Thanks for the helpp

It works for a short while, however it occasionally crashed the application It appears to happen when user drags a tab before it and holds the mouse there, so its in a constant loop of trying to rearrange and something low level crashesp  pAny other suggestions on a feasible workaround either to this method, or a similar widget where this capability would be easier to implement I figure its probably possible to reclass the QTabWidget in a way that it would ignore mouse drags on the first tab, but Im not sure how I could go about preventing another tab from being moved before it... p

Negative 21030 pI have a java application that uses extensively the memory. It keeps a datastructure that grows very fast and is the responsible for the biggest amount of memory used. p  pIn order to avoid an Out Of Memory, I decide to flush the datastructure to a repository file or db and post process it. p  pThe problem that I face consists of choosing the timewhen the used memory is close to reach the maximum allowed to flush the datastructure into the repository. One way would be to keep track of the  datastructures memory usage on every update.p  precode         dataStructure.onUpdatenew CheckMemoryIfReachedMax                 public void onUpdatelong usedMemory                      if usedMemory  MaxMemory                          datastucture.flushInRepository                                                 codepre  pThe main problem in this case is that isnt easy to change the datastructure to keep track of the memory. p  pAnother possible solution would be to get the used memory from the JVM and compare it to the maximum memory. p  precode          Runtime runtime  Runtime.getRuntime           long freeMemory  runtime.freeMemory           if freeMemory lt MaxUsedMemory                datastucture.flushInRepository            codepre  pIn this case the problem is that the memory usage just gives a hint of how much memory is used, being that we cannot predict the moment the Garbage Collector removes the objects. This solution would make me flush more often the datastructure to the repository, so the application performance might suffer from this. p  pIs there any general pattern used in those cases Do you have any suggestion about which of the solution would be better suited to the problemp

Negative 21030 pI have a special requirement, and I believe there is no other way, that is Detect the unloading of DLLs. I googled it and found out a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4242469detectwhenamoduledllisunloadeda fouryears old SOa about this. I have chosen the same solution Hook codeFreeLibrarycode.p  pWhen code goes into codeMyFreeLibrarycode, I will hook the entry point of the specified module in the same way inlinehook. And in codeMyEntryPointcode, I will call the original entry point first, then check the codereasoncode argument  if the value equals to codeDLLPROCESSDETACHcode, it means that the cleanup work of this DLL is just done, and its going to be unloaded from the address space. At this point, I have the chance do my job. It works.p  pSo thats it  Unfortunately, its not finished. A very important thing is overlooked dependency.p  pFor example, codea.dllcode links against codeb.dllcode and codec.dllcode. When you load codea.dllcode, codeb.dllcode and codec.dllcode will be loaded be initialized first. This is because codeb.dllcode and codec.dllcode are listed in the import table of codea.dllcode, they are dependencies of codea.dllcode. Similarly, when you unload codea.dllcode, codeb.dllcode and codec.dllcode may be also unloaded if their reference count decreased to zero. I dont know the detail about how the loader finds out the dependencies of a DLL and unload them, The a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopms68315228vvs.8529.aspx relnofollowMSDNa page of codeFreeLibrarycode didnt talk about this, Im glad to understand this but I didt find the information.p  pSo the main problem is how to detect the unloading of dependencies of a DLL module. I want to have the same chance to do my job.p  pA possible solution may be the import table, find out the dependencies of a DLL from its import table, and find out the dependencies of dependencies from their import table and so on, find out all the dependencies, hook all the entry points, I dont know, It sounds crazy, I need some advice here.p

Negative 21030 pI was doing some research inspired by a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq32535686886887this questiona and I noticed that several of the proposed solutions to similar problems created a mutex object during initialization of a static variable.  Such a mutex will only work as desired if the thread that created it remains alive for the lifetime of the application.p  pNow it seems a reasonable guess that static variables are initialized by the process main thread, and it also seems a reasonable guess that the process main thread only exits when the main function exits which is presumably under the control of the programmer.p  pBut are either of these actually guaranteed by the C language standardp  pPS Im talking about Windows threads, not .NET threads.p

Negative 21030 pIm trying to figure out if this is a rendering bug in FF or if my CSS is not set up correctlyp  pThe effect should be a hidden button that fades in and slides in from the right, heres a a hrefhttpsjsfiddle.net25o4tjj8 relnofollowJSFiddlea example. Note that this is ionlyi to demonstrate the effect, this code works as expected in the major browsers and doesnt demonstrate the bug within JSFiddle only as a standalone page.p  pAs stated, the effect displays correctly and works as expected in all major browsers, but Firefox seems to run the codetransition visibility 0.5s, right 0.5s, opacity 0.5scode rule on the element on first page load more specifically the codeopacity 0.5scode rule which causes the element which is supposed to be hidden to flashfade .. that is to say that it is displayed in the coderight0code absolute position and then the transition to codeopacity0code triggers in Firefox only. Subsequent visits to the page do not cause this bug but forcing a refresh hitting F5 a couple of times or clearing the cache and revisiting the page will incite the issue.p  pInlining via the codeltstylegtcode tag in the HTML fixes the issue and overriding the style directly on the element just causes the transition to not work at all i.e. codeltdiv stylevisibilityhiddenopacity0gt ...code. p  pIm OK with leaving the codeltstylegt.cbutton gt inputlabel  form gt div  visibility hidden ltstylegtcode inline style in the HTML, but it does clutter it up and Id like to use this style elsewhere and inoti have to inline just for FF.p  pThe following code is the MVCE that causes the issuep  pbCSSbp  precodebody  fontsize 12px fontfamily Tahoma, Geneva, sansserif width 100 height 100 overflow hidden  .buttonrem  cursor pointer width 5em height 2em fontfamily Tahoma, Geneva, Consolas, Courier, sansserif background FF5050 color 490309 border 1px solid black textshadow 1px 1px 2px rgba125, 125, 125, 1 borderradius 0.25em  .buttonremhover  background FF7070  .container  width auto position absolute top 2.6em right 0.5em  .cbutton gt input  display none  hide checkbox .cbutton gt inputlabel  cursor pointer display block height 2em width 5em  .cbutton gt inputlabel gt font  position relative top 0.4em left 1.4em  .cbutton gt inputchecked  label gt font  display none   hide and replace text with Cancel  .cbutton gt inputchecked  labelafter  content Cancel position relative top 0.4em left 1em  .cbutton gt inputlabel  form gt div      visibility hidden     textalign right     width 17em     height 2em     position absolute     top 0     right 0     fontweight bold      color FF5050     zindex 1     opacity 0     transition visibility 0.5s, right 0.5s, opacity 0.5s     webkittransition visibility 0.5s, right 0.5s, opacity 0.5s  .cbutton gt inputchecked  label  form gt div      visibility visible     right 5.75em     zindex 1     opacity 1  .cbutton gt inputlabel  form gt div gt input  width 4.65em height 2em  codepre  pbHTMLbp  precodeltDOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC W3CDTD HTML 4.01 TransitionalENgt lthtmlgt     ltheadgt         lttitlegtCSS testlttitlegt         ltlink relstylesheet typetextcss hreftest.css gt     ltheadgt     ltbodygt         ltdiv classcontainergt             lt             adding this line fixes the issue .. why             ltstylegt.cbutton gt inputlabel  form gt div  visibility hidden ltstylegt             gt             ltdiv classcbuttongt                 ltinput typecheckbox nameclear idclear gt                 ltlabel forclear classbuttonrem titleClear file.xgtltfontgtClearltfontgtltlabelgt                 ltform methodPOST actiontest.phpgt                     ltinput typehidden namelogclear idlogclear valuefile.x gt                     ltdivgtClear file.x file ltinput typesubmit classbuttonrem valueOK titleClear file.x gtltdivgt                 ltformgt             ltdivgt         ltdivgt     ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pThanks in advancep

Negative 21030 pI have been working on an App that needs to use both GestureOverlayView and GestureDetector on one Layout, I need to use GestureDetector to detect simple gestures like swipe and fling, basically because if I use gestureOverlay it will take more time checking the gesture file for gesture like the one given, and I cannot use GestureDetector entirely because I have much more complet gestures that it cannot understand, most of which will be user defined, everytime I use the two together, Overlay seems to cover down GestureDetector, I was thinking since it is an Overlay, uts actually on top of GestureDectector hence GestureDetector isnt working, anyone know how I can have both to work on one layoutp
