Positive 16957 pI have a GUI in my database that hides the ribbon bars.  I have a Rich Text textbox.  I would like the user to be able to apply formatting to the text in the textbox.  If the user selects a range of text with the mouse the rich text formatting context menu will popup automatically.  However, if the user selects text with the cursor keys, or, wants to start a numbered or bulleted list, there is no sensible way to get the formatting context menu to appear.  Rightclicking does not bring up the formatting context menu.p  pIs there a way to bring up the formatting context menu some other way, e.g., with a button using VBA code or ... p

Positive 16957 pI am converting an excel spreadsheet over to an Access database.  I am new to Access, though I have taken a couple of courses through a local training company.  In the spreadsheet that I am converting, we currently use a tracking number that identifies each main record which would be in my new main table that is in the format of YYXXXX where YY is the current 2digit year and XXXX is a sequence number that begins at 0001 and could go up to 9999 each year.  So, the last record of 2014 might have been 141025, and the first record of 2015 is 150001.p  pFor consistency sake with my old data, I would like to use the same numbering system.  I know I can generate a standard autonumber as the primary key and I may do that as well anyway, but I want to have this YYXXXX field automatically sequence when I create a new record in a form.  So, how might you recommend an approach to do this  p  pMy first thought is to create and merge two strings, one that converts the current date to a two digit text field and the other an autonumber for the sequence  I have played around with this and havent been able to get anything to work.  I am not too good at VBA code, so it has all been just trying to create tables, fields and expressions.  But maybe VBA is the only way to do it.p  pWhile I dont know how to do this, one acceptable option might include using an autonumber that is six digits long and is just formatted with a dash after the first two digits, along with a way to easily restart the numbering, i.e. on Jan 1 of next year, set the autonumber to 160001 formatted as 160001. p  pAny great ideas out there p

Negative 16957 pHow do you create a hardlink as opposed to a symlink or a Mac OS alias in OS X that points to a directory I already know the command ln target destination but that only works when the target is a file.

Negative 16957 pI was helping out some colleagues of mine with an SQL problem. Mainly they wanted to move all the rows from table A to table B both tables having the same columns names and types. Although this was done in Oracle 11g I dont think it really matters.p  pTheir initial naive implementation was something like p  precodeBEGIN   INSERT INTO B SELECT  FROM A   DELETE FROM A   COMMIT END codepre  pTheir concern was if there were INSERTs made to table A during copying from A to B and the DELETE FROM A or TRUNCATE for what was worth would cause data loss having the newer inserted rows in A deleted.p  pOfcourse I quickly recommended storing the IDs of the copied rows in a temporary table and then deleting just the rows in A that matched the IDS in the temporary table.p  pHowever for curiositys sake we put up a little test by adding a wait command dont remember the PLSQL syntax between INSERT and DELETE. THen from a different connection we would insert rows emDURING THE WAITem.p  pWe observed that was a data loss by doing so. I reproduced the whole context in SQL Server and wrapped it all in a transaction but still the fresh new data was lost too in SQL Server. This made me think there is a systematic errorflaw in the initial approach.p  pHowever I cant tell if it was the fact that the TRANSACTION was not somehow isolated from the fresh new INSERTs or the fact that the INSERTs came during the WAIT command.p  pIn the end it was implemented using the temporary table suggested by me but we couldnt get the answer to Why the data loss.

Negative 16957 pAccording to the documentation, a prepared query provides a significant performance benefit if youre running a query multiple times because the overhead of the MySQL server parsing the query only happens once. Im wondering what exactly they mean by multiple times there.p  pI.e., say you have a web page that runs a query one time. Now say that page gets called 50 times per second. Does it make more sense from a performance standpoint to prepare the query thereby requiring two roundtrips to the DB server one to prepare the query, one to run it or to just send the query normally which only requires one roundtrip Is MySQL andor the PHP mysqli driver smart enough to realize when a query was prepared in a previous invocationp

I have no way to judge the quality of other answers here but hopefully others will find this thread helpful.p
Negative 16957 pWhat is the optimal easy to maintain, reasonably fast, robust implementation of treelike data structure with three levels I would like to use Dictionary or SortedDictionary, because all values nodes have unique keys.p  pThe first level is supposed to have about 300 items, every of these zero to tens hardly more than 100, usually less than 10 items on second level and about ten on third level. Levels two and three are closely connected so they should be probably represented by a single object. All the relations are 1n  p  precodeL1 L2 L3 ...1 to 10 L3 items for each L2 L3 L2 ...0 to 100, usually lt10 L2 items for each L1 L2 L1 L1 ...about 300 L1 items L1 codepre  pIs it better to create a dictionary in every 1st level object containing level2 objects a real tree or is it better to put all 2nd level objects into a single directory  p  pThe objects are not very big, they contain only some strings and numbers. The application is supposed to be standalone not needing any sql server or sop  pOr is object representation a wrong choice and I should go for something totally differentp
Negative 16957 pI have created a user control that will contain a table of LinkButtons and other information.  I create the table rows in another custom object and return a TableRowCollection with the link buttons in certain cells of these table rows.p  pIn the code behind for the user control I created an event handler for the button click of these LinkButtons.  I pass the user control into the method call to create the table rows using this and then attempt to add the event handler to the Click of the LinkButton.  For some reason, the event handler doesnt fire on a post back caused by this button.  Any ideas as to what I could do to make this event firep  pHere is the code where I create the button and add the event handlerp  precodeLinkButton button  new LinkButton button.Text  movie.Title button.Click  new EventHandlercontrol.LinkClick button.CommandArgument  result.LocalID.ToString cell1.Controls.Addbutton codepre  pWhere control is the user control passed in as a parameter and LinkClick is the event handler.p  pThanks in Advancep
Negative 16957 pgot a strange issue for you.p  pI created a control that inserts a record into a Database and writes a cookie to the users machine.

Here are the steps I have taken and duplicated several timesp  ol liCreate cookiedb entry by launching first page.li liVerify cookiedb entry exist they do at this step, checked via Chromes cookie managerli liLaunch second pageli ol  pOnce I load up the second page, which should spit out the ID that I set earlier, the cookie still exists but it is Unset.p  pHere is a screenshot of the cookie after I load the first pagep  pimg srchttpimgur.com66Z8O.png altalt text p  pAnd once I load the second pagep  pimg srchttpimgur.comDUeEx.png altalt text p  pSo from what I am seeing, the cookies valueexpiration get stripped out when I load the second page. Anyone have any ideas on why this is happeningp  pThanksp

Negative 16957 pIve got a Mac that I can run either the Leopard 10.5 or Snow Leopard 10.6 version of OS X on. Im using it to do web developmenttesting before publishing files to my production host. p  pOn the production host my sites doc root is under the home directory e.g. homestimulatingpixelspublichtml and Id like to duplicate that location on the Mac. Unfortunately, their is a hidden and lock placeholder on the Mac that looks like a mounted drive with nothing in it sitting in the home location. p  pI know from experience that its unwise to move this and drop in your own home directory because upgrades can cause it to be erased and it doesnt get stored in the TimeMachine backup, by the way. p  pSo, the question, is there anyway to safely use home on a Mac either Leopard or Snow Leopardp  pNote I realize this is very Mac specific and will be asking it in an Apple forum as well. Just wanted to ask here in addition to cover all the bases.p  pUpdate To help describe why I want to do this, in addition to the front end web site, Ive got a series of scripts that Id like to run as well. One of the main goals with being able to use the home directory and more specifically the same path from the servers root is so that can use the same output paths on the development mac as well be used on the production server. I know there are ways to work around this, but Id rather not have to deal with it. The real goal is to have all the files on the development Mac have the same filepath from the  root of the directory tree as the production server. p  pAnother Update The other reason that I forgot to mention earlier for this is setting up .htaccess paths when using basic authentication. Since those paths are from the file system root instead of the website docroot, they end up going through home when thats part of the tree. p

Negative 16957 pI am using a CustomPeerResolverService running in a windows service which hosts it in a ServiceHost with a number of peers on a peer to peer network. My server address is,p  pnet.tcp127.0.0.1Serverp  pThe idea being that the server and peers would work on a local machine when there was no network connection.p  pI have extended the CustomPeerResolverService class so I could see what was going on, and what actually happens when there is no LAN connection is that the peers call the Resolve method, which is asking Are there any other peers, and how can I find them, but they never call the register method.p  pThis means that the server is always saying no there are no other peers because none of the peers actually registered themselves.p  pOverall this results in connections between the peers and the resolution service, but never any connections between peers.p  pWhen I switch on my LAN connection the register method is called by each peer, and everything works properly.p  pI noticed something though, each peer had two TCP connections to the CustomPeerResolverService when the LAN was enabled, but only one when it was disabled.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 16957 pOkay, so we have this site that we took over from a previous firm...PHP, Zend Framework, MySQL etc.p  pIts an interesting site in that they utilize a CMS thats external they manage some data like forums, user subscription, etc.p  pSo theres a library that communicates via web service calls from PHP to the CMS, and then from JavaScript it calls the code which returns JSON data which is then manipulated into HTMLCSS.p  pWe need a scheduled task that runs daily. Its job is to get users from this CMS, iterate through them and check xxx amount of fields. Based upon the number of fields populated, if 80 or greater is populated, theyre eligible to be a featured user.p  pAnd, in our database, I have 2 fields isFeatured and featuredIndex. isFeatured being a flag, featuredIndex since a featured user will either be 1, 2, or 3.p  pEither way, our dev environment is Windows  PHP5  Apache with PHP running as an Apache module, and not CGI. p  pIm thinking the easiest approach is to write a PHP page that will be in the web root, which will only have permissions so it can be run as a scheduled task. What do you guys thinkp  pMy challenge is I need to test this locally suggestions. The staging and production environments are LAMP setups, fwiw. So, I guess my questions are the followingp  ol liIs this a good way of handling this issue I.e. a scheduled task which utilizes the existing framework which relies on this 3rd party CMS with web service communications and Zend Frameworkli liHow do I write this script so it can run both on Windows and Linux PHPli liAnd how do I schedule this script to run on a daily basis on Windows and Linux since its web based.li ol  pThanks all, Stevep

If a couple of users request the same resource, that could result in a couple of processes regenerating the exact same resource simultaneously, each taking up 1015 seconds. p  pWouldnt it be preferrable to have the frontend signal some background process saying Hey, regenerate this resource for me.p  pBut then what would it display to the user Rebuilding is not acceptable. All resources would have to be in cache ahead of time. This could be a problem as the database would almost be duplicated on the filesystem too big to fit in memory. Is there a way to avoid this Not ideal, but it seems like the only way out. p  pBut then theres one more problem. How to keep the same two processes from requesting the regeneration of a resource at the same time The background process could be regenerating the resource when a frontend asks for the regeneration of the same resource.p  pIm using PHP and the Zend Framework just in case someone wants to offer a platformspecific solution.

Negative 16957 pI have a cakePHP application that is pulling data from two different databases, which store dates and times in their data from different timezones. One databases timezone is codeEuropeBerlincode, and the others is codeAustraliaSydneycode. To make things more complicated, the application is hosted on a server in the US, and times must be presented to the end user in their local timezone.p  pIts easy enough to tell which database I have to access, and so I set the appropriate timezone using codedatedefaulttimezonesetcode in my codebeforeFindcode so that the query is sent with a date in the correct timezone.p  pMy problem is then converting the dates in the codeafterFindcode to the timezone of the user. Im passing this timezone through as a named parameter, and to access this in the model Im using codeConfigurewritecode and codeConfigure.readcode. This works fine.br The problem is that it seems to be applying my timezone conversion multiple times. For example, if Im querying the codeAustraliaSydneycode database from codeAustraliaPerthcode the time should be two hours behind, but its coming out as six hours behind. I tried echoing the times from my function before and after converting them, and each conversion was working correctly, but it was converting the times more than once, and I cant figure out why.p  pThe methods I am currently using in my codeAppModelcode to convert from one timezone to another is as followsp  precodefunction afterFindresults, primary      Only bother converting if the local timezone is set.     ifConfigurereadTIMEZONE         thisgtreplaceDateRecursiveresults     return results   function replaceDateRecursiveampresults     localtimezone  ConfigurereadTIMEZONE      foreachresults as key gt ampvalue         ifisarrayvalue             thisgtreplaceDateRecursivevalue                  else ifstrtotimevalue  false             fromtimezone  EuropeBerlin             if using the AustraliaSydney database                  fromtimezone  AustraliaSydney             value  thisgtconvertDatevalue, fromtimezone, localtimezone, Ymd His                 function convertDatevalue, fromtimezone, totimezone, format  Ymd His     datedefaulttimezonesetfromtimezone     value  dateYmd His e, strtotimevalue     datedefaulttimezonesettotimezone     value  dateformat, strtotimevalue      return value                      codepre  pSo does anyone have any ideas as to why the conversion is happening multiple times Or does anyone have a better method for converting the dates Im obviously doing something wrong, Im just stuck as to what that is.p

Negative 16957 pIm writing a small application in scala. The application processes simple log files.

Negative 16957 pHere is my problem. I have a variable in a package rec in this case that needs to be set when called from package 3, but its private. Previously the function settrue only set rec to true, so it wasnt a big deal. But I have another package that does the same processing Im giving a simple example, but my literal case is more complex, so I thought, well I could pass in the variable I want modified, and let it get changed.  Is the only way to set rec in the below layout, to create a second function in package one, that calls settrue with rec as the parameter I would like to avoid having to keep creating additional functions to handle the local variables. I cant move the variable to public spec as I am trying to follow convention and this type of variable isnt public anywhere else, and I dont want anyone to be able to just set it on their own I want functions to have to set. I dont want to have to create a second function named for example setlocaltrue, and creating an overloaded function settrue, with no parameters, that calls settruevalue  rec just seems deceptive, does anyone have any better suggestions with the limitations I havep  pMy two requirementsbr    1. Cant make the local variable public.br    2. Be able to use the function to calculate something both externally and internally.p  precodepackage one is  procedure settruevalue  out Boolean end one  package body one is    rec  Boolean begin  procedure settruevalue  out Boolean  begin   value  true  end settrue end one  package body two is  localrec  Boolean begin   procedure callfunction is    begin      one.settruevalue gt localrec   end callfunction end two  package body three is begin   procedure callfunction is   begin     one.settruevalue gt ltPACKAGE ONES REC   end callfunction end three codepre  pEDIT Or perhaps, what would be a better naming convention for the functions to specify that they are modifying the variable that is local to that package SetLocalTrue again is deceptive cause if you call it from package 3, youre not setting your local true, youre setting package ones local to true....p

Negative 16957 pI am currently developing an applet for some OpenGL ES stuff but I am absolutely unsure how I can handle the natives that comes with JOGL andor LWJGL.p  pLWJGL has a nice applet loader which can load jars containing the natives over the internet. The advantage of LWJGL is, that it has only on native pack for each platform and not one for 32bit and 64bit. Disadvantage is, that LWJGL doesnt support OpenGL ES, it just supports OpenGL correct me if I am wrong.p  pSo I plan to use the applet loader from LWJGL but implementing the OpenGL ES with JOGL. The big disadvantage is here, that I have no idea how I can change the natives for 32bit andor 64bit. The applet loader just takes one jar for the natives and the natives have the same name, so I cant create a bundle which has 32bit ans 64bit support.p  pTrying to run the 32bit natives on my 64bit Ubuntu doesnt work, it crashes with the error of a wrong header in the files... so wrong version, I guess.p  pI have no idea how I can solve this problem.p

Negative 16957 pIm having some problems debugging what appears to be a KVOrelated EXCBADACCESS exception on 10.6.6.p  pIve set up an observer on the position property of a CALayer subclass.

Currently if I call codeDirectory.Copy ramDirectory, fileSystemDirectory, false code, it simply adds the new files to the directory but leaves the old stale ones there.p  pI tried callingp  precodenew IndexWriter fsd, analyzer, true, IndexWriter.MaxFieldLength.UNLIMITED .Close codepre  p...to create a new empty index in the directory but this has strange behavior and sometimes results in the entire index being wiped clean on the next run of the program.p  pIs there any way I can simply get a list of the files a file system index is currently using so I can delete them manually I dont want to blindly erase all files in the directory in case there are some nonindex files there.p  pApparently codeFSDirectory.ListAllcode lists all files in the physical directory, whether or not they are actually part of the index. Is there any way I can tell if a particular file is usedcreated by the index I mean I cant even check file extensions due to Lucenes bizarre file naming conventions.p

Negative 16957 pHere is the scenariop  pI have successfully bound two objects from a native ObjC library with the codebtouchcode tool. The bound objects are a class and a protocol that acts as its Delegate object. The Delegate object contains both required and optional methods. I have included the extra enumerations that it needs to work. Everything compiles and works perfectly, except for the fact that if I do not override some of the optional methods in the managed Delegate class, I get a YouShouldNotCallbaseInThisMethod exception.p  pThis is how I have created the API definition for the protocol dummy method namesp  precode[BaseTypetypeofNSObject] [Model] interface TheDelegate      region Required     [Abstract]     [ExportrequiredMethod]     void RequiredMethodstring par     endregion Required      region Optional     [ExportoptMethod]     void OptMethodstring par     endregion Optional  codepre  pIf I leave the codeOptMethodcode out of the definition, the app executes perfectly. But in that case, the method will not be available to override when I will need it and I will have to create a new assembly with codebtouchcode to include it.p  pSo when I inherit the Delegate object like thisp  precodeprivate class MyDelegate  TheDelegate      public override void RequiredMethodstring par              inside RequiredMethod override       codepre  pI get the p  blockquote   p...baseInThisMethodp blockquote  pexception inside the OptMethod method. But if I inherit it with the same exact way, but the API definition does not contain the OptMethod, everything works fine.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 16957 pI am writing an application which reads an input file that currently has its own grammar, which is processed by lexyacc.p  pIm looking to modify this so as to make this input file a Python script instead, and was wondering if someone can point me to a beginners guide to using the parser module in Python.  Im fairly new to Python itself, but have worked through a fair chunk of the online tutorial. p  pFrom what I have researched, I know there are options such as pyparsing which can allow me to keep the existing grammar and use Pyparsing as a replacement for lexyacc. However, I am curious to learn the Python parser module in more detail and explore its feasibility.p  pThanks.p

Negative 16957 pI have built a CSS layout for a page that appears to work in tested browsers thus far and has previously validated CSS and HTML.p  pRandomly though, the layout breaks and codedivcodes move as if they lost their floats. The breaks occur in Firefox 4 and IE8 for sure so its not browser specific. There have been at times four codedivcodes that have moved but at other times only one 8212 so it doesnt break the same way every time. The breaks typically happen after a period of time away from the site and are fixed with either one or two refreshes. The breaks cannot be triggered with an empty cachecleared browser history. The breaks happen whether the header is on the actual page or as an include. The breaks happen probably one time out of 20 8212 but it really seems like its more about the time passed between page loads than about anything else. I am not understanding how this could purely be a cache issue since I cannot recreate the issue when I delete the cache.p  pOriginally, another forum answer said that it was the use of fontface but today I saw the layout break in IE8 and Firefox with the 2 fontface fonts loaded....so it is only the layout that broke while the fonts loaded.  So I am not sure if that is the issue.  The layout is built to work even if the fontface does not load.p  pHere is the link to the site that breaks  a hrefhttprg.isolatedfilmproductions.com relnofollowhttprg.isolatedfilmproductions.coma.

Negative 16957 pI have an application server side that sits on a port and listens for client connections. Once a connection is made, the app launches a parser another thread that deals with that connection.p  pMy problem is that at some points because the parsing can take long the server app launches a new thread while other is being processed. This is a desired behavior, not a problem per se. what happens is that the new thread seems to read some statevariable from the old thread and therefore acts wrongly.p  pLoosely, what the parser does is this the client always sends two packets the first is basically an knock knock packet and the second is the real data packet. I read the first, and if i decide to accept it i put that in a variable, so that the next packet can be read.p  pOn the scenario am describing, the first thread reads the knock knock packet and validates it. The next packet arrives on the same thread and the parsing starts.p  pIn the mean time, another parser is created and it waits for its first packet What then happens the problem is that it checks for the validation variable which should be false for this thread and it finds it to be ok it reads from the previous thread, which is still executing and proceeds to parse the knock knock packet as if it were the data packet.p  pWhat am lokoing for is a way to completely eliminate data sharing. am using the following class to keep track of the session statep  precodepublic class SessionInfo       private Constants.PacketValidity validity     private int packetSize     private String IMEI     private int packetReportedSize     private Constants.PacketType packetType     private int codec     private int records     private boolean valid     private Constants.ResponseType responseType     private String clientIP     private int serverPort     private Date parseInit     private Date parseEnd  codepre  papart from that, the class has a bunch of setters and getters.p  pthe parser has a instance of this object as a private field.p  pHow would i achieve thisp

The nature of my question is more around architecture.

Negative 16957 pI am working with templates which I am not very familiar with but something weird is happening.

However, when I create the very same instance inside a function then it throws compilation error not matching function pointing to the constructor of the templated class.p  pThe question is why does it work in the main method but not inside a function the very same piece of code there is no problem with inclusionp  pThe code is huge but I ll try to illustrate with an examplep  precodeint main  MyTemplatedClassParentltparametersgt examplearguments  MyTemplatedClassChildltparametersgt example1arguments  codepre  pWorks perfectly fine. Howeverp  precodeint main  myMethod  codepre  pwithp  precodemyMethod  MyTemplatedClassParentltparametersgt examplearguments MyTemplatedClassChildltparametersgt example1arguments  codepre  pdoes not. Basically in the second case it does not recognize the match between the call and the constructor of the class and it suggests as a candidate the constructor of the class I want to use. The point is that the very same thing works in the main method the only difference is that in the second case it is declared inside a method. p  pI hope I was clear enough.p  pThanks in advancep  pAltoberp  pedit Ok, somehow the problem was on the parameters of the templates that were the default ones originally. I know almost nothing on templates, but it appears that there were inconsistencies between the parameters of the two instances that were arising when the method was called. Do not know how and why, but as soon as I specified explicitly the parameters of the templates it compiled and worked fine. Again sorry for not giving much information but my knowledge on templates is very limited. p
Negative 16957 pI am building a SQL Server 2005 Integration Services package to migrate data from a Sybase Adaptive Server Enterprise 12.5.4 database to a SQL Server 2005 Database.  The Sybase Database is the backend for a vendor product which our team does not have the authority to change or manage.p  pIn my initial stages of development, to access the Sybase database, I created a SQL Server Linked Server utilizing the Microsoft OLE DB Provider for ODBC Drivers on my destination database server.  With this linked server created, I created my SSIS package with a single Data Source  connecting to the MS SQL Server Destination Database.  Next, in my SSIS package data flow tasks, I configured the OLE DB Source to access single Data Source defined in the package, using SQL commands to access the source linked server simply using SELECT col1, col2, col3 FROM [SybaseLinkedServer].[Database].dbo.[Table].   The OLE DB Destination within the data flow task utilizes the same connection manager as the OLE DB Source, but makes use of the Table or view  fast load Data access mode.  p  pLater, in the project, I obtained the Sybase ASE OLE DB Provider The v12.5.4 OLE DB Provider was no longer available, we had to purchase the v15.7 ASE SDK.  Thinking that removing the Linked Server from the solution would improve performance, I modified the SSIS package to include a new OLE DB Data Source utilizing the Sybase ASE OLE DB Provider to access the Sybase Database directly, and modified the OLE DB Source to use the new ASE OLE DB Data Source with the Table or View Data access mode. p  pTo my surprise, switching the solution from the Linked Server using the OLEDB Provider for ODBC Drivers to the direct OLEDB connection using the Sybase ASE OLEDB Provider produced significantly poorer results, far from my expectations.  a hrefhttpi55.tinypic.com71s2f7.jpg relnofollowThe results from test runs using each method are available at this hyperlink.ap  pHas anyone experienced this type of issue andor is this behavior to be expected  Is there a better way to configure this to extract data from Sybase ASE to MS SQL Server 2005p

Negative 16957 pI have a phpmysql application, part of which allows the user to upload a csv file.

The one downside is that the csv imports can contain between 2 and 10 columns  so Id have to make a database table of at least 11 columns with an ID field...which would be somewhat redundant in most cases.p  pOr should I just stick with the csv parsing Up to 500 rows is quite small...p  pOr perhaps there is another better alternativep

Negative 16957 pGiven a quaternion camera, how can I calculate its rotation when the player can walk on different surface normals walls.p  pIm working on a game which allows the player to walk on ceilings and walls in 3D space. Ive opted to use a quaternion camera system to avoid Gimbal Lock. Given a set of up0,1,0, right1,0,0, and forward0,0,1 vectors, I construct a quaternion. The player rotates around the up vector for heading and around the right vector for pitch.p  pWithout changing gravity vectors, the camera works fine and allows the player to move about the environment as if it were a standard FPS game.p  pFor simplicity, lets say the player can press a key which grabs the normal from the nearest collision surface that differs from their current normal, and assigns that as the new gravity vector.p  pUnfortunately, Ive run into a brainblock, and cannot figure out how to properly get the new up, right, and forward vectors from this new gravity vector and apply them to the current rotation quaternion, or even if that is the correct way to tackle the problem. If it helps, the movement and rotation code for my camera is below.p  precodeField forwardVectorTVector  TVector.Create0,0,1 Field rightVectorTVector  TVector.Create1,0,0 Field upVectorTVector  TVector.Create0,1,0  Field posTVector  New TVector Field headingQuaternionTQuaternion  TQuaternion.Create Field pitchQuaternionTQuaternion  TQuaternion.Create Field combinedRotationTQuaternion  TQuaternion.Create Field gravityVectorTVector  TVector.Create0,1,0   ChangeGravityVector  Method ChangeGravityVector newGravityVectorTVector       gravityVector  newGravityVector  End Method   MoveForward  Method MoveForward moveAmountFloat, noGravityByte  False       Local vecRotTVector      If noGravity  True           headingQuaternion.MultiplyByVector forwardVector          vecRot  combinedRotation.MultiplyByVector forwardVector       Else          vecRot  headingQuaternion.MultiplyByVector forwardVector       EndIf      vecRot.ScaleVector moveAmount      pos.AddVector vecRot   End Method   MoveUp  Method MoveUp moveAmountFloat, noGravityByte  False        Local vecRotTVector      If noGravity  True           headingQuaternion.MultiplyByVector gravityVector          vecRot  combinedRotation.MultiplyByVector gravityVector       Else          vecRot  headingQuaternion.MultiplyByVector gravityVector       EndIf      vecRot.ScaleVector moveAmount      pos.AddVector vecRot   End Method   MoveRight  Method MoveRight moveAmountFloat, noGravityByte  False        Local vecRotTVector      If noGravity  True           headingQuaternion.MultiplyByVector rightVector          vecRot  combinedRotation.MultiplyByVector rightVector       Else          vecRot  headingQuaternion.MultiplyByVector rightVector       EndIf      vecRot.ScaleVector moveAmount      pos.AddVector vecRot   End Method   RotateX  Method RotateX rotateAmountFloat       Local xRotQuatTQuaternion  TQuaternion.Create     xRotQuat.ConvertFromAxisAngle rightVector, rotateAmount      pitchQuaternion  pitchQuaternion.MultiplyByQuaternion xRotQuat   End Method   RotateY  Method RotateY rotateAmountFloat       Local yRotQuatTQuaternion  TQuaternion.Create     yRotQuat.ConvertFromAxisAngle gravityVector, rotateAmount      headingQuaternion  yRotQuat.MultiplyByQuaternion headingQuaternion   End Method   GetCameraMatrix  Method GetCameraMatrixTMatrix4x4      combinedRotation  headingQuaternion.MultiplyByQuaternion pitchQuaternion      Return combinedRotation.GetMatrix  End Method codepre

Negative 16957 pWe have two Apps live on the Appstore. One for free, and one full featured version which is offered to buy. The free app has a InAppStore so the user may update to the full featured version. p  pActually I am thinking about stoping development of the full featured App which is identical to the free one at code level. We dont want to blame our customers. It would be nice to give them a redemption code for the free app to unlock all features. All features which will be unlocked this way are bound to the redemption code. All customers who did InApp purchases are registered by Apple, so the purchase will be remembered for all devices. Finally all InApp customers would have an advantage over the ProVersion customers, which is not acceptable for us.p  pIs it possible to have one hidden free InApp purchase, which the user could buy if the redemption code is working Maybe a better question is What is the best practice for putting two similar Apps together without bugging the customersp

Negative 16957 pWhat would be some ways  the best way to add concurrency to the JavaScript programming game at jsrobots.com p  pIts essentially a JavaScript rewrite of an ancient DOS game called CROBOTS  BUT with a very important omission  there is no proper concurrency or virtual machining of the robot scripts. Each robot user script executes, completely, turn by turn.p  pI explain more about this limitation in the Robot scripting notes section of the how to play page  but basically it sucks and makes the game both unplayable and untrue to the original CROBOTS.p  pMy question is how should I go about putting concurrency of robot scripts into the game Its looking like one of NodeJS for a more serverside solution or browser Web Workers to keep it in the browser. Initially Im mostly playing with web workers. Should I make the emwholeem robot object a web worker Or just the user scripted bit The current robot object is responsible for drawing itself but web workers cant do this as no access to canvas object or DOM etc.p  pHow would you do itp  pThe basic game design is like a hrefhttptinypic.comview.phppic1zoxnbqamps5 relnofollowhttptinypic.comview.phppic1zoxnbqamps5a but this is basically a FOSS project so feel free to go crazy with View Source  [actually theres a slightly older version in GitHub a hrefhttpsgithub.comdanielrhodeswarpJSRobots relnofollowhttpsgithub.comdanielrhodeswarpJSRobotsa ]p  pThank youp

Negative 16957 pI have simplified this problem so its easier to post.  I am stuck on adding the configurations table which is not related in any way to the other tables.  If youd rather skip to see what my real problem is, please look at the final output that is current and the final output that is desired.  For convenience, I have a non working SQL solution at the end.p  pPlease help and thanks in advancep  pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pBasically Ive got a statement that has 8 inner joins to connect various table data.  I had originally had 8 different queries, but on my embedded machine, the queries run about 23 seconds long each making the total time around 2030 seconds total.  This is way too long.  Most of that time is transaction setup and teardown the queries were very fast.  Since Id like the data within a 12 second timeframe, I decided to combine all of the queries into a single query.  Unfortunately, the tables themselves are duplicates of an external database that isnt queriable from the embedded device I am not willing to combine the data at this point into a single table.  The device has only python2.5 and sqlite3, though I have installed sqlalchemy and Im using the ORM generally in my code.  Unfortunately, I am unable to produce more binaries on the machine, but I can write as much python as my heart desires.p  pstrongDatastrongp  ptable 1 usersp  precodename    number  data    alpha    12345  special  beta      54321  specialer codepre  pTable 2 unrelated to table 1  configurationp  precodename    data    lang   eng  big      24  medium  20  small  13 codepre  pFinal Table Output what Im currently gettingp  precodename    number  data           config    alpha    12345  special        null  beta      54321  specialer   null  null     null    null            langeng  null     null    null            big24  null     null    null            medium20  null     null    null            small13 codepre  pFinal Table Output what I wantp  precodename    number  data           config    alpha    12345  special        langeng, big24, medium20, small13  beta      54321  specialer   langeng, big24, medium20, small13 codepre  pstrongCurrent non working Solutionstrongp  pThis is what I have so farp  precodelt language sql gt SELECT  FROM  SELECT u.name as name                  ,u.number as number                 ,u.data as data                 ,NULL as config FROM users u UNION  SELECT NULL as name                  ,NULL as number                  ,NULL as data                  ,c.namec.data as config  FROM configurations c   t codepre

Negative 16957 pI have a software written on WPF using c and .NET 3.5 that need to connect to internet for exchanging data with some webservices. p  pFor testing purpose I used the a sim and the vodafone mobile internet stick key usb, and the vodafone mobile broadband software.p  pTo have some control on the internet connection  I simply launch the program vodafone mobile broadband inside c using the system.process classes. Once configured in automatic mode and not requesting the pin of the sim the software seems working correctly. p  pI am forced to close the application to kill the .exe software. Everything seems working for a while. But randomly after a while the vodafone mobile turns itself on manual connection so it does not connect to the internet anymore. p  pMobile broadband does not come with a seat of api and it is not possible to give AT command to open the connection. p  pSo my question is what device can I use that have C api to allow a pc to connect to internet to that is possible to open programmatically a connection to internet without user interaction so totally calleable and manageable by C.p  pThanks in advance for any suggestionp

Negative 16957 pIm looking to fit a plane to a set of  610k 3D points. Im looking to do this as fast as possible, and accuracy is not the highest concern frankly the plane can be off by 10 degrees in any of the cardinal axes.p  pMy current approach is to use best of best fit, but its incredibly slow Im hoping to extract planes at a rate of about 1050k times each time I run the algorithm, and at this rate it would finish in weeks, as opposed to hours as it works on all possible combinations of 6000 points, so 35,000,000,000 iterations, and frankly it has a much higher accuracy than I need.p  pDoes anybody know of any weaker planefitting techniques that might speed my algorithm up considerablyp  pEDITp  pIve managed to get the number of iterations down to 42k by creating planes at each possible 3D angle stepping through at 5 degrees each time and testing the existing points against these to find the best plane, instead of fitting planes to the points I have.p  pIm sure theres something to be gained here by divide and conquering too, although I worry I could jump straight past the best plane.p

We have an existing application which is dire, and a bunch of devices currently all 7 tablets, but this is not necessarily going to be always true running Froyo and Gingerbread for which the manufacturer has no plans to release ICS updates. On the one hand, it would suck to obsolete that hardware although we could go for nonsupported ICSbased 3rd party ROMs, but on the other hand it seems crazy to restrict myself to the 2.2 API when ICS emseemsem to offer a range of shiny new features.p  pIs there a good comparison reference out there, to see the key differences between API levels Also, given the glacial adoption rate of 4.0, am I insane to even consider dropping 2.x just yet And most importantly of all, what factors strongshouldstrong inform my decision as to which API to support, that I havent even mentioned abovep

Negative 16957 pI just finished watching a hrefhttpblog.lab49.comarchives2650 relnofollowJason Dolingers video on MVVMa, and Id like some clarification on how to properly setup and unit test the ICommand properties of my view models.p  pConsider the following ViewModel class with a FooBarCommand ICommandProperty.p  precodepublic class ViewModel  IViewModel      public ICommand FooBarCommand  get private set       public bool CanExectuteFooBar              return true           public void FooBar              Do some FooBarish stuff        public interface IViewModel      void FooBar     System.Windows.Input.ICommand FooBarCommand  get    public class FooBarCommand  ICommand      private ViewModel vm      public FooBarCommandViewModel vm              this.vm  vm          public bool CanExecuteobject parameter              return vm.CanExectuteFooBar           public event EventHandler CanExecuteChanged      public void Executeobject parameter              vm.FooBar       codepre  pSo if Im unit testing the FooBar functionality of ViewModel I could run FooBar either by calling testVM.FooBar or by executing the command by calling testVM.FooBarCommand.Execute. Which is preferred Im leaning towards testing the FooBarCommand property, because ultimately the buttons on the view are being bound to the FooBarCommand property not the FooBar method. p  pIn addition, since my View will be bound to an IViewModel not a ViewModel, I should be able to omit the FooBar method from the IViewModel interface entirely correctp

Negative 16957 pMy java program spends most time by reading some files and I want to optimize it, e.g., by using concurrency, prefetching, a hrefhttpwww.linuxtopia.orgonlinebooksprogrammingbooksthinkinginjavaTIJ314029.htmmemory mapped filesa, or whatever.p  pOptimizing without benchmarking is a nonsense, so I benchmark. However, during the benchmark the whole file content gets cached in RAM, unlike in the real run. Thus the runtimes of the benchmark are much smaller and most probably unrelated to the reality.p  pId need to somehow tell the OS Linux not to cache the file content, or better to wipe out the cache before each benchmark run. Or maybe consume most of the available RAM 32 GB, so that only a tiny fraction of the file content fits in. How to do itp  pIm using a hrefhttpcode.google.compcalipercalipera for benchmarking, but in this case I dont think its necessary its by no means a microbenchmark and Im not sure its a good idea.p

Negative 16957 pI recently changed from using vim on a linuxbased system to OS X, and am having trouble with some of the keybindings.

Negative 16957 pSo my scenario is basically this  If a user has an Arabic Locale, a date is formatted into this string   p  pThe numerals are Arabic and the date is orderedformatted a certain way according to the Arabic localeregion format.  The problem is that some users might have a Locale of Arabic, but the Language set to English because heshe might not be able to read Arabic.p  pIs there a way to change just the numerals to arabic, while preserving everything else in the formatter from the Locale  That is, format that date according to the localeregion format preserving order but to use English numerals rather than the Arabic numerals. I dont see any way that Apple has provided us with making such a change.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 16957 pI am currently trying to implement a single sign on solution across multiple JVM based Grails, Servlets web applications currently all deployed in the same servlet container currently Tomcat, but dont want to limit my solution to just Tomcat.  All web applications share a common database.p  pIve looked at various options from using CAS or other third party libraries to creating a new web service to handle Single Sign On, but none seem to really satisfy the business.  My current implementation involves creating a new jar library which has a common implementation of a hrefhttpstatic.springsource.orgspringsecuritysitedocs3.0.xapidocsorgspringframeworksecurityauthenticationAuthenticationProvider.htmlAuthenticationProvidersa, and a hrefhttpstatic.springsource.orgspringsecuritysitedocs3.0.xreferencepreauth.htmlPreAuthentication Filtersa based on Spring Security.p  pIn this approach I have multiple AuthenticationProviders currently Active Directory, and Database for the application to authenticate against.  Upon successful authentication a row would be inserted in a session table that contains the user, an expiration time, and a token.  The token would be also stored as a cookie on the users machine and that would be used to validate they have a current session in the PreAuthentication Filters.p  pHaving never done this before I want to make sure Im not creating a huge security problem, and Id also like to know what I would need to create the token  At this point a simple GUID seems to be sufficentp  pCurrently we are working on Spring Security 3.0.x, and havent upgraded to 3.1 yet.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 16957 pIn my project I have a model which holds basic information about model. For example lets say that the model is a Car. Then there are many different varieties of Cars and these have different data assigned to them. All models must be parcelables.p  pThe differences between different cars is very small, it might just be a few data fields. So this is solved by creating presenters just a class that holds data for the different cars. The presenter would then know which extra data it should hold.

Negative 16957 pHi guys Im a bit confused on how to use modules within my Zend Framework based application  from what Ive read up on modules work as sub application within your application however where does the line blur between what goes into a module and what can be handled within the controller. Like for example in a Home booking application you have the following featuresp  pHouse management Rate Management Booking online  booking managementp  pConsider that we have three types of users an admin user, a customer who makes the booking and a landlord who owns a house set up for booking how would be set up our modules i.e would we have something likep  precodeadmin gtcontrollers   gthouseController   gtrateController   gtbookingController   gtcustomersController landlord gtcontrollers   gthouseController   gtrateController   gtbookingController customer gtcontrollers   gtbookingController codepre  por would it be something likep  precodemodules gtBooking gtRate gtCustomers codepre  pThe latter format seems a bit like turning controllers into modules  whats the right approach herep  pIn the original listings  there are repeated controllers in each module. Pretty much the difference is quite minute eg houseController for instance in admin module  administrators can view all houses by all landlords while landlords can view only their own houses. Technically Im repeating 90 of the code here which doesnt seem like the right thing to do as I dont think you can use ACL to restrict the listings that can be viewed. What is the right approach here for this logicp

I am assuming that this function can not be passed null or not called at all in the process of recording video. Perhaps in other contexts this is okay. Unfortunately though, this does not seem to help me.p  pMy only next steps are to look into codeTextureViewcodes and to use a preview Texture as opposed to a typical SurfaceView implementation in order to use openGL to stretch the texture to my desired size that differs from the actual resolution and crop any excess off the screen, and then to Construct a Surface for the codesetPreviewDisplaycode function with the codeSurfaceSurfaceTexture surfaceTexturecode constructor for a Surface. I would like to avoid using a codeTextureViewcode due to incompatibility below ICS, and also because this adds significant complexity.p  pThis seems like a delicate process, but I am hoping someone can offer some advice in this area.p  pThank you.p

Negative 16957 pId love to use the emAndroidLargeHeaptrueem option in the Manifest to get a bit extra memory were dealing with 5 MB bitmaps on highres 1980x1200 displays and expect even larger displays shortly. p  pIve run out of all the normal tricks to dealing with the poor memory handling in Android for bitmaps i.e. there is no way to know if there is a hole large enough in fragmented memory other than to try and pray it doesnt crash. Ive already spent weeks optimizing, trimming and applying other tricks to minimize memory and prevent crashes. Its a trick of what features can be done in 2.x vs 3.x4.x, yet keep it all in a single app. No need to point to a how to optimize for bitmaps  Ive already gone through these and applied what I could.p  pLargeHeap is not supported on version 2.x, and I use different images for lower res screens that do not need the LargeHeap option in 2.x. no out of memory issue either.p  pWhen androidminSdkVersion8, it will not allow the AndroidLargeHeap option at all.p  pIs there any way to conditionally include LargeHeap for systems with 3.x, and have it ignored for 2.x Or have the application itself attempt to set LargeHeap if 3.x is detected  I cant find any way to do this, but perhaps Ive overlooked some trick.p  pI also realize LargeHeap is rather awful, but we are running out of other tricks. Ideally, it would be nice to do LargeHeap programatically, only when really needed and allowed at the program OnCreate.p

Negative 16957 pThe DatePickerDateBox Im using has a text field for the year. If I put my cursor in the box and start typing, it concatenates on the end ie, it starts out as 2013 and turns into 20132012. If I then pick a date and submit, the year gets changed automatically to be 1969. Presumably this is because the date is out of range. However, when I try to edit the year again to fix it, it automatically reverts to 1969 no matter what I type.

Negative 16957 pIm looking to effectively setup what would most easily be done as a multidimensional array in the Application scope [for instance declared in the Global.asa file or Applicationmultiarray] so that I can access it later. Single dimensional arrays work fine. Nested arrays, multidimensional arrays, collections in arrays, arrays in collections all seem to not work.p
Negative 16957 blockquote   pBlockquotep blockquote  pWe are using the ByCode method of mapping our data..p  pI have Process Process table object which has a List of ProcessStep ProcessStep table objects which in turn has a Bag of ProcessStepUser ProcessStepUser table objects assigned to each step.p  pThe objects load just fine, but in the web page if I delete a Step from the collection, rehydrate into MVC action as a Process and then save the process, the Step in the database simply has the ProcessId set to null which breaks the link, but leaves the Step in the Database and all its assigned users.p  pWhat I want to be able to do is delete a Step and have its ProcessStep and all its ProcessStepUsers deleted.p  pLikewise, when I edit a ProcessStep say I change the name of the step and save, its saving that, but the ProcessStep users are nulled out of their ProcessStepId and recreated, leaving orphaned records.p  pI do have a column on ProcessStepUser for overall ProcessId as well, so that I can prevent a User from being assigned more than once to any step of the process.p  pMy relevant mapping is as followsp  pProcessp  precode            Listx gt x.ProcessSteps, m gt                                                            m.Keyk gt k.ColumnProcessId                                m.Indexi gt i.ColumnStepOrder                                m.LazyCollectionLazy.NoLazy                                m.CascadeCascade.All                        m.Inversefalse                            ,              r gt r.OneToManyo gt o.Classtypeof ProcessStep codepre  pProcessStepp  precode            Bagx gt x.ProcessStepUsers, m gt                      m.Keyk gt k.ColumnProcessStepId             m.LazyCollectionLazy.NoLazy             m.CascadeCascade.All             m.Inversefalse         ,         r gt r.OneToManyo gt o.Classtypeof ProcessStepUser         ManyToOnex gt x.Process, m gt                      m.ColumnProcessId             m.Classtypeof Process                       codepre  pProcessStepUserp  precode            ManyToOnep gt p.Step, m gt                                                                    m.ColumnProcessStepId                                    m.Classtypeof ProcessStep                                         ManyToOnep gt p.Process, m gt                      m.ColumnProcessId             m.Classtypeof Process          codepre  pAs I said, it saves just fine on creation and loads just fine for display.

I would delete this question, but the site is not letting me to anything in Firefox but edit...p  pThe problem ended up being because I was getting the Process object from the database and then serializing it up to the View as a JSON object.  I then passed back the JSON object which was bound back to the Process object. p  pThe long and short is that our repository was calling SaveOrUpdateobj on the object, but since it had been disconnected, we needed to call Mergeobj which we did and worked perfectly.p  pI leave it to the powers that be as to whether this question has any value remaining.p  pThanksp

Negative 16957 pI have a web app with a jqgrid which is populated with data using jquery ajax, which calls a webmethod. The jqgrid is refreshed every 5 seconds to poll data. what i would like to do is get new data that is added to the table every 5 seconds. p  pSo i thought i would modify my webmethod to get data in batches of 20, starting from the last ID read. What i thought is in the webmethod i would do a counter, firstRecordID, lastRecordIDRead variables, if counter  0 i would get the first record ID and store it in firstRecordID, if counter is larger than 0 than firstRecordID would be the lastRecordIDRead firstRecordID  20. So if the first ID in database is 906, on the first poll it would get records from 906 to 925, then in second poll it will get from 926  20 other records and continue like this. p  pWhen this method is used in a console app as an example it worked fine, however i cant understand how should i go to implement this when using a webservice, since a webservice is stateless i dont know how i should implement the counter variable etc. Any idea please Or maybe a solution which is betterp  pThanks a lot.p

Negative 16957 pBefore i get to the point, let me introduce the context  Ive been working on the view layer of a MVC framwork im trying to develop. Ive created several reusable views such as an accordion, a drop down menu, a text editor, a color picker, etc. Using this, i can do, for example p  precodeltphp template  newViewTemplate templategtpanelgtaddnewViewAccordion     gtaddAccordion entry 1     gtaddAccordion entry 2     gtaddAccordion entry 3 templategtcontentgtaddnewViewBlock     gtaddBla bla bla     gtaddBla bla bla     gtaddBla bla bla echo template gt codepre  pAnd that sort of things. The problem is that, to be able to do that, i have to mix PHP and html code. For example  here is how i generate the HTML of a drop down menu p  precodepublic function toString      output          ltnav.thisgtgetHeader.gt.             thisgtlabel.             ltulgt     fori  0, l  countthisgtentries, last  l  1 i lt l i          ifi  0             thisgtentries[i]gtaddClassFirst                  elseifi  last             thisgtentries[i]gtaddClassLast                  output . ltligt.thisgtentries[i].ltligt          output .             ltulgt.         ltnavgt     return output  codepre  pA developper could easily design this by beautifying the code using Firebug or reading the PHP code, but a designer wouldnt like it. To solve this i would like to use the PHP templating system.

If i need to display a page containing 100 of them, how can i do  Should i require the view 100 times  Will it be executed  parsed  loaded from the damn slow disk 100 times  I dont see how i could build some kind of legostyle view layer using the templaetes.

Negative 16957 pI originally assumed the answer to my question was a simple yes, but some of the reading Ive done since has had me looking at the question again.p  pMy intention is to use modular code, which lets me pick and choose from a number of code sections to add various features to an app.  As an example, I might have a browser component that allows for safebrowsing, a survey component to take user surveys, and a core component that is the primary purpose of the app  be it displaying a menu or displaying a map of a location.p  pId want each independent module to have its own CoreData stack.  They dont talk to each other or interfere with each other in any way, outside of whatever is mediated by the app itself communication to the app done using the delegate model.  The browsers list of bookmarks and whitelisted sites is separate from the surveys list of survey data, which is also completely seperate from anything the core of the app does.  If they need to talk to each other, they can do so through delegate calls, which will consist of telling the app I need a browser to display X page, display the survey with this id, or finally Im done, return to the main app.p  pWhat started me down this path was realizing that there was no way to determine whether a given NSManagedObjectContextDidSaveNotification belongs to a given core data stack or not.  And, presumably, giving a MOC the notification from a different core data stack in the  mergeChangesFromContextDidSaveNotification method would be a bad idea.  Im also concerned what happens when you try to feed a MOCs own notification back into it, but thats something I can experiment with easily enoughp

Negative 16957 pI have downloaded the lite version of codeDayPilotcode from codehttpwww.daypilot.orgdaypilotlite.htmlcode  I have started working with it to try and get it going.  I have a website already built which I intend on linking this into.  The site is vb.net and I am using linq to sql.  Has anyone used this calendar before  I am not sure of how to use it.  I have created the control on my sidebar and can drag it into the page no problem.  The issue is that on the website there are tutorials which I have started working on.  However when I use the code from the tutorials the controls are not recognised. It is as though I need to add more files to my website for controls to work.  I am not very experienced with aftermarket controls, or coding for that matter.  For example I have copied the following codep  precodeProtected Sub DayPilotCalendar1EventMoveByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As DayPilot.Web.Ui.Events.EventMoveEventArgs Handles DayPilotCalendar1.EventMove     dbUpdateEvente.Value, e.NewStart, e.NewEnd     DayPilotCalendar1.DataSource  dbGetEventsDayPilotCalendar1.StartDate, DayPilotCalendar1.Days     DayPilotCalendar1.DataBind     DayPilotCalendar1.Update End Sub codepre  pThe lines codeDayPilot.Web.Ui.Events.EventMoveEventArgscode and codeDayPilotCalendar1.Updatecode come up with the error Type DayPilot.Web.Ui.Events.EventMoveEventArgs is not defined and Update is not a member of DayPilot.Web.UI.DayPilotCalendar.   Any tips or advice.  Btw I dont feel skilled enough to create my own timetable, unless somebody knows of a fairly comprehensive guide of how to do it.p

Negative 16957 pI was asked to build a tree from an array where each element contained  the data for the node and the level of the node within the tree. The array was a preorder traversal of the node.p  pI think my solution was wrong or at least not the best way of doing it but Im not sure why and what the right solution would be.p  pMy approach was to start with level 0 on the first call to the function and then loop through the array and when I found anything with a level that is exactly 1 greater than the level in the current recursive call, I make a recursive call that takes the array starting at the index of that element and increment level. Then, the result of that recursive call would be the child.p  pI also check if the level of the element in the array is equal to the level in the current recursive call if so, I break out of the loop because it would be my sibling and I dont want to return my sibling because my parent will take care of that in another recursive call.p  pDoes that make any sense What would I need to change to answer this question correctlyp

This describes our Questions, each one is an Objectli lidtos[0].students Arrayli lidtos[0].students[0][n].answers Array. Each student arrayObject has an Answers array.

Important things here are it has an array called this.studentsPages. This array will ultimately have as many entries as there were students in dtos[0].students.p  pSo we loop through this for loop disecting the dtos array and creating a pagesSet array. strongHere comes my problem.strong On the first iteration through the for loop I create this questionObject element. I also have tried just doing var questionObject  , but what you see now was just an attempt to fix the problem I was seeing, but it didnt work either.p  pSo at the end of the first iteration of the outer for loop I call stage.addPageSet, this is what happens herep  precodevar pageObject  []             pageObject[questions]  pageSet             pageObject[displayName]  studentInfo.displayName             this.studentsPages[this.studentsPages.length]  pageObject              ifthis.studentsPages.length  1  first time only                 forvar i  0 i lt pageSet.length i                      this.addPagepageSet[i]                               codepre  pThe important thing to take notice of here is where I add pageObject on to this.studentsPages which was an empty array before the first call. pageObject now has pageSet plus a little bit more information. Remember, pageSet was an Object and thus passed by reference.p  pOn the next iteration of the for loop, when I hit this linep  precodequestionObject.answer  dtos[0].result.students[i].answers[j].studentAnswer codepre  pIt goes wrong. This changes the local copy of questionObject, BUT it also changes the copy of questionObjec that was passed to addPageSet and added to the studentsPages array in the first iteration. So, if I only had 2 students coming in, then when all is said and done, studentsPages hold 2 identical Objects. This should not be true.p  pThe problem is questionObject in the doGradeAssignmentContent function is keeping a reference to the Object created on the previous iteration and then overrides it on all subsequent iterations.p  pWhat can I do to fix thisp  pThanks for the helpp

I can vaguely argue that I dont like the invisible magic in the getter and the dependency on a global variable in a data class.

Negative 16957 pI know there have been tons of questions regarding this, and I went through most of them in the past 2 hours looking for a working answer, none made it. p  pMy dilemma is that I am making a geocoder. My program is just a gui that allows users to chose an excel file containing addresses to be read, and then by pressing another button to have a new excel file created containing said data and the latitude and longitude linked to it. Now my client will most likely run it with thousands of rows at a time which is why I would like to add a progress bar instead of having the program just hanging. But, the issue with that right now is that as expected, the bar isnt updated until the end. p  pNow I read about swingworker but I cant seem to get how to implement it. Should my actionperformed method do nothing but create a new thread where all the work is done  If so how would I get the status of the work as it goes  I am really confused right now on that issue and would appreciate any help.p  pThank you.p

Negative 16957 pI recently upgraded the CXF libraries from 2.2.11 to 2.7.5. And this is throwing IllegalAnnotationsException error. I have listed below the error along with more details about the application.p  pI used wsdl2java along with xjc for generating the binding classes from the xsd files. So after this, we have multiple object factory classes in different packages. Some of the object factory classes have same method name, but they are in different packages though. So it compiles fine as per the spec from JAXB.p  pBut during the run time, i get this below error.p  precodeorg.apache.cxf.service.factory.ServiceConstructionException     Caused by com.sun.xml.internal.bind.v2.runtime.IllegalAnnotationsException 34 counts        of IllegalAnnotationExceptions     The element name urncom.company.myproject.v4DateEntered has more than one mapping. this problem is related to the following location     at public javax.xml.bind.JAXBElement com.company.myproject.specificmodule.v2.ObjectFactory.createDateEnteredjavax.xml.datatype.XMLGregorianCalendar this problem is related to the following location     at public javax.xml.bind.JAXBElement com.company.myproject.commontypes.v2.ObjectFactory.createDateEnteredjavax.xml.datatype.XMLGregorianCalendar codepre  pThis worked absolutely fine with CXF 2.2.11. Not sure why this is failing in the latest CXF. I tried generating the wsdl2java with CXF 2.7.5, but no luck. Tried several options by customising the JAXB bindings to have a different methodname, but that also did not work. p  pCan you please suggest me what is going wrong here I strongly feel that there is some CXF setting which could do the trick as the same object factory classes worked fine with older version of CXF.p

Negative 16957 pIm in a situation where I have a codeBagcode that has a codeAddSlotcode method inside. I have two types of bags, codeItemsBagcode and codeDCBagcode stands for draggable content codeItemsBagcode is a 2D bag meaning it has rows and columns, codeDCBagcode is 1D, it has only one column but many rows Which means I can consider it 2D as well.p  pNow the thing is, since the first bag deals with 2D indices, I would want codeAddSlotcode signature to be something like thisp  precodepublic void AddSlotint r, int c codepre  pAnd the other bags codeAddSlotcodep  precodepublic void AddSlotint r codepre  pHow can I write a virtualabstract signature of codeAddSlotcode in codeBagcode such that when codeItemsBagcode and codeDCBagcode inherit from codeBagcode they can override the signature in the way I mentioned abovep  pAs I said, I can consider the codeDCBagcode to be 2D as well, so that both it and codeItemsBagcode have the same signature, but I really want to know if I could do this, its very interesting.p  pI could get away using a variable number of arguments codeparams obejct[] argscode but it would be nice to do it in a way that doesnt involve boxingunboxing.p  pI could also make a codeTwoDimBagcode and codeOneDimBagcode make them both inherit from codeBagcode, write the definitions of codeAddSlotcode in them the way I want to, and then make codeItemsBagcode inherit codeTwoDimBagcode and codeDCBagcode inherit codeOneDimBagcode, but Im not looking for workarounds more than how to achieve what Im asking for.p  pAgain to recap one last time how can I write a signature that I could override in the inheriting children that is, if I can and there is a wayp  pThanks.p  pEDIT Extra Info The codeBagcode has a lot of functionality in it. The difference between the two bags is that codeItemsBagcode holds a 2d List of Slot codeListltListltSlotgtgtcode, while codeDCBagcode has a 1d codeListcode of codeSlotcode. Its the codeSlotcode that holds an codeItemcode.  Items in codeItemsBagcode could take more than one codeSlotcode, items in codeDCBagcode take only one.p  pSome of the things you can do in both bags codeAddSlotcode, codeFreeSlotcode, codeAddItemcode adding strategy differs, there are also extra adding methods in codeItemsBagcode, in both the bags you could pickup an item with your mouse, swap items, sort items, both bags also receive notifications from slots to take necessary actions like codeNotifyClickedOnEmptySlotSlot slotcodep  pSome of things you can only do in codeItemsBagcode Combine items, adding a row of slots, adding a col of slots and rotate items.p  pHeres how the bags differ in terms of appearance, codeItemsBagcode a hrefhttpwww.youtube.comwatchvJRxdtzI6Hs relnofollowheresa an old demop  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comK7FZ1.jpg altenter image description herep  pcodeDCBagcodep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.como8V4o.png altenter image description herep

Is that so hard No magic. No Active Directory. Just authentication by me.p  pMy current, working, approach is to set custom headers which are interpreted at the SignalR level using a custom AuthorizeAttribute, however apparently the right way to do it is not to do authentication at the authorisation level and instead have the webserver do that before any SignalR stuff happens.p  pCan anyone please describe a good procedure for full, but dirtsimple, custom authenticationp

Negative 16957 pI have a very strange problem with my responsive css. The body is 90 wide.p  pIf the horizontal resolution goes below 1200px, I change it to 100 with media queries, but in resolution below 1000px it should be 100 again.p  pMy page has two centered containers, the other on the left side is below behind with zindex the right one and it has a background image. Both containers have fluid width.p  pSo basically when the screen width goes below a certain point, the left container with the image goes little be under the right one. The right container has a margin from 20px to leave some space. This 20px margin should be transparent.p  pThis is working fine, but if I scale the browser between 1000px and 1200px, the margin from the right content container becomes opaque, but it should not. It should be transparent, as it is in wider width.p  pI do not know where this behaviour comes from, since I do not change anything at the margins.p  pJust scale your browser to a width between 1000px and 1200px then you see the green gap between the image and content. and if you scale litte more tahn 1200px, you see that the margin is transparent againp  pSorry bit difficult to explainp

Negative 16957 pI am creating a rails app that has a User and Post model that implements the a hrefhttpsgithub.comryantoactsasvotableActAsVotable gema.p  pI want users to be able to upvote and downvote posts, but also want to rank and sort posts by a weightedscore algorithm that takes into account the number of upvotes, downvotes, and time the post was created.p  pMy weightedscore algorithm is taken from Reddit and better described a hrefhttpamix.dkblogpost19588herea.p  pMy Post Modelp  precodeclass Post lt ActiveRecordBase   belongsto user   actsasvotable     Raw scores are  upvotes  downvotes   def rawscore     return self.upvotes.size  self.downvotes.size   end    def weightedscore     rawscore  self.rawscore     order  Math.log[rawscore.abs, 1].max, 10     if rawscore gt 0         sign  1     elsif rawscore lt 0         sign  1     else         sign  0     end     seconds  self.createdat.toi  1134028003     return order  sign  seconds  450007.ceil  7.0   end end codepre  pI want to use the ActsAsVoteable gem because it supports caching which may decrease the number of hard disk writes and save time. Currently the weightscore of a post can be calculated on the fly but is not saved in the database, meaning I cannot do database sorts on posts with the highest weightedscore.p  pIf I created a column in the post model I would have to update the posts table every time a user voted on a post, which defeats the purpose of using the ActsAsTagable gem  as I dont take advantage of its caching ability.p  pSo I want to add a column to the votes table to store the weightedscore which will then be calculated every time the post is voted on, as well as a method to the Votes model to calculate this score, however the gem does not provide a model when I run its generator. It only creates a votes table which I do not know how to access without a model.p  pAny help on how I can add such a weightedscore column and method to the votes model, or on how to achieve efficiently storing the weighted score of a post in a different manner is appreciated.p

That clearly seemed like a magic quotes issues.  And in fact, I solved the easily enough by disabled magic quotes on server1, and recycling Apache.p  pBut Im mystified as to how it broke in the first place.  I put in an alert right before the POST in the JavaScript, and the JSON did not appear to be escaped.  But once it gets to server2, and is written to disk, it is escaped.  Server 2 has PHP 5.4.9, so it doesnt even have the magic quotes feature, and in fact it was turning off magic quotes on server1 that solved the problem.  So clearly, server1 was causing the problem.p  pWhat I cant figure out is, how did PHP magic quotes get applied between the alert in my JavaScript code, and the POST to server2  The JavaScript code isnt calling back to PHP on server1 in that path ... my best guess is that the characters were already escaped when the page was built, and before javascript retrieved the data from the page, and that the JavaScript alert hid that from me somehow ... is that possiblep  pTheres probably a really obvious answer, but Im relatively new to this stuff.  Im hoping someone can point out what Im overlooking.p

Negative 16957 pI am developping an application using App Engine to collect, store and deliver data to users.

But during the following hours, the used memory increases and goes over the limit of F1 Instance. However, the scheduler doesnt start another instance. When I stop all traffic, average memory never decreases. Now I have 150MB memory instead of 128MB limit of F1 class and I stopped all the traffic. I Tried to set performance settings manually or automatic, disable Appstats without any improvement.p  pI use Memcache and datastore, dont have any cron or task queues and the traffic is always the same.

This particular function, codesnakeprintcode, looks like thisp  precodesnakeprintint x, int y, int ch     mvprintwy,x,c,ch     wrefreshscreen  codepre  pwhere codeputcharcode puts the character codechcode on the screen and coderefreshscrcode refreshes it.

It moves down to where it is supposed to return from the functions with correct stack content, and then something happens when GDB makrks codecode in codesnakeprintcode as being the code running, the value code0x804d190code is put on the stack, along with a call to codesnakeprint0x804d190,15,111code. The next line of code executed is, again, coderefreshscrscrcode and then I get a segmentation fault.p  pI examined code0x804d190code with GDB and saw that it contained the value code0x10000fcode. Since, in the new call to codesnakeprintcode, my previous xvalue of 15 is exchanged for 0x804d190, it would seem that something has happened to the memory address where the xvalue was stored, since 15  0xf and were just one off, so to speak.p  pI have no idea whatsoever why this happens, so I was wondering if anyone could help figure out what is wrongp

Negative 16957 pI searched around this site to try to find a similar answer, but I had no luck.p  pWhat Im trying to do is set up an image, ad, or button and tag in it with event listeners, so that I can track events.  Ive managed to do this, but what I really need is something that will let me gather the interaction data of each individual, provide a unique id for each individual, and gather realtime event interaction information, so that I can record and possibly act on different events based on user interaction.  p  pI was looking into google analytics for this because I can see the realtime events, but I dont know if it is possible to call these events in the way I explained.  Ideally there would be an api call I could make with a populated unique id to pull in the event interaction information in real time.  p  pAny help or direction would be greatly appreciated.p  pThanksp

Negative 16957 pIn Hadoop v2 I need to create a codeRecordReadercode andor an codeInputFormatcode based on some large binary formats stored in HDFS.

But even if I do have to precompute the split points, I dont know how to write a custom splitter so Id appreciate a pointer to something like that too if possible.p  pOne point to note the payload of each record is essentially arbitrary binary data, and may contain the codeFOOOcode 4byte constant in it as far as I know.  So if an input split falls somewhere in the middle of a record, I cant necessarily just advance to the next instance of codeFOOOcode to find the next record, nor would that be an efficient way to manage recordfinding since it means scanning all the data rather than just the headers and seeking to the necessary locations.p

Negative 16957 pIm not sure how to call that, if anyone can think of better title, let me know, Ill rename this question.p  pThis is not reallife example, but if I get solution to such situation, Ill use it in bigger project. Just assume that I emHAVE TOem do it like described below, I cant change the idea, I need to find solution that will fit it. At the moment Im not allowed to show any more details of original project.p  pstrongIdeastrongp  pSo, lets assume Im creating cronlike thingie, basing on YAPSY plugins. Id like to store plugins in some directory, once in a while my daemon would collect all plugins from that directory, call their methods and go to sleep for some more time. Those plugins should be able to access some singleton, which will store some data, for example URLs used by plugins, etc. I also have TCP server running in the same process, that will modify this singleton, so I can customize behaviour on runtime. TCP server should have readwrite access to singleton, and plugins should have readonly access. There may be many singletons I mean, many classes behaving as singleton, not many instances of one class, duh readable to plugins and modifiable by TCP server. Plugin methods are called with some values generated just before we call them, and they can be generated only in the process in which they live.p  pstrongQuestionstrongp  pHow do I grant readonly access to plugins I want total isolation, so that if codesingletoncode has field codexcode, which is object, then fields of codesingleton.xcode like codesingleton.x.ycode should also be readonly for plugins. Readonly means that plugins should be able to modify those fields, but it wont have any effect on rest of runtime, so when plugins method returns, singleton and its fields, and their fields, etc should be the same as before running plugins method, so its not really readonly. Also, plugins may be ran in concurrent fashion, and release GIL for some time they may have IO operations, or just use time.sleep. p  pemEDITemp  pSolution has to be multiplatform, and work at least on Linux, Windows and MacOS.p  pemEDITemp  pstrongApproachesstrongp  ol lipI could try inspecting stack in singletons methods to see if any caller is plugin, and if so, storing original value of any modified field. Then, after plugin method call, I would use function restore which would restore singleton to state before running plugin.pli lipI could try running plugins method in another process, with multiprocessing, passing all singletons easily done, by using metaclass for keeping track of all of them, and rebuilding them in new process, or explicitly storing singletons somewhere to subprocess. pli lipI could try wrapping codeglobalscode and codelocalscode into some codedictcodes, that would do similiar  trick as in point 1 with restoring original values or would deep copy all globals and locals, and run it with codeexeccode, with code of plugins method not with string, I know thats unsafe.pli ol  pstrongWhy wont approaches above workstrongp  p1 Stack inspection is usually wrong, and Id say in this situation it is very wrong. Also, restoring variables after each call could be very expensive, when there would be many modifications done by plugin. Also, plugin methods may run in concurrent fashion, so I would need to restore original values every time GIL is released, and restore pluginwide values any time GIL is acquired  that would hurt a lot can you even imagine implementing this At this moment, I cant, and Im not really sorry about that.p  p2 YAPSY plugins are not picklable, so I cannot send them to subprocess.p  p3 codeexeccode wont take code with free variables for execution, it cant see scope in which it is called, so I would need to find all free variables of plugins function Id use wrapper, generated on runtime, like thisp  precodedef noargplugincall     plugin.methodsomething, from, locals codepre  pand pass codenoargsplugincall.codecode  and store them in wrapped codelocalscode. Also, deep copy of the whole environment would be as expensive as in 1.p  pstrongPS.strong By fields I mean attributes, because Ive unfortunately grown up on Java and alike. p  pstrongPPS.strong If youve heard about any plugin system that will be similiar to YAPSY it has to have all the features and be as lightweight and will generate picklable instances, that would an enough for me p
Negative 16957 pI am attempting to insert a file utilizing either bulk insert or bcp. The file is a fixed width file that has rows with far fewer columns positions than the format file specifies.  When executing either statement, these rows are excluded, but the process does not error out.p  pThe file contains 42 records. Three records are incomplete Field lengths are only several hundred positions out of a possible 6000 positions. I am expecting all 42 records to be attempted, and ultimately, expect the process to error out due to the 3 incomplete records. Any help or insight would be greatly appreciated.

Negative 16957 pIn objectivec I am often updating the frames of my views during animations. I currently have a messy solution to doing sop  precodeCGPoint newOrigin  CGPointMake25.0, 25.0     view.frame  CGRectMakenewOrigin.x, newOrigin.y, view.frame.size.width, view.frame.size.height codepre  pWhat Im looking for is a simple convenience method that works like thisp  precodeview.frame  CGRectWithNewOriginview.frame, newOrigin codepre  pIs there an existing method in the SDK which does this or will I need to define my ownp  pstrongSolved 0x7fffffff has the correct answer but JackWus suggestion is a better approachstrongp  pThe solution offered by Jack Wu solved my problem. The iOS SDK has no method which does this so you will need to define your own inline method to do so. However, utilizing the UIViews center property is a better approach. No need to define an inline function and it also will continue to work if the view has had a transform applied to it.p

Negative 16957 pI am working on a problem in which I have chess boardstates represented as 2d arrays. I need the ability to see if the current boardstate I am working with has been seen before.p  pI thought of using a HashMap object that takes a 2d array as an argument and then creates its unique hash value. Then I can see if the HashMap object contains whichever board state I am currently working with by using HashMaps .contains method.p  pWhat I am confused about is that the HashMap object takes key and value arguments.  I just need an object that simply takes in a 2d array as an argument and creates its unique hash value, and then allows me to use .contains and .put methods.p  pIm getting the feeling that I dont really understand hashMaps properly, so where am I getting confusedp

Negative 16957 pAs a common security habit, I learned that you shouldnt allow root login through ssh on machines open to the world. The way to go is to ssh to your server with a user account, then use sudo. Also Ubuntu disabled sshing as root account by default.p  pWhen Im configuring a server manually I usually execute codesudo icode to have a persistent root shell, so that I dont have to type codesudocode in front of every command.p  pNow Im not completely sure whats the best way to do it with Ansible. In Ansibles inventory files, you can specify the user to use for sshing with the codeansiblesshusercode variable. In Ansible playbooks and tasks you have these optionsp  ul liremoteuser  The user to ssh to the machine with for the specific playbooktaskli lisudo  If codeyescode, runs the commands in the playbooktask with sudoli lisudouser  Sudo to a different user and then execute the commands in the playbooktaskli ul  pSo I specified the user I use for sshing with codeansiblesshusercode and then I have a couple of tasks that need root privileges.p  pI have a two of options to do this, but I dont really like themp  ol lipI could use codesudo yescode for every single task that needs root privileges.p  pI dont really like this way because I will have to use this for almost every task.pli lipI could put codesudo yescode in the playbook that includes the rolestasks.p  pI doubt if this should be the correct way, because like this, all rolestasks should assume that they always have root privileges. Also, if we would do it like this, why cant I then just set this as an option in the Ansible config, so that all my playbooks and its rolestasks will always use sudopli ol  pSo I wonder, what is the correct way to do thisp

Negative 16957 pWith my question I suspect a lot of people may get confused between dynamic styling what you can achieve by jQuerys .css function and dynamic CSS rules. The first is where it only changes the styles of existing elements matching the selector.

Negative 16957 pI have an app which makes rest calls and represents the data in a GridView.p  pThe main activity uses two fragements, a UI Fragment and a retained worker fragment.  The worker fragment contains an inner AsyncTask that performs the REST calls.p  pEverything was working great I had no crashes etc, until I tried to do an update on a regular interval.p  pIn order to perform the interval I added a handler.  The handler is a member of the worker fragment.  Within the worker fragment I have the LoadAPI method which calls the asynctask.p  precodepublic void loadAPI     final String myURL  httpx.com     handler.postnew Runnable          public void run             new APITask.executemyURL             handler.postDelayedthis,10000                codepre  pThe problem is when there is a config change, my activity is destroyed, and onPostExecute crashes when it references the main activities listener.  But I have implemented onAttach in my worker fragment.  onCancel seems an ugly option, as multiple asynctasks can get called, and I dont have a named instance.  I suppose I could keep a list of asynctasks in the worker fragment and cancel them onDestroy Its ok to lose the latest update but I think I am doing something wrong here.  What is frustrating is the worker frag and asynctask were working fine until I did a continuous polling and I cant figure out why the introduction of the handler is causing this behavior.  p  pMy api tasks will take anywhere from 50 milisecond to 5 seconds.p
Negative 16957 pI know that its almost impossible to prevent files from being downloaded. But I know that theres something that can stop them from being streamed on other websites. direct download, as far as I know is hard to prevent.

Negative 16957 pOccasionally Ive found that codestringcode implements codeIClonablecode interface and I wondered why, since string is immutable. Further I tried to guess how it should work and what to expect from cloning a string... I expected it should return same string reference when string interning is enabled, and create new object in case it is disabled I undertand that in that case equality operator wouldnt have worked correctly anymore  probably thats why it isnt implemented this way.p  pWhen I decompiled the method from .NET sources  I found that the implementation is just returning selfreference codethiscode pointer without any extra logic. And there is a comment on itp  precode Method required for the ICloneable interface.  Theres no point in cloning a string since theyre immutable, so we simply return this. codepre  pSo .NET team themselves say there is no point calling this method. But why did they implement it at all thenp

Negative 16957 pLets say Ive create a annotation called codeEnableFeauturecode which imports a bean configuration class codeEnableFeatureConfigurationcode. This annotation is typically placed on top of the dispatcher configuration. Must beans like view resolvers etc. belong to that dispatcher config but a few beans really belong to the root context. p  pHow can I define those beans without the need for another annotation My first thought was to autowire the codeWebApplicationContextcode and call codecontext.getParentBeanFactorycode to register beans but Im not sure if this is the best way to achieve my goal. How is this typically donep  hr  h3UPDATEh3  pTo clarify the problem a bit. Im working on a project to integrate a template engine with Spring MVC. The project consists of the following categories  partsp  ul liConfigurationli liAnnotation e.g. codeEnableFeaturecode imports configurationli liViewli liViewResolverli liTemplate factoryli ul  pLogically all class categories could exist in the web application context. However, the template factory could be used by other services as well email, etc.. Services that mostly exist in the root context. So what Im basically asking is, how can I make the factory available to the root context in a clean way. I would like the configuration required to be as low as possible. As of now the setup only requires one annotation placed on top of the dispatcher configuration class.p

Negative 16957 pI am trying to create a function that creates an object and counts the number duplicates per number in an array. For example if I have an array that is code[1,2,2,2,3,3]code my function should return 3 because there are two duplicates of code2code and one duplicate of code3code. So I wrote a function that I thought was clever. I decided to create a mapping of frequences of each element. By setting the creation of each new property i.e. unique number in the array equal to 1. For some reason when I do this I get property values that are all equal to zero.

Negative 16957 pI have an issue with using commas for decimal separator in Html.TextBox plain form inputs in ASP.NET MVC and telerik mvc grid.p  pI know that this is largely due to JSON specs which defines that numbers must use dot . for decimal separator. So, my server responses always contain numbers with dots.p  pIve decided to take matters in my own hands. I made simple js functions that allow only proper characters in inputs based on hidden separator somewhere in page. And that is working.p  pBut what I cannot control is the way input reads data from json initial value in input.  That happens when telerik mvc grid enters edit mode. At that point inputs are rendered and all of them show values always with dots json spec.p  pI am not sure who does the reading from json i presume telerik mvc grid, but i would like to know where to hook up, so i could read json, and insert values in inputs myself.p  pAnyone can point me in right directionp

Negative 16957 pI have got a rare problem at the moment, hope I can get any help from here. Thanks in advance.p  pThe thing is that my company has two apps, outsouced one named A and insourced one B both in the App Store and running normally. Of cource they are not identical but similar indeed. There is a decision from the management that we are going to replace A with B, so that there is only one app in the app store instead of two.p  pHere is what I am thinking to archive this, 1.

Negative 16957 pI am building an application which does some work when a specific wifi network is connected. To check if my wifi network is connected i am running a background service which runs a thread of infinite loop inside it. The thread checks for wifi connection is active or not. If yes, then it displays the notification and keeps the notification until wifi is disconnected. I cannot find the better approach to check for my connection asynchronously. The problems I am facing is as follows If service is already running and I connect to network i get a notification. Now I open my application and notification still shows. Then I disconnect from wifi connection and the notification disappears, I connect again and notification appears again  as well ,as it should. Now if I remove my app from the overview and then disconnect from the wifi, my notification does not go, it sticks in the notification panel. Although this error is uncertain and occur in some phones and not in some.  p  pI am posting my service code and main activity code. Please suggest me a better approach to do this task.p  pMyService.javap  pdiv classsnippet datalangjs datahidefalse div classsnippetcode pre classsnippetcodehtml langhtml

Negative 16957 pI was wondering how can I change voice packets size in webrtc application I am using opus and I am trying to change packet size from 20 ms to 40 ms. I thought I can achieve it through changing ptime in sdp. However when I captured packets with wireshark there is not difference between packets with ptime20 and ptime40 and the difference between consecutive time stamps is always 960. I would expect the difference to be  1920 for 40ms ptime. I imagine I am completely wrong in my assumptions, is there any way to actually change packet sizesp

Could it be that the export of an xcarchive with an adHoc certificate does not handle the entitelments the same way as with an enterprise or development provisioning And if so, how should i configure the project that the archivedexpandedentitlements.xcent gets created with an adHoc provisioning p  pThanks for any Helpp
Negative 16957 pI have two vertical divs, one to the left and one to the right. The left div contains text that ends after lets say half a page. I want to let my right div behave like this fill the content on the right of the left div as long as the left div continues downwards. But when the left div ends the right div should fill the whole page. This is because the right div is much longer than the left div and I want to avoid that the right div continues narrowly after the left div ends and the user has to scroll down too much.

Negative 16957 pWe have a few VMs in Azure and we rely on the a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.combpowershellarchive20140807introducingtheazurepowershelldscdesiredstateconfigurationextension.aspx relnofollowPowerShell DSC extensiona to deploy our code to the machines. I want to make sure that this extension is not updated automatically so that our code that uses functionality from this extension dont break without we knowing about it first.p  pThe problem is that we have some deployment scripts that read the extensions status codesmessages and do custom logic based on them. When the extension was updated from 1.4.0.0 which is the version that the plugin was on when we first started using it to the version 1.5.0.0, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma267596911946412some of the status messages changed and our script stopped workinga. This completely broke our deployment process and we had to do an emergency update on our scripts to be compatible with v1.5. Now that version 1.7.0.0 was released the same exact problem happened again. Some new status codes were added and I had to update our scripts or we would not have a working deployment pipeline.p  pIs it possible to specify a manual update process for these extensions Their installation and update seem to be completely automated. Ideally, Id like to be able to update them on a case by case basis after testing our scripts against the newer versions first, so that our deployment process is not halted because of that. Bonus points for anyone who manages to find up to date documentation or some kind of release notes document for this extension in particular, as I could find none... I was just surprised to see that version 1.7 was installed today when I got an error from our script, and was lucky to know exactly where to look for the status changes.p

Negative 16957 pBased on my understanding, each socket is associated with two buffers, a send buffer and a receive buffer, so when I call the codesendcode function, what happens is that the data to send will be placed into the send buffer, and it is the responsibility of Windows now to send the content of this send buffer to the other end.p  pIn a blocking socket, the codesendcode function does not return until the entire data supplied to it has been placed into the send buffer.p  pSo what is the size of the send bufferp  pI performed the following test sending 1 GB worth of datap  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt  include ltWinSock2.hgt pragma commentlib, ws232.lib  include ltWindows.hgt  int main       Initialize Winsock     WSADATA wsa     WSAStartupMAKEWORD2, 2, ampwsa       Create socket     SOCKET s  socketAFINET, SOCKSTREAM, 0             Connect to 192.168.1.712345     sockaddrin address     address.sinfamily  AFINET     address.sinaddr.saddr  inetaddr192.168.1.7     address.sinport  htons12345     connects, sockaddrampaddress, sizeofaddress             Create 1 GB buffer AAAAAA...A     char buffer  new char[1073741824]     memsetbuffer, 0x41, 1073741824       Send buffer     int i  sends, buffer, 1073741824, 0      printfsend has returnednReturn value dnWSAGetLastError dn, i, WSAGetLastError            getchar     return 0  codepre  pOutputp  precodesend has returned Return value 1073741824 WSAGetLastError 0 codepre  pcodesendcode has returned immediately, does this means that the send buffer has a size of at least 1 GBp  pThis is some information about the testp  ul liI am using a TCP blocking socket.li liI have connected to a LAN machine.li liClient Windows version Windows 7 Ultimate 64bit.li liServer Windows version Windows XP SP2 32bit installed on Virtual Box.li ul  hr  pstrongEditstrong I have also attempted to connect to Google 173.194.116.1880 and I got the same results.p  pstrongEdit 2strong I have discovered something strange, setting the send buffer to a value between 64 KB and 130 KB will make codesendcode work as expectedp  precodeint sendbuffer  64  1024     64 KB int sendbuffersizeof  sizeofint setsockopts, SOLSOCKET, SOSNDBUF, charsendbuffer, sendbuffersizeof codepre  pstrongEdit 3strong It turned out thanks to Harry Johnston that I have used codesetsockoptcode in an incorrect way, this is how it is usedp  precodesetsockopts, SOLSOCKET, SOSNDBUF, charampsendbuffer, sendbuffersizeof codepre  pSetting the send buffer to a value between 64 KB and 130 KB strongdoes notstrong make codesendcode work as expected, strongbut ratherstrong setting the send buffer to code0code makes it block this is what I noticed anyway, I dont have any documentation for this behavior.p  pstrongSo my question now is where can I find a documentation on how codesendcode and maybe other socket operations work under Windowsstrongp

Negative 16957 pIf an EJB is injected by CDI container using codeInjectcode, because that CDI has scope, that means this EJB will have scope and its lifecycle will be controlled by CDI container instead of EJB containerp  pOr the CDI container only injects and the lifecycle is controlled by EJB containerp  pFor example I implement a SLSB which has its lifecycle controled by EJB container.

Negative 16957 pIm facing two problems with fragments in Android.p  pI have an app with a Navigation Drawer Fragment inside my MainActivity. When I click in an item on this Navigation Drawer, a new fragment is load on the fragmentplaceholder inside the Main Activity. Pretty simple.p  pWhen the MainActivity is created, Im loading homeFragment inside fragmentplaceholder. This fragment has a SlidingTabLayout with two tabs, each one loading its corresponding fragment. This Home Fragment is my main part of the app.p  pWhen I click on another item in Navigation Drawer, the Home Fragment is replaced with the another Fragment, for example, when I click on My account, the My account fragment is loaded on fragmentplaceholder. I have 3 itens in the Navigation Drawer.p  pI want to keep the Home Fragment and the two tabsfragments inside it on back stack, so I can navigate on any fragment my account, config, and so on and when I press back button, Im getting back to Home Fragment.p  pI tried to addToBackStack the Home Fragment inside onCreate of MainActivity before I commit it, but is not working properly. If I press the My account item on navigation drawer, and then press back, the app load My account fragment again, and if I press back again, app is closed. Another case if I press the Home item, and then press back, the app back to the same home fragment but without any tab its not loading the two fragments belonging to him.p  pHere is my appp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comQPlV1.png altMainActivityp  pHere is my code MainActivityp  precodepublic class MainActivity extends ActionBarActivity   private Toolbar mToolbar  Override protected void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState      super.onCreatesavedInstanceState     setContentViewR.layout.activitymain     setupDrawer       Loading home fragment     if findViewByIdR.id.fragmentplaceholder  null           if savedInstanceState  null              return                  FragmentTransaction fragmentTransaction  getSupportFragmentManager.beginTransaction         HomeFragment homeFragment  new HomeFragment         homeFragment.setArgumentsgetIntent.getExtras          fragmentTransaction.replaceR.id.fragmentplaceholder, homeFragment         fragmentTransaction.addToBackStacknull  This is not working properly         fragmentTransaction.commit       codepre  pNavigation Drawer itemClicked methodp  precode Override public void itemClickedView view, int position       FragmentTransaction fragmentTransaction  fragmentManager.beginTransaction      switchposition               Home         case 0             HomeFragment homeFragment  new HomeFragment             fragmentTransaction.replaceR.id.fragmentplaceholder, homeFragment             break           My account         case 1             MyAccountFragment myAccountFragment  new MyAccountFragment             fragmentTransaction.replaceR.id.fragmentplaceholder, myAccountFragment             break           Config         case 2             ConfigFragment configFragment  new ConfigFragment             fragmentTransaction.replaceR.id.fragmentplaceholder, configFragment              break            fragmentTransaction.commit     mDrawerLayout.closeDrawermDrawerListView    codepre  pThank you and sorry about my english.p

Negative 16957 pI am currently writing test cases for a ContentProvider in my application which is a checkbook recording app and I am having a test fail when it is comparing double values. The best way to illustrate this is with code. I have this function that returns ContentValues for an account object to be inserted into the databasep  precodeprivate ContentValues getAccountContentValues    String testName  Capital One    double testStartingBalance  3000.00     ContentValues accountValues  new ContentValues    accountValues.putAccountEntry.COLUMNNAME, testName    accountValues.putAccountEntry.COLUMNBALANCE, testStartingBalance     return accountValues  codepre  pInside a function codetestInsertReadProvidercode I have the following code, to insert that accountp  precode Get Account values and write them ContentValues accountValues  getAccountContentValues Uri accountInsertUri           mContext.getContentResolver.insertAccountEntry.CONTENTURI, accountValues long accountRowId  ContentUris.parseIdaccountInsertUri   Verify we got a row back assertTrueaccountRowId gt 0   A cursor is the primary interface to the query results Cursor cursor  mContext.getContentResolver.query         AccountEntry.CONTENTURI,  Table name         null,  columns to be returned. Null returns all columns         null,  Columns for where clause         null,  Values for where clause         null  Sort order    Validate the information read from the database. validateCursorcursor, accountValues cursor.close codepre  pThe validate cursor function takes a cursor and a ContentValues and loops through them using a map to compare each value. This is a strategy I learned from following a Udacity tutorial on creating Android applications, so maybe there is a better way to compare them instead of as strings, but it looks like thisp  precodevoid validateCursorCursor valueCursor, ContentValues expectedValues    assertTruevalueCursor.moveToFirst     SetltMap.EntryltString, Objectgtgt valueSet  expectedValues.valueSet     forMap.EntryltString, Objectgt entry  valueSet        String columnName  entry.getKey        int idx  valueCursor.getColumnIndexcolumnName        assertFalseidx  1        String expectedValue  entry.getValue.toString        assertEqualsexpectedValue, valueCursor.getStringidx        valueCursor.close  codepre  pThe test is failing when the codeassertEqualscode line is called, and I get the following error messagep  blockquote   pjunit.framework.ComparisonFailure expectedlt3000[.0] but   waslt3000[]p blockquote  pIt looks like the cursor.getString method is truncating the decimal places if they are equal to 0. If I try this test using a value of 3000.01 it works fine. Is SQLite responsible for dropping the unnecessary zeroes Can I change the codeassertEqualscode in some way so that those two values are treated the samep

Negative 16957 pI have divs inside a a larger parent div.  All these child divs have a 50 width. The idea is to have 2 columns.  Also these child divs have a dynamic height.p  pI have an example here.  a hrefhttpsjsfiddle.nety2jpr052 relnofollowhttpsjsfiddle.nety2jpr052ap  pThis is done with inlineblock. And as you can see, there is bizarre spacing between the divs. What is that exactly And how can I get rid of it.

Negative 16957 pI was using a CQL Filter to return my points based on a certain type. I then added a BBOX to the filter to limit the results only to the current extent of the map. This was all working correctly. The only issue is if I pan the map it does not reload the WFS call. So if I zoom into a point the wfs filters correctly, if I then pan to an area where I know there is a point there will be nothing there unless I change the zoom level. This will update the WFS.p  pIn my ServerVector loader parameter I call a function updateWFSURLextent. I use this to build the WFS url based on the filter criteria to be passed to the CQLFILTER. I currently have no loading strategy, I tried using createTile and bbox but neither gave me the proper result.p  pHere is the code I am using to add the BBOX to my CQLFILTER. More filters are added after and this filter is appended to the WFS url.p  precodevar coord1  ol.proj.transform[extent[0], extent[1]], EPSG3857, EPSG4326 var coord2  ol.proj.transform[extent[2], extent[3]], EPSG3857, EPSG4326 var filter  ampCQLFILTERBBOXGEOM,   coord1  ,   coord2  , EPSG4326 codepre  pThe workaround I found was to capture the map moveend event and call the updateWFSURLextent from there. This will update properly on a pan but causes the updateWFSURL to be called twice on zoom since it gets fired from the WFS loader and moveend event.p  pThe solution I am looking for is to either have my WFS update properly on the pan or how to determine the difference between a panzoom so I can not call the function in moveend if it was a zoom.p  pAdded more code below. Removed the geoserver url and layer name I am using and stripped out some of CQL Filter that was just filtering on an ID.

Negative 16957 pFirst the important information.  I have a development machine that is running Ubuntu 14.04 desktop, MySQL server 5.6 and ruby 2.1.3 with rails 4.2.0.beta2.  I developed an application with two simple tables in MySQL called users and listings.  My app works beautifully on this machine.  I am now migrating it to the production machine.  Only major difference in configuration is that it is running the server edition of Ubuntu and not desktop.  Same version though.  After configuring that machine I checked out my app from source control to production.  When setting up the database I was able to perform rake dbcreate and rake dbschemaload without issue.  I have verified this through running sql queries directly to mysql.  My problem is that I can not insert any data through my rails application.br Note I still need to configure Phusion and Apache completely so I am running from command line and console right now.

It generates a ready made setup for an single page application and includes requireJS optimization configuration support in the included gulp file using Steves own gulprequirejsbundler.p  pThe bundler plugin creates .js files for each bundle you set in the optimizer config in the output folder.p  pThe issue Im having is that requireJS will ALWAYS try to load these bundle JS files from the emcurrentem path instead of the emrootem site path. Remember that Im using an SPA, so folders are not real.p  peg if you access  www.mysite.comeventdashboard p  pthen it will try to load eventdashboard.js the bundled module from www.mysite.comeventeventdashboard.js p  pObviously that location doesnt exist being a SPA so it fails. p  pI need a way to control where requireJS loads these bundles from but I dont know where this can be configured. p  pHaving looked under the hood of Steves gulprequirejsbundler plugin, Im thinking the problem may lie in the way requireJS loads the bundles.p  pHeres the issue raised on the gulp plugin a hrefhttpsgithub.comSteveSandersongulprequirejsbundlerissues4 relnofollowhttpsgithub.comSteveSandersongulprequirejsbundlerissues4ap  pIt doesnt seem that theres alot of activity going on around this so not sure if ill get a reply anytime soon there.p  pIm wondering if anyone has experienced this or has any advice.p  pNote the only modification I have made is swapped out hasher for History.js so that urls dont use a hashbang to control the client side page routing.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 16957 pMy JSF has two forms.  codeForm1code is the main form and it is loaded with existing DB values when the page is loaded.  Occasionally, as defined by the business logic, an update submission of Form1 will trigger a codePrimeFacescode codepdialogcode, which contains codeForm2code that collects extra data to complement Form1.  If the user provides data that passes validation, the submit codehcommandButtoncode in Form2 will invoke a backing bean method that will save the data from both forms.  However, if the user cancels the submit button or just closes the the pdialog, I would like to roll back the state of the view to the last loaded values from the DB.p  pI have no preference whether to do it by using the PrimeFaces codeRequestContextcode from the backing bean in a method that is called by the cancel button or by doing it all in the JSF using either JSF EL or codefajaxcode.  How can this be done p  pE.g. RequestContext has a method coderesetCollectionltStringgt expressionscode but I would like to not be specifying each form field to be reset, instead do all of them.p

Negative 16957 pI understand that ENABLEBITCODE will build the executable with LLVM bitcode so that the App Store can compile it to arm64 or armv7 before delivering to devices.  Naturally many developers will depend on open and third party licensed source code which dont directly use codexcodebuildcode but may want to take advantage of this feature.p  pLibraries like libjpegturbo are built using the standard configure  make, which uses clang directly.  I assume that the xcodebuild ENABLEBITCODE option must end up instructing clang to only build LLVM during the Archive for App Store process.p  pSo in a nutshell, what is the effect of using this flag on the underlying build and can I emulate it  My assumption is that the app bundle sent to apple shall ONLY be composed of LLVM bitcode e.g. no target architecture binary is shipped with the bundle.p  pIve watched the WWDC videos on app thinning.  I cant believe information like this wouldnt be included.p  pEDIT Another problem is the fact that many third party dependencies have a lot of hardcoded assembly.  Does the ENABLEBITCODE flag have any impact of converting the platform specific assembly to LLVM bitcodep

Negative 16957 pI dont want to create a validator, rather I want to listen for any validation errors so that I can do something special. p  pSo for example lets say I have a codeDateFieldcode and the user enters invalid date, I want to have a codelistenercode that will be notified at the same time as the field is highlighted in red by Vaadin. I looked everywhere I could and could not find any kind of Validation codeListenercode or error notification mechanism. I can create my own custom validators, but thats not what I want to do. I want to be notified of validation errors from fields like codeDateFieldcode which already have their own builtin validators. There must be some way because some kind of listener has to be notified to change the css values for the field as well as add the question mark in the caption...p
Negative 16957 pI am currently working on a project which has a number of background tasks that get executed. Each task created and then sent to a concurrent service which manages the execution process of all tasks. Each task is stored in a database table during the length of its execution.p  pMy dilemma is that each task performs very specific functions, and in general most delegate to a service in another part of the system, the brunt of the work is done, and then the task returns.p  pCurrently I have a very simple system implemented which tracks the progress of task, it works well, however each task that is executed needs to add a lot of extra code to accommodate the functionality on the services it delegates to.p  pSo to as an example my task would have a methodp  precodeOverride public void execute      service.calculateAverage  codepre  pAnd then correspondingly in the servicep  precodepublic float calculateAverage      float total  0.0f      for i  0 i lt 20 i          total  i          return total  20  codepre  pTracking the progress of this is fairly simple, I just update my task in the database after it has gone past a certain threshold of iterations. However, to generify this is proving to be quite a task, as each task that is executed might delegate to a different service entirely. This means in each service I need to add code specific to the implementation for that service.p  pI have done a bit of searching and I cant seem to find any good patterns that can help with creating a generic system for tracking the progress of each task. Any pointers or even just places to look or readup on would be good.p

Negative 16957 pWell, I really messed up yesterday... I tried to install Ubuntu alongside my Windows 8.1 installation.p  pSo I first backed up my data with a backup application on an external hard drive. Then I created a CD with the Ubuntu OS on it to install it within the live system.p  pWhen I came up to Ubuntu asking me how to install, I chose Alongside Windows 8.1. Linux installed itself on my machine, I rebooted and ended up inside the GRUB bootloader asking me, wether I wanted to start up windows or linux. I chose windows, just to test wether it was still working. It did. I needed a USB port, so I removed the backup hard drive, what was connected to my computer the whole process. Later I rebootet my computer to test the linux installation.p  pAnd then horror began. Grub did not loaded itself, but crashed with the error No Such device [device no] entering rescue mode And I got a simple console without even a help command. Thank you for that, GRUB.p  pI reconnected my external drive... no effect UEFI told me, I can choose different devices, but I always ended up with rescue GRUB. I booted up from the live CD and researched my partitions. When linux told me, that the only linux partition was found on my external hard drive, I realised what had happened... I attached my hard drive to another USB port and rebooted again. Now grub was working again and let me choose my OS of desire.p  pSo How can I bypass GRUB, to load up windows again, without the hard drive attached. And how do I uninstall linux from my hard drive AND install it safely on my internal hard drivep

Negative 16957 pI have a list of numpy arrays.  I want to convert the list of arrays to a string.  So that there will be a long string of arrays like [ stuff ], [ stuff2 ], etc.  Each array has 192 elements.  Conversion works when I do strmyList if the list has 5 arrays or less.  If it has 6 arrays, I get back truncated arrays with ellipses.  Why is this  How can I stop it.  p  pI have examined the arrays themselves and they do not in fact contain ellipses, they contain the correct values.p  pI further looked into it and if I do something like strmyList[05] it works on the first 5 arrays, but that 6th array always goes to ellipses. Note that this is not just ellipses when printing to screen either, Im saving this variable and when I look at the saved text it has the ellipses.p
