Positive 14456 pIm developing an ArcGIS addin dont worry, this is not a GIS question and wondered if there was an easier way to increment the version number.p  pAt the moment, you have to edit the AssemblyVersion in AssemblyInfo.cs in both the project and the unit test project, the Config.esriaddinx an XML file containing addin details, and we have a config JSON file that contains a version too. So thats four places to change the version number. I know that you can use environment variables like VERSION in code, but this doesnt work in AssemblyInfo.cs because version must be a constant. Also its unlikely to work in project XML and JSON files.p  pIs the best approach a prebuild batch script that does a regex find and replace Or just a script I can run from the commandline outside of visual studio. This is probably what Ill end up doing.p

Negative 14456 pIm surfing through the wonderful blog maintained by Scott Stevenson, and Im trying to understand a fundamental ObjectiveC concept of assigning delegates the assign property vs retain. Note, the both are the same in a garbage collected environment. Im mostly concerned with a nonGC based environment eg iPhone.p  pDirectly from Scotts blogp  pThe assign keyword will generate a setter which assigns the value to the instance variable directly, rather than copying or retaining it. This is best for primitive types like NSInteger and CGFloat, or objects you dont directly own, such as delegates.p  pWhat does it mean that you dont directly own the delegate object I typically retain my delegates, because if I dont want them to go away into the abyss, retain will take care of that for me. I usually abstract UITableViewController away from its respective dataSource and delegate also. I also retain that particular object. I want to make sure it never goes away so my UITableView always has its delegate around.p  pCan someone further explain wherewhy Im wrong, so I can understand this common paradigm in ObjectiveC 2.0 programming of using the assign property on delegates instead of retainp  pThanksp

This makes sense as I am not shutting them anywhere.p  pBut how do I do this There must be an event that is called at this point but I cant find what it is anywhere.p  pNotifications such as codeapplicationWillTerminatecode and so on are only called when the application actually is terminating not when the close button has been pressed. p  pI guess Im looking for something similar to the Windows codeWMCLOSEcode type messages.p

Negative 14456 pI am writing an audio player for OSX. One view is a custom view that displays a waveform. The waveform is stored as a instance variable of type codeNSImagecode with an codeNSBitmapImageRepcode. The view also displays a progress indicator a thick red line. Therefore, it is updatedredrawn every 30 milliseconds.p  pSince it takes a rather long time to recalculate the image, I do that in a background thread after every window resize and update the displayed image once the new image is ready. In the meantime, the original image is scaled to fit the view like thisp  precode The drawing rectangle is slightly smaller than the view, defined by    the two margins. NSRect drawingRect drawingRect.origin  NSMakePointsideEdgeMarginWidth, topEdgeMarginHeight drawingRect.size  NSMakeSize[self bounds].size.width2sideEdgeMarginWidth,                               [self bounds].size.height2topEdgeMarginHeight [waveform drawInRectdrawingRect             fromRectNSZeroRect            operationNSCompositeSourceOver             fraction1] codepre  pThe view makes up the biggest part of the window. During live resize, audio starts choking. Selecting the big graphic card on my Macbook Pro makes it less bad, but not by much. CPU utilization is somewhere around 2040 during live resizes.br Instruments suggests that rescalingredrawing of the image is the problem. Once I stop resizing the window, CPU utilization goes down and audio stops glitching.p  pI already tried to disable image interpolation to speed up the drawing like thisp  precode[[NSGraphicsContext currentContext]      setImageInterpolationNSImageInterpolationNone] codepre  pThat helps, but audio still chokes during live resizes.p  pDo you have an idea how to improve thisbr The main thing is to prevent the audio from choking.p

And second problem that rises is that if the entity has notifyevents, other parts of the application will be affected with faulty data.p  pA third thing with that approach is if the user edits some data and then cancels the edit, how do I revert to the old values  The entity might not come from a DB so reloading the entity ist possible in all cases.p  pAnother solution is to make some sort of copyclone of the entity in question and use the copy as MVPmodel, but then it might get troublesome if the entity has a large object graph.p  pAnyone has some tips about these problemsp

What I am wondering is what type of class do I use for each object so that I can successfully implement these methods and how do I implement that particular class.  Note that this game only executes on a user interaction with one of these objects, meaning I dont need a realtime implementation.p  pMy research seems to point in the direction that each screen object needs to be a view object and that I need to place add each view object inside a viewgroup container.

Negative 14456 pIm working on a Magento storefront for a client.  They use dropshippers, so a single zip code doesnt do us much help.  We do have it set for the most common zip code from which the client ships, so, in many cases, its ok.p  pHowever, in some cases, there is a different origin zip code that needs to be used.  In more rare cases, we will have multiple origin zip codes.  When there is a zip that differs from the main one, we have stored this in an attribute called origin zip creative, huhp  pWhere should I be looking to make the modifications  Were only using the UPS shipping method, and what Im looking to do is, before calculating shipping, to grab whatever origin zips may be in the cart I think weve got this part, but then, depending on the results, I may need to iterate through the shipping calculation and add the values together  i.e. in the case they order one product with an origin zip code, and another product without an origin zip code, it would have to calculate the first, then the second, and then add them together.p  pIf someone could point us in the correct direction of which php files or classes well need to modify, I would greatly appreciate it.p
Negative 14456 pI am looking to do something a little, well interesting I think would be a good word. I was wondering if there was a way to catch the text associated with a stack trace from a build currently I use ANT to build using the javac task.p  pA little history, I am using a CI server, CruiseControl, and want to write an adapter that will catch the stack trace from a failed build, and allow for me to parse out which files caused the build to fail from a javac task call. So for example, if code was checked into a repository that had a method signature from another class in it, but that class was never added to the repository, the javac task would fail with a cannot find symbol exception in the class. I want to be able to read the stack trace to get the class that caused the build failure.p  pAny ideas on how to do this I would prefer not to have to just read in the log file and parse it out manually I feel like there should be a better way but if there isnt then I can just go that route as well.p

Negative 14456 pIm using a sheet to ask the user some information for an operation that the application performs. The sheet has some 10 to 15 options split into 4 tabs, so its a relatively clean UI that the rest of the program needs to know before proceeding.p  pRight now, I have a separate window controller class for the sheet called codeSheetControllercode. SheetController has a delegate property and the main controller, codeAppControllercode, is set as the delegate.p  pWhen the user clicks OK in the sheet the delegate is notified and a method called codedidClickDoneidsender withParametersidparameterscode is executed. codeparametercode is a object that contains various properties from the sheet. My question is, is this a good approach to handling Sheets and returning data from themp  pSecondly, one thing that bothers me is that the codeparametercode is just a dead object  it only has accessor methods. It doesnt do any manipulation on them as its entire purpose is to carry the data to the main controller, which in turn passes the information to the Model of the program. And, unless Im missing something, shouldnt I just declare codeparametercode to be a normal C struct Or is there an advantage of using an object for this sort of purposep  pEDIT Would a passing an NSDictionary be a good compromise I could save the returned information with their keys in the dictionary and simply pass it.p

For instance, if I focus on the dropdown and type 1992, it will go to that option. p  pI am wondering if there is a way to enable a two digit year navigation, so that I can type 92, rather than the full 1992. p  pThe other catch is that if you type a two digit year, then it would go to the most recent year in the dropdown. So if I type 09, then it would go to 2009 rather than 1909. p  pAnyone have any example or an idea on the best way to implement this with JQuery p  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netflynfishP2Xct1 relnofollowJSFiddle here.a p  pUPDATE It must work with Firefox 5 and IE7. p

Negative 14456 pWhen using the CSS codezoomcode property, how can I convince the browser to use nearest neighbor, instead of bilinear or any other more advanced zooming algorithmsp  pMy setup is a div that contains a canvas, and the div gets its zoom set via JavaScript to be codeltdiv stylezoom3200gt...ltdivgtcode and to get nearest neighbor, I am using codeimagerendering webkitoptimizecontrastcode in my CSS. The app is available a hrefhttpwww.lovetopixel.comherea z zooms in, shiftz zooms back out, and my css is a hrefhttpwww.lovetopixel.comltp.csshereap  pHere is the desired effect in Chrome on OSX zoom is set to 3200 img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comJMpbI.png altzoom on OSXChrome using nearest neighborp  pBut here is the same thing in Chrome on Windows 7 img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comNdY5w.png altzoom on WindowsChrome not using nearest neighborp  pIn both cases it is vanilla Chrome version 15.x.x out of the box, no experimental flags are turned on.p  pstrongHow can I convince Chrome on Windows to use nearest neighbor For that matter, how can I convince all browsersstrong Safari also does not use nearest neighbor so far the app only works in WebKit based browsersp  pThe CSS codeimagerenderingcode property does affect ChromeOSX and gives me the desired effect. But ChromeWindows and Safari5.1OSX both seem to completely ignore it. Something tells me Im just out of luck, but I figured Id ask.p  pUsing codezoomcode on the div container is so simple and works beautifully in ChromeOSX, if I must resort to scaling my canvases internally, I can do that too. But would prefer the literally one line of code solution if possiblep  pstrongUPDATEstrong I have found the use of codeimagerendering optimizeSpeedcode helps. However it seems finicky in ChromeWindows. If I set it on too many elements I initially tried, my containers and all canvases, it doesnt take effect. But if I apply it to just codecanvascode, I get 98 of the way there.p  pNow my problem is the first time I draw while zoomed in, it works perfectly, all other subsequent drawing actions are fuzzy while they are taking place, then revert to the correct nearestneighbor afterwards my app draws into a scratch canvas first, then applies the drawing to the real canvas. There is something odd about the scratch canvas where Chrome insists on using bilinear. I think with some digging I can resolve that.p  pstrongUPDATE2strong It seems like codeimagerenderingcode on ChromeWindows just isnt implemented well and is a bit buggy. I can now confirm that the values codeoptimizeSpeedcode and codeoptimizeQualitycode are not supported on ChromeWindows. If you set imagerendering to them, Chrome will ignore the set. ChromeWindows does recognize codewebkitoptimizecontrastcode, however it does not use it consistently. Chrome will flip between what looks to be a bilinear scaling algorithm and nearestneighbor almost at random. Ive not been able to consistently get Chrome to use nearestneighbor.p  pI tried a build of Chromium 17 on Windows and it behaves the same way.p  pFirefox 8.0.1 is looking pretty promising though as it does seem to honor codemozcrispedgescode quite well. Originally I was targeting Chrome as my ideal browser for this app, I might just switch over to Firefox.p  pIn the end, it seems like proper support for codeimagerenderingcode is in the pipeline for Chrome, just not quite there yet. WebKit itself claims to fully support all imagerendering values, but Im guessing the build of WebKit that Chrome uses hasnt quite updated to this new fix.p

But I didn find any service that fulfill all requirements defined, so I have to came up with my own ideas. I was thinking about building up a platform which uses youtube as video hoster. I can easily embed the youtube videos on my website, but I cant encrypt the videolink, because the youtube Iframe itself contains it. I need to hide the source, so that the user can not easily figure it out.

The user is indicates that the repair is Check Battery which inserts data into the Repair table under the Repairname field VARCHAR50 and a short description of the repair which inserts data into the Repair table under the Repairdescrip field TEXT.  The user is also able to specify the particular parts involved in the Check Battery repair, which may be one or many, but in this case it is only 2 different parts, an Alternator and Battery.   In a different entry a user specifies three parts for a different repair.p  pHow would one go about creating this RepairParts table in phpMyAdmin or MySQL so that the database keeps track of the particular Parts necessary for the Repair  What Engine should be used MyISAM or INNODB p  pFrom what Ive read about normalization of databases, I seem to have the correct way to structure my tables, but I cant figure out how to make the RepairPartItem field to store data the way I want.  Specifically, assuming I have broken out my tables and their fields in an acceptable manner, how would I get the RepairPartItem field to start numbering at 1 for each different Repairid field entry, and to count up for each row with the same Repairid with a different Partid and not allowing duplicate rows with the same Repairid and Partidp  pFrom what Ive read about normalization this seems to be the correct way to structure my tables, but I cant figure out how to do make the RepairPartItem field work correctly.  p  pIm a relative newbie to MySQL and PHP, and am just trying to set up the databases before getting into the PHP side of the equation.p
Negative 14456 pSince C supports codeInt8code, codeInt16code, codeInt32code and codeInt64code, why did the designers of the language choose to define codeintcode as an alias for codeInt32code instead of allowing it to vary depending on what the native architecture considers to be a codewordcodep  pI have not had any specific need for codeintcode to behave differently than the way it does, I am only asking out of pure encyclopedic interest. p  pI would think that a 64bit RISC architecture could conceivably exist which would most efficiently support only 64bit quantities, and in which manipulations of 32bit quantities would require extra operations. Such an architecture would be at a disadvantage in a world in which programs insist on using 32bit integers, which is another way of saying that C, becoming the language of the future and all, essentially prevents hardware designers from ever coming up with such an architecture in the future.p  pStackOverflow does not encourage speculating answers, so please answer only if your information comes from a dependable source.

They were using a wait for .active  0 to determine that all ajax requests had finished before proceeding. However, with certain partial view loads, the active variable was not decrementing, thereby making the automation very difficult.p  pI investigated and found that the issue only arose when partial views were being loaded that had an include of a .js file and were loaded via an ajax call.

Negative 14456 pAlthough the question title appears a bit subjective I am sure there is not a lot to discuss. I am currently working on a MVC project where I am using TemData container in some areas. When I read the documentation in MSDN, it appears that using TempData creates a session and that once read the data we store in tempdata is gone. I am OK with this concept, however the thing that kept bugging me this morning is that how does it behave when you host your application in a Web Farm environment. p  pWhat if a GET request is passed to SERVER 1, which creates a TempData and the subsequent GETPOST request is sent to SERVER 2.p  pI might be completely wrong with this assumption but I just need a clarification on this thinggy.  p  pAny input will be deeply appreciated...p  pCheersp
Negative 14456 pThis is my casep  pI have 6 servers across US and Europe. All servers are on a load balancer. When you visit the website www.example.com its pointing on the load balancer IP address and from their you are redirect to one of the servers. Currently, if you visit the website from Germany for example, you are transfered randomly in one of the server. You could transfer to the Germany server or the server in San Fransisco.p  pI am looking for a way to redirect users to the nearest server based on their location but without changing url. So I am strongNOTstrong looking of having many urls such as www.example.com, www.example.co.uk, www.example.dk etcp  pI am looking for something like a CDN where you retrieve your files from the nearest server  so I can get rid of the load balancer because if it crashes, the website does not respond p  pFor examplep  pIf you are from uk, redirect to IP 53.235.xx.xxx If you are from west us, redirect to IP .... if you are from south europe, redirect to IP ... etcp  pDNSMadeeasy offers a feature similar to this but they are charging a 600 dollars upfront price and for a startup that doesnt know if that feature will work as expected or there is no trial version we cannot afford a hrefhttpwww.dnsmadeeasy.comenterprisednsglobaltrafficdirectorhttpwww.dnsmadeeasy.comenterprisednsglobaltrafficdirectorap  pWhat is another way of doing thisp  pAlso another question on the current setup. Even with 6 servers all connected to the load balancer, if the load balancer has lag issues, it takes everything with it, right or if by any change it goes down, the website does not respond. So what is the best way to eliminate that downtime so that if one server IP address does not respond, move to the next as a load balancer would do but load balancers can have issues themselvesp

Negative 14456 pI have an assignment and I was wondering if you could help. For part of the question I am required to analyse a system log. The log contains information such as time and date, if root access was attempted for and from what ip address the attempt came from. p  pMy question is how do I loop through the log and pull out the ip addresses. p  precodemyFile  opensyslog,r  for line in myFile.readlines listofline  line.split  codepre  pSo here Ive split the list up but how can I loop through trying to locate an ip address. Previously I have used locations but this isnt practical as it only looks for one address. I want it to search through and find all addresses so would that mean looking for strings with a certain length e.g. xxx.xxx.xx.xx as the ip address and specify that I am looking for numeric values. p  pedit p  precodeJan 10 093207 j4be03 sshd[3876] pamunixsshdauth authentication failure logname uid0 euid0 ttyssh ruser rhost218.241.173.35  userroot Jan 10 093209 j4be03 sshd[3876] Failed password for root from 218.241.173.35 port 47084 ssh2 Jan 10 093217 j4be03 sshd[3879] pamunixsshdauth authentication failure logname uid0 euid0 ttyssh ruser rhost218.241.173.35  userroot Jan 10 093219 j4be03 sshd[3879] Failed password for root from 218.241.173.35 port 47901 ssh2    Jan 10 093226 j4be03 sshd[3881] pamunixsshdauth authentication failure logname uid0 euid0 ttyssh ruser rhost218.241.173.35  userroot Jan 10 093229 j4be03 sshd[3881] Failed password for root from 218.241.173.35 port 48652 ssh2 codepre  pIve been told to ignore the line containing codepamunixcode and focus on the line containing Failed password for root as they are duplicate entries.

Negative 14456 pI am a c games programmer and have been creating games at a commercial level for the past year. The game engine my company use currently has no functionality to show video SWF,AVI, ETC.. within the game. The engine uses OpenGL and we want to migrate over to a DirectX based engine, so I have put a design together to create on. The engine doesnt need to have huge functionality as its only 2D. I have the design set out for the standard parts of the engine but I was wandering if you know the best means of adding this kind of functionality into an engine. I have looked around and DirectShow sounds like it could do the trick. Do you know and good resources for learning how to use it. Or if thats the wrong approach, what other means could this be done.p  pThanks a lot, All the best,p  pMartin.p

The contents of each of the event handlers is EXTREMELY similar, and could be easily parameterized into a factory method.  The only thing preventing me from doing that is that each delegate needs to share the reference to the codesharedcode variable.

Negative 14456 pWe are using the COSIII RTOS of Micrium with a RX62N of Renesas.p  pWe built a system where we have to dynamicly alloc and free data. We found out the functions strongmallocstrong and strongfreestrong are not working well with the RTOS. However the RTOS has a custom function for this the strongMemHeapAllocstrong function. This function allocates some memory of the RTOS made emheapem. Problem is that it does not have a free function, probably because everything goes into a strongheap poolstrong. p  pIn the RTOS it is also possible to make a pool. Problem of this pool is that all the containing blocks need to be the same size. Since we are allocating and freeing different sizes, this is not a good solution for us.p  pWe found a document which describes the memory RTOS functions a hrefhttpwww.2shared.comdocumentw4jSSx96uCLIBManual.html relnofollowHEREa Chapter 4 describes the functions.p  pDoes somebody have any idea how we could fix this problem p  pSome solutions we allready hadp  ul listrongMake all the blocks sizes the same as the biggest allocation.strong We have a lot of overhead since the smallest and biggest allocation differ a lot.li listrongDont do a free.strong This is no solution, there will be a memory leak. li ul  pHope somebody can help us.

Negative 14456 pIm preparing myself for the exams and I just found out a requirements specification on a system and decided it would be a good idea to practice my skills on it. I want to apologize for my english, the below text is translated from Greek.p  pThis is the specificationp  pIts about a system that sells tickets to customers at the cinema.p  ol liThe cinema has 4 halls.li liEach hall can have up to three shows every day and each show can be different.li liThe customer can buy tickets for any show.li liThe tickets of the cinema can be of 4 different kindsa,b,c,d.li liThe business of the cinema provides the customers with a special ticket whose owner can attend 10 shows in a period of 6 months.li liEach ticket includes information about the name of each customer.li liImmediately after the customer buys a ticket, a seat reservation takes place.li liIn case of a problem the customer can ask the cashier to cancel the reservation.li liIf a cancellation takes place, the customer will get his money back. However this will happen only if the customer cancels his reservation 2 hours or more before the start of the show.li liThe system supports the seat reservation and the sale of tickets. Also it can show the cinemas program at a specific day. In addition the system can give to the management reports that are associated with the amount of people who reserved seats and the total amount of tickets that are sold.li ol  pThis is my use case diagramp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comMfp9F.png altenter image description herep  pFirst of all we need a primary actor who is going to be the Customer. The customer can buy tickets so we need a use case called Buy a ticket.p  pThis use case will include a secondary actor which is the cashier. This is because the Customer initiates the use case and the cashier responds to the Customers actions.p  pNow I had a problem with the use of strongincludestrong and strongextendstrong. I researched a lot about them and Im not sure if I use them correctly here thats why I wanted to post this question.p  pSince after the customer buys a ticket a seat reservation takes place, then I should include a use case called Seat reservation. Also I use extend in cases when the customer wants to cancel the show. The reason why I use extend is because it strongemMIGHTemstrong happen, its something that extends the functionality of the Buy a ticket use case. p  pThen we have another actor about the management and also two use cases about the 2 different kinds of reports.p  pSo my question is, is my use case correct Is the use of the extend and include correct What changes would you suggestp  pThanks in advance and sorry for the long question.p

Negative 14456 pI want to preface this question with two things so I can narrow down where my actual question isp  pa Ive done software dev before, though never for androidp  pb Im familiar with PKI and encryptions and hashing and digital signatures and blah blah blahp  pThat being said Im having trouble tracking down more information about where and how Android verifies app creators. Ive heard a lot of different information so Im trying to synthesize to get a better idea of the workflow.p  pI know that every app developer gets their own privatepublic key pair and they sign their apps by hashing the APK with SHA1 most of the time if Im not mistaken and there you go. You upload it and I believe the public key goes in META INF inside the APK. This much I understand. p  pMy question is how this relates to when a user downloads the app itself. I know the phone checks to make sure that the app is validly signed, and that the signature also has information about author and etc included. But Ive also read that apps are self signed and that Google Play or whatever theyre calling the Market now doesnt implement a CA, and that theres no identity authentication But my question is what, then, stops people from uploading an app under another developers name crowdsourcing asidep  pIf the phone only checks for valid signatures does that imply that the only means of authentication is done when the app is uploaded And if thats the case how does the app market check it Is it the usual  use the private key on file and verify the signature Or does the developer have to provide the market with their private key to authenticatep

Negative 14456 pI have a synchronization issue regarding a bind request and a upstream handler that receives a codechannelBoundcode event.

I dont like this solution because it ties up an IO worker.p  pSolution 2 Make codeMyClientHandlercode in to a bidirectional handler and get the attachment using a codeThreadLocalcode in a codebindRequestedcode downstream callback.

Negative 14456 pI am working on porting an application from windows mobile to android and I have run into a bit of a problem. The existing application uses the MVP pattern and has distinct presenter classes, which are to be reused in the port its quite an extensive application and rewriting it just isnt possible, and the C code is all being reused using mono for android. These take a view implementing an interface, which in android I have achieved by creating activities which implement the appropriate interface, instantiating a presenter and passing themselves as an argument. This all seems to work fine for our purposes, or was until ice cream sandwich came out and I tried to implement it using fragments.p  pQuite a few of the activities utilise tabs, and in order to use the action bar and some of the other new features I am trying to convert the tabbed activities to tabbed fragments with a viewpager, and this is where I am hitting some problems. From what I have read implementing each tab as a fragment seems to be the preferred method, but I am confused as to how exactly I can allow the presenter to communicate with the fragment through the activity. At the moment the presenter calls the activitys interface methods which then directly access spinners, textviews etc to get and set values as required.As each of these ui elements are declared in the activity this is trivial. If I move all of these ui elements to fragments however it doesnt seem I can access them without implementing a whole new set of interfaces between each activity and fragment. I have tried generating a reference in the activity to ui elements in the fragments by getting the fragment root view and then finding the view I want inside that, however the viewpager doesnt always load the fragments so this wont work, and even when it has loaded them the layout doesnt get inflated until the activity is in the running state, so I always get null values returned. p  pI know its a bit of a strange question, but how can I go about allowing my presenter classes to interact with the ui elements now stored in separate fragment tabs I feel like I must be going about it in completely the wrong way but I just cant see how it should be done, so if anyone could offer some advice on how I could go about it that would be great.p  pThanks very much p
Negative 14456 pI have an inapplication service which allows me to feed it messages from various sources, which will be put into a simple list. The service, running in its own thread, will, periodically, process all messages in the list into various files one file for each source, which are then managed for size.p  pMy question is about the proper way to check for messages and performing a lock around the code which accesses the list. There are only two places which access the list one is where a message is added to the list and the other is where the messages are dumped from the list into a processing list.p  pAdding a message to the listp  precodePublic Sub WriteMessageByVal messageProvider As IEventLogMessageProvider, ByVal logLevel As EventLogLevel, ByVal message As String     SyncLock SyncLockObject         LogMessages.AddNew EventLogMessagemessageProvider, logLevel, Now, message     End SyncLock End Sub codepre  pProcessing the listp  precodeDim localList As New ListOf EventLogMessage SyncLock SyncLockObject     If LogMessages.Count gt 0 Then         localList.AddRangeLogMessages         LogMessages.Clear     End If End SyncLock   process list into files... codepre  pMy questions are should I do a double check when I am processing the list, see below And why Or why not And are there any dangers in accessing the lists count property outside of the lock Are either of the methods better or more efficient And why Or why notp  precodeDim localList As New ListOf EventLogMessage If LogMessages.Count gt 0 Then     SyncLock SyncLockObject         If LogMessages.Count gt 0 Then             localList.AddRangeLogMessages             LogMessages.Clear         End If     End SyncLock End If   process list into files... codepre  pI understand that in this particular case, it may not matter if I do a double check given the fact that, outside of the processing function, the list can only grow. But this is my working example and Im trying to learn about the finer details of threading. p  pThank you in advance for any insightsp  hr  pAfter some further research, thank you the coon, and some experimental programming, I have some further thoughts.p  pConcerning the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.threading.readerwriterlockslim.aspx relnofollow titleReaderWriterLockSlimReaderWriterLockSlima, I have the following example which seems to work fine. It allows me to read the number of messages in the list without interfering with other code which may be trying to read the number of messages in the list, or the messages themselves. And when I desire to process the list, I can upgrade my lock to write mode, dump the messages into a processing list and process them outside of any readwrite locks, thus not blocking any other threads which may want to add, or read, more messages.p  pPlease note, that this example uses a simpler construct for the message, a String, as opposed to the previous example which used a Type along with some other metadata. p  precodePrivate ReadWriteLock As New Threading.ReaderWriterLockSlim  Private Sub Process      create local processing list     Dim processList As New ListOf String     Try          enter read lock mode         ReadWriteLock.EnterUpgradeableReadLock          if there are any messages in the global list          then dump them into the local processing list         If Messages.Count gt 0 Then             Try                  upgrade to a write lock to prevent others from writing to                  the global list while this reads and clears the global list                 ReadWriteLock.EnterWriteLock                 processList.AddRangeMessages                 Messages.Clear             Finally                  alway release the write lock                 ReadWriteLock.ExitWriteLock             End Try         End If     Finally          always release the read lock         ReadWriteLock.ExitUpgradeableReadLock     End Try      if any messages were dumped into the local processing list, process them     If processList.Count gt 0 Then         ProcessMessagesprocessList     End If End Sub  Private Sub AddMessageByVal message As String     Try          enter write lock mode         ReadWriteLock.EnterWriteLock         Messages.Addmessage     Finally          always release the write lock         ReadWriteLock.ExitWriteLock     End Try End Sub codepre  pThe only problem I see with this technique is that the developer must be diligent about acquiring and releasing the locks. Otherwise, deadlocks will occur.p  pAs to whether this is more efficient than using a a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrary3a86s51t28vvs.10029.aspx relnofollow titleSyncLockSyncLocka, I really could not say. For this particular example and its usage, I believe either would suffice. I would not do the double check for the very reasons the coon gave about reading the count while someone else is changing it. Given this example, the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrary3a86s51t28vvs.10029.aspx relnofollow titleSyncLockSyncLocka would provide the same functionality. However, in a slightly more complex system, one where multiple sources might read and write to the list, the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.threading.readerwriterlockslim.aspx relnofollow titleReaderWriterLockSlimReaderWriterLockSlima would be ideal.p  hr  pConcerning the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarydd267312.aspx relnofollowBlockingCollectiona list, the following example works like the one above.p  precodePrivate Messages As New System.Collections.Concurrent.BlockingCollectionOf String  Private Sub Process      process each message in the list     For Each item In Messages         ProcessMessageMessages.Take     Next End Sub  Private Sub AddMessageByVal message As String      add a message to the global list     Messages.Addmessage End Sub codepre  pSimplicity itselfp

Negative 14456 pThis sounds counterproductive, but its not I have a div element which only contains the ad  this basically just gives the ad some padding and surrounds it with a nice borderbox. p  pI know a certain percentage of my potential users will use adblock, so when they will visit the site, theyll see the main content and a weird elongated div below it with seemingly no purpose. Are there any keywords which such ad blockers look for in divs, which I could use to ensure that if ads are blocked, the entire div is invisible p  pIf not, perhaps theres a way to display a message to let ad blockers know what the div is usually for Im avoiding this because it seems a little passive aggressive and if users want to block ads, they should have just as good an experience as the majority of users.p  pThanks for any help or advice.p

Negative 14456 pI have to develop a tool for automatic conversion from one Elearning standard Content Package to another, as of now Ive considered IMS and SCORM but I didnt completely understand what could be the best reason for developing an automatic conversion tool from IMS to SCORM or viceversa. I mean what benefits can one avail from such tool This is the reason which Ive got in one technical paper. Can anyone please explain and clarify this or tell me some good reason behind developing such a tool  p  blockquote   pIMS [6] and SCORM [7] specications share many of their   characteristics but also have some key differences in the   representation of the structure of the learning content. Other   important issue to be considered is the extension of these systems and   the huge number of organizations that use them. This situation leads   to the fact that the same contents are created, maintained, modied   and so on [8]. These are usually not identical copies, but the   contents are the same and aim to the same learning objective. So it   would be useful to share the work among the organization to avoid   repeating the work over and over again. This would save time and   resources and would lead to high quality contents. The main obstacle   to get this is the, previously presented, existence of different types   of models for contents. From all of this, we can infer the utility of   automatic conversion between formats. This conversion will allow the   interaction between learning platforms at a high level of automa   tion.

Negative 14456 pFor a project we are trying to create a shared object file that exports a set of functions specified in codelibname.exportscode. Of course we know that the object files from which the code.socode file gets linked have to be created using codefPICcode, so that has been taken care of. We then combined the object files into an archive named codelibname.acode. This should now be the basis for the code.socode file to be created  or so was the idea.p  pWere passing codelibname.exportscode to coderetainsymbolsfilecode, so the expected behavior was that the linker would pull in any of the code.acode members relevant to those symbols.p  pHowever, the output of codenm libname.socode is empty. On the other hand grepping in codenm libname.acode shows that the relevant symbols named in codelibname.exportscode exist in the code.acode members.p  pNow I stumbled over codewholearchivecode and thus adjusted the command line fromp  precodegcc o libname.so shared Wl,z,defs,retainsymbolsfile,libname.exports,L. libname.a lc codepre  ptop  precodegcc o libname.so shared Wl,z,defs,retainsymbolsfile,libname.exports,L.,wholearchive,libname.a,nowholearchive lc codepre  pwhich appears to have the intended effect of including emallem the object files from the code.acode although the size difference is strange. However, codenm libname.socode still gives me no output.p  pHow can I use the archive file to create a shared object with only the symbols named in codelibname.exportscode visiblep  pUnfortunately a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6263780How to create a shared object file from static librarya doesnt quite answer my question.p  pNote before you ask. The idea behind using the code.acode file as input is because it makes it easy to use a pattern rule in codeGNUmakefilecode and because the code.acode file with codefPICcode is needed regardless. There shouldnt be any difference between linking the individual object files versus the archive file.p

I am trying to perform a PCA for a very large dataset of about 700 samples columns and  4,00,000 locus rows. I wish to plot samples in the biplot and hence want to consider all of the 4,00,000 locus to calculate the principal components. p  pI did try using codeprincompcode, but I get the following error which says, p  precodeError in princomp.defaulttransposed.data, cor  TRUE   princomp can only be used with more units than variables codepre  pI checked with the forums and i saw that in the cases where there are less units than variables, it is better to use codeprcompcode than codeprincompcode, so i tried that as well, but i again get the following error,p  precodeError in cortransposed.data  allocMatrix too many elements specified codepre  pSo I want to know if any of you could suggest me any other good option which could be best suited for my very large data. I am a beginner for statistics, but i did read about how PCA works. I want to know if there are any other easytouse R packages or tools to perform thisp

Negative 14456 pI have a situation where a 2008 server with IIS7 has been application level compromised and is sending spam from port 25.

The PID sending the data on port 25 is simply inetinfo.exe so this isnt much use either.p  pI would like to identify what file is sending this email, can anyone think of a way to do this p

Negative 14456 pConsider a worker process which searches the web for particular data. Another process is needed to index the results of the first process for later use. The indexing part involves writing raw data search results to a huge distributed HBase repository in a particular way. I cant judge about the speed of these two processes compared to each other. We may have a situation in which one of these systems is temporarily down and needs to take the task where it is put upon its wakeup. Im using JavaEE. Currently, this is the way I have in mind to implement this.p  ol liThe first process stores the result of its search in a MySQL database and sends a message containing the IDs of the new rows it has put in the table.li liThe MOM wakes up the second process to consume the new raw data stored in the MySQL database.li liThe second process clears up the MySQL table when it finishes indexing the data in the real database HBase.li ol  pI need expert comments on my design to verify its appropriateness.

In web.config they are referenced as an external file like so. p  precodeltsearchForm configSourceConfigsearchForm.config gt codepre  pWe have a custom configuration handler that inherits from IConfigurationSectionHandler.

No other point in the program touches these values. p  pstrongThe Issuestrongp  pWhat will happen intermittently is that the drop down boxes on our webpage suddenly have only one value e.g. 2500 in the price box. Do note it is not completely empty, but usually most values are gone. We have had similar issues of external configs dropping almost completely and it causes null reference errors across the place. e.g. its still looking for a config thats supposed to be there, but it has been wiped from the face of the earth. p  pStopping the website, stopping the app pool, and then bringing everything up again fixes the issue. Which made me initially think it could be something with memory usage, and external configurations being the first thing it drops, but Im really unsure at this point. p  pAnother thing to note. We have an app pool restart in the early hours of the morning everyday.p  pAny help with this is much appreciated, even if its just a nudge into the right direction.

In the above I strongknowstrong the element name that I want to compare it to, strongbecause the element name is the same as the button name.strong However, now what I need to do is FIND the element name button name by getting the element of all elements that are codeBombcode in codecellscode.p  pIm not sure how to do this, I triedp  precodeforeach CellType Bomb in cells  codepre  pbut it doesnt do anything. I need to find all bomb in cells and return the element name. That way I can use that element name, convert it to string, and use my codeStringToButtoncode method to create a reference to the button.p  pThis is the way Im currently doing it, for reference, and to help you understand a little better, but take note this is NOT the way I want to continue doing it.

It developed on August22 from the monsoon trough in the northwestern Pacific Ocean, then moved to the northwest, intensifying into a powerful typhoon. On August26, the storm moved across the Amami Islands of Japan, causing two fatalities. Across Japan, the typhoon dropped torrential rainfall peaking at 902mm 35.5in in Tokushima Prefecture. After weakening slightly, Rusa made landfall on Goheung, South Korea with winds of 140kmh 85mph. It weakened while moving through the country, dropping heavy rainfall that peaked at 897.5mm 35.33in in Gangneung. A 24hour total of 880mm 35in in the city broke the record for the highest daily precipitation in the country. Over 17,000houses were damaged, and large areas of crop fields were flooded. In South Korea, Rusa killed at least 233people. The typhoon also dropped heavy rainfall in neighboring North Korea, leaving 26,000people homeless and killing three. Rusa also destroyed large areas of crops in the country already affected by ongoing famine conditions. Full article...

Negative 14456 pIm very new to network programming so bare with me.  So far I have a UDP clientserver that sends a message to a server in lower or uppercase. The server receives the message and relays it back with switched cases.  What I cant figure out is how I would instead of having the server relay it back to the first client, instead sending it to a client2.  if my client2 sends a message the server receives and sends it back to client2 and same thing with client1.  I want what client1 says to be sent to the server and then the server send that to client2.  Ive tried everything i can think of but cant figure out.  p  pServerp  precode Simple udp server   includeltstdio.hgt   printf includeltstring.hgt memset includeltstdlib.hgt exit0 includeltarpainet.hgt includeltsyssocket.hgt includeltctype.hgt  define BUFLEN 512  Max length of buffer define PORT 8888   The port on which to listen for incoming data  void diechar s      perrors exit1   int mainvoid  struct sockaddrin sime, siother, siother2  int s, i, slen  sizeofsiother , recvlen char buf[BUFLEN]  create a UDP socket if ssocketAFINET, SOCKDGRAM, IPPROTOUDP  1      diesocket    zero out the structure memsetchar  ampsime, 0, sizeofsime  sime.sinfamily  AFINET sime.sinport  htonsPORT sime.sinaddr.saddr  htonlINADDRANY  bind socket to port if binds , struct sockaddrampsime, sizeofsime   1      diebind   keep listening for data while1      printfWaiting for data...     fflushstdout      try to receive some data, this is a blocking call     if recvlen  recvfroms, buf, BUFLEN, 0, struct sockaddr  ampsiother, ampslen  1    read datagram from server socket              dierecvfrom           print details of the clientpeer and the data received     printfReceived packet from sdn, inetntoasiother.sinaddr, ntohssiother.sinport         printfData sn , buf      now reply to server socketthe client with the same data     if sendtos, buf, recvlen, 0, struct sockaddr ampsiother, slen  1              diesendto           closes return 0  codepre  pThe Clientp  precode Simple udp client   includeltstdio.hgt   printf includeltstring.hgt memset includeltstdlib.hgt exit0 includeltarpainet.hgt includeltsyssocket.hgt includeltctype.hgt  define SERVER 192.x.x.x define BUFLEN 512  Max length of buffer define PORT 8888   The port on which to send data  void diechar s  perrors exit1   int mainvoid  struct sockaddrin siother int s, s2, i, slensizeofsiother char buf[BUFLEN] char message[BUFLEN]  if  ssocketAFINET, SOCKDGRAM, IPPROTOUDP  1         create a client socket      diesocket   memsetchar  ampsiother, 0, sizeofsiother siother.sinfamily  AFINET siother.sinport  htonsPORT  if inetatonSERVER , ampsiother.sinaddr  0             Create datagram with server IP and port.      fprintfstderr, inetaton failedn     exit1   while1      printfEnter message       getsmessage       int a     char message2[BUFLEN]     fora0altBUFLEN1a                ifmessage[a] gt 97 ampamp message[a] lt 122            message2[a]  touppermessage[a]         else            message2[a]  tolowermessage[a]               if sendtos, message2, strlenmessage2 , 0 , struct sockaddr  ampsiother, slen1              diesendto            receive a reply and print it     clear the buffer by filling null, it might have previously received data     memsetbuf,0, BUFLEN     try to receive some data, this is a blocking call     if recvfroms, buf, BUFLEN, 0, struct sockaddr  ampsiother, ampslen  1         read datagram from client socket              dierecvfrom           putsbuf   closes return 0  codepre

Negative 14456 pI would like to interact as transparently as possible from the Java point of view with the controls of a JavaFX application from an application in a foreign language Prolog. Java and Prolog are connected by means of JNI and  I have already resolved the JNI interaction issues.p  pMy question isp  pWhat is the best way to instrument an arbitrary JavaFX application so I could inject code somewhere to invoke a routine in Prolog immediately after the primary a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavafx2apijavafxstageStage.html relnofollowStagea has been instantiated  so Prolog will be able to refer to the a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavafx2apijavafxsceneNode.html relnofollownodesa in the a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavafx2scenegraphjfxpubscenegraph.htm relnofollowScene Grapha of the Stage. p  pI think a hrefhttpfxexperience.comscenicview relnofollowScenic Viewa does something similar using a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase7docsapijavalanginstrumentpackagesummary.html relnofollowagentsa to instrument a bit an arbitrary JavaFX application that does not have any code related to Scenic View.p  pIn my problem, the objective is that the JavaFX interface could be created without JNI related code and having only presentation logic. The code starting the Prolog program with JNI should be somehow injected after the interface is ready. So the idea is to use Java only for the interface of my program and the core logic of my application is implemented in Prolog.p
Negative 14456 pI have a Question about Combobox in WPF C and incremental search. Maybe someone has a good idea how can i solve my Problem.p  pI have in my application an ObservableCollectin with all zipcodes and Citys in Switzerland. So this Collection has round 3500 Items. Now I tried to use a Combobox where i can start type my zipcode and after to letters the Popup will Show with this elements from the Collection. This filter a can make with Lampda, thats easy. My Problem is the Event from the Combobox. I tried with PreviewTextInput, but there a got everytime when the Events fired only one Letter and not the hole entred text. The other Problem by this solution is, that everytime where I load the new Collection to the ItemsSource, the market text in the TextEdit field changed to the new selectedItem.p  pI work now since 5 days on it, and maybe I cant see the forrest for the trees. So if someone has a good idea, pleas answer.p  pThanks and a Nice day.p

Negative 14456 pI am having a hard time figuring out the purpose behind some code that Ive come across. The code has a class Foo, which has an init method that takes multiple arguments. From what Ive learned of python so far, by calling Foobar, it will pass this string as a parameter to codeinitcode which I think is supposed to be the equivalent of a constructor, were this any other language. But the issue I am having is that the code I am looking at is calling codeFoo.initbarcode directly. What is the purpose of this I almost feel that I am missing some other purpose behind codeinitcode.p  pThanksp

So Service1 will have a reference to Service2 as well. p  precodeService Componentimmediate  true, name  Service1 public class Service1 implements ServiceInterface1      Referencename  Service2,bind  bindService2,       unbind  unbindService2, policy  ReferencePolicy.STATIC     ServiceInterface2 service2      protected void bindService2ServiceInterface2 service2          this.service2  service2           protected void unbindService2ServiceInterface2 service2          this.service2  null       codepre  pThis is how my Service2 looks likep  precodeService Componentimmediate  true, name  Service2 public class Service2 implements ServiceInterface2      .....  codepre  pThe problem I have is that I can see that the bind methods of Service1 and the Service Consumers are invoked by the OSGi container, but the object bound to the reference service1 in the service consumer does not have its service2 reference initialized. Which means when I use service1 object from a service consumer I get a Null Pointer Exception because the service1 object does not have a service2 object in it.  The object bound to service1 is not the same as what is used by the OSGi container to bind the reference service2. I want the same object used in all the service consumers. Can this be solvedp

Negative 14456 pHow do I call the next and previous MySQL records, without referring to the IDp  pIn my table, I have the following recordsp  ul liIDNO Autoincrement, primary keyli liTitleli liSlug unique keyli liDatali liDateTime Ymd Hisli ul  pI have two pages  index.php and single.php.  In index.php, my posts are called 10 at a time and ordered by codeDateTimecode.  Each entry links to single.php, where the single post is displayed, based on the URL variable codeslugcode and calling the appropriate record in my database.  I would like, since the pages are making up a simple blog, to call the next post and the previous post, still in codeDateTimecode order the next will link to the more recent post, the previous link to the less recent post.  Any advice on how to do this  If it was based on IDNO, I could do it, but since it isnt and the posts are not naturally in DateTime order, but are ordered as such in my query, I am at a loss.p  pThe query I use on each single.php page isp  pcodeSELECT  FROM siteposts WHERE slug  .GET[SLUG].codep  pI want the links to appear on this page, so I am only including that query.p
Negative 14456 pOK. So this is a hard one to explain, but I am replacing the type of a foreign key in a database. To do this I need to update the values in a table that references it. That is all fine and good, and nice and easy to do.p  pIm inserting this stuff into a temporary table which will replace the original table, but the codeinsertcode query isnt at all difficult, its the codeselectcode that I get the values from.p  pHowever, I also want to keep any entries where the original reference was NULL. Also not hard, I could use a Left Inner Join for that.br But were not done yet I dont want the entries for which there is no match in the second table. Ive been dinking around with this for 2 hours now, and am no closer to figuring this out than I am to the moon.p  pLet me give you an example data setp  precode  Inventory    Customer     ID   Cust   ID    Name     1     A     1     A      2     B     2     B      3     E     3     C      4   NULL    4     D     codepre  pLets say the database used to use the codeCustomer.Namecode field as its Primary Key, and I need to change it to a standard codeint identity1,1 not nullcode ID. Ive added the field with no issues in the Customer table, and kept the Name because I need it for other stuff. I have had no trouble with this in all the tables that do not allow NULLs, but since the Inventory table allows something to be associated with No customer, Im running into troubles.br If I did a left inner join, my results would bep  precode    Results     ID   Cust      1     1      2     2      3   NULL     4   NULL    codepre  pHowever, Inventory 3 was referencing a customer which does not exist. I want that to be filtered out. This database is my development database, where I hack, slash, and destroy things with wanton disregard for validity. So a lot of links in these tables are no longer valid. The next step is replicating this process in the betatesting environment, where bad records emshouldntem exist, but I cant guarantee that. So Id like to keep the filter, if possible.p  pThe query I have right now is using a subquery to find all rows in codeInventorycode whose codeCustIDcode either exists in codeCustomerscode, or codeis nullcode. It then tries to only grab the value from those rows which the subquery found. Heres the translated queryp  precodeinsert into results      ID,     Cust  select     inv.ID, cust.ID from Inventory inv, Customer cust where inv.ID in               select inv.ID from Inventory inv, Customer cust         where inv.Cust is null         or cust.Name  inv.Cust      and cust.Name  inv.Cust  codepre  pBut, as Im sure you can see, this query isnt right. Ive tried using 2, 3 subqueries, inner joins, left joins, bleh. The results of this query, and many others Ive tried that werent horribly, horribly wrong arep  precode    Results     ID   Cust      1     1      2     2     codepre  pWhich is essentially an innerjoin. Considering my actual data has around 1100 records which have NULL values in that field, I dont think truncating them is the answer.p  pThe answer Im looking for isp  precode    Results     ID   Cust      1     1      2     2      4   NULL    codepre  pThe trickiest part of this insert into select is the fact that Im looking to insert either a value from another table, or essentially a value from this table or the literal NULL. That just isnt something I know how to do Im still getting the hang of SQL.p  pSince Im inserting the results of this query into a table, Ive considered doing the insert using a select which leaves out the NULL values and unmatched records, then going back through and adding in all the NULL records, but I really want to learn how to do the more advanced queries like this.p  pSo do any of yous folks have any ideas Cause Im lost.p

Negative 14456 pstrongSummarystrong  Apache 2.4s modproxy does not seem to be passing the Authorization headers to PHPFPM. Is there any way to fix this p  pstrongLong versionstrong I am running a server with Apache 2.4 and PHPFPM. I am using APC for both opcode caching and user caching. As recommended by the Internet, I am using Apache 2.4s modproxyfcgi to proxy the requests to FPM, like thisp  precodeProxyPassMatch ..php fcgi127.0.0.19000foobar1 codepre  pThe setup works fine, except one thing APCs bundled apc.php, used to monitor the status of APC does not allow me to log in required for looking at user cache entries. When I click User cache entries to see the user cache, it asks me to log in, clicking on the login button displays the usual HTTP login form, but entering the correct login and password yields no success. This function is working perfectly when running with modphp instead of modproxy  phpfpm. p  pAfter some googling I found that other people had the same issue and figured out that it was because Apache was not passing the Authorization HTTP headers to the external FastCgi process. Unfortunately I only found a fix for modfastcgi, which looked like this p  precodeFastCgiExternalServer usrlibcgibinphp5fcgi host 127.0.0.19000 passheader Authorization codepre  pIs there an equivalent setting or some workaround which would also work with modproxyfcgi p

Negative 14456 pIm trying to implement MVC in Qt using a data model ported from another platform. I have several widgets onscreen that each listen to the same model to render the data. The user can also interact with these widgets, edit them, and thus push changes back into the model. p  pThe specific problem I have is that if my ported data model changes and I push data into eg a QTreeWidgetItem with setData, the widget emits an itemChanged signal.  This in turn triggers the controller code that is monitoring user edits, and causes it to push the same data back to the model. Unless I insert data comparison somewhere, I end up with an infinite loop. p  pIs there some way for the controller to quietly update the items data without emitting itemChanged Alternately, is there a better way to distinguish between user edits on a widget and programmatic changes  I am simply listening for itemChanged. p

Negative 14456 pIm having issues getting qwt 6.1.0 to work correctly with QtCreator 5.1.0.  It works correctly when I launch the stand alone version of QtDesigner and everything compiles and runs correctly when I use QtCreator.  However the designer that is built into QtCreator does not display the qwt widgets correctly on any forms nor give me the option to add new qwt widgets.p  pIm using Qt Creator 5.1.0 for Windows 64bit VS2012 with OpenGL.  Ive also downloaded and compiled Qwt 6.1.0 with the aforementioned QtCreator, by simply opening the qwt.pro file and compiling it.  Once it was compiled I used the nmake and nmake install commands from the visual studio command prompt as directed in the Qwt instructions a hrefhttpqwt.sourceforge.netqwtinstall.html relnofollowhttpqwt.sourceforge.netqwtinstall.htmla.  I then copied the qwtdesignerplugin.dll to the CQtQt5.1.0ToolsQtCreatorbinpluginsdesigner and CQtQt5.1.05.1.0msvc201264openglpluginsdesigner directories.p  pDoes anyone have any suggestions  I can manually launch QtDesigner and just compile with QtCreator, but it is kind of annoying to have to constantly switch back and forth and not be able to use the designer that is bundled into QtCreator.p  pEDIT 1  Ive also set the path environment variable to CQwt6.1.0lib as instructed in the qwt installation documenation.  Additionally Ive set the following in the Qt project file .pro that Im testing withp  precodeCONFIG   qwt INCLUDEPATH  CQwt6.1.0include LIBS  CQwt6.1.0lib codepre

Projects posted by the user and as projects that the user belongs to other projects the user is interested and wish to save or namely be a part of obviously a many to many relationship.p  pstrongProblemstrong Upon clicking a button Save button the user should be able to save this project by simply updating the join table or adding an association e.g User 45 is associated to project 8900.p  pWhen I tried to update the join table through the User model it wont save the data.p

Negative 14456 pI am wondering how I can efficiently manage formats in SAS for a reporting office that takes in data from various sources, some with proper lookup tables  metadata, and some without.p  pFor data sources that have proper metadata, joining tables for value descriptions works fine, but when metadata doesnt exist and needs to be maintained separately, how should that be done Some straightforward examplesideasp  ul liPlain code.sascode files with a native codePROC FORMATcode step that is maintained separately.li liExternal files e.g., Excel, CSV that are maintained separately and imported into SAS to create a format library.li liDatabase tables maintained separately that can be read from to create a format library.li ul  pIn addition to just the formatted values, managing value changes i.e., effective dates for certian values is also a concern.p  pAny help in conventions or standards that work well for this type of task is greatly appreciated.p
Negative 14456 pFirebase provides .read, .write and .validate in the security rules. In each of these youre allowed to access various other parts of the entire data tree.p  pI am curious if the security rules are atomic and whether the data you validate against elsewhere in the tree is guaranteed to be locked while the security rules are being applied.p  pTake for example any .write or .validate rule that is simply data.exists while this prevents updates from being made to an existing object when creating it does it make it safe from two users creating the same object at the same timep
Negative 14456 pHy I am working on java app that has 2 forms. In first form my user order meals and I store his order in my database on localhost server.

Negative 14456 pI have seen numerous posts on how to display progress bar while the data loads in the background. All suggestions requires we manually place a ProgressBar in the layout xml and then use an codeAsyncTaskcode to show and hide the ProgressBar and the View in question.p  pHowever, I would like to make a generic class which creates the ProgressBar programmatically at runtime and place it exactly over the view in question and maybe also slightly shade or blur the view while the ProgressBar is displayed. Had this been a Swing application I would have painted my progress bar on the a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavasetutorialuiswingcomponentsrootpane.html relnofollowglass panea of the view after slightly shading it with gray. In that case since the progress bar is the child of the same pseudo parent hence I could easily position that as centred.p  pIn Android UI toolkit I am not aware of any such glass panes. How do I achieve this effectp

Negative 14456 pI started doing some experimentation with unit testing so that we can include them in our domain layer. However i dont know if Im following the right path, thus im going to explain what im currently doing to see if im on the right track. Basically the architecture is like the following there is Domain Layer containing domain models and domain services ex. User class and UserService class. Then Domain layer communicates with the DAL which implements the Generic Repository pattern together with the Unit of Work. Each domain service class in its constructor accepts an IUnitOfWork interface, like the followingp  precode    public class UserService IUserService              private readonly IUnitOfWork unitOfWork          public UserServiceIUnitOfWork unitOfwork                      this.unitOfWork  unitOfwork                codepre  pIn order to creat the unit tests, i decided to go with FakeItEasy framework. So in a UserServiceTest class i did the followingp  precode  private IUserService userService     private const int userID  2013      [TestInitialize]     public void Initialize          userService  A.FakeltIUserServicegt          A.CallTo gt userService.GetUserByIduserID.Returnsnew User                              UserID  userID,                 RegistrationDate  DateTime.Now,                         [TestMethod]     public void GetUserByID              var user  userService.GetUserByIduserID         Assert.IsInstanceOfTypeuser, typeofDomain.User         Assert.AreEqualuserID, user.userID       codepre  pWhen I run the tests, they pass. Is it the correct way of implementing unit tests Before I was trying a different approach however FakeItEasy was failing with a ProxyGenerator exception. What i was doing is thisp  precode [TestInitialize]  public void Initialize   unitOfWork  A.FakeltIUnitOfWorkgt  A.CallTo gt unitOfWork.UserRepository.FindByIduserID.Returnsnew UserDto              UserID  userID,         RegistrationDate  DateTime.Now,        AutoMapper.Mapper.CreateMapltUserDto, User     [TestMethod]  public void GetUserByID        var userService  new UserServiceunitOfWork      var user  userService.GetUserByIduserID      Assert.IsInstanceOfTypeuser, typeofDomain.User      Assert.AreEqualuserID, user.userID   codepre  pAnd this was throwing the below exceptionp  precodeResult Message  Initialization method Initialize threw exception.

Negative 14456 pIm working on an app for iOS, where one iPhone has to live stream its camera recordings to another iPhone to keep things simple, both are in the same WiFi network.br The streaming should work strongwithoutstrong a physical interconnect e.g. a server used for routing the stream to clients. In fact, the strongrecording iPhone should be the serverstrong which serves the other iPhone or more other iOS devices in the network with the live stream. brbr So, what I need to do isp  ol liGet the live pictures from the camerali liProcess this data if neededli liSend frame by frame to the connected clients bTCPbli liReceive the frames on the client and display them in real timeli ol  pWhat I have and what Im stuck withp  ol lipI have already solved problem 1.

I do know how to transform it into a codeCGImagecode or a codeUIImagecode thanks to Benjamin Louliers great blogposta hrefhttpwww.benjaminloulier.compostsios4anddirectaccesstothecamera2a, but I have no idea of what specifically I need to send and if I need to encode the frames somehow.br As mentioned by jab in the above linked answer a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1960782uploadlivestreamingvideofromiphonelikeustreamorqik titleUpload live streaming video from iPhonethisa it is possible to write those samples to a file with one or more codeAVAssetWritercodes. But then again he says those 5 sec video snippets are to be uploaded to a server which makes a streamable movie file out of them and that movie can then be streamed to an iOS device by codeHTTP Live Streamingcode I suppose.pli lipAs I already indicated, my app i.e. the video capturing server device has one or multiple clients connected to it and needs to send the video frames in real time to them. brOne idea which came to my mind is to use a simple codeTCPcode connection where the server sends every single frame in a strongserialisedstrong format to the connected clients in a loop. More specifically when one buffered frame is successfully sent to the client, the server takes the most recent frame as the next one to be sent.br Now is this the right thought how it should work Or is there another protocol, which is much better suited for this kind of task brRemember I want to keep it simple simple for me, i.e., so that I dont need to study too many new programming aspects and fast. I already know some things about TCP, I wrote servers and clients with it at school in codeCcode, so Id prefer to apply the knowledge I have now to this project...pli lipLast but not least, the receiving clientbr I imagine, if Im really going to use a codeTCPcode connection, that on the clientside I receive frame after frame from the server, cast the read byte package into the used format codeCMSampleBuffercode, codeCGImagecode, codeUIImagecode and just display it on a codeCALayercode or codeUIImageViewcode, right The effect of a movie will be gotten by just constantly keeping updated that image view.pli ol  pPlease give me some ideas on how to reach this goal. It is very important, because its part of my schoolgraduation project...

Negative 14456 pI am trying to write C code that will determine the ipv6 prefix subnet in IPv4 for an ipv6 address given in slash notation. As with routers, this requires a bitwise operation on an ipv6 address with its prefix length subnet mask in ipv4.  p  pfor example given 20001234123464p  pthe code will dop  p200012341234 AND FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF and will determine that the prefix for this address is 2000123400000000p  pMy difficulty doing this comes from the fact that unlike doing bitwise AND on two integers I have to do it on a byteArray or some other data structure. My idea was to convert the ipv6 address into a byte array using IpAddress.getAddressBytes as well as convert the prefix integer from the input into a byte array and do a bitwise AND on the two arrays.  p  pIs this the right approach for solving this problem or should I look into other options such as using a 128bit integer library instead of using byte arraysp  pDoes anyone know from experience what would be the best approach to takep

Negative 14456 pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pI am looking to cache HTML response of some of my pages. Since ehCache is already being used in my application, it is obvious to look for a solution there. It just so happen that ehCache has some out of the box filter like a hrefhttpehcache.orgdocumentationrecipespagecaching relnofollowSimplePageCachingFiltera available.p  pstrongProblemstrongp  pThese filter generally use URL including the a hrefhttpehcache.orgdocumentationuserguidewebcachingkeys relnofollow query string as keysa. In my case different users will have the same url and the contents for that page will be different. I can not add the user id in the query string. So perhaps the solution for me is to cache pages based on cookie [ or use some other unique user id] as part of the key. p  pstrongQuestionstrongp  pMy question is how to use a different key, other than the one being used by SimplePageCachingFilter. The documentation suggests to override javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest to take into account of significant QS parameter , but does not talk about how can I completely over ride the way key is formulated. p  pLack of sample code is also a problem so I would appreciate if someone can point me to some sample code with better control of keys.p  pAlso it would be nice to have control to invalidate the cache, rather than just waiting for the contents to expire by themselves, Though not essential for my application.p
Negative 14456 pWe are using Retrofit in our Android app, to communicate with an OAuth2 secured server. Everything works great, we use the RequestInterceptor to include the access token with each call. However there will be times, when the access token will expire, and the token needs to be refreshed. When the token expires, the next call will return with an Unauthorized HTTP code, so thats easy to monitor. We could modify each Retrofit call the following way In the failure callback, check for the error code, if it equals Unauthorized, refresh the OAuth token, then repeat the Retrofit call. However, for this, all calls should be modified, which is not an easily maintainable, and good solution. Is there a way to do this without modifying all Retrofit callsp

Negative 14456 pI have a collection of programs that repeatedly display messages to the user for various reasons.

So the next solution that springs to mind is using a singleton pattern.p  pIm sure the neatest way is dependency injection, but that presents the problem of having to instantiate a new stateless object each time I want to display a message.p  pSo my target is to create a structure that allows a single call to a common class.  p  precodeMessage.ShowMessagehello codepre  pIs there a way to achieve this simply while maintaining testabilityp

Negative 14456 pHow to CancelRegulate event which is executing in parallel with same event in another thread.p  pFor e.g. In a textbox, every time we enter a character the event fires if text changed event is defined. But after entering first character, the event Let us call First Event takes lot of time as there will be more strings which match a single character, and does some action like changing content of a title label. And after entering a second character the new event which raised to run in parallel takes less time. So now, the second event which fired after entering second character executes fast and returns first and first event executes last and thus, first events result will be printed ultimately on the label rather than the second one.p  pIs there a better way to cancel the first event before starting the second event. One thing that comes to my mind is to register threads on a global list variable and kill all threads which are not dead before starting your execution. Will this work Any better way to handle this situation.p  pP.S. I know that search could be initiated after a space or enter to solve this particular issue. But I think you have already noticed my main point. p

Negative 14456 pI have a working frontend app build with AngularJS. It interacts with a couple of 3rd party APIs and is getting data without a problem.p  pThe next step of the app would be to store this data into a CouchDB everytime a search is made. I want to build my own db little by little and to eventually rely on it and not on the 3rd party API e.g., the app first makes a query to my database, if it doesnt find whats needed, takes it from the 3rd party API, displays it on the frontend but it also saves it on my database, so next time the same search is conducted, the results will come from my resource.p  pDo I need to use nodejs and some module express, nano, etc or can I rely only on AngularJS to write data to the DBp  pThanksp

Negative 14456 pI was writing a Java program to download attachments from POP3 email. Originally I do this with getting an input stream of a MimePart if its content type is validated. And then I can simply write the input stream into a local file through a FileOutputStream.p  pHowever, one thing I encountered is that, after I received an email with an attached file as its only content and access it, the mail of type Message only consists of a single part, which is of type textplain. And its content consists of massive randomlooking character. p  pAfter searching through the internet I found that the file is uuencoded. Then I tried to find if there is any standard library for decoding it but seems I ran out of luck. So I would like to know is there any standard usual ways to decode it and obtain the attached file Thanks a lot.p

Negative 14456 pHere is the casep  p1 User  on his personal computer at home   is trying to modify his post and for this we load his already saved content from database to browser in editable mode  Editing his own post  .

After modifying bit of it he closed his browser  with out saving the data to database  .p  p2 The same user from different computer  could be from office computer  or from different browser  he opened the same above post for editing and he sees his old content  since he didnt save his posting  . He made some changes and saved the content . p  p3 Back to home he wants to modify the same post again and opens it but this time he gets the data from his LocalStorage the one he edited in the first step .  This is totally invalid data . Since already he modified the content in the second step .p  pCould you please throw me some idea how do we delete his data modified in the first step or how do we proceed in this kind of scenarios p  pOne thought I have is in the 1st step along with the data in the LocalStorage also store time stamp of the key strokes.  When loading the data from database again check the saved timestamp in the database with the timestamp in the local store . If it is less than the server time delete the LocalStorage key for that post . But is there any other easy way to handle it p  pThank Youp

This is not to be used for anything other than educational purposes.p  pSo I have a bit of code that checks multiple conditions for a credit card string that someone types in. For example, as youll see, it checks the starting digit, the name of the card, and the number of digits. It checks the conditions, and if they are met the program continues, if not it gives an error and stops immediately. Im like 99 sure that Im entering my information in correctly, but it gives me the error no matter what and Im at a loss here.p  pSorry if I typed so much, again Im new here.

With GCC I have successfully done this using codeschedsetaffinitycode so I no longer have to set codeexport OMPPROCBINDtruecode.  I want to do the same thing in Windows with MSVC.

I can see from Windows Task Manger when I right click on the processes and click Set Affinity that every other CPU is set 0, 2, 4, 6 on my eight hyper thread system.

Negative 14456 pI am currently working on an application that requires math expressions to be rendered from latex and needs to have some sort of native gui even if it just uses gtk, then renders html in webkit.p  pI did some research and decided an easy way to do this would be to use webkit to load a web page and use a JavaScript library like MathJax to render the math. Some other reasons why I chosen to do it this way over other solutions are I have had a fair amount of experience developing web apps in python although a while ago, lack of experience with native guis and the portability it would provide.p  pFor a web app framework I have chosen to use flask as it is one I am most familiar with.p  pThe problem is this application needs to have its own native GUI through preferably gtk even if just renders html with webkit and also preferably shouldnt have a http server that is attached to some socket.p  pSo my question is, instead of running flasks server is there any way to do something like thisp  precodeimport gtk import webkit  from flask import Flask app  Flaskname  app.route def helloworld     return lth1gtHello Worldlth1gt  if name  main      window  gtk.Window      webview  webkit.WebView      webview.loadstring         app.loadfromuri,         texthtml,         utf8,                    window.addwebview      window.showall  codepre  pWhere codeapp.loadfromuricode is just used as an example of a way to load the webpage for a given uri of a Flask app. But as this is just an example, how could codeapp.loadfromuricode be done in real codep  pAlso is there anyway to override when the user clicks a link so it does something like thisp  precodedef linkclickeduri     webview.loadstring         app.loadfromuriuri,         texthtml,         utf8,         uri      codepre  pThanks any help is greatly appreciatedp

Negative 14456 pAfter days of trying variation after variation, I finally got all of the sizing parameters working, using default settings for the IFRAME to calculate default settings for everything else up to the screen size.

First, the .modalbody width is sizing 30px too small.  Ive fixed this by making var contentX  bodyX  bodyPX, but it causes problems with the resizing where for every resize it gets smaller and smaller.  Any ideas on how I can fix the width of the content without changing the body and causing this constant shrinkp  pThe second problem is in regards to the ratio and its changeover from sizing off the height to sizing off the width.  If works great, to a point.  Resizing from a rowview to a columnview, it glitches and switches to sizing by width too early, forcing the top and bottom of the modal to appear off screen.  I know the windowX  windowY ratio isnt the ideal ratio to work with, but since the size of the modal, which I believe is the ideal ratio, is set by calculations done during the IF statement, Im not entirely sure on how I can fix this.p  pAny ideas or help would be greatly appreciated, and Im sorry for the messy code.p

Negative 14456 pIm building my first Rails project and its a checkout system for a computer loaner pool.  Creating codeTechnicianscode who perform checkouts and codeCheckOutscode like transactions makes perfect sense.  However, Im struggling with the relationship between codeCheckOutscode and codeLoanerComputerscode.p  pcodeTechniciancode and codeCheckOutcode have a 1N relationship, and codeCheckOutcode and codeLoanerComputercodehave a 11 relationship.  I believe in my Railsn00b heart that it would be nice to have association proxy, e.g. codeTechnician.checkouts.loanercomputerscode or even better codeTechnician.loanercomputerscode, but from what Ive learned that would mean that my codeLoanerComputercode class must contain the codebelongstocode, and that assumes that the codeLoanerComputercode table in my database has a codecheckoutidcode column.p  pIve tried thinking about it from a rental approach, but I see lots of solutions that have a fourth model to store state changes of the thing being rented. To me, it makes more sense to have codetechnicianidcode and codeloanercomputeridcode in a single codeCheckOutcode entry, but then how could I easily access a technicians checkedout loaner computers using association proxy  Is it possible to use codedelegatecode in this instance, or does it look like Id have to make a custom method to read loaner computers via technicians  Heres example codep  precodeclass Technician lt ActiveRecordBase   hasmany checkouts end  class CheckOut lt ActiveRecordBase   belongsto technician     hasone loanercomputer      OR    belongsto loanercomputer which means I need to have a loanerid column in the db, right end  class LoanerComputer lt ActiveRecordBase    belongsto checkout which means I need to have a checkoutid column in the db      OR    hasone checkout end codepre  pP.S.

When user enters a website it will be checked against a list of nodes and if the site is already present in the list, we will remove it from the list and add it as head. If it is not in the list, it will be simply added as head of the list. But he told order of complexity is Onn and he asked me are there any other data structures or combination of data structured we could use to make the order of complexity as On. I didnt get any clue at that time. Can any one please let me know if you have any idea.p

Negative 14456 pI am facing a strange issue.p  pIn my application, I need to load a static html file based on clicked button in a WebView from assets folder.p  pNow among 5 html files, one html file contains 15 static links. These links need to redirect user to the   mentioned url in a mobile browser.

Negative 14456 pI have a collection of objects, and I wish to generate a hash value using SHA256 from this collection of objects.p  pThis process of hashing these objects is part of a Zero Knowledge proof system, where a prover generates a proof, which is later verified by a verifier. This proof is actually the output of a hash function.p  pThese objects all contain 3 or 4 large BigInteger values of the order of 2048 bits. The number of objects is variable, but it will be something between 4 and 10.p  pI have written the following method for generating the hash value from a variable number of objectsp  precodepublic byte[] buildHashFromHashcodesfinal Object... listOfObjects       for Object obj  listOfObjects           if obj  null              throw new Exception                 Input objects cannot be null                   md.updateintToBytesobj.hashCode           return md.digest   private byte[] intToBytesfinal int intValue      return new byte[] byte intValue gtgt 24,             byte intValue gtgt 16, byte intValue gtgt 8,             byte intValue   codepre  pstrongMy question is related to the use of the hashCode method in this code. Specifically I am trying to determine whether the use of the hashCode method will weaken the security of the system, as it only generates a 32 bit number, therefore the hash is only updated with 32 bits of information during each iteration. So I am not sure if this loss of information at this point in the process really weakens the system.strongp  pThe implementation of the hashCode method of these objects uses the large BigInteger values to generate their hash codes, but the number is then truncated to an int before being return.p  pPart of my concerns arises from the fact that it is relatively likely that there will be collisions between the hash codes of some objects. But then again, the hash is updated several times inside of a loop, so a single collision would not be a massive problem.p  pLets assume that there were 4 objects in the collection of objects. In the first iteration of the loop, 32 bits will be used to update the hash, in the second iteration another 32 bits will be used to update it, etc.p  pIt is my understanding that the hashing algorithm is executed after the update method is called. It is not the case the 128 bits  the 4 objects will be stored in a buffer, and then the hashing algorithm will be executed using those 128 bits as input.p  pTherefore, can we say that the total number of states that the hash will be in, after the final update would be 232  232  232  232 in practices this will not happen of course, as it will be truncated at some points.p  pI believe that the use of the hashCode is a safe approach, given the fact that the update method is called during each iteration.p  pTo avoid the risk of collisions between objects, an alternative approach would be to use the toString method of each object, which returns a String that includes the full amount of entropy of each object the value of the large BigInteger numbers is included in the String. This would mean that the hash is updated with much more information during each iteration of the loop, but I am not sure if this is necessary.p  pSo, my question is, does the use of the hashCode method in this code weaken the strength of the systemp

Negative 14456 pI have the following problem at hand I have a very long list of words, possibly names, surnames, etc. I need to cluster this word list, such that similar words, for example words with similar edit Levenshtein distance appears in the same cluster. For example algorithm and alogrithm should have high chances to appear in the same cluster.p  pI am well aware of the classical unsupervised clustering methods like kmeans clustering, EM clustering in the Pattern Recognition literature. The problem here is that these methods work on points which reside in a vector space. I have words of strings at my hand here. It seems that, the question of how to represent strings in a numerical vector space and to calculate means of string clusters is not sufficiently answered, according to my survey efforts until now. A naive approach to attack this problem would be to combine kMeans clustering with Levenshtein distance, but the question still remains How to represent means of strings. There is a weight called as TFIDF weigt, but it seems that it is mostly related to the area of text document clustering, not for the clustering of single words. It seems that there are some special string clustering algorithms existing, like the one at  a hrefhttppike.psu.educleandb06papersCameraReady120.pdf relnofollowhttppike.psu.educleandb06papersCameraReady120.pdfa p  pMy search in this area is going on still, but I wanted to get ideas from here as well.

Negative 14456 pIm migrating an application from PowerBuilder 9 to PowerBuilder 12 Classic. In the course of this, Ive noticed that PB now renders some of the controls differently for example, on one window, some of the dropdown data windows are marked to render with a box around them, while others arent  but they all render with the box. PB12 fixes this, rendering each control as actually specified.p  pSo, as long as Im going through here and making things consistent, I might as well make emeverythingem consistent, as far as possible. Well be deploying this on Windows 7 machines for the next couple of years, at least, so Aero is the theme I want to aim for, either with the PB defaults or by setting the controls to look like they should. I tried looking at the MS UX guidelines, but either I didnt find the right page, or it doesnt actually say. So, what should the controls look like Boxes Lowered NoBorderp  pThanks.p

Negative 14456 pI am creating an EXT form that uses several codePanelcode components, one of which collapses to the left.

Currently I have a hardcoded radius to 80 units this works fine when there are the number of ellipses are few hundred, however when I have a few thousand ellipses it looks all wrong as they are too small for the scale of the scene.  img srchttpi.stack.imgur.com9rHvp.png alttiny ellipses Conversely when there are only a few 10s the scene being smaller the ellipses are way to large.p  pI am looking to find a formula that better balances the size of an ellipse, with the number of ellipses on the scene and the scale of the scene.p  pAlso as I zoom in and out I would like the ellipses to remain appropriately sized. p  pCan anyone advise on how to best achieve a balanced arrangementp

The text file contains a list of the integers from 1 to 10000 in unsorted order you should treat this as a stream of numbers, arriving one by one. Letting xsubisub denote the isupthsup number of the file, the ksupthsup median msubksub is defined as the median of the numbers xsub1sub,,xsubksub. So, if k is odd, then msubksub is k12supthsup smallest number among xsub1sub,,xsubksub if k is even, then msub1sub is the k2supthsup smallest number among xsub1sub,,xsubksub.p blockquote  pIn order to get emOnem running time, this should be implemented using heaps obviously.

Negative 14456 pUsing C, Windows Server 2012 R2 x64 and .NET framework 4.5.2.p  pIm working on an older piece of software that has some bad PInvoke calls that use ints where IntPtrs are needed. The calls have been in the system for years, running without issue under .NET 3.5. Some calls began failing on Server 2012 when we migrated to framework 4.5.2. They now return pointers way out in 64bit space. No similar behavior is observed on Windows 7 for example, and framework 4.0 on Server 2012 also doesnt do this.p  pIve fixed the calls  theyre defects, of course  but it bothers me that I cant explain why a framework upgrade suddenly started generating pointers larger than 32bits, on only one operating system. The behavior is regular and reproducible, both the failing behavior on Server 2012 and OK behavior elsewhere. I have assumed this is related to address space layout randomization ASLR  but thats been active since Server 2008, and theres nothing anywhere to suggest this has been modified or enabled. Does any one know more, or should I just write this off to the way things evolve over time and not think about itp  pNote this is not a duplicate of a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions28880570overflowerrorsin64bitwindowsserver2012afterupgradetonetframeworkOverflow Errors in 64bit Windows Server 2012 after Upgrade to .NET Frameworka  I know why my errors are occurring, we had bad stuff going on. What I am curious about  is what might have changed in the underlying framework to suddenly surface the problems.p

Negative 14456 pIm a little behind the times on data access and need to be pointed in the right direction. I currently have just a single SQL Server db table with about 35 columns in it. Im building a WCF web service to provide access to it and am trying to figure out the quickest way to link up the C based web service to the database. p  pIve been looking at Entity Framework but it seems pretty heavy and everything Ive found on it so far seems to assume you already know something about it so I didnt want to get too far into it if its the wrong path. Im not fully sold on the idea of generating SQL in the application. I already have a DataContract class with properties for each column in the table, Im just looking for an automatic way to map columns to properties and properties back to columnssproc parameters. I already wrote some code that uses reflection to map data from a different source to this DataContract matching on property name with a dictionary of additional mappings as a backup so its not that much work to do the same here, but I wanted to see what else is available. What I want to avoid is writing out each codePropertyName  ColumnName.Valuecode. Is there something light weight built into VS2010 .NET 4.0 for a simple case like this Would directly calling a stored procedure through EF as is mentioned a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9930408entityframeworkstoredproceduresandpocoherea be a good option It looks a little out of date.p

Negative 14456 pguys. After lurking on too many threads, not being able to find an answer to the problem Im having, Ive decided to finally post up a question of my own. Im working on an assignment for school, and for a particular part, its asking me to write a template function that will take two parameters of different types, then swap the contents of the parameters. Given that it is an assignment for school, I dont expect anyone to just give me the answer. That does kind of defeat the purpose and working through it to learn it, after all. But any hints to get me in the right direction would be much appreciated.p  pThis is basically what Im working with right now, and Im pretty much stuck. As far as I can tell, theres no error, as I can build and run it with no problem. Im just getting wonky values in the output.

Negative 14456 pIve been trying to debug a chunk of code for some hours now, banging my head against the wall, and finally pinpointed my issues to a place in the code where assigning the results of a collection.findOne call to a variable is giving me different data than what I see with a console.log of the same findOne on the previous line. p  precodeprePostState  functionthisStID      console.logStudents.findOneidthisStID     var stTemp  Students.findOneidthisStID     console.logstTmp     var testsTemp  stTmp.tests codepre  pThe collection object has a tests array. In this instance, the array contains 3 objects as its elements. p  pWhile both the console.log lines return something like this  p  precode Object id eXf9dqQbaemKS24Ti, name Student,Name, group none, site SiteName, tests Array[3]   codepre  pExpanding each shows different data. The first one shows the correct tests Array[3], the second one shows tests Array[1], and the single element in that array also has data that is different from the matching element in the full array. p  pUpdatebr Doing some further testing, Ive changed the code a bit.  p  precodeprePostState  functionthisStID    console.logStudents.findidthisStID.fetch 1   var stTmp  Students.findidthisStID.fetch   console.logstTmp                                 2   console.logstTmp[0].tests.length                 3   forvar i  0 i lt stTmp[0].tests.length i       console.logstTmp[0].tests[i]                  4      codepre  p1 Returns p  precode[Object]   0 Object     id AqLHB8hT8GxzQ7zyD     group none     name Student,Name     site SiteName     tests Array[3] codepre  p2 Returnsp  precode[Object]   0 Object   id AqLHB8hT8GxzQ7zyD   group none   name Student,Name   site SiteName   tests Array[1] codepre  p3 Returnsp  precode3   codepre  pThe for loop at 4 repeats three times and prints out each of the three objects in the tests array. p  pObviously this means I can access the data I need. Instead of  p  precodevar testArray  stTmp.tests codepre  pWhich leaves me with an array with only a single element, I will just have to get the length of stTmp.tests, and then use a for loop to access each element by index and insert them into the testArray variable. p  pSo I can continue on, but I still dont understand the behavior Im seeing. Im on a bit of a timeline to keep making progress at this point, but when I have some time I may revisit this and try and replicate it in a meteorpad or other form that I can share the full code with. p

Negative 14456 pI am using salt for last one month.

Output looks something likep  precode minion1 true   minion2 true   minion3 true  codepre  pIn the masters codeconfcode file, return type is configured to JSON. But if I execute an incorrect command through salt master say codesudo salt  test1.pingcode, then the master returns something like this p  precode minion1 test1.ping is not available.   minion2 test1.ping is not available.   minion3 test1.ping is not available.  codepre  pIn both the outputs displayed above, the command has given a success exit code on the masters shellterminal. How do we track which minions were not able to execute the commands. I am not interested in what type of error it is, I just need some or the other way to track the minions which failed to execute the command. p  pThe last solution is to write a parser which will read the complete output and decide for itself. Hope that there is a better solution.p

If I click the back button again, another GUI will pop up behind the current GUI.p  precodefrom tkinter import  from tkinter import font from tkinter import filedialog  class App Im not typing what goes in this class, this way I can avoid issues with AppFrame, etc. DUCKTYPE def initself, master     self.frame  Framemaster     self.frame.pack     self.master  master     master.titlePyCCI Caste     self.total  2     self.fwd Need to call these at the beginning otherwise the window is minimized No idea why.     self.bck The back button creates a duplicate window...

Negative 14456 pI am codePOSTcodeing to a certain codehttpscodeendpoint using a codepythoncode script and codepycurlcode codeBASICcode authentication, connection kept open over calls and experience a strange behaviour p  ul liWhen codePOSTcodeing from a client with high bandwith network connection LAN or my uberspace I get response times that are weakly dependent on payload size e.g. 1 kB is codePOSTcodeed in 40 millis, 20 kB require some 70 millis.li liWhen connected from home cable, 25 MBits downstream, 1 MBits upstream I am experiencing not only slower response tim which I was expecting, but also a much heavier dependency namely 60 millis for 1 kB and constantly increasing to 400 millis for 20 kB. This seems independent whether I post from a cabled Raspberry Pi or a Wifi connected i5 computer, so I am concluding the issue is the upstream bandwith.li ul  pBut The respective response times recorded by the client are also recorded by the server a codetomcatcode I believe, with a delta of, say, 3 millis.p  pstrongQuestionstrong How can this be explained from the respective setupp  pI was thinking that, of course, a slow connection will take more time to deliver payload to the server. Therefore I do not have a big problem with the response times itself. I merely have an issue with my lack of understandingp  pI was thinking that the client deliveres the payload to the server over the network and then the server will start to process it once it is there. Therefore I was expecting the client to record a longer response time than the host does the difference of the readings being the time spent on the internet. The delta should be bigger when the connection is low bandwith and getting smaller with increasing bandwith. But it seems that I have some deep misunderstanding of how codePOSTcode and network connections work. I have spent the night searching for more information about the handshake of client codecurlcode in this case and webserver supposedly codetomcatcode in this case but while I found a hrefhttpcseweb.ucsd.edubsycoke.history.txt relnofollowgreat triviaa about the early days of networking, I was not able to retrieve anything allowing me a deeper understanding of that handshake. I would appreciate any hints or pointers how to dig in.p
Negative 14456 pSo i am Using AVFoundation to capture video and audio from an external device and to write to a ProRes encoded .mov file. I started with an application that only writes video buffers to a file, and this works fine, producing a ProRes encoded .mov as expected.p  pHowever when i add the Audio AssetWriterInput to the AssetWriter, the file that gets created appears to be invalid. I have checked all the return values for each step of the operation, and everything appears to be ok, its not until i call finishWriting on the assetWriter at the very end of things that i get an error.   Sadly checking this error reveals the 11800 AVErrorUnkown error, which isnt much help.p  pNow, a few things to note  I am trying to create a file with multiple tracks of uncompressed audio. Eg 48Khz, 16bit,      however for the sake of simplicity currently my sample only uses 1 track, which means only 1 AVAssetWriterIput for the audio.      I am 95 sure i have specified the dictionary settings correctly, but if your confident with that topic plz have a quick look to confirm.p  ul lipAm a bit unsure of the correct CMTime value to use when i create my audio CMSampleBuffer, with video i am adding 1 frame at a time, with a fps of 25,  my CMTime values are created as such  CMTimeMakeframeNo, 25.00  but for the Audio buffers i am using CMTimeMakeframeNo  1920, 48000  because the CMSampleBuf contains 1920 smples, at an overall rate of 48khz.  Do the CMTime values need to match across the 2 different AVAssetInputWriter instances  ie. video and audio  1920 because there are 1920 unique audio samples for a single frame of Video  ie. PAL  1080i50pli lipThe resulting mov file that is created appears to be the correct size, ie. it is slightly bigger than the same file but with Video only.pli lipIf I comment out ONLY the Audio AVAssetWriterInput appendSampleBuffer  call, the resulting file is readable, and fine,  though it shows no audio tracks, despite me adding, starting and stopping the inputWriter, but obviously not writing any actual samples.pli ul  pOK so here is the Code, just ignore the stuff about decoding hanc buffers and geting the video thats all relevant to getting the data form the device in Question.p  precodeint mainint argc, const char  argv[]   autoreleasepool      NSLogHello, World   Welcome to the ProResCapture With Audio sample app.      OSStatus status     AudioStreamBasicDescription audioFormat     CMAudioFormatDescriptionRef audioFormatDesc       OK so lets include the BVC stuff first and then we can see about doing some actual capture  and compress stuff     BLUEVELVETCHANDLE pBVC  bfcFactory     if pBVC              BLUEUINT32 inputVidMode  VIDFMTINVALID         BLUEUINT32 memFmt  MEMFMTARGB         BLUEUINT32 height  0         BLUEUINT32 width  0         BLUEUINT32 fpsRate  0         BLUEUINT32 bIs1001  false         BLUEUINT32 bIsProgressive  false         unsigned long ulUpdateType  UPDFMTFRAME         unsigned long ulFieldCount  0         unsigned int numAudioChannels  1 4         int numFramesToCapture  200          bfcAttachpBVC, 1  just use the first card for this demo  sample         bfcSetCardProperty32pBVC, DEFAULTVIDEOINPUTCHANNEL, BLUEVIDEOINPUTCHANNELA  use input channel A           check for a Valid input video signal.         bfcQueryCardProperty32pBVC, VIDEOINPUTSIGNALVIDEOMODE, inputVidMode         if inputVidMode lt VIDFMTINVALID                       Configure the card for basic RGBA capture.

I can make video only work. I can do all the setup and configuration for the audio but not add the buffers and it works. When i DO add the audio samples the appendSampleBuffer call complets without error.p  pBut when i try and finishcomplete the file i get an error from the [assetWriter finishWriting] call Of course looking into the rror is no help p  pSo what am i doing wrong anyone got any suggestions on how i can examine or diagnose the broken mov file that is createdp  pI haved used Atom Inspector to examine 3 different files,p  pA. The working file ie. video only no audio, written via my application using AVFoundation.p  pB. The broken file ie video and audio, written via my applpication using AVFoundation.p  pC. A working file created with FinalCutPro legacy and exported using the same settings i am tryint to use for my application.p  pI should also mention that i have tried to use the old dumpster toolapp to open the file but since it is looking at the moov Atom directly it fails to open my broken file at all.p  pOK so my results... File C appears to be quite different so it has not provided much help, as a comparison tool. not surprising since it was created differently BUT, When i examine the broken video file  ie file B  it ONLY has the following Atoms ftyp  File Type wide  Wide Atom Header mdat  Media Headerp  pwhereas file A, has many many more, including the moov  Movie Atom which in turn contains all the useful information.p  pSO, something about the way i am closing the file or adding the audio is causing the moov Atom to not be written properly, or at all, to the file upon close.p  pAny comments would be most appreciated,p  pThanks,      Jamesp

Negative 14456 pI have a REST API with an Basic Filter.

Negative 14456 pI tried to create a child class of codeDataGridViewButtonColumncode but I am stuck. The only property I can easily change now is codeFlatStylecode that is part of Button class. Say I would like to change codeForeColorcode there are other things as well, codeForeColorcode is just an example so please dont stick to that, i.e. dont use workaround like codeDefaultCellStylecode. I thus would have to somehow retrieve Button object from codeDataGridViewButtonColumncode. Inside codeDataGridViewButtonColumncode there is codeDataGridViewButtonCellcode. This class I believe holds the Button and it has property named Value derived from codeDataGridViewCellcode but it is null in the codeDataGridViewButtonCellcodes constructor thus I cant access it from there.

Negative 14456 pIm using Ionic to develop a scan application to validate tickets at events. Since their are usually large cues, the focus of the app is speed. Im using a hrefhttpsgithub.comphonegapphonegappluginbarcodescanner relnofollowBarcodeScanner plugina for Cordova. Out of the box, a scan action opens the camera, scans a code, closes the camera, and then gives me the code. Since opening and closing the camera takes up time, I would like to change this plugin to keeping the camera open, and having a popup on top of the camera feed when a code is scanned.p  pI know I probably have to change the source files of the plugin, but I have no idea where to start. Maybe someone else has experience with thisp  pAny other free Cordova plugin which supports this is fine too. Or maybe use a Barcode Scanner written in JS, like a hrefhttpsserratus.github.ioquaggaJS relnofollowQuaggaJSa How would I implement this in my Ionic app Because I figure Ill need to have camera access permission.p

Is it really possible for arbitrary corruption to occur with either of these options If so, whyp  pI am not using any transactions, so partially written data from transactions is not a concern, and I can handle loosing data once in a blue moon.
