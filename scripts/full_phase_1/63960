Positive 63960 pIm using Twig to render my simple site.p  pI have header and left column list of site folders. Both header and column use dynamic data, i.e. I render it with some data.p  pIn my right column Id like to show content of folder specified by user in left column.p  pI have basic layout.php, structure.php partial for left column which extends layout.php, and content.php which extends structure.php. When no folder is specified I render structure.php, i.e. header and all site folders.p  pBut I have faced with a problem. When I try to render content.php I must set data not only for content itself, but for layout.php and structure.php. p  pIn fact I must duplicate data to render structure.php and content.php. I seems very strange to me. I feel there must be a nice solution, but I dont where it is.p  pHope, someone could help me with it. Thank you.p

Positive 63960 pIm implementing my first Twig project.  I have a MySQL database. It includes a table where each record is a document. There are Title, Number, and Description fields.p  pWithout Twig, it was pretty straightforward to query all the results and output them to a table.  However, Im having some difficulty getting the query to Twig.  It seems like a basic task, but I havent found any similar examples in the Twig documentation or by searching around.p  pTwig templates look a lot like DjangoJinja templates, which Im more familiar with.  My templatep  precode block Content   lttable border1 width100gt      for i in queryResult      lttrgt         lttdgt i.Title lttdgt     lttrgt      endfor  lttablegt  endblock  codepre  pThe PHP for this view looks like thisp  precodeconnectionmysqlconnect credentials or die Cannot connect to database . mysqlerror     mydbmysqlselectdbdatabase  sql  query  query  mysqlquerysql  result  mysqlfetchassocquery  echo twig gt renderallreports.html, arrayqueryResultgt result codepre  pWhich seems right. The script should execute a SQL query, return the resultset as an array, and then send the result to the template.  The template should iterate over all the items in the array one item for each row and display them in a table.p  pWhat actually happens is that a three rows are rendered, all blank.  My interpretation is that the template sees three items in the array one for each field instead of an item for each record in the query result.  They are blank because each field doesnt have a Title field.  But Im at a loss as to what would fix this.p
Positive 63960 pI am working on a test project to learn symfony2twig.

Negative 63960 pI need to manage CPUheavy multitaskable jobs in an interactive application. Just as background, my specific application is an engineering design interface. As a user tweaks different parameters and options to a model,  multiple simulations are run in the background and results displayed as they complete, likely even as the user is still editing values. Since the multiple simulations take variable time some are milliseconds, some take 5 seconds, some take 10 minutes, its basically a matter of getting feedback displayed as fast as possible, but often aborting jobs that started previously but are now no longer needed because of the users changes have already invalidated them. Different user changes may invalidate different computations so at any time I may have 10 different simulations running. Somesimulations have multiple parts which have dependencies simulations A and B can be seperately computed, but I need their results to seed simulation C so I need to wait for both A and B to finish first before starting C.p  pI feel pretty confident that the codelevel method to handle this kind of application is some kind of multithreaded job queue. This would include features of submitting jobs for execution, setting task priorities, waiting for jobs to finish, specifying dependencies do this job, but only after job X and job Y have finished, canceling subsets of jobs that fit some criteria, querying what jobs remain, setting worker thread counts and priorities, and so on. And multiplatform support is very useful too. p  pThese are not new ideas or desires in software, but Im at the early design phase of my application where I need to make a choice about what library to use for managing such tasks. Ive written my own crude thread managers in the past in C I think its a rite of passage but I want to use modern tools to base my work on, not my own previous hacks.p  pThe first thought is to run to a hrefhttpopenmp.orgwpOpenMPa but Im not sure its what I want. OpenMP is great for parallelizing at a fine level, automatically unrolling loops and such. While multiplatform, it also invades your code with pragmas. But mostly its not designed for managing large tasks.. especially cancelling pending jobs or specifying dependencies. Possible, yes, but its not elegant.p  pI noticed that a hrefhttpwww.switchonthecode.comtutorialshowgooglechromestorespasswordsGoogle Chrome uses such a job manager for even the most trivial tasks.a The design goal seems to be to keep the user interaction thread as light and nimble as possible, so anything that can get spawned off asynchronously, should be. From looking at the Chrome source this doesnt seem to be a generic library, but it still is interesting to see how the design uses asynchronous launches to keep interaction fast. This is getting to be similar to what Im doing.p  pThere are a still other  optionsp  pa hrefhttpmembers.gamedev.netRivorussurgehtmlindex.htmlSurge.Acta a Boostlike library for defining jobs. It builds on OpenMP, but does allow chaining of dependencies which is nice. It doesnt seem to feel like its got a manager that can be queried, jobs cancelled, etc. Its a stale project so its scary to depend on it.p  pa hrefhttpwww.codeproject.comKBthreadsmultithreadedjobqueue.aspxJob Queuea is quite close to what Im thinking of, but its a 5 year old article, not a supported library.p  pa hrefhttpwww.boost.orgdoclibs1380dochtmlthread.htmlBoost.threadsa does have nice platform independent synchronization but thats not a job manager. a hrefhttppocoproject.orgPOCOa has very clean designs for task launching, but again not a full manager for chaining tasks. Maybe Im underestimating POCO though. p  pSo while there are options available, Im not satisfied and I feel the urge to roll my own library again. But Id rather use something thats already in existence. Even after searching here on SO and on the net I havent found anything that feels right, though I imagine this must be a kind of tool that is often needed, so surely theres some community library or at least common design. On SO theres been some a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions38501threadpoolforexecutingarbitrarytaskswithdifferentprioritiespostsa about a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions125812managingthreadpoolstarvationwithinamultithreadedworkqueueprocessorjob queuesa, but nothing that seems to fit. p  pMy post here is to ask you all what existing tools Ive missed, andor how youve rolled your own such multithreaded job queue.p
Negative 63960 pI am trying to write the HTML and CSS for an internal webapp properly. As much as technically possible, I want the HTML markup to define the emcontentem of the page and be completely independent of what the layout will need to be.p  pObviously it is not possible to do this perfectly. I die a little inside every time I have to add an extra nested div for the sole purpose of making the layout work.p  pThe most recent problem I have been trying to tackle is how to reduce the amount of duplicated text in my .css file. The main thing is colors. All throughout my app I use colors to represent clean, errors, warnings, and pardoned and so far pretty much every place that uses the colors needs to have them explicitly defined. Sometimes they are used for text colors, sometimes background colors, sometimes border colors.p  pstrongIs there a way to assign a value such as a color to a name, and then reference that name in the CSS propertiesstrongp  pI am aware of how inheritance works in CSS and I am aware that one method of accomplishing this goal would be to use multiple class names on a lot of my elements and then I could just have codebackgroundCleancode be a style that all sorts of objects use. But that requires making the HTML aware of more data that is only relevant to the stylistic layout of the page and not the data, which as I mentioned I would emlikeem to avoid.p  pBonus Question strongWhat is the best practice for doing this kind of stuffstrong Am I stupid in trying to make HTMLCSS act like an MVC when it is not ready to do so I know that is the direction CSS has always been headed but perhaps its just not there yet.p

Negative 63960 pGiven a model with ForeignKeyField FKF or ManyToManyField MTMF fields with a foreignkey to self how can I prevent emselfem recursive selection within the Django Admin admin. p  pIn short, it should be possible to empreventem self recursive selection of a model instance in the admin. This applies when editing existing instances of a model, not creating new instances.p  pFor example, take the following model for an article in a news appp  precodeclass Articlemodels.Model                title  models.CharFieldmaxlength100     slug  models.SlugField     relatedarticles  models.ManyToManyFieldself codepre  pIf there are 3 codeArticlecode instances title a13, when editing an existing codeArticlecode instance via the admin the coderelatedarticlescode field is represented by default by a html multipleselect box which provides a list of ALL articles codeArticle.objects.allcode. The user should only see and be able to select codeArticlecode instances other than itself, e.g. When editing codeArticlecode a1, coderelatedarticlescode available to select  a2, a3. p  pI can currently see 3 potential to ways to do this, in order of decreasing preferencep  ol liProvide a way to set the queryset providing available choices in the admin form field for the coderelatedarticlescode via an exclude query filter, e.g. codeArticle.objects.filterQidiexactself.idcode to exclude the current instance being edited from the list of relatedarticles a user can see and select from. Creationsetting of the queryset to use could occur within the constructor codeinitcode of a custom codeArticle ModelFormcode, or, via some kind of dynamic codelimitchoicesto Modelcode option. This would require a way to grab the instance being edited to use for filtering.li liOverride the codesavemodelcode function of the codeArticle Modelcode or codeModelAdmincode class to check for and remove itself from the coderelatedarticlescode before saving the instance. This still means that admin users can see and select all articles including the instance being edited for existing articles.li liFilter out self references when required for use outside the admin, e.g. templates.li ol  pThe ideal solution 1 is currently possible to do via custom model forms outside of the admin as its possible to pass in a filtered queryset variable for the instance being edited to the model form constructor. Question is, can you get at the codeArticlecode instance, i.e. self being edited the admin before the form is created to do the same thing.p  pIt could be I am going about this the wrong way, but if your allowed to define a FKF  MTMF to the same model then there should be a way to have the admin  emdo the right thingem  and prevent a user from selecting itself by excluding it in the list of available choices.p  pstrongNotestrong Solution 2 and 3 are possible to do now and are provided to try and avoid getting these as answers, ideally id like to get an answer to solution 1.p

So I would like to create a timer that if the users location isnt determine by say time x then we simply stop trying to determine it and go with what we have.p  pAlso, is there a way I can find out whether the device has a gps chip or not  I know I can simply look at the device type in UIDevice and distingusih between touch and iphone, but how about iPhone without GPS and with GPS p  pThanksp

Another approach is to create all the fonts before drawing the multipartline, and then just switch between them  is this better Well, I can also create font objects onthefly as I draw the line, add them to some kind of fontobjectcache and then look in cache before trying to create a new one What do you think, which is the best approachp  pThe second problem is that D3DXFont seem to not understand underlinestrikethrough font styles. Although D3DFONT is based on LOGFONT, it omits those fields supports italic though. Lets say I really really need underlinestrikethrough, what do I do Is there a way to force ID3DXFont to do underline Should I just draw those lines myself how do I do that fast Or maybe I should switch to drawing with GDI on HDC and then copying those pixels into texture  will that provide reasonable performancep

For anyone who doesnt know the premise Some apps dont have a requirement or desire to use a username, they use only email for registration amp auth.

Potentially even longer than the 75 char suggested here, but 75 char accommodates most sane email addresses. The question is aimed at this situation, as encountered by emailauthbased applications.p

Negative 63960 pIm beginning to learn some HadoopMapReduce, coming mostly from a PHP background, with a little bit of Java and Python. p  pBut, it seems like most implementations of MapReduce out there are in Java, Ruby, C or Python. p  pIve looked, and it looks like there are some HadoopMapReduce in PHP, but the overwhelming body of the literature seems to be dedicated to those 4 languages.p  pIs there a good reason why PHP is a 2nd class language in cloud computing projects like those that involve HadoopMapReduce This is particularly surprising, considering that, outside of cloud computing world, PHP seems like its the most commonly supported language, to the detriment of the 3 above sans C languages. p  pIf this is arbitraryif PHP is just as good at handling these operations as, say, Python, what librariesprojects should I look intop

Negative 63960 pI need to create a system oriented around Methods where providers can register for the Methods they handle and consumers can do two things for now  either get Metadata for a method or execute it. Im considering creating a REST style architecture where methods are resources with unique URIs and an interface consisting of two methods  getMetadata and Execute.p  pIll need to have an equivalent of RequestMapping so that the provider that handles specific methods can be located by the central dispatcher. As a result the provider will return either Model or Metadata object.p  pThis looks pretty similar to Spring MVC but I dont want to expose and consume my resourcesmethods over the web and use http as this will incur unnecessary overhead. Instead I want to use it like a standard java API where java methods are called and java objects are transferred.

Negative 63960 pI have a quite simple WCF service method which returns an IQueryable, just for testing. Perhaps I got something wrong when trying to understand what IQueryable is designed for. I clearly plan to use this with the IQueryable provider of NHibernate later.

It doesnt even work for a simple string. p  pHeres my codep  precodepublic IQueryableltstringgt GetEquipmentConfigurations    var returnValue  new Listltstringgt   returnValue.Addtest   return returnValue.AsQueryable  codepre  pIt might not have much sense, its just for testing whether I really get those IQueryables over the wire using WCF.

Negative 63960 pOn Windows CE, I am currently in a situation where we implement a simplistic web server from scratch. The predominant use of this server will be in a onetoone USB RNDIS connection. The server is hosted by the managed application running on the device.p  pTherefore, we tightly integrated POST request handling with delivered web pages. Instead of processing the complete request and storing POST data that would be too large, the current page as identified by the request is informed about any POSTed multipart by receiving its headers and a stream of its contents. This solution works and shines and everybody is happy.p  pNow, heres the question One page in the web interface of the application allows for uploading a software update, which can be 11 to, say, 40 MB in size. We have various validation steps in place while handling this POST request, like a permission system based on a session cookie. We know whether the client is allowed to upload a software update as soon as all headers are processed, due to said session cookie. Is there any way we can avoid having to read in and discard all of the POST content, so that users get immediate feedbackp  pOur first idea was to just return a proper error message response after header processing and then close the connection, but the browser correctly, it seems complained bitterly about a prematurely reset by the peer.p

Negative 63960 pIm intending to use AMQP to allow a distributed collection of machines to report to a central location asynchronously.  The idea is to drop messages into the queue and allow the central logging entity to process the queue in a decoupled fashion the process is simply to create or update a row in a database table.p  pA problem that Im anticipating is the effect of network jitter in the message queuing process  what happens if an update accidentally gets in front of an insert because the time between the two messages being issued is less than the network jitterp  pReading the AMQP spec, it seems that I could just apply a higher priority to inserts so they skip the queue and get processed first.  But presumably this only applies if a queue actually exists at the broker to be skipped.  Is there a way to impose a buffer or delay at the broker to absorb this jitter and allow priority to be enacted before the messages are passed on to the consumersp  pOr do I have to go down the route of a resequencer as ActiveMQ suggests [1]p  pThanks, Matt.p  p[1] a hrefhttpactivemq.apache.orghowcanisupportpriorityqueues.html relnofollowhttpactivemq.apache.orghowcanisupportpriorityqueues.htmlap

But since the number of properties are huge, the memory footprint is very huge. Also maintaining so many properties is very tough.br  I tried adding a Dictionary to every ViewModel to store what values have got changed. But here the problem I faced was giving unique keys to all the controls in my application, which is not very helpfulbr  I had even thought and tried about subclassing controls like TextBox, ComboBox and overriding some methods to suit my requirement, but sadly I failed miserabley when I started adding validations and all.brbrp  pSo here I am stuck with designing a generic WPF property systemalgorithm to handle all undo redo functionality, changing styles of controls,etcp  pIt will be really great if you experts can guide me in right direction and also help me in developing such an algorithmsystem. A sample illustration will be nice thoughp
Negative 63960 pI am having a problem, but I cannot figure out what Im doing wrong. Im not sure if its a problem with my loop, or the cin buffer is not being cleaned. I am doing a program that transforms a Cstyle string to uppercase, however if the user enters more than 11 characters, then the function should only display the first 11, and anything after that should not be displayed.the problem is that if I enter more than 11 characters, then my loop never stops and keeps telling the user that the answer entered is invalid and if he would like to enter a new string.p

Negative 63960 pI am planning to develop a system with tens of thousands of objects in it, which will each have up to 42but more likely down around 4 or 5 separate actions they will potentially be performing at regular intervals.  I also plan to write code that will deactivate the timers until the object comes into use.  When idle, the objects will only need 1 timer each, but when active, the other timers will all start at once.  At first the number of objects will be small, maybe a few hundred, but I expect it to grow exponentially, and within a few months, start to reach up in the tens of thousands.p  pSo, I am very worried about efficiency of the code I will be writing for the timers and for these objects.  There are three levels in which I could write this application on that would all successfully perform the tasks required.  Also, I plan to run this system on a Quad Core server, so I would like to make use of multithreading wherever possible.p  pTo this end, Ive decided to use the System.Timers.Timer class which fires a new thread for each elapse event.p  pThese are the 3 levels I am consideringp  ol lipOne single timer operates the entire application, it iterates through each object, checks to see if any other actions need to be fired, and if so, runs them, then moves on to the next.pli lipMultitier timer where each object has a master timer that checks all of the functions the object could need to perform, runs any that are ready, and then sets the next timer interval to the next required action time.pli lipRecursivetier timer where each action in each object has its own timer that will be triggered, and then set to run the next time it will be available.pli ol  pThe problem with option 1 is that with so many objects and actions, one singular timer elapse in this manner could run for maybe 20 seconds while it executed a few million lines of looped code, where this should probably be ticking every 1 second.  If the objects arent kept in synch, the system would likely not work well.p  pThe problem with option 2 is that it would be a little harder to write than option 3, but not by much, it would also mean perhaps 10,000 maybe timers running on the system one for each object, creating and destroying threads with each elapse like its nobodys business which Im not sure if this is a problem or not.  Each timer would have to fire at least once per second in this situation, with perhaps a few hundred lines of code running up to perhaps a thousand in an extreme case.p  pThe problem with option 3 is the sheer amount of timers that could potentially be introduced into the system.  Im talking about an average of 10,000 timers with the potential for near 100,000 timers to be run at the same time.  Each elapse event may only have to run 50 or less lines of code though, making them very short.  The elapse events would have delays between a hundredth of a second on one extreme, and five minutes on the other, with the average likely being around 1 second.p  pI am proficient in Visual Basic .NET, and was planning to write it in that, but I could also revert to my highschool days and try to write this in C for efficiency if it would make that much of a difference please let me know if you have any sources on code efficiency between languages.  Also toying with the notion of running this on a clustered Linux server instead of my Quad Core Windows server, but Im not sure if I could get any of my .NET apps to run on a linux cluster like that would love any info on that as well.p  pThe main question to answer for this topic isp  pstrongDo I use option 1, 2, or 3, and whystrongp  pEdit after considering commentsp  pSo the 4th option involving the timer wheel with a spinlock.

Negative 63960 pIm currently working on a solution that has two projects, a console and a form application.  The console application is the main entry point to my application, and from the console the user would run the form application.p  pThe problem is, when the user boots the form application the rest of the business logic from the console app wont run until the form is closed.

Negative 63960 pAt my company we are developing a large system, comprised of several servers. The system is comprised from about 5 logical components. Data is stored in XMLs, MS SQL, and SQLite. Its a .Net systemmostly ,the components communicate using WCF, and some custom UDP. Clients access the system mostly through the custom UDP or WEBASP.NET amp Silverlight. p  pProtecting the communication is easy, some SSL, and some security on the WCF and were done.p  pThe main problem we are facing is that the system needs to be deployed on a clients site, a client that we dont necessarily trust. We need to defend the data on the servers, and the software itself from reverse engineering. Both are crucially important to us.p  pAlso we need a kill switch, i would like something that destroys the data and the software, upon command, or if unable to call home for a certain period of time.p  pThe direction that i was thinking of is using TPM, or something alike  some hardware encryption solution, in combination with another service that we could keep internally to encrypt all the software and data on the servers, so that the keys will come from our server safely in our site, and maybe  memory curtaining from the TPM.p  pHow do you suggest solving such a problemp  hr  pstrongUPDATEstrong 0402 Im looking for practical suggestions, or advise on products that could help me, so Im starting a bounty...p  pLook guys were basically putting our machine in the clients site for business and practicality reasons, we own that machine, and the client receives everything hes paying for within hours, and he can do with the data whatever he wants. But i the algorithms running on that machine, and some of the data stored there is our trade secrets, that we want to protect. Ideally i would want the machine not to work at all not even boot if i dont say its OK, and without my OK for everything on the machine to remain encrypted. Memory curtaining also looks like a nice way to protect the machine while executing. p  pAlso ideally I would want the HDs and the storage on all the machines to explode as soon as someone gets near them with a screwdriver...   but i think that would be taking it too far ...p  hr  pstrongUPDATEstrong 1002 O.K. after doing some research, I think we are going to try something in the same direction as the PS3 encryption system, except were going to bring in the keys for decrypting the software and the data from our servers. doing so we can decide on our machines whether we  trust the server requesting the keys, we can get a kill switch just by reseating the machine. this is probably be based on TPM or something similar, maybe intels TXT... Im also really interested in memory curtaining as an important security feature...p  pBTW, we cant solve this by moving the valuable parts of our system to our site, both because of business requirements and because its not technologically feasible  we would need a huge bandwidth.... p
Negative 63960 pLets say we have CQRSinspired architecture, with components such as Commands, Domain Model, Domain Events, Read Model DTOs.br Of course, we can use Value Objects in our Domain Model. My question is, should they also be used inp  ol liCommandsli liEventsli liDTOsli ol  pI havent seen any examples where Value Objects VO are used in the components mentioned above. Instead, primitive types are used. Maybe its just the simplistic examples. After all, my understanding of VOs use in DDD is that they act as a glue for the whole application.  p  pMy motivation  p  pCommands.br Lets say user submits a form which contains address fields. We have Address Value Object to represent this concept. When constructing command in the client, we should validate user input anyway, and when it is wellformed, we can create Address object right there and initialize Command with it. I see no need to delegate creation of Address object to command handler.  p  pDomain Events.br Domain Model already operates in terms of Value Objects, so by publishing events with VOs instead of converting them to primitive types, we can avoid some mapping code. Im pretty sure its alright to use VOs in this case. p  pDTOs.br If our queryside DTOs can contain Value Objects, this allows for some more flexibility. E.g., if we have Money object, we can choose whether to display it in EUR or USD, no need to change Read Model.  p

Presumably, I can do this and still remove them before the installation completes.p  pMy question  Is the best option to write the moral equivalent of a batch file that does an update and sign of the manifests, or is there a preexisting custom action or similar function that Ive just not noticed.p  pTell me if more info is needed.p  hr  pstrongMore Infostrong  The point of contention is a setting within the .config file that tells it where the webservice that provides its information is.  This will change for each customer, being on their intranet, and we cant  dont want to create an install customized for each customer.  Were taking advantage of the ClickOnces deployment capabilities so that once the addin is on the users system, it has the info it needs, which would be set up once by an administrator.p

Negative 63960 pI am using OpenAL for a music app for iPad. It has worked fine before, but now, after updating my device to iOS 4.3, there are poppingcrackling noises on playback. They become apparent when multiple samples are played i.e. chords, and happen at the beginning of a new sample, after the 1st or 2nd sample has already been played. Besides these artifacts, the rest of the audio output is normal.p  pI buffer audio data for each instrument, create a source for each sound to be played, and attach the source to a cached buffer. The buffer is attached to a sample of audio data by using alBufferDataStaticProcp  pI have also changed ALFREQUENCY of the AL context to match the sampling frequency of the files 16 khz, but that only fixes the issue when the sample source to be played has an ALPITCH value of 1. So whats certain is that if you change ALPITCH, you change the output frequency of the source, which will not match the output frequency of the AL context, causing the problemp  pSome of the code is borrowed from Finch, which does a lot of data initialization.

Negative 63960 pIve been developing a new rails project for a few weeks, and while I am amazed at the awesome plugins and some of the really great features in the frameworks... I am a little disappointed too. And I am worried.p  pI think I made a mistake.p  pShould I press on, or go back to what I was familiar with JavaSpringp  ol lipIt seems that unless you are looking for simple examples, googling for the exceptions to the rule, special cases and so on really hampers productivity and is increasingly becoming the norm for me.pli lipDocumentation and examples from the main site, blogs, screencasts, etc. are mostly out of date. For every 510 examples that are out there, 1 of them is actually correct.pli lipDoing anything new that should just work almost never does. I try and following documentation and examples, but my results seem to vary and I discover problems never mentioned in the documentation and examples. This seems to happen all the time actually.pli lipMy experience with trying out CoffeeScript and its integration with Rails was a disaster. Not being able to see what the problem is whenever a compiler error occurs is beyond frustrating.pli lipActiveRelation is really awesome, until you need to make a query that joins 7 tables. Then it starts to break down. I think its possible that you can get that 7table join query done in Hibernate quicker and finished reliably the first time you are learning it.pli lipTesting is actually really hard in Rails. Theres just too much Magic going on. Since Ruby is dynamic, I have no idea what I need to call to test something appropriately. There always seems to be exceptions to the rule. p  pFor example, Devise works like you would expect... until you want to test Devise in helpers. It just wont work, so you have to invent the Devisegenerated methods in your tests to make the tests pass. You dont need to do this for controllers.p  pThere are some blogs that teach how to test using Rails, but they are extremely trivial and not very helpful. Some of them are just bad actually. I found how to effective test validations in a far superior manner than many of the blogs I found for example. I just find that I am often on my own when it comes to testing.pli lipWhy does images and stylesheets not work properly when you switch to production for This is insane. Tons of people ask this if you google it... yet the framework doesnt just work.p  pI am scared to death to deploy this application eventually. The production version doesnt seem to work anything like the development version would. Scary.pli lipFor some reason, after adding jqueryrails and devise, the authentication token wasnt getting passed during ajax requests. I had to add the 4 lines of javascript code to make it work. This took me 5 hours. In Java, because you have proper sessions, you never even need to think about this type of stuff.pli lipTests run really slow. I have about 780 tests, and it already takes much longer than a Java project which has 1800 tests.pli lipTesting the application in the browser is really slow. It takes like 14 of a second to render some of the pages... and there isnt even that much ORM action going on Even for pages with 1 database query, it takes 100200 milliseconds. This is crazy.pli lipDocumentation is often out of date. For example, trying to override things in Devise was a pain because the documentation actually told me to do the wrong thing. Only after hours of googling and waiting 48 hours on another forum was I able to have someone tell me what I needed to do. All I wanted to do was have the login form reject a user where User.enabled was false. Thats it. It turns out, I was overriding active instead of activeforauthentication  which was an error in the RDocs.pli lipThe ORM behaves in really strange ways that are not intuitive at all. Insertsupdates work differently when you are associating new objects. It also doesnt cascade like Hibernate would... which makes me suspect that its not tracking dirty objects If it is... then why isnt cascading set by default Things like this are hardly good defaults. Isnt Rails supposed to be great at good defaultspli ol  pAfter 2 weeks, the number of gotchas hasnt really slowed down. I am really worried and scared. I know Java isnt immune to gotchas and problems, but I generally ran into problems about 23 times a month  not 30 in one week.p  pI am almost thinking the lack of agility when using JavaSpring is not much of a burden now when you consider how stable, fast and predictable the platform is. You maybe write a bit more code, but you know exactly whats going on... you never really deal with silent failures... and things do tend to work a lot more reliably. p  pI am starting to question using Rails for this new project.p

Negative 63960 pI like some features of NodeJS, particularly JQuerification, websocket compatibility via socket.io, view and css engines that I cannot use with JSP and of course, asynchronous calls. At least, as far as I know. So I plan on creating my application where the backend will be Java, the front end will be generated by NodeJS. The front end forms will send data to NodeJS which will pass it on to the Java backend via socket connections between NodeJS and the Java backend. So NodeJS basically acts like a middleware between the front end and the Java backend.p  pThis will be a pretty large application, and my plan looks exciting, but will I hate my future self for going down this routep  pThe advantage I have with this is that I can have a lot of realtime charts and dashboards, and enhance interactions with forms.p

Negative 63960 pI have this function that is supposed to query the database every 4 seconds for any new content that may have been posted. I then take the return and refresh a feed with dynamic html made from whatever came back from the server. This all works great.p  pMy problem is that as part of the html there is a options tray that they can press that will slide over part of the content and give them different options to do with that content, delete, copy, comment stuff like that. Well when they pop out the tray I want to clear the interval timer so that it does not refresh the html on in the feed making the tray go away. p  pThe other problem is that the user can have multiple trays open at the same time so I came up with this function to handle it allp  precode        function setTimersstatus                    var timerGetContent  null           ifstatus  login                        traycount  0             timerGetContent  null             timerGetContent  setIntervalgetContent,4000             alertinside login                       else ifstatus  negitive                          traycount              iftraycount  0 ampamp timerGetContent  null                           timerGetContent  setIntervalgetRecentContent,4000             alertinside negitive                                        else ifstatus  positive                          traycount             clearIntervaltimerGetContent             timerGetContent  null             alertinside positive                          codepre  pSo when the user presses the button to pop out the tray it calls setTimer and passes it positive before it does anything else, and then when they press the button to close the tray it calls setTimer and passes it negitive. I know the calls work and that its being passed the right parameters, I even know that its going into the right part of the function depending on what is pressed but there are times when the interval is just not cleared and it keeps firing no matter what I do.

Negative 63960 pThe deal is i want a NSDate representation of the date 18th of June 1978. I have tried to init NSDate likep  precodedateFormatter  [[NSDateFormatter alloc] init] [dateFormatter setDateStyleNSDateFormatterMediumStyle] self.dateFormatter.timeStyle  NSDateFormatterNoStyle self.startDate  [dateFormatter dateFromString190678] NSLog, self.startDate codepre  pThis produces the right date when the iPhone is set to Danish in the International settings. It does not work with a iPhone set to i.e. englishamerican settings.p  pNotice the extra day 19 because denmark is in GMT 1 and i think the NSDate defaults to time 230000. That indicates that something i not working as intended.p  pI want the above date 18061978 represented a an NSDate object regardless of the timezone, locale and International settings on the device.p  pHow to achieve thatp  pstrongEditstrongp  pSo Ole Begemanns answer seemed to resolve my issue. His solution did create the correct date both on a device in USA International settings and en European international settings. But when Apple should review the app the date created was 17th of June 1978. This makes sence since Im setting timezone to GMT 0000. And Cupertino is like GMT 0007 or so. So this would give a day earlier.p  pSo to correct my question I want the 18061978 no matter what locale, timezone the device is physically or settings wise in.p  pWhat Im trying to do is setting a start date 18. june 1978 and later in my app render the date as a string formatted like 780618 yyMMdd regardless of the timezone or place of the device. It allways has to be 780618 as this is a key start date for my app.p  pSo I might be attending the problem wrong. Instead of trying to force same date everywhere I maybe should accept the timezone stuff and try to configure the NSDateFormatter to output the right date.p  pSo basically What i want is THE NSDate instance that formats to 780618 everywhere  in any timezone with any international device settings.p  pAny ideas on how to achieve thisp

Negative 63960 pI have only just started experimenting with OpenCV a little bit. I have a setup of an LCD with a static position, and Id like to extract what is being displayed on the screen from the image. Ive seen the chessboard pattern used for calibrating a camera, but it seems like that is used to undistort the image, which isnt totally what I want to do.p  pI was thinking Id display the chessboard on the LCD and then figure out the transformations needed to convert the image of the LCD into the ideal view of the chessboard directly overhead and cropped. Then I would store the transformations, change what the LCD is displaying, take a picture, perform the same transformations, and get the ideal view of what was now being displayed.p  pIm wondering if that sounds like a good idea Is there a simpler way to achieve what Im trying to do And any tips on the functions I should be using to figure out the transformations, perform them, store them maybe just keep the transform matrices in memory or write them to file, etcp

Negative 63960 pIm trying to better understand exception handling and logging in a j2ee environment to refactor some legacy code we use log4j for our logging mechanism. Most of our current code does something like the code below on the business tier, however, Id like to switch over to unchecked exceptions and just ignore them unless it makes sense to handle them somewherep  precodetry  doSomething  catch MyException e  log.errorException, e     throw e  codepre  pAfter the exception is thrown in the business tier, it is then propagated up to the presentation tier, which again catches the exception and usually wraps it in a PortletException or ServletException and throws it again. Then, it is handled by a Spring handler which shows a friendly message to the user.  Id ultimately like to only handle exceptions for which we want to show a specific error message, and just ignore everything else.p  pQuestionsp  pIs it necessary to log exceptions in the business tier  If not, do I need to log exceptions at all especially unchecked ones  What happens to uncaught exceptions that are not logged using log4j If theyre still printed in the console, whats the purpose of log4jp  pI am confused as to how the process works...p  pThanks.p  pEDIT If an exception occurs in an outside library Spring, Hibernate, etc, is it assumed that these exceptions will be printed out using whatever logging mechanism is being used  In that case, I guess that I would only need to log the exceptions that my code throws... or am I way off base herep

Negative 63960 pI have a number of methods that ultimately call my codethis.context.SubmitChangescode method.

Negative 63960 pI am using the jQuery UISlider.  I have it set up so that upon the execution of the event slidestop ie when the user stops sliding, some code will determine if it is higher or lower than a given value in the range of the slider.  The code then determines which of a given set of values the slider is closest to, and then attempts to move the slider handle to that point.  All that is essentially working fine.  heres my dilemap  pThe handle does not animate to the new location, rather is jumps there.  I am using this line of code to move the handlep  precodenavScroller.slidervalue, newScrollerValue codepre  pwhere strongnewScrollerValuestrong is the value the logic decided the handle needed to be sent to.p  pIf I use the same line of code in a click event binded to an element on the page, but giving it a test value for strongnewScrollerValuestrong, the handle animates to the new location as it should.

Negative 63960 pIve set and confirmed in the database nodes under the content type codeminiappscode to have the alias codecontentminiapps9999testcode where code9999code is a nodes actual codeidcode, and codetestcode is the nodes codetitlecode. Everything works fine when a new node is added  i.e. I get redirected to the proper page. However, when I edit that page and press Submit, I get the page not found error. If I manually enter the above path in the browser I go to the proper page. This happens even though every conceivable permission has been set, and in fact happens on my the super admin content. Any guidance or suggestions on why the wrong redirect appears to be assigned by the form submit button handler. Thank you very much.p

Negative 63960 pIm using Access 2010 to create several reports and i cant figure out how to hide a group heading if its empty.p  pImagine I have a table such as n.b. i know nothing about cars, its just an examplep  pre H1   H2        H3      H4        DATA1    DATA2    DATA3 car  chassis   engine  pistons   dataa1  dataa2  dataa3 car  chassis   engine  pistons   datab1  datab2  datab3 car  chassis   engine  pistons   datac1  datac2  datac3 car  chassis   engine  cylinder  dataa1  dataa2  dataa3 car  chassis   engine  cylinder  datab1  datab2  datab3 car  interior          seats     dataa1  dataa2  dataa3 car  interior          seats     datab1  datab2  datab3 pre  pI have got 3 group headers of columns H1,H2 and H3 in that order. The problem i have is, when H3 contains no text i.e.  I think access evaluates that as null i want to hide the group header for H3 or at least make it so it takes no space on the report. Currently wherever H3 is blank, the report still contains a blank row.p  pIve tried this and similar in GroupHeader3s Paint and or Print eventsp  precodeIf IsNull[H3] Then     Me.GroupHeader3.Height  0     Me.GroupHeader3.BackColor  vbRed     Me.GroupHeader3.Visible  False Else     Me.GroupHeader3.Height  5     Me.GroupHeader3.BackColor  vbGreen End If codepre  pThe idea seems to work, that is if i comment out the VisibleFalse line i get a red or a green background in the right places, however it completely ignores the height option. If i put the VisibleFalse on it complains that it cant be put in the on Paint event.p  pIve also tried putting similar code in GroupHeader2s paint event but to no avail. The closest Ive got it just sits there and flickers.p  pIm kinda new to vba so i might be missing something obvious, but at the moment Im not really sure how to proceed so any help would be much appreciated.p  pEDIT For clarityp  pThe report is laid out a bit like sop  pre H1     H2           H3                H4                     DATA1       DATA2       DATA3 pre  pSo with the example data above it would appear asp  pre car     chassis               engine                       pistons                               dataa1    dataa2    dataa3                               datab1    datab2    datab3                               datac1    datac2    datac3                       cylinder                               dataa1    dataa2    dataa3                               datab1    datab2    datab3     interior                        seats                               dataa1    dataa2    dataa3                               datab1    datab2    datab3 pre  pIts the blank line group header 3 between interior and seats that i want to avoid.

Negative 63960 pI am using the Spring codeDefaultMessageListenerContainercode to gain some dynamic benefits in setting the MessageSelector value since I am using the Glassfish OpenMQ which is not that advanced in that regards. Lets have a JMS message. The listener issues a specific failure that means retry after codexcode seconds. It tries again with failure retry after codexycode seconds, and so on the time grows exponentially. If you cannot handle it after codezcode retries, consider it as a poison JMS message.p  precodeDefaultMessageListenerContainer dmlc dmlc.stop dmlc.setMessageSelectorString.formatretries lt d AND retryTime lt d, z, System.currentTimeMillis dmlc.start codepre  pI am not that satisfied with this solution, especially, when the Spring docs raise warning here. However, for the moment things meet our needs.p  pNow, I have a number of EJBs message consumers on different applications. Some of them need such dynamic changes of the messageSelector. Unfortunately, and tomybestknowledge, EJB MDBs do not support such dynamic features. For example, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions706525messagedrivenbeanselectorsjmssee thisa.p  pIs that correct is there a workaround for an EJB solution I would appreciate any help.p
Negative 63960 pI still dont have a confirmed way to reproduce this but in case this is some well known issue, Ill ask it anyway. What happens is that git often creates conflicts like thisp  precodeltltltltltltlt HEAD     actiondoadd      actiondoadd ...lots of code here... gtgtgtgtgtgtgt somebranch codepre  pSo instead of noticing that I simply added a new piece of code, git thinks that I modified the whole line instead. This sometimes happens in the middle of the file but most often  in the end of the file. My guess is that it might have something to do with endofline characters but I yet have to run tests to confirm that. Has anyone had the same issue and if yes, how do you fix itp

Negative 63960 pI am attempting to get migrations working with my project using fluent migrator. But due to the lack of documentation I am struggling to figure out how to rollback and have the codeDowncode method called for my migration class.p  pI set up the db with an initial version 1 classp  precode    [Migration1]     public class Baseline  Migration              public override void Up                      Execute.Script1Baselinebaseline.sql                   public override void Down        codepre  pI am running migrations via a batch file containing the followingp  blockquote   p....toolsfluentmigratormigrate.exe connection Data   Source.sqlexpressInitial CatalogekmDomainsIntegrated   Securitytruemultipleactiveresultsetstrue db SqlServer2005   target binReleaseEkmDomains.Migrations.dllp blockquote  pThis works fine. So I then wrote a second migration class just to test it outp  precode    [Migration2]     public class AddNewTable  Migration              public override void Up                      Create.TableNewTable.WithColumnname.AsString                   public override void Down                      Delete.TableNewTable               codepre  pAgain after running the batch file, everything works ok. I then looked at the command line options for the fluent migrator tool, and saw a codeversioncode option. I assumed that to rollback to a previous version I would simply supply codeversion 1code and the codeDowncode of codeAddNewTablecode would be called. That, however, did not happent. The console simply displays a committing transaction method then closes. But the table has not been deleted and the version number hasnt changed.p  pAm I doing this the wrong way or can anyone see some fundamental flaw in how I am doing thisp

Negative 63960 pI am using a local repository which doesnt work at all like the local repository seemed to work in the Xcode demo I watched on Lynda.com. The only way I can get it to work is to create another copy of my project directory and then point to that as a working directory within Organizer. Ok... thats fine, though it wasnt supposed to work like that according to the demo which I followed stepbystep.p  pNow my current issue is that when I wanted to check something on my production branch while I was working on another that had some uncommitted changes, I switched branches and it emmerged all the filesem Seriously... wtf. So now my production project is completely screwed and it wont let me switch back to the other branch either until I fix the merge conflict. p  pSo my question is is this regular git behaviour, or is my repository system screwy If it is indeed regular behaviour, youd think thered be at least a warning dialogue telling you that you have uncommitted changes and that its going to merge your branches.p

Negative 63960 pOkay, on honeycomb I have some functions that determine the screen size. This is sometimes used to dynamically do some UI stuff. But the problem is that it includes the bottom bar with the android buttons, which subtracts from your available screen size.p  pThe android codeDisplaycode function may be returning the right function for instance, a 1280x800 display will return 1280x740 as the display, this is the display not including the bottom android buttons but a javascript function in a webview will only determine that actual size, so 1280x800 gets 1280x800 which is incorrect because the bottom bar is there.p  pHow can I get the size of the bottom bar without hard coding it, I can at least subtract it from incorrect screen size integers this way.p

Negative 63960 pSo I have a webapp that runs in multiple environments.

Continuing developing the app, I determined I needed to do the same query elsewhere, so I added a return of properties, and made it a function called getProperties in a .java file of utility functions.

It insists there is no results in the ResultSet, even when I pass in the exact same String key.  So now I have two servlets who each declare an instance of the utility class, and call the same function with the same input, one call succeeds and returns properties, the other fails with no results.  p  pAm I missing something with Context or DataSource Why does one call work and not the otherp

Negative 63960 pI have created an Html 5 page that provides important serverside functionality.

It is completely self contained, taking needed parameters through the URL, and is ready to be closed when the OnLoad event is ready to send.  So far so good.p  pThe following process needs to be automated no human eyes or interaction and will be run from within a web service not run from within a browser.  Ideally, I dont want to waste extra cycles with busy wait, or delay the result by waiting for long time periods simply hoping the process has finished.  I need top  ol liOpen a browser preferably Chrome with a URL, using C. li liWait for the page to completely finish loading  ideally receiving a callback of some kind.li liClose the browser page when finished, again with C.li ol  pWeve tried using IE9.  There is C support to launch IE9, Wait until not Busy, and gracefully Close the browser however, the page loads resources asynchronously there is no way around this, and so we get the signal that it is no longer busy during the resource load  instead of when the page has finished.  Adding busy wait would consume valuable serverside cpu cycles.p  pA simple Create Process call would be nice, but would only work if the browser could close itself with some html  but thanks to security measures in the browsers, I cant find a reliable way to use html commands to close a browser that was launched from commandline I did see you can close tabs spawned from an already opened page  firefox only, but this doesnt help.p  pDoes anyone know how I can accomplish this goal  Again  there is no human involvement in any of the process, no human eyes will ever see the page or interact with it in any way.  The page only runs on the server machine, and will never be deployed to a client machine. p

Negative 63960 pIm using the osdev wiki as a resource for programming an OS. So far Ive got a 2 stage bootloader, with a very minimal 32bit Protected mode kernel.p  pHowever, For the bootloader, Ive been writing to a specific sector, and reading from a specific sector, and Ive decided to do it the right way, and use a file system, so I picked the ext2 file system, as the wiki has documentation on it. So I formatted my flash drive with ext2, using gparted on Ubuntu 11.10, and grabbed lde linux disc editor, and ran it with my flash drive.p  pThe problem is that, I dont see table as described on the ext2 page, Ive looked at byte 1024 0x400, among other places, and I cant seem to find the table. I went back into gparted, and its still formatted. Also, lde says unrecognized file system, even when I specify that its ext2. Does a flash drive not use the standard ext2 file system, has the file system been changed so much that it resemble that described on the page, or am I just not looking in the right placep  pLinksp  pExt2  a hrefhttpwiki.osdev.orgExt2 relnofollowhttpwiki.osdev.orgExt2ap  pOsDev Wiki  a hrefhttpwiki.osdev.orgMainPage relnofollowhttpwiki.osdev.orgMainPageap
Negative 63960 pI need to build a DLL that can then be loaded with JNI from a java program. I was able to do this last year and it worked fine. Im trying to recompile my same .cpp file now though that I make the dll with and it is failing because of an included dll dependency that gets brought in. p  pI have a c program that calls about 5 functions from some existing C code here. These functions are part of a huge codebase that are normally all linked together to build a set of 5 dlls. p  pI use dependency walker to view my dll and last year it compiled with just 2 dependent system dlls being put in my dll. Today Im trying to recompile the same dll, but it brings in a 3rd dll file if I link with the .lib file from our existing codebase that contains the functions I use. p  pBasically I know my dll will work fine with JNI if I can avoid that 3rd dll showing up in my program. The problem is I dont know how to reference the functions I need in my code from our existing code base without linking to the lib file. p  pI can get this to work with standard c files and methods. This problem only happens when I reference this preexisting code from our huge codebase. p  pIf I do not link my .obj file with a .lib file from our code I get unresolved reference messages from my Borland 5.5 compiler I have to use. p  pThe overall issue is that my dll file works fine when I call it from a c exe file, but Java cannot handle something in it. Also, if I compile my code into a .so file in unix instead of a windows dll, Java JNI works fine and can load it. I know the problem is related to how Windows uses dlls, and I know if this 3rd dll doesnt load as part of my dll it will also work. I just have no idea what I did last year to build my dll without this 3rd one showing as a dependency. p  pIf I comment out the functions from our existing code it compiles fine and loads because the 3rd dll dependency doesnt get put in my dll. p  hr  h2More Detailsh2  pI had a message about missing strcopy, so I linked in the cw32mti.lib file and that went away, but then that cw32mti.dll shows up in my dll file. How do I prevent the missing reference message for something like that and prevent it from putting the dll in my dllp  pMy link command looks like this. ilink32 mydll.obj, mydll.dll,,cw32mtip  pThe only way I get the other missing references to work is adding the other dll to my link command like ilink32 mydll.obj, mydll.dll,,cw32mti.lib other.libp  pWhere other.dll contains functions I call from mydll.dll such as calculateint a, int b, so my code has a link it in like calculatenum1, num2 The problem is when I use the lib that contains the calculate method, it also brings in other dlls linked to the other.dll that I do not want to load. I need to be able to call calculatenum1, num2 without adding other.dll to mydll.dll. This worked before without dynamically calling calculate and using the getprocaddress type of coding. p  hr  pUpdate  I eventually had to give up on getting the windows dll to work with the smartheap memory manager. Since this code was deployed in unix, I was able to just build the .so files and get those to work with JNI. For the Windows dll compile, I put some conditional compiler statements around the JNI code that was causing the smartheap dll to be loaded, so then when it compiles in windows it does not use that code. Instead I just had it print out a statement saying it was not executing in windows. p  pWe also ran into issues later with getting our 64 bit JBoss server to run and load these 32 bit .so files. I ended up running a parallel JBoss server next to the 64bit one and called the methods that referenced the 32 bit library on the 32 bit instance of JBoss. p  pIt may evolve into more later, but for now this task is working for us after months of trying many different things. I appreciate all of the help and input here. p
Negative 63960 pIm using two serversportal and LMS servercontent and SSO for authentication. Once a user is authenticated with the portal he will access LMS Server without authentication as the same session is created on LMS Server due to the SSO.p  pI want to synchronize the sessions of these two servers.

Create parallel matrix, specifying only its global dimensions.      When using MatCreate, the matrix format can be specified at      runtime. Also, the parallel partitioning of the matrix is      determined by PETSc at runtime.       Performance tuning note  For problems of substantial size,      preallocation of matrix memory is crucial for attaining good       performance. See the matrix chapter of the users manual for details.      ierr  MatCreatePETSCCOMMWORLD,ampACHKERRQierr   ierr  MatSetSizesA,PETSCDECIDE,PETSCDECIDE,mn,mnCHKERRQierr   ierr  MatSetFromOptionsACHKERRQierr   ierr  MatMPIAIJSetPreallocationA,5,PETSCNULL,5,PETSCNULLCHKERRQierr   ierr  MatSeqAIJSetPreallocationA,5,PETSCNULLCHKERRQierr           Currently, all PETSc parallel matrix formats are partitioned by      contiguous chunks of rows across the processors.

Each processor needs to insert only elements that it owns         locally but any nonlocal elements will be sent to the         appropriate processor during matrix assembly.         Always specify global rows and columns of matrix entries.       Note this uses the less common natural ordering that orders first      all the unknowns for x  h then for x  2h etc Hence you see J  Ii  n      instead of J  I  m as you might expect.

When using VecCreate, VecSetSizes and VecSetFromOptions         in this example, we specify only the         vectors global dimension the parallel partitioning is determined         at runtime.         When solving a linear system, the vectors and matrices MUST         be partitioned accordingly.  PETSc automatically generates         appropriately partitioned matrices and vectors when MatCreate         and VecCreate are used with the same communicator.          The user can alternatively specify the local vector and matrix         dimensions when more sophisticated partitioning is needed         replacing the PETSCDECIDE argument in the VecSetSizes statement         below.      ierr  VecCreatePETSCCOMMWORLD,ampuCHKERRQierr   ierr  VecSetSizesu,PETSCDECIDE,mnCHKERRQierr   ierr  VecSetFromOptionsuCHKERRQierr   ierr  VecDuplicateu,ampbCHKERRQierr    ierr  VecDuplicateb,ampxCHKERRQierr           Set exact solution then compute righthandside vector.

Negative 63960 pIm creating a website and as I am thoroughly enjoying using SASSCompass for organizing my CSS, I came to the idea of making my website themable. p  pAt first, I was thinking to simply have a set of say 8 variables that represent the colors of a theme palette. Next, all CSS rules will use those colors, or lighteneddarkened versions of it for shadows, overlays, gradients and glows.p  pThen I came to the crazy idea of having a single theme base color, after which the rest of the palette is calculated from that. For examplep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comAnCJ4.png altenter image description herep  pIn this tool, I picked a single base color the green at the inside of the circle, after which it generated a full color palette based on that see right, in this case it is an analogic color scheme.p  pMy question is if the alghoritm in use by this tool can be replicated in SASS, so that I can have a single configurable color, whilst SASS calculates the rest of the color scheme.p  pI know some of you may doubt the usefulness of this exercise, but I think of it as a fun experiment.p
Negative 63960 pI am really interested in eventdriven programming in C especially with sockets so i am going to dedicate some time doing my researches.br Lets assume that I want to build a program with much File and Network IO like a clientserver app, basically the first question is what is the philosophy behind this model. While in normal programming I would spawn new processes, how come a single process can actually service many other requests. For example there are some webservers which can handle connections without creating threads or other processes, just one main process.p  pI know this is complicated but its always nice to at least know how the infrastructure of these kind of programming is.p

The only difference in each of the files is the name of the log file. So we end up with multiple, almost identical files spread across many servers.p  pMy question, is there any way to parameterize, or extend the properties file in such a way that we could just pass in the name of the instance and use that inside the file Thus wed only have one file per server. We dont have the option of modifying the application code and we need to pass the file in at application start up.p
Negative 63960 pIm have some to little experience in SVN. Were using Cornerstone as our SVN client in our iOS Xcode development.p  pAs per norm, for every project, we have branchestagstrunk.

From development branch, the main branch will be merged. And so on for trunk.p  pUnfortunately, all the commit logs that has been done in developer branch will be lost after we do the branch Reintegration in order to have a clean copy of merged changes from all developersp  pSo what would be the best practice for us to keep track the commit logs while at the same time be able to rebranch to get merged changes from all other developersp  pIf theres a way to do it from Cornerstone, would be much appreciated.p

Negative 63960 pI have a Web service based application, where the web server is running in the application on a particular port. Recently in the production environment, I have noticed that application is sending a RST packet to the client side resetting the connection. After analyzing the TCP dump, I have observed that the TCP 4 way connection closure is not happening properly. After sending a response from application web server to the client, the application is sending a FIN packet to the client and receiving an ACK, but there is no FIN packet initiation from the client side to the application, instead some request packet is received. At this point, the application sends a RST packet to the client as the application was expecting a FIN packet initiation from the client. This results in loss of the request packet. I believe this is a normalexpected behavior of the web server application and needs to be fixed in the client side. p  pPlease comment on the above scenario. your comments will be much appreciated.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 63960 pLets consider a simple classp  precodetemplatelt typename T gt class Wrapper  public    Constructors private   T wrapped  codepre  pWhat constructors should it use to be effectivep  hr  pBefore C0x there would be a constructor that takes eitherp  ol liconst reference codeT constampcode  if type codeTcode is heavy,li lior value codeTcode  if type codeTcode is light.li ol  pDetermining whether type codeTcode is heavy or light is not easy.p  pOne could assume only buildin types intsfloats... are light. But that is not fully correct since our own codeWrapperltintgtcode most likely should be considered a light type as well.p  pLibraries like a hrefhttpwww.boost.orgdoclibs1500libsutilitycalltraits.htm relnofollowcodeboostcalltraitscodea provide some means to overcome this difficulty by allowing type creator to mark the type as light by providing proper codecalltraitscode specialization. Otherwise it will be treated as heavy. Seems acceptable.p  hr  pBut C0x makes it worse. Because now you have also rvalue reference codeTampampcode which allows to efficiently take some heavy objects.p  pAnd because of this now you have to chose amongp  ol lijust const reference codeT constampcode  if type codeTcode is heavy and does not support move semantics because either there is none  like with large PODs  or none was written and you have no influence on that,li liboth const reference codeT constampcode and rvalue reference codeTampampcode  if type codeTcode is heavy and does support move semantics,li lijust value codeTcode  if type codeTcode is light or if it is heavy but supports move semantics even if copy is made it doesnt bother use since otherwise we would have to copy from codeT constampcode ourselves anyway....li ol  pStill its not easy to tell which types are heavy and which are light as previously. But now you are also unable to tell whether type codeTcode supports move semantics or not or are you.p  hr  pThis becomes even more annoying once you wrap more than one value since number of possible constructor overloads grows exponentially.p  pIs there any solution to that problemp  pI though about some template constructors for forwarding perfect forwarding arguments but I wasnt sure whether that would work as desired. And also it would allow to provide values of different type that would be just forwarded to codeTcode constructor. This might be considered a feature but does not have to.p

The procedure in the delphiapp stays active until the dll ExportedFunc is finished.  So the MyString var gets NOT disposed after the procedure ends. My question now is Is it possible to CHANGE the value of MyString within the DLL technically possible... But How The string is null terminated so the user knows how long the pointer length is. But if the C DLL changes the value , doesnt have the user also alloc new space or something Or does this happen automatically p  pThanks for your help.p

Negative 63960 pRecently Ive had some problems with people cheating using an app for root users called Gamecih. Gamecih lets users pause games and change variables in runtime.p  pIf I obfuscate my code I though itll be hard for cheaters to know what variables to change in runtime, but Im also worried it might cause some other problems.p  pI serialize game objects using Javas Serializable interface and then write them out to a file. Now lets say Im serializing an object of the class Player. It gets serialized and saved to a file. Then a user downloads the update with the Proguard implementation. Proguard will rename classes and class member names. Wont that cause major errors when trying to read in an already saved Player objectp  pIf I had not yet launched my game, this wouldnt be a problem. But now some players are playing on the same saved gameits an RPG for months. They would be pretty pissed off if they downloaded an update and had to start over from scratch.p  pI know I can instruct Proguard not to obfuscate certain classes, but its the Player class I really need to obfuscate.p  pClarification Lets say I have the following simple emunobfuscatedem classp  precodepublic class Player       private int gold     private String name     Lots more.      public PlayerString name              this.name  name          public int getGold          return gold          public void setGoldint gold          this.gold  gold          public String getName          return name          public void setNameString name          this.name  name       codepre  pA player is created, serialized and saved to a file. After I implement obfuscator, it might look like this p  precodepublic class Axynasf       private int akdmakn     private String anxcmjna      public AxynasfString adna              anxcmjnaadna          public int getAkdmakn          return akdmakn          public void setAkdmaknint akdmakn          this.akdmakn  akdmakn          public String getAnxcmjna          return anxcmjna          public void setAnxcmjnaString anxcmjna          this.anxcmjna  anxcmjna       codepre  pImagine that I post an update now and a player that has an unobfuscated version of Player downloads that update. When trying to read that Object there will be different member names and a different class name. Ill most likely get ClassCastException or something of the sorts.p

Negative 63960 pIm having difficulties testing python functions that return an iterable, like functions that are yielding or functions that simply return an iterable, like codereturn imapf, someitercode or codereturn permutations[1,2,3]code.p  pSo with the permutations example, I expect the output of the function to be code[1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 2, ...]code. So, I start testing my code.p  precodedef perm3   return permutations[1,2,3]   Lets ignore test framework and such details def testperm3   assertEqualperm3, [1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 2, ...] codepre  pThis will not work, since codeperm3code is an iterable, not a list. So we can fix this particular example.p  precodedef testperm3   assertEquallistperm3, [1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 2, ...] codepre  pAnd this works fine. But what if I have nested iterables That is iterables yielding iterables Like say the expressions codeproductpermutations[1, 2], permutations[3, 4]code. Now this is probably not useful but its clear that it will be once unrolling the iterators something like code[1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 4, 3, ...]code. However, we can not just wrap codelistcode around our result, as that will only turn codeiterableltblahgtcode to code[iterableltblahgt, iterableltblahgt, ...]code. Well of course I can do codemaplist, product...code, but this only works for a nesting level of 2.p  pSo, does the python testing community have any solution for the problems when testing iterables Naturally some iterables cant be tested in this way, like if you want an infinite generator, but still this issue should be common enough for somebody to have thought about this.p

Negative 63960 pI am making a database that is for employee scheduling. I am, for the first time ever, making a relational mySQL database so that I can efficiently manage all of the data. I have been using the mySQL Workbench program to help me visualize how this is going to go. Here is what I have so farp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com1mRNg.png altMock Upp  pWhat I have pictured in my head is that, based on the drawing, I would set the schedule in the codeschedulecode table which uses references from the other tables as shown. Then when I need to display this schedule, I would pull everything from the codeschedulecode table. Whenever Ive worked with a database in the past, it hasnt been of the normalized type, so I would just enter the data into one table and then pull the data out from that one table. Now that Im tackling a much larger project I am sure that having all of the tables split normalized like this is the way to go, but Im having trouble seeing how everything comes together in the end. I have a feeling it doesnt work the way I have it pictured, grossvogel pointed out what I believe to be something critical to making this all work and that is to use the codejoincode function to pull the data.p  pThe reason I started with a relational database was so that if I made a change to for example the codeshiftcode table and instead of record 1 being AM I wanted it to be Morning, it would then automatically change the relevant sections through the codecascadecode option.p  pThe reason Im posting this here is because I am hoping someone can help fill in the blanks and to point me in the right direction so I dont spend a lot of hours only to find out I made a wrong turn at the beginning.p

Negative 63960 pI have been trying to crop and save an image using Kinetic.js . I used the setCrop method of Kinetic Image and have also tried passing the crop directly into the constructoras suggested in many tutorials. I get the dataURL of the cropped image and then upload the bytes to the server where the bytes are base64 decoded and saved as a file. When i check the file on the server, it is an empty file.p  pHowever, when I try to save a whole image, the image is saved to the server, and I can view it there. I have logged the bytes into console in both cases and I can see that there is actual data in both the cases. p  pI would be very grateful for any help. Thanks in advancep
Negative 63960 pLets say I load up a python file in vim. A quick check of codescriptnamescode shows that my code.vimftpluginpythonpython.vimcode file loads as expected. One of the commands in this file highlights all characters that are past the 80th column. Now lets say I open a C file in another buffer therefore running code.vimftplugincppcpp.vimcode. Although the new commands are executed, the settings in codepython.vimcode still apply therefore characters are highlighted past the 80th column in my C file.p  pIs there anyway to make filetype commands not cumulative like this I have codefiletype plugin indent oncode in my code.vimrccode.p
Negative 63960 pI have 3 System.Drawing.Bitmap objects. A RGB foreground, RGB background, and a single byte per pixel mask image where 0 means take the background pixel and 1 means take the foreground pixel. All three are the same dimensions.p  pI chose to use the Bitmap objects because I need to eventually run this code in MonoTouch and MonoDroid. I can rethink that if needed.p  pThe code I have is optimized but still seems slow. This is also the slowest part of the whole operation so I would like to optimize it more. I also cant help but think there is some secret method that will do all this for me.p  pIf it helps. Prior to this point all 3 are byte[]s which I turn into images and resize to uniform dimensions.

Negative 63960 pI am try to see whether a certain image is a RAW image file by getting the UTI for the file, then using codeUTTypeConformsTocode to see if the images UTI conforms to public.camerarawimage, but when I try doing so, codeUTTypeConformsTocode returns false. Here is the code in questionp  precode NSNumberbwconformsToUTINSStringotherString      Boolean conformsBoolean  UTTypeConformsToCFStringRefself, CFStringRefotherString     NSNumber conforms  [NSNumber numberWithBoolconformsBoolean]     return conforms  codepre  pthe method is written as a category on NSString, and the lines are split apart like that because I was making sure in the debugger that there wasnt anything funny going on with converting from a Boolean to a BOOL and losing bits conformsBoolean definitely comes back as all 0 bitsp  pIf self is com.canon.cr2rawimage and otherString is public.camerarawimage, I would expect this to return YES, but instead it results in NO. I tracked down where the com.canon.cr2rawimage UTI is defined, and found it in SystemLibraryCoreServicesCoreTypes.bundleContentsLibraryRawCameraTypes.bundleInfo.plist where it does indeed specify that com.canon.cr2rawimage conforms directly to public.camerarawimage. I did notice that this is declare as an imported UTI and not an exported UTI, but since my application does recognize the declaration as evidenced that I got that string in the first place via codeUTTypeCreatePreferredIdentifierForTagcode, I dont think that should make a difference.p  pIs there anything obviously wrong that Im doing or misunderstanding herep

Negative 63960 pAfter much fiddling Im beginning to suspect that theres a bug in the spacing code of the UICollectionViewFlowLayout. p  pThe problem is simple enough I have five buttons I want to show on screen and I want the spacing between buttons to be 1 pt2 pixels on retina display. To achieve this I have set the minimumInteritemSpacing to 1.0 and the cell width to 159.5 pt such that two cells will add up to 319 pt leaving a single point for the space. The problem appears when I want the third button to be the full width of the view because the flow layout causes the spacing to be 0.5 pt despite having been told to keep a minimum of 1.0. see screenshot 1p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comLLiro.jpg altright layout wrong spacingp  pThe code for setting up the spacing happens in p  precodevoidviewDidLoad      UICollectionViewFlowLayout flowLayout  UICollectionViewFlowLayout [[self collectionView] collectionViewLayout]     [flowLayout setMinimumInteritemSpacing1.0]     [flowLayout setMinimumLineSpacing1.0]          codepre  pand the sizing of the cells inp  precode CGSizecollectionViewUICollectionView collectionView layoutUICollectionViewLayout collectionViewLayout sizeForItemAtIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath      if indexPath.row  2          return CGSizeMake320 ,151          return CGSizeMake159.5, 151  codepre  pIf, on the other hand, I dont make the third button full width the spacing behaves as expected though it shouldnt affect the inter item spacing of a different row. screenshot 2p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comHCcAn.png altright spacing wrong layoutp  pIt should be noted that the CollectionView, CollectionViewCell and UILabel are set up in the storyboard and that Ive already made sure the frame of the label visible in the screenshots is less than the cells width and I have also tried removing the label altogether but with the same result.p  pI cant see why this is happening unless it is a bug in the flow layout code and I was looking for a sanity check here before submitting this as a bug.p

Negative 63960 pI have a strange problem that I shall try to explain as best I can. I have a header and in that header there is a menu. When the site first loads, it loads main.php and if I click the link in the menu to open a dialog window, nothing happens. However, if I navigate to another page, the link will work. I am having trouble understanding why this is happening as the menu is loading correctly when the header loads. I would be grateful if anyone could offer some suggestions as to things I can try.

It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at HampdenSydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum The Extremes of Good and Evil by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.., comes from a line in section 1.10.32.  The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H.

Negative 63960 pIm obviously missing something simple here and looking for some expert input. Ive been trying to create a simple bar chart with an xaxis timeline using d3 where the dataset will update upon the click of a button. Each dataset will be of different lengths depending upon user input ultimately and most prominently the time range selected. In order to address my particular problem, I have extracted just two datasets stored in the variables live and test contained in the code supplied below, also replicated within a jsFiddle a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netjimaroonie6WBEU relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netjimaroonie6WBEUap  pMy problem is that I cant get the bars to update with the values of the new dataset. The data is changing as the length of the dataset determines the width of each bar which clearly works when you click the update button notice Im using the ordinal scale to drive this aspect whereas the xaxis uses the time scale format compare the xord and x variable below.p  pSo, where am I going wrong I think I might be missing something with the selection hierarchy, or how the data is being appended to if at all.

Negative 63960 pIm new to Backbone, and Im very confused about whats happening when I pass a JSON array of objects to a Backbone Collection.p  pIm fetching some JSON from a spreadsheet hosted on Google Drive. Im parsing that data, as the actual data that I want to use in my collection is deeply nested. In my parse function, if I log the length of my desired array, I get 157 thats correct. I then pass that array into a Backbone Collection, and the length of my collection is 1 incorrect. Its as though foo.bar.length  157, but there is only one bar in foo, so when I pass foo.bar into the collection, it takes foo.bar and not the contents of foo.bar Very confused.p  pCode below...p  precodevar table  new TableView  TableItem  Backbone.Model.extend,  TableItemCollection  Backbone.Collection.extend      model  TableItem,     url  httpsspreadsheets.google.comfeedslist0AjbU8ta9j916dFdjSVg3YkNPUUJnWkZSWjBDWmZab3c1publicbasicaltjsoninscript,     sync  function method, model, options           var params  .extend              type GET,             dataType jsonp,             url this.url,             processData false         , options          return .ajax params      ,     parse  function resp, xhr           console.log resp.feed.entry.length   THIS LOGS 157         return resp.feed.entry       ,  TableView  Backbone.View.extend      initialize   function  options           this.collection  new TableItemCollection         this.collection.on reset, this.parseResponse, this          this.collection.fetch              reset  true,             success  function  model, response, options                   console.log OK    THIS LOGS OK             ,             error  function  model, response, options                   console.log ERROR                             ,     parseResponse  function           console.log this.collection.length   THIS LOGS 1        codepre

Negative 63960 pSo Im trying to check if an array that was previously inputted is increasing in intervals of 1, starting with the number 1 and ending with n n being the array size.p  pHeres what I got so farp  precode    for int i 0 iltni                 for nextinextltnnext                     ifarr[i]1  arr[next]                         x  1  ignore this, it relates to the rest of the code.                                          else                         printf nThis is not a permutation.                         break                            codepre  pNow, my thinking is that this code would compare parameters that are next to each other, and if the following parameter is equal to the previous 1, then it is obviously increasing by 1. Problem is, when this is false, it wont print This is not a permutation, and wont break the loop.p  pAny help would be appreciated.p  pAlso, any insight as to checking if the array starts with the number 1 would be appreciated.p  pThanksp

Negative 63960 pHi I have an insert and an update statement. The update works fine, I have two fields, one categoryoftaxom and numberoftaxom. The update allows either one to be changed and it will update the record.p  pHowever the insert which is pretty much the same, if it is not already existing creates the record. Will work if I input values for both options, but if only one is inputted it does not submit anything The code is quite complicated, with all the variable names, but Im thinking I maybe need another if statement or something to check if just one is inputted or is this a PDO thing that all parameters need fillingp  precode   stmt6  conn gtprepareUPDATE recordtbl SET categoryoftaxom , numberoftaxom  WHERE sheetid   AND line  6    stmt6gtbindParam1, categoryoftaxom66    stmt6gtbindParam2, numberoftaxom66    stmt6gtbindParam3, sheetid       categoryoftaxom66  POST[categorySelect6fromDB]       numberoftaxom66  POST[numberoftaxom6]    stmt6gtexecute               echo Saved      else                              if issetPOST[categorySelect6fromDB]           categoryoftaxom66  POST[categorySelect6fromDB]          paramcat  PDOPARAMINT     else           categoryoftaxom66  NULL          paramcat  PDOPARAMNULL       if issetPOST[numberoftaxom6]           numberoftaxom66  POST[numberoftaxom6]          paramnum  PDOPARAMINT   else           numberoftaxom66  NULL         paramnum  PDOPARAMNULL    stmt66  conn gtprepareINSERT INTO recordtbl line, taxomid, categoryoftaxom, numberoftaxom, sheetid VALUES 6,6,,,             stmt66gtbindParam1, categoryoftaxom66, paramcat             stmt66gtbindParam2, numberoftaxom66, paramnum             stmt66gtbindParam3, sheetid           stmt66gtexecute             echo New Record Inserted                             codepre

Negative 63960 pIm working on a program that precompiles bytecode from .NET assemblies.  This program is itself a .NET program  so far Ive been able to use reflection to extract all the needed information including the bytecode itself.  However, Ive run into a problem implementing the translation for codeldfldcode.p  pcodeldfldcode and similar instructions have a metadata token within their encoding which references a emFieldRefem or emFieldDefem.  I understand these are elements in metadata tables embedded in the assemblys PE file.  In the worstcase I do have enough information from ECMA335 to open the PE file and look all this up myself, but thats a lot of work and is not consistent with other information which I do get through Reflection, so I would prefer to do this lookup via Reflection.p  pHowever, I cant seem to find any methods on codeSystem.Reflection.Assemblycode that look up a metadata token.  I may have just missed it.  I cant do the lookup on anything more specific than an assembly because I only know the referencing assembly until I see the metadata catch22.  In fact, as noted in the comments, I dont even know what assembly the field is emdefinedem in, until examining the metadata.p  pIs there any way to look up such metadata tokens via Reflectionp

But how come we for instance use m10 for a table of 10 elements when it should be m20 to create that extra empty spacep  pCan someone please help me understand how to calculate the value of m to use based on different scenarios like when we want to have a static where we know that we will only insnert like 10 elements or dynamic rehash after a certain limit hashtable.p  h2Lets illustrate my problem by the following examplesh2  pI got the values 1,2,...,np  pQuestion What would be a optimized value of m if I must use the division by mod in my hashfunctionp  pstrongSenario 1 n  100strongp  pstrongSenario 2 n  5043strongp  pstrongAddition questionstrong Would the m value hashfunction be different if we used a open or closed hashtablep  pNote that im now not in need to understand hashtable for java but hashtable in general where I must use a divsion mod hashfunction.p  pThank you for your timep

Negative 63960 pAlright, let me try to explain.p  pI have an application where I can trigger some sort of scan process. This scan process launches just a number 10 background workers which do something. After again, just a number 5 seconds I would like top  ul liKill all the background workers Im using CancelAsync for thatli liDo some calculation with the data I got from all of themli liUpdate the UI so the data is displayed AND enable some buttons these buttons are bound through a codeViewModelcode Command called codePerformUpdateCommandcode and they have a codeCanExecutecode property of codeIsPerformUpdateAllowedcode. The codeIsPerformUpdateAllowedcode dependency property is set when my tasks finish.li ul  pWhat I thought I would dop  ul liAfter triggering the Background Workers, start a dispatcher timer with a 5 second interval. li liWhen the codeDispatcherTimercode ticks I calculate the data and set the property codeIsPerformUpdateAllowedcode to either true or false.li ul  pThis basically works as expected the UI stays responsive, ... with just a minor hickup The UI is not being updated the button is not enabled. As soon as I put the window into the background and back into the foreground, the command is enabled, also the codeIsPerformUpdateAllowedcode property is set to true. Also, when I press the button in disabled state after pressing it, it will be enabled.p  pSo, although I set the dependency property correctly, the UI does not react to this change. p  pAnybody knows why Interestingly, I also set some text in the UI into a label  this text is updated correctly. Its just that the property which tells the command codeCanExecutecode does not trigger a UI update.p  pCode for the initialization of the timer.p  precode        scanTimer  new DispatcherTimer         scanTimer.Interval  new TimeSpan0, 0, 0, 3         scanTimer.Tick  delegate                       After the timer has elapsed some time passed, cancel all scans and update the result             scanTimer.Stop             UpdateScanResults             CancelNormalScansfalse                  scanTimer.Start codepre  pCode how the Command is bound to the WPF element the button is actually a Hyperlinkp  precode            ltLabel Grid.Row1 Grid.Column1gt                 ltHyperlink CommandBinding ReadSettingsCommandgt                     ltTextBlock TextBinding SourceStaticResource Loc, PathLabels.ReadSettingsgtltTextBlockgt                 ltHyperlinkgt             ltLabelgt codepre  pHere is the code for the Commandp  precode    public RelayCommand ReadSettingsCommand              get                      return readSettingsCommand                  readSettingsCommand  new RelayCommandExecuteReadSettings,  gt IsScannedDeviceAvailable ampamp IsUpdateInProgress               codepre  pThe code is actually dependent on two dependency properties IsScannedDeviceAvailable AND NOT IsUpdateInProgress. Both are dependency properties.p  pUPDATE I just read that the binding to the CanExecute property is just one time. If you want it to revalidate you need to call RaiseCanExecuteChanged on the command. This works, but it is somewhat cumbersome, since now I need to call it manually every time one of the two properties change. Actually I wanted that to be handled automatically. Any ideas on how this can be done more easily Isnt there some method to have kind of a oneway binding between CanExecute and the propertyp

There is no other way in my situation p  pThe question is only about strongnegative side effectsstrong, not if its possiblep

Negative 63960 pI have a codeUICollectionViewcode on codeiOS7code which crashes randomly when intense scrolling. I enabled zombies and found that it gives me an error sayingp  precode [NSIndexPath section] message sent to deallocated instance 0x17dbc970 codepre  pI believe this is due to an Apple error described a hrefhttpsgithub.comIgorTavcarUICollectionViewBug relnofollowherea. Apparently, the app crashes when someone highlights a cell while scrolling fast, and then the OS tries to unhighlight it when it moves off screen, when it ceases to exist. The proposed solution is to disable the codeuserInteractionEnabledcode property of the cell and then handle the selection using codeUIGestureRecognisercode. p  pHas anyone else faced this same issue Also, I tried unsetting the codeuserInteractionEnabledcode property and using a gesture recogniser, but this doesnt seem to work.

I have set region monitoring when app enters background but still I am not getting motion updates.p  pIs there any way other than calling startUpdatingLocation to get motion activity updates in suspended statep

Negative 63960 pI find myself in a situation that calls for rapid instantiation and deletion of many objects, which ends up taking a lot of CPU and user time, so I need to shave off as much as possible from that process. I do realize a nonvirtual destructor will not be a significant gain, but it will still save a few percent of the time, and together with a few other optimizations will stack into a tangible improvement from a users perspective.p  pI know that the rule of thumb is that in such polymorphic hierarchies it is recommended practice to begin with making the destructor virtual, so that when objects are deleted the appropriate code is ran to do all the necessary cleanup. p  pBut what if it didnt matter which destructor will be called What if all the subclass specific dynamic data that needs collecting is packed and instantiated in the specific constructor to a pointer dedicated for that purpose in the verybaseclass In this case, every object can instantiate and access it specific plus inherited dynamic data through the pointer which is collected by the base class destructor which can be inlined, so regardless of its actually content and size that dynamic memory will be deallocated by the OS, which only needs the address and does not care about size, so no memory leaks, no overhead from virtual calls.p  pSo, does this sound like a good idea Any potential pitfallsp  pEDIT A simple testp  precodeclass A    public   A cout ltlt A ltlt endl    class B  public A    public   B cout ltlt B ltlt endl    int main     A  a  new A    A  b  new B    B  br  new B     delete a    delete b    delete br     return 0  codepre  poutput p  precodeA A B A codepre  pSo regardless of what pointer is deleted, the base class destructor which collects all memory is called no matter what.

Negative 63960 pEveryone knows that MRTG needs at least one value to be passed on its input.p  pIn pertarget options MRTG has gauge, absolute and default with no options behavior of what to do with incoming data. Or, how to count it.p  pLets look at the elementary, yet popular example p  pWe pass cumulative data from network interface statistics of how much packets were recieved by the interface.p  pWe take it from procnetdev or look at ifconfig output for certain network interface. The number of recieved bytes is increasing every time. Its cumulative.p  pSo as i can imagine there could be two types of possible statistics 1. How fast this value changes upon the time interval. In oher words  activity. 2. Simple, asis growing graphic that just draw every new value per every minute or any other time interwalp  pFirst graphic will be saltatory activity. Second will just grow up every time. p  pI read twice rrdtools and MRTGs docs and cant understand which option mentioned above counts what. p  pI suppose i am not sure that gauge draw values as is, without any differentiation calculations good for measuring how much memory or cpu is used every 5 minutes. And default or absolute behavior tryes to calculate the speed between nearby measures, but whats the differencr between last two p  pCan you, guys, explain in a simple manner which behavior stands after which option of three options possiblep  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 63960 pI am writing a java web application using spring, hibernate and mysql. The applications is getting larger so I want to break it into smaller parts e.g. smaller projects, components or which ever way possible. For example I have login and image uploading functionality, I dont want both of these to be in a single code base or project. I want to be able to use these separately almost like separate services independent of each other. Is there a way of doing this e.g. convert the image uploading functionality into a jar and then reference this jar in the actual project How are the Enterprise projects split p  pHope it make makes sense and please advice if I am going the right direction as it is my first project It would be nice if someone can point me to a mini example or recommend reading.p  pthanks in advancep

Negative 63960 pI had a programming assignment given to me to recreate sorting algorithms, well they all seem to do just fine except my Bubble Sort. I have been looking at this code and I just cannot seem to figure it out. Im hoping you guys can see where I am going wrong. In the book Im given the psuedocodep  precodeBubbleSortlist,N list is the elements to be put in order  N is the number of elements in the list numberOfPairs  N swappedElements  true whileswappedElements do            numberOfPairs  numberOfPairs1   swappedElements  false   fori  1 to numberOfPairs then     iflist[i] gtlist[i1]then       swaplist[i], list[i1]       swappedElements  true     end if   end for end while codepre  pok so thats what Im given. So then I create this classp  precodepublic class BubbleSort       private int[] unsorted     private int number     private int compareCount  0     private int swapCount  0     private boolean swap

This codeltulgtcode is then stripped of its codeltligtcode elements, and these are joined and then thrown into a localStorage item as a delineated list. In a codefunctioncode this list is processed and an array is created. p  pI need to pass this array from a codeltscriptgtcode running in strongpopup.jsstrong to a content script, stronginject.jsstrong, which is injected into a a hrefhttpstwitter.com relnofollowhttpstwitter.comemema page. As an aside, I have made all necessary manifest entries. Ive read the chrome extension documentation, and many stackoverflow answers, yet I have not yet gotten a clear understanding of what I need to do in order to wrap the array passing logic into a function which simply makes the array available to stronginject.jsstrong. p  pLets say that the array is created in popup.js something like thisp  precode inside popup.js var list  function getList      lists[list]  localStorage[myAwesomeList].split     return lists   function sendListToInjectJs      list  getList       some amzing code that makes my script available to inject.js    codepre  pAs shown above, Id like a function that, when called, sends the created array to stronginject.jsstrong where it is held in a variable for processingp  precode in inject.js var list  listPassedFromPopupJs   sweet list processing here codepre  pI really feel like this should be easier than Ive found. It seems like i should be able to say to stronginject.jsstrong, hey, heres an updated version of that array. Do something with it.p  pstrongThank you in advance for any insight in how to accomplish this My extension will be complete once this bridge is gapped.strongp

Negative 63960 pI have a tree structure of objects, and their properties have very complicated dependencies on surrounding objects determined by where they are in the tree.  I have hard coded a lot of these dependencies, and tried to create some sort of update loop where if a property gets updated, based on the design, all of the properties that depend on it get updated, and in the correct order, but I want to handle it in a more genericabstract way, instead of hard coding a bunch of update calls to different objects.p  pLets say, for example, I have 1 superclass, and 3 subclasses, and then a separate container object.p  pstrongShapestrongbr properties parentContainer, index, left, top, width, heightbr methods updateLeft, updateTop, updateWidth, updateHeightp  pstrongSquare inherits from Shapebr Triangle inherits from Shapebr Circle inherits from Shapestrong  p  pstrongShapeContainerstrongbr properties shapesbr methods addShapeshape, index, removeShapeindexp  pIll give a pseudocode example update method to illustrate how these dependencies crop up  p  precodeSquare.updateTop      var prevShape  null     if this.index  0          prevShape  this.parentContainer.shapes[this.index  1]          var nextSquareInContainer  null     for var i  this.index i lt this.parentContainer.shapes.length i          var shape  this.parentContainer.shapes[i]         ifshape instanceof Square              nextSquareInContainer  shape             break                   var top  0     if prevShape  null ampamp nextSquareInContainer  null          top  prevShape.top  nextSquareInContainer.width      else          top  22          this.top  top    codepre  pSo, any square objects added to the shapeConatiner will depend on the previous shapes top value and the next square found in the containers width value for its top value.  p  pHere is some code to set up an example shape containerp  precodevar shapeContainer  new ShapeContainer var triangle  new Triangle var circle  new Circle var square1  new Square var square2  new Square shapeContainer.addShapetriangle, 0 shapeContainer.addShapecircle, 1 shapeContainer.addShapesquare1, 2 shapeContainer.addShapesquare2, 3 codepre  pSo, I guess the crux of the issue is, if I update the above circles top value, I want the top value of square1 to be automatically updated because there is a one way dependency between square1s top value, and circles top value.  So one way I can do this the way Ive been doing it, in combination with some other specific knowledge of my problem domain to simplify the calls, is to add the code similar to the following to Circles updateTop method really it would have to be added to each shapes updateTop methodp  precodeCircle.updateTop       Code to actually calculate and update Circles top value, note this      may depend on its own set of dependencies     var nextShape  this.parentContainer.shapes[this.index  1]     if nextShape instanceof Square          nextShape.updateTop       codepre  pThis type of design is fine for a few simple dependencies between objects, but my project has dozens of types of objects with probably hundreds of dependencies between their properties.  Ive coded it this way, but it is very difficult to reason about when trying to add new features, or troubleshoot a bug.p  pIs there some sort of design pattern out there to set up dependencies between object properties, and then when one property is updated,  it updates all of the properties on other objects that depend on it which may then trigger further updating of properties that depend on the now newly updated properties Some sort of declarative syntax for specifying these dependencies would probably be best for readabilitymaintainability.p  pAnother issue is, a property may have several dependencies, that ALL must be updated before I want that property to update itself.p  pIve been looking into a pubsub type of solution, but I thought this was a complicated enough problem to reach out for help.  As a side note, Im working in javascript.p

Negative 63960 pIve been using Boosts ASIO library to do network and socket communication. Now Im getting to a point in the development cycle where Id like to clean things up and make them a little more modular. My first thought was that I would use a separate project for just the network communication part essentially factoring out the Boostdependent stuff and use one visual studio project in two different visual studio solutions. Something likep  precodeClient.sln gt  Client.vcxproj gt  Networking.vcxproj  Server.sln gt  Server.vcxproj gt  Networking.vcxproj codepre  pI tried to do this, but I have the problem that my Networking.vcxproj has turned into a headeronly project due to the fact that Im creating nothing but template classes. What I would ideally like to do is place the references to the boost precompiled libs only in the Networking.vcxproj and link against the output of Networking.vcxproj. However, if I understand correctly, theres nothing to link against since my Networking.vcxproj has no .cpp files.p  pIs there any way to link against my Networking project and the boost ASIO libs without specifying all the additional library dependencies in all the projects i.e. Is there any way to somehow create the project settings so that I dont have to duplicate the boost library dependencies every time I create a new application which uses the Networking.vcxproj projectp

Negative 63960 pthis is my first time asking a question on here, and I can usually find what I need just from seaching, however this time Im stuck and Im hoping someone here can help.p  pHeres the gist. I have created a database for a hair dressing studio. there are five tables. The only ones this question deals with is the Customers table stores customer details, the ProductSales table store details about each product sale, and HairCuts table, store details about each cut.p  pI need a query that will list the total spent on both hair cuts and products for each customer in the customers table.p  pI have two separate queries that work fine. Each one calculates the total spent by each customer for EITHER hair cuts or products. I need to somehow combine these into one that will show the total.p  precodeSELECT c.customerID, c.firstName, c.lastname,  SUMhc.cost AS hcsalestotal FROM Customers c, HairCuts hc WHERE c.customerID  hc.customerID GROUP BY c.customerID  SELECT c.customerID, c.firstName, c.lastname,  SUMps.cost AS pssalestotal FROM Customers c,ProductSales ps WHERE c.customerID  ps.customerID GROUP BY c.customerID codepre  pI believe the issues I am havng are stemming from the fact that, while all customers have purchased at least one hair cut, not all have purchased products. Anyway, any help would be much appreciated.p

Negative 63960 pSo Im working through Sams Teach Yourself C Programming in One Hour a Day, Seventh Edition Lesson 10 Exercise 7 which asks to Write a function that accepts two strings. Use the malloc function to allocate enough memory to hold the two strings after they have been concatenated linked.

Negative 63960 pWith my question I suspect a lot of people may get confused between dynamic styling what you can achieve by jQuerys .css function and dynamic CSS rules. The first is where it only changes the styles of existing elements matching the selector. But what I am after is adjusting the rule so any new elements matching the selector will also use that dynamic rule.p  pAs an example lets take a set of DIVs with class pane.p  pI can change the background color of existing panes using code.pane.cssbackgroundcolor 00fcodep  pBut if I then add a new pane codebody.appendltdiv classpanegtltdivgtcode it wont use this new style because it isnt a rule.p  pI dont understand why addingchanging CSS rules isnt the default behaviour Was this ever discussed by a W3C working group to anyones knowledgep  pstrongDoes anyone know if it is possible to add or change CSS rules dynamically client side ie without communicating with the serverstrongp

Negative 63960 pTo initiate a query I use  p  precodeorg.apache.ibatis.session.SqlSession.seleteListmyquery codepre  pmyquery itself is defined within an XML configuration file.p  pWith Spring JDBC as the query statements is defined with the class itself it is very easy find the query associated with a given method call. But with mybatis once I reach the query call I have to search for the argument in this case myquery to discover where the actual query is defined.p  pIs there an easier method of finding a query associated with a method call instead of manually searching for references  Im thinking there isnt as since the query itself is within an XML file not a .java file and IDE maintains a linking of methods, constants etc between the files.p
Negative 63960 pI have this question for quite some time now and its really annoying.p  pId like to know if theres some way to autogenerate the DLLs I used in my project on the executable folderthe Debug folder, to be specific. I mean, the way I learned, every time I create a new project, I need to execute it first, so the Debug folder can be created, then I receive a error message saying that some DLLs are missinglike SDL2.dll, and then I copypaste the missing DLLs from the libraries I used on this folder.p  pSo, is there a way that, when executing my project for the first time, it creates the Debug folder AND the DLLs so I dont need to do it manually every single time Also, is there a way to put them in another folder and the project still finds it, for organizations sakeThis way I can have the project folder and inside it only folders for the resources and the executablep  pNOTE Im using Visual Studio 2013p

Negative 63960 pfollowing situation I got a splashscreen which has to fade in over 2 seconds from transparent to opaque. While the window nicely fades in, the program should wait until it is fully visible the Storyboard finished and then it should continue doing its stuff. While the window is fading in, the user should already see the animations of the control so blocking the UI thread is not an option, of course. And with animations I mean the loading circle which spins happily.p  pAfter I found a nice variant of how to fade in and out a window with WPFs storyboards, I tried to accomplish this by using the EventWaitHandle. As my intialization routine already runs asynchronous I was able to use it. This blocked the worker thread and stopped my application doing the initialization stuff before the Splashscreen was fully visible. But somehow this has been broken after a while and it doesnt seem to be the best solution.p  pHeres how Im doing it, currentlyp  precodepublic async Task Appeardouble time      Core.IDE.GetGUICore.GetUIDispatcher.Invoke gt              this.Opacity  0         this.Show          fadeInStoryboard  new Storyboard         fadeInStoryboard.Completed  this.FadeInAnimation         DoubleAnimation fadeInAnimation  new DoubleAnimation0.0, 1.0, new DurationTimeSpan.FromSecondstime         Storyboard.SetTargetfadeInAnimation, this         Storyboard.SetTargetPropertyfadeInAnimation, new PropertyPathOpacityProperty         fadeInStoryboard.Children.AddfadeInAnimation           currentHandle  new EventWaitHandlefalse, EventResetMode.AutoReset     Core.IDE.GetGUICore         .GetUIDispatcher         .InvokeAsyncthis.fadeInStoryboard.Begin, DispatcherPriority.Render     currentHandle.WaitOne    ltsummarygt  Hides the SplashScreen with a fadeout animation.  ltsummarygt  ltparam nametimegtThe fadeout time in seconds.ltparamgt public void Disappeardouble time      Core.IDE.GetGUICore.GetUIDispatcher.Invoke gt              fadeOutStoryboard  new Storyboard         fadeOutStoryboard.Completed  this.FadeOutAnimation         DoubleAnimation fadeOutAnimation  new DoubleAnimation1.0, 0.0,             new DurationTimeSpan.FromSecondstime         Storyboard.SetTargetfadeOutAnimation, this         Storyboard.SetTargetPropertyfadeOutAnimation, new PropertyPathOpacityProperty         fadeOutStoryboard.Children.AddfadeOutAnimation           Core.IDE.GetGUICore        .GetUIDispatcher        .BeginInvokenew ActionfadeOutStoryboard.Begin, DispatcherPriority.Render, null   private void FadeInAnimationobject sender, EventArgs e      currentHandle.Set   private void FadeOutAnimationobject sender, EventArgs e      this.Hide  codepre  pIs this the right approach Any better solutions Any ideas why it is broken By the way, with broken I mean that the application continues doing its initialization stuff whilst the window is fading in, which ends in an animation which runs until its probably at 30 visibility and then fading out because the main window already showed up.p  pThanks in advancep

Each role also has a company and leader associated with it although leader is optional as they can be the highest. There are 8 levels of users but for some companies the maximum level they may use could be 3 or 4, so it varies. p  pAs above, user 101 is under user 102 for one role and company. Then for another role user 102 is under user 101 for different company. A level 2 user can only see level 1 users which are assigned under him.p  pA level 4 user, however, can only see those level 1 users who belong to in the teams under him. If you think of it as a tree like structure, they can only see the users on their branches. Now, if I pass a userid103, how can I query whether he can be accessed by current logged in user id101. As you can see, both 100 and 101 are level 4 on the same company. However, only 101 can see 103. p  phow can query that in MySQL Or will it be better to restructure the tables for easier query.p

Negative 63960 pI am trying to handle nearsimultaneous input to my Entity Framework application. Members users can rate things, so I have a table for their ratings, where one column is the members ID, one is the ID of the thing theyre rating, one is the rating, and another is the time they rated it. The most recent rating is supposed to override the earlier ratings. When I receive input, I check to see if the member has already rated a thing or not, and if they have, I just update the rating using the existing row, or if they havent, I add a new row. I noticed that when input comes in from the same user for the same item at nearly the same time, that I end up with two ratings for that user for the same thing.p  pEarlier I asked this question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions24464109howcaniavoidduplicaterowsfromnearsimultaneoussqladdsHow can I avoid duplicate rows from nearsimultaneous SQL addsa and I followed the suggestion to add a SQL constraint requiring unique combinations of MemberID and ThingID, which makes sense, but I am having trouble getting this technique to work, probably because I dont know the syntax for doing what I want to do when an exception occurs. The exception comes up saying the constraint was violated, and what I would like to do then is forget the attemptd illegal addition of a row with the same MemberID and ThingID, and instead fetch the existing one and simply set the values to this slightly more recent data. However I have not been able to come up with a syntax that will do that. I have tried a few things and always I get an exception when I try to SaveChanges after getting the exception  either the unique constraint is still coming up, or I get a deadlock exception.p  pThe latest version I tried was like thisp  precode Get the members rating for the thing, or create it. MemberThingRating memPref  from mip in myEntities.MemberThingRating                                where mip.thingID  thingId                                where mip.MemberID  memberId                                select mip.FirstOrDefault bool RetryGet  false if memPref  null      using TransactionScope txScope  new TransactionScope              try                     memPref  new MemberThingRating            memPref.MemberID  memberId            memPref.thingID  thingId            memPref.EffectiveDate  DateTime.Now            myEntities.MemberThingRating.AddObjectmemPref            myEntities.SaveChanges                  catch Exception ex                      Thread.Sleep750             RetryGet  true                   if RetryGet  true              MemberThingRating memPref  from mip in myEntities.MemberThingRating                                        where mip.thingID  thingId                                        where mip.MemberID  memberId                                        select mip.FirstOrDefault       codepre  pAfter writing the above, I also tried wrapping the logic in a function call, because it seems like Entity Framework cleans up database transactions when leaving scope from where changes were submitted. So instead of using TransactionScope and managing the exception at the same level as above, I wrapped the whole thing inside a managing function, like thisp  precodebool Succeeded  false while Succeeded  false      Thread.Sleep750     Exception Problem  AttemptToSaveMemberIngredientPreferencememberId, ingredientId, rating     if Problem  null         Succeeded  true     else              Exception BaseEx  Problem.GetBaseException       codepre  pBut this only results in an unending string of exceptions on the unique constraint, being handled forever at the higherlevel function. I have a 34 second delay between attempts, so I am surprised that there can be a reported conflict yet still there is nothing found when I query for a row. I suppose that indicates that all of the threads are failing because they are running at the same time and Entity Framework notices them all and fails them all before any succeed. So I suppose there should be a way to respond to the exception by looking at all the submissions and adjusting them I dont know or see the syntax for that. So again, what is the way to handle thisp  pUpdate  Paddy makes three good suggestions below. I expect his Stored Procedure technique would work around the problem, but I am still interested in the answer to the question. That is, surely one should be able to respond to this exception by manipulating the submission, but I havent yet found the syntax to get it to insert one row and use the latest value.p

Negative 63960 pI am so close to implementing this myself, but before I do I would still want to know if that wheel already has been invented what I need is a library that allows me to represent a DAG directed acyclic graph and which will allow to make queries about directly or indirectly connected nodes with very high performance. I have compared two approaches so far.p  pThe graph will be a couple of millions of nodes in size with about 1020 million edges. Most nodes will only have one or two edges but a couple of thousand nodes may have 10000 edges or more.p  pThe use case would be does not really matter what the effort to create the graph is, and once it has been created it does not need to get updated, or updates need not be fast. However, finding direct connections or specific indirect connections of length 2 one intermediate node should be very fast and edges should be able to have labels e.g. weights, counts etc.. Also, the memory footprint should be small and querying should be threadsafe.p  pI have experimented with using some standard software packages for this, e.g. Neo4J or relational databases, but both are way too slow for some of the things relational databases grind to a crawl for finding indirect relations when nodes with a lot of edges are involved huge join sets. Neo4j handles that case much better, but the basic speed of just finding a direct connection is thousands of times slower than in relational database solutions. On a workstation, relational databases can return results for direct and many indirect queries in less then 5ms, but certain indirect queries can take up to a minute. With Neo4j on the same system, those indirect queries just take a few seconds, but the direct queries all take longer than 100ms. I want to be able to get my direct queries to under one ms and the worst indirect ones to under 1 second on average. p  pI think when done cleverly, this could all be represented and carried out inmemory with just a few gigs of heap space, and even for bigger graphs, there would be strategies to do these things very fast by clever caching and a clever way of how to persist parts of the graph to disk. But I could not find any solution or library preferable open source which would offer this. Did I miss anythingp

The data is not inserting to the database and i not sure how to debug this. p  pWhat can i do to see the JSON objects passed to the web service from that php script Please help.. p
Negative 63960 pI need to make a program that sort all the .jpg files in a directory, or simply all the files in the directorybecause they are all jpg, so it doesnt have to be specifically fro jpgs and that depending on the date they were made, puts them in two separate folders say for example before 2012 in one folder, and after 2012 in the other....the thing that i dont know how to do is how to i get the program to read through the properties of of all of the files.jpgs in the folder , after that i think i know what to do  store the dates in a variable , create the two folders and then i was thinking of an if statemente that transfers the files comparing their dates. But how do i tell the program to do this for every file,no matter how many they are...because i dont know how many files there are in the folder. thanks p
Negative 63960 pIm trying to get my own IP address by trying to connect to 8.8.8.8 using codeUDPcode socket and then calling codegetsocknamecode function.p  pIve written a function codegetmyipcode, and the code worked when it was placed in my server program, but as a separate function, it fails. It prints some strange characters instead of my IP address.p  pThe only thing I changed from the code in my server program was return NULL instead of return 1, or return 2, because it was inside codeint maincode.p  pCan anyone see why my program is not workingp  pThank you.p
Negative 63960 pIm somewhat new to web app development, and ran through the Yeoman tutorial, which uses codeyocode, codegruntcode, codebowercode, and codeangularcode. p  pI had used homebrew to install codenodecode and codenpmcode, but kept getting errors with codenpmcode due to some permissions and whatnot. I uninstalled codenodecode using codebrewcode, and instead used codenvmcode to install codenodecode and codenpmcode, which no longer gives me errors. p  pBUT, codenvmcode is somewhat annoying. I understand its a codenodecode version manager, and Im fine with having to codenvm use 0.10code every time I open a shell. But now, whenever I want to codegrunt servecode my web app from a new shell, I need to install gruntclip  precodenvm use 0.10 npm install g gruntcli  ... grunt serve codepre  pIs codegruntclicode not installing globally Or is it meaningless, because codenpmcode doesnt stick around between different shells p  pBasically, Im fine with just using one version of node right now. How do I set up codenvmcode, codenpmcode, and codegruntcode so I dont have to reinstall codegruntcode every time I open a new shell p

Negative 63960 pI have a variable, codeDEPScode, which is a list of libs, e.g. codelibsa libsbcode.

But say I have a library, codelibsccode that depends on the other two, and my app depends on it.

Negative 63960 pI used to execute a script that at the end would distribute an email using Microsoft Outlook and a custom form. I found a website that told you how to create a custom form, insert some VBA script into it and then create a an application link that you could double click to send the email. You would then add a small line of code to a already existing python script that would execute the application and therefore send the email automatically. However, the other day I had my IT department upgrade my Microsoft Office suite from 32bit to 64bit and I can no longer send the email.

Negative 63960 pI have a java servlet application on Java 7 that is normally very healthy in terms of system resource consumption. Normally CPU usage on the server is below 50. However in the few minutes following startup it behaves much differently, to the point that the CPU can become pegged at 100 for several minutes if its trying to serve a lot of traffic during that period. The result is slow response times, network timeouts, and even long garbage collection pauses sometimes.p  pTo diagnose the issue, I took a series of thread dumps while the server was starting up and I ran top H at the same time. By matching each java thread to a pid, I can consistently see the codeC2 CompilerThreadcode using by far the most CPU. I have done research about what this thread does and I understand that it is a Java compiler optimizing code based on runtime statistics. But from all the reading Ive done, I cant tell the best approach to making the situation better. The only options I can glean arep  ol liSwitch from C2 to TieredCompiler but will this result in better performance in the first few minutes after startupli liTurn on XXPrintCompilation to see what is being optimized but what do I do with this information Can I force it to be optimized before the server is accepting traffic somehowli ol  pWhat is the best approach to take and are there other options to try and alleviate CPU usage after startupp

Negative 63960 pI am running a flute a protocol for sending multicast traffic applicationbinary which I downloaded from C program by popen.

Anybody know a good workaround  other than writing some dummy meta data into each post.p

Negative 63960 pI am working on a reaction game using Pygame and have run into a few difficulties with the timer. Currently how this code functions, is that when you start the program, you have to hit a for the countdown timer to start. As the letter appears on the screen you hit the corresponding keyboard key, which updates the score. The two things I would like to change have to do with the timer. I would like for the timer to autostart without having to hit the a button and I would like for the score to not continue to tally once the time has expired.p  pYou will see some of my previous attempts commented out.

Negative 63960 pI have a minor problem, and Im unsure how to fix the error.p  pBasically, I have two columns and I want to use a Double For Loop to calculate the averages between each number in both columns so it results in a vector of averages. To clarify, apply and mean functions isnt the best function because I need only half of the total possible combinations to obtain averages. For examplep  precodeCol1ltc1,2,3,4,5 Col2ltc1,2,3,4,5 Q1ltdata.framecbindCol1, Col2  Q1meanlt0 for i in 1lengthQ1Col1    for j in i1lengthQ1Col2      Q1mean[i]ltQ1Col1[i]Q1Col2[j]2     codepre  pBasically, for each number in Q1Col1, I want it average it with Q1Col2. The reason why I want to use a double for loop is to eliminate duplicates. This is the matrix version to provide visualizationp  precode1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5 5.0 codepre  pHere, each row represents a number from Q1Col1 and each column represents a number from Q1Col2. However, notice that there is redundancy on both sides of the matrix diagonal. So using the Double For Loop, I eliminate the redundancy to obtain the averages of the unique combination of cases. Using the matrix above, it should look like thisp  precode1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0     2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5         3.0 3.5 4.0             4.0 4.5                 5.0 codepre

Negative 63960 pI havent been able to find anywhere a simple example on how to plot a moment tensor to a png file. I have been reading this a hrefhttpdocs.obspy.orgpackagesobspy.imaging.html relnofollowobspy tensor example pageap  pThe simple example shows how to generate the tensor but none of them show how to just plot a simple tensor to a file. Also the parts that do show how to make it output stuff to a file do not refer to the tensor types of objects. If anyone could explain how to put the tensor, just the tensor  no axes no nothing else  into a png file i would appreciate it.p

It works fine the way it is but I think it could cause problems if I used more tiles on a slower computer.

That way Id only have to print one subsurface to the display oppose to x many objects.img srchttpi.stack.imgur.com3If5U.png altenter image description here This is how the screen looks. strongHow do I save the screen as a subsurfacestrongp

Negative 63960 pIm loading in a binary file into a memory stream and modifying the bytes and then storing the file to disk. However to save time I retain the modified byte array to calculate a checksum. When I load the saved file from disk and calculate the checksum the file length is about 150 bytes different from the original byte length when it was saved and obviously the checksum doesnt match the one before it was saved. Any ideas as to why this happens Ive searched and searched for clues but it looks like Id have to reload the file after it was saved to calculate an accurate checksum. p  pAlso note that the shorter byte array does render its contents correctly and so does the longer byte array, in fact the two arrays render identicallyp  pHeres the code that collects the modified bytes from the memory streamp  precodewriterStream.Flush storedFile  new Byte[writerStream.Length] writerStream.Position  0 writerStream.ReadstoredFile, 0, Convert.ToInt32writerStream.Length codepre  pAnd heres how I read the filep  precodeusing BinaryReader readFile  new BinaryReaderDelimon.Win32.IO.File.OpenfilePath, Delimon.Win32.IO.FileMode.Open                      byte[] cgmBytes  readFile.ReadBytesConvert.ToInt32readFile.BaseStream.Length             hash  fileCheck.ComputeHashcgmBytes                          codepre  pAnd heres how the file is savedp  precode     using BinaryWriter aWriter  new BinaryWriterDelimon.Win32.IO.File.CreatefilePath                  aWriter.WritestoredFile         codepre  pAny suggestions would be much appreciated.p  pThxp

Negative 63960 pIve created a text based game which automatically generates a map with 10x10 rooms, a few of the rooms are blocked by various debris and I couldnt work out the most efficient way to check if a player can still reach a key and get to the exit without them being cut off from the map.p  pCurrently theres a low chance needed rooms are cut off from the rest of the map, making the level impossible, I thought about checking each adjacent square to the start position, and then repeat and repeat until all of the squares that are accessible are set to accessible in a variable and then if the three objects arent reachable just regening the map again until they are. This may be slow if it regens a few times though.p  pDoes anyone have any thoughts on the repetitive part to keep it fast, or a better way of achieving thisp  pHeres an image of a generated map s are blocked rooms. a hrefhttppostimg.orgimage8oo88jxgb relnofollowhttppostimg.orgimage8oo88jxgbap

Negative 63960 pHi I want to see an example tech stack where vowpal wabbit is used.p  pThis can be actual application which people are using or an imaginary one which illustrates how VW fits.p  pWe are currently facing a common legacy code problem. Our back end is a collection of web services implemented in C using relational DB and Front end is Javascript based web app build on top of those webservices.  p  pNow We want to extend our backend to provide some analytics services which uses machine learning functionality. Having seen around, I quite liked Apache Spark  ML  GraphX as graph already heavily features in our server logic. But the problem is they are not C. Though they can be made to integrate with it, but as we will be writing lot of our own stuff, We will have to write nonCJavascript code, which is currently not under consideration. p  pVowpal Wabbit is another candidate that meets our criteria but I am not sure how it would fit overall right from rawdata storage to application logic. Hence the question.p

The first way is for free, and the second is not and depend of the neighborhood of the shipments destination, the cost is different.p  pRight now, i have a show cart page, which has a Place the order button, that takes you to a page where you can select if you want to having it shipped to an address, or if you want to take it from 2 address i have set.p  pThe problem is that i dont know how can i manage the models and controllers for the shipping or taking, and i dont know how can i do a multistep form the first one you check which products you want to order, then you select if you want to pick the item or you want it to be shipped to you, the webapp shows you the total price, and then you confirm or not.p  pI would like you to help me with the shipping or picking model. And i would really appreciate some advices about the multistep form.p
Negative 63960 pIve got a projects, for an embedded STM32.p  pIve got some code strategy used to determinate where the robot should be going. The strategy uses a pathfinding library.p  pThe latter can use SDL for debugging and its cool  . It uses a USESDL flag to include or not the sdl source files and compile without the SDL gcc flags.p  pFor now I create a .a archive file, containing the pathfinding library, to be linked later with the strategy object files. It works fine without SDL.p  pI want the strategy project to be COMPLETELY independent from SDL, even in the makefile. So id like to link the SDL libraries INSIDE the .a file, and then link it with the strategy files.p  pHow can I link the SDL with the pathfinding library, without having to know it in the strategy filesmakefile p  pThanks p
Negative 63960 pI have a controller where users entries are saved and can be updated by admin. There is an index page which shows the saved and existing entries, a show page which shows the individual entry and an edit page where the entry can be updated. What i am trying to do now is on the index page. I want the entries here to each have a checkbox where the admin can select which ones of these to archive. For now as it is merely just a case of archiving these entries in the sense of being able to clear up the index view i do not want to have a separate archive controller etc but do this within my diagnostics controller as a way to clear up the index view as i have said and nothing needs to be further done with the archived entries at this stage anyway. I followed the rails cast on checkboxes and lists but this did not work for me and i got a MongoidErrorsDocumentNotFound error. Therefore i have this code still in my view and controller but at this point i have commented it out. I went along the lines of creating a custom route but i think this may have ben where my problems came from as this did not seem to work. I am also trying to use TDD and Capybara for this. If anyone can suggest what i should be doing next it would be much appreciated. I can get the checkboxes and save button to appear but from the controller point of view and the routes i seem to have hit a wall herep  pstrongindexstrongp  precodeh1 Diagnostics  table   tr     th     th User     th Message     th Device     th RELSMobile Version     th Submitted     th Archive    diagnostics.each do diagnostic     tr       td         strong linkto show, admindiagnosticpathdiagnostic       td          if diagnostic.user            linkto diagnostic.user.email, [admin, diagnostic.user]          else           unknown       td          diagnostic.data[message]       td         pre JSON.prettygeneratediagnostic.data[device]       td          diagnostic.data[appVersion]       td          diagnostic.updatedat       td           checkboxtag A Checkbox, method put, data  confirm Are you sure     formtag admindiagnosticsidcomplete, method gt put do     fieldsettag do       checkboxtag diagnosticid, diagnosticids[], method put, data  confirm Are you sure        submittag Mark as Complete   submittag Save, method put, data  confirm Are you sure   paginate diagnostics codepre  pstrongControllerstrongp  precodeclass AdminDiagnosticsController lt AdminBaseController   beforefilter diagnostic, except gt [index]    def index     diagnostics  DiagnosticInfo.all.orderbycreatedat.desc.pageparams[page].per50   end    def show     respondto do format       format.html       format.json  render json diagnostic      end   end    def update     if diagnostic.updateattributesparams[diagnosticinfo]       redirectto admindiagnosticpath, notice Successfully updated.     else       render action edit     end   end    def edit   end    def destroy     diagnostic.destroy     redirectto admindiagnosticspath   end     def complete     DiagnosticInfo.updateall[Archive, Time.now], id gt params[diagnosticids]     params[diagnosticids]      redirectto admindiagnosticspath    end    private    def diagnostic     diagnostic  DiagnosticInfo.findparams[id]   end end codepre  pstrongroutesstrongrelevant partp  precoderesources diagnostics     member do      put complete    end  end codepre  pstrongfeaturesspec relevant partstrongp  precode  it can archive a diagnostic report do      diagnosticinfo  FG.creatediagnosticinfo     visit admindiagnosticspath     page.should havecontenttest message      saveandopenpagelaunchy     clickbutton Save     checkA Checkbox   end codepre  pstrongModelstrongp  precodeclass DiagnosticInfo   include MongoidDocument   include MongoidTimestamps    field data, type Hash   field userid, type Integer   field notes, type String   validates data, presence true   archived     index createdat 1    def user     user  User.whereauthsystemuserid self.userid.first   end end codepre

Negative 63960 pone problem is really bugging me.p  pI have a webshop with global customer scope, so I am using the known service maxcdn.com with a pullzone to share my images, scripts and similar resources via maxcdn.p  pMaxcdn gives me a subdomain with that I can access my resources and if I enable sharedssl which I did for my cartcheckout which is SSLsecured I get a slightly different subdomain from them that supports ssl.p  pI replaced all resources via PHP with wether the nonssl or ssl variant depending on what the current sites protocol is.p  pOn my own PC this construct works pretty well. However at some colleagues different location, but same behaviour on all PCs, devices it tells me the SSL certificate is not valid and it cannot open the page at all with all browsers.p  pIt says the SSL certificate would be invalid and it shows the certificate of maxcdn would not be compatible with my own pages domain.p  p To cut long story shortp  pIm using my own sslcertificate to fetch the website from the webserver and use the maxcdn sslcertificate to fetch resources such as images and css, javascripts to fetch resources from the CDN.p  pIs this a setup that should work out of the box, or does the maxcdn certificate needs to be registered in the apache or how can this happen.p  pAnyone got an idea Thanks so far...p

Negative 63960 pWhen setting up a server socket in Python, the codesocket.bindaddresscode method allows you to specify the address as a tuple like codehost, portcode. However, a hrefhttpsdocs.python.org2librarysocket.htmlexample relnofollowthe first examplea shows that you can specify the host as codecode as a shortcut to mean all interfaces IPv4.p  pI can see how it could be useful to limit which interfaces a server socket listens on for the purposes of security. However, is there any other reason why youd want to specify a hostIP addressp  pThe reason for me asking is that I maintain a debugger interface written in Python. Someone has asked me why I dont just use codecode as the host, so that remote clients can connect without any config change. This doesnt feel right somehow, but felt like a more technical explanation would be necessaryp  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 63960 pIve been fiddling with SceneKit recently and I wanted to make the following thingp  pWhen creating a Game template from Xcode, you get a scene with a ship.  I wanted to animate this ship and orient it according to the relative position of my iPhone after I tap the screen. So for instance, if I hold my iPhone horizontally, tap the screen, this takes the reference attitude of my horizontal iPhone. Then, when I lift it changing the pitch, I want the ship to orient itself as such.p  pIve been trying to change my ship node eulerAngles with the attitude pitch yaw and roll as in the followingp  precodeCMAttitude  attitude  deviceMotion.attitude ship.eulerAngles  SCNVector3Makeattitude.pitch, attitude.yaw, attitude.roll codepre  pWhenever I do that, the ship goes back to its original position in the scene. I cant seem to understand how to give it a speed in the direction its facing without making it reset to its original position when I change its eulerAngles.p  pIdeally, the ship would have some sort of engine power accelerating it in the direction its facing, while it would still be affected by gravity. How should I do that Thanksp

Negative 63960 pIm doing research before I create my social network database and Ive found a lot of questionsresources pertaining to graph and keyvalue databases for social networks. I understand there are a TON of different options and ways to implement the DB. I also understand that what the big companies do is complex and way above what I currently need 1b users. I also know each of the big companies have revamped their databases to account for the insane scaling they go through. p  pBecause I dont know how the network will grow, and I dont believe I can accurately create a model that will scale to 1m users due to unknowns such as how people will use it, how often people post, comment, etc. But I can at least try to create a database that will be easiest to scale when if the need arises.p  pDo most companies create a database to handle up to 1k users, then once they grow, they revamp it for 10k users, then 100k, etc If they do, at each of these arbitrary numbers because of the unknowns listed above, do companies typically change a few tablesnodesetc, or do they completely recreate the database to take advantage of new technologies such as moving from SQL to graphp  pI want to pick the best solution, but Im finding the decision between graph, keyvalue, SQL, among others very difficultespecially with no data to know what relationshipsdata is most important. I believe I can create a solid system using a graph that can support up to 10k users, but Im worried having to potentially completely reacreate the database as the system grows. Is this a worry now to avoid issues, or implement now and adapt later type problemp  pGoing further, if I do need to plan on complete DB restructures, does it typically make sense to use a MultiModel NoSQL DBMS such as OrientDB or ArangoDBp

Negative 63960 pI am using Spring Boot 1.2.5 and want to do some JUnit4 testing. I have an Eclipse project that contains the test. During initializiation a temporay H2 database is created.

No code from my side, just the XML in the resources folder. This runs without any problems. Then I found that in the test three of the five tables are empty. The schema still exists, but not data. p  pI then changed to manual creation of the H2 databasedatasource bean and in the same method I checked if all records are present.

Negative 63960 pIve noticed a very weird behavior of my app. The app is quite complex, it has 30 View Controllers and while working with ones having either a collection or a table view they rarely stop being responsive. I have to press Home button and wake it up again to make the interface be working. p  pThe thing is, the app uses REST API for downloading data from the web server and Realm for a persistent storage. When I select a cell in one collection the app shows a new view controller and it also loads data from the web on codeviewDidLoadcode method in an async main queue to not block the main UI stuff. p  pI thought it could be an issue of strongThread Deadlockstrong. But I dont see any explicit signs looking through the code. Also I have duplicates of scenes in the Storyboard because of the Slide Menu. So generally controllers are pushed to the navigation stack via performing an appropriate segue but for strongMenuTableViewControllerstrong I instantiate view controllers manually with their identifiers the UI differs in some way so I use 2 different scenes. Dunno if it can be useful. p  pP.S. There is no issues with alphas, transparent views preventing from registering the gestures. After either reloading i.e. kill and run again or reopening i.e. press home button and make it active again the app shows the destination view controller.  p  pP.S.S. Swift 1.2 and iOS 8. Tested on iPhone 6 Plus. Repeats not so often. p  pIf you have an idea what could go wrong please let me know  p

Negative 63960 pOn one worksheet I have 4 cells e.g., A1 through A4 that can each contain one of a handful of text options e.g., red, blue, green, or yellow. So on one worksheet these four cells may be filled in as A1Red, A2Green, A3Red, A4Red.p  pOn a second worksheet, I want to fill in a single cell with the types of color chosen for those four cells. In the given example, this cell on the second worksheet would read RedGreen.p  pIm looking for a formula I can put into the cell on the second sheet that will check the four cells and pull only one of each that contains a unique text. Is there a formula that would, for example, copy A1, then copy A2 only if it is different from A1, then copy A3 only if it is different from both A1 and A2, then copy A4 only if it is different from A1, A2, and A3p  pI hope that made sense.

However, I dont think the setTimeout is working as even when I increase it to 5000 or 10000, the action is performed instantaneously and no delay takes place at least certainly nothing close to 510 seconds.p  pIve also tried putting the functions inside code.postcodes success callbackp  precode    ...     if delSigCheck ampamp addInsCheck          .postaddDelSigUrl, function              setTimeoutfunction                  .postaddInsUrl, function                      setTimeoutfunction                          originalCheckout                     , 1300                              , 1300               else if ... codepre  pAnd finally Ive also triedp  precode.when.postaddDelSigUrl.thenoriginalCheckout codepre  pas well as code.donecode and codesuccesscode but none of it works, and the .postss load in an unexpected order, failing.p  h2The Questionh2  ol liWhat am I doing wrongli liHow can I make it so 1 loads fully, then 2 loads fully, and only then 3 fires and loadsli ol  h2UPDATE 1h2  pI just tried a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma321611824206306jfriend00s answerap  precode            .postaddDelSigUrl,  cache false .thenfunctiondata1                  CONSOLE.LOGing HERE                 console.logdata1                 return .postaddInsUrl,  cache false              .thenfunctiondata2                  CONSOLE.LOGing HERE                 console.logdata2                 return originalCheckout              codepre  pBut it still resulted inp  precodeXHR finished loading POST cart.phpactionaddampproductid1280.

Negative 63960 pIn my application, I display a MKMapView which I have created using a storyboard. I have tried toggling the rotateEnabled boolean member of MKMapView, both via storyboard and programatically. It works, but only after some user interaction has occured. That is, the application will load the mapview and rotation will occur, until the user scrolls in any direction. At that point, the rotation will cease and the map locks into place. Is this behavior just an unpreventable part of the MKMapView class or can it be preventedp

Negative 63960 pI have created a fully functioning chess game with pygame in python. The only current onscreen options I have are the reset button to reset the game board and the quit button, to quit the game. I want to create an option for the user to save and load a game at any time they like, so that it will store the piece positions and whose turn it is. Ive tried using the pickle module for this, but I cant seem to grasp how it works, or whether or not it will actually work with pygame.  p
