Positive 904 pIm am trying to use tablesorter to parse json returned for a php POST request.p  pThe Post request returns the json successfully, however, the tablesorter doesnt function correctly.  From what I can tell, only the static table data is taking the tablesorter. The tablesorter is not being applied to the returned JSON data that is being formatted into the table rows.p  pSo basically, what I get is a the filter functionality on the header values that are manually placed in the HTML body.  I believe that this is happening because the returned json is not in the DOM when tablesorter is being applied to the table.  I thought that placing the tablesorter code after the Jquery php post request would fix this, but still not working.p  pIf the problem tablesorter wont work on the returned data, is my only option then to construct the table in the php, and then return the completed table to the page with a php postp  precode.when.post..phploadjson.php,path dir.done     functiondata     var obj  jQuery.parseJSONdata     var html       forvar i  0 i lt obj.length i         html  lttrgtlttdgt  obj[i].vala lttdgtlttdgt  obj[i].valb lttdgtlttdgt  obj[i].valc lttdgtlttdgt  obj[i].vald lttdgtlttdgt  obj[i].vale lttdgtlttrgt   mytable tbody.first.afterhtml                          mytable      .tablesorter     theme blue,     headerTemplate  content icon,     widthFixed true,     widgets [zebra, filter]         lthtmlgtltbodygt     lttable idmytable classtablesortergt     lttheadgtlttrgt     ltthgtvalaltthgt     ltthgtvalbltthgt     ltthgtvalcltthgt     ltthgtvaldltthgt     ltthgtvaleltthgt     lttrgtlttheadgt     lttbodygt     lttbodygt         lttablegt ltbodygtlthtmlgt codepre

Positive 904 pFollowing situation I have a form with mostly  dropdown lists which I populate from a database. Theres also a text input field. The form is sent via POST. What Im wondering is, is it really necessary to sanitize the POST variables besides the text input field, of course before putting them in an sql query After all, its not really user input if it came from a drop down list that I created. With GET I would understand the recommendation as it would be possible to manipulate the variables being sent. But AFAIK, thats not possible with POST.p

Positive 904 pI just realized  I have no idea how to POST an empty array from an HTML form to PHP. I can POST arrays of size 1 or larger, but is there any way to post an empty array I mean, like, you can havep  precodeltformgt   ltinput typehidden nameitems[0] valueValue Item 1 gt  ltinput typehidden nameitems[1] valueValue Item 2 gt ltformgt codepre  pwhich gives an array of size 2 codePOST[items]  [Value Item 1, Value Item 2]code but is there any way to pass an empty array as the value of a POST key That is, I know I can make codePOST[items]  code, but an empty array code[]codep  pThe specific use case is I have a one to many form, say like a shopping cart with items. The form is populated by existing items from the DB, but can add or delete items, which are in an array of items. The array of items is indexed  if new items are added, they are saved to the DB if items are deleted, they are removed from the array and deleted from the DB. p  pAll of which works fine  unless all the items are deleted from the form, in which case no item key is passed.p  pI found the perfectly good workaround, which is to put a hidden input items  null at the top of the form, so the key is passed even if there are no items, then in PHP if the items key is  I convert it to an empty array  so all works fine. I was just curious in theory if it was possible to POST an empty array. No idea why that is considered inappropriate  hope the explanation helps.p  pAs for why I want to check on the existence of the key  I use the same generic code to process inputs from different forms  so, if the user changes the address on the shopping cart without specifying the items, the items should not be deleted just because there is no items key.p  pTo clarify further, Im not actually building a Shopping Cart  Im building an abstract framework that supports mapping onetomany POSTs to Eloquent OneToMany relationships. Any field in a POST with an empty value is deleted from the Object  but any fieldkey NOT in the POST is NOT deleted or modified in the underlying DB. p  pPoint is, Im building a generic toolset  not just trying to get one function to handle one form.p  pThanks,p  pChrisp

Positive 904 pIm supposed to make an old sqlite database editable trough a Sketchup Plugin in its WebDialog. Sketchups Ruby is not able to install the sqlite3 gem and since I already need to display the table in a WebDialog, I opted for a micro service with the help of Nancy.

They even offer a codeConnectorcode that can send requests based on the actions of the user in the grid.p  pThey also offer a connector for the server side, but that emtooem does not work with sqlite. I already managed to connect to my database, used codeDappercode to bin the result of an SQL query to an object and return that data with a manually crafted JSON object.

Negative 904 pa hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiLiterateprogrammingLiterate programminga is a way of developing software where documentation comes first, then the coding. One writes the documentation of a code snippet, and then writes the implementation of the snippet.

However, due to the lack of tools the LP usage is limited in the company.

Heres my situationp  pstrongIngredientsstrongp  ul liA serviceable set of API objects representing entities, fields, and searches, which handles constructing a search, generating SQL, and returning the results.  So thats all taken care of.li liASP.NET 3.5li ul  pstrongDesired Interface Functionalitystrongp  p1 On initial page load, the interface gets a preconfigured Search object with a set of SearchCriterion objects.

If I could get the dynamically generated control collection to just play nice and stick in ViewState, I could examine the controls on postback, rebuild the Search object, then handle control events neatly.p  pstrongPossible Solutionsstrongp  ul lipI could make the Search object serializable and store it in viewstate.  Then on page load I could grab it and reconstruct the control collection at page load time.  However Im not sure if this would play nicely with controls raising events, and what happens to the viewstate of Dropdown lists that contain data from the database  could I get it back  Its highly undesirable for me to have to requery the database on every postback.pli lipI could develop a custom server control a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryzt27tfhy.aspxsee this linka for this kind of thing... but that is a new topic for me and would involve some learning, plus Im not totally sure if a custom server control would work any more nicely with nonfixed control collections.  Anybody know about thatpli lipI was thinking that I might be able to accomplish this using databound controls  for example I could bind my criterion collection to a repeater which has a fixed control collection maybe hide the nonused value controls, use an inner repeater for the Field dropdown lists.  Then all the information would stay in ViewState... rightpli lipAny new ideas would be greatly appreciated.pli ul  pthanks for your help. b.Fandangop
Negative 904 pI once saw a programming pattern not design, how to implement a fast copy of buffers. It included an interleaved loop and switch.

Negative 904 pI got stuck in the problem beneath, because I dont use Access or Excel much and I have some basic programming language.  So heres the dealp  pI just made a fairly simple database in MS Access 2007 with a nice query to retrieve data, depending on which parameters you pass. In Excel 2007, I have this big template which basically has parameters for the query. These parameters change per column amp per rowp  pPerhaps superfluously, e.g.p  precodecolumn A contains paramA 10 different options column B contains paramB 8 different options column C contains paramC 2 different options codepre  pWhat Id like to do is to fill this template with dynamic data from Access, minding the continously changing parameters. e.g.p  precodecolumn D contains Query ParamA, ParamB, ParamC codepre  pBest way to go I think is to make a inline function that retrieves results from the query, also passing the parameters depending on the relative cell position. And this function is then copied as a normal inline excel function like emSUMem.p  pI just dont know how to call execute an MS Access query from inside an Excel Macro function.p  pCould someone help me with it Thank you very much in advancep

Negative 904 pIm working on my first Core Data project on iPhone and am really liking it. Core Data is cool stuff. p  pI am, however, running into a design difficulty that Im not sure how to solve, although I imagine its a fairly common situation. It concerns the data model. p  pFor the sake of clarity, Ill use an imaginary football game app as an example to illustrate my question. Say that there are NSMOs called Downs and Plays. Plays function like templates to be used by Downs. The user creates Plays for example, Bootleg, Button Hook, Slant Route, Sweep, etc. and fills in the various properties. Plays have a tomany relationship with Downs. For each Down, the user decides which Play to use. When the Down is executed, it uses the Play as its template. After each down is run, it is stored in history. The program remembers all the Downs ever played.p  pSo far, so good. This is all working fine. p  pThe question I have concerns what happens when the user wants to change the details of a Play. Lets say it originally involved a pass to the left, but the user now wants it to be a pass to the right. Making that change, however, not only affects all the future executions of that Play, embut also changes the details of the Plays stored in historyem. The record of Downs gets polluted, in effect, because the Play template has been changed. p  pI have been rolling around several possible fixes to this situation, but I imagine the geniuses of SO know much more about how to handle this than I do. Still, the potential fixes Ive come up with arep  p1 Versioning of Plays. Each change to a Play template actually creates a new, separate Play object with the same name as far as the user can tell. Underneath the hood, however, it is actually a different Play. This would work, AFAICT, but seems like it could potentially lead to a wild proliferation of Play objects, esp. if the user keeps switching back and forth between several versions of the same Play creating object after object each time the user switches. Yes, the app could check for preexisting, identical Plays, but... it just seems like a mess. p  p2 Have Downs, upon saving, record the details of the Play they used, but not as a Play object. This just seems ridiculous, given that the Play object is emthereem to hold those just those details.p  p3 Recognize that Play objects are actually fulfilling 2 functions one to be a template for a Down, and the other to record what template was used. These 2 functions have a different relationship with a Down. The first template has a tomany relationship. But the second record has a onetoone relationship. This would mean creating a second object, something like PlayTemplate which would retain the tomany relationship with Downs. Play objects would get reconfigured to have a emonetooneem relationship with Downs. A Down would use a PlayTemplate object for execution, but use the new kind of Play object to store what template was used. It is this change from a tomany relationship to a onetoone relationship that represents the crux of the problem. p  pEven writing this question out has helped me get clearer. I think something like solution 3 is the answer. However if anyone has a better idea or even just a confirmation that Im on the right track, that would be helpful. Remember, Im not really making a football game, its just fastereasier to use a metaphor everyone understands. p  pThanks. p

Negative 904 pI have a nested GridView that is placed inside a ListView. The GridView renders perfectly fine with all the entities that are bound inside its datasource.p  pEach record in my gridview has two buttons  delete and edit. The issue that I am having is that the methods wired to each of these buttons never get fired.p  pI think the reason for this behaviour is because my ListViews data binding happens only on the first page load, and not on every subsequent postback. As a result, when a postback happens, the events of the nested gridview are never wired up again  hence my methods are not getting fired.p  pHere is what my code [simplified] looks likep  precodeltaspListView IDuiListView ... runatservergt     ltLayoutTemplategt         ...     ltLayoutTemplategt     ltItemTemplategt         ...         ltaspGridView IDuiGridView                       OnRowDataBounduiGridViewRowDataBound                     OnRowEditinguiGridViewRowEditing                     OnRowDeletinguiGridViewRowDeleting runatservergt             ltColumnsgt                 ...                 ltaspTemplateFieldgt                     ltItemTemplategt                         ltaspButton IDuiEditRowButton CausesValidationfalse CommandNameEdit TextEdit runatserver gt                         ltaspButton IDuiRemoveRowButton CausesValidationfalse CommandNameDelete TextRemove runatserver gt                     ltItemTemplategt                 ltaspTemplateFieldgt             ltColumnsgt         ltaspGridViewgt         ...     ltItemTemplategt ltaspListViewgt codepre  pCode Behindp  precodeprotected void PageLoadobject sender, EventArgs e      if IsPostBack          uiListView.ItemDataBound  new EventHandlerltListViewItemEventArgsgtuiListViewItemDataBound         uiListView.DataSource  ...         uiListView.DataBind         Find a GridView and bind relevant data to it private void uiListViewItemDataBoundobject sender, ListViewItemEventArgs e      if e.Item.ItemType  ListViewItemType.DataItem          ListViewDataItem listViewDataItem  ListViewDataItem e.Item          GridView uiGridView  GridViewlistViewDataItem.FindControluiGridView         ...         uiGridView.DataSource  ...         uiGridView.DataBind         For every row being bound to GridView, register the edit and delete  buttons as postback controls protected void uiGridViewRowDataBoundobject sender, GridViewRowEventArgs e      if e.Row.RowType  DataControlRowType.DataRow              Control uiEditButton  e.Row.FindControluiEditRowButton         if uiEditButton  null              ScriptManager.GetCurrentPage.RegisterAsyncPostBackControluiEditButton                   Control uiRemoveRowButton  e.Row.FindControluiRemoveRowButton         if uiRemoveRowButton  null              ScriptManager.GetCurrentPage.RegisterAsyncPostBackControluiRemoveRowButton                  Method runs when a GridViews edit button is clicked protected void uiGridViewRowEditingobject sender, GridViewEditEventArgs e      Console.WriteLineEditing Row...

Negative 904 pThanks for reading and for your thoughts this is a hairy problem, so I thought Id share to see if it is actually a fair challenge for more seasoned developers than ourselves.p  pWere developing a web application for a corporate Microsoft Active Directory environment, and we use Windows Authentication provided by IIS to authenticate users for singlesignon, alongside Forms Authentication. I know IIS complains when both are enabled, but it works very well, and every site weve deployed at has had no weird quirks to work around  until now.p  pThe new site has shared machines, logged in permanently with a generic account that has readonly access to the applications they need to use. This means that we cant differentiate between users who should have different permissions to the application we need some way of prompting the user for authentication details.p  pFirst try was some serious googling nobody else in the world seemed to have our problem except for a few misguided souls who had asked questions into the ether and received no response.p  pAfter a bit of brainstorming and nutting out the way IISs authentication works, it seemed that the most straightforward way to approach the problem was to issue a code401 Unauthorizedcode in response to a user known to be a shared account. Initial tests here seemed fruitful, yielding successful changes of username inside the browser, however a prototype at the site did not prompt for credentials, and the browser kept the same account details. We also hit on the IEspecific javascriptp  precodedocument.execCommandClearAuthenticationCache codepre  pwhich, again, worked in the lab but not onsite. Further experiments with IE security settings onsite revealed that the browser would automatically reauthenticate if the webapp site was excluded from the Intranet Zone, regardless of the method used to trick the browser into prompting the user for new account details.p  pNow were stuck. Weve got workaround options for getting it going on time, but theyre definitely not the right answersp  ul lirequire users to log out of the shared account before logging into our app ...yuckli liexclude our webapp from Intranet Zone on all machinesli liprovide a nonSSO login service for usersli ul  pIm convinced that theres a canonical way to do this  a known pattern, a common base problem thats already been solved, something like that  and Im very interested to hear what sort of inventive methods there are to solve this sort of problem, and if anyone else has actually ever experienced anything remotely like it.p

Negative 904 pNote to other potential contributors Please dont hesitate to use abstract or mathematical notations to make your point. If I find your answer unclear, I will ask for elucidation, but otherwise feel free to express yourself in a comfortable fashion.p  pTo be clear I am emnotem looking for a safe codeheadcode, nor is the choice of codeheadcode in particular exceptionally meaningful. The meat of the question follows the discussion of codeheadcode and codeheadcode, which serve to provide context.p  pIve been hacking away with Haskell for a few months now to the point that it has become my main language, but I am admittedly not wellinformed about some of the more advanced concepts nor the details of the languages philosophy though I am more than willing to learn. My question then is not so much a technical one unless it is and I just dont realize it as it is one of philosophy.p  pFor this example, I am speaking of codeheadcode.p  pAs I imagine youll know,p  precodePreludegt head []      Exception Prelude.head empty list codepre  pThis follows from codehead  [a] gt acode. Fair enough. Obviously one cannot return an element of handwavingly no type. But at the same time, it is simple if not trivial to define p  precodehead  [a] gt Maybe a head []      Nothing head xxs  Just x codepre  pIve seen some little discussion of this a hrefhttpbook.realworldhaskell.orgreadfunctionalprogramming.htmlherea in the comment section of certain statements. Notably, one Alex Stangl says p  blockquote   pThere are good reasons not to make everything safe and to throw exceptions when preconditions are violated.p blockquote  pI do not necessarily question this assertion, but I am curious as to what these good reasons are.p  pAdditionally, a Paul Johnson says, p  blockquote   pFor instance you could define safeHead  [a]  Maybe a, but now instead of either handling an empty list or proving it cant happen, you have to handle Nothing or prove it cant happen.p blockquote  pThe tone that I read from that comment suggests that this is a notable increase in difficultycomplexitysomething, but I am not sure that I grasp what hes putting out there.p  pOne Steven Pruzina says in 2011, no less, p  blockquote   pTheres a deeper reason why e.g head cant be crashproof. To be polymorphic yet handle an empty list, head must always return a variable of the type which is absent from any particular empty list. It would be Delphic if Haskell could do that....p blockquote  pIs polymorphism lost by allowing empty list handling If so, how so, and why Are there particular cases which would make this obvious strongThis section amply answered by Russell OConnor.strong Any further thoughts are, of course, appreciated.p  pIll edit this as clarity and suggestion dictates. Any thoughts, papers, etc., you can provide will be most appreciated.p

If a horizontal scroll bar is needed the headers of the tables are transformed and some t tokens are prepended and appended to the headers innerHTML. Thus the excel export shifts the headers in the excel file to the right, for each t 1 column. Do you have an idea how to get rid of that and solve the problemp  pWould be highly appreciated, thanksp

Negative 904 pIm currently in the process of writing an application that has quite a number of mathematically calculations in it. In some situations, these calculations need to be done quickly and we can deal with a small amount of precision loss to get the maths done as fast as possible. On the other hand, sometimes we require that the calculations be done very precisely and there are use cases for in between, where we would implement our own way of doing multiplicationdivisionadditionsubtractionpower etc that is more precise that float  float or double  double, I am aware that float is a bad choice, but faster than BigDecimal.multiplyBigDecimal... or even something like apfloat rather than BigDecimal.p  pAre there any existing libraries that allow an abstraction of such number formats, so that different ways of doing the maths are abstracted away, or do I have to create my ownp  pIve started coding up something, which seems to be working emokayem, but it would be far better to have a nicely tested library rather than reinventing the wheel I think.p  pstrongEDITED to clarify the situation with content from a comment belowstrongp  pThe problem is that BigDecimal is significantly slower than double  double etc. We need to be able to switch between precision and speed. The reasoning behind this is that we need to be able to run fast tests for debugging and cross checks with real world data which does not need to be perfectly accurate, but the final simulation which will often take days to weeks unacceptable for debugging will require high precision. Thus the need to be able to switch at will.p

All such differences from both the files need to be listed out on the console with layman understandable format.p  pI want to just explain it with an example to make it more clear.p  pMy first file if it looks like belowp  pre col1col2col3col4col5col6 1234ramyakrishna4567ramya.krishnaworse.com228802worse 1235Chandan4567chandan.kumarworse.com228862worse 1236Kacitha4567kacitha.mishraworse.com228872worse 1238Shajin4567shajin.maheshworse.com228873worse pre  pMy second file looks like thisp  pre col1col2col3col4col5col6 1234ramyakrishna4567ramya.krishnagood.com228802good 1235Chandan4567chandan.kumarworse.com228789worse 1236Kacitha4567kacitha.mishraworse.com228872worse pre  pSo when i compare both the files. We see that there is a difference in codecol4code and codecol6code in coderow2code. So I want something like thisp  pre 1234ramyakrishna4567ramya.krishnagood.com228802good COL4EXPECTEDramya.krishnaworse.comCOL6EXPECTEDworse pre  pSo in above row from second file should be printed. Then expected values should be printed.p  pI know files need to be sorted before using any script.p  hr  pFor fges script i am getting ouput like belowp  pI am getting ouput like below                                            p  pre perl diff.perl      Line 1 different value for column 38 was g, expected w Line 1 different value for column 40 was o, expected r Line 1 different value for column 41 was d, expected s Line 1 different value for column 42 was ., expected e Line 1 different value for column 43 was c, expected .

Negative 904 pIm setting up an OpenID provider using DotNetOpenAuth and Im stuck.p  pIt seems that OpenID requires that the user provides his OpenID URL first, and then the consumer would redirect him to the provider, giving the URL as a parameter checkidsetup mode.p  pBut with google, and some other providers, it works differently. You are just redirected to a generic page where you would either sign in, or select one of the accounts youre already logged in with. Or just redirected back if youre logged in with a single account.p  pIs this somehow related to the checkidimmediate mode If so, please give me a link to an article explaining how that works.p

Negative 904 pIs it normal for WPF applications to fail silently, even in debug mode Currently I am executing code in the richtextbox text changed event, and if it errors it simply stops calling the text changed event and so I have to step through all the code to find the point at which it stops...p  pAs an example, I was casting a class to another class, but I was casting to the wrong class typed it wrong.. and so the result was NULL. This resulted in some code directly after failing when I tried to use the class.

Negative 904 pI am writing a network server in C .NET 4.0. There is a network TCPIP connection over which I can receive complete XML elements. They arrive regularly and I need to process them immediately. Each XML element is a complete XML document in itself, so it has an opening element, several subnodes and a closing element. There is no single root element for the entire stream. So when I open the connection, what I get is like thisp  precodeltstatusgt     ltxgt123ltxgt     ltygt456ltygt ltstatusgt codepre  pThen some time later it continuesp  precodeltstatusgt     ltxgt234ltxgt     ltygt567ltygt ltstatusgt codepre  pAnd so on. I need a way to read the complete XML string until a status element is complete. I dont want to do that with plain text reading methods because I dont know in what formatting the data arrives. I can in no way wait until the entire stream is finished, as is often described elsewhere. I have tried using the XmlReader class but its documentation is weird, the methods dont work out, the first element is lost and after sending the second element, an XmlException occurs because there are two root elements.p

Negative 904 pI am looking for a way to hide one item in an Android spinner widget. This would allow you to simulate a spinner with no items selected, and ensures that the onItemSelected callback is always called for every item selected if the hidden item is the current one. Normally there is always one item in the spinner that doesnt generate a callback, namely the current one. p  pThere is some code on stackoverflow for how to disable gray out items, but not how to hide items completely as if they dont exist.p  pAfter much experimentation Ive come up with a somewhat hackish solution that works on various old and new Android platforms. It has some minor cosmetic drawbacks which are hard to notice. Id still like to hear of a more official solution, other than dont do that with a spinner. p  pThis always hides the first item in the spinner, but could fairly easily be extended to hide an arbitrary item or more than one item.

Negative 904 pI am very new to Quartz and I have some doubts about the jobs lifecycle.p  pLets suppose I have a single job configured to do some stuff.p  pThe job fires and ends its work.

But I cant deploy it to my AppEngine server to try it out Its my first time using AppEngine too.p  pCould you give me some steps to create my own GCM serverp  pSorry about my bad english.p  pThanksp
Negative 904 pOk so complete rewrite of the question due to lack of replies. I want a window that is dragable but as its being dragged, alter the margin to extend as far as the old position of the window. I.e. Window moves right X, extend margin left X. Now Ive hit a few snags such as the window having its edges cut off for some reason. Heres my code, let me know if you can spot anythingp  precodeprivate void WindowLocationChangedobject sender, EventArgs e                      double TmpLeft  Math.Absthis.Left  WinLeft             double TmpTop  Math.Absthis.Top  WinTop          if this.IsLoaded         depending on whether the window is moved left, right             if this.Left gt WinLeft             depending on whether the window is moved up, down                 if this.Top gt WinTop                     bdr.Margin  new ThicknessTmpLeft, TmpTop, 0, 0                 else                     bdr.Margin  new ThicknessTmpLeft, 0, 0, TmpTop                          else                              if this.Top gt WinTop                     bdr.Margin  new Thickness0, TmpTop, TmpLeft 40, 0                 else                     bdr.Margin  new Thickness0, 0, TmpLeft, TmpTop                             private void WindowLoadedobject sender, RoutedEventArgs e                      WinLeft  this.Left             WinTop  this.Top             bdr.Height  this.ActualHeightI set these because they are auto             bdr.Width  this.ActualWidth  before the window opens          codepre  pAt the moment the whole window set window background to yellow so I can see the margin is moving, where as I want the top left corner of the margin to remain in place. Ive also noticed that the area I click on to drag the window a codebordercode tends to move around as well so is no longer under my click as I move the window. Hope thats clear, comment any further questions.p  pstrongOLD  ONLY READ TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IM TRYING TO DOstrongp  pSo Im trying to create an application that has a pop up window with a pointerline coming from the child window to a particular place in the parent window. I achieved this like sop  precodeltBorder Namebrdr Margin40,0,0,0 gt     Content ltBordergt  ltLine         NamePointer         X10         X240         Y155         Y250         StrokeThickness2         StrokeBlack gtltLinegt codepre  pNotice the 40 left codeMargincode on the border that makes the window larger than it appears so that the codePolygoncode sticks out to the left and points to the parent window If theres a bettercoolermore elegant way of doing this, Im all ears. p  pSo that worked fine but now I want the pointer to be dynamic. As in, if the child window gets dragged the pointer must scale relatively to the parent windows location. I.e. it must appear as if the two windows are attached via the line. Now my plan was to record the point the child window opens on because it opens relative to the parent window, its correct when it initialises and then use the difference between this and the new location point after dragging to find the new points that the line should be going to. My code probably says it better than I ever could...p  precode    private void WindowLocationChangedobject sender, EventArgs e              if this.IsLoaded                      brdr.Margin  new ThicknessMath.Absthis.Left  WinLeft  40, Math.Absthis.Top  WinTop, 0, 0             Pointer.X1  Math.Absthis.Left  WinLeft             Pointer.Y1  Math.Absthis.Top  WinTop  55             Pointer.X2  Math.Absthis.Left  WinLeft  40             Pointer.Y2  Math.Absthis.Top  WinTop  50                    private void WindowLoadedobject sender, RoutedEventArgs e              WinLeft  this.Left         WinTop  this.Top      codepre  pAs you can see I have to set the window margin so that it extends to the old position. Then I reset the codeLinecode coords to the new values. All these values are calculated, like I said, by comparing the opening window coords to the current coords.p  pMy problem is, this isnt right. Would be very impressed to see someone able to figure this out.p

Negative 904 pI have a WCF Web Service that has no concurrency configuration in the web.config, so I believe it is running as the default as persession.  In the service, it uses a COBOL Virtual Machine to execute code that pulls data from COBOL Vision files.  Per the developer of the COBOL VM, it is a singleton.p  pWhen more than one person accesses the service at a time, Ill get periodic crashes of the web service.  What I believe is happening is that as one process is executing another separate process comes in at about the same time.  The first process ends and closes the VM down through normal closing procedures.  The second process is still executing and attempting to readwrite data, but the VM was shutdown and it crashes.  In the constructor for the web service, an instance of the VM is created and when a series of methods complete, the service is cleaned up and the VM closed out.p  pI have been reading up on Singleton concurrency in WCF web services and thinking I might need to switch to this instead.  This way I can open the COBOL VM and keep it alive forever and eliminate my code shutting down the VM in my methods.  The only data I need to share between requests is the status of the COBOL VM.p  pMy alternative Im thinking of is creating a server process that manages opening the VM and keeping it alive and allowing the web service to make readwrite requests through that process instead.p  pDoes this sound like the right path  Im basically looking for a way to keep the Virtual Machine alive in a WCF web service situation and just keep executing code against it.  The COBOL VM system sends me back locking information on the readwrites which I can use to handle retries or waits against.p  pThanks, Martinp

Negative 904 pWhat I have is a bunch of categories and subcategories stored in Oracle.

When they select a category, the resulting table should pull all the items from the selected category, plus items in that categorys subcategories.

The categories list could possibly be hundreds of rows long with a very varied assortments of categorysubcategory relationships. Currently, there is a subcategory that is 6 levels deep.p  pMy question is how should I structure my query without endless if a category with a parent id of emwhateverem then query for items This cannot be the only way. Query for categories with parentid of selected categoryid, then query for categories with parentid of those categories that were found in the previous query, then repeat again with new results, then repeat again with new results, each time adding exponentially to the number of queries I would be handcodingp  pMy initial reaction was to do this Loop an array that was initially populated with the first parentid query. As it looped through, query for the parentid of each of the arrays items. If it found anything, add it to the currently looping array. Something like thisp  precodelt populate Inital parentid query array gt ltcfset newArray  ArrayNew1gt ltcfloop from1 to10 indexigt     ltcfset ArrayAppendnewArray,igt ltcfloopgt  lt if parentid is found for index, add to newArray gt ltcfloop arraynewArray indexigt     ltquery for parentid with igt     ltif successfulgt         ArrayAppendnewArray,everythingTheQueryFoundWithParentIdOfI     ltifgt ltcfloopgt codepre  pBut I found that appending to an array while in a loop is valid code, but doesnt actually increase the iterations of the loop.

I need to multiply the value provided by an online service with a value stored in codeUIColorcode. Correct way to extract the RGB components prior to iOS5, which finally introduced the method code[UIColor getRedgreenbluealpha]code, is to use codeCGColorGetComponentscode. I then multiply this color with the color fetched from the online service. This fails in case code[UIColor grayColor]code was used to generate the codeUIColorcode. Meaning, I need to convert the color from the greyscale colorspace into RGB. In this case, its easy. What about some other colorspace being provided Or what if in a theoretical future scenario I just want to process a single pixels colorp  pThere is a suggestion somewhere that I paint a pixel into a bitmap context and then read this pixel. Thats insane, and I hope it isnt the only way to do this.

The logic in the model should be free to carry on moving things around without having to wait to be nudged by the controller telling it that the views are ready for more updates.p  pMy plan is to create a queue of pending actionsrequiringanimation, and each time the model updates something which needs animating, just add it to the queue and let it carry on. Then I could pluck actions off the queue and animate them one at a time.p  pThis would also mean that I could use the model without any views at all, without having to write a separate controller that just keeps calling back into the model when objects are moved.p  pSo before I start working on my own solution for this, is there already code to handle this in Apples APIs It seems like it would be a common enough problem that there would be a standard method of handling it.p  pAlternatively, is there a better way to handle building chains of animations at runtime As opposed to simply hard coding them using the completion block.p

I want this list of array names. How can I do it. Could anyone please help. Thanks.p

Negative 904 pWe ran across a problem where we have to maintain a date field  and preferably persist its value  where the date field is dependent on other entities state. What is the correct way to address this problem with JPA2  Hibernate  Springp  pBasically, we have three entities, lets call them codeParentcode, codeChildcode, and codeConfcode. The codedependentDatecode is calculated by complex business rules that depend on other entities state. Specifically, it should be codeParentdatecode minus codeConfdelaycode skipping all days that are weekends or holidays persistent data.p  pThe problem is that whenever the codeParentdatecode changes, all the childrens codedependentDatecodes should be recalculated. This should happen also whenever the codeChildcode objects codeconfcode is changed. Currently, there is a service method for calculating the new date based on the codeChildcode objects relations lets call it codecalculateDatecode.p  pWe are faced with the problem of where the fields value should be calculated. I came up with three possible solutions. Which of these  or possibly something else  is the preferred way of updating entities fields that depend on other entities statep  ol liA JPA codeEntityListenercode ul lithis is discouraged in the JPA2 spec, since the EntityListeners should not access other entitiesli lithe field would always be correctli ulli liAn Spring AOP aspect that updates  ul lithe logic is hidden in some other class and is not easily seenli lia risk that the pointcut does not catch all persistupdate eventsli ulli liEvery developer for himself ul lialways, when updating an instance of either Parent or Child class, the developer must remember to call the services codecalculateDatecode methodli lishould this be in dao or service layerli lirisk of the developer forgetting to add the call, resulting in erroneous stateli ulli ol  pThe following example shows the entity relations with omitted annotation configuration.p  pstrongThe entitiesstrongp  precodepublic class Parent       LocalDate date      SetltChildgt children      onetomany   public class Conf       int delay   public class Child       LocalDate dependentDate      Conf conf                manytoone      Parent parent            manytoone  codepre

Negative 904 pIn my project I have created some network calls to the servlets in separate Thread where before that thread starts I show a spinner as wait progress. Until that network Thread finishes the waitprogress is displayed on to the screen and when I receive response from the server I have to explicitly call progress bars dispose method to dispose that progress bar. So, This is bit complicated whenever I make calls establishing GPRS connection while network strength goes down there I found sometimes it takes about 23 minutes to throw an IO Exception or receive response from server where I dispose waitprogress, show error message and proceed. I dont add any cancel command to waitprogress as network calls are made using separate thread so disposing waitprogress will allow user to make another call where the user is needed to wait until he gets response.p  pThe above scenario is complicated because the user will not be waiting for this long to get response. There must be some way that whenever I call network Thread and show progress bar the user should be able to cancel all the operations including network thread, go back to previous state and make another call if there is no or poor connectivity. p  pHere, I am using Lwuit. p

Negative 904 pI am working with a responsive web layout Ive diagrammed in the image below below.  Red areas are fixed on the screen, green areas are independently scrollable sections blue  scrollbars.  p  pimg srchttpi.imgur.comIUS85.png altlayoutp  pstrongIm wondering  is there any way without iframes to take the main content section of this layout the green area on the right and treat it as if it was the viewport itself so that the contents and styles would work as if it were its own independent full screenstrong  p  pThe reason Im trying to do this is because Id like it to strongbe as easy as possible to just fit a 2nd websites content straight into this main content section without having to adjust all of the pagesstrong to now fit into the narrower section of the site. p  pThe strong2nd site was built using twitter bootstrap for the scaffoldingstrong, and since the containers are all created relative to someones viewport size, they strongdo not fit neatly into the slightly narrower content areastrong given the left sidebar without having to adjust all of the scaffolding.  Id rather not have to adjust everything on many pages and therefore, Im looking for a hack to see if I can just make it fit crossing my fingers that something existsp  pIn addition, the strongleft sidebar is collapsiblestrong  so there would be a case where the main content section would take up the entire width of the viewport.  Hence, I would want it to dynamically adjust. p  pIt seems like I have 3 options p  ol liGo through each page of the 2nd site and strongrework all of the scaffolding in each pagestrong to ensure they work with a slightly narrower section, essentially treating the left sidebar as the first span column, and then adjusting the entirety of the site to work within the remaining width.  strongThis option doesnt really workstrong because if the sidebar is collapsed, then the main content area takes up the fullwidth and would now be narrower.li liUse iFrames  I am NOT considering this due to all of the implications.li listrongSomehow treat the main content area as its own viewport so that all of the scaffolding adjusts to whatever size it is, as if it were the viewport itself, or a full screen .strong li ol  pIs this possible somehowp  pIs there perhaps an alternative solution that might be even betterp  pThanksp
Negative 904 pI know people will complain that this has been asked before. The reason I am posting it is that I cannot see how mine is different, and it is not working. I have spent over 2 days looking at the other posts, but Im just not seeing it.p  pIntended behavior I want to launch the camera, take a photo, and return to my activity that launched it.p  pThe actual behavior The camera launches and allows me to take a photo, but then it only gives me the option to retake photo, cancel photo, and a check mark. When I press the check mark nothing happens. Its not frozen, but it just wont allow me to say yes I have taken the photo, return the results.p  pThe only way to get to my previous activity is to press back or cancel.

Negative 904 pI am having some purely cosmetic issues with wxPython. For instance the relationship between labels and the controls they represent  everything always appears to be at least 23 pixels off target and some times worse. In the dialogue Im currently creating I have changed the font of my text controls to Consolas and put them in a sizer with codewx.EXPANDcode. First of all, once I changed the font the text in the text controls got skewed a few pixels up, presumably because the font is a pixel or two smaller, and when I set codewx.EXPANDcode the text control grew a few pixels in height, making the skewing even worse.

Negative 904 pI have an article modelp  precodeclass Article lt ActiveRecordBase   attraccessible name, content end codepre  pI now want to add a beforesave createlinks callback that automatically subsitutes all words inside the article with links in case the word is also the name of another article. E.g. I have an article called Test and I create a new article with the content You can see a test here. I need an automatic link to the Test article between ther words a and here.p  pMy approach is to add in article.rbp  precodebeforesave createlinks  def createlinks   Article.all.each do article     unless self.name  article.name       self.content.gsubarticle.namei, lt linkto article.name, httplocalhost3000articlesarticle.id gt     end   end end codepre  pThe first unless line just to avoid articles linking to itself. This works fine for the first update action, but the seconds update subsitutes all linkto Test. etc... with linkto linkto etc.p  pSo I want to exclude that gsub substitutes all names that are between two characters which means its already substituted with a linkto Test. My approach isp  punless self.content  article.name  self.name  article.namep  pThis works too, in principle, but this leads to a result that as soon as one link is created no other links will be set anymore because as soon as one Test is found the whole gsub is skipped.p  pWhat is the best way to solve this Is there a regex for substitute all where self.content is article.name but only if article.name is without a  before the word In other words how do I add a character in a regex that should NOT be there Or is there a better way to resolve the whole issuep

Negative 904 pIm working with the Google Maps API and feel there is a better way to search through the panorama images other then a massive codeswitchcode statement. I would think that using an external hash table would be far more efficient and much easier to maintain. Each image has a unique codepanoIDcode, which I would be able to define. Reading up on hash tables, I believe I am correct in saying I could make a table and perfect function to get the data I need in constant time. Is there a good resource on how to build this I am not experienced with hashing at all.p  pMy logic goes as this Each image is saved in a directory as codesometextpanoID.jpgcode, where codesometextcode is a string and codepanoIDcode is anything I want it to be. When initializing the data in the aforementioned switch statement, all the switching is done according to the panoID and the other metadata is accessed there. For examplep  precodeswitchpanoID      case test1       links.push         description  TEST2,         pano  test2,         heading  70              break     case test2       links.push         description  TEST1,         pano  test1,         heading  125              links.push         description  TEST3,         pano  test3,         heading  0              break       case test3       links.push         description  TEST2,         pano  test2,         heading  0              break    codepre  pSince I will know all the codepanoIDcodes, and will have no need to sort, add, or otherwise change anything once the table is built, I feel there is a way to make a perfect hash but dont really know where to start. Any tips Thanks a bunch in advancep

Negative 904 pI have been experiencing a problem where an object that I am using in a cocos2D box2D project is overwritten with garbage.

This is very confusing because this code and the underlying class definition is more or less a copy of code from the SpaceViking project described in the Learning Cocos2D book.p  pIt occurred to me that perhaps the problem is that when I created the new project, I may have left the choice for Automatic Reference Counting selected, whereas I may not have done that for the SpaceViking project. I am currently using xcode 4.6 and cant figure out how to determine if ARC is being used in this project. I went to the build settings and searched for automatic reference counting, but could not find it.p  pHow can I determine if my project is using automatic reference countingp

Negative 904 pI need a way to process large binary data files efficiently, both in terms of memory and time.p  pI am working on a multithreaded Java application that processes large binary data files comprised of many data points that are manydimensional. The data points have the same dimension, and each point is about 100 kb. The number of data points is roughly 10,000 to 100,000. The data files are several gigabytes in the testing phase, but they will be many gigabytes in the future.p  pThe customer is running into memory problems when running the application, so I am working on a List of data points that decreases the memory required for processing while still providing good performance. p  pJava is a requirement of the project, and we constrained by the current memory on the clients system. The client system has many cores, but it is a shared system, and memory is the limiting factor right now.p  pThe set of data points is used repeatedly in our application. Sometimes the points are processed sequentially. At other times, subsets of the points, including all combinations of two distinct points, are processed. Within a subset, the points can be processed in any order, but points in a subset may be arbitrarily far apart. The data files are simple binary files I produce by parsing text data files and writing the values to a binary file. Currently, the data is doubleprecision, so I write the data points consecutively as a series of doubles to the binary data file. I parse each text file data point and write it immediately to the binary file, rather than keeping them all in memory. In the future we may process float, int, etc. data.p  pIve searched SO and other Internet sites. Ive tried several approaches so far, including reading points from the binary file as needed, but the performance has been poor compared to keeping the List of all data points in memory simultaneously. That works well for tests with smaller numbers of points of smaller dimensions, but the data sets for those tests are several orders of magnitude smaller than the real data sets. The approaches I have tried so far are hundreds or thousands of times slower than keeping all the points in memory.p  pI have experimented with direct ByteBuffers and MappedByteBuffers. The best approach is a class that I have extracted the relevant parts of below. It reads the binary data into an array of MappedByteBuffers. Then when a data point is requested through the getint index method below, the method loads the relevant buffer, reads the relevant bytes into a byte array, converts the bytes into a double array, and creates a DataPoint object. I used an array of MappedByteBuffers since there is no way the entire data file will fit into physical memory. I used an array of byte arrays so that the threads would have separate byte arrays to read the data into. Then I synchronized only on the actual access to the MappedByteBuffer, to minimize blocking. As I understand the Java Class Library, a Buffer is not threadssafe, though I read a post recently that claimed that MappedByteBuffers dont need to be synchronized.p  pAny feedback is welcome. In particular, I am curious about synchronization of the MappedByteBuffers.p  pThanksp  precodefinal static private int DOUBLEBYTESIZE  Double.SIZE  Byte.SIZE  public enum DataType    CHAR,   DOUBLE,   FLOAT,   INT,   LONG,   SHORT   final static private int numberOfBuffers  8 private MappedByteBuffer[] buffers  null private int bufferSize  1 private byte[][] readArray  null private DataType dataType private int sizeOfVector private int byteSizeOfVector private File binFile private int size  1  private int makeListFile binaryFile, DataType argDataType, int numberOfComponents    FileInputStream fis  null   FileChannel fc  null   try      dataType  argDataType     sizeOfVector  numberOfComponents     fis  new FileInputStreambinaryFile     fc  fis.getChannel     long fileSize  fc.size      switch dataType      case DOUBLE       byteSizeOfVector  DOUBLEBYTESIZE  sizeOfVector       break     default       break           size  int fileSize  byteSizeOfVector     bufferSize  size  numberOfBuffers     buffers  new MappedByteBuffer[numberOfBuffers]     long remaining  fileSize     long position  0     int bufferNumber  0     whileremaining gt 0        long length  Math.minremaining, bufferSize  byteSizeOfVector       buffers[bufferNumber]  fc.mapMapMode.READONLY, position, length       position  length          remaining  length       bufferNumber          readArray  new byte[numberOfBuffers][byteSizeOfVector]     catch IOException ex      return 1    finally      try        iffis  null          fis.close               iffc  null          fc.close             catch IOException exClose        return 1            return 0   private static long makeLongbyte[] data    if data  null  data.length  8 return 0x0    return long       long 0xFF amp data[0] ltlt 56         long 0xFF amp data[1] ltlt 48         long 0xFF amp data[2] ltlt 40         long 0xFF amp data[3] ltlt 32         long 0xFF amp data[4] ltlt 24         long 0xFF amp data[5] ltlt 16         long 0xFF amp data[6] ltlt 8          long 0xFF amp data[7] ltlt 0            private static double makeDoublebyte[] data    if data  null  data.length  8 return 0x0   return Double.longBitsToDoublemakeLongdata   private static double[] makeDoubleArraybyte[] data    if data  null return null   if data.length  8  0 return null    double[] doubleArray  new double[data.length  8]    for int index  0 index lt dbls.length index      doubleArray[index]  makeDoublenew byte[]          data[index8],         data[index81],         data[index82],         data[index83],         data[index84],         data[index85],         data[index86],         data[index87],                    return doubleArray   Override public DataPoint getint index    ifindex gt size  1      throw new IndexOutOfBoundsExceptionIndex exceeds length of list.    else ifindex lt 0      throw new IndexOutOfBoundsExceptionIndex is less than zero.       int bufferNumber  index  bufferSize   int bufferPosition  index  bufferSize   MappedByteBuffer buffer  buffers[bufferNumber]   synchronized buffer      buffer.load     buffer.positionbufferPosition  sizeOfVector     buffer.getreadArray[bufferNumber]       switchdataType    case DOUBLE     return new DoublePointmakeDoubleArrayreadArray[bufferNumber]   default     return null     codepre
Negative 904 pThis is something that has intrigued me a lot recently.

Negative 904 pWhat happens when we dont specify codeltmeta charsetutf8gtcode  in the HEAD of the HTML documentp
Negative 904 pI have a very annoying problem with a website that I have uploaded to a hosting server. When I try to view php pages with Firefox in Windows from the server all it says in the browser is The system cannot find the file specified.. It had been working for years before this and I have not changed anything on the server.p  pWhen I use the same link in Internet Explorer, it will load the page. I tried flushing the dns cache and clearing the Firefox cache but still have had no luck. I cleared the IE cache to make sure that IE was not storing it somehow as well and it still worked fine on IE.p  pI have tried googling that error message but it seems to usually be related to windows files missing etc. and I couldnt not find anything specifically to do with Firefox not loading a page.p  pWhat else can I do to troubleshoot this issuep

Negative 904 pSo lets take the usual Order example. Assuming a rich domain model we have an Order.place call. It seems the way to do additional tasks related to this action these days point to domain events. So lets say this call fires an OrderPlaced event.  The usual thing that happens after the event is placed is that we send a confirmation email so we create an event listener for this event, and send an email.p  pSo simply Order.place  OrderPlaced event raised  EmailForOrderPlaced listener fires  Email gets sentp  pWe also have registration that works in a similar way  User.register  UserRegistered event raised  Registration listener fires  Email gets sentp  pHoweverp  pThe problem a made up task  doesnt have to make sense  however lot of real business requirements dont anywayp  pNow we want to offer registration  order functionality in one, and opposed to the regular one email per registration  one email for the order, we only want ot send one email that contains both. This is an aggergated concern so normally we would create a domain service that does this, however if we call User.register Order.place now it will fire the 2 events as it would normally, spamming the customer with emails ok, not really, but this is an examplep  pSo how do we get around this Obviously sending the combined email is not a problem because we can raise an event for that in the service, but that still leaves us with the original 2 emails. If I detach the 2 listeners in the service before I execute the 2 calls, that would actually mean that I have to know about their functionality and every time a new one gets added I have to go back to the service detach that one as well, etc, is there a better way that would seamlessly do thisp

Negative 904 pIm working on a program to generate a bitmap, which first generates a river in a blue color Color.Blue. Now to test if the program can actually check for the same colors, so that I can replace it, I created a function that replaces the Color.Blue with Color.Yellow. The problem is that when I generate the Bitmap with the river, and then try to replace it with the other color, it cant seem to recognize the blue color, and for that matter replace it either. This is a really weird bug, and I cant seem to figure exactly what goes wrong. And Im pretty sure it generates the river in the correct color.

I was able to get up and running yesterday no problem and can send data to my database. to day I wanted to work on validation with ajax but I think I am going to leave the ajax out of it for a little while as I have a problem with the validation errors displaying.p  pThe validation is set up for the first two form fields like thisp  precodeltphp   class people extends AppModel      public name  people     public useTable  people      public validate  array         firstNamegtarray             rulegtnotEmpty,             messagegtEnter You First Name             ,         secondNamegtarray             rulegtnotEmpty,             messagegtEnter Your SecondFamily Name             ,          gt codepre  pand it works fine if those fields are empty it wont write to the database so far so good.  However, when I hit submit on the form the page refreshes, the error messages appear under the form fields but it also adds a completely new form under the previous one.  here is the controller.  Note the validateform function is from an cakephp with ajax tutorial i was following and is commented outp  precodeltphp   class peoplesController extends AppController      public name  peoples     public helpers  arrayHtml, form, Js     public components  arrayRequestHandler         public function index                if thisgtrequestgtispost                              data  thisgtrequestgtdata                 thisgtpeoplegtsavedata                               public function validateform              if thisgtRequestHandlergtisAjax                  thisgtdata[people][thisgtparams[form][field]]  thisgtparams[form][value]                 thisgtpeoplegtsetthisgtdata                 if thisgtpeoplegtvalidates                      thisgtautoRender  FALSE                                  else                      error  thisgtvalidateErrorsthisgtpeople                     thisgtseterror, error[thisgtparams[form][field]]                                            gt codepre  pand the view.  note the divs with id sending and success are also from the tutorial I was following but I dont think would have an effect on this particular issue.p  precode    ltdiv idsuccessgtltdivgt lth2gt Fill in your profile details lth2gt      ltphp  echo thisgtFormgtcreatepeople  echo thisgtFormgtinputfirstName echo thisgtFormgtinputsecondName echo thisgtFormgtinputaddressOne echo thisgtFormgtinputaddressTwo echo thisgtFormgtinputcity echo thisgtFormgtinputcounty echo thisgtFormgtinputcountry echo thisgtFormgtinputpostCode, array         label gt Zip Code,      echo thisgtFormgtinputdob, array         label gt Date of birth,         dateFormat gt DMY,         minYear gt dateY  70,         maxYear gt dateY  18,      echo thisgtFormgtinputhomePhone echo thisgtFormgtinputmobilePhone echo thisgtFormgtinputemail, array         type gt email       goptions  array1 gt Male, 2 gt Female gattributes  arraylegend gt false  echo thisgtFormgtradiogender,      goptions, gattributes       echo thisgtFormgtinputweight echo thisgtFormgtinputheight  toptions  array1 gt Tandem, 2 gt Solo tattributes  arraylegend gt false  echo thisgtFormgtradiotrained,     toptions, tattributes       echo thisgtFormgtinputreferedBy  echo thisgtFormgtsubmitsubmit  echo thisgtJsgtsubmitSend, array      beforegtthisgtJsgtgetsendinggteffectfadeIn,     successgtthisgtJsgtgetsendinggteffectfadeOut,     updategtsuccess        echo thisgtFormgtend      gt      ltdiv idsending styledisplay none backgroundcolor lightgreengtSending....           ltdivgt      ltphp  echo thisgtHtmlgtscript     validation, FALSE       gt codepre  pso the creation of the second identical form on the same page is my primary problem, I think it has something to do with the controller taking the first form and sending it back to the same view but I dont know how to trouble shoot this.  p  pa second problem is that for some reason if I use p  precodeecho thisgtFormgtsubmitsubmit codepre  pinstead of p  precodeecho thisgtJsgtsubmitsend, array beforegtthisgtJsgtgetsendinggteffectfadeIn, successgtthisgtJsgtgetsendinggteffectfadeOut, updategtsuccess codepre  pThen I dont get my error messages anymore I instead just get a bubble that appears and says please fill in this field  I am sure this is a jquery issue but again I dont know how to trouble shoot it so that that bullbe does not appear and it instead shows the error messages I wantp  pThanks in advancep

Negative 904 pWith my data model, which is basically a tree with parents children, Dozer is having issues successfully mapping them as it interprets a field which uses an interfacetype as a parameter as being a class, and trying to instantiate it with a constructor. This results in the following exceptionp  precodeERROR [MappingProcessor]  Field mapping error gt MapId null Type null Source parent class com..shared.model.Module Source field name parent Source field type class com..shared.model.Datawarehouse Source field value com..shared.model.Datawarehouse706ce458 Dest parent class com..shared.model.Module Dest field name parent Dest field type com..shared.model.Model org.dozer.MappingException java.lang.NoSuchMethodException com..shared.model.Model.ltinitgt codepre  pThis is a sameclass mapping, and Whilst Dozer correctly identifies the parent field on the source class as being of type Datawarehouse, because the set method on the Module class for its parent uses the Model interface as its parameter, it seems to be attempting to instantiate the type of Model, which of course fails as Model is an interface with no constructor, rather than Datawarehouse, as the source class field indicates.p  pI know about using beanfactories to alter the standard mapping behaviour, but Im surprised that this would be the only way to resolve this issue. It seems to me that Dozer already has the information it needs since it identifies the source class type, and unusual to me that it would try to instantiate the interface specified by the setters signature rather than the type it is attempting to map over.p  pAny suggestions p

Negative 904 pGiven an unsorted integer array and 2 numbers i and j such that 0 lt i lt j lt Ca constant say MAXINTEGER what kind of preprocessing can be performed on it so that you will be able to find the number of numbers between i and jboth inclusive in o1 time. The array can also have duplicates.p  pI had thought of building a frequency array f[] for the elements in the arrayspace oC and also another array cf[] for cumulative frequencyspace oC.p  pSo given i and j, i can look up the cumulative frequency array and do cf[j]  cf[i]  This will give the number of elements between i and j. To include i and j, look up the frequency array and add the values. ie cf[j]  cf[i]  f[i]f[j] Time complexity will be o1  4  constant time.p  pThe look up in the frequency array can be avoided by finding the previous non zero cf array element for both i and j in the respective direction.

Negative 904 pWe are looking for the computationally simplest function that will enable an indexed lookup of a function to be determined by a high frequency input stream of widely distributed integers and ranges of integers.   p  pIt is OK if the hashmap function selection itself varies based on the specific integer and range requirements, and the performance associated with the part of the code that selects this algorithm is not critical.   The number of integersranges of interest in most cases will be small zero to a few thousand.  The performance critical portion is in processing the incoming stream and selecting the appropriate function.p  pAs a simple example, please consider the following pseudocodep  precodeswitch highFrequencyIntegerStream     case2       func1     case3       func2     case8       func3     case33122  func4      ...      case10,000  func40 codepre  pIn a typical example, there would be only a few thousand of the cases shown above, which could include a full range of 32bit integer values and ranges.   In the pseudo code above 33122  represents all integers from 33 to 122.   There will be a large number of objects containing these switch statements. p  pNote that  the actual implementation will not include switch statements.  It will instead be a jump table which is an array of function pointers or maybe a combination of the Command and Observer patterns, etc.  The implementation details are tangential to the request, but provided to help with visualization.  p  pMany of the objects will contain switch statements with only a few entries.  The values of interest are subject to real time change, but performance associated with managing these changes is not critical.  Hashmap algorithms can be regenerated slowly with each update based on the specific integers and ranges of interest for a given object at a given time.p  pWe have searched around the internet, looking at  Bloom filters, various hash functions listed on  Wikipedias hash function page and elsewhere, quite a few Stack Overflow questions, abstract algebra mostly Galois theory which is attractive for its computationally simple operands, various ciphers, etc., but have not found a solution that appears to be targeted to this problem.  We could not even find a hash or map function that considered these types of ranges as inputs, much less a highly efficient one.  Perhaps we are not looking in the right places or using the correct vernacular.p  pThe current plan is to create a custom algorithm that preprocesses the list of interesting integers  and ranges for a given object at a given time looking for shifts and masks that can be applied to input stream to help delineate the ranges.   Note that most of the incoming integers will be uninteresting, and it is of critical importance to make a very quick decision for as large a percentage of that portion of the stream as possible which is why Bloom filters looked interesting at first before we starting thinking that their implementation required more computational complexity than other solutions.   p  pBecause the first decision is so important, we are also considering having multiple tables, the first of which would be inverse masks masks to select uninteresting numbers for the easy to find large ranges of data not included in a given switch statement, to be followed by subsequent tables that would expand the smaller ranges.   We are thinking this will, for most cases of input streams, yield something quite a bit faster than a binary search on the bounds of the ranges.p  pNote that the input stream can be considered to be randomly distributed.p

However, for some reason, only the fadein function works as intended. The fadeout function immediately draws the sprite overlay at its max opacity 255, but doesnt show the desired fadeout effect in spite of using the same algorithm as the fadein function does, though with different range values, of course.p  pEDITp  pAlright, I think I know the deal here.p  pThe fadeout function draws the overlay over the background... and leaves it there as it keeps continuously drawing it over it like a moron.p  pI get it.p  pIm gonna toy around with this.p  pHere are the two functionsp  pThis one worksp  precodedef fadeinself      self.FaderInUse.addself      for x in range0, 256, self.rate         self.colorfade.setalphax         screen.blit self.colorfade,  0, 0           pygame.display.flip         clock.tick15      self.FaderInUse.clear screen, screen      DrawScreen codepre  pThis one, however, doesnt quite cut itp  precodedef fadeoutself      self.FaderInUse.addself      for x in range 255, 1,  self.rate  1           self.colorfade.setalphax         screen.blit self.colorfade,  0, 0           pygame.display.flip         clock.tick15      self.FaderInUse.clear screen, screen      DrawScreen codepre

Negative 904 pIn my current Play 2 application, login sessions timeout after 5 minutes. When the user then clicks on any links in the app, they are redirected to the login page. After successful authentication, they are redirected to the main page.p  pI have implemented a system where the user is redirected to the page they were trying to reach before being redirected to the login page.p  pThe system works like this when the user with an expired session clicks an internal link, Deadbolt determines they are not logged in and redirects them to the login page. Before the redirect, it grabs the target url from the request header and stores it in the session. After the user fills out the login form on the following page, they submit the details to the authentication action. If the authentication is successful, the action checks to see if a target url exists in session if so, it clears the item from the session and redirects to the target url, if not, it redirects to the main page.p  pThe target url exists as a String for the duration and is fed into the codeplay.mvc.Results.redirect String url code method as such.p  pIm wondering if this opens up any potential attack vectors to my appp

Negative 904 pHere I have a problem figuring out to trigger a segue from within a custom UITableViewCell. p  pThe thing is that I have implemented an edit UIButton that would pass on the NSIndexPath of the UITableViewCell to the next ViewController in order to edit some entities from Core Data.p  pTherefore, all the methods and IBActions link are implemented inside the UITableViewClass, not in the UITableViewClass as usual. Normally, I would trigger code[self performSegue withIdentifier]code from the ViewController.m file, but here since the IBAction method is implemented inside the UITableViewCell.m file, theres no way to access its ViewController which later makes the code[self performSegue withIdentifier]code impossible. p  pI think this is quite common, but I still couldnt come up with a good idea to solve this problem.

Negative 904 pI hope I can explain this clearly.  I want to stop an applet, programmatically, from outside, in a polite manner that still returns a status code 0.p  pMore detail  Im working on a testingbenchmarking framework that execs appletviewer embed.html and gets the pid of the process thus launched.  What Ive been doing then is waiting for five seconds, then opening the X display and searching for a window whose strongNETWMPIDstrong property equals the pid, and sending strongWMDELETEMESSAGEstrong to that window.  However, this only works for Java 1.5 and above because 1.4 and below do not set strongNETWMPIDstrong so I cant find the window thats just been opened.p  pJust to be clear  using emsignalem isnt what I want because the closure of the applet should be normal, i.e. should not make appletviewer return nonzero.p  pJust to be clear again  this is a testingbenchmarking framework  the stopping must be initiated by the framework and not by modifying the applet.  We have a lot of applets to testrun and the framework must run them all, one by one, without user interaction.p  pMethods Ive considered arep  ol lipMake a list of windows whose strongWMCLASSstrong property includes strongsunappletmainstrong, before and after the emexecem, and diff the lists to work out what windows opened after the emexecem.pli lipWrite my own appletviewer and make it accept strongSIGUSR1strong and close the applet, e.g., by calling the emdestroyem method.pli ol  pAny better suggestions p

Negative 904 pI am currently setting [UICollectionController useLayoutToLayoutNavigationTransitions] property to YES in order to perform layout to layout transition for [UINavigationController pushViewControlleranimated  popViewControllerAnimated]. In addition, I have implemented pinch gesturebased interactive transitions.p  pAlso, I have defined a custom UICollectionViewTransitionLayout that behaves differently from original behavior of UICollectionViewTransitionLayout. Lets call this CustomLayoutTransition. I create an instance of CustomLayoutTransition object and return it from [UICollectionViewDelegate collectionViewtransitionLayoutForOldLayoutnewLayout].p  pI am expecting two behaviors when I create and return an instance of CustomLayoutTransition.p  pemCustomLayoutTransition is used to perform custom layouttolayout transitionsembr 1 when interactive transition is triggered by pinch gesture orbr 2 when I pushpop an instance of UICollectionViewController.

Negative 904 pI am working on a web game a hrefhttpszarada.netwyscigi relnofollowhttpszarada.netwyscigia for crossword solvers Polish language. One of features I am planning to introduce is to support moving a cursor on a crossword diagram using arrow keys. To provide even more user experience, I would like to support key press event not key down or key up for arrow keys wherever possible in order to let the user move the cursor by multiple fields with long key press.p  pWhat I was able to realise by examining several Internet resources including multiple StackOverflow entries is that only some browsers do support the key press for arrow keys.p  pHere comes my question  how to detect whether the browser supports the feature of firing a key press event for arrow key I was thinking about just detecting a browser plus browser version, but feature based solution would obviously be more scalable.

None of this work HW control not work at all, data transfer just stops often at middle of byte when strongspacestrong state on TXD stucks and never continues after release of BUSY.

Negative 904 pI try to use ifelse to assign values to several variables through a loop but it gives me NAs for all cases and variables.p  pI have one dataset of occupational histories all jobs one has had, where each job is coded as q08dXX were XX stands for numbers from 01 to 16. Each job has a starting age, stored in a variable q08paXX where XX stands for numbers from 12 to 70. I want to create variables job12 to job70, standing for the current job at a given year for all respondents of the survey. After having created a new data frame with the variables job12 to job70 and assigned NAs to all of them, I want to populate them with the real values based on the values of q08dXX and q08paXX.p  pMy code looks like thisp  precodefor spell in c01,02,03,04,05,                 06,07,08,09,10,11,12,                 13,14,15,16     for age in 1270       newdata[,pastejob,age, sep] lt ifelse       olddata[,pasteq08pa,spell,sep]age amp         olddata[,pasteq08pa,spell,sep]NA,  check if new spell started and if starting time not missing       olddata[,pasteq08d,spell,sep],  assign value of new spell if it started       newdata[,pastejob,age, sep]  keep existing value if new spell didnt start     codepre  pHere, olddata is the data frame that holds the type of job and the age that job started and  new data is the new data frame where I want to create the jobXX variables. Somehow, I get a data frame full of NAs after running this code. What is the problem here Is it with ifelse Is it anything related to the scope and ifelse not being able to access the loop variables correctlyp

Negative 904 pTwo jsperfs relating to the questionbr a hrefhttpjsperf.comcachethisvanilla relnofollowCacheing thisabr a hrefhttpjsperf.comcachebooleans relnofollowCacheing booleansap  pIm on Mac 10.9.  In Safari 7, Chrome 32, and Firefox 26, storing this inside a variable seems to run slightly slower than not storing it.  For examplep  precodefunction O          var THIS  this          THIS.foo  foo         THIS.bar  bar         THIS.baz  baz  codepre  pwas a bit slower thanp  precodefunction O      this.foo  foo     this.bar  bar     this.baz  baz  codepre  pWhy is this Is it because this references the original object every timep  pIn Chrome and Firefox, storing a Boolean object and then referencing the value of that variable later seemed to run a bit faster than writing true or false every time in theory, creating a new Boolean object every time. BUT, in Safari, the opposite appeared to be true.  For examplep  precodefunction lt      ifarguments[0] lt arguments[1] return true     return false  codepre  pwas a bit faster in Firefox and Chrome thanp  precodevar TRUE  true,     FALSE  false  function lt      ifarguments[0] lt arguments[1] return TRUE     return FALSE  codepre  pWith the exception of Safari, is this because a new Boolean object is being created every time when not storing it inside a variable  What could be the explanation as to why there was the opposite effect in Safarip  pIm inclined to think that in small bits of code, the difference would be negligible, but Im curious if it could make a difference with which someone should be concerned when the code gets much lengthier.  I also read a question asking about performance data vs. perceived performance, where perceived performance is generally the thing to look at in these cases.p  pAn issue with the above statistics in the jsperfs is the lack of a large data sample.  The reason I ask this question is because Im writing a small JS library.  In that context, strongwhat are best practices as far as caching certain objectsstrongp

I looked into it more and I thought about using the fetch functionality in backbone, but Im not too sure hes using that either.p  pIt appears like hes doing something like Rendr by Airbnb.

However, the style has a few other setters including a nontrivial template, so Id prefer if those could be shared across multiple instances of my control.p  p2 Split the property of type codePencode into separate properties for brush, thickness, dash style etc. This would cause the codeDynamicResourcecode to be used directly in the styles setter, which then allows the style to be frozen. though Im not sure on the exact details of when a style is freezable This solution isnt desirable as I have multiple properties of type Pen, and each of those has quite a few properties that a user might want to customize.

Negative 904 pfor my program I need to be able to upload and download files to a file server for persistence. I already have an OpenLink Virtuoso Universal Server running because I want to harness its triple store capabilities later on. p  pAccording to the specification of the server it should be possible to uploaddownload files via the FTP protocol. From the information I gathered I assume that I have to specify a new user that has the rights to upload files and I found a tutorial that explains how I can upload files with the Apache Commons Net API in Java a hrefhttpwww.codejava.netjavasenetworkingftpjavaftpfileuploadtutorialandexample relnofollowApache Commons Net API Tutoriala. After I upload a file ideally the Virtuoso server would host the file and returned an http URL where I can access the file while the server is running.p  pSo my question is if someone can show me how to configure the Virtuoso Server so it is possible to upload and download files. The Virtuoso is running on localhost because I want to keep the whole program inside my development computer. I already tried uploading a file with connecting the FTPClient viap  precodeFTPClient client  new FTPClient FileInputStream fis  null  try       client.connectlocalhost, 21     client.logindba, password     String filename  text.txt      fis  new FileInputStreamfilename      client.storeFilefilename, fis     client.logout   catch SocketException e       TODO Autogenerated catch block     e.printStackTrace   catch IOException e       TODO Autogenerated catch block     e.printStackTrace  codepre  pWhere dba is the standard administrator account that is shipped with the Virtuoso server.

I can access the admin console via localhost8890 so I assume the server is running.p  pI a novice regarding ftpservers so please keep your answer simple.

Negative 904 pMy Kendo autocomplete control retrieves a Json list successfully. Unfortunately, it calls the MVC controller method twice and creates two suggestion lists. The duplicate list is displayed directly behind the first. When a value is selected from the first suggestion list, the list disappears, but the duplicate list remains visible.

Negative 904 pCurrently, I am taking up the long method of doing this by getting a list of processes using the following commandp  precodesudo ps eo pid,command  grep v grep  awk print 1 gt pids.txt codepre  pAnd then iterating through the process ids and executing in background the strace of each process and generating logs for each process with the process id in the logs extensionp  precodefilename1 while read r line do chmod x straceProgram.sh .straceProgram.sh line amp done lt filename codepre  pstraceProgram.shp  precodepid1 sudo strace p pid o log.pid codepre  pHowever, the problem with this approach is that if there is any new process which gets started, it will not be straced since the strace is on the process ids stored in the pids.txt during the first run. The list of pids.txt can be updated with new process ids, however, I was inquisitive on running a strace at an operating system level which would strace all the activities being performed. Could there be a better way to do thisp

Negative 904 pIm perpetually trying to wrap my head around the usage of codelttfootgtcode, and which direction I should head for the most accessible approach.p  pcodelttfootgtcode is supposed to summarise the columns in a perfect situation, every column has a corresponding summary cell in the codelttfootgtcode.p  pUnfortunately, this is pretty much never the case.p  pUsually there are only a couple of columns that have numerical data, the others being text, and thus, unsummarisable.p  pThe typical thing Ive always done, and many seem to do, is have blank cells in the codelttfootgtcode, as well as one cell that uses codecolspanltnumgtcode to provide a label saying strongTotalstrong or something similar.p  pNow, since the attribute codescopecolcode isnt being used, but rather codeidcodes with codeheaderscode, a part of me thinks that even though that strongTotalstrong cell doesnt correspond to the two columns it is spanning, this is okay, because of the codeheaderscode. However, is it really okayp  pIm not sure. Im never sure. Part of me wants to insert one cell that spans all the columns, in order to insert a fresh table with only these three cells. That seems equally wrong.p  pSemantically, I think the best idea might be to take the Totals out of the table entirely, and have a codeltdlgtcode with the Total text and the corresponding figures.p  pA clear insight would be much appreciated.

I take care of the resizing in viewDidLayoutSubviews like thisp  precode voidviewDidLayoutSubviews      self.orderItemTableViewHeightConstraint.constant  self.orderItemTableView.contentSize.height  [self tableViewself.orderItemTableView heightForHeaderInSection0]     self.shippingOptionTableViewHeightConstraint.constant  self.shippingMethodTableView.contentSize.height      [self.view layoutIfNeeded]      self.scrollViewContainerViewHeightConstraint.constant  self.shippingMethodTableView.bottom      [self.view layoutIfNeeded]  codepre  pThis works as expected.p  pHowever, when shippingOptionTableView is built, it has 3 cells for this example, each with a model that feeds the label in the cell and a selection marker like thisp  precode UITableViewCell tableViewUITableView tableView cellForRowAtIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath      if tableView  self.shippingMethodTableView          DLShippingOptionTableCell cell  [tableView dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifierSHIPPINGOPTIONCELLIDENTIFIER]          if cell  nil              NSString nibName  UIUSERINTERFACEIDIOM  UIUserInterfaceIdiomPhone  DLShippingOptionTableCelliphone  DLShippingOptionTableCell              NSArray topLevelObjects  [[NSBundle mainBundle] loadNibNamednibName ownernil optionsnil]              for id currentObject in topLevelObjects                  if [currentObject isKindOfClass[DLShippingOptionTableCell class]]                      cell  DLShippingOptionTableCell currentObject                     [cell setupCell]                     break                                                 cell.model  [self.model.shippingOptionArray objectAtIndexindexPath.row]          return cell          else          ...       codepre  pThe model gets set in the table cell, which causes the visual state to be updatedp  precode voidsetModelDLShippingOption model      model  model      NSNumberFormatter currencyFormatter  [[NSNumberFormatter alloc] init]     [currencyFormatter setNumberStyleNSNumberFormatterCurrencyStyle]      NSString numberAsString  [currencyFormatter stringFromNumber[NSNumber numberWithFloatmodel.priceInPennies  100.0f]]      self.shippingLabel.text  [NSString stringWithFormat , model.optionName, numberAsString]      [self toggleSelectedStatemodel.isSelected]    voidtoggleSelectedStateBOOLisSelected      [self setSelectedisSelected]      self.radioButtonImageView.image  isSelected  [UIImage imageNamed radiobuttonselected.jpg]  [UIImage imageNamed radiobuttonunselected.jpg]  codepre  pHere is the problem... the table cell get sent setSelectedNO repeatedly during the layout process.  So, even when my model is set to selected, and I update the radiobutton graphic which I would normally do in setModel it gets overridden and changed to false.p  pI had to put this hack in place to make it work basically adding this bit of code to the cellForRowAtIndexPath in the ViewController, just after setting the cells modelp  precodeif cell.model.isSelected      [self.shippingMethodTableView selectRowAtIndexPathindexPath animatedNO scrollPositionUITableViewScrollPositionNone]  codepre  pI this bites... So the question is, why are table cells getting sent setSelectedNO over and over and over during layout, and is there a better way to overcome thatp

Negative 904 pWe currently have an asp.net webforms web application, which needs updating in terms of look and speed.  I think its time to redevelop it and was thinking about creating a webApi and change the website to asp mvc.  But then i started using AngularJS and loved it, now i am thinking about redeveloping our site using AngularJs and a webApi.p  pAm i right in thinking that using AngularJs  ASP MVC is pointless, as they are nearly the same thing although 1 is clientside and 1 is server sidep  pAlso i have a couple questions about using angularJs on a website.p  ol lipOn the mobile apps that i have used angularJS i have used the routeProvider and stateProvider to change the page.  This adds SOMETHING to the url and angular loads the correct content accordingly.  Does this work ok with search engines like googlepli lipShould the whole web application be 1 app within angular, or should it be broken down into app modules and each be a separate app, even though it is 1 website  I am wondering about performance.  Say i have a website where the user can look at companies, contacts, projects.  Each module may have 10 different pages, can angular handle this  In our app we would have over 20 modules, each with maybe 10 pages.pli lipIs this something i should avoid  Would ASP MVC  webApi be betterpli ol  pAny other views and opinions are greatly welcome, i want to get as much information as possible before making my decision and developing.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 904 pSo Ive got a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions24603558animatedpiechartthatcananimateinbothdirectionsthisa animated pie chart working now. It can indicate e.g. progress over time similar to codeUIProgressViewcode.p  pFor legacy reasons I am still using it with a timer that fires approx. every second and increases codeprogresscode. It should now be possible to get rid of this timer and set the overall duration of a pie animation e.g. to 12 hour instead of letting the timer fire 30  60 times and starting as many short incremental animations.p  pSo my question is this are there any good reasons that speak against using such long say up to 12 hour long animations in iOS In the example of the pie chart no more than approx. 360 frames would be needed even over 12 hour.p

Negative 904 pI work with a team where everyones indentation settings are different. I like 2 spaces for a tab, while others like the default 4, and some like 3 why. I had everyone set their documents to use tabs instead of spaces, so everyone would be happy. However, the Tabify bar pops up, constantly asking if we want to tabify the document. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comjdVOn.png altTabify document dialog in code editorp  pThe actual logic behind this is smart in that it tabs anything that should be tabbed and leaves other whitespace alone. Thats great. My problem is with the bar itself. I want it to auto tabify my documents and never ask me. We find ourselves ignoring the bar, which when code is checked into source control, looks all jacked up on other peoples IDEs.p  pIs there a way to tell it to always tabify the document on save and never ask mep

Negative 904 pI have written a dissector for a custom protocol in Lua and Im now going to refactor it in C.

In Lua this wasnt a problem since the required arguments can be hardcoded in and easily edited  same obviously does not apply to compiled C module. p  pHow can I pass a configuration argument to Wireshark dissector I can access it from a file system but that seems like a nasty way to do it. p
Negative 904 pIs there a good way to implement editing of a PlaceholderField before the model is added to an appp  pI have an app with an apphook, and at present one has to create the model in the admin interface, save it causing it to appear on the website, and then add the CMS content to the alreadyvisible rendering of the model.

Negative 904 pIm not entirely sure how to ask this question, so my apologies if its unclear or not appropriate for discussion here.  Im currently in the process of trying to redesign the general workflow of my lab, and am coming up against a conceptual roadblock that is largely due to my general lack of knowledge in this subject.  Our data currently is organized in a typical file system structure along the lines of p  pDateCell Sweep p  pwhere for a specific date there are generally multiple Cell folders, and within those Cell folders there are multiple Sweep files these are relatively simple .csv files where the recording parameters are saved separated in .xml files. So within any Date folder there may be a few tens to several hundred files for recordings that day organized within multiple Cell subdirectory folders. p  pOur workflow typically involves opening multiple sweep files within a Cell folder, averaging them, and then averaging those with data points from other Cell folders, often across multiple days. p  pThis is relatively straightforward to do with the Pandas and Numpy, although there is a certain manual feel to it when remotely accessing folders saved to the lab server. We also, on occasion, run into issues because we often have to pull in data from many of these files at once. While this isnt usually an issue, the files can range between a few MBs to 1000s of MBs in size. In the latter case we have to take steps to not load the entire file into memory or not load multiple files at once at the very least to avoid memory issues. p  pAs part of this redesign I have been reading about Pytables for data organization and for accessing data sets that may be too large to store within memory. So I guess my 2 main questions are p  ol liIf the outofmemory issues arent significant i.e. that utility wouldnt be utilized often, are there any significant advantages to using something like Pytables for data organization over simply maintaining a file system on a server or locally li liIs there any reason NOT to go the Pytables database route We are redesigning our data collection as well as our storage, and one option is to collect the data directly into Pandas dataframes and save the files in the HDF5 file type. Im currently weighing the costbenefit of doing this over the current system of the data being stored into csv files and then loaded into Pandas for analysis later on. li ol  pMy thinking is that by creating a database vs. the filesystem we current have we may 1. be able to reduce somewhat anyway file size on disk through the compression that hdf5 offers and 2. accessing data may overall become easier because of the ability to query based on different parameters. But my concern for 2 is that ultimately, since were usually just opening an entire file, that we wont be utilizing that to functionality all that much  that wed basically be performing the same steps that we would need to perform to open a file or a series of files within a file system. Which makes me wonder whether the upfront effort that this would require is worth it in terms of our overall workflow. p
Negative 904 pI am having a problem that occurred in a specific circumstances in my Delphi 7 application.p  pI have ADOConnection that goes to my MS SQL server with some username and pass  SQL authentication. The problem is that MS SQL login was created with User must change pass at next login flag that makes ADO Connection impossible to connect with error message 18488  Login failed for user .ls. Reason The password of the account must be changed.p  pNormally, in MS SQL Management Studio a change password prompt is shown, and user is able to enter new password. The question is what should I do to force password change on this user in my application I am able to catch error number and prompt for login change, but what then There is no flag in a connection string that I could use to change passreset to new like Old Password and New Password. What sould I do thenp  pCan anyone helpp

My question is what can I do about it I was thinking of writing a function that would convert Polish signs in code into their respective UTF8 representation but that seems far from optimal and rather difficult. Another option would be just to use this UTF8 representation whenever i would need a Polish sign, but then again, I dont believe it should be this hard and convoluted. Whats interesting, when I fetch such a string from database and display it, everything works correctly.p  pScript file is encoded as UTF8 without BOM.p

Negative 904 pIm currently trying to teach myself some responsive design, and just wanted some opinions on the best way of tackling the problem that I have. Ive decided to start by making an existing project of mine a hrefhttpsgithub.comantm611MusicServerGUI relnofollowhttpsgithub.comantm611MusicServerGUIa functional on a mobile device. Im going to do this by stripping out the Twitter Bootstrap library and using my own CSS.p  pAs you can see from the screenshot on GitHub, the main Albums view has a pane on the left to select an artist, and a pane on the right to display albums by the selected artist. I have achieved this with two separate unordered lists. However, my plan for devices with smaller viewports will be to display this as one list, arranged in the following structurep  ul liArtist 1li liArtist 2 selected ul liAlbum 1li liAlbum 2 selected ul liTrack 1li liTrack 2li ulli liAlbum 3li ulli liArtist 3li ul  pIf I was just designing the mobile site standalone, I would achieve this with nested lists as above. However, this would require the actual HTML to be different. As I understand responsive design, the goal is normally to use the same markup, but change the way it is displayed to the user based on media queries.p  pIf someone could point me in the best way to tackle this sort of problem, I would be very grateful.p  pThanks very muchp

Negative 904 pI am using external table for ETL. The access driver creates a bad file which contains records which were bad in some way like data type mismatch. However, constraint violations like unique constraint violation are not written to Bad file by access driver and thus have to be handled in the loading process from external table and put into some other bad file created for this second part of load process. Please suggest some good design to merge these two bad files or handle bad data in a unified way.p

Negative 904 pThis is something Ive been wondering for a while. Is performance always better when using native PHP functions than their PHP loop equivalents Why or why notp  pHere are two examples to illustrate the questionp  ul liSay I have a large array with 1000 elements. Each value is just an integer userid. I want to see if a particular userid is in the array, and I happen to know it will be towards the end of the array as it would have been added recently. I have two options a do a regular PHP codeforeachcode loop that goes through the whole array until it finds the userid, or b do an codearrayreversecode on the array and do the same codeforeachcode loop until it finds the id if it exists, it will end this loop sooner. Which is fasterli ul  pMy gut tells me the first option is faster since it does one loop, and the second option is slower because behind the scenes, codearrayreversecode is emalsoem doing some kind of loop in C, thereby requiring two loops for the operation.p  ul liIf I have a large multidimensional array where each value is [messageid, message], will it be slower to use a codeforeachcode loop to find a particular message by id, than it is to set the messageid as the key for the element and doing codeissetarray[messageid] ampamp array[messageid]codeli ul  pEdit just to clarify, Im aware the first example can use arraysearch, since this is a very simplified example. The main question isnt which one is faster as benchmarks can let me know easily, but emwhyem, as in, whats going on behind the scenesp

The amount of memory needed to store a string is dependent on the length of the string. But the complexity or size of a function seems to be irrelevant. Why is this sop

Negative 904 pIm using the Colorbox plugin a hrefhttpwww.jacklmoore.comcolorbox relnofollowhttpwww.jacklmoore.comcolorboxa for modal windows and have hit an interestingweight snag. I want to set the width of the modal based on the page thats being opened, so I set a data attribute in the body tag, and then use the .resize function in colorbox to the heightwidth of the loaded body.p  pOn page load, Im doing the followingp  precodeparent..colorbox.resize innerWidth body.datamodalWidth   parent..colorbox.resize innerHeight body.height   codepre  pIve also logged those heightswidths, but on about half the pages, the height doesnt calculate properly. For example, when looking in Firebug on Firefox, one page body shows the height at 133px, but jQuery tells me the height is 115px. The HTML on that page is next to identical to another page whose height is calculated correctly. Im not sure how else to get it to work properly.p  pIm not sure if this matters or is part of the problem, but it seems the iframe is defaulting to 150px I cant get it to fit the height of the bodyhtml, unless its taller than 150px.p

Negative 904 pCan you use the .NET DirectoryEntry.MoveTo to move an object to another Active Directoryp  pI guess it depends on how the .MoveTo method is working, does it create a separate connection and get the object locally and then make a separate connection againp  pIf it tries to do it in the same context then I can assume this would not work.p  pThanksp
Negative 904 pI am consuming java based web service from .Net application. The problem arise, when I got deserialized response from the web service, some of the fields in response comes with null values, but if I look at xml response, response has its proper values.

Negative 904 pI am porting a VBA and an associated dylib program from Windows Excel 20102014 to Mac Excel 2010.  Before it performs an operation, the VBA changes the current working directory to the installation folder, to make the input files available to the DLL.p  pThe dylib is based on gfortran 4.9.0.  I put the dylib file in the lib folder, and VBA can locate it, use it to perform calculations and return results.p  pHowever, when I try to perform any disk operations getcwd, open, an error is thrown.  I can return the error 13, which appears to be permission denied according to usrincludesyserrno.h.p  pI am able to place a gfortran dll in lib, and have another fortran program call it successfully from the command prompt, not within Excel and write a file in the current working directory, so it seems like it ought to work.p  pAny thoughts on who owns the spawned dylib processes and how to perform disk operations by a gfortran dylib from a VBA call would be appreciated.p

Yes, we want to disconnect the object returned from the database, so I expect this to return MyObject with all of the MyObjectChild objects attached. The awkward part is that the database has thouasands of emMyObjectChildems, but once in a blue moon it decides NOT to load them.p  pLater in the code, I havep  precode    MyObject myObject  GetMyObject123456      foreach MyObjectChild c in myObject.MyObjectChilds              ...  Do some stuff       codepre  pVery randomly one time in a hundred this foreach loop doesnt have any records to foreach over.

This will be much more cumbersome for me to implement based on my current code.

But any selection change performed after that calls the server event successfully. Its as if the first manual change after the change handled programmatically by the client method is ignored as a ServerSide Event. Then any manual change after that falls back in sync with the server.p  pHow can I ensure that every change event of the RadioButtonList triggers the server side OnSelectedIndexChanged event and why does changing the selected index via Javascript render the second manual change moot and functionality is resumed after thatp  pAll these controls reside inside of a UserControl.p

Negative 904 pstrongMaking the class fieldproperty privatestrong  is one of the best practice in OOP. To access the codeprivatecode fieldproperty we can use public stronggetterstrong method. But only writing the stronggetterstrong method may not enough according to a hrefhttpviralpatel.netblogsmostusefuljavabestpracticequotesjavadevelopers relnofollowthis blogPlease see Quote 2a. It suggests returning a clone of the fieldproperty if it is a reference type from the stronggetterstrong method. By following this approach we can make the fieldproperty unmodifiable. Please see the code below  p  precodepublic class Department    Employee admin    ...    ...    ...    public Employee getAdmin      return admin.clone      codepre  pSo from now the codeadmincode is unmodifiable by the outer world if we dont use any strongsetterstrong. This approach looks pretty nice. But I hardly found any code which implements this approach. Is there any drawbacks of using this approach which may defeats the benefit of using this approachbr Thanks in advance. p

For starters, here is my post domain objectp  precodeEntity public class Post implements Serializable   ManyToManyfetch  FetchType.EAGER, cascade  CascadeType.MERGE, CascadeType.PERSIST, CascadeType.REFRESH JoinTable         name  POSTKEYWORD,         joinColumns  JoinColumnname  POSTID, referencedColumnName  POSTID,         inverseJoinColumns  JoinColumnname  KEYWORDID, referencedColumnName  ID  private SetltKeywordgt keywords  new HashSetltgt codepre  pThe author, category, and keyword objects are all very boring and all basically look like thisp  precodeEntity public class Keyword implements Serializable   Id GeneratedValuestrategy  GenerationType.SEQUENCE, generator  keywordidseq SequenceGeneratorname  keywordidseq, sequenceName  keywordidseq, allocationSize  1 private Long id  Columnname  KEYWORDVALUE private String value private int count  1 codepre  pp  pThe author and category classes dont have the int count, just simply id and value fields.p  pHere is my PostDaop  precodepublic ListltPostgt universalFindString value, int maxResults           create a new string that is built for case insensitive like sql searches     String upperValue    value.toUpperCase        final CriteriaBuilder criteriaBuilder  entityManager.getCriteriaBuilder        build the criteria query and get the path for the category value     CriteriaQueryltPostgt postQuery  criteriaBuilder.createQueryPost.class.distincttrue     RootltPostgt postRoot  postQuery.fromPost.class      ListltPredicategt predicates  new ArrayListltgt       find titles containing the value     Predicate titlePredicate  criteriaBuilder.likecriteriaBuilder.upperpostRoot.getPost.title, upperValue     predicates.addtitlePredicate                find keywords containing the value     SetJoinltPost, Keywordgt postKeywords  postRoot.joinPost.keywords     PathltStringgt keywordPath  postKeywords.getKeyword.value     Predicate keywordPredicate  criteriaBuilder.likecriteriaBuilder.upperkeywordPath, upperValue     predicates.addkeywordPredicate      select.wherecriteriaBuilder.orpredicates.toArraynew Predicate[]      TypedQuery typedQuery  entityManager.createQueryselect     ListltPostgt resultList  typedQuery.getResultList     return resultList  codepre  pIt all works as expected when all the data is populated in a Post object.  If I have two posts with Test in the title, and I search for test, I will get both posts back.  However, if I remove all of the keywords from one of the posts, that post no longer shows up in the search results.  I can use pgadmin to verify it is in the database.p  pIf I comment out the SetJoin section for the keyword in my DAO, the posts without keywords will suddenly appear in my searches.p  pIs there some way to prevent this, so that I can have a post without keywords and it will still show up in the results if the search term matches any one of the other fields  p  pEDIT I cut this down to the bare minimum Frankenstein code I possibly couldp

But what I want to do is return an option if no matching string can be found once iterating through the entire array.  The obvious problem is that if I include an else option in my current ifstatement, each iteration that there is no match moves to the else.  p  pSo basically, I want to scan through the entire array.. IF theres a match I want to print abc and if there is no match at all I want to print xyz.

There are some data using comma insted of dots, so codeimportdatacode will not work, but the import data tool does. p  pSo im wondering and hoping if it is possible to edit the generated function to import all the files in the directory, in such a way as the single file is imported I want each file to be imported as matrix variable double. I want to import all the files in one process loop. Also there are many files and they all have some 100 000 lines or so. p  pIf someone see an easy way to do this i would appreciate the help. Please keep the explanation on a low level, as im quite novice. I get the following function using the import data tool p  precode    function Streaming0x00x00158D00000E04621709201405  importfile1filename, startRow, endRow IMPORTFILE1 Import numeric data from a text file as a matrix.

Negative 904 pI have created a custom class for NSTableview and then created a Protocoldelegate for row selection in the custom class.Then in the View controller XIB i got NSTableview and I have changed the class to Custom class. I created a IBOutlet for the same and then set the custom delegate to strongselfstrong inside the method stronginitWithNibNamestrong from view controller. And also I have written the delegate methods inside the View controller. But the delegate method is not called on the row selection. The delegate object is nil and also delegate is not reposing to the selector. Could any one guide me what am i doing wrong or if any thing is missingp

I would prefer to generate the sequence on the fly, but havent come up with a good way to do so.p  pAlternatively, I have attempted to seed my query by looking at what I know to be used addressesp  precodedeclare subnetsk int  1  select unassignedrange.   from select castl.address as bigint  1 as start               ,mincastfr.address as bigint  1 as stop           from ipaddress as l                left join ipaddress as r on l.address  r.address  1                left join ipaddress as fr on l.address lt fr.address          where r.address is null and fr.address is not null            and l.subnetsk  subnetsk         group by l.address, r.address as unassignedrange        join dhcprange dhcp          on unassignedrange.start             not between castdhcp.beginaddress as bigint                 and castdhcp.endaddress as bigint         and unassignedrange.stop             not between castdhcp.beginaddress as bigint                 and castdhcp.endaddress as bigint  where dhcp.subnetsk  subnetsk codepre  pSadly the above query does not work when there is nothing in the codeipaddresscode or codedhcprangecode tables. Worse since it is unaware of the bounds of the subnet range a codedhcprangecode towards the upper bound of the subnet range will artificially limit what is returned as the query cannot return rows from empty space at the edges. The performance is also not outstanding.p  pUsing SQL or TSQL how do I determine the next minimum available integer value within an arbitrary integer range limited by other rangesp

Negative 904 pI have a Spring MVC project that uses .csv files to store my data for now the data are stored locally in C in my computer. p  pMy objective is to strongdisplay every row of data in the csv file up until the last one on my jsp pagestrong. In order to do this I realize I would need both a loop in the Controller file to read data from the csv file, and a loop in the jsp page to fetch and display them on the webpage. p  pI have tried using a p  precodeltcforEachgt  codepre  pin the jsp page, by appending the csv data into a whole string separated by row with a delimiter  at the end of each row and then fetch the whole appended long string through the model and pass into the jsp and do a p  precodeltcforEachgt  codepre  pon jsp page, using split to split them by the delimiter mentioned and display the data row one by one. The problem with this method is that each time I refresh the webpage, the same chunk of data will be duplicated and displayed and it just gets duplicated longer and longer. p  pHow should I do this

Negative 904 pI am trying to find a solution for the following puzzle. I have java projects, managed by maven, which needs some native dependencies to work run unit and integration tests. Those are provided in form of deb packages, which needs to be installed prior to running a build. p  pI use Jenkins for CI. Native dependencies can not be installed on Jenkins nodes, because of conflicts with other builds and they can change often. What I do now is not to create a Jenkins job type maven, but freestyle and use a pbuilder to create an clean sandbox, install all that is necessary and invoke maven build.p  pThis is working great, but I am loosing Jenkins maven goodies like automatic upstream projects, trigger build when dependency change, etc. Jenkins simply does not know that maven is there.p  pFinally, my question. Is there a way how to achieve both, isolate build so installed libraries does not affect other builds and leverage Jenkinss magic applied to maven builds and their dependenciesp

Negative 904 pstrongContextstrong We are using MFP v6.3 on Tomcat v7.0.57 running on a Linux system. Wed like to use the MFP ANT tasks to automate the deployment of MFP artifacts to our development and staging MFP servers. Specifically, we want to automate the deployment of the WAR file for MFP applications.p  pBefore installing the WAR file, we use the unconfigureApplicationServer ANT task to remove any previous installations that may exist on the Tomcat server of the WAR file. Then we use the configureDatabase ANT task to create the two required databases. Finally, we use the configureApplicationServer ANT task to installdeploy the WAR file.p  pstrongProblemstrong We can execute all of the above ANT tasks i.e., unconfigureApplicationServer, configureDatabase, configureApplicationServer without any errors. We can also see the WAR file on the file system under the Tomcat webapps folder. However, after this, attempting to deploy any adapters or wlapp files throws an error stating that the necessary WAR file does not exist. We also restarted the Tomcat server but this made no difference. Accessing the MFP console does not show an entry for the MFP app. Also, if we launch the configurationTool.sh tool, we dont see an entry for the runtime either.p  pTo verify that there is not a problem with the WAR file, we used the configurationTool.sh tool to deploy it. Using the configurationTool.sh tool to deploy the WAR file works just fine though a Tomcat restart was needed. p  pAfter reading the MFP documentation on the KnowledgeCenter, we understood that we could use ANT tasks to automate the deployment uninstall and install of MFP WAR files on the MFP server tomcat by simply passing the right parameters to them. We are also expecting that a server tomcat restart is not required whenever a WAR file is installed or updated.p  pAny ideas on what could be wrong Thanks.p  pstrongCodestrong We are using Gradle to invoke the different ANT tasksp  precodetask uninstallMFPArtifacts ltlt      ant.unconfigureApplicationServercontextRoot contextRoot          projectwarfile warFile         applicationserver              tomcatinstalldir installDir                  databasekind Worklight              mysqldatabase dbPrefix  MFP,                 server localhost,                 user dbUser,                 password dbUser             driverclasspath                  pathelementlocation  mySQLJarPath                                       databasekind WorklightReports              mysqldatabase dbPrefix  MFPRPT,                 server localhost,                 user dbUser,                 password dbUser             driverclasspath                  pathelementlocation  mySQLJarPath                                println Uninstalled appShortName   task setupMFPDBs ltlt       Create databases     ant.configureDatabasekind Worklight          mysqldatabase dbPrefix  MFP,             server localhost,             user dbUser,             password dbUser              dbauser dbaUser,                 password dbaPassword             clienthostname localhost             clienthostname 127.0.0.1                     driverclasspath              pathelementlocation  mySQLJarPath                       println Created dbPrefix  MFP database.      ant.configureDatabasekind WorklightReports          mysqldatabase dbPrefix  MFPRPT,             server localhost,             user dbUser,             password dbUser              dbauser dbaUser,                 password dbaPassword             clienthostname localhost             clienthostname 127.0.0.1                  driverclasspath              pathelementlocation  mySQLJarPath                   println Created dbPrefix  MFPRPT database.   task deployMFPArtifacts ltlt        Install WAR file     ant.configureApplicationServercontextRoot contextRoot          projectwarfile warFile         applicationserver              tomcatinstalldir installDir                  databasekind Worklight              mysqldatabase dbPrefix  MFP,                 server localhost,                 user dbUser,                 password dbUser             driverclasspath                  pathelementlocation  mySQLJarPath                                       databasekind WorklightReports              mysqldatabase dbPrefix  MFPRPT,                 server localhost,                 user dbUser,                 password dbUser             driverclasspath                  pathelementlocation  mySQLJarPath                                println Installed warFile file.  codepre

Negative 904 pI have sphinx installed, set up the service and it all works fine. However, I created a user specifically to run the sphinx stuff because, well, gee, I dont really want it running with the highest permissions possible. The user is not in the Administrators group, on purpose. I set up scheduled tasks to run the indexers main and delta  older version until I can upgrade which work  to a point.p  pThe tasks are set up to run as the user I created, and they run, but since the searchd service is running as the local system account, the sphinx user cannot restart the searchd service in order to rotate the indexes.p  pI tried setting the LogOn As for the service to the sphinx user but just keep getting that annoying windows error 1067. I gave the sphinx user full control over any and every sphinx file and directory to no avail.p  pI even tried running the searchd service under the Local Service account  same really annoying error. Anyone have any suggestions as to how I could run the searchd service as something other than SYSTEM and get it to workp

Negative 904 pHey guys ive been having some problems with this problem. I have tried it many ways from looping with stdin and saving each letter to scanf s into an array then declaring the array as a pointer then returning the pointer. I have come close but have mainly had problems when having spaces in my string that I enter. The program needs to call this char that gets the pointer to the string, twice and then output both strings line after line. Any help greatly appreciated.p  precodechar getinput      char c  a     int counter  1     whilec  0              c  getcstdin         char d  charmallocsizeofcharcounter         dcounter  c         counter         return d          return d  codepre  pSo i was thinking something like this was the best way to do it but i dont know how to return the pointer out of the while loop and then again into the char. What i really need is some guidance on the best way to store some input straight into an allocated array that will not waste any memoryit will know how long the string you entered is and allocate enough memory i have also tried with scanfs but i dont know how to stoe the data from scanf into a dynamic memory chunk.p  pAnd sorry dont have my actual code atm cause at work and my program is at home. Any ideas pls p

Negative 904 pI had a problem where my queries were taking an excessively long time to run. After investigation i found the tables were not being maintained. Reindexing hadnt been run in a long time and index fragmentation was over 90 on all relevant tables.p  pSo i reindexed the tables but my query was still taking a very long time. p  pI then manually ran codeEXEC spupdatestatscode After this my query ran very fast. p  pI was under the impression that a Reindex should automatically compute the statistics on the full table and manually running the update stats would only make things worse as it updates the stats based on a sample of data rather than the whole table.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 904 pIm having some issues with SSRS reports parameter date formatting. I have a system that uses the WinForms report viewer in a VB.net system. The server where the reports are processed uses format codeMMddyyyycode and the system uses codeddMMyyyycode. I cant change this or the system as both are required to have those settings. p  pThe issue is that although the calendars are showing the date as codeddMMyyyycode and entering it into the parameter fields in that format the date is still being parsed as codeMMddyyyycode. p  pIf the date is entered as codeMMddyyyycode after the dates are parsed they are switched back to displaying in codeddMMyyyycode which then either fails to parse or parses backward if the user attempts to run the report again.  The reports are standard SSRS 2005 reports using SQL Server 2005 stored procedures.p  pIve set the codeLanguagecode property of the report to codeUserLanguagecode and while this has caused the calendars to set the date in the correct format the parse is still not working correctly.p  pIm using version 8.0.0.0 of Microsoft.ReportViewer.WinForms and .Net 3.5. I can upgrade one or both if need be. The system is running on Windows 7 64 bit.p  pThe regional settings for my computer are set to codeddMMyyyycodep  pAs requested Im adding the .net report code.p  pThis issue affects all reports that have a DateTime parameter.p  pDate parameters are entered into the list as shown.

Negative 904 pSo right now I have a ScrollView, which has a subview called contentView, where I put all of my content. I am not sure if it is a problem with the ScrollView resizing, or the contentview. Basically the way it is setup right now when the viewcontroller loads the application downloads a json file from a server, based on that file the height of the content view should change to accommodate the different amounts of information needed to be displayed. I am using autolayouts NSLayoutConstraint to position all of the views, if that matters.p  pThanksp

Then I make a consult with leftjoin, per each bettypeall leftjoin in 1 consult, and is linked with idevent, the result of my consult return json, and in my html5 I use angularjs for show. Some matches have data for all tables, but other show null in some bettypes, that is okay, because each bettype is specific. strongI am using Angularjs then I need call to database only one time, because I can filter, hide, group, etc on the client sidestrongp  pstrongmy fear is the optimization, I want to know if a consultation like this is fine, because, imagine doing this for 300 games and 60 tables with types of bets.strongp  pI think in create a menu to filter the SportCountryleague and only make the consult for this specific group, to do it, I only used my main tableonly 1 table, but my question is, if many people call multiple times to the database,will occur the same wear or this is the solutionp

Negative 904 h2Givensh2  ul liCSS files must be linked in the head element. Besides it making sense to include linked documents in the head element, this also helps prevent flash of unstyled content.  Their download will block rendering, but not DOM parsing.li liScript tags can also be included in the head element with or without defer or async attributes or near the body closing tags.  For the sake of argument, assume we generally dont put them anywhere else like the middle of the document.li liBrowsers will download only a limited number of remote resources at a time in parallel e.g. six at once, or even as few as two from a single host.  The limits are there to prevent server overloads, which is why sites will often host different parts of a pages content at different hosts, and why you should let Google host your jQuery decreased latency, increased parallelism, and better caching.li ul  h2Unknownsh2  pThe most interesting general question is this. What happens when a browser encounters a script tag in the head element as far as emdownload operationsem are concernedp  pstrongScript Download Prioritystrongp  pFirst of all, we know that it will immediately block DOM parsing not only while it downloads but also while it executes, although modern browsers may may continue parsing and look ahead for other scripts or resources that may need downloading, to get them started as soon as possible. Fortunately, such blocking can be sidestepped with the defer and async attributes on the script tag, and defer will even preserve the script execution order at least in theory, but lo and behold... IE9.p  pAssuming the script in question has the defer attribute, how, if at all, would it impact the download of any CSS files if theyre linked before vs. after the script tagp  pFor example, suppose there are 10 linked stylesheets, followed by a script tag, all in the header and all targeting the same host.  Will the download of that script take precedence over the download of the stylesheets in any way assuming at least one of them are queued for download, or is their download order strictly a matter of when they are encountered  strongIn general, are script downloads prioritized over other content types CSS, images, etc. in any way in any browser for any reasonstrong  As a followup, does their download block any other downloads, even on other hosts  I read that they may.p  pThe implications of any such prioritization are myriad. I asked this question, because I thought putting the script tags in the head with defer could get them downloading as soon as possible, but if the browser prioritizes their download anyway, then theres really no advantage over just putting them at the end, which makes them function like defer anyway.  That would be great news if true, considering we shouldnt put them in the head with defer anyway, thanks to IE9s botched implementation.p

Negative 904 pI am new in learning Android and so far I have been focused on functionality, but now I am starting to work with layouts.p  pIssue My app has a button and on its click, I send a sms to registered number.But as soon as the button is clicked I want change the users phone screen background color to red and same with the front notification led.As soon as the user pushes the button, the app finishes....so my idea is , user should know that button was pushed and message is sent. so the background of scrren should be in alert position.p  pIs there a way to do this I was searching net and found that notification led behaves different for different  manufacturers.Is there any generic way to do this, so that the apps behave same in all android phone brands  Any code snippet or any hits will be highly appreciated.p

problem. When Im setting DataContext only in codeMainWindowcode my codeTextBoxescode are reacting normaly and my codeObservableCollectioncode Items is notified about changes. When I add new Tab it creates normaly with no text in codeTextBoxescode.p  pBut, when I set DataContext in both codeMainWindowcode and codeTabItemViewcode like in code which I added to notify my InvoiceItem codeObservableCollectioncode about changes in codeDataGridcode my DataContext for both codeObservableCollectioncodes are lost, they are no longer notified about changes. When I add new Tab it dublicates data that I added in previous Tabs in both codeTextBoxcodes and codeDataGridcode.p  pAlso when I dont set DataContext in codeMainWindowcode and set it only in codeTabItemViewcode my codeObservableCollectioncode InvoiceItems becomes notified about changes in codeDataGridcode, but when I add new Tab, codeDataGridcodes data just dublicates in each added Tab.p  pWhy is this happening, what Im doing wrong And how can I fix this issues If you need more code or info just say. Im looking for any help in understanding how to solve my problem. Thank you for the answers.p

Negative 904 pI am trying to write up something that takes a lists of IPs from a database, and then retrieves information from the servers, populates an object, and then passes that object to an array. I seem to be able to make each object populate, and that I can tell, its being passed to the array, but when the webpage loads or I do a console log of my array, its always empty. I have reason to believe it has to do with this being written up synchronously. Im still new to asyncsync differences and functionality.

Negative 904 pI could really use some help. Im still pretty new with expect. I need to launch a scp command directly after I run sftp. p  pI got the first portion of this script working, my main concern is the bottom portion. I really need to launch a command after this command completes. Id rather be able to spawn another command than, hack something up like piping this with a sleep command and running it after 10 s or something weird.p  pAny suggestions are greatly appreciatedp  precodespawn sftp userhost expect password  send 123r expect   sleep 2 send cd mydirr expect   sleep 2 send get somefiler expect   sleep 2 send byer expect   sleep 2  spawn scp somefile user2host2homeuser2 sleep 2 codepre  pSo i figured out I can actually get this to launch the subprocess if I use exec instead of spawn.. in other wordsp  precodeexec scp somefile user2host2homeuser2 codepre  pthe only problem It prompts me for a password This shouldnt happen, I already have the sshkeys installed on both systems. In other words, if I run the scp command from the host Im running this expect script on, it will run without prompting me for a password. The system Im trying to scp to, must be recognizing this newly spawned process as a new host, because its not picking up my sshkey. Any ideasp  pBTW, I apologize I havent actually posted a working script, I cant really do that without comprimising the security of this server. I hope that doesnt detract from anyones ability to assist me.p  pI think the problem lies with me not terminating the initially spawned process. I dont understand expect enough to do it properly. If I try close or eof, it simply kills the entire script, which I dont want to do just yet because I still need to scp the file to the second host.p

Negative 904 pI am attempting to lower the font size of a codeTLabelcode if its text is to large to fit in the confines of the label.  I didnt see any properties I could set on the label to achieve this, so I have tried writing my own method.  My method works by using a hrefhttpdocs.embarcadero.comproductsradstudiodelphiAndcpp2009HelpUpdate2ENhtmldelphivclwin32GraphicsTCanvasTextWidth.html relnofollowTCanvas.TextWidtha to measure the width of the text in a label, and shrink the font until the width of the text fits within the width of the label.p  precodevoid fastcall ShrinkFontToFitLabel TCanvas  Canvas, TLabel  Label       float NewFontSize  LabelgtFontgtSize      CanvasgtFontgtFamily  LabelgtFontgtFamily     CanvasgtFontgtSize  NewFontSize      while CanvasgtTextWidth LabelgtText  gt LabelgtWidth ampamp NewFontSize gt MinimumFontSize               NewFontSize  FontSizeDecrement         CanvasgtFontgtSize  NewFontSize           LabelgtFontgtSize  NewFontSize  codepre  pThis works some of the time, however other times it does not shrink the font near enough.  It seems as if the value I get from calling codeCanvasgtTextWidthcode is a lot of times, much smaller than the number of pixels wide the label actually needs to be in order to fit the text.  p  pAm I using codeCanvasgtTextWidthcode incorrectly  Is there a better way to calculate the width of a string, or to resize the font of a codeTLabelcode so its text fits within its demensionsp  pEdit br In this case, I am passing in to my function, the codeTCanvascode that my label is sitting in.  I have tried using that codeTCanvascode as well as codeLabelgtCanvascode. Both  give me the same number for text width, and both are short of the actual value in pixels needed to display the whole string.p

Negative 904 pI have a container view controller with a fixed height view at the top and an embedded UINavigationController below it.
