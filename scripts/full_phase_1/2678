Positive 2678 pIn the last exam I got a very interesting question and I cant find the answer. The question was you have a class. How should you change it when its instance could be allocated only in heap, not in stack. I tried to answer that I should made it as a singletone  private constructor and static instance but it was a wrong answer. Has anybody any ideas about itp
Positive 2678 pI implemented a kernel function and I am having a problem of kernel panic showing page allocation failure or oommanager is getting invoked sometimes killing the process when I try to run my function very huge number of timesotherwise its fine. To debug this I started writing a dummy program which minimally simulates my actual program. My dummy program opens and closes a filethats it  . But I am running this function huge number of times when my module gets loaded as belowp  precodestatic int dummyvoid   struct file fd  mmsegmentt fs  fs  getfs  setfsKERNELDS  fd  filpopenxyza.txt,ORDONLY,0  iffd  ISERRfd     return 1   close file  filpclosefd,0  setfsfs   return 0  codepre  pinit module function called when my kernel module gets loadedp  precodestatic int dummyinitvoid   int i, ret  fori0i lt 10000000i      ret  dummy     ifret  1         return 0       return 0  codepre  pNow when i execute above code i have  page allocation failure or sometimes oommanager is invoked and it kills the process. When I try to reduce the executions  from 107 to 106 there was no problem. So here is the question .. for every iteration just opening a file and closing it using filpclose before function terminates . So I dont understand what is the problem. Moreover I see VFSfilemax limit warnings , hence I increased the limit to very large number. It also doesnt make sense to me why filemax limit is reached though I am closing the file every time. p  pBelow is the stack trace.p  precode[  609.118491] vmtoolsd invoked oomkiller gfpmask0x201da, order0, oomscoreadj0 [  609.120014] vmtoolsd cpusetsessionc2.scope memsallowed0 [  609.121145] CPU 0 PID 2194 Comm vmtoolsd Tainted GF          O 3.10.87 2 [  609.122574] Hardware name VMware, Inc.

Positive 2678 pIm not well versed in MATLAB and was curious about how it handles dynamic memory allocation emunder the hoodemp  pOne primary method is to allocate large chunks and more than is necessary so that you dont have to allocate for each new element added. In doing a bit of research, I saw a lot of people who personally managed their own largechunk allocation assuming they didnt know their final size or did things like creating a maximum size, then trimming. An example is a hrefhttpundocumentedmatlab.comblogarrayresizingperformance relnofollowUndocumented MATLABa which advises you to perform block memory allocation yourself. I would have thought that a language like MATLAB would know to do it itself and I wouldnt be required to concern myself with issues like that. This implies to me if you try to append a single new element on to an array, MATLAB allocates new memory for only that single element, which is horribly inefficient.p  pMy question is twofoldp  ul liFor dynamic arrays, does MATLAB allocate in large chunks, and more memory than is necessary to save on computational efficiency, or does it allocate memory for only what is being concatenatedli liIf the former is the the case, is there a reason MATLAB chose to go with this designli ul

Positive 2678 pI wrote this function that inserts another linked list to the existing linked list. The output is correct when I print out the value of this object in the function. However, the program encounters run time error when the destructor gets invoked in the end.

Based on my calculation on the number of nodes and the amount of space each node takes, it should have taken 40GBs of RAM, but to my surprise it took 70GBs.

After a lot of tests I used some manual memory allocation.

Positive 2678 pWhen memory is low on an android device, the OS can and will begin to kill processes.  Processes not in use background services, and older processes are generally killed first.p  pIs this the only metric that the OS uses to kill processes though or does the OS also consider CPU or battery usage  For example, imagine a system that is not low in memory but is maxing out the cpu.  In this situation, will the OS begin killing processes  If so, will the OS begin to immediately kill processes or is there a delay  For example, if I was maxing out the CPU I would want the OS to kill background processes to free up the CPU but I would not want it to begin to kill foreground processes immediately.  Instead, I would want the OS to wait a period of time before killing more important processes.  I dont know the answers to these questions and I find them quite interesting.  Especially since whenever I read about how the OS handles app management usually only memory considerations are discussed.p

The two part strategy here first measures how much RAM each file would contribute to the sum total, but it also needs to know how much RAM is available to the application at a given point in time.

Positive 2678 pstrongContextstrong I am writing a specific communication protocol to be used between TLM models HW blocks described with SystemC and thus C. TLM notion is not important, just note that this communication is mimicked by allocating objects, the generic payloads gps, that are passed between these C models of HW blocks.p  pstrongAimstrong Together with the protocol, I want to provide a memory manager that should be able to efficiently handle the gps this is quite important since in one simulation lots of gps are emconstructed, used and destroyedem and this can slow down things a lot.

Positive 2678 pI have seen that lot of code bases specially server codes have basic sometimes advanced memory managers. Is the real purpose of memory manager is to reduce number of malloc calls or mainly for the purpose of memory analysis, corruption check or may be other application centric purposes. p  pIs the argument of saving malloc calls reasonable enough as malloc in itself is a memory manager. The only performance gain I can reason is when we know that system always ask for same size memory. p  pOr the reason for having memory manager is that free does not return memory to OS but saves in the list. So over the lifetime of the process, the heap usage of the process may increase if we keep on doing mallocfree because of fragmentation.p

Positive 2678 pMy Understanding on ARM MMU is low and trying to understand how Page table is organised in ARM MMU.p  pPage table is created at system boot up time and can be thought of as linear one dimensional array where each entry is 4 byte long but I dont understand what is 1 MB SECTION corresponds to in Page tablep  pIf we have three level of page table, would our first level page tablePGD contains this 1 MB section or would it 1 MB section be only  part of third level page table PTEp  pAlso what it meant by following statementp  pThe start of the page table is 0x40200000, each entry is 4 bytes long and each entry corresponds to a 1MB section of memory. The first entry in the page table 0x40200000 represents what happens when you try to access memory between the range of 0x00000000 to 0x00100000, the second entry 4 bytes into the table at 0x40200004 represents the memory range 0x00100000 to 0x00200000, etc.p  pTherefore to find the page table associated with area of memory 0x40200000 to 0x402000001MB which is the 402nd MB of memory  you need to traverse the page table list by 402 entries  but each entry is 4 bytes long therefore you need to time this number by 4.p

Positive 2678 pAlright so Im going to try to explain one problem at a time so you can understand the issues Im having and hopefully someone will be able to tell me hoe to fix it. So my app runs perfectly but my users have been complaining of high ram usage and on average it runs any where from 120mb to 200mb IDLE which I agree isnt right so I went ahead and remembered a trick I used in a previous project and that was this line of code androidhardwareAcceleratedfalse. This removes about 10mb of ram per activity but Im still sitting at about 90mb of usage so i went and looked a little harder and found this androidprocessProcessName which takes my app from using 100mb to a mere 8mb of ram. But Im facing a problem while doing this and that is the fact that I have a LocalBroadcastManager in a service activity that sends data to my MainActivity and when these two have different processes they dont communicate with each other, and if I combine them into the same process the usage spikes yet again. So Im kinda stuck what to do at this point and I refuse to use the Android Memory debugger because it doesnt tell me jack crap about what my code is doing wrong. Quite literally I have 5 text views and an imageview inside of my MainActivity so I know its not that intensive by any means If anyone needs code please let me know but I figured someone really didnt need to look at the code to answer thisp
Positive 2678 pstrongFirst, some backgroundstrongp  pIm working on a project which requires me to simulate interactions between objects that can be thought of as polygons usually triangles or quadrilaterals, almost certainly fewer than seven sides, each side of which is composed of the radius of two circles with a variable and possibly zero number of rivers of various constant widths passing between them, and out of the polygon through some other side. As these rivers and circles and their widths and the positions of the circles are specified at runtime, one of these polygons with N sides and M rivers running through it can be completely described by an array of N2M pointers, each referring to the relevant riverscircles, starting from an arbitrary corner of the polygon and passing around in principal, since rivers cant overlap, they should be specifiable with less data, but in practice Im not sure how to implement that.p  pI was originally programming this in Python, but quickly found that for more complex arrangements performance was unacceptably slow. In porting this over to C chosen because of its portability and compatibility with SDL, which Im using to render the result once optimization is complete I am at somewhat of a loss as to how to deal with the polygon structure.p  pThe obvious thing to do is to make a class for them, but as C lacks even runtimesized arrays or multitype arrays, the only way to do this would be with a ludicrously cumbersome set of vectors describing the list of circles, rivers, and their relative placement, or else an even more cumbersome edge class of some kind. Rather than this, it seems like the better option is to use a much simpler, though still annoying, vector of void pointers, each pointing to the riverscircles as described above.p  pstrongNow, the questionstrongp  pIf I am correct, the proper way to handle the relevant memory allocations here with the minimum amount of confusion not saying much... is something like thisp  precodeint doStuffWithPolygons     stdvectorltstdvectorltVoid gtgt polygons     whilesome circles arent assigned a polygon         stdvectorltVoid gt polygon         void start  ampnext circle that has not yet been assigned a polygon         void lastcircle  start         void nextcircle         nextcircle  ampnext circle to put into the polygon         whilenextcircle  start             polygon.pushbacklastcircle             stdvectorltRiver gt rivers  list of rivers between last circle and next circle             forunsigned i  0 i lt rivers.size i                 polygon.pushbackrivers[i]             lastcircle  nextcircle             nextcircle  ampnext circle to put into the polygon         polygons.pushbackpolygon      int score  0     do whatever youre going to do to evaluate the polygons here     return score   int main     int bestscore  0     stdvectorltintgt bestarrangement contains position of each circle     stdvectorltintgt currentarrangement  whatever arbitrary starting arrangement is appropriate     whilenot done evaluating polygon configurations         fiddle with current arrangement a bit         int currentscore  doStuffWithPolygons         ifcurrentscore gt bestscore             bestscore  currentscore             bestarrangement  currentarrangement      somehow report what the best arrangement is      return 0  codepre  pIf I properly understand how this stuff is handled, I shouldnt need any delete or .clear calls because everything goes out of scope after the function call. Am I correct about this Also, is there any part of the above that is needlessly complex, or else is insufficiently complex Am I right in thinking that this is as simple as C will let me make it, or is there some way to avoid some of the roundabout constructionp  pAnd if youre response is going to be something like dont use void pointers or just make a polygon class, unless you can explain how it will make the problem strongsimplerstrong, save yourself the trouble. I am the only one who will ever see this code, so I dont care about adhering to best practices.

Negative 2678 pall, I have a rather frustrating issue.  The application in question has an MFC GUI that uses the classes available in the MFC Featurepack.  This GUI uses an DLL that is developed in CCLI.  Our company uses Cruise Control. NET 1.4.4 SP1 on Windows Server 2008 SP2 for continuous integration. Cruise Control is setup to use the version of MSBuild that comes with the 3.5 version on the framework.p  pThe issue in question is that if I use the build that Cruise Controls creates, I receive the following error Unhandled exception at 0x7642fbae kernel32.dll in FormView.exe 0xE0434F4D 0xe0434f4d.  After some digging, the issue seems to be that the GUI doesnt like the CCLI assembly.p  pThe gotcha is that if I log on to the server, and, using PowerShell, execute the same MSBuild command, the build works.

Negative 2678 pIve written an application for use offline with Google Gears on devices using IE Mobile. The devices are experiencing memory leaks at such a rate that the device becomes unusable over time.p  pThe problem page fetches entries from the local Gears database and renders a table of each entry with a link in the last column of each row to open the entry  the link is just onclickopenmyID . When theyve done with the entry they return to the table, which is RErendered. Its the repeated building of this table that appears to be the problem. Mainly the onclick events.p  pThe table is generated in essence like thisp  precodevar tmp for var i0 ilt100 i  tmplttrgtlttdgtrow ilttdgtlttdgtlta href idLINKi    onclickafunctionreturn falsegtlinkltagtlttdgtlttrgt   document.getElementByIdview.innerHTML  lttablegttmplttablegt codepre  pIve read up on common causes of memory leaks and tried setting the onclick event for each link to null before rerendering the table but it still seems to leak.p  pAnybody got any ideasp  pIn case it matters, the function being called from each link looks like thisp  precodefunction afunction  document.getElementByIdview.style.displaynone  codepre  pWould that constitute a circular reference in any wayp  pJakep

Negative 2678 pProblem  I have a large collection of points.  Each of these points has a list with references to other points with the distance between them already calculated and stored.

Negative 2678 por a VB6  compatible  collection object.p  pWe provide hooks into our .net products through a set of APIs.p  pWe need to continue to support customers that call our APIs from VB6, so we need to continue supporting VB6 collection objects simple with VBA.Collection in .net.p  pThe problem is supporting some sites that use VBScript to call our APIs. VBScript has no concept of a collection object, so to create a collection object to pass to our API we built a VB6 ActiveX DLL that provides a CreateCollection method. This method simply creates and passes back a new collection object. Problem solved.p  pAfter many years of pruning, porting and rebuilding, this DLL is the only VB6 code we have. Because of it we still need to install Visual Studio 6 on our Dev amp build Machines.p  pIm not happy with our reliance on this DLL for several reasons my personal dislike of VB6 is not one of them. Top of the list is that Microsoft no longer support Visual Studio 6.p  pMy question is, how do I get ATL to create a collection object that implements the same interface as the VB6 collection object.p  pIve a good handle on C, but only a loose grasp of ATL  I can create simple objects and implement simple methods, but this is beyond me.p

Negative 2678 pI need to put some ListView populate code in a thread. For the simple case, this thread should not run twice. When I want to issue a new thread the previous needs to stop, whatever did.p  pstrongEDIT 1strongp  pThe scenario is the following.br I have a textual filter above the ListView. On textchange I call a populateList method.br The problem is that the code can take longer as it uses SQL codeLIKEcode syntax on a larger database. p  pUntil this runs, the user cannot type in nothing. So there are sever hangouts while you type in abc, you get to type c after 10 seconds only.p  pSo I have in mind to issue the populateList method in a Thread and allow the user to quickly type in something more. The longer the text the slower takes the SQL query. In the abc situation if you type a code goes behind and runs the query, but meanwhile if the user pressed b I want to stop the execution of the a thread, and issue a new one, now using ab... and so on with the c.p  pstrongEDIT 2strongp  pStill looking for more answers.p

Negative 2678 pI have an outlook addin that I have been developing for some time now, and am experiencing a problem. If I have a computer with two administrator users call them User A and User B,  the addin installs and runs just fine as long as the same user tries to run it.

If User B cancels out of the install, he can then go and use the addin just fine.p  pRight now, I use offices a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.commshneerarchive20070904deployingyourvstoaddintoallusersparti.aspx relnofollowregistry key propagationa to do an all users install, and I inspected the registry for any duplications and found none.

Taking Microcomputer CPU PC architecture as reference and comparing it to others we havep  pstrongEmbedded CPU architecturestrongp  ul liThey are a completely new world.li liEmbedded systems are emsmall amp do very specific task mostly real time amp low power consumingem so we do not need so many amp such wide registers available in a microcomputer CPU typical PC.

Hence new architecture amp new instruction  RISC.li liThe above point also clarifies why do we need a separate operating system RTOS.li ul  pstrongWorkstationServer CPU architecturesstrongp  ul liI dont know what is a workstation. Someone clarify regarding the workstation. li liAs of the server. It is dedicated to run a specific software server software like httpd, mysql etc.. Even if other processes run we need to give server process priority therefore there is a need for new scheduling scheme and thus we need operating system different than general purpose one. If you have any more points for the need of server OS please mention. li liBut I dont get why do we need a new CPU Architecture. Why cant Microcomputer CPU architecture do the job.

Negative 2678 pWith several forms of mine, I occasionally run into the following issue I edit the form using the designer Visual Studio 2008, Windows Forms, .NET 2.0, VB.NET to add components, only to find out later that some minor adjustments were made e.g. the forms size is suddenly changed by a few pixels, and controls get deleted. This happens silently  eventhandling methods automatically have their codeHandlescode suffix removed, too, so they never get called, and theres no compiler error. I only notice much later or not at all, because Im working on a different area in the form.p  pAs an example, I have a form with a codeSplitContainercode containing an Infragistics codeUltraListViewcode to the left, and an codeUltraTabControlcode to the right. I added a new tab, and controls within, and they worked fine. I later on found out that the list views scrollbar was suddenly invisible, due to its size being off, and at least one control was removed from a different tab that I hadnt been working on.p  pIs this a known issue with the WinForms Designer, or with Infragistics I use version control, of course, so I can compare the changes and merge the deleted code back in, but its a tedious process that shouldnt be necessary. Are there ways to avoid this Is there a good reason for this to occurp  pOne clue is that the control that was removed may have code such as a codeLoadcode event handler that expects to be run in run time, not design time, and may be throwing an exception. Could this cause Visual Studio to remove the controlp

Negative 2678 pThis is a very common problem when Excel Worksheet or Chart is embedded into Word or Powerpoint. I am seeing this problem in both Word and Powerpoint and the reason it seems is the COM addin attached to Excel. The COM addin is written in C .NET. See the attached images for error dialogs.p  pI debugged the addin and found a very strange behavior. The OnConnection..., OnDisConnection... etc methods in the COM addin works fine until I add an event handler to the code. i.e. handle the WorksheetSheetChange, SelectionChange or any similar event available in Excel. As soon as I add even a single event handler though my code has several, Word and Powerpoint start complaining and do not Activate the embedded object.p  pOn some of the posts on the internet, people have been asked to remove the antivirus addins for office none in my case so this makes me believe that the problem is somewhat related to COM addins which are loaded when the host app activates the object.p  pDoes anyone have any idea of whats happening hereimg srchttpwww.freeimagehosting.netuploadsd687736c66.png altPowerPoint Errorp  pimg srchttpwww.freeimagehosting.netuploadsf72b99bc25.png altWord Errorp  pbUPDATED 21JUNE2010b hr Found out that both Events and changes to ComAddIns collection creates problems when the embedded object is activated. I have now used the ExcelApplicationUserControl property to check whether Excel is in embedded state and then skip any OnConnection... and OnDisconnection... code.p  pOne solution to Events problem can be to move all the application level events to VBA code and call into .NET. Thereby removing all event handlers from .NET code.p  pThere may be even more scenarios where an embedded object might fail to initialize so I choose to disable the COM addin i.e. skip the code in OnConnection... and OnDisconnection... methods altogether.p

Negative 2678 pA quick question of perhaps a more speculative nature.  Ive been getting heavy into jquery lately to handle all the ajax in my web apps.p  pRight now Im building a bidding system in PHP that makes heavy use of modrewrite.  Im using jQuery with a confirm dialog to send an Ajax request that will spend some of the users predeposited credits on a bid.  The ajax request to spend is sent with the cost as a post parameter to a PHP controller that spends the users credits and then echos the output, which jQuery then places back into the document.p  pIts working fine, but what Im wondering is if there is a better way to make jQuery handle the refusal of the purchase if the user has insufficient credits.  Right now I have the php answering with an echo that displays this message with a link to the make a deposit page... but Id rather have a redirect happen automatically.p  pIs there some way my jQuery script could be notified with the boolean of success or failure before .load finishes, and then redirect in the case of failure  Possibly through HTTP headers determining the handling  The only way I could think of is to place a true or false in an html element that gets check in the callback after .load and in the case of a false perform a redirect.p  pThanks and sorry for the explanation length.p

Negative 2678 pPlease note that I dont want to solve any problem with my question  I was thinking about probabilities of things to happen and thus was wondering about somethingp  pstrongWhat exactly happens if you delete on object and use gcc as compilerstrongp  pLast week I was investigating a crash, where a race condition lead to an double delete of an object.p  pThe crash occured when calling the virtual destructor of the object, because the pointer to the virtual function table already was overwritten.p  pIs the virtual function pointer overwritten by the first deletep  pIf not, is the second delete safe then, as long as no new memory allocation is made in the meantimep  pIm wondering why the problem I had was not recognized before and the only exlanation is that either the virtual function table is overwritten immediatly during the first delete or the second delete does not crash.p  pemThe first means that the crash always occurs on the same location if the race happens  the second one, that usually nothing happens when the race happens  and only if a third thread overwrites the delete object in the meantime the problem occurs.emp  hr  pstrongEditUpdatestrongp  pI did a test, the following code crashes with a segfault gcc 4.4, i686 and amd64p  precodeclass M  private   int ptr public   M    ptr  new int[1]      virtual M delete ptr   int mainint argc, char argv    M ptr  new M   delete ptr   delete ptr  codepre  pIf I remove the virtual from the dtor, the program is aborted by glibc because it detects the doublefree. With the virtual the crash occurs when doing the indirect function call to the destructor, because the pointer to the virtual function table is invalid.p  pOn both amd64 and i686 the pointer points to a valid memory region heap, but the value there is invalid a counter Its very low, e.g 0x11, or 0x21 so the call or jmp when the compiler did a returnoptimization jumps to an invalid region.p  blockquote   pProgram received signal SIGSEGV,p      pSegmentation fault.   0x0000000000000021p      pin   gdb p      pcodecode0  0x0000000000000021 in  p      pcodecode1  0x000000000040083e in main p blockquote  pSo with the above mentioned conditions, the pointer to the virtual function table is ALWAYS overwritten by the first delete, so the next delete will jump to nirvana if the class has a virtual destructor.p
Negative 2678 pI have a very simple image upload web app. Theres only upload and image crop. Everything worked fine. I have not made any changes to the code or anything. Today I visit my site and the submit button has vanished. I thought maybe I was hacked. I tried the version of my site that I have on my own machine running in IIS and the button is also missing. How could the submit button just vanish I even tested other versions of my site I had saved and stored in rar files on my computer. Any idea of what happened The web page is a .aspx page.

Now Id maybe believe someone gained access to my server and did this as a joke but I also tested my site running in IIS on my own computer and I still got the same result. No submit button.

Negative 2678 pThis is AFAIK a specific question within a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2390354wherecanifindsoftmultiplyanddividealgorithmsthis general topica.p  pHeres the situationp  pI have an embedded system a video game console based on a 32bit RISC microcontroller a variant of NECs V810. I want to write a fixedpoint math library. I read a hrefhttpwww.gameprogrammer.com4fixed.html relnofollowthis articlea, but the accompanying source code is written in 386 assembly, so its neither directly usable nor easily modifiable.p  pThe V810 has builtin integer multiplydivide, but I want to use the 18.14 format mentioned in the above article. This requires dividing a 64bit int by a 32bit int, and the V810 only does signed or unsigned 32bit32bit division which produces a 32bit quotient and a 32bit remainder.p  pSo, my question is how do I simulate a 64bit32bit divide with a 32bit32bit one to allow for the preshifting of the dividend Or, to look at the problem from another way, whats the best way to divide an 18.14 fixedpoint by another using standard 32bit arithmeticlogic operations best meaning fastest, smallest, or both.p  pAlgebra, V810 assembly, and pseudocode are all fine. I will be calling the code from C.p  pThanks in advancep  pEDIT Somehow I missed a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1870158unsigned128bitdivisionon64bitmachinethis questiona... However, it will still need some modification to be superefficient it has to be faster than the floatingpoint div provided by the v810, though it may already be..., so feel free to do my work for me in exchange for reputation points  and credit in my library documentation, of course.p

Negative 2678 pI am currently busy with a project where the main focus of the application is to be extensible allow 3rd party developers to write plugins  their own implementations of interfaces.p  pUntil now, I have been using Java, and built the application on the NetBeans platform. This has works perfectly fine and is quite easy to implement.p  pHowever, the program is quite computationally intense, and must be run on a grid of computers. I think C might be better suited for massive computations like I need.p  pWhat I would like to know. Is there any libraries emlikeem the NetBeans platform for C. Or would I have to implement everything from scratch not that I mind, I just wat to know Also, how easy is it to write extensible code with C and implement something like an update center This is stuff you get for free with the NetBeans platform. My experience with the using the platform is that it allows you to write very modular code, which is something I like. New modules can be installed independantly, while the platform provides discovery of services to find all the installed plugins  impementations.p  pCan this be done similarly in Cp  pThanksp

Negative 2678 pIve got a solution in source control with multiple projects.  When I first migrated old code to TFS, I created main, dev, release areas for branches.

Negative 2678 pAssume we build an object to represent some network social, wireless, whatever. So we have some node object to represent the KIND of network, different nodes might have different behaviors and so forth.

So somewhere, there has to be a list, per node, of all of the neighbors of that nodeor such a list has to be generated on the fly whenever it is needed.

Negative 2678 pI was wondering if there was a way to select different versions of the same jar at runtime. I am hoping to avoid using maven profiles since this would be a buildtime selection.p  pLets say there are two versions of the same jar p  pcodegreatFeatureversionA.jarcode codegreatFeatureversionB.jarcodep  pMy initial idea was to use JMX to create a basic runtime toggle selecting between those two jars which are both included in the classpath. Also, the contents of the two jars are the same no versioning or different naming of the internal classes.p  pSo when a class is requested, lets say from versionA, the class loader will always select the first one it finds, regardless of which jar it belongs to. p  pMy thinking is that no effective runtime toggling can be achieved this way.

Negative 2678 pThe basic question is using data binding what are the ways you can allow the user to select the subclass to do the jobp  pSpecific example. I have a class that accepts a CalculationMethod interface to do the calculation. There are several implementations of CalculationMethod. The GUI developer wants to only use data binding to present the choices to the user.p  pI have taken a few approaches. p  pEasiest is to create a class that returns a listof CalcuationMethod for all the implementations and add a Name property to CalculationMethod for display purposes.p  pExpanding on that I will sometimes create a class that uses reflection to do the same thing finds all the classes that implement CalculationMethod. This way I dont have to remember to add new implementations but it can be bad in web applications it is expensive or environments that dont allow reflection.p  pAt times I have added an enumeration with each enum representing an implementation. There is a factory method that accepts the enumeration and returns the proper implementation. This way the GUI developer can bind to the enumeration. I often do this if the user selection must be persisted in some way.p  pAll the above have advantages and disadvantages. Are there other andor better ways to do thisp  pExample below. The GUI developer would bind the dropdown or whatever to the CalculationOptions.Calculations allowing the user to select. I wont write the other examples because you should get the idea. I would use reflection to get all the classes that inherit CalculatoinTemplate or I would have an enum that represents all the classes that inherit.p  precodePublic Class CalculationTemplate     Public MustOverride Readonly Property Name as string     Public MustOverride Sub Calculate End Class  Public Class CalculationImp1     Public Overrides Sub Calculate     End Sub     Public Overrides Readonly Property Name as String         Get             Return Imp1          End Get     End Property End Class  Public Class CalculationImp2     Public Overrides Sub Calculate     End Sub     Public Overrides Readonly Property Name as String        Get            Return Imp2        End Get     End Property End Class  Public Class CalculationOptions    Public Shared Function Calculations as ListOf CalculationTemplate        Dim lst as New ListOf CalculationTemplate        lst.addnew CalculationImp1        lst.addnew CalculationImp2        Return lst    End Function End Class codepre

For an example if I create an event 7 July 2011 which is Thursday and If I choose repeat monthly it should create next event on 4 Aug 2011 which is also Thursday. But I could not find a way to repeat at the same day of month. It only works for the same date such as if I choose 7 July, it will create 7th August. I cant think of a way to check the day. Please find my query below.p  precodeINSERT INTO EVENTname, date, usr, repfrequent VALUES test, DATEADD201187, INTERVAL 1 MONTH, Monthly codepre  pThe above query repeats the event same date of next month instead of the day such as Thursday of next month. Please let me know if any one knows the answer.p

Negative 2678 pI build an application on a machine running Linux Debian with kernel 2.6.262amd64 and I want to run this application on another machine running Linux Suse with kernel 2.6.16.600.21smp but I get the error FATAL kernel too old.p  pI know from research on the internet that this can happen when building against a glibc library that was not compiled to support older kernel versions, but it usually concerns version 2.4. Is it possible to get such errors for kernel of the same series 2.6 or can this be from something else p  pAdditionally I read that the solution to this problem is to rebuild the application against another version of glibc compiled with appropriate enablekernelVERSION option.

Negative 2678 pIm building a web application with GWT and I want to give users the ability to extend its functionality by some sort of Javascript API that would interact with the app core written in GWT. Basically, this JS API would map to some of my GWT internal methods that would do the actual job.p  pSo, to achieve this, i read on GWT JSNI official documentation a trick that consists in creating a global JS variable from GWT and assigning it a call to the actual GWT method. Then i would make the call in my handwritten JS code through this variable. p  pUnfortunately I couldnt make it to work the example contained syntax errors son im not sure that it has even been tested. Doing more research, i found on this site a similar solution that assigns the JS var an anonymous function that makes the call. It looks like this p  precodeGWT code that assigns the anonymous function  private static native void loadWrapper      wnd.showMessage          entrycom.Glob3Mobile.client.TestApimsgBox   public static void msgBox      Window.alerthello  codepre  pThis solution looks promising but I havent been able to make it to work. When i do window.showMessage in my handwritten JS code it wont work. I have found these issuesp  ul liwindow.showMessage seems to be created but JS console says that its not a function, even though i inspected the dom tree and verified that the variable does contains a function.li liIt seems like I always have to append the window. preffix, since the var is being created within the window object. This is a considerably concerning issue, cause forcing users to write like this every time they want to call a function is really tedious. li ul  pIf anybody knows the solution to these issues or an alternative approach to achieve what im trying to do, id be very grateful to hear. Thanks in advance.p

Negative 2678 pI was looking at the vignette a hrefhttpcran.rproject.orgwebpackagesDEoptimvignettesDEoptimPortfolioOptimization.pdf relnofollowLargescale portfolio optimization with DEoptima. The vignette applies genetic algorithms to solve nonconvex optimization problems.p  pMy question was on interpreting the parameter F stepsize. The documentation reads F stepsize from interval [0,2]. Default to .8. In the machine learning literature for gradientbased decent methods, stepsize refers to the amount that the choice vector is tweaked in the direction of maximal descent. Large steps imply faster convergence but less precision.p  pThe vignette casestudy involves portfolio optimization. The stepsize is not specified as an argument so the stepsize of .8 is always used. However, since the optimization is finding what weights minimize some portfolio objective, and since weights must sum to 1, it seems that a stepsize of .8 80 of the portfolio is much to large for this problem. A better choice of stepsize might be .01. p  pHowever, I must be missing something since when I run an optimization I can see in each generation the weights are not jumping by .8 each time. So what is the interpretation of stepsize In the context of portfolio optimization does it makes sense to set this value to a small value such as .01 1p

Negative 2678 pI am a programmer on an MVCajax project that receives significant traffic from its customers. Weve been seeing one or two isolated instances per day of a controller action not receiving parameters from the client.p  pLong story short the actions are being called via jQuery ajax, and the action params are only null if the ajax call is made while the browser is navigating to another page. IE click a link and then trigger an ajax call.p  pI added some crude validation around these calls to ensure that we arent actually passing nulls in the ajax data, and this hasnt alleviated the problem. An example of one of the calls is below.p  precode    var searchValue  txtSearch.val.trim      if searchValue  null           searchValue  undefined           searchValue.length lt minimumLengthForSearch          txtSearch.focus         return           clear out the value when launching     txtSearch.val      .postquickSearchUrl,          searchString searchValue ,         function data ...,     json codepre  pI found a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.combiearchive20080714ie8ajaxnavigation.aspx relnofollowan old IEBlog posta that suggests IE might handle this situation differently from other browsers. I was curious as to whether anyone else has encountered this phenomena before. Again, I can only reproduce this issue in IE and only during page navigation.p  pEdit It is difficult to reproduce this exception with Fiddler active for some reason, but when I manage to Fiddler displays the following error message p  pFiddler has detected a protocol violation in session 4.

Negative 2678 pAssume that I have some array of data a vector to be specific. Can I plot it element by element sequentially using Gnuplot such that it seems as if it is a real life signal that is being traced through a monitorp  pI know that I can write the whole data into a text file using Common Lisp, then using gnuplot I can plot it in a batch format. What I require is that I want to put a point on my plot as data comes sequentially.p  pData will probably be generated inside a loop, thus you may consider xaxis as the integer valued discretetime axis. So in the loop if the first element of the array is generated as 5, I would like to put a point on my plot to 0,5. Then if the second element is generated as 3, I would like to put another point on my plot to 1,7 preserving the old data point. So as I iterate through the loop, I plot the data sequentially.p  pI am using emacs and Common Lisp for my purposes and I want to plot this data staying within these tools. If there are any other options other than Gnuplot, I would like to hear them.p  pIf this is not easily possible, it would be cool, if I can run a Gnuplot command file by some Common Lisp command. p  peditp  pFollowing advices people gave under this thread, I wrote a code using codecgncode which uses codeltkcode.br Right now I open two x11 windows at prespecified positions on my screen and I enter the loop. In loop each time I open a stream and write the data sine and cosine waves of 0.25 Hz sampled at 20 Hz to the text file trial.txt with the codeifexists appendcode option and close the stream. Then at each iteration I plot the whole data using the gnuplot through the codeformatgnuplotcode command. This code gives me two windows of prespecified x and y ranges and then one can watch the evolutions of aforementioned sine and cosine waves in the windows.br As I have stated before I dont have strong programming background I am an electrical engineer who somehow ended using common lisp and I am pretty sure that my code is nonoptimal and unelegant.

Negative 2678 pAn argument in favor of JITed languages such as C and Java is that they can perform optimizations better since runtime profiling by the virtual machine can optimize code better than statically optimized code of C. p  pHowever, I was wondering if we could also use a virtual machine to optimize code at runtime for C, or rather any similar language. For example, we could take the IR generated by the LLVM compiler and make a virtual machine that interprets, JIT and optimize code, similarly as in case of Java and C. p  pOfcourse, there would be no garbage collection, but the optimization factor would be there. Has anyone worked on this. Are there any papers, tools on this How good will this approach bep

Now, Ive my task is to make an administration application that all of those subdivisions will be using they all perform the same tasks, they are just divided because of their geographical locations and some legal regulations that are not important for my question. So, my problem is how to make an application that will be able to switch between databases. Usually, I could do it by creating a WinForm that would contain fields for input e.g textBoxes or comboBoxes where user could choose which connection to use, but I have a problem with this approach because of reports that these applications have to generate. Up until now Ive been working with .rdlc reports that use datasets created by TableAdapters. So if I create a dataset programmaticaly, I dont know how to generate a report. But, if I create report based on a TableAdapters dataset, I dont know how to change TableAdapters connection string except for duplicating TableAdapters so each one uses another connection string but that is not efficient at all. Im using C to create WinForms and SQL to work with databases. Please help me with this problem. Thanksp

Negative 2678 pIm trying to write an Android activity instrumentation test that stops codeonPausecode, then codeonStopcode and restarts the current activity.

Negative 2678 pIm trying to write a C program using Opencv library that will reconstruct 3d points from the corresponding 2d markers placed on human model.p  pBut Ive a question. How do commercial mocapmotion capture industry figure out which markers belong to which bone structure p  pWhat I mean by my last question is lets suppose there are three markers placed on left upper arm. What method do they use to associate these three markers to left upper arm from frame to frame p  pBecause it could belong to right upper arm right or to any bones like front chest, femur etc. p  pSo what process do they implement to differentiate between markers and place the right marker to proper bone structurep  pDo they use optical flow, SIFT to track markers where in frame1 the markers are labelled for proper bones But even if the mocap industry use this method, arent these two methods very time consuming I saw a video on youtube. And there they associate and reconstruct markers in realtime. p  pIs it possible to kindly tell me what procedure commercial mocap industry follow to correspond points to individual parts of skeleton structure p  pAfter all you need to do this because you have to write the xRot, yRot and zRotrotation about xyz axis of bones in .bvh file so that you can view the 2d motion in 3d.p  pSo whats the secretp

Negative 2678 pThis is an OS X application.  I am designing a custom sheet.  Within my XIB file I have the sheets window and a subclass of NSViewController which is responsible for controlling the views within the windowsheet.  The owner of the XIB is another controller class.p  pI placed an NSTextField into the windows content view.  In my NSViewController I created an IBOutlet declaration for the NSTextField and ensured the outlet was properly connected in the XIB.p  pI overrode [NSViewController setRepresentedObject] and within that method I am looking at the representedObject and depending on its properties I am either removing the NSTextField from its superview or Im adding it back into the superview.p  pThe first time I display my sheet with a representedObject that dictates the textfield should be removed from the superview.  This works just fine.p  pThe second time I display my sheet with a representedObject that dictates the textfield should be added back to the superview my application crashes with EXCBADACCESS when calling [NSView addSubview].p  pRunning Instruments shows that the NSTextField was a Zombie at the time I tried to add it back to the superview.  Instruments also indicates that every call to retainreleaseautorelease was performed by either AppKit or Foundation  so at no point does any of my code increase or decrease the retain count.  In fact the only two lines that reference the IBOutlet in my code are a call to [NSView removeFromSuperview] and [NSView addSubview].p  pAm I doing something wrong or is this a bug in OS X  An IBOutlet should never be deallocated unless the XIB is unloaded.p

Negative 2678 pIve recently added GCM messaging to my app using googles helper classes GCMBroadcastReceiver, GCMBaseIntentService.  It works beautifully when the app is running, both when its in the foreground and when its not.  However, when its not running, nothing works.p  pAs a test, I extended GCMBroadcastReceiver and added log statements to getGCMIntentServiceClassName and peekService.  When the app is running and a message arrives I see the former called.  The OS then instantiates my service class, which eventually results in onMessage being called.p  pWhen the app isnt running getGCMIntentServiceClassName never gets called.p  pMy manifest is pretty much the boilerplate code from Googles GCM examples.p  pIs there an extra permission or flag I need to set in order for the OS to wake up my app when its not running and a message arrives w the correct intent category  My receiver is defined asp  precodeltreceiver     androidname.GCMBroadcastReceiver     androidpermissioncom.google.android.c2dm.permission.SEND gt     ltintentfiltergt         ltaction androidnamecom.google.android.c2dm.intent.RECEIVE gt         ltaction androidnamecom.google.android.c2dm.intent.REGISTRATION gt          ltcategory androidnamePACKAGENAME gt     ltintentfiltergt ltreceivergt codepre  pBear in mind  this works when the app is running in the background.p

Negative 2678 pI have a Mono for Android application that reads XML files using the .NET strongXmlDocumentstrong class.  Each document is about 180K.p  pAfter parsing each document and creating my own internal data structures, I leave no references to the strongXmlDocumentstrong instance, so it becomes eligible for garbage collection.p  pThe problem is, though, that it takes 56 seconds before that collection happens, and if I load multiple documents within 56 seconds, my app crashes out to the OS with no error messages printed, no exceptions thrown, etc.  It just says that thread 12 exited Im not creating any extra threads, so I dont understand why its thread 12 either  XmlDocuments thread.p  pIf I load document 1, then wait 5 seconds, then load document 2, wait 5 seconds then load document 3, etc., then everything is OK.p  pIn that case, during the 5 second wait, I can see the GC kicking in several times and releasing around 1MB of memory in total across 45 cycles some marked EXPLICIT, some marked CONCURRENT.p  pI also tried adding a call to xmlDocument.RemoveAll once I am done as suggested by an article I found.

Negative 2678 pIve been working on building several classes which inherit from one base class but Im not entirely confident on how inheritance and polymorphism work in C at this stage.p  pMy base class looks like thisp  precodeabstract class Structure              public int currentCost  0         public int currentArea  0         public int currentPopulation  0         public int currentConstruction  0         public int currentEnergy  0         public int currentEconomy  0          public abstract int baseCost  get          public abstract int baseEnergy  get          public abstract int baseEconomy  get          public abstract int baseConstruction  get          public int baseArea  1         public int basePopulation  1          public int level  0         public abstract string structureName  get   codepre  pNow, classes that inherit from the codeStructurecode class will be made to provide their own assignments for the abstract variables which is fine as most of the classes vary wildly in the figures they assign.

What I would prefer is a way to provide a value in the base class and provide an override in a derived class if needed. p  pIs there a way to do this I know that this can be done with methods declared codevirtualcode. This allows the derived class to use the base classes method unless it provides one of its own. Surely a similar thing exists for thisp

Negative 2678 pIm attempting to write a manager in Perl to automate a bioinformatics pipeline my lab has been using. The REPET pipeline, for anyone whos interested. The pipeline has eight steps, several of which are broken down into substeps which can be run in parallel.  Most notably, step 3 is broken down into three parts, and step 4 into three corresponding parts.  Each part of step 3 can be run independently, and its corresponding part in step 4 can be started as soon as its step 3 companion is finished.  Id like my manager to be able to launch step 3 in three parallel threads, and, for each thread, move on to step 4 as soon as step 3 is finished.  The best way I can think to do that is to monitor the output of each process. The output from each step looks like thisp  precodeSTART TEdenovo.py 20120823 112010 version 2.0 project name  dm3chr2L project directory  homeltetcgt beginning of step 1 submitting jobs with groupid dm3chr2LTEdenovoprepareBatches 20120823 112010 waiting for 1 jobs with groupid dm3chr2LTEdenovoprepareBatches 20120823 112010 execution time per job n1 mean2.995 var0.000 sd0.000 min2.995 med2.995 max2.995 step 1 finished successfully version 2.0 END TEdenovo.py 20120823 112025 codepre  pThats the output for step 1, but in step 3, when step 3 finished successfully appears in the output, its safe to move on to step 4. The problem has been successfully tabulating the output for three of these processes as they run at once. Essentially, this is the behavior that I want pseudocodep  precodemy log31  TEdenovo.py [options] amp my log32  TEdenovo.py [options] amp my log33  TEdenovo.py [options] amp  while1      start step 41 if log31  step 3 finished successfully     start step 42 if log32  step 3 finished successfully     start step 43 if log33  step 3 finished successfully     monitor logs 41, 42, 43 similarly     last if all logs read finished successfully     sleep5   move on to step 5 codepre  pThe problem is that evoking a process with backticks causes perl to wait until that process has finished to move on as I discovered, it isnt like with system, where you can spin something into a background process with amp and then proceed immediately. As far as I know, there isnt a good way to use system to get the effect Im looking for. I suppose I could do thisp  precodesystemTEdenovo.py [options] amp gt log31.txt codepre  pAnd then poll log31.txt periodically to see whether finished successfully has appeared, but that seems unecessarily messy.p  pIve also tried opening the process in a filehandlep  precodeopenmy step3, TEdenovo.py [options]  my log3  while1      pushlog3, ltstep3gt     last if grepstep 3 finished successfully, log3     sleep5  codepre  p...but, once again, Perl waits until the process has finished in order to move on in this case, at the push. I tried the above with  both set and unset.p  pSo, the essence of my question is Is there a way to capture the standard output of a running background process in perlp

Negative 2678 pIn Java I have an abstract base class, lets say codeWrapXcode, which contains a property of a type, say codeXcode think Decorator DP. This class presents a method to call a specific method on the encapsulated codeXcodep  precodepublic abstract class WrapX    protected X instance    public WrapXX x      this.instance  x       public void foo        instance.foo       public class X      public void foo        System.out.printlnfoo      codepre  pThere is then a class called codeYcode that extends from codeXcode and provides an additional methodp  precodepublic class Y extends X     public void bar      System.out.printlnbar     codepre  pThen naturally I have created codeWrapYcode that can be used as a decorated type over the type codeYcodep  precodepublic class WrapY extends WrapX    ...    public void bar     instance.bar      codepre  pSo herein lies the issue. codeWrapYcode has inherited the codeinstancecode property of type codeXcode from its parent codeWrapXcode. As far as Eclipse is concerned, codeinstancecode is of type codeXcode and so will complain that it contains no method code.barcode. p  pFair enough of course, but how then in this subclass can we implicitly cast the codeinstancecode to an codeinstancecode of codeYcode a valid subclass of the initial type codeXcode... WITHOUT the need for explicit cast ascriptions littering the code, or variable shadowingp  pIf I just had this in the constructorp  precodepublic WrapYY y  this.instance  y  codepre  pEclipse still complains that code.barcode is not a method of type codeXcode because I guess it cannot infer for certain that codeWrapYY ycode will be used prior to construct the codeWrapYcode instancep  precodepublic void bar         instance.bar  ERROR        codepre  pHere is the current approach I have, littered with castsp  precodepublic WrapYY y  Yinstance  y   public void bar   Yinstance.bar  codepre  pI havent come across this particular type of architectural problem in my experience before, file it under DecoratorBasedInheritanceTypeCasting... Please enlighten me as to how I can model this in a better way.p  pAnother issue is that, if in future someone extends codeWrapYcode, the type of instance their class inherits will be the natural uncasted type of codeXcode, when they may reasonably assume it should be of type codeYcode.p  pThanksp
Negative 2678 pI have been reading that ActiveRecord Transactions are automatically wrapped around save and destroy actions.  My question relates to the following scenario.p  pI have an inventory system that tracks Shipments and adjusts a Products inventory amount when a shipment is created.  When I delete a shipment, I have it programmed that the shipment quantities are then added back to the Products inventory amount.  This scenario is designed for if a user fouls up a shipment.  Deleting the shipment will then add the shipped items back into inventory.p  pMy question is when the productshipments are looped through is it necessary to provide the Product.transaction block or can I omit this since the destroy method is automatically wrapped in a transaction  Is it ok to wrap an entire loop in a transaction like I have How can I best ensure that all these database operations are rolled back if something goes haywirep  precodedef destroy   shipment  Shipment.findparams[id]   shipments  shipment.productshipments   Product.transaction do     shipments.each do s       difference  s.qtyshipped.toi       Product.updateinventoryquantitiesdifference, s.productid     end   end   shipment.destroy   respondwith shipment, location gt shipmentsurl end codepre

Negative 2678 pThis question regards website programming. My primary languages are cc and I dont know much about web development, except that say I understand html and css.

I dont have any experience with JavaScript, but for the sake of this project Im willing to learn it if necessary.p  pLets say I have a database, where each entry is about a book. It contains the fields title, authors and publication date. p  pI would like to create a simple website with a search box that has this dynamic result feature, so that you get suggestions after you type in a few letters. All those suggestions, as well as search results, need to be based purely on the database. p  pThis could be a static website or based on any Content Management System, Im familiar with Joomla, but was unable to find an outofthe box component that would do just that. All those search modules search the entire website and I only need to search the database. p
Negative 2678 pInterface Segregation principle aims to avoid creating useless dependencies between components by splitting groups of cohesive features through new smaller interfaces.p  pOne important benefit of adhering to is the removal of unnecessary compilation time forced when components were tight coupled with unnecessary part of fat interfaces.p  pBut I wonder whether that benefit really exists in strongJavastrong...p  pIndeed, in Java, contrary to C world for instance, as long as one used method doesnt change its signature, client component can be left untouched even if dependent moduleinterfaces generally has grown, avoiding the need to recompile this latter.p  pSo, is the benefit of compilation coupling really significant maybe even nonexistent in Javap

From what I understood, it seems to me that the motto of modern C is expressivity with no compromise on performance. Modern C style leads to safe, clean, and fast code with little to no performance penalty and, possibly, with a performance gain over oldstyle C.p  pNow Ive made a little test to assess how big this gain is concerning emloopsem.

Negative 2678 pI am just practising Java OOPs concepts by building a dummy project of Library management system.p  pInitially I had classes for Book, Customer, Administrator with Customer, Administrator extending abstract user class I then created list classes BookCollection, CustomerCollection which hold the list of instances of above classes in ArrayList for a while am not dealing with databases and perform add, delete, sort methods on corresponding ArrayList strongjust one inline question will it be a good design practice if I replace ArrayList related code with database operation once I start dealing with database, with each xyzCollection dealing with xyzTable in databasestrongp  pThe main problem Since I thought earlier that I will have to maintain only list of books, customers across app, I made ArrayLists static. Also, I wrote enough of static methods addXyz, deleteXyz, searchXyz, sortXyz methods However now I realize that for search of Customers or Books I may have or rather should to return list of them matching the name, that means I have to return another ArrayList, which should be an instance of xyzCollection, however I cant use ArrayList in these xyzCollection as it is staic shared among all instances. p  pInitially it was appearing I will need shared ArrayList, but am now doubting my initial decision. What should be correctp  ul liShould I make ArrayList and corresponding methods non static and make any corresponding code changes at callsli liOr should I return ArrayList instead of XyzCollectionli ul  pWhat will be better in terms of code design Or I have made definite mistake in making them all staticp

The type of codeexpcode is double so the type of codecommasvcode must be double.p  pThe thing is that I want to store the list in order to use it, for example, on a function call. For instancep  precodeh  createobject computelisth,1,cos3.14159 codepre  pwill give the expected result of a certain codecomputelistcode function.p  pAs basis bison file Ive used mfcalc example from the a hrefhttpwww.gnu.orgsoftwarebisonmanualbison.htmlMulti002dfunctionCalc relnofollowbison manuala and I replaced the codeyylexcode function by other one generated a hrefhttpsgist.github.com4699166 relnofollowusing flexa. By now I can do things likep  precodepi  3.14159 sinpi lnexp5 codepre  pwith the modified version of codeyylexcode function with flex but I want use the commaseparated values with function calls, lists creation and more.p  pThanks for your answers.p

Negative 2678 pI have a form where the user can upload an image and that image gets displayed on a webpage. I use the Wideimage library to resize the image and to rename the image. In the display code I have the name and type specified, but the problem is I dont know how to convert the image type in Wideimage so that it will display properly. I hope that makes sense.p  pAnother option that would work is if I could somehow get the image type of the file name and then use that in the display code. I was looking at the codephp function getimagesizecode but I couldnt quite get it working, that is, I had to run a bunch of if statements to see what type of image it was. It didnt seem practical.p
Negative 2678 pWe are looking into using kanban for a team of 3 engineers with a range of responsibilities.p  pAs this is a SME, all members of the team have multiple roles. We each manage a number of projects and we each are responsible for a certain helpdesk workload .p  pWhen introducing kanban we immediately saw an imrovement in communication at the task level. Task being defined here as small executable pieces of work that do not require followup or supervision. p  pAt the project level however, our current approach does not improve with kanban or were not doing it right. Projects are assigned a responsable team member, who can then create tasks for the team as a whole  tasks that then would be picked up on the kanban board.p  pWhat we see is that either we p  ul lifocus on the execution of the tasks on the board at the task level and that tasks at the project management level tend to be ignoredli lior that we put on our project management hat and followup on our projects but also that we then just do all the tasks we create for the project ourselvesli ul  pThe first is not that bad, there is a lot of communication and projects get discussed when their tasks come up on the board, but we have no method of prioritizing at the project level.p  pThe second parallelizes the execution of multiple projects but does not enforce communication among the team nor does there happen a distribution of the tasks anymore.p  pDoes anybody have a set of working principles for a joint project managementoperational team in a kanban settingp

Negative 2678 pI have an app that consists of a local server and a GUI client. The server is written in Python, while the GUI is meant to be changable, and is written in Flex 4. The client queries the local server for information and displays it accordingly. Both applications are meant to be run on the same computer, and will only communicate locally. At the moment, the client and the Python server communicates via a basic socket, the client writes a request to the socket, and the socket returns some data.p  pHowever, since Im writing a desktop app, I thought it might be easier to maintain and to polish a system that uses standard streams instead of a socket. The server would listen for coderawinputcode continuously, and output according to anything written to stdin, and the client, in this case, would use AIRs codeNativeProcesscode class to read and write to stdout and stdin, rather than using sockets. p  pThe client and server are separate processes, but are meant to be started at more or less the same time. I dont really have need for complex networking, just local crosslanguage communication. p  pWhat are the pros and cons of each approach What would I gain or lose from using sockets, vs what I would gain or lose from using standard streams to communicate Which one is more efficient Which one is easier to maintainp

Negative 2678 pI am using the get parameters so the user can choose XML output or Json. Upon their choice it either runs a json function or a xml function, on the same page.

It does not run anything else. The problem is when it attempts to writep  precodeheaderExpires Mon, 26 Jul 1997 050000 GMT  headerLastModified  . gmdate D, d M Y His  .

Negative 2678 pI need to create a usercontrol that behaves like a combobox.  Instances of this combobox will be databound to a certain collection at runtime. i.e a collection of strings, to keep this question as minimal as possible. p  pHowever, this combobox needs to have an exclusion list, which holds entries that are not shown in the dropdown list of the combobox, in the case they do appear in the databound collection. They are filtered out.p  pUp till this point I have managed to create a control that fullfills the requirements.p  p1 However, the screens that use these comboboxes are used to display objects that might have been created before certain entries were manually added to the exclusion list I described above. In these cases I still need to have the comboboxes show the value, even though it is in the exception list. However, in case the user tries to change the value, it should not appear in the dropdown.p  p2 Apart from the exclusion list, I also need to filter the remaining elements based on a simple rule. For simplicity, lets assume I dont want entries with a string length of exactly 7.p  pIm very new to WPF. I have tried over and over, and I see no starting point to implement these last two requirements. Im hoping someone here can point me in the right direction for a way to implement 1 and 2.

I am using VS 2012.p  pI have a SQLCE 4.0 DB with 4 small tables in it. I created a DataSet by adding the DB to the DataSources window.p  pI then added a bindingSource and DataGridView to the form bound them together and pointed them at the DataSource and they added a strongly typed DataSet.p  pIf I manually enter the data into the SDF using Server Explorer and then run the app I see all the data in the grid.p  pBUT if I enter data into the grid, one row or many it does not get committed to the DB.p  pIf I do all this in code and dont use any of the autogenerated stuff I can get it to work but the existing app uses all the autogenerated stuff and I dont feel like going back and fixing 20 grids by hand if this is the only pattern I can get to work.p  pI feel like I must be missing something really simple that writes are not getting through to the DB, but I cant find it.p  pThxp

Negative 2678 pIs it possible to use Python to make a server and use another coding language to create a client side program Im using Director 8.510 Made by Adobe, much similar to FlashPlayer and the server on this scripting language is quite bad. Im mainly looking for something that will point me in the right direction on what to search for, havent had much luck w google. The server I apparently used last time found an old .py script I had utilized the BaseHTTPServer module. Is this the one I should be using for basic data transfer of .txt files for a gamep  pIf worst comes to worse than Ill probably use JavaC but Im hoping I will not have to. Director compiles the source code to a .exe called a projector or a shockwave file if that makes any difference. Im tired of using multiusr.xtra for Director, not only is it slow it only allocates 1000 connections. Any help is much appreciatedp

Strangely, if I remove this final baby array final  as in the order of declarationdefinition the 2nd to last baby array starts crapping out. p  pHere is my codep  precode Public MotherArray as Variant, BabyOneArray, BabyTwoArray, BabyThreeArray, BabyFourArray as Double declare may other variables and arrays, too  Sub MainMacro     do stuff     Call SunRaySubRoutinex, y      do stuff      Rangeblah  BabyOneArray Rangeblahblah  BabyTwoArray     Rangeblahbloh  BabyThreeArray Rangeblahblue  BabyFourArray  End Sub  Sub SunRaySubRoutinex,y     n  x  SheetsABC.RangeA1.Value  1      ReDim MotherArray18, n as Variant, BabyOneArrayn, BabyTwoArrayn as Double     ReDim BabyThreeArrayn, BabyFourArrayn as Double      do stuff      For i  0 to n          BabyOneArrayi  MotherArray0,i         BabyTwoArrayi  MotherArray2,i         BabyThreeArrayi  MotherArray4,i         BabyFourArrayi  MotherArray6,i     Next          End Sub codepre  pI have tried to declare all arrays as the Variant type, but to no avail. I have tried to give BabyFourArray a different name, but to no avail. p  pWhats really strange is that even if I comment out the part which makes the BabyFourArray, the array still has zero values for each element. p  pWhats also a bit strange is that the first baby array never craps out although, the 2nd one crapped out once one time out of maybe 30.p  pBANDAID As a temporary fix, I just publicly declared a fifth dummy array which doesnt get filled or ReDimensioned. This fifth array has no actual use besides tricking the system out of having the Compile Error Expected Array.p  pDoes anyone know whats causing this Compile Error Expected Array problem with Excel VBAp  pThanks,p  pEliasp

Negative 2678 pIm part of a professionaloriented undergraduate organization at Michigan State University that wishes to maintain its web presence on our universitys server, in part because the code.educode web address looks professional. However, we wish to allow various members of our organization to edit the website, which complicates the situation because not everyone in our organization has the programming skills for HTMLCSS our university prevents all personal and group webspace from using serverside scripting.p  pOne potential solution that I have discovered uses a hrefhttpwww.weebly.com relnofollowWeeblysa website generating service. There is a feature of Weebly located under codeSettings gt ArchiveUnpublishcode that allows one to download a code.zipcode file of the site after having manipulated the site through Weeblys GUI. Such a solution would allow our members who do not have the knowhow to edit HTMLCSS to simply edit the website through Weebly, download it, and then upload it to our universitys server.p  pThe issue is the following for whatever reason, after doing this, part of the website is not rendering correctly in certain browsers. In particular, in Internet Explorer and Google Chrome  though emnotem in Safari or Firefox the two columns in the main content area of every page are vertically centered. This is most apparent on the our a hrefhttpswww.msu.eduqualmsconstitution.html relnofollowconstitution webpagea, as the relative length of the constitution leads to the Meetings sidebar being located very far down the page. You can compare this to the rendering of the same page on the a hrefhttpqualms.weebly.comconstitution.html relnofollowWeebly sitea, where the issue does not arise and the Meetings sidebar is at the top of the page, emregardless of the browserem.p  pDoes anyone know why this might be the case and whether there is an easy fix As noted at the outset, we wish to maintain the website on our universitys servers for professional reasons, so maintaining the website on Weebly and redirecting the code.educode address to the Weebly site is not an option.p

Negative 2678 pI have noticed that when I port my html code into Django template the width of the html element changes a bit. Here is what is happening see the HTML code belowp  ol liI define jQuery object an give it css attribute width  498px.li liI immediately print out using JS alert command the width attribute and it is still 498px as expected.li liI append the object to the bodyli liI print out objects css width attribute again, and it is changed to 497.7665px.li ol  pSo it looks like the problem occurs during appending the object to body.p  pExactly same code does not have that problem when I am just loading it from file without Django template.p  pWhy is this happening and is there any way around it Thanks.p  pEDIT Finally I was able to isolate the problem. Below is the HTML code. Like I said, if you try to load it into the browser directly, both alerts before placement onto body and after will give you width498px as expected.p  pHowever, if you set it up as Django template and run with Django development server, the second alert after placement onto body will give you a slightly different number depending on the browser Firefox gives 497.76666px, IE gives 498.1px. I have not checked other browsers.p  pIt is important to note, that it is that combination of css attributes left, top, width, height, borderwidth, backgroundcolor, borderstyle that shows the problem. If you remove at least one of them, the problem goes away.p  pIf you happen know what is going on andor what the viable workaround is, I would really appreciate it. Thanks.

Negative 2678 pI am making a web app and need some player pricing algorithm for NBA players, much like what a hrefhttpfanduel.com relnofollowFanduela uses. Does anybody have any resources or know how to implement something like this in Ruby I would like to have players that I can add to a team that must fit within a predefined salary cap. I would be able to build a 5 player team PG, SG, SF, PF, C and a 9 player team PG, PG, SG, SG, SF, SF, PF, PF, C. Players salaries are changed daily. With Fanduel, in order to get the exact players I want, they are oftentimes 10 over the combined limit. It seems like there is some trick to this equation. The problem seems similar to something called a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiKnapsackproblem relnofollowthe knapsack problema.p

beyond the stage and then remove them from the stage and splice from the Array but ... when I increase the speed of spawning when i have 2 rows with 5 ships on the stage or morethat doest work.p  pAnd the second error I think is from that fact .... that I have 2 rows at the same time on the stage.p  precodeArgumentError Error 2025 The supplied DisplayObject must be a child of the caller. at

Negative 2678 pIm trying to use Windows Azure Access Control to avoid the security risks in using usernamespasswords in my app and to simplify the authentication. However, this is a site that can be used by medium or large companies that may wish to preauthenticate users. In other words, they may want to bulk create users by putting in the users Windows Live IDs and create their accounts automatically, before that user has ever signed in through Azure ACS. I could accomplish this by sending that user an email with a link to a onetimeuse page to create their account, but I am hoping to do something a little more seamless.p  pWhat Im trying to do is equivalent to how Team Foundation Service .visualstudio.com lets you add users to a team project just by putting in their Windows Live IDs and once you do, they can log in and access the project, even if that user had never signed in to TFS previously.p  pWhat I dont understand is how to do that using ACS and System.IdentityModel. I can use the nameidentifier claim to uniquely identify a user, but how do I get a nameidentifier for another user through a given providerp  pIm sorry if Im not explaining this well, so feel free to ask questions.p

It appears I am not linking my model class to a LinQ entity but when I add my context class, it throws errors on my inv.FieldName columns in my ListInvoiceModel Class.p  pTLDR Version  How Can I return selected fields from DbContext Class instead of entire table  Why does adding a DBContext class raise errors on my ListModelClass fieldsp
Negative 2678 pIm having an odd problem with accessing files through SDL2 on Mac. I am using XCode 4 on OS X Mountain Lion, and I am using SDL2 as a framework. I am NOT compiling SDL2 from source. I have added the framework to the bundle, as well as the files I need loaded. The program builds and runs fine from XCode, but files do not load outside of the editor I.E. if I doubleclick the standalone .app the files dont load. Here is what my .app package looks likep  precodeMyApp.app     Contents         Frameworks             SDL2.framework         MacOS             MyApp         Resources             Configure.txt             MyBMP.bmp         Info.plist         PkgInfo codepre  pIn my C code, I have attempted thisp  precodeSDLLoadBMPMyApp.appContentsResourcesMyBMP.bmp codepre  pAs well as just thisp  precodeSDLLoadBMPMyBMP.bmp codepre  pAnd virtually everything inbetween.

Within the XCode editor, only the long absolute paths work, while nothing Ive tried has worked in the standalone .app. p  pAre others experiencing this issue I had the files loading when I was using SDL 1.2, but for some reason nothing seems to load with SDL2. Does SDL2 do something weird with the active directory during initializationp  pEDIT 1 My most recent attempt to figure out whats going on used this codep  precodeinclude SDL2SDL.h include stdio.h include stdlib.h  int main int argc, char argv     ifSDLInitSDLINITEVERYTHING lt 0          return EXITFAILURE      FILE test  fopenTest.txt, w      if test          return EXITFAILURE      fprintftest, Lets see where this ends up...     fclosetest     return EXITSUCCESS      The rest of my code, which shouldnt ever come into play...  codepre  pWhen run from the XCode 4 editor, this works as expected. In the Debug folder, right next to my .app file, there is a Test.txt file containing the phrase Lets see where this ends up.... However, when run by clicking the standalone app, the program ends immediately and there is no text file to be found. Ive checked the logs, and it simply says the program exited with code 1. Through more thorough analysis, it seems that codefopencode is failing. Does anyone have an idea as to what may be going onp

Every image on my server can be uniquely identified by a string, and I use this as the id for the image.p  pMy main idea was this Use an LRU Cache to hold the images, but instead of holding the Bitmaps that are very large I want to hold the raw image data binary, so I can use the same image to build bitmaps of different sizes and qualities on demand depending on the specific situation. p  pThis is my implementation so farp  precode    public class ImageHandler       private static class BitmapCache extends LruCacheltString, byte[]gt              public WigoBitmapCacheint maxSize              supermaxSize                   Override         protected int sizeOfString key, byte[] value              return value.length                     private static class ImageHandlerThread extends Thread                    THIS THREAD WILL DECODE THE IMAGE AND SET THE BITMAP TO THE IMAGEVIEW IN THE BACKGROUND                     Activity activity         ImageView imageView         byte[] imageBytes          public ImageHandlerThreadActivity activity, ImageView imageView, byte[] imageBytes                      this.activityactivity             this.imageViewimageView             this.imageBytesimageBytes                   public void run               BitmapFactory.Options o  new BitmapFactory.Options             o.inJustDecodeBounds  true             BitmapFactory.decodeByteArrayimageBytes, 0, imageBytes.length, o             int factor1o.outHeightheight             int factor2o.outWidthwidth                          height and width are for now constant              o  null             o  new BitmapFactory.Options             if factor1gtfactor2                 o.inSampleSizefactor1             else                 o.inSampleSizefactor2             Bitmap bit  BitmapFactory.decodeByteArrayimageBytes, 0, imageBytes.length,o             setBitmapbit             bit  null                     private void setBitmapfinal Bitmap bit              activity.runOnUiThreadnew Runnable                   Override                 public void run                      imageView.setImageBitmapbit                                                         private static class QueueItem      USED TO HOLD INFO ABOUT THE IMAGE REQUEST UNTIL THE IMAGE GETS FROM THE SERVER          String imageName         Activity activity         ImageView imageView          public QueueItemString imageName, Activity activity, ImageView imageView                       this.imageNameimageName             this.activity  activity             this.imageView  imageView                     private BitmapCache cache  this cache holds the image binaries      private ArrayListltQueueItemgt queue  this queue holds the info about the request, until the server sends the image      public ImageHandlerint maxSize              cachenew BitmapCachemaxSize         queue  new ArrayListltQueueItemgt            public synchronized void setBitmapActivity activity, ImageView imageView, String imageName              byte[] imageBytes  cache.getimageName         if imageBytesnull                      QueueItem item  new QueueItemimageName, activity, imageView             queue.additem                   HERE IS THE CODE TO RETRIEVE THE IMAGE BINARY FROM MY SERVER, THIS CODE WORKS FINE, SO THERE IS NO REASON TO BOHER YOU WITH IT                    else                      ImageHandlerThread thread  new ImageHandlerThreadactivity, imageView, imageBytes             thread.start                     public synchronized void insert String imageName, byte[] imageBytes                THIS METHOD IS THE CALLBACK THAT IS CALLED WHEN THE IMAGE BINARY IS RECEIVED FROM THE SERVER           cache.putimageName, imageBytes          for QueueItem item queue                      if item.imageName.equalsimageName                              ImageHandlerThread thread  new ImageHandlerThreaditem.activity, item.imageView, imageBytes                 thread.start                 queue.removeitem                             codepre  pBasically, the main method here is setBitmap, it gets the activity, the imageView that needs the bitmap, and the name of the image name. If the image is already in the cache, a new thread is started to decode the bytes into the proper size bitmap and set the bitmap to the imageView. If the image is not present in the cache, the request is put in a queue until the image is received, the image is retrieved from the server and then the same thread as before is started.p  pAll this works absolutely fine, the problem is that when the imageView is set another bitmap for the image or even when the activity is destroyed, the bitmap is still resident in memory and is not collected by the GC. p  pAt first I though that it is because I was keeping a reference to the activity, and that reference keeps the activity alive, but it seems not to be the case, my reference to an activity is very short lived, and once the image arrives from the server this reference is cleared.p  pI am running out of memory fast with this implementation, and I have no idea why or what to do to fix it. The bitmaps I create are not collected although I keep no references to them. Could this be an artifact of the way I decode the images or do the threads keep references that are not collected properly Anyone has any ideasp

Negative 2678 pIn my iOS app on all previous versions of the OS, we record audio occasionally, then sleep for a while, then record again, and cycle for ever sleep is to maintain battery.  This worked fine up to iOS 7, even when the app was in background.  Now, when the app is in the background the call to AudioQueueStart fails to start recording with an error 16981.  I cant seem to find this error code in the documentation or on the Web, and if I turn it into an NSError, it says The operation couldnt be completed. OSStatus error 16981., which isnt all that helpful.p  pI have a theory that Apple are closing a hole here the idea being why would you want to start recording from a background process, unless you are spying  Well, with the users consent signed and paid for, thats exactly what we are doing.p  pSo can anyone confirm or deny that this is expected, or what I might be able to do about it.  Its a bit of a killer for our app.  I have filed it as a bug with Apple, and will try to report progress here.p  pUPDATE 3rd October 2013p  pAlthough the previous answer seemed to work for this for a while it has stopped working now with 12985, which is because another app has turned on audio.  This is of course why I need to use the mixing flag.p  pUPDATEp  piOS 7.0.3 and later seem to have fixed this issue completely.p
Negative 2678 h1Introductionh1  pIve been attempting to build this project for many weeks now, and trying multiple solutions that I cant get my head around. Let me describe the project a little. Its a textbased server, that players can login to via telnet or a client, essentially like a MUD. They can then create and interact with objects, giving them verbs and properties.p  pThe server is basically just a database of objects, each object has an ID, a name, a location which is another object, a list of its contents objects and some other flags. Objects can have verbs and properties. Properties are just stored data string, int, float, we. Verbs are methodsfunctions. Objects are interacted with using commands such as put something in container. An old version of the server already exists, its called LambdaMOO. Im attempting to recreate it since it hasnt been updated in a very, very long time.p  pYou can read more indepth about how objects, verbs and properties should work at a hrefhttpbit.ly17XIqjY relnofollowhttpbit.ly17XIqjYap  h1An Exampleh1  pLet me describe what Id like. Imagine we have an object. Object 256, its called Button. It has the property count along with all the default properties that are inherited from its parent i.e. description. It has one verb on it, called push. This verb contains this codep  precodethis.count  1 this.description  This button has been pushed   this.count   times. player.tellYou press the button and feel a chill run down your spine. codepre  pWhen the player types push button on the server, the push verb will run and outputp  precodeYou press the button and feel a chill run down your spine. codepre  pIf you then codelookcode at the button, youll see its updated description.p  pNote that codeplayercode in the above script refers the object of the player executing the verb. codetellcode is another verb, on the player object. However the codetellcode verb has a flag saying it is executable from other verbs.p  h1What languageh1  pMy main question is what languages can I use for the verbs Ive tried using node.js and the vm library. Ive tried using C to parse C. Ive tried using C to parse JavaScript. The issue I keep getting is that I have no way of controlling the permissions of the verbs and properties. If I translate them to literal functions in JavaScript, I cant determine which object they are running on and what permissions it should have. If a user calls a function on another users object, I have no way of intercepting that call and stopping it if the permissions arent correct. Im not entirely fussed as to which language is used for the verb code it just needs to be sandboxed. Properties need to be only readablewriteable when they are set to be so by the user, same with verbs. I imagine I could use a language with overloading like PHPs  get, set, call.p  pI need to also be able to inject these variables into the verb mostly determined from the command typed, unless the verb is being called from another verbp  precodeplayer object          the player who typed the command this object            the object on which this verb was found caller object          this will be the same as player, unless another                            verb calls the command in which case it is the object                            containing that verb. verb string            the first word of the command argstr string          everything after the first word of the command args list of strings   a list of the words in argstr dobjstr string         the direct object string found during parsing dobj object            the direct object value found during matching prepstr string         the prepositional phrase found during parsing iobjstr string         the indirect object string iobj object            the indirect object value codepre  pI also need to be able to access any object from any other object so long as the permissions work out.p  precode Object 128. Verb multiply   Prep this none this   Perms r x return args[0]  args[1]   Object 256. Verb square     Prep this none this   Perms r x return 128multiplyargs[0], args[0]   Object 512.

Negative 2678 pI had a strange issue with Sharepoint 2010 where users with contribute permissions when they try to open a document it always open in read only mode. I reviewed the farm configuration and everything seems to be fine. I also noticed that users with office 2013 are able to open and edit the documents with no issues. I knew at that point that it was related to the client office version and not Sharepoint. After a lot of research I found the solution. p  ul liOn the client computer experiencing the issue click on RUN then type RegEdit. li ligo to this path HKEYCURRENTUSERSOFTWAREMicrosoftOffice14.0CommonInternetli liRight click and create new DWORD entry and give it a name of FSSHTTPOffli liDouble click the new entry and enter 1 for the value. li ul  pOnce done you might need to reboot the computer but not always required. once done the user with office 2010 will be able to edit documents in Sharepoint.p  pPlease note that to apply this change to all users, your IT Admin will have to push out this change as a policy change on the network.p  pHope this solution will help someone out there p  pEyadp

Negative 2678 pIm trying to use a script task to check if a file is in a folder.  If the file is there then the package will continue through its steps, if not it should quit.  I have a variable UseruvIfExistsFileName which is used by a C script to check and see if the file exists in a certain location.  Right now, I have to use the full file name, i.e. data.csv and the precedence constraint will only return true if the file name matches.  What I would like to do is change the value of the IfExistsFileName variable which is a string from data.csv to .csv.  But when I chance the first part of the variable to a wild card it returns unmatched.  Which Im sure its supposed to, I just dont know how to get it to return true when any .csv file is present.  My for each loop which comes after in the process uses wildcards just fine but my script is not having any of it.  p  pThanks for your help in advance.   p

Negative 2678 pThe scenario is that we have a list of items displayed in a list ListView on Android and UITableView on iOS. The ItemSource comes from a web service. In addition to the data properties of the item, each of the items has the additional state that it can be added to a collection of currently selected items which is reflected in another collection on the view model.p  pI need to be able to alter the display of the item in the list based on whether it is in the currently selected list.p  pThe datacontext given for binding is the data that comes from the ItemsSource, which is jsut the raw data for an item and has no way of knowing if that data is one of the currently selected items. That has to be done by asking the ViewModel.p  pIm struggling to find the best solution to this problem. I certainly do not want to modify the ItemsSource to add a bogus property to each item in the source.p  pI can hack something around it by overriding the AdapterTableViewSource to hardcode this without actually using binding for this, but that seems wrong.p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pThat was not explained very well, so let me try to explain using an existing MvvmCross example as the basis.p  pConsider the books sample from N6 and N7. We want to add a new feature where we can mark the books that we already own and for those that we have marked it shows an indicator to tell you that you own the book.p  pImagine that the view model has methods likep  precodepublic bool IsOwnedstring id public void SetOwnedstring id, bool owned codepre  pThe implementation of those is not important for this discussion, but I would probably also need some form of Event Handler to notify when ownership has changed for a book.p  pI am trying to figure out how I can set up a binding on the ListViewItemTableViewCell so that it can query the IsOwned method on the ViewModel using the ID from the DataContext for the item to control visibility of a UI element in that record.p  pIm guessing that I will have to create a custom source binding, but that binding has to reference the ViewModel and the DataContext so I am a little lost here.p  pNote that in my real problem I am trying to solve, the status of whether something is marked is temporary and local only to the ViewModel if I exit the screen it is not remembered. This precludes the idea of having a Service for getting the information.p

Negative 2678 pI have an iOS app that shows the user a set of different news feeds in a PageViewController. Everytime the app starts, it requests the news data from the backend for every single feed. In case it worked fine, a notification via for every single news feed is sent via NSNotificationCenter so the data can be displayed.  In case of an error, a notification for every single feed is sent as well, triggering a popup message that tells the user something went wrong. But if this happens, a popup will be shown for every news feed, up to the amount of added news feeds. p  pMy question is, how can I combine all those error case notifications to a single one and therefore avoid having many useless and annyoing popups p

Negative 2678 pAfter 2 months of applied maths research, I have found a way to have substantial gains to manage data in my application domain to be published.... In short, my application domain requires an associative container, contiguous in memory to avoid cache misses in large scale supercomputing applications. Fast insertions and deletions are not the priority  the priority is to have the fastest possible binary search on codekeyscode via codestdupperboundcode. I have an early working implementation, but now I am thinking about implementing an codeSTLlikecode container with a good design.p  pSo, my associative container has the following propertiesp  ul liit usually contains between code10code and code100code millions of codekeyscode and codevaluescodeli licodekeyscode are unsigned integers of code8code, code16code, code32code, code64code or code128code bitsli licodevaluescode are usually tuples of code10code different typesli lieach codekeycode is associated to a single codevaluecodeli lithe most critical operation is binary search on codekeyscode probably via a call to codestdupperboundcodeli liinsertionsdeletionssorting are not criticalli ul  pSo my question is what would be the best internal implementation of course I will eventually run some benchmarks, but discarding some possibilities would be greatp  ol licodestdvectorltstdpairltKey, Typegtgtcode with iterators to codestdpairltKey, Typegtcodeli licodestdpairltstdvectorltKeygt, stdvectorltTypegtgtcode with iterators to codestdpairltKeyamp, Typeampgtcodeli liOther solutions li ol  pWhat would be the best solution  Any remarks or ideas will be greatly appreciated...p

Negative 2678 pI saw tons of answers to this question on the web but, can you believe me I still dont get the solution of this problem. I have an array of values. The size of this array is n. I have also the defined value sum. What I want is to generate n random values in such a way that their sum is equals to sum, preferably uniformly distributed, otherwise for example having the first random number equals to sum and the rest equals to zero is not that nice. I need two algorithms which accomplish this task. One with positive Integers and one with positive Floats. Thanks a lot in advancep

Negative 2678 pI am debugging a VS 2008 C project. The project links to a static lib whose PDB file is present in same folder as the .lib file. It used to be all OK. PDB of lib file is loaded and source file is accessible during debugging. But now it suddenly fail to load with no change at all.p  pSo how do I diagnose in VC to make sure the pdb is found and loaded by IDEp  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pI changed EXE project setting to be YES for Use library dependency inputs, and now I can access source code of the lib now, though it doesnt answer my initial question of why pdb of lib suddenly fails to load.p  pstrongFurther Questionstrongp  pMy understanding is EXE file statically links to LIB file, so all referenced binary code in LIB are already included in EXE binary. So do I actually need LIB file present And, do I need LIB pdb file present or are the debugging info integrated into EXEs pdb file as wellp

Negative 2678 pIm trying to reproduce the common issue with jquery click not working on ipad. And it works for me all the time. Heres the jsfiddle a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netEbE2M11 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netEbE2M11a As so ask to provide some code, here it is from the fiddle abovep  precode.test.onclick, functione    some stuff to test here  codepre  pAm I missing anything or does it work for some ipads only and doesnt work for other What version of safari and ipad I need to reproduce the issuep  pUPDATE To find examples of click not working on iPad, just google for iPad click event not working. Here are a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7892863jqueryclicknotworkingwithipadtwoa a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions17161514onclickeventisnotworkingonipadandtabletexamplesa from so. Why I ask this if things are working for me Because things may not work for my clients and works on my machine is not reliable. I would like to get something like versions of iPad or safari on which click doesnt work properly. With jsfiddle example preferably. So that I could get this iPad from friendshop and check it. If its the one can reproduce this kind of issues I just buy it and use it for testing during development.p
Negative 2678 pWeve just deployed a WCF app to a load balanced environment. We noticed that for the help page enabled by codeltwebHttp helpEnabledtrue gtcode in the  web.config whichever url is used to access the help page first is the one that will be used to describe the relative urls across all environments. So if we hit the codehelpoperationsGetWidgetListcode page through the externally facing url all the relative urls and the Widget List pages header will reference the externally facing url. If we visit the codehelpoperationsGetGadgetcode page through localhost from one of the servers behind the load balancer, the Gadget page will display all localhost urls regardless of how that help page is accessed.p  pFirst Time img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comnzmrW.png altlocalhost firstp  pAll subsequent calls img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comfvuV9.png altmeans localhost everywherep  pRestarting the app in IIS seems to reset the state of this problem, but it will crop up again if pages are accessed first at the wrong url. Is there a way to define a canonical base url that the help page should always use Weve explored setting codebaseAddresscode in the codeweb.configcode but if I understand correctly, since were hosting in IIS those attributes are ignored.p

Negative 2678 pLets have a large codeControlcode whose codeSizecode is given externally and cannot be altered. This codeControlcode is contained in codePanelcode. There is very useful feature codePanel.Autoscroll  truecode, which enables comfortable scrolling of the large codeControlcode with zero work.p  pThere is one problem The codeControlcode needs to handle the codeMouseWheelcode and it gets the events as expected  it is focused on mouse enter. Ufortunately the codePanelcode strongalsostrong captures the same mouse wheel events and uses them for scrolling. This is not desirable for the cases the codeControlcode consumes the events.p  pI cannot find a standard way to handle this.

Negative 2678 pWe have written a ClientServer application that uses Azure on the server side. On the client, a user can initiate a very numerically and dataintensive job that is processed on the server. On the clientside, the user then needs to interact with the generated serverside data, which can be anywhere from several KB to several GB. This interaction needs to be as close to realtime as possible, but our current implementation is giving unacceptable delays.p  pA typical server call only requires KBs of data at a time, but many such calls are needed  often in rapid succession.p  pCan anyone recommend an architecturalimplementation approach that could solve this issue  and also be scalable   p  pstrongIve added more details below to better describe what we are doing.strongp  pOn the client side, the user chooses to run numericallyintensive simulations which are run on the server side.  Each simulation generates a database of varying size from several kB to several GB that is stored in blob storage.  When the simulation completes, the user will typically make a number of requests to process the simulation data in different ways.  All of the data processing is done using an external program that runs on the server and the data is passed back to the client for graphical display.  The amount of processed data being passed back is relatively small typically several kb, but it is typical for the user to make a dozen or more requests in less than a minute to see the data processed in different ways for example to see more detailed results in a particular area within the simulation.p  pOur project is architected so that each simulation and each request for processed data are handled by jobs that are put in a queue and then run in a VM as they are pulled from the queue.  This is acceptable for the simulations, but it is too slow taking up to 30s or more when the user wants to interactively examine the simulation data. Because of our architecture, each time the user makes a request to see some processed data, we 1 download the database from blob storage and 2 save it as a file, 3 load it in the external program, 4 instruct the external program of the processing to be done and then 5 pass that processed data back to the client where it is plotted.   We then unload the database from the external program.  Ideally, we would leave the database loaded in our external program so that requests for processed data could be done much faster by eliminating steps 1, 2 and 3.  However, this does not fit well with our architecture since we have multiple VMs each running an instance of the external program and we cant guarantee that the VM used to process the data request will be the one where the data is loaded.p  pAny recommendations on how to improve thisp  pThanks, David.p

Negative 2678 pI implemented a chat client using GTalk servers and aSmack library. So far so good. Now, what I cant wrap my head around is how to notify the user of received chats when the app is closed, the same way all other chat apps do. I was reading into push notifications but all examples I find have a server component as well, which I obviously dont since my app is just a client for GTalk.p  pShould I be using GCM and implement the server side for this Should I instead attempt to start a service that will listen for incoming messages at boot time similar to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2784441tryingtostartaserviceonbootonandroidthis exampleap
Negative 2678 pCurrently we have a requirement to handle exceptions in a spring integration flow.p  pThe current solution was to handle exceptions thrown from any POJO transformer, aggregator, service etc by means of Aspects. And in the aspects a tweet would be sent that an exception occured. However this aspects do not cover exceptions thrown by for example the Spring Integration Flow. That is if an exception happens in an codeltobjecttojsontransformergtcode or a 500 status is returned by an codeltinthttpoutboundgatewaygtcode.p  pWe need a method to handle this. Currently we see that we can have the start of the flow gateway have an error channel attached and in this error channel send a tweet. However the issue is that we also have business logic in the service called by the error channel. So we would need to mix the tweeting notification and business concerns. Also this would mean that each error channel service would manually needed to be programmed to send out a tweet. So if a new error channel service is created by a new developer heshe may forget to put in the tweet code.p  pIs there any way that we could put a common global error handle which also gets called in addition to the flow specific error service. Then in the common global error handler code all the notification tweeting logic and any other cross cutting concerns is run. What would be the best strategy for this then.p  pstrongUPDATE 1strongp  pI have come up with the following code, however it seems to give a StackOverFlowException, however when I change the payload

Negative 2678 pSo ive been trying to make this programme that will store some data for each user some simple strings. It has a login, registration and the main screen. Im using sqlite DB, and i made one table for login and it all works fine. But what i cant figure out how to do is, how to create another subtable for each user when the user registers  What i want to make is, the main frame to list the each users own data which is going to be that subtable. p  pPS. On succesfull login, the login frame instatly populates the JTable in the main frame, where its going to be possible for users to insert, delete or change data.

Negative 2678 pI have couple of questions regarding the docusign api and its Integrator Key Certificationp  ol liIm using REST API calls for Docusign Integration with Salesforce We need Endpoint, UserId, AccountId, Password, Integrator key for Docusign REST API calls. Every value of these fields for different users are stored in Docusign managed objects of salesforce except Integrator Key.  Need of one Integrator Key is making me to either go for harcoding these credentialsuse custom settings of Salesforce. Anyone suggest a better way for other than thisli liSo what I did For Authentication header is, Though it may seem like not a best practice I have no other way to do I have accessed the user credentials from custom settings of Salesforce. But inorder to overcome the limit of 1000 API calls per  hour per account, I am thinking to use multiple user credentials which are changing one after the other for every api call.  So, Will docusign allow the  multiple Integrator Keys Certification that are used in one single apex classli ol  pFor those who are thinking about baseURL parameter in authentication header, I will go with the logininformation api call, or change the value from custom settings depending on environment where the api is called.p  pUsing, all this logic my task is working perfectly but all of sudden I am thinking will Docusign allow to pass certification for the above Integration steps Thanks in advance.   p

Negative 2678 pMy question is whether monads in haskell actually maintain hakells purity, and if so how. Frequently I have read about how side effects are impure but that side effects are needed for useful programs e.g. io. In the next sentence it is stated that haskells solution to this is monads. Then monads are explained to some degree or another, but not really how they solve the sideeffect problem.p  pI have seen a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4063778inwhatsenseistheiomonadpurethisa and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3117583ishaskelltrulypureisanylanguagethatdealswithinputandoutputoutsidethisa, and my interpretation of the answers is actually one that came to me in my own readings  the actions of the IO monad are not the io themselves but objects that, when executed, perform io. But it occurs to me that one could make the same argument for any code or perhaps any compiled executable. Couldnt you say that a C program only produces side effects when the compiled code is executed That all of C is inside the IO monad and so C is pure I doubt this is true, but I honestly dont know in what way it is not. In fact, didnt Moggi sp initially use monads to model the denotational semantics of imperative programsp  pSome background I am a fan of haskell and functional programming and I hope to learn more about both as my studies continue. I understand the benefits of referential transparency, for example. The motivation for this question is that I am a grad student and I will be giving 2 1hour presentations to a programming languages class, one covering haskell in particular and the other covering functional programming in general. I suspect that the majority of the class is not familiar with functional programming, maybe having seen a bit of scheme. I hope to be able to reasonably clearly explain how monads solve the purity problem without going into category theory and the theoretical underpinnings of monads, which I wouldnt have time to cover and anyway I dont fully understand myself  certainly not well enough to present.p  pI wonder if purity in this context is not really welldefined p

Negative 2678 pI have written some code that uses the 32Feet.Net library to connect to Bluetooth devices. The code is written in C and is running on Windows 7.p  pThe code needs to connect to any device in range with the word SMART in its Bluetooth name, query the device for a model number, and disconnect from the device if the model number doesnt match what the code expects. If the model number does match then the code should sit there and log data from the device.p  pThe problem that I am having is that unless I use Windows device manager to delete some of the SMART devices Ive connected to they dont always show up in Bluetooth scans like they should.p  pIm also seeing that sometimes SMART devices with the wrong model numbers are still connected, even though the code tried to close the connection.p  pI was wondering if anyone else had seen this issue, is it a Windows thing, or am I not implementing the library properly.

Maybe its something thats not yet initializedp  pEven more details When using the codeUIToolbarcode as an codeinputAccessoryViewcode, when I tap the codeUITextFieldcode, it doesnt come up above the keyboard, but when I start typing, it does. I am running out of options here...p  pEven more tries to find the problem It seems that running any other animation works, like changing the height of the toolbar.p
Negative 2678 pIm looking for some advice on how to connect to a MySQL database in my Ember application. Ive created a dashboard with some charts using ZingCharts a hrefhttpswww.npmjs.compackageemberzingchart relnofollowemberzingchart addona, and my chart configuration JSON packets are kept in the associated controller for each template. I would need to query the db for different sets of data stored in the same table for each tab of my dashboard.

For example, when I want to create a new variable in the codeactioncode scope like thisp  precodeltsset varnewVar valueThis is a new string gt codepre  pand then I want to get the value of this new variable I can use eitherp  precodeltsproperty valuenewVargt codepre  pand alsop  precodeltsproperty valuenewVargt codepre  pwhich confuses me because I cant figure where is this new variable stored in. The first codepropertycode tag makes me think its stored in the emaction context mapem but outside of the codeValueStackcode, and the second codepropertycode tag makes me think its stored as a new property in the action object, which is placed at the top of the codeValueStackcode whose name doesnt need to be specified when accessing one of its properties... I even got to think that maybe the name of the variable given in the tags attribute codevarcode allows you to access the variable directly... But then I tried to set another variable, this time in the session scope, like thisp  precodeltsset varsessionVar scopesession valueAnother stringgt codepre  pbut the only way I can access its value is byp  precodeltsproperty valuesession.sessionVargt codepre  pbut not byp  precodeltsproperty valuesessionVargt codepre  pso I discarded the thought that the name of the variable could allow you to access the variable straight away.p  pAnother doubt of the kind is when I use the Struts 2s codeactioncode tag. For example, I have an action class that contains a property called codeusersListcode which is a Java codeListcode. Then I want to call that action within my JSP page withp  precodeltsaction namenameAction namespace varactionVar gt codepre  pwhich is supposed to place that action object at the top of the codeValueStackcode. However, when I want to iterate over the codeuserListcode property in the action object, I need to specify also the name of the variable representing the action preceded by codecode like thisp  precodeltsiterator valueactionVar.userListgt     ... ltsiteratorgt codepre  pSo, I dont know exactly where is exactly the action object placed or what is my mistakep  pThanx for your suggestions.p

Negative 2678 pLets say you have a codeUITableViewcode that displays a list of codefilecode metadata, and you want to show the codedownloadprogresscode of each file in a codeUILabelcode of a custom codeUITableViewCellcode. This is an arbitrarily long list  thus dynamic cells will be reused.p  pIf you want to update the label without calling either codereloadDatacode or codereloadRowsAtIndexPathscode, how can you do itp  pFor those who are wondering  I dont want to call either of the codereload...code methods because theres no need to reload the entire cell for each percentage point update on codedownloadprogresscode.p  pThe only solutions Ive come across arep  ul lipAdding the cell as a keyvalue observer for the codefilecodes codedownloadprogresscode.pli lipCalling codecellForRowAtIndexPath...code directly to obtain the label and change its text.pli ul  pHowever, KVO in general isnt a fun api to work with  and even less so when you add cell reuse into the mix. Calling codecellForRowAtIndexPathcode directly each time a percentage point is added feels dirty though.p  pSo, what are some possible solutions Any help would be appreciated.p  pThanks.p

Negative 2678 pGood evening Im working on a task for my programming class where I must write a program using Devc that reads and displays information about items from a .txt file and then gives an option to search and get information about a specific file searching by name.

Negative 2678 pI know there are many links regarding Onbeforeunload,BeforeUnload and Onunload events of JavaScript which have some cross browser problems.

Id like to see one able to setup SQL Server to maintain the integrity of transactions, if your chosen architecture is to have transactions strictly managed at origin, i.e. he alone who starts the transaction, must finish it. This, aside from usual failsafes, e.g. if your code is never reached due to system failure etc.p

Furthermore, I never had to register or identify a SPN when hosting the service in IIS, it just works.  It wasnt until I started searching for this issue that individuals talked about a SPN. Ive never had to worry about SPNs before and Ive used several IIS hosted Kerberos enabled web services in the past.p  pWhats the secret sauce  What am I missing  Id really appreciate it if someone could point me in the right direction.  Is there any other logs I can examineenable to hopefully identity why the HTTP stack has decided to pitch the Kerberos request on the floor  There must be some way of determining why this is failing.p  pstrongUpdate 1strongp  pIm pretty sure that this problem has nothing to do with Server Principal Name as I can see that the domain controller does grant a Kerberos ticket.  On the domain controller I do not see KRB5KDCERRSPRINCIPALUNKNOWN but rather TGSREP granting the Kerberos ticket.  Furthermore, I see the Kerberos ticket in the HTTP request at the server.  Thus, the problem must be with the WCF selfhosted service.p  pstrongUpdate 2strongp  pUsing a Kerberos enabled iOS7 app, I see a slightly different network trace.  I see the domain controller grant the Kerberos ticket to the iOS7 app and then I see the Kerberos ticket presented to the WCF Service at the HTTP level.  However, the response from the WCF service at the HTTP level is HTTP 400, Bad Request.  From what I read, HTTP 400 usually has to do with an issue on the client side.  That is, it is presenting a HTTP packet in a format that is not supported by the HTTP server end.  With all that being said, like the IE example above, everything works fine when the WCF service is hosted in IIS.  There is ZERO information in the WCF logging it never makes it to that level as it is rejected by the HTTP stack and there is ZERO information associated with this event in the event log.p  pIs there something Im missing in the above configuration of the WCF service  What you see above is all that there is.  That is, I am not using the application configuration file to configure this WCF service.  The WCF service is being configured programmatically.  If I remove the authentication configuration, then everything works fine.  The iOS7 app, Safari, and IE can all successfully interact with my selfhosted WCF service.p  pThanks for the helpp

Negative 2678 pIm trying to write a PHP function that takes some text to be displayed on a web page, and then based on some entered search terms, highlights the corresponding parts of the text. Unfortunately, Im having a couple of issues.br To better explain the two issues Im having, lets imagine that the following innocuous string is being searched on and will be displayed on the web pagep  precodeMy daughter was born on January 11, 2011. codepre  pMy first problem is that if more than one search term is entered, any placeholder text I use to mark the start and end of any matches for the first term may then be matched by the second term.br For example, Im currently using the following delimiting strings to mark the beginning and end of a match upon which I use the codepregreplacecode function at the end of the function to turn the delimiters into HTML codespancode tagsp  precodehighlightStart highlightEnd codepre  pThe problem is, if I do a search like code2011 lightcode, then code2011code will be matched first, giving mep  precodeMy daughter was born on January 11, highlightStart2011highlightEnd. codepre  pUpon which when codelightcode is searched for, it will match the word codelightcode within both codehighlightStartcode and codehighlightEndcode, which I dont want.p  pOne thought I had was to create some really obscure delimiting strings in perhaps a foreign language that would likely never be searched on, but I cant guarantee that any particular string will never be searched on and it just seems like a really kludgy solution. Basically, I imagine that there is a better way to do it.br Any advice on this first point would be greatly appreciated.p  pMy second question has to do with how to handle overlapping matches.br For example, with the same string codeMy daughter was born on January 11, 2011.code, if the entered search is codeJan anuarcode, then codeJancode will be matched first, giving mep  precodeMy daughter was born on highlightStartJanhighlightEnduary 11, 2011. codepre  pAnd because the delimiting text is now a part of the string, the second search term, codeanuarcode will never be matched.p  pRegarding this issue, I am quite perplexed and really have no clue how to solve it.br I feel like I need to somehow do all of the search operations on the original string separately and then somehow combine them at the end, but again, Im lost on how to do this.br Perhaps theres a way better solution altogether, but I dont know what that would be.p  pAny advice or direction on how to solve either or both of these problems would be greatly appreciated.br Thank you.p

Negative 2678 pIm trying to design a class to design a 3D mesh in C. My idea is the following 3 base classes Point, Polygon, Polyhedron the mesh has to handle very general shapes The class Polygon contains a vector of shared pointers to Point the vertexes, in the same way Polyhedron contain 2 vector of shared pointers to Point and Polygon. It would be very useful to have inside Polygon a vector of shared pointers to Polyhedron and inside Point 2 vector of shared pointer of Polyhedron. In this way every Point would know the polygons and polyhedrons connected to it.p  pI have already implemented the classes using enablesharedfromthis in this way and all works quite well, but now I have some doubts about this.  Is this design a good design or it may lead to some problems Is a bad behaviour to have 2 objects connected by shared pointers How is the memory management in this casep  pThe shared pointers are very important in the connection PolygonPoint, PolyhedronPoint and PolyhedronPolygon, but not so necessary in the other direction. I thought that I may use weak pointer instead of shared ones, in this way Point would not be responsible of Polygon and Polyhedron life. I prefer not to use standard pointers.p  pI would like to know you opinion, thank you very muchp

board.  li liI have defined a function called getCloseness which measures the emclosenessem of two different states. It is basically the square of the distance between the centroids of the two states. A centroid of a state is the sum of all row values of each piece divided by 4 and the same for columns.li liAfter calculating each state, I am checking if the closeness of this new state is lesser than or equal to the current closeness.li liIf it is not closer, then I will simply discard the new discovered state.li liIf it is closer, then I will update the closeness value and insert this new state into the Queue for future processing.li liThis process terminates when either the queue becomes empty or a state is discovered which is same as the target state.li ol  pThe above approach takes approximately 13 seconds for cases where a minimum of 7 moves are required. I would be grateful if you can tell me how I can further optimize this solution.br The expected time according to the problem is 0.896s.p
Negative 2678 pIm new at GTK. Im using Glade to make an interface and just want to insert objects like buttons and others into a container.  Ive choosen codeGtkFixedcode so that all elements can be freely located and sized. The problem is that when i drag a button for example, the button apparently gets it size from the parent in this case the container and takes a square shape. Heres an image a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comZ7NGk.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comZ7NGk.png altScreen captureap  pI want the button to take the standard size, just like a rectangule or something.

Negative 2678 pI am building out a website that displays filter options along the side of my result set think like how Best Buy allows you to filter down your results by category, brand, price, etc..  I have a number of different categories for the filters such as language, date, people involved, places involved, etc.  I am rendering out what each option is using a repeater control.  This all works beautifully.  p  pHowever, a couple of my filters have very large numbers of options 2030 options, sometimes more.  When I have a large set like this, I want to only render out the first x number of options and hide the rest in a collapsible div that you can click on to display the rest of the options.  For the life of me, I cannot figure out how to do this in a repeater.  I tried handling it in the ItemCreated event but unfortunately that even seems to fire prior to the rendering of the control i had some code that tried inserting an anchor tab if the item being created had an index  x.  It created the anchor tag but rather than outputting it in the middle of the rendered results, it rendered the anchor tag first.  I would think I would want to do something like thisp  precodeprotected void RepeaterItemCreatedobject sender, RepeaterItemEventArgs e      ife.Item.ItemIndex gt 5 or whatever number I want to use as the cut off point               add to some collapsible div element in my content template          else              render the item normally       codepre  pI cant figure out how to tell the item where it would need to be created or if this would even work with a repeater.  Im open to other suggestions besides the repeater as well.  p

Negative 2678 pI had an idea for an asynchronous parallel program for a data science application. Considering a sharedmemory system with one master and 20 slaves. It would have a matrix at the master node the slaves would read the value of the matrix, do some operations using random numbers and the return value would modify some elements of the matrix asynchronously, allowing for overwrites i.e. the slave who came 2nd could overwrite some of the work done by the slave who came 1st. p  pI know this can be done in codepthreadscode but I didnt want to spend energy coding it up before having some prototype. p  pI wrote a parallel program simulator in MATLAB whichp  ul liOneatatime and sequentially, does the operation which the slave would do and records the time.

Negative 2678 pIts common in a REST design to allow partial resources to be returned. In this case I want to allow the user specify only certain fields of a resource to be returned in the JSON representation of that resource.p  pFor example lets say we have a resource Personp  precode    id 12,    name           firstAngie,           last Smith,           middle joy,           maiden crowly,     ,     address            street 1122 Something St.,           ..and so on...     , ... and so on  codepre  pLets say that list of params is pretty long.  And lets say I have an API consumer who at the beginning of creating the API design wants only a couple fields like id and name.first back.  Im assuming its common to allow something like thisp  ppersonfieldsid,namep  pwhere fields says I only want those fields back.p  pThe question I have is, should then the Person resource return all fields with nulls and just those fields with values OR should it just return the Person representation with only fields id and name and you literally remove all the other params dynamically from the backend.p  pSeems like 2 is cleaner, but does it make sense to do that in REST, or do people normally return all other fields to make sure were keeping the representation in terms of structureschema consistentreliable with nullsp
Negative 2678 pI want to sort some numberstring combination but the sorting will be based on the number from that combination. Can you suggest an optimal solutionp  pSay my strings are br12 Masdf br4 Oasd br44 Twer brand so on. The sorting will be based on the numbers like 12, 4, 44 and after the sorting I have to show the full alphanumeric strings.p  pAs the program will run on thousands of data I dont want to split the string and compare the number on each iteration. My plan is to extract the numbers and take those in an array and then sort the array. After sorting done, I want to put back the numbers with associated strings and keep those in a string array to show. It should be done in C. Algorithms should be applied  Insertion sort, Quick sort, Merge sort, etc.p

Negative 2678 pIt seems some update changed GC behavior when built in Debug configuration or with debugger attachedp  precodeCode snippet 1 var a  new object var w  new WeakReferencea a  null  GC.Collect GC.WaitForPendingFinalizers GC.Collect Console.WriteLinew.IsAlive  Alive  Dead codepre  pSuch code used to print codeDeadcode, and it was very handy for writing unittests checking that certain parts that should be GCed are not being held.p  pAfter some .NET 4.x update, this code passes successfully on .NET 2.x and 3.x, but fails on all variants of 4.x. I tried to call it as codeGC.Collect2, GCCollectionMode.Forced, blocking truecode, making codeltgcConcurrent enabledfalsegtcode in codeApp.configcode and codeGCSettings.LatencyMode  GCLatencyMode.Batchcode  nothing helps. If I run the code without debugger attached and it is built in Release configuration i.e. with optimizations  it outputs codeDeadcode. Otherwise it is codeAlivecode.p  pI understand that relying on GC is not a good idea in production. But for tests I dont know how to replace ability to check through test that particular code piece does not leak memory. It is pure test assembly, Im fine with turning some compatibility switches, or something alike. My goal is to check my own code, not the GC optimizations.p  pIs there a way to force GC to previous behavior somehowp  pP.S. I saw almost identical a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions16771249howtoforcefullgarbagecollectioninnet4xquestiona, but at that time it was related to NCrunch. I dont have it installed. I ran the code even from command line, without VS at all, with the same results.p  hr  pstrongUPDstrong I found that if I move code with allocating and setting reference to null into separate method  it consistently outputs codeDeadcode, though.p  precodeCode snippet 2 internal class Program      private static void Mainstring[] args              var w  DoWorkAndGetWeakRef          GC.Collect         GC.WaitForPendingFinalizers         GC.Collect         Console.WriteLinew.IsAlive  Alive  Dead         Console.ReadLine           private static WeakReference DoWorkAndGetWeakRef              var a  new object         var w  new WeakReferencea         a  null         return w       codepre  pSame result if I move out to separate method GC collection calls and WeakReference checkp  precodeCode snippet 3 internal class Program      private static void Mainstring[] args              var a  new object         var w  new WeakReferencea         a  null          CollectAndCheckWeakRefw         Console.ReadLine           private static void CollectAndCheckWeakRefWeakReference w1              GC.Collect         GC.WaitForPendingFinalizers         GC.Collect         Console.WriteLinew1.IsAlive  Alive  Dead       codepre  pThe important point though as it seems is that original codewcode variable is not in current scope. If I move codeConsole.WriteLinew1.IsAlive  Alive  Deadcode back to codeMaincode  it becomes codeAlivecode again.p  pBoth variants are not very convenient sometimes, but at least consistent codeDebugcode or codeReleasecode configuration, debugger is attached or not  still outputs codeDeadcode.p  pNow Im curious how mere presence of WeakReference variable in current execution scope prevents GC from cleaning its Target and why having it somewhere in scope buried in call stack doesnt do the same.p

Negative 2678 pI am creating a user control which contains 2 ListView controls. I want the user to be able to use Designer to set the Columns property for the user control and the 2 ListView controlsbasically, the Columns property for the user control and the 2 ListView controls are to be synced to each other, using the exact same ColumnHeader collections.p  pFor the user control itself, in order for the Columns property to work properly as a collection of column headers, I find I must inherit from System.Collections.ObjectModel.Collection. I set the collection class to Serializable and the class property to DesignerSerializationVisibilityDesignerSerializationVisibility.Content. When I do this, and use the user control on a form and add columns to the Columns property, I find in the forms Designer in InitializeComponents that the Add method of the collection class is used to add the ColumnHeader variables created. This works.p  pWhat I have trouble doing, however, is syncing the Columns collection property with the Columns properties of the 2 ListView controls. For the inherited collection class inherited from Collection, I cannot override the Add method, so I cant set the Add method to also add the ColumnHeader to the Columns properties of the 2 Listview controls.p  pHow do I assure that the Columns properties of the 2 ListView controls always change to match changes in the user controls Columns propertyp
