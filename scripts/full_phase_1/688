Positive 688 pHi I am creating mobile native application that uses REST API endpoints to communicate with server side.br I have had previous experience developing native clients, but I have simple token random generated string stored in DB in the same table where user information is stored. So it is like sessions used in browser, but instead of cookies each request has token in the header.    p  pRecently I discoreved JWT token. It seems to be great way to secure endpoints which are private. You can request token from mobile client providing you pass  login and get generated token in response.br But the one important thing is that this token is not stored anywhere on the server, server verifies the token using secret word, which is private for the server like private key.br Thats okay for secured endpoints, but what to do if I require user session, for example how do apps like Facebook, Amazon, Aliexpress ... work, they have ability to use the app without providing credentials, just navigating through the store, but require logining in when user wantt to make purchase. And after that user session is kept for some time. This can be implemented with the JWT token without any problems, but when user need to logout, what to do in this case  Token is not stored anywhere on the server, so how can I destroy this token, to make it invalid  p  pIf token is stored in the database, API is not stateless, as REST API should be.  So in general there is no way to keep user logged in in stateless API, am I right     p  pI have some ideas how to implement this using JWT token, but again this will not be stateless API, as I understand.p  ol liCreate the list of expired tokens   li liStore JWT token in the database, but what is the purpose of self descriptive token JWT in this case if it is stored in the database, the main idea of JWT token to keep all information with token, as I know.li ol  pPlease suggest what is the best way will be in this case, and correct me if I have mistaken.br Thanks.p

Positive 688 pI have a set of public APIs that take in an id and some parameters.  Clients could be browsers or mobile phones, each having their own codeintcode ids, can interact with these public APIs.  Of course, we dont want a situation where client changes his id and send a request screwing things up for other people thus, when authentication takes place, a codeGUIDcode is sent to the client as an authentication token.  All subsequent request must include that authentication token.  On the server, the back end does a look up in the DB to match the codeGUIDcode with the id.  If they match, the process can go forward otherwise UnauthorizedAccessException is thrown.  All works fine and dandy.p  pBut of course, the problem is that every operation does a db look up.  I did some caching but then caching the authentication token has its own issues tears tears.  p  pOne other way to do it is to encrypt something and pass it in the query string.  But then when the request comes in, I have decrypt the string to see if its valid.  There is no free lunch there.p  pasp.net sets an encrypted cookie for authentication.  But the view state encrypts things in the hidden field.  The encrypted cookie doesnt work for me since Im passing around JSONSOAP some clients send json some send xml.  p  pIf you actually read all the above, then thank you and I look forward to your input Otherwise and for others, strongthe question isstrong , is there a bestpractice around my dilemma  p
Positive 688 pI have embedded videos on my moodle, which play in sequence  once you have watched one you can watch the next one.

I am wondering if this is a bug on moodle or if there is a way around it. p

Positive 688 pIm just looking for a push in the right direction here. I am trying to create an associate array using a session.

When item is added, the item number and quantity is added to the array. Add another item, it is added. Add the same item, quantity increases by one. Remove an item .. so on and so forth. p  pHopefully you get the idea. Ive got the bones written and am in the testtroubleshoot phase. As Ive said, I think I am creating the array wrong. Id like to create the array empty and add items as needed, but Ive tried a few different ways trying to at least get it working, the one shown above is the most recent. Again, obviously approaching the SESSION associative array all wrong.p  pAny advice would be greatly appreciated Thank you in advance.p

Positive 688 pwe are implementing a Single Sign On process using WSO2 Identity Server. We have both Microsoft and Java web applications involved and we are facing a problem during the Single LogOut processing with Microsoft based web apps. The issue is related to session invalidation on Identity Provider initiated SLO.p  pThis is the scenariop  ul liWSO2 Identity Server with a single Identity Provider configuredli lian Asp.Net MVC application using ComponentSpace SAML2 assembly and Forms authentication marking controllers with the [Authorize] attribute to ensure that users are authenticated to access them.li lithe DEMO Java Web application provided by WSO2 to test SSOli ul  pThe login process works fine. We get a session ID from WSO2 and the user is authenticated landing on WSO2 login form in the first app, and transparently in the sencond one.p  pIn the Asp.Net webapp, when a successfull login occurs, we authenticate the user to access [Authorize] marked controllers calling FormsAuthentication.SetAuthCookieuserName, false . When the user logout from one of the apps, WSO2 sends a SLO request to other partecipants on a configured URI. When this request is reveived by the Microsoft one, we call the FormsAuthentication.SignOut method but the session is not destroyed. If the user refresh the browser page its User.Authenticated property is still True so he can still access [Authorize] marked controllers. This makes sense in my opinion because the caller is WSO2 and not the user browser.p  pWe performed some investigation in the code of the JAR provided by WSO2 for Java applications and it creates a filter on Tomcat implementing a singleton to store WSO2 Session ID relation with Session objects each time a success login operation occurs. When WSO2 request a SLO the filter gets WSO2 Session ID as parameter, accesses the singleton HashTable to retrieve the Session object and calls the Session.Invalidate method of the session object. If the user refreshes the browser, he gets redirected to login page. We tryied to implement something similar on Asp.Net side but even if we get the Session object on server side and call the Session.Abandon method nothing happens when the user refresh the browser.

Let me first explain the situation The Ionic Android app first makes an codehttp.getcode to an url with an password and id. If those 2 match, the backend logs me ON. This means that it remembers that I have access to other urls. It does this with Sessions. p  precodehttpwamp.bart.olen1234logonclientId3amppwdHash098f6bcd4621d373cade4e832627b4f6 codepre  pSo now I can make the second requestp  precodehttpwamp.bart.olen1234configuration codepre  pThis request should give me some data the app needs. If i do the same requests, just in the browserurlbar, in the same order, everything works just fine. The first GET in my app is no problem, it gives me a code200code codeOKcode . But the second GET, that does work in de browserurlbar doesnt work in my Ionic app. It gives me following feedback code403code codeForbiddencode. So it is saying that i dont have logged on yet.p  pI dont know a thing about Cherry Py, thats my colleagues speciality  But I dont know if the problem is located at the backend or frontend.p  pCan someone please check my code to see if I missed something  I think about the following options  my code isnt correct  although it does seem very correct to me   for some reason Ionic and Cherry Pie sessions dont work very well together.   Maybe a bug in de backend  I also thought that maybe my first GET didnt came before my second but Im sure that Im logged On first before I aske the second GET.  I also checkt if the GET urls were the same as i used in the browser bar.p  pThanks. p  pMy controller codep  precode first Get request    scope.checkLogonGegevens  functiongivenUrl, givenClientId, givenPassword       scope.newPassword  md5.createHashgivenPassword         var promise  checkSettings.clientLogongivenUrl, scope.newPassword, givenClientId       promise.then          functionx               scope.logonData  x             scope.vervangGivenVarsgivenUrl, givenClientId , scope.newPassword              scope.vraagConfiguration          ,          functionerrorx              log.error errorx             log.error errorx.status                      some other functie that isnt important     scope.vervangGivenVars  functiongivenUrl, givenClientId, givenPassword       scope.givenUrl  window.localStorage[givenDeviceUrl]  givenUrl       scope.givenClientId  window.localStorage[givenDeviceClientId]  givenClientId       scope.givenPassword  window.localStorage[givenDevicePassword]  givenPassword         second Get request    scope.vraagConfiguration  function       var promise  checkConfiguration.clientConfigurationscope.givenUrl       promise.then          functionx               scope.configData  x             scope.modal.hide          ,          functionerrorx              log.errorerrorx                  codepre  pMy service codep  precodevar modalConfigurationService  angular.modulemodalConfigurationService, []  modalConfigurationService.factorycheckSettings, functionhttp, log   return        clientLogon functionclientUrl, clientPassword, clientId           return http.get clientUrl  logonclientId  clientId  amppwdHash  clientPassword     modalConfigurationService.factorycheckConfiguration, functionhttp, log   return        clientConfiguration functionclientUrl           return http.getclientUrl  configuration    codepre

Positive 688 pIm using the awesome a hrefhttpflask.pocoo.org relnofollowFlask frameworka to create a website in which I use a hrefhttpflasklogin.readthedocs.orgenlatest relnofollowFlasklogina for my user logins. This normally works fine, but sometimes I see strange issues with logins being mixed. Weve got 3 flask devservers running on one machine on different ports and were working in an office with about 10 people with one shared ip. The problem is that sometimes one user is suddenly logged in as another user. p  pI cant really pinpoint when or under which circumstances this happens. But I also dont really know how I can debug it. Could the source of the evil be that we share an internet connection or is the problem that we run several flask devservers on one machinep  pI dont know whether this also happens with people outside of our office were still in testing phase.p  pCan anybody give me some tips on how I can debug thisp

Positive 688 pI have a RESTful Java backend with Jersey. The thing is that I dont know how to implement authorization for the methods. I mean how do I check a user is authorized to use a given method of my REST APIp  pOf course if I look for Jersey authorization, I have those nice annotations like RolesAllowed, PermitAll and DenyAll. However those annotations act against the server realm, with the users of the server, nothing to do with your application users that you store in the database.p  pSo for the sake authorization, what should I do I define a filter that checks if the user is logged in in my application I have to apply the filter to the REST endpoints that need authenticationp  pThis seems a bit like the old days, thats why Im asking the better way to do it.p

Negative 688 pI am starting a new ASP.NET MVC project to learn with, and am wondering whats the optimal way to set up the projects to connect to a SQL server for the data.  For example lets pretend we have a Product table and a product object I want to use to populate data in my view.p  pI know somewhere in here I should have an interface that gets implemented, etc but I cant wrap my mind around it today  p  pEDIT   Right now ie the current, poorly coded version of this app I am just using plain old SQL server2000 even using only stored procedures for data access, but I would not be adverse to adding in an extra layer of flexability for using linq to sql or something.p  pEDIT 2  One thing I wanted to add was this  I will be writing this against a V1 of the database, and I will need to be able to let our DBA rework the database and give me a V2 later, so it would be nice to only really have to change a few small things that are not provided via the database now that will be later.

Negative 688 pI have a problem where a couple 3 dimensional arrays allocate a huge amount of memory and the program sometimes needs to replace them with biggersmaller ones and throws an OutOfMemoryException.p  pExample there are 5 allocated 96MB arrays 200x200x200, 12 bytes of data in each entry and the program needs to replace them with 210x210x210 111MB. It does it in a manner similar to thisp  precodearray1  new Vector3[210,210,210] codepre  pWhere array1array5 are the same fields used previously. This should set the old arrays as candidates for garbage collection but seemingly the GC does not act quickly enough and leaves the old arrays allocated before allocating the new ones  which causes the OOM  whereas if they where freed before the new allocations the space should be enough.p  pWhat Im looking for is a way to do something like thisp  precodeGC.Collectarray1  this would set the reference to null and free the memory array1  new Vector3[210,210,210] codepre  pIm not sure if a full garbage collecion would be a good idea since that code may in some situations need to be executed fairly often.p  pIs there a proper way of doing thisp

Negative 688 pI have a location search a hrefhttpwww.jammulinks.com relnofollowwebsitea for a city, we started out with collecting data for all possible categories in the city like Schools, Colleges, Departmental Stores etc and stored their information in a separate table, as each entry had different details apart from their name, address and phone number. p  pWe had to integrate search in the website to enable people to find information, so we built an index table where in we stored the categories and related keywords for the same category and the table which much be fetched if that category was searched for.

Negative 688 pI am new to the world of J2EE and web app development but am quickly navigating my way around it and learning a lot. Every day is a fantastic voyage of new discovery for me.p  pI am currently working on a project in which I am using Visual JSF Woodstock on Glassfish v2. I am pretty new to JSF also. p  pThere are times when I need to save some objects say MyObject for instance between requests. And from what I have read and understood so far, I need to be using sessions to save these objects between different requests. So far so good.p  pExactly how to do this is where my concern lies. I know that in JSP you can use the codesession.setAttributemyObj, myObjectcode which would save the object at client side using cookies or url rewrites or hidden form variables. p  pOn the other hand, in JSF I use Session scoped beans, say SessionBean1 for e.g., and save objects as SessionBean1 properties e.g. codeSessionBean1.setSomeOjbmyObjcode. Is this the right way to go about with this p  pI am guessing that doing it this way will result in increased memory utilization at the server end since each request will create a new instance of the session scoped bean, SessionBean1 plus the memory utilized by the saved myObject instances in SessionBean1.p  pI have read that you can use codeFacesContext.getExternalContext.getSessiongetSessionMapcode which would save session variables at client side.p  pSo which method would you suggest that I use  the session scoped bean or the sessionmap to save objects for access between requests for a sessionp  pThanks.p

Negative 688 pI have a project that requires the following.p  pFour arrays will be declared in the code as suchp  precodevar ROW1  [module1] var ROW2  [module2, module3] var ROW3  [module4, module5, module6] var ROW4  [module7, module8] codepre  pEach element of these arrays represents a module in a configurable HTML widget. Based on what elements are specified in each array, the code will build an HTML  that represents these modules   each ROWx array will be a table row , and each module will be a table cell  in the table.p  pROW1 can be empty in which case it wont be included in the HTML or have one module, module1.p  pROW2, ROW3, and ROW4 can each have between 0 and 3 modules any of module2  module8, in any order.p  pUsing the example arrays above, Id programmatically generate an HTML table like thisp  precodelttablegt   lttr idrow1gt     lttd colspan6gt[module1]lttdgt   lttrgt   lttr idrow2gt     lttd colspan3gt[module2]lttdgt     lttd colspan3gt[module3]lttdgt   lttrgt   lttr idrow3gt     lttd colspan2gt[module4]lttdgt     lttd colspan2gt[module5]lttdgt     lttd colspan2gt[module6]lttdgt   lttrgt   lttr idrow4gt     lttd colspan3gt[module7]lttdgt     lttd colspan3gt[module8]lttdgt   lttrgt lttablegt codepre  pThe colspans are just there to preserve the proper table layout 6 is the lowest common multiple between 1, 2, and 3.p  pThe problem is, the content for these modules is populated dynamically I get it from an AJAX call to a URL that returns a JSON object, and content is not always available for every module. Rather than creating an empty cell  for a module with no content, I want to remove that cell completely from the layout, acting like it was never in the original configuration i.e. the arrays at top.p  pIve already spent a lot of time creating code that abstracts the module creation  it creates a shell HTML  layout based on how many modules are in each row, and then appends content to the appropriate table cell based on which module should be there. Id like to be able to continue using that code, so I think the best way to do this is to go through each element in the arrays before building the shell , and if I dont have content, remove that element from the array. Then I can use the newly modified array to build the shell per usual  Im basically just processing it beforehand to check for content in each module, and if none is available, acting like that module was never set in the initial array by removing it in the new array and then using that to build the shell .p  pFor example, lets say the configuration is set up as suchp  precodevar ROW1  [module1] var ROW2  [module4, module2] var ROW3  [module5] var ROW4  [module7, module3, module8] codepre  pI want to go through each element in each array and check for available content in the module. Lets say that there is no content available for module3 and module5. I want to then end up with these arraysp  precodevar ROW1  [module1] var ROW2  [module4, module2] var ROW3  [module7, module8] codepre  pPlease note what happened to the rows  since module5 was removed, the elements from the ROW4 array were shifted into ROW3, and ROW4 was then deleted. Also, in the new ROW3 formerly ROW4, module3 was removed, sliding module8 from position [2] into position [1].p  pSop  ul liFor any rows that have one or more elements remaining after removing modules that dont have any content, Id like to keep the row intact, even with only one module.li liFor any rows that end up with no elements remaining, Id like to shift each successive row up one, into the previous array, basically pulling a row out and shifting the lower ones up. The HTML from this example would look like thisli ul  pBEFORE as requested by configurationp  precodelttablegt   lttr idrow1gt     lttd colspan6gt[module1]lttdgt   lttrgt   lttr idrow2gt     lttd colspan3gt[module4]lttdgt     lttd colspan3gt[module2]lttdgt   lttrgt   lttr idrow3gt     lttd colspan6gt[module5]lttdgt   lttrgt   lttr idrow4gt     lttd colspan2gt[module7]lttdgt     lttd colspan2gt[module3]lttdgt     lttd colspan2gt[module8]lttdgt   lttrgt lttablegt codepre  pAFTER based on what content is actually availablep  precodelttablegt   lttr idrow1gt     lttd colspan6gt[module1]lttdgt   lttrgt   lttr idrow2gt     lttd colspan3gt[module4]lttdgt     lttd colspan3gt[module2]lttdgt   lttrgt   lttr idrow3gt     lttd colspan3gt[module7]lttdgt     lttd colspan3gt[module8]lttdgt   lttrgt lttablegt codepre  pRecall that ROW1 is a special case, in that it doesnt affect other rows. If content is available for module1 the only module that can go in ROW1, then ROW1 should exist untouched. If no content is available, then ROW1 can be deleted, but still leaving ROW2, ROW3 and ROW4 asis i.e. not shifting them each up a row. I really only need a solution for handling ROW2, ROW3, and ROW4, since the logic for ROW1 is pretty simple.p  pIm a beginnerintermediate JavaScript programmer, and dont have a lot of experience with arrays. Ive been working on this on and off for hours, but just dont feel that what Im coming up with is a robust or elegantcompact method.p  pIf any JavaScript gurus can share a solution for this, I would VERY much appreciate it Thanks a bunch.p

Negative 688 pI am working on a API to access data stored in a system. The system contains things like people, appointments and procedures associated with those appointments. My application will strictly be readonly. p  pI am using Spring w RowMapper to build objects such a codePersoncode, codeAppointmentcode and codeProcedurecode. I have a DAO for each element. ie codePersonDAO.getByIdcode, codePersonDAO.getByNamecode, ... p  pThe issue comes in that codeAppointmentcode has a reference to a codePersoncode object. An it would be nice in the codePersoncode object to have a reference to that codePersoncodes appointments, but if I begin to load these it becomes a circular reference.p  pSo, I guess my question is the right way to handle this just put the references Ids in the POJOs and then have the business layer just make the right calls to get the information Or is it ok to somehow pass around a reference to the DAO in the actual POJO so that I can lazily load the object objects when referenced But then how do you handle the circular reference When I have a codePersoncode and I lazily load all their appointments, those appointments will also have a Person associated with them. When I load this codePersoncode it could potentially have difference information from the codePersoncode I am loading Appointments for. p  pcodePersoncode object x lazily load  Appointments could lazily load codePersoncode object x.p  pSince codePersoncode could have changed by the time I went to lazily load their appointments. I really need the codePersoncode object in codeAppointmentcode to refer back to the same codePersoncode object.p  pIm getting all caught up on this. I know I could just make it work, but I want to try and find a good solution. I was thinking about using hibernate for this, but thought it was really just overkill. Maybe it isnt.p

Negative 688 pWithin our office, we have a local server running DNS, for internal related domains, e.g. .internal, .office, .lan, .vpn, etc..  Randomly, only the hosts configured with those extensions will stop resolving on the Windowsbased workstations.  Sometimes itll work for a couple weeks without issue on one machine, then suddenly stop working, or itll happen on another 15 times per day.  Its completely random for all workstations.p  pWhen troubleshooting, I have opened up a command prompt, and issued various nslookup commands for some of these hosts, and they resolve, however Ive been told that nslookup uses different libraries for name resolution than other applications such as web browsers, email clients, etc.p  pThe only solution thus far, is manually restarting the Windows DNS Client on each workstation when this happens.

I realize that djangosouth and djangoevolution may come to mind, but I dont really think of these tools as tools meant to be integrated into an application and used by and end user... rather these tools are utilities used for upgrading your database tables.  Im looking for something where I can do something likep  precodeclass MyModelmodels.Model   wouldnt run syncdb.. instead do something like below     a  models.CharField     b  models.CharField  model  MyModel model.create   this runs the create table instead of a syncdb  model.addcolumnc  models.CharField   this would set a column to be added model.alter    and this would apply the alter statement   model.delcolumna    this would set column a for removal  model.alter    and this would apply the removal  codepre  pThis is just a toy example of how such an API would work, but the point is that Id be very interested in finding out if there is a way to programatically create and change tables like this.  This might be useful for things such as content management systems, where one might want to dynamically create a new table.  Another example would be a site that stores datasets of an arbitrary width, for which tables need to be generated dynamically by the interface or data imports.  Dose anyone know any good ways to dynamically create and alter tables like this p  pGranted, I know one can do direct SQL statements against the database, but that solution lacks the ability to treat the databases as objectsp  pJust curious as to if people have any suggestions or approaches to this...p  pJoe p

Negative 688 pWhat is the best way to pack up an IronPython application for deployment After scouring the web the best thing Ive come up with and what Im currently doing is using codeclr.CompileModulescode to glue together my entire projects .py files into one .dll, and then having a single coderun.pycode do this to run the dll p  precodeimport clr clr.AddReferencecompiledapp.dll  import app codepre  pThis is still suboptimal, though, because it means I have top  ol lidistribute 3 files the code.dllcode, the code.xamlcode, and the coderun.pycode launcher li liinstall IronPython on the host machineli ol  pPlus, this feels so... hacky, after the wonderful integration IronPython already has with Visual Studio 2010.

The important part is that its in .exe form.p  hr  pstrongSome edits to clarifystrong I have tried empyc.pyem, but it seems to not acknowledge the fact that my project is not just codeapp.pycode.

Negative 688 pI have a graph of data that Im pulling from an OAuth source using several REST calls and storing relationally in a database.  The data structure ends up having about 510 tables with several onetomany relationships.  Id like to periodically go a reretrieve that information to see if updates are necessary in my database.  p  pSince Im going to be doing this for many users and their data will likely not change very often, my goal is to minimize the load on my database unnecessarily. My strategy is to query the data from my OAuth provider but then hash the results and compare it to the last hash that I generated for the same dataset.  If the hashes dont match, then I would simply start a transaction in the database, blow away all the data for that user, rewrite the data, and close the transaction.  This saves me the time of reading in the data from the database and doing all the compare work to see whats changed, what rows were added, deleted changed etc.p  pSo my question  if I glue all my data together in memory as a big string and use C GetHasCode, is that fairly reliable mechanism to check if my data has changed  Or, are there any better techniques to skinning this catp  pThanksp

Negative 688 pFirst of all, Im not a pro on IIS configuration topic.p  pWith that being said, I got a website written in VB.NET 3.5 Web Forms.

The website and the web service are sharing the same Application Pool.p  pIn IIS Application Pool properties there is a setting Idle Timeout which says Shutdown worker processes after being idle for N time in minutes.  The problem is when the worker process shuts down after N minutes, it is not being started again on any of the AJAX calls from the page.

Which theory do you think is more likely to be correct, and what would your next steps bep  ol liThis is indeed heap corruption.  The verifier isnt catching the original damage because its happening in another DLL.  We should try to activate the verifier for more DLLs and determine what code is damaging the heap.li liThe heap is fine the problem is that we are treating a stack address as a heap address.

Negative 688 pIf you add a listener to a controlview and do not remove it, will that create a memory leak For example, codeonCreatecode adds a listener to an codeEditTextcode that listens for modifications. Do you need to remove this listener in the onDestroyp  pI imagine that if you use an anonymous listener or a local variable that implements the listener, the memory would be freed when the codeActivitycode is destroyed due to scoping rules.p  pThe only way I could see a memory leak potential is if the listener was passed in an intent object.

Negative 688 pIm trying to implement a simple char count of an UITextView while the user is typing in text i.e. it should update continuously.p  pI have two problems.p  p1 The first is that I dont know in which method I should put my charCount method. textViewShouldBeginEditing doesnt work, as it simply asks if an editing session should begin. textViewshouldChangeTextInRange doesnt work either, as it again asks if it is permitted to begin editing. I couldnt find other useful methods in the Apple doc.p  p2 Next problem I tried to call my charCount method from within another method. But I get the compiler error ViewController may not respond to charCount.p  pHere is my humble attempt p  precode IBActioncharCountidsender    all chars int charsAsInt  inttextView.text.length NSString newText  [[NSString alloc] initWithFormatAll chars d, charsAsInt] allCharacters.text  newText [newText release]   BOOLtextViewShouldBeginEditingUITextView aTextView       [self charCount] codepre  pI guess it has to do with me trying to call a IBAction defined method that this wont work. But what would be the proper way to call a IBAction method from within a nonIBAction methodp  pAs always, Im sorry for these very basic questions and I do appreciate every little help to get my beginners mind around this.p
Negative 688 pMost of this is background, skip the next 3 paragraphs for the question  p  pI have developed a tool that calls some installers, changes registry items, and moves files around to help me test a product which has a fairly fast update cycle. So far so good, I have a GUI which runs in a separate process to the business logic to prevent it locking due to the GIL, everything works etc, however I have concerns with a section of my code where I make calls to msiexec.  p  pSpecifically its the uninstall part which gives me concerns. Currently the GUID does not change so I am able to uninstall the product using an codeos.systemmsiexec x GUID passivecode sort of thing. Its actually a bit more complicated as Im using subprocess.Popen and polling it until it finished from within an event loop to allow for concurrency with other steps.  p  pMy concern is that should the GUID change, obviously this will not work. I dont want to point msiexec directly at the installation source, as this would mean that it wouldnt work if I were to lose the msi file, which I store in a temporary directory.  p  pWhat I am looking for, is a way of querying by program name to get the GUID, or even a wrapper for msiexec that would do all of this, including the uninstall, for me. I thought of scanning through the registry, but the winreg module seems very slow, so Id prefer to avoid this if at all possible. If theres a better way to scan the registry, Im all ears, as this would speed up other parts of the tool also.p  hr  h2Update0h2  pPerformance on this is critical as one of the design goals is to make the process which the tool follows faster than any other method, manual or otherwise, in order to gain wholesale adoption.p  hr  h2Update1h2  pI have tried a slight variation of the registry version below however it consistently returns codeNonecode.

This is iterated over to render the form elements for each book.p  pLets imagine that my only validation rule is that book title is required.p  pIf the user fails to enter any book titles, then I want to highlight all relevant book title textboxes using a css class and display an alert that says Book title is required just once.p  pId like to use the jQuery validation plugin to achieve this.p  pThe a hrefhttpdocs.jquery.comPluginsValidationvalidate relnofollowdocumentationa tells us that if we want to set a custom error message for an element we do this using the codenamecode attribute of the relevant HTML form element in a codemessagescode section of the codevalidatecode setup call.p  pe.g. where my HTML element has a codenamecode of emtitleemp  precode.selector.validate     rules          title required,     ,     messages          title Book titles must be set,       codepre  pHowever, this seems incompatible with how ASP.NET MVC model binding needs to use the codenamecode attribute, when binding to a list as it makes use of the codenamecode property of each form element using a very specific syntax, e.g.p  precodeltform methodpost actionHomeCreategt      ltinput typetext name[0].Title valueCurious George gt     ltinput typetext name[0].Author valueH.A.

Negative 688 pI have an activity with a download button. When i click on it a service is started. The service create a notification and post it in the notification bar. If i show the notification details i can see a progrees bar showing th download status.p  pCause i didnt know that a service runs on the main thread, someone suggested me to use an intentservice that create a worker thread by itself. SO everything is fine and my gui doesnt freeze during the download.p  pI have one problem. To use intentservice i had to implement the download code and the notification part inside the method onHandleIntent. Now i found out that an intentservice has a kind of queue that manage intents once per time . SO if i click the download button from the activity twice it crate a new notification, starts the download and then when it has finished it enter onHandleIntent again,it creates the second notification and starts the second download. For me its fine to download files back to back and not together, but at least i would like that if i press twice the download button the serivce upload the notifications saying that there are 2 downloads waiting. Im not able to do that cause the intent service do the code once and the once again..........Is there a way to fix itp  pIs there a way to handle the queue manually saying something like....if you get another intent do this........update notification.......and then continue with the dirst download....p  pANother question, can a intent service modify the gui considering that is working on another thread or i have to use an handler and send a message back to the activityp  pAnd last, whwere is the thread created,  justa after the onCreated method or inside the onHandleIntentp

Negative 688 pIm building an API for my site and Im faced with a problem.  I want my users to be able to log in to their account using the API, but my site doesnt utilize a usernamepassword system, it uses Twitters API and a cookiesession for authentication.  Im trying to think of the best way to allow users to post data using the API without compromising security.  Basically I need a way to make sure that the user is who they say they are from within the application.p  pOne idea I was thinking of was to have the user create a password which they would use to log in through a method in the API.  Sending the proper credentials Twitter username and their selected password to this method would return a token which would be associated with their account.  To go even further, I could set the token essentially an API key as inactive initially and have the API also return a secret code which would also be associated with the users account.  The user would then have to log into their profile on the site and enter the secret code, which would activate their token and allow them to post using the API.p  pI want to make it simple for the user, but I dont want to potentially compromise other users security.  Can anyone suggest a better way of doing something like this, or let me know if the way Ive suggested would be a good way of doing itp

Negative 688 pI have a User Control with completely custom drawn graphics of many objects which draw themselves called from OnPaint, with the background being a large bitmap.

And an object which has a rectangle starting at point 100,100 on the bitmap, would appear at point 200,200 on the screen provided you were scrolled to the far left.p  pBasically what I need to do is create an efficient way of redrawing only what needs to be redrawn.  For example, if I move an object, I can add the old clip rectangle of that object to a region, and union the new clip rectangle of that object to that same region, then call Invalidateregion to redraw those two areas.p  pHowever doing it this way means I have to constantly convert the objects bitmap coordinates into screen coordinates before supplying them to Invalidate.

They can click 2 on a row, then click 3 on the same row, but that leaves all other 2 and 3 options disabled completely.li liThe user needs a way to completely clear the form via a start over or reset button that apparently needs some special jQuery magic that I havent been able to figure out yet.li liI took code referenced in another post a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netX6zKa relnofollowfrom this urla, but it seems to only half work on my site. I notice on that fiddle link that if you click 1, it also disables 2 and 3 on the same row, which doesnt happen on my local development attempt. It does, however, permanently disable 2 in other rows if you were to click 2...so Im unsure why it works in the example but not my code above. li ol  pTheres got to be some easier way around this that Im just not seeing here.

Negative 688 pIve looked for this question on stackoverflow, but didnt found a really good answer for it.p  pI have a MySQL database with a few tables with information about a specific product. When end users use the search function in my application, it should search for all the tables, in specific columns. p  pBecause the joins and many where clauses where not performing really well, I created a stored procedure, which splits all the single words in these tables and columns up, and inserts them in the table. Its a combination of word and productID.  This table contains now over 3.3 million records.p  pAt the moment, I can search pretty quick if I match on the whole word, or the beginning of the word LIKE searchterm. This is obvious, because it uses an index right now.p  pHowever, my client want to search on partial words LIKE searchterm. This isnt performing at all. Also FULLTEXT search isnt option, because it can only search for the beginning of a word, with a wildcard after it.p  pSo what is the best practice for a search function like thisp

Negative 688 pIf you have a method name and an array of parameter types a signature, you can use reflection to get a MethodInfo and invoke the method.p  precodeMethodInfo info  myObj.GetType.GetMethodMethodName, new object[]  typeofstring, typeofint   info.InvokemyObj, new object[] Hello, 22 codepre  pInvoking a MethodInfo in this manner is very slow.  To speed it up, we can create a map that has wrappers to the MethodInfo that invoke the method using the Expression API or using Reflection.Emit.p  pHowever, doing so requires that we maintain a map of signatures to MethodInfo wrappers.  To do this, we need a key that represents the NameSignature so we can quickly find the required MethodWrapper from our map if it exists when trying to invoke a method.

Otherwise, this approach can be used to parse both sample strings first and second, provided the regex is modified for tilde and pipe symbols accordingly.  Excellentp  pBut the real problem pertains to the multiline criteria.  Before a regex can be applied to a string, I must read the full logical row from the file.  Unfortunately, I dont know how many physical rows to read to complete the logical row, unless Ive got a regex  state machine.  p  pSo this becomes a chicken and the egg problem.  My best option would be to read the entire file into memory as one giant string, and let the regex sortout the multiple lines I didnt check if the above regex could handle that.  If Ive got a 10 gig file, this could be a bit precarious. p  pOn to the next option.p  pemTextFieldParseremp  pThree lines of code will make the problem with this option apparentp  precodevar reader  new Microsoft.VisualBasic.FileIO.TextFieldParserstream reader.Delimiters  new string[]    reader.HasFieldsEnclosedInQuotes  true codepre  pThe Delimiters configuration looks good.  However, the HasFieldsEnclosedInQuotes is game over.  Im stunned that the delimiters are arbitrarily configurable, but in contrast I have no other qualifier option other than quotations.  Remember, I need configurability over the text qualifier.  So again, unless someone knows a TextFieldParser configuration trick, this is game over.p  pemOLEDBemp  pA colleague tells me this option has two major failings.  First, it has terrible performance for large e.g. 10 gig files.  Second, so Im told, it guesses data types of input data rather than letting you specify.  Not good.p  pstrongHELPstrongp  pSo Id like to know the facts I got wrong if any, and the other options that I missed.  Perhaps someone knows a way to juryrig TextFieldParser to use an arbitrary delimiter.  And maybe OLEDB has resolved the stated issues or perhaps never had them.p  pWhat say yep

Negative 688 pIm trying to implement an script that reads the contentfiles and folders of a certain directory and writes it in a database. My goal is create an software that allows me to organize those files and folders relating description and tags to them, without affecting the correspondig physical files in the disk. But for now Im facing a logical problem How do I make a direct connection between that physical file and the database register I want that, even if the physical file, for some reason, is edited or moved to another folder inside the root directory, the software is still able to relate that file with its original register in the database.p  pMy first idea was to use a checksum hash to identify every file but, Im guessing that if the file is edited, so does the hash, doesnt it Besides that, I also think that a folder itself cant be checked that way.p  pAnother solution that came up to my mind was applying a unique key in the beginning of every file and folder name in the directory. That may work, but it seems to me like an improvised solution and, therefore, Imhoping that there may be another way to do it that I havent considered yet. Does anyone have an advice on thatp

Negative 688 pThis is more of an architectural question than a technological one per se.p  pI am currently building a business websitesocial network that needs to store large volumes of data and use that data to draw analytics consumer behavior.p  pI am using Django and a PostgreSQL database.p  pNow my question is I want to expand this architecture to include a data warehous. The ideal would be the operational DB would be the current Django PostgreSQL database, and the data warehouse would be something additional, preferably in a multidimensional model.p  pWe are still in a very early phase, we are going to test with 50 users, so something primitive such as a onecolumn table for starters would be enough.p  pI would like to know if somebody has experience in this situation, and that could recommend me a framework to create a data warehouse, all while mantaining the operational DB with the Django models for ease of use if possible.p  pThank you in advance p

Negative 688 pI have inherited a large flash script written in AS2 which runs an experiment and saves data using the codeSharedObjectcode framework.  This script will be given to users to run on their local machines, probably on a USB drive or a CD.  What is the easiest way to transfer the locally stored codeSharedObjectcode either to this USB drive or to send it electronically  Is it possible to store the codeSharedObjectcode in the same location as the swf file e.g., on the USB drive  I see that hooking up flash with PHP is possible, but is there a purely flash way to send this data via email, ftp or another protocol to a serverp

Negative 688 pIm trying to figure out how to make noneditable text not a JTextField whose background color changes when the mouse rolls over it. I tried using JButton implementing ActionListener and hiding elements to make the button appear to be just text, but it only allows me to change icons on rollover and detect when the button is clicked. Another thought was to use MouseListener and declare the specific coordinates of a rectangle around the text, where upon mouseMoved it could initiate the highlight. But w that theres a problem for varying string lengths and word wrap etc. What is the best object, and listener combo to achieve the effect of a highlighted text field on mouse rollover p

Negative 688 pI am trying to add an object to an codeNSMutableDictionarycode using the codesetObjectforKeycode function, but for whatever reason, when I run my app in the iPhone simulator and try to perform the action, the code stops at the line were I am trying to add the object to the dictionary. The line where the program gets stuck is as followsp  precode[dict setObjecttf.text forKey[NSString stringWithFormatkeywordsi, [keywordsArray count]]] codepre  pWhere dict is an codeNSMutableDictionarycode object, tf is a codeUITextFieldcode, and keywordsArray is an codeNSMutableArraycode.p  pOverall, I am using the objects aka keys from my dictionary to populate an codeNSMutableArraycode, which is used to fill a codeUIPickerViewcode. Initially, I load the dictionary from a .plist file, and I can tell the codeNSMutableDictionarycode and the codeNSMutableArraycode are both getting populatedfilled correctly, and that the codeUIPickerViewcode is working fine, the only part that isnt working is adding objects to the codeNSMutableDictionarycode when the user presses a button in the UI. Also, I did get an error once that said that the codeNSMutableArraycode had a count of 0 zero, when clearly it didnt.p  pAny helpsuggestions would be greatly appreciatedp
Negative 688 pSo I have this existing bit of code that compiles perfectly in Visual Studio 2005, when the target platform is 32 bit. However, it does not work in 64 bit.

Negative 688 pI want to implement a screen deisgn and functionality where user can rearrange the controls dynamically and save the layout in to database.p  pBefore starting off this, I am looking for a technical expertise for some useful tipsinputssuggestions to make the decision on how to implement this successfully.p  pAssume I have a screen with Grid panel which has 2 columns and 10 rows. Each cell has a Grid panel which inturn contains controls like label, textbox, combobox, checkbox, etc.p  pBut overall each cell contains one child grid panel.p  pReuirementp  pDuring runtime, User should be able to rearrangedrag and drop these child grid panels as per hisher wish and also should be able to save the layout into the database.p  pIf the user opens the same screen next time, the modified layout must be shown.p  pSuggestions are welcomep

Negative 688 pI seem to have found that post multiplying a vector with a matrix in a a vertex shader works on my desktop machine but not on my Android phone.p  pIm using libGDX and GLES2.0 to write a game. I got a decent chunk of it working on desktop, but when I tried to run it on Android it just showed blank clearcolor. By messing around I discovered the problem was only there when I was using a matrix in my vertex shader. The vertex shader in question isp  precodeattribute vec3 aVertPos attribute vec2 aTexCoord  uniform mat4 uCamMatrix uniform vec3 uPosition uniform vec2 uSize  varying vec2 vTexCoord  void main    vTexCoord  aTexCoord    vec3 scale  vec3uSize,0.0   vec4 dest  vec4aVertPosscaleuPosition,1.0  uCamMatrix   glPosition  dest  codepre  pI found I still got the blank screen even if I passed uCamMatrix as an identity matrix. Utterly puzzled, I looked around at other shaders and  without expecting a result  switched the order of the matrix and vector in that linep  precodevec4 dest  uCamMatrix  vec4aVertPosscaleuPosition,1.0 codepre  pI had been transposing the matrix before passing it, so I stopped doing that since I was changing the order. This totally fixed the issue.p  pThe desktop version looks the same as it always did, so the calculation result must be the way it was before.p  pSo does AndroidGLES20 have some quirk about matrix multiplication Is this a bug Am I just missing something obviousp

Negative 688 pI am making an app that should play a simple audio track and let me know if there is any noise in the vicinity while the track is playing. This is done by doing a live recording from the microphone while the song plays on the iPhones loudspeaker. Any sound that is not part of the music playing is defined as noise. p  pWhat would be the simplest way to implement this functionalityp  pIve researched it quite extensively online but I have not been able to find anything that points me to a solution for this specific problem. Although it may be a combination of different techniques I read about that eventually will be the solution.p  pstrongThings Ive already implementedstrongbr Playing the song and recording audio simultaneously.p  pstrongThings Ive triedstrongbr NOTE Since were encouraged to add what weve already tried I add the following part. But Im by no means saying that this is the right way to solve the problem, its just something I tried.  p  pI hacked the aurioTouch2 sample application what I did was playback the song once and record the fast fourier transform values at a pretty low sample rate to keep the amount of recorded data low. Then when the track was played again I would basically calculate per timestep the correlation coefficient between the output graphs that are constructed using the live playback fft data and the recorded fft data so the squiggly lines that you see when you put the app in fft mode.br This sort of works. The correlation coefficient is clearly lower when excess soundnoise is in the room but it isnt very sensitive and also depends on the volume level that was used when recording the fft data. In the end Im thinking that this may not be the best approach.p  pDoes anyone think this is possible If so, what would be the best approachbr Please ask if you need more clarificationp

Negative 688 pI have a Qt application that requires the ability to load from several settings files to behave in a distinct way. For example lets say my app can support several variations, VAR1, VAR2, VAR3, ...  One of my menu entries allows me to load settings. Currently, I do this using a QSettings object and it works fine. But now I want to implement a different variation. Instead of manually setting 20 or more settings, I would like to load from a preconfigured settings file.p  pQSettings does not allow me to change source, as far as I can tell. I looked at the static method QSettingssetPath but that can only be done once prior to instantiating the QSettings object.p  pMy hope is to create ways to   1  Load factory defaults   2  Save a user settings file with a user specified name   3  Recall a user settings file by name.p  pI would prefer not to have to rewrite QSettings to meet my needs if at all possible.p

Is there some way using jquery or php to do thisp  precode    ltnavgt         ltulgt             ltligtItemltligt             ltligtItemltligt             ltligtItemltligt             ltligtItemltligt             ltligtItemltligt             ltligtItemltligt             ltligtItemltligt         ltulgt         ltulgt             ltligtItemltligt             6 ...         ltulgt         ltulgt             ltligtItemltligt             6 ...         ltulgt     ltnavgt codepre  pIm thinking something like a nthchild thing, or a php counter.p
Negative 688 pI want to create a workbook that would help people log their eating habits. The workbook currently has two sheets, Recipes and Diary. p  pRecipes has columns ID, NAME, KCAL and PROTEIN. The user can add any recipes they frequently use, and just refer to them using the numeric ID.p  pDiary has columns DATE, TOTALKCAL and TOTALPROTEIN. The idea is for each date the user could see the total amount of energy and protein eaten.p  pI have already figured out how to get the kcal and protein amounts of a single recipe from the recipes sheet into the diary sheet using VLOOKUPp  precodeVLOOKUP1Table13FALSE For kcal codepre  pbut I really would like to automate this a bit. At this stage if I want to use this sheet I need to copy the whole function and add a  prefix, paste it at the end and change the first parameter to the correct ID. Then I have to repeat this process also to the TOTALPROTEINS column where I need to remember to change the source parameter from 3 to 4.p  pI guess the optimal situation would be if the Diary sheet also had some EATENRECIPES column, where people could add a list of IDs 1,15,6 but I have no idea if this is possible in excel. The point is, I want to be able to write down an ID to diary and have excel automatically fetch the kcal and protein amounts from the recipes sheet and update the total amount in the diary.p  pThis is probably quite a simple matter, but I have no idea what search words to use in google, any comments on this are appreciated. Also I need a better title.p

Negative 688 pI want to use ASP.NET SimpleMembership to authenticate users that consume my WebAPI.

All XML files should successfully validate against one of our XSD schemas. The XSD schemas are quite complex, so creating XML files by hand for testing is prohibitive.  We want a collection of testing XML files that will exercise the limits of the input data so having a single XML data file will not be sufficient. Ideally, it would be nice to have a tool which allows a tester to pick a few values for each XML tag the max value, the min value, a zero value, a negative value, etc and then the tool will generate collections of XML files using combinations of those testerchosen values. p  pThe system is being tested upon a Microsoft Windows XP environment, but we could certainly generate the XML testing files upon a different environment if a particular tool could help automate this. We would like this XMLgenerationfromXSD capability for testing purposes and we do not need it within the application itself, so a standalone XMLgeneration tool could be used if one exists. p  prelated question It seems that the only existing tool I found that even attempts this task is jCAM main project site is at a hrefhttpsourceforge.netprojectscamprocessor relnofollowhttpsourceforge.netprojectscamprocessora list of jCAM capabilities and tutorial available at a hrefhttpswww.oasisopen.orgcommitteesdownload.php29661XSD20and20jCAM20tutorial.pdf relnofollowhttpswww.oasisopen.orgcommitteesdownload.php29661XSD20and20jCAM20tutorial.pdfa.

Negative 688 pIm very new to coding and am creating an online system. Part of the system I have included Google Distance Matrix API which is JavaScript, whereas most of my other code is HTML or PHP.

I read I could use AJAX Im not terribly sure about what Im doing but I had a go.p  pBefore the page that includes the Google Map, there is a form. This means I have to use SESSION variables to move the data from the page before the Google page, to two pages after the Google page.. this is also where my Google script gets its two locations to find the distance between.

Negative 688 pI want to implement a generic tree data structure in C that has a class codeTreeltEgtcode which references a root codeTreeNodeltEgtcode object that contains a linked list of children and a single parent of the same node type. This is a basic tree structure and I dont really have any problems implementing this part.p  pI want to extend this tree structure to create codeFunctioncode, which extends codeTreeltdoublegtcode, along with its compliment node type codeExpressioncode which appropriately extends codeTreeNodeltdoublegtcode. I want to use this structure to represent mathematical functions which can be evaluated with the functions appropriate variables.p  pIm currently in the design phase of this project so there are many ways I could implement this but Im looking for the design that has the appropriate level of abstraction to cover all types of functions while still keeping their parameter signatures airtight. For instance, I should be able to create a codeFunctioncode in runtime for the mathematical functionsp  pcodef  42code, codefx  x2code, codefx, y  xy  5code, etc.p  pIf every codeExpressioncode has its own list of children subexpressions which break down to define the process of the function given its arguments, then codeExpressioncode should utilize some sort of evaluation method which takes in codedoublecode values and spits out their scalar values or if possible, extract this to the Vector level.p  pIm not too experienced with functional languages like LINQ, but if anybody is, would there be a simple and powerful way to implement what Im planning using that It would be fantastic if I didnt have to create concrete classes for every sort of basic operation like codeSinExpressionXcode or codeAdditionExpressionX,Ycode ones, but instead be able to define mathematical functions on the fly that could potentially be stored in a Dictionary, providing that all variables are going to either be other expressions, or boil down to floatingpoint values. At that point, concrete function classes could extend these abstracted ones if I needed to just by defining the evaluation function in the base constructor.p  pI also want to note that its important to maintain the tree structure, because I plan to utilize these expressions in a separate program that will directly change a functions expression tree changing nodes, removing branches, etc.p  pCan anybody point me in the right direction I would greatly appreciate it.p

I tried the following copy functionp  precodeprivate void CopyGraphicsPathWrap gpw   DataObject obj  new DataObject   obj.SetDatatypeofGraphicsPathWrap, gpw   Clipboard.SetDataObjectobj  codepre  pThen tried the following paste functionp  precodeprivate GraphicsPathWrap Paste    return GraphicsPathWrapClipboard.GetDataObject.GetDatatypeof   GraphicsPathWrap  codepre  pIt should work, but the GetData... returns an object of type MemoryStream and an InvalidCastException was thrown. I dont understand why its type of MemoryStream. I thought it should be able to be casted to GraphicsPathWrap I can work around this by using a BinaryFormatter to deserialize the MemoryStream but its too ridiculous when Clipboard cant do all the thing for mep  pThanksp

Negative 688 pIs it conceptually possible to have a tree where you traverse it by starting at a given leaf node rather than the root node and use parent pointers to get to the rootp  pI ask this since I saw someone implement a tree and they used an array to hold all of the leaf nodesexternal nodes and each of the leafexternal nodes point only to their parent nodes and those parent point to their parent node etc. until you get to the root node which has no parents. Their implementation thus would require you to start at one of the leaves to get to anywhere in the tree and you would cannot go down the tree since her tree nodes do not have any children pointers, only parent pointers.p  pI found this implementation interesting since I havent seen anything like it but I was curious if it could still be considered it a tree. I have never seen a tree where you start traversal at the leaves, instead of root. I have also never seen a tree where the tree nodes only have parent pointers and no children pointers.p
Negative 688 pI have a 1Gb network and I need to run certain TCP performance tests by limiting the rate to 100MB and then 1Gb. My understanding is that hierarchical token bucket htb can be used to achieve this as shown belowp  precodetc qdisc add dev eth0 root handle 1 htb default 12 tc class add dev eth0 parent 1 classid 11 htb rate 1gbps ceil 1gbps tc class add dev eth0 parent 1 classid 110 htb rate 100mbps ceil 100mbps codepre  pThis should create two root classes 11 and 110, with 1gb and 100mb bandwidth respectively. Please correct me if my understanding is wrong.p  pNext, how do i use the above classes in my tcp application For example when i run my application, which should use only 100 Mb, do i need to specify something in socket options, such that any messages sent by the application now belong to class 11 and hence get rate limited to 100 Mbp

Negative 688 pI am looking into migrating from Tomcat to Jetty 8 for a custom web application that will essentially be a portal though it wont be using a JSR168 or similar portal container.  The key concept for the purposes of this post is that the user will only need to log in once, and then he will need to access URLs from several different web applications all running on the same Jetty server.  Once the user has logged in they should automatically be authenticated to any other web application running on the server.p  pTomcat has the org.apache.catalina.authenticator.SingleSignOn valve which accomplishes this exact task.  Once you log into a web application, the SingleSignOn valve will automatically log you into any other web applications.p  pSo, is there a similar way to provide this same functionality in Jetty 8  It seems that there is a separate SessionManager for each web application.  Can you configure or programatically assign the same SessionManager instance to each web application  Is there some other solution that is provided by Jetty out of the boxp

The script succesfully saves the file as p  precodesomeparameters.txt codepre  pbut when I then list the files in terminal I seep  precodemsomeparameters.txt codepre  pThe file name without the m is still valid and trying to call the file with the m returns p  precode ls m No such file or directory codepre  pSo I think the m has some special meaning of which numerous google searches do not yields answers. While I can carry on without worrying, I would like to know the cause. Here is how I create the file in pythonp  precode chi,epsI etc are all floats. Make a string for the file name filename  chisepsIsepsAsomega0setas.txt  chi,epsI,epsA,omega0,eta    a.out is the compiled c file which outputs data os.system.a.out gt  s  filename  codepre  pAny advise would be much appreciated, usually I can find the answer already posted in the stackoverflow but this time Im really confused. p

Negative 688 pI tried to create a Maze with a moving ball and a hole using the Accelerometer Sensor. With the following code, the ball falls into the hole, but the performance is really bad, I set the Accelerometer Frequency to the fastest, but its everything other than smooth.

Is there another way to do itp  pThe performance is also really bad, i set the AccelerometerSensorDelay to the fastest, but the ball doesnt run smooth. When I remove the line codecanvas.drawBitmapbitmap, 0, 0, paintcode, then the ball is smoother, but then the wooden background is away. p

Negative 688 pIve searched through the list of warnings in the Lint Error Checking preferences but cant find it. The list is a bit too long to check every warning to see if its the one I want, and filtering the warnings with codenamecode, codenumbercode, codenumericcode, codeinputTypecode, etc, does not bring up the warning. Hovering the mouse over the warning doesnt seem to provide the strongwarning IDstrong.p  pI have a good reason for using a text codeinputTypecode for a variable with number in its name, which is that I want to log in to a server which uses a number as a login ID, therefore I need the number as a string. I dont really like having the warning there, Id like to disable that specific warning if possible.p  pThanks.p

Negative 688 pI hope i am not alone in noticing that various versions of jQuery tend to have strange nonshowstopper errors that get thrown but which are caught, and yet this tends to set off the debugger on Chrome andor Safari in inconsistent ways even when the browsers are are set to Break or Pause on uncaught exceptions. p  pIt really should just not break there because these exceptions strongdostrong get caught, as the console never gains the unsightly red error log, but like I said sometimes they pause the debugger there, and it costs me a few seconds each debug iteration to step past them. p  pIt is strange and inconsistent, and I dont know whether it is the fault of Webkit, or ChromeSafari, or jQuery code, but whichever it is, I dont have the resources to go wild goose chasing this one. I am working on my project today and currently Chrome codeVersion 27.0.1453.94 mcode on Windows 7 is able to pass over these exceptions when set to only pause on uncaught exceptions, but Safari code6.0.4 8536.29.13code on code10.8.3 12D78code, a rMBP 2012, still hangs up on them. p  pThe exceptions are originating in codejquery2.0.0b2.jscode on lines code3668code and code3686code. I have definitely seen this happen before on 1.9.1 or 1.9.2 or 1.8.3 it must have been one of those, i just dont remember which.p  pIs there a featureextension that can let me specify strongantibreakpointsstrongp

Negative 688 pI am creating a threaded messaging system for a web application, much like in Facebooks messaging system. I followed the other database schemes for threaded messages here in StackOverflow, but I havent seen my requirement in theirs.p  pSo I have three tablesp  precodeConversations      conversationId  Messages     messageId     conversationId     body  Participants     conversationId     userId codepre  pIf a user creates a new conversation, a new conversation record is created in the codeConversationscode table. The body of the message, along with subsequent replies, are stored in the codeMessagescode table with the conversationId. Finally, the participants, both the sender and 1 or more receivers, are added to the codeParticipantscode table.p  pFor example, person A sends person B a message. If the conversation between A and B does not exist yet, it should create a new conversation with a new ID. But if A and B already has a record, it should just add the message to the codeMessagescode table with the existing conversation ID. If A sends B and C, thats a new thread and should not be included with the last conversation.p  pIf the user creates a new conversation to someone he already had conversation with person A and B already had an existing conversation, the messaging app should not create another conversation Id but just get the conversationId with all the participants existing. p  pWhat I want to know is how to find out which conversation I should append the new message to. How should I formulate my query to get the conversation Id with the exact participants If the participant userIds do not match, it should return 0. Is there a better database scheme to suit my requirementp

Negative 688 pI made a simple application in KineticJS. In my app I need to create a few circles, which can be drag and drop and I need to detect collision between them. Now I have 6 bubbles circle, I can move them and also detect collision using the dragmove event. Its works, bubbles run away from the bubble Im dragging. But I need detect collision between other bubble as well. How i can do this I dont see move event only mousemove.

Negative 688 pI was checking into whether I could use spaces safely in a name attribute and the overwhelming consensus apart from one answer which the community said was incorrect was that it is just fine, because the Name attribute uses CDATA token instead of a Name token, or something along those lines.

Negative 688 pA number of very useful answers posted in this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions19074867javaserialisedobjectvsnonserialisedobjectthreada helped clear my questions around serialization. From the responses I understand that it is just a means to persist and recreate data in a jvm.So serialization is used for recreating a java object from byte stream. However data could be transferred by means of XML  JSON or via any other data format. So could this be called as serialization I assume that the difference is that the relevant java libraries would recreate the object using byte stream  xml data  json data etc based on the format of data passed. In case of communication between 2 java based systems, I assume bytestream would be useful where as in case of communication between 2 systems working in different technologies other standard data formats will be used. In case of EJBs  Java RMI , I assume the objects that are transferred between client and server must be serialised as I assume java would be using standard serialization apis to deserialize the objects. Are all these listed above correctp

Its having lot of drawbacks, including when the page gets refreshed, momentarily the user sees HTML tags before the page is loaded completely. p  pCan you please suggest any reference for fixing these two issues  p  ol liRefreshing Data in Multiple Textares of a HTMLFORM on click of Button inside HTMLFORM using AJAX li liAvoiding momentary display of HTML code in Text area     before page is completely loaded.li ol  pUpdated CODE is mentioned below p  precodeltDOCTYPE htmlgt lthtmlgt ltheadgt lttitlegtTestlttitlegt ltheadgt ltbodygt     ltformgt         ltinput idid typehidden nameidgt         ltpgtQuestionltpgt         ltp idmyInstance3 styleborder 1px solid 000gtlttextarea idquest readonlygtlttextareagtltpgt         ltpgtOption Altpgt         lttextarea idopta gtlttextareagt         ltpgtOption Bltpgt         lttextarea idoptb gtlttextareagt         ltpgt             ltbutton idpreviousgtPreviousltbuttongt             ltbutton idnextgtNextltbuttongt         ltpgt     ltformgt ltscript srchttpajax.googleapis.comajaxlibsjquery2.0.3jquery.min.jsgtltscriptgt ltscript typetextjavascriptgt  var array  [id1,questltpgtABCltpgt,optaA,optbB, id2,questltpgtDEFltpgt,opta1,optb2]     var ArrayWalker  function           var array  null,             index  0,             walk   function step                  if array  null                      throw Array is not initialized                                  index  step                 if index lt 0  index  array.length                      index  step                                  return array[index]                      return              init function array                  array  array                 index  0             ,             current function                   return walk0             ,             next function                   return walk1             ,             previous function                   return walk1             ,             index function seek                  if seek  undefined                      index  window.parseIntseek                                  return index                                 function fillElementsdata          id.valdata[id]         quest.valdata[quest]         opta.valdata[opta]         optb.valdata[optb]           ArrayWalker.initarray     fillElementsArrayWalker.current      previous.clickfunction e          e.preventDefault         fillElementsArrayWalker.previous          next.clickfunction e          e.preventDefault         fillElementsArrayWalker.next      ltscriptgt ltscript srchttpjs.nicedit.comnicEditlatest.js typetextjavascriptgtltscriptgt ltscript typetextjavascriptgt      bkLib.onDomLoadedfunction            var myNicEditor  new nicEditor           myNicEditor.setPanelmyNicPanel           myNicEditor.addInstancemyInstance3         ltscriptgt  ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre

Negative 688 pI have two pictures, one that was the original and another one that I have modified so that its translated up and left a bit and then rotated 90 degrees so the shape of the picture is transposed as well.p  pNow Id like to determine how many pixels or any distance unit the modified picture is translated from the original, as well as the degrees of rotation relative to the original.

Negative 688 pI have a situation which keeps coming up all the time when I think its over. Its a ASP.NET project but I am not using ASP.NET AJAX elemets and any server side elements in design part. I am using ASP.NET to handle database operations and using jQuery elements in design, also using only jQuery AJAX to send and receive data from UI.p  pI have a method which runs when an ajax call is made and returns an object class with a DateTime element in it. I need to use what returns in a javascript function to show on the screen. I dont want to use JSON.NET or anything else to serialize the returning class beacuse ASP.NET does all the conversions when I return an object class, itself already.p  pSo, my problem is I am getting a long date format which is not compatible with any javascript function and none of moment.js or date.js libraries supporting that format. The output of the datetime asp.net object in javascript is likep  pSun Aug 11 2013 000000 GMT 0300 Turkey Daylight Timep  pI looked for some info about that for days and didnt find any questions or articles explaining how to cast returning datetime properly. May be not looking for the right thing...p  pI know that I can create a JSON string and send that class values with it. Ive been there. But my head starts hurting when I start to question strongthe logic of asp.net automatically serializing returning classes and returning a non useful datetime objectstrong.p  pSo, I decided to hear your opinions on that matter. What is the best way of dealing datetime conversion issues in asp.netp  ol liI can change the DateTime object to a simple string and get the value as string and cast it to datetime in asp.net and return the same class with a string like a date object, but that is creating other casting problems in javascript side DDMMYYYY and MMDDYYYY issues.li liI can look for a way to properly cast the returning datetime format of asp.net to javascript form which I believe is after a lot of research is quite impossibleli liI can create my class which would include a long int object and cast serialize that datetime object to JSON format before sending as a return call in asp.net method.li ol  pWhich one of these is better and why, and is there another, better way to do thisp  pThanks...p

Negative 688 pI am setting the widgets inside a QListWidget to my own ProductItemWidget class to be able to have more customization over the items in the list. This works fine, but I am unable to get the list to sort automatically. I call p  precodemylist.setSortingEnabledTrue codepre  pand then I try to overwrite the lt comparator of the ProductListItem, which I created specifically to be able to overwrite this function. In the comparator, I try to access the widget corresponding to the two items that are compared and call their getText functions. The issue here is, the  lt  function by default casts the second argument to QListWidgetItem, so in my code I get ProductListItem for self, but I get QListWidgetItem for otherItem. The otherItem does not let me access the ProductItemWidget that it corresponds to because the only way to access it is by passing in the ProductListItem to the QListWidgets itemWidget call. Here is my codep  precodeclass ProductListItemQListWidgetItem     def initself, parentNone         superProductListItem, self.initparent      def ltself, otherItem          thisitemwidget  self.listWidget.itemWidgetself         otheritemwidget  otherItem.listWidget.itemWidgetotherItem          return thisitemwidget.getText lt otheritemwidget.getText  class ProductItemWidgetQWidget     def initself, productname, parentNone         superProductItemWidget, self.initparent         self.label  QLabelproductname         ... setup code ...      def getTextself         return self.label.text codepre  pIs there any way to prevent the call to  lt  from casting the otherItem to QListWidgetItemp  pIve been stuck on this problem for a while so any tips are appreciated.

However, if I try to delete records which have NULL in their any column, then it does not work.p  pThe generated SQL Query is always of the formp  precodeDelete from Employee where Name AND Dept AND Address codepre  pwhich of course cannot handle NULL comparison  SQL requires codeIS NULLcode for checking NULL and codenullcode doesnt do the trick here. So when I pass dept as null in Java code, the generated SQL would be of the formp  precodeDelete from Employee where NameE01 AND Deptnull AND AddressADR01 codepre  pThis does not delete the records from DB which have NULL values in Dept column, as the correct condition would be codeDept IS NULLcode and codeDeptnullcode does not work Is there anyway to compare NULL values in where clause without using a native queryp  pNOTEp  ol liI do not want to use deleteAllCollection method of HibernateTemplate, as it requires fetching the records first and then deleting them  i.e. more than 1 SQL query.

Negative 688 pI have codedlopencodeed a library, and I want to invert back from the handle it passes to me to the full pathname of shared library.  On Linux and friends, I know that I can use codedlinfocode to get the linkmap and iterate through those structures, but I cant seem to find an analogue on OSX.  The closest thing I can do is to eitherp  ul lipUse codedyldimagecountcode and codedyldgetimagenamecode, iterate over all the currently opened libraries and hope I can guess which one corresponds to my handlepli lipSomehow find a symbol that lives inside of the handle I have, and pass that to codedladdrcode.pli ul  pIf I have apriori knowledge as to a symbol name inside of the library I just opened, I can codedlsymcode that and then use codedladdrcode.  That works fine.  But in the general case where I have no idea what is inside this shared library, I would need to be able to enumerate symbols to do that, which I dont know how to do either.p  pSo any tips on how to lookup the pathname of a library from its codedlopencode handle would be very much appreciated.

Negative 688 pI am working on an application wherein I have to connect to different database depending upon an customer id that is passed from the client side. The schema for all the databases is same. It is a kind of multitenant application. Since I dont know how many customers will be there, I cannot use xml configuration to statically create the datasources, hence I have to create datasources manually.p  pWe are using Spring JdbcTemplate for connecting to the databases and the connection parameter comes from another database which holds the configuration for the application. I am able to connect to the databases properly, but the method calls are not happening in a transaction. Following is the code snippet which does the database connectivity for only one database and  I was going to extend it for multiple databasesp  precodeBasicDataSource datasource  new BasicDataSource  set database connection params ....  create jdbcTemplate,  jdbcTemplate  new JdbcTemplatedatasource  create transaction managers PlatformTransactionManager txManager  new DataSourceTransactionManagerdatasource codepre  pMy idea is to create the transaction manager manually and somehow bind it in the spring container so that all the methodsclasses with Transactional annotation can use this transaction manager. I am not able to figure how do I bind the txManager, so that all the methodsclasses with Transactional will use this transaction manager. I am not sure whether this is the right way and should I be creating a transaction manager for every datasource, since, I dont want the transaction to span multiple databases, but I want that every service method call should be in a transaction. Note All my service classes have Component and Transactional annotation.p  pAm I solving the problem in the correct wayp

Negative 688 pI am confused about using MVVM in ASP.NET MVC.p  pViews in ASP.NET MVC can only take in one Model class. I have a view and controller that needs to operate on data from more than one model class, so I created a ViewModel class that contains instances of these model classes.p  pI could populate the ViewModel in the Controller, but I have heard people say that you should keep your controllers thin. So I have created a service class to populate the viewmodel. This service class is then injected into the controller.p  p1 Is this the right way of going about things doing MVVM in MVC Can people point me to some resources about this Or have I got the wrong end of the stick about MVVMp  p2 Does presentation logic go in the ViewModel For instance, in the View I could use Razor to do something like if Model.Order.Count  10   show an unordered list. Or do I create a boolean field in the ViewModel called something like ShowUnorderedList and populate this value in the servicep  p3 If I do that kind of presentation logic in the view, how do I unit test the logic in the viewp

Negative 688 pDoes altering an instance method for a model in an app in Django 1.5 require a migration via Southp  pMy understanding is that you cannot serialize random Python code... Moreover, I understand that migrations are really meant to manage changes to table schemalike the addition of an attribute or field for records in the table...or to manage changes to the type of data itself like upgrading plaintext passwords to hashed  salted passwords.p  pSoIF there is NO change made directly to a models attributes, andor no changes to a specific field type or whateverTHEN a migration is NOT necessary, correct p  pAndin generalis it safe to assume changes to instance methods andor even static methods in a Django model do NOT require a migrationp  pPresently, I think it does not.

Negative 688 pI am currently working on legacy code, and Im trying to find a way to recreate the server environment for this old site. p  pThe site is written in PHP4, so I am having trouble working with it on my local machine, because I have PHP 5.5 installed for new development. The biggest problem is that the PHP5 clone function wasnt existent in 4, so the programmers wrote a function for it, however since Object are passed by reference in 5, the clone function is breaking all over the website. p  pWe are also pushing this code back up to the same server with the same specs and I dont feel comfortable migrating the code to PHP5, especially since we are under time constraints. p  pI have looked into using Vagrant to set up an install with PHP 4 on it, but I cant find a way to get PHP4 and mysql4 onto the virtual server.

Negative 688 pWere trying to use SoX to convert our WAVs to CAFs for an iPhone project.  At the moment, as the possesser of the only Mac in the office, its me who has to regularly run afconvert to do this, but Id prefer the guys actually making the audio could do it on Windows instead.p  pI compiled SoX from source to enable CAF support, gave it and a batch file to the sound guys, and all seemed well.  But we started getting distorted sound and I found the cause to be that the endianness of the data in the CAFs produced by SoX was opposite to that produced by afconvert.p  pSo, I added endian swap to the command line in the batch file and thought no more about it.  But the problem persisted, so I traced through a SoX convert and found that it complete ignores the endian flags when writing CAF files or indeed any file type that SoX uses libsndfile for.  If writing to a WAV, SoX does the swap on write, but for CAFs for which it uses libsndfile, nothing.p  pafconvert will swap the endianness, the problem is that SoX does nto pass any endian information down to libsndfile.  The relevant flags are reversebytes whatever the format, reverse the bytes of the data given and oppositeendian whatever the destination format, reverse the endianness.  Neither of these are refered to when setting up libsndfiles SFINFO, which can be told the endianness to use via the format member of SFINFO, but the required information to deduce which to use the endianness of the source data andor the default endianness of the dest file doesnt seem to be available.p  pCan anyone suggest a way for me to get this informationp

Now I want to create a class of filter, say the pagenumber , the pagesize also all the search criteria, so I created a class. I have created a MVC application which is communicating with the web api, the web api returns Json data, then I deserialize it to model. I am stuck with the complex object part, also as of now I am using a list to get the data, later that will be replaced by data base.

Negative 688 pIm reading through the Swift documentation, and hung up on a what I see as an inconsistency in the docs.p  h3Quote 1  Control Flow Sectionh3  blockquote   pIn an strongifstrong statement, the conditional must be a Boolean expressionthis means that code such as strongif score  ... strong is an error, not an implicit comparison to zero.p blockquote  pSo a strict Boolean, would be either TRUE or FALSE.p  h3Quote 2  Control Flow Sectionh3  blockquote   pYou can use strongifstrong and strongletstrong together to work with values that might be missing. These values are represented as optionals. An optional value either contains a value or contains strongnilstrong to indicate that the value is missing. Write a question mark  after the type of a value to mark the value as optionalp blockquote  precodevar optionalName String  John Appleseed var greeting  Hello if let name  optionalName      greeting  Hello, name  codepre  blockquote   pif the optional value is strongnilstrong, the conditional is strongfalsestrongp blockquote  pSo by Boolean they seem to mean truthyfalsy, as strongnilstrong implicitly means strongfalsestrongp  blockquote   pand the code in braces is skipped. Otherwise, the optional value is unwrapped and assigned to the constant after strongletstrong, which makes the unwrapped value available inside the block of code.p blockquote  pSo here is where I see an inconsistency. In the code sample above, since optionalName has a value, the codenamecode variable is assigned John Appleseed.p  pSo in the comparison, we end up with a strongNONBOOLEAN EXPRESSIONstrong specifically, John Appleseed. This is truthy, but NOT boolean, which contradicts point 1p  pIn other wordsin codeafter the value is assigned in the let, we havep  precodeif John Appleseed      greeting  Hello, name  codepre  pBased on strongQuote 1strong, this should throw an error, because it is not a Boolean expression.p

Negative 688 pemHomeworkemp  pI need to use a data structure  algorithm that returns the number of elements within a range consisting of 2 x,y values i.e. return the number of elements that fall within a rectangular range on an xy plane in Olognlogn.p  hr  pI am considering two possiblities, kdtree and a range tree. A kdtree is well suited for this because it can find elements within the range in Ologn  k for k elements it needs to report. But I dont need to report the elements, I simply need to compute the number of elements that are within the range.p  pA range tree could work in that, I could have a property in each node that holds how many are less than itself. This way, I can determine how many elements are less than a particular value in Ologn times by going to the two boundaries and finding the difference in the number of nodes that are less than each other. However, I dont think this will work for data sets that have both an x,y dimension.p  hr  pAm I on the right trackp

This makes sense to me because this is above the server root and shouldnt be publicly accessible.p  pI am aware that this is because I am looking for a file above the server root but I thought that was supposed to be the magic of MVC that I can set the root to the public folder and have a lot more security and clear programming.

In exchange, I receive a JWT token but I dont have any information about the user since only the server has the secret key that is able to decode the JWT token.

I want my friends to be able to register, log in and add some information. I know how to make a php login form, how to secure my passwords in my mysql database, I learned about safe use of sessions, ...p  pThe only problem I have left is the connection between client and server. Im not going to ask my friends credit card numbers or much other personal information except for a username, password, email and maybe telephone number. To keep their information secure, Im told that SSL is the way to go.p  pSo SSL Is this really necessary Any good tutorials on setting up SSL on apache btw my internet provider prohibits me to use a port below 1023, maybe thats important Where should I get a SLL certificate Can it be a free onep  pAnother question do I need a domain name to set up SSL I was planning on giving my friends my global ip so that they can access immediately by entering that ip.p  pOnce again, Im not planning to make a commercial website, just a website so that me and my friends can easily communicate.p

Negative 688 pIm trying to load some text files into numpy arrays. The .txt files represent pixels of an image where each pixel is given an arbitrary relative coordinate between 10 and 10 for x and 0 and 10 for y. In total, the image is 10x256 pixels. The catch is that each pixel isnt given an RGB values it is given a list of intensities that corresponds to the wavelength vales in the first n separated header. Each coordinate is given as the two first tab separated item and the first entry only has 0 0 because that  The format of the text files is as follows p  pre classlangnone prettyprintoverridecodeLine 1 0 0  625.15360  625.69449  626.23538 ... two coordinates followed by the wavelengths Line 2 10.00000  10.00000   839   841   833   843   838   847 ...

Also, I think it would make much more sense if x and y spanned from 09 and 0255 respectively to represent the image instead of the arbitrary relative coordinates given in the data...p  pProblem I dont know how to load the data into a 3x3 stuck figuring out 2x2 and I cant seem to slice properly... p  pWhat I have so farp  precodeintensityarray2  np.zeros[lenuniquey,lenuniquex], dtype int  for element in np.nditerintensityarray2, opflags[readwrite]     for i in rangelenuniquey         for j in rangelenuniquex             with openos.path.joinpathname,rightfile as rf                 intensityarray2[i,j]  np.genfromtxtrf, skipheader  ijj, delimiter    codepre  pWhere codelenuniquey  10code and codelenuniquex  256code are found in a function above.p

Negative 688 pI am loading an extjs4.2.1 application within a div in JSP page. In my JSP i display various links based on what the user is allowed to do. On click of each link the page refreshes and I set some javascript variables based on serverside logic which are used by the extjs app as input.p  pIn order to get rid of the page refreshes and therefore improve performance I have refactored this page using AngularJSI just learnt Angular so I thought I would try using it. I have used routing. So now I get all the inputs for each of the menu clicks at once on page load. When the user clicks on a link the Angular route sets up the appropriate inputs for the extjs application without refreshing the page or going to the server. The extjs application now is present in an IFrame instead of a div as before so the Angular route basically refreshes the IFrame each time a link is clicked to reload the extjs app.p  pThe results seem good. Pages load faster.p  pMy questions  p  ul liIs this good design li liI know AngularJss real power is in data binding and directives which I do not leverage. Is it an overkill to use AngularJs for this usecase li liIs there a better suited library for this specific purposeli ul  pThanks for your time.p

Negative 688 pI have successfully built my first Eclipse 4 RCP application by extending the PartSashContainer of the demo content to also show a second Part.p  pNow I have tried to move the second part to a separate plugin package and import it as fragment. This works up to the point that the new application neither freezes nor throws any explicit exception. It also divides the space of the window into even parts and shows the main part. Unfortunately the part of the window which is supposed to show the content of the second part from the extracted fragment is completely empty. Default constructors for both parts are called. PostConstruct public void createCompositeComposite parent to be found in both parts however is only called for the main part and not for the second. I have set all parts to be visible and to be rendered without any difference. Due to the lack of errors and otherwise strange behavior Im quite convinced to have set all required IDs in both .e4xmi files.p  pAny ideas where there might be the difference between the incorporated and the extracted approachp  pI uploaded both projects as zip file to a hrefhttpwww.xup.todl,20047267MinimumWorkingExample.zip relnofollowlinkap

Negative 688 pAfter days of searching Google and trying other peoples fixes, I cant seem to get around the problem.p  pI have my site hosted on Bluehost, and a few weeks ago I switched to their VPS service. It has apacheAnd I believe its run on Linux.p  pIm new to this whole apache, server, vps stuff, so bear with me. p  pNow after switching to VPS, at complete random times, for a minute or two, my web site gets redirected to another bluehost customer. I only found out they are another customer because there was a bluehost logo on their site, and their site is still under mid way construction. This seems to happen like every ten minutes, and it always goes to the same persons web site. Further, my URL is still at the top, but it displays their web site. p  pAlso, if I try to go to anther page other than my index.php while this is happening, it says files not found on apache server. So it leads me to believe that the server starts to look in other directories for the files. p  pBluehost doesnt know what is going on. So I need help if any of you canp  pMy site is all PHP and HTML. Uses MYSQL. Uses WHMwebhost manager, and I couldnt find any problems in the WHM settings either... Checked my .htaccess, httpd.conf, index.php and other php files I have when a user hits my home page. Checked a name records, ip addresses, all that stuff.p  pThanks  p  pEdit Another thing I noticed. Sometimes when I load my site and this kind of stuff is happening, it loads half the images, and the other half wont load. So it seems it gets confused at random on where to look for the files. p  pFurther, FTP access gets denied as well Seems the server completely changes itself to another server and locks me out. p

The numbers listed after it such as code,3245697351286309258,[]code and code,6057413202557366578,[]code will also always be in the same format, just different numbers and one of those numbers will always be a specific ID. I then find that specific ID I want, I will always want that number inside codepid3Dcode and code26oidcode.p  precodepid  explodepid3D, VC, 2 pid  explode26oid, pid[1], 2 pid  pid[0] codepre  pIn this case that number is code6057413202557366578code. Next I want to explode VC in a way that lets me put everything after code,6057413202557366578,[]code into a variable as its own string.p  pThis is where things start to break down. What I want to do is the followingp  precodevinfo  explode,.pid.,[],VC,2 vinfo  vinfo[1] Everything after the value I used to explode it. codepre  pNow naturally I did look around and try other things such as pregsplit and pregreplace but Ive got to admit, it is beyond me and as far as I can tell, those dont let you put your own variable in the middle of them e.g. code,.pid.,[]code. p  pIf Im understanding the whole regular expression idea, there might be other problems in that if I look for it without the pid variable e.g. just the surrounding characters, it will pick up the similar parts of the string before it gets to the one I want, e.g. the code,3245697351286309258,[]code.p  pI hope Ive explained this well enough, the main question though is  How can I get the information after that specific part of the string code,.pid.,[]code into a variablep

Negative 688 pIm tutoring a student and one of her assignments is to describe an Onlogn algorithm for the closest pair of points in the onedimensional case. But the restriction is shes not allowed to use a divideandconquer approach. I understand the twodimensional case from a question a user posted some years ago. Ill link it in case someone wants to look at it For 2D case plane  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7762034closestpairofpointsalgorithmClosest pair of points algorithma.p  pHowever, for the 1D case, I can only think of a solution which involves checking each and every point on the line and comparing it to the closest point to the left and right of it. But this solution isnt Onlogn since checking each point will take time proportional to n and the comparisons for each point would take time proportional to 2n. Im not sure where logn would come from without using a divideandconquer approach.p  pFor some reason, I cant come up with a solution. Any help would be appreciated.p

When youll scroll down to the record 100, the dataBound grid event will be triggered and youll be able to notice the dataSource page has changed from 1 to 2.p  pYoull also notice some rows from page 1 are still visible and their index will be calculated as a page 2 element.p  pFor instance, the record 96 has the index 95 as long as the grid remain on page 1.  When youll switch to page 2, the record 96 will be displayed as the first item.  At this point, index returned by the grid for that row will be 0.  If you apply the page number  size rule above, youll end up with the index 100.p  pIs there any solution that doesnt involve a row index calculated on the server sidep  pstrongNotestrong If we had a PK column, it could be possible to use it to build a list of index, but we dont always have a PK column so this isnt an option.p

Negative 688 pWhen I am coding I like to avoid magic functions that have different behaviour based on argument choice, for example, imagine that you can login using either email and password, or using a special token p  precodeloginemailNone, passwordNone, tokenNone codepre  pWhile convenient to have a single login function, it raises many questions such as, what if the caller fills in ALL parametersp  pIt also makes for possibly ugly function calls such as codeloginNone, None, atokencode especially if your language does not support named parameter passing. Sometimes people will try to mitigate this by passing flags or enums to the function to signal what behaviour they want.p  pI usually would prefer having different functionsp  precodedef loginpasswordemail, password def logintokentoken codepre  pAnd therefore leave the responsibility to the caller to choose with no ambiguity what he wants, while also having the interface very clear.p  pI am designing a RESTful API in fact I am also writing a RESTful microservice python framework and I am faced with this same question again  When I want to login the user, on this API we actually create a SESSION, so a login would be equivalent to callingp  precodePOST sessions     body gt email, password    creates a session in uri sessions1234 codepre  pNow I want to support the token, so this leads us top  precodePOST sessions     body gt email, password OR token codepre  pSo, should I have this single url which handles all forms of session creation and give it a complex validator, or should I have multiple endpoints such as sessionsbasic and sessionstoken  This does not look very restful to me, as I was told to POST to the collection if you want to create a resource, but the other option has all the problems i said before and will have a complex, slower validator.

Negative 688 pThough this is my first question on the StackOverflow, I consider myself a long time member of the community.p  pConsidering myself as a preintermediate programmer, Ill try to be as specific as possible.p  pIm writing a Python package that uses a C dll to load image files with ctypes. Im using Python 3.3.5 32bits version on Windows 8 x64. I had to build the dll from the C code. The dll is stbimage.h which is available in a hrefhttpsgithub.comnothingsstbblobmasterstbimage.h relnofollowGitHuba. I used CodeBlocks version 13.12 with the GCC compiler. The dll seems to have built fine.p  pBy my definition, the dll is must be in the same folder as the py code file that wraps its functions, but when ctypes attempts to load the dll an exception is raised the [in]famous WindowsError [Error 126] Module not found.p  pIve found several similar questions and attempted to glean from their solutions byp  ul lipadding the dll path via codeos.environ[PATH]codepli lipadding the dll path manually in the Path environment variablepli lipchanging the current working directory with codeos.chdircodepli lipusing the strongfilestrong module attribute to locate the librarypli ul  pnone of these solved the issuep  pThe stbimage library itself has no dependencies so I dont understand why windows cant find it since the dll is where it should be and the path addresses its exact location. And, of course, theres a lot of other ways to get the job done PyGame, pySFML which also uses stbimage, PIL, PyPng, PySDL, you name it, but Im  doing this mostly for learning purposes.p  pAt the writing of this question, something popped up in my head which may or may not have any relation with the problem whenever I compile and link programs with GCC and try to run them, I got a message box telling me that some dll libgcc.dll or something like that was not found. Could that be the reason Windows cant load stbimage.dllp  pI tried everything my experience allowed me to do to solve it but it was not enough. Would you guys, please, give me a light on thisp  pemPS. Sorry for any bad english. Im natural from Brazil.emp

The app provides an activity which doesnt do anything except showing a layout on the screen, and a widget which does a bit more.p  pFor this I extended codeAppWidgetProvidercode and added codeonReceiveContext, Intentcode to check for various broadcasts APPWIDGETENABLED, APPWIDGETUPDATE, com.google.android.c2dm.intent.RECEIVE, and two selfdefined broadcasts for an alarm that broadcasts with midnight and for when the user taps on the widget.p  pAny time this codeonReceivecode method is called no matter with what intent I get this in the logcat I removed the timestamps and PID for readabilityp  precodeEResourceType 0x5ad905b8 Failed to ResTableremove cookie  0x3, not last table. mHeaders.size  4. Warning for spontaneous crashes when the garbage collector runs. Easset Error removing runtime skin resource cookie 0x3 Iasset Problem removing all runtime skin resources codepre  pThe method is completely executed though, so Im tempted not to worry about this. However, Im not sure if it could cause problems in specific cases or later, if I will add new features to the app.p  pSo strongshould I worry about these errorsstrongp  pIn my app Im using the libraries androidsupportv4 and jodatime. Im also using Googles Cloud Messaging service GCM. p  pThe codeonReceivecode method is nothing special. First of all, it makes sure that the device is registered for GCM. After that, it just checks what broadcast was sent exactly and acts accordingly. If Im not mistaken, there cant be a problem in the latter part since the error occurs with every possible broadcast.p  psubiI found a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq219067381544337Failed to ResTableremovea, but as the question doesnt provide much information and the OP doesnt answer the questions in the comments, I thought it would be OK to open my own question.isubp

The VMS are SL6.4 with 8GB of mem and 8 CPUS. p  pLooking at the jmeter box I can see that I have plenty of free memory, there no out of memory errors, and the java process is using 80 of cpu. The load on the jmeter box is 0.5 with 92 cpu idle, or so. p  pThe question is, do you think this could be a jmeter bottleneck Ive seen to have this sort of results with any tests I do against other URLs.p  pThanks for the help. p  pjoaop

Most of them say, MD5, SHA 1 is a hrefhttpscrackstation.nethashingsecurity.htm relnofollowbrokena which being shipped with .net framework. some say SHA 2 either a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions800685whichcryptographichashfunctionshouldichoose256a, 512 is ok whereas other a hrefhttpcodahale.comhowtosafelystoreapassword relnofollowsay it vulnerable tooa. while PBKDF, bcrypt, scrypt being recommended but they are slow when it comes to performance. Now confused which algorithm to choose considering security, compatibility, etc. Is there any new solutions .net 4.5 provides or shipped with C 6.0p  pIf bcrypt.net is to be used, what need to be set as work factor ie how many iterations recommended minimump

Since 9 is 8s manager then 8 has no authority to change 9s line manager. I hope that is clear enough.p  pHope you guys can help.p  pThanks. DSp

Negative 688 pI am creating a custom draggable directive in AngularJS. Its a combination of jQuery events and vanilla javascript.

Negative 688 pIm currently doing an unpaid, part time internship at a public school district.  Ive been assigned a project to build a webpage that cleans up the desktop for elementary school images Installs of OS Windows 7 with custom default applications and settings in the district.  The current images have numerous shortcuts to websites that the students use because these students dont know how to use browsers yet.p  pInstead of having a separate shortcut for each website, all images in the district will receive a new shortcut to the website I am building.  It organizes hyperlink images by school. All, Elementary, Middle, High This reduces desktop clutter by using one shortcut to bring up clear and easy to use links for anyone in the district.  It also includes staff links, such as for Email login, Helpdesk Requests, etc.p  pBackground I work mostly with Java, but I have experience with .NET Forms Programming.  I have never built a webhosted application before and am trying to learn to use Silverlight because this district is an all Microsoft district and Java gives the IT department too many issues.p  pI could add the images by hand on the page designer or through xaml, but then we run into a problem Im the only one in the district with significant more than a 3 hour intro course programming experience.  For the page to maintain functionality after I leave this May, I am creating a sister application that allows users to easily edit markup files that store information about each set of links.  This means that the primary web application needs to read these files and create the links itself.  The problem Ive encountered is in making images appear on the layout root.p  pInstead of adding them directly to the root, I created a codeCanvascode in xaml that will host all the images and links.  This codeCanvascode is named Root to aid in confusion.  The code I am using to attempt to add a test image is below.p  precode        Image imagy  new Image                      Width  Height  200,             Name  imagy,             Source  new BitmapImagenew UriCLinks WorkspaceGC Web LinksDistrict LinksDistrict LinkssrcImagestest.png,                   Root.Children.Addimagy         Canvas.SetLeftimagy, 100.0         Canvas.SetTopimagy, 100.0 codepre  pThe path is correct, however when built and loaded, the image is not present.  The code is being executed without throwing any exceptions.  Ive also tried initializing the image object and setting the properties afterwards, and tried to add it without changing any property but the source and I still dont see the image.  Is it initializing invisible, is it adding in an offscreen location, is it loading behind the layout root  At this point Im not sure what the issue could be which is why I am here.  I cannot see a difference between the code I am using and the code most people have submitted as solutions to other problems concerning this on WPF applications.p

Negative 688 pIm new to the site as a poster, but have used it for quite a while as I research new methods for my projects. I just cant seem to find the information I need for my current project, most likely because Im not working my searches right. Im hoping you guys can point me in a direction where I can get my answer.p  pProblem I work for a company with user all around the globe and have to keep in mind that our global users cannot see all available data. With that in mind, I do have a system where some scheduled tasks are setup that some of our global users had setup and then the system was restricted to US only users. Once this restriction was placed on the system, these scheduled tasks are not accessible to the users and unfortunately that must remain on this system.p  pTo address this, I have been tasked with setting up an internal web app that is accessible by our global users that will display the scheduled task information and allow the users to run any of the tasks manually if there is a need for it. Keep in mind, when the user runs the task, the command will need to come from the server hosting the site as it will be using a user account Domain account that has admin access to the server and can run the task as the global users have no access to this system.p  pI currently have most of this accomplished. I have a nice PHP page goes through an array filled with the Scheduled Tasks names, runs the SCHTASKS.EXE command with necessary arguements and switches on the server and retrieves the information for each Task. It then sorts the data and displays the needed data in a table format for the user to view. I also have a basic button being created for each task on each row of the table.p  pHere is the issue that I am running in. How do I configure this button, and PHP page, to tell the server to run the SCHTASKS.exe RUN command again, from the server and not the users system to get the task to runp  pIs this possible I have worked on this for the last few hours just to hit a dead endp  pI am fairly new to PHP, so I have been learning as I go. p  pSorry for the long winded explanation, I just wanted to make clear what Im trying to do here. I hope I didnt over explain anything.p  pHeres the code I have so far.

Ive started from the VB script a hrefhttpblog.sqlauthority.com20150110sqlserverwhatisthequeryusedinspcursorfetchandfetchapicursor relnofollowhere on SQL Authoritya to recreate the open cursor, but I cannot for the life of me figure out how to make it blocking.p  pIve seen many methods for recreating blocking transactions open a transaction in one window, but do not commitclose, then try an update on same table in another, but not that would utilize FETCH APICURSOR in a way that would allow us to successfully test. Im somewhat at a loss here. p  pHas anyone had success in simulating blocking cursors in the past and can offer suggestionsp

Negative 688 pIm starting to build a really small API and I need to authenticate some endpoints, not all of them. I want to be able to select which endpoint to force authentication with an codeauthenticatecode method to be called in the body of the route.p  pFor examplep  precoderesource groups do     desc List all groups.     get do       authenticate        groups list of groups v1     end end codepre  pI have this working. I used a helper where I manually get the base64 encoded data from the header using coderequest.env[HTTPAUTHORIZATION]code. I decode that data and check against the database if the user and secret belongs to a registered user. This is working fine, but I want to use Grapes helper to avoid all the base64 decoding etc etcp  precodehttpbasic do username, password end codepre  pMy idea is inside that method always return true, assign username and password to username and password and have a helper that grabs those variables and check against the db. All that works fine, the problem is that for routes that doesnt require authentication as the Authorization header is empty the popup asking for password appears, and I want to avoid that. Is there a way to use the helper to do what I want to dop  pBTW Im using grape mounted on railsapip  pThanksp

I would like that when a layer overlap another only one of this can be visible in the overlapping region. Each of this layer has an opacity less than 1, so is not enough to set the ordering of the layer on the map. Im wondering if it is possible to give a priority to layer, so when they overlap just one of them is visible. Another possibility is to make one layer an hole of another layer, it is possiblep
Negative 688 pHello I need 2 div one inside another. The HTML code is belowp  precodeltdiv stylewidth 500px height 500px border 1px solid red position relativegt ltdivgt Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industrys standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.  It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a moreorless normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using Content here, content here, making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for lorem ipsum will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose injected humour and the like.   Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at HampdenSydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum The Extremes of Good and Evil by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.., comes from a line in section 1.10.32.    ltdivgt      ltdiv styleposition absolute right 0 top 0 width 200px height 100px border 1px solid greengt     ltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pwith the above code, Im getting below outputp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comAaDIQ.png altenter image description herep  pThe content is going inside of inner div.p  pstrongHow will I resolve thisstrongp  pIm an novice in HTML.

Negative 688 pstrongSOLUTIONstrongp  pInstead of using codesetInitialRangecode I had to set the initial xvalues using codesetXAxisMincode as well as codesetXAxisMaxcode. A little bit confusing, I think.p  pstrongORIGINAL QUESTIONstrongp  pIm currently working on a project involving the acharteninge library for drawing time diagrams which works excellent so far. The user is capable of switching between various graphs one XYMultipleSeriesDataset plus one TimeSeries per graph via separate buttons. So far, achartengine displays all x values when the graph is shown.p  pHowever, I was asked to display only the data captured in the first three hours when the graph is shown, as this information is most relevant. Nevertheless, the user should still be able to scroll to data captured after the first three hours meaning that limiting the xaxis maximum value is not an option.p  pFor example There are two curves. The first curve is drawn using data captured over a period of 4 hours, while the second curve is created out of data captured over 18 hours.p  pIn the current version my programme initially displays all data of the graph which gets displayed meaning the first curve shows three hours of very relevant data while 1 hour of not so important information is shown too. The ratio of the second curve is 3 to 15 highly significant data vs regular data. As a result, a different amount of high important information is shown when the user compares the two curves making it harder for the user to compare this data, as he has to adjust the zoom manually.p  pstrongEDIT 01.04.2015 1546strongp  pFor setting the initial range I use the XYMultipleSeriesRenderer instances method codesetInitialRangedouble[] initialRangecode which does not affect the graph at all.

Negative 688 pI recently configured this plugin on my project. The assets in my S3 bucket are uploaded with some random hash code appended to them.

Negative 688 pI know it is possible to specify codeincludecode filepaths either relative to the directory the file is located in, as an absolute file path, or relative to any of the directories in the codePATHcode system variable. Is there a way to instead specify it relative to the users current directory when the program is compiled Lets say I have the following file structurep  precodedira   a.c   a.h dirb   b.c   b.h makefile codepre  pNow lets say I want to codeincludecode the file codediraa.hcode from codedirbb.hcode. Using the location of codedirbb.hcode, this can be written like thisp  precodeinclude ..diraa.h codepre  pHowever, this approach has a major flaw in my opinion since it hardcodes the locations of files relative to each other, meaning that relocating a file would require updating the file path everywhere that file was included from.p  pUsing absolute file paths would avoid this problem, but would instead hardcode the location of the project within the filesystem, which seems like bad practice.p  pFinally, using the codeltgtcode tags to specify the file path isnt feasible either since I cant assume the project will be listed in the codePATHcode variable.p  pSo what I want to do is to be able to specify the paths relative to where the user compiles from or even better, from the location of the makefile. In the above example, this would let me use the following statement to codeincludecode codediraa.hcode from codedirbb.hcodep  precodeinclude diraa.h codepre  pThis I think would be the ideal solution. It would make the codeincludecode statements more consistent and easier to follow, as well as avoid the drawbacks I listed above. Is it possible to do this in any way, eg. with a compiler flag or something Im using codegcccode as my compiler.p

Negative 688 pI am currently in the process of developing a Java game which is similiar to checkers. p  pThere are two players, codeplayer Xcode and codeplayer Ycode. I do not want a GUI for this game, just an output below. In the game, player codeXcode starts at code[0,0]code and player codeYcode starts at code[7,7]code. p  pMy first problem is I am not sure how to enter i.e code[3,6]code, to get player codeXcode to move to code[3,6]code. p  pWhen player codeXcode moves from code[0,0]code, then code[0,0]code should be marked as unavailable, therefore, neither player can either go to that space or jump over it and this is my second problem as I am not sure how this can be done. p  pThe aim of the game is really to get one of the players in a position of not being able to move anywhere. We are meant to add different AIs into it but if I get the basis working I can try develop the AIs.p  pI am not the strongest programmer therefore if my code can be edited in anyway to make things easier, any help would be appreciated.

I want to synchronize all connected clients with the current data on a MySQL DB. I came up to use webservices as for coordination purposes, but I got stuck.p  pThe way I tried to implement it is...p  pThe webservice is running a deamon to checklisten on CRUD operations affecting DB data. Once an CRUD operation has been occured it undetakes to notify all the connected clients and each client in turn refreshes the JTable with current DB data and informs the user with the change that took place on the DB.p  pThis is where Im stuck...p  pThe way Im thinking its maybe wrong, since conceptually webservices are awaiting for client requests and then send him the corresponding response. But here, there is no client requests. The webservice just sends a response noification, which must multicast since its unaware of a calling client theres no request.p  pTherefore, in order a client to send a request it must cron all the time the webservice if a change on the DB has been occured. Then the webservice responts as true or false with the CRUD details CRUDEventFiredeventtype, eventdetails. But, this is not optimal as it will create big and much of time useless traffic especially when there is no CRUD operation occured. Also, there will be two different deamons one in webservice and the other in clientapp that checklisten for the same type of event and thats redundant.p  pAlso, with that implementation it seems that theres no need for a webservice at all and the code to check the DB for changes could be implemented in the client. On the other hand setting the client responsible for the DB changes would require to code the same functions in different platforms desktop, ios, android, etc, while setting the webservice as the coordinator for data synchronization between clients would require to code only once the appropriate function and each client simply implement its own NotificationListener.p  pIs it wrong the way Im thinking using webservices How it should be changed Do I even need to use webservicesp  pI attach my diagram for your convinience.p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comBioL2.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comBioL2.png altdiagramap

Negative 688 pI have a situation where I used STUN to establish a UDP [RTP] connection between two clients so that they can stream media with one another with some packet loss. Now, they are done streaming media and one client would like to send the other client a large file. Rather than using UDP [RTP] to send the large file, I would find it more convenient, as a programmer, to send the file with TCP because TCP takes care of resending lost packets on my behalf. Can I just tell the client applications to stop using their UDP connections say with socket.close socket  null and immediately open up new TCP connections at the same portaddress as the UDP connections Will that work or will the threeway handshake get blocked Is there a timing or security issue involved In which cases will replacing hole punched UDP with TCP work and in which cases will it not workp

Negative 688 pSo Im trying to make a simple clock in JavaScript and HTML. The clock is just a button that displays the time immediately after the page loads.

Negative 688 pI have implemented a CQS approach in my application heavily influenced by this fantastic article a hrefhttpscuttingedge.itblogsstevenpivotentry.phpid9 relnofollowhttpscuttingedge.itblogsstevenpivotentry.phpid9a.

The downside is this will allow multiple values for the arguments to be accepted too so youd need to add a check for it if appropriate.p  pAlternatively you can also set a default value for the argument see answer from chepner and Anand S Kumar.p

Negative 688 pI have a legacy code to maintain where I have a UIView and inside that container I have an MKMapView. There are custom annotations on this mapView.

Negative 688 pThis is a follow up to a question found a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions31747896searchingcolumnforconsecutivevaluesandreturningthreedifferentvaluesto31749320noredirect1comment5210444631749320herea.p  pThe solution provided by Grade Eh Bacon assumed that each decimal code corresponded to a specific status, however that is not the case. The decimal code must first be converted to binary and each bit corresponds to a specific description. So, for example, 0000000000000001 would correspond to just one status Idle Cutout Active, and 0000000001000001 would correspond to two statuses High Coolant Temperature emandem Idle Cutout Active.p  pIve devised a way to split the 16bit string into each bit and populate a series of columns such that my data looks like thisp  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comTZ3A6.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comTZ3A6.png altenter image description hereap  pstrongNotestrong The data continues well beyond the row that can be seen in the image above it goes until Row 8651.   p  pIs there a way that this solution could be modified to count the 1s columns D through S rather than look at the decimal code in Column B. I imagine this would result in a great number of columns being used, so perhaps theres a more optimal way to do what Im trying to get done. To reiterate, what I want to do is find the Start and End time of five or more consecutive 1s with timestamps that are within 2 minutes of eachtoher, and have the corresponding descriptor appear with that Start and End time stamp so that I can achieve a more readable format for the data that appears above.

Negative 688 pI have a website which has many pages that are not exactly the same, but one thing they have in common is that on each page there are some tabs, and if you click TAB A, certain information shows up, then if you click TAB B, other information, etc.p  pI know that it is very easy to use Angular to do this, and I wish to use it, however I do not wish to convert the entire site to a full Angular application. I simply want to include the Angular javascript file on every page of the site, and only use the nghide and ngshow functionality for these tab items.p  pSo my question is Will it affect a users experience much if every page he goes to on my site has to launch Angular again I am not worried much about the network times of downloading Angular.js because I am sure I can configure caching so that the actual script doesnt have to reload, but what I am considering is the CPUmemory aspect and whether it will result in an extra period of time for every page to load  this is already an issue on this site, so adding an extra 0.5 seconds lets say would be undesirable.p

Negative 688 pApologies as I am not a programmer, but have developed my front end Wordpress skills on top of a base theme. I am looking for some help with the final piece of a puzzle for my Woocommerce site. I have built a wholesale back end for my current distributors and it is still in test phase due to this problem. I wanted to create a Minimum Order Quantity per product not for the basket total so that the checkout can only be actioned if the MOQ for each available wholesale product equals 12. The extra issue was that my products clothing have variations, so the MOQ only needed to include 12 pieces of the same product, not 12 per individual variation.p  pI tried various plugins and tests that cater for the minimum order quantity, but none that met my needs of a MOQ per product inclusive of it variations and that would then identify the number per product in the basket and disallow checkout of that particular product if the 12 pieces minimum wasnt met.p  pI found this fantastic bit of a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions28037139woocommerceminimumquantityforoverallproductcategorynotvariationscodea from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comusers2778929rohilphpbeginnerRohilPHPBeginnera which pretty much answers my initial question of how to begin setting up MOQ limitations across variations. I implemented the revised code at the bottom of the thread and made the necessary adjustments to categories. Everything works great with the exception of one part. If I fill the basket with 11 pieces of different variations then it denies the checkout process and presents an error message. If I up this to 12 pieces of same product it allows checkout. This is great However, if I have 11 of one product with error msg then add a single different product entirely, it recognises 12 pieces total and allows checkout... But I need it to disallow the checkout for this instance too unless all products meet the MOQ.p  pIt needs to be this way as my business has MOQ to action any manufacture of any product with my manufacturers. So currently from a wholesalers perspective, 11 pieces of one product and 1 of another means they could checkout and buy, but the reality is that they could not get made.p  pI hope this makes sense and can anyone shed any light on how to modify the code slightly to enable this Many thanksp
Negative 688 pThis is my first post here, the previous search results from other problems have been very helpful but this one I havent been able to find a response so Im going to try to see if someone as an answer or a link to where I can solve it.p  pSo I have a web app website that is getting data by LINQ to SQL and when I want to sort it Im having problems with Cannot access a disposed object error.  So Im using trying to a ViewState to store the GridView.DataSource and when I attempt to set it to a DataTable variable this variable stays null. It goes over the if clause and when it returns from that method it gives the Cannot access a disposed object error. Probably what is happening is the GridGiew as been dropped disposed and I cant access it know but I cant find the solution.

Although I have declared my buttons addButton, subtractButton, etc. within the MainActivity.java file and have assigned them to their respective buttons within the XML file, Im still receiving an error when I run my app. I believe this is because, within the OnClick method, the IDs for the view elements within the XML file are being recognized.

Negative 688 pI developed a MEAN app and got ready to host it. As a production hosting environment I chose Digital Ocean. For deployment I did the belowp  precode1. Started up a droplet with Ubuntu  2. Got readytouse MEAN image on it. 3. copied my application from local machine onto this droplet using flightplan So far so good.. everything works fine. codepre  pHowever, I need to serve the application using https, hence I need a digital certificate.p  pOn searching around, I read threads which said, install NGinx and then install  the digital certificate. There are a bunch of threads which i am finding it difficult to follow. This is mainly because I have very cursory understanding of this new stack.p  pAt this point I am wondering, my express http server is already serving static files.p  pNow what will be the role of nginx in this whole equation how do i route traffic from nginx to express application or vice versa. Do I really need to do this  Is there no way to install a digital certificate with node  p  pAt the end of the day, I need to serve traffic over https.p  pI would like to achieve this without much complication in my stack.p  pAny advice p
Negative 688 pI have problems when you configure authentication in proojektu . using JDeveloper 12.1.3 on Fedora 22 64bit and appears to me forth the following error.p  pError 401Unauthorized From RFC 2068 Hypertext Transfer Protocol  HTTP1.1 10.4.2 401 Unauthorizedp  pThe request requires user authentication. The response MUST include a WWWAuthenticate header field section 14.46 containing a challenge applicable to the requested resource. The client MAY repeat the request with a suitable Authorization header field section 14.8. If the request already included Authorization credentials, then the 401 response indicates that authorization has been refused for those credentials. If the 401 response contains the same challenge as the prior response, and the user agent has already attempted authentication at least once, then the user SHOULD be presented the entity that was given in the response, since that entity MAY include relevant diagnostic information. HTTP access authentication is explained in section 11.p

Negative 688 pI was wondering if anyone has code for a BUGSJAGS model for a repeated measures ANOVA Basically, I have a response strongystrong that I want to model against strongTime of daystrong, strongDaystrong, and strongTreatmentstrong. I would also like to include two interaction terms, strongTreatment x Time of Daystrong and strongTreatment x Daystrong. There are about 20 individuals in the study, who were measured 4 times per day over about 1 week. Im not entirely sure where to start, and Im concerned that the Time of day covariate should also be nested within the Day covariate If anyone has code for the likelihood portion of the BUGSJAGS model, it would be greatly appreciated. I can take care of priors. Just cant seem to get off the ground with this one. p
