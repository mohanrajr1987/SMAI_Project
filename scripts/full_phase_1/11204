Positive 11204 pIn my jqGrid, I have a checkbox which is also available for editing, i.e. a user can click on the checkbox and that checkboxs value will be updated in the database. That is working fine. However when I click on the checkbox and if I try clicking on it again, emnothing happensem. The row does not get saved. Theoretically the unchecked value of the checkbox should be saved. But this does not happen. p  pI have tried referring to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma7210627thisa answer of Oleg but it does not help. p  pThe weird problem is if I select another row and then try to unselect the checkbox again, I do see a save request going.  p  pI am guessing this is because I am trying to edit a row which is currently selected.

Positive 11204 pI would like to know if its possible to create a jqgrid with a footer template for adding new rows as in .net grid view. p  pI dont want bulk updates only single row update and single row insert at a time. For updating records I have seen that inline editing is possible with jqgrid, where I only need to know if I can call the ajax method to update the grid on editing every row and clicking the corresponding save button. Please help me with those two queries.p  pOleg What I intend to have is a row which keeps displaying on every page of the jqgrid. This row must contain input fields Text boxes , and must allow insertion of new rows. It should have a save button at the end of row and when I click it the row should be updated and grid must be bound again.p  pRegarding update  we are not showing whole data in a single instance instead we have given custom pagination using which we fetch data as per requirements, since this is a business Intelligence app lot of data manipulation exists and there is huge data too.p  pHeres the image you asked for p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.com1AxWS.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com1AxWS.png altenter image description hereap  pThat row must be visible to enable users enter data even when on other pages say second or third page of the grid. Here, because we are doing custom pagination I can assume that if once it is created I can make sure I can display it. p  pNotice the save button and reset button. reset is a simple functionality, But for save I want to trigger SP whenever it is clicked, and then reload the grid with uploaded data. p  pI have seen that version 4.0 Inline navigation  a hrefhttpwww.trirand.comblogjqgridjqgrid.html relnofollowhttpwww.trirand.comblogjqgridjqgrid.htmla  in row editing section is what I want though not exactly, but I also want to remove search functionality and paging functionality out of the pager as I have my own search functionality and paging functionality. It would be much helpful if you point me out to some C code as I am using it with asp.net. Have no idea of php at all.p  pPlease suggest.p

Positive 11204 pI am using jqgrid4.5.4 and implemented multisorting in it using code below.p  precodemultiSort true codepre  pThe client also wants to see what column they sorted first and so on. Do we have a way to display it in jqgrid If this feature doesnt exist, we request this in future release. Thanksp  pMy suggestion is p  pTo show the list of columnname, sorticon and a close button next to it in the form of strongtagsstrong similar to stack overflow tagsthis would be great.Just plain list is also fine. It can be displayed on topbelow the grid. It should keep updating each time the sort is performed. We can remove sort on particular column by deleting the tag or clicking on column headerdefault behavior. The multisort order should still be preserved. p
Positive 11204 pIm using jqgrid 4.8.2.  If a user clicks on a row, I want to save the previously selected row and display the current row in edit mode.  Ive used the code from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10404303solutionfordesignthisformsinjqgridprevious answersa but cant get this functionality to work.  After some debugging and looking through the source code for jqgrid, it appears saveRow does not fire because the editable attribute for the previous row is immediately set to 0.  There is a clause in the jqgrid source code that looks for this attribute before saving the rowp  precodeeditable  ind.attreditable o.url  o.url  t.p.editurl if editable1 ....saveRow occurs... codepre  pAny suggestion on how to work around thisp  precodevar editingRowId var myEditParam   keys true,      extraparam activityID aID,      oneditfunc function id  editingRowId  id ,      afterrestorefunc function id  editingRowId  undefined ,      aftersavefunc function id  editingRowId  undefined   var myGrid   jQueryspendgrid.jqGrid             url parentGridURL,             mtype POST,             datatype json,             postData       filters myFilters,             gridview       false, added for IE              altRows        true,             emptyrecords   NO PAYMENTS FOUND,             editurl        savePaymentURL,             onSelectRow    function id                                  console.logid  id   editingRowId    editingRowId                                 var this  this                                 if editingRowId  id                                      if editingRowId                                           save or restore currently editing row                                         console.logshould be saving   editingRowId                                         this.jqGridsaveRow, editingRowId, myEditParam                                         console.logdone saving                                                                          this.jqGrideditRow, id, myEditParam                                                              ,             search         true,             sortname       lastSortName,             sortorder      lastSortOrder,             page           lastPage,             pager          jQueryreportpager,             rowNum         lastRowNum,             rowList        [10,20,50,100],             viewrecords    true,             clearSearch    false,             caption        Payments,             sortable       true,             shrinkToFit    false,             excel          true,             autowidth      true,             height         300,             subGrid        true,  set the subGrid property to true to show expand buttons for each row             subGridRowExpanded showChildGrid,  javascript function that will take care of showing the child grid             colModel [                  label Payment ID,                      name PAYMENTID,                      index p.paymentID,                      key true, width 75                  ,... removed for brevity                name  actions,                      label Actions,                     index formAction,                      formatteractions,                     width 75,                     searchfalse,                     formatoptions                          keys true,                         editbutton false,                         delOptions  url savePaymentURL                                                    ]          .inlineNavreportpager,              the buttons to appear on the toolbar of the grid                               savefalse,                 edit false,                  add false,                  cancel false            codepre

Positive 11204 pI would like to know if there is any event that I can use while grouping to add an additional subtotal rowon top of each total for each grouping key.

So for each category I am able to see the total columnsummary. This works perfectly fine when I am fetching only active products. But I have a scenario when I am showing Active and inactive products the I want to additionally add another subtotal summary row where I aggregate only the inactive rows. The total summary row for each group should aggregate active and inactive rows and that is working fine as well. I just need a way to display the subtotals summary row only for inactive rows. This subtotal row should sit just above the total row for each group. I hope this makes sense you to.p

Positive 11204 pSo, I am using jqGrid and due to the nature of this project, I need to build out the colModel dynamically. Meaning, I need to build the model itself dynamically. I am retrieving data fine with my JSON call.  So, I build an array of objects and then assign that array to the colModel property. No errors, but the data doesnt show up.... I am doing something very similar with colNames and it works fine. Does anyone see what I am missing I have worked on this yesterday afternoon and all morning today and cant find any reason it shouldnt work.  As you can see, it am assigning the siteVal array at the top of my code to the colModel property.p  precodevar siteVal  [name InvtId, index InvtId, width   20, editable false, sortable false, align left, hidden true] siteVal.pushname Descr, index Descr, width 320, sortable false, editable false, align left siteId.forEachfunctionsite     curSite  site.substr0,1Val     siteVal.pushname curSite, indexcurSite, width 20, editable false, sortable false, align left, hidden true  siteVal.pushname Qty, index Qty, width 100, editable true, sortable false, align right, hidden true     var colData  [, Description] colData  colData.concatsiteId colData  colData.concatQuantity console.logcolData jQuerylist3.jqGrid     url OrdersInput.phpdogetdelvpriceampstate  State.val  ampcity  City.val  ampFType  FType.val  ampsiteid  Plant.val,     datatype json,     mtype GET,     colNames colData,     colModel  siteVal,     loadonce true,     height 525,     width 605,     rowNum 1000,     key false,     cellEdit true,     cellsubmit clientArray,     gridComplete function          MsgDel2.html       codepre  pIn using console.log to see the array right after I build it, this is what I get.p  precode    nameInvtId,indexInvtId,width20,editablefalse,sortablefalse,alignleft,hiddentrue,  nameDescr,indexDescr,width320,sortablefalse,editablefalse,alignleft,  nameTVal,indexTVal,width20,editablefalse,sortablefalse,alignleft,hiddentrue,  nameMVal,indexMVal,width20,editablefalse,sortablefalse,alignleft,hiddentrue,  namePVal,indexPVal,width20,editablefalse,sortablefalse,alignleft,hiddentrue,  nameDVal,indexDVal,width20,editablefalse,sortablefalse,alignleft,hiddentrue,  nameWVal,indexWVal,width20,editablefalse,sortablefalse,alignleft,hiddentrue,  nameBVal,indexBVal,width20,editablefalse,sortablefalse,alignleft,hiddentrue,  nameQty,indexQty,width100,editabletrue,sortablefalse,alignright,hiddentrue codepre  pThis looks exactly as I think it should look in that it completely mimics the existing code where the colModel is defined statically. The thing is this must be dynamic to account for future growth...p

Positive 11204 pI am trying to use jqGrid with Phalcon framework. I am trying to fetch data from table and show it in jqGrid. I am able to get a lot of it to work but the data present in a php variable doesnt show up in jqGrid. I have tried a lot of options, seen jqGrid samples etc. The samples fetch data from a mysql table so there is a codeurlcode option where a php file used to get this data is specified. In Phalcon I cannot fix the URL as its a volt file which gets converted to a php on the fly and is executed and secondly the data is in a variable. I have used codeecho jsonencoderesponcecode but it actually echoes the data on screen rather than showing it in the grid. coderesponcecode is the variable containing the json data. I am using the codevoltcode templating engine of Phalcon which generates php files. Most of the lines in below code are php and codevoltcode lines are intuitive. The complete javascript and php is in a single file. I could be doing some incorrect things so pardon my lack of knowledge of javascript amp ajax.p  pI am trying to show data in two parts, on top is the master data like in an invoice and jqGrid should show the line items, i.e. detail rows of the master data.p  pHere is the whole code of codeedit.voltcode file from directory codeappviewsltmymodelgtcode in my MVC structured Phalcon setup.

Negative 11204 pIve recently switch to MVP pattern with a Passive View approach.

Negative 11204 pIm designing a programming language, so Ive been putting a lot of thought into the way base types are named.p  pDictionary seems like a bad name for what dictionaries do.  They arent organized lists of words with their definitions they dont deal with words, they dont with definitions, and they arent lists.  The only vague association they have with the word dictionary is that one performs lookups just as one does with a paper dictionary which is as good an argument for calling them phone books.p  pHashTable describes an implementation which may change.p  pAssociative array from JavaScript gets points because associative is a good adjective for what it does, but loses points because array also describes an implementation, and worse, describes it inaccurately.p  pKeyvalue pair set seems most accurate but it too long to be useful do you really want to type KeyValuePairSet every time.p  pIf we call a keyvalue pair an association we get AssociationSet.  That to me is the best but doesnt jump out at me as the right answer yet its still long and set still feels a bit wrong.  AssociationList is worse list implies ordering, which isnt there.  I briefly considered just Associations but that sounds more like something I would name an instance rather than the class.  RelationSet and PairSet are shorter but less descriptive neither captures the fact that its sort of a oneway relationship key to value value to key is not meaningful within the context of dictionaries.p  pAny ideas what a better name for dictionaries might bep
Negative 11204 pFirst off, please forgive the stupidness of this question but Im not from a CC background. Im a little unclear about what the difference in roles between the .h and .m files when it comes to properties. p  pI understand the concept of interfaces, and I see that in part the .h file is an interface for the implementation, but what I am not clear on is thisp  ul liWhy are propertiesmethods defined outside of the  braces li lipWhat am i defining in the braces when I write something like this p  pIBOutlet UITextField numberFieldp  pIs this a field definition in an interfacepli lipWhen I am adding the Property lines to the .h files are these actual implementations of a n auto property or just an interface blueprint If so is the syntesis the actual implementationpli ul  pI guess my biggest confusion seems to be that if I want a property Im defining what I need in three different places 1 in the interfaces braces, 2 as property outside the braces and 3 with synthesis in the .m file. This seems long winded, but its fine if I can work out what these three parts do.p  pCheers, Chris. p

Negative 11204 pI have a custom Sharepoint workflow activity created in Visual Studio that works and logs properly in my test environment but fails in production with a generic Error Occurred message in the Workflow History list.p  pIn order to debug the activity since remote debugging against production is a last resort, I implemented stepbystep logging to the Workflow History List to see at what point it was failing, only to discover that it seems to be reaching an error state before the first logging occurs.  I had been using a trycatch to capture the exception and log it to the list as well.  Still no logging in the history list.p  pAt this phase, logging was done with the following codep  precodeSPWeb spWeb  SPWebContext.Web SPWorkflow.CreateHistoryEventspWeb, this.WorkflowInstanceId, 0, spWeb.CurrentUser, new TimeSpan, Update, message here, string.Empty codepre  pwhere spWeb is the workflow contexts Sharepoint Web.

After starting the codeBlinkTextcode several times i hitted all the time my button2 to get the current state and to force a garbage collection. And as it seems all the timers will be destroyed strongafterstrong calling the codeStopcode method.

Negative 11204 pLets say you are dealing with your normal contact database you know... name, phone number, address, email, etc.... If youre concerened about this locally, its generally not a big issue to deal with, but when we look at international sets it is.p  pstrongLooking at the phone number system,strong you would think its simple, but its really not. In north america, we generally have 12223334444 format for calling people.  This is of course divieded down into your international dialing code, area code, exchange prefix and line number. Problem real phone numbers are limited, there are around 220 area codes in the US out of the potential 1000, each area code only has a limited number of exchanges, and the line numbers are restricted to specific use under that country for example, patterns with 911 are restricted, only about 34ths of the 10,000 are in use. Take this over to the UK, they have their own set of rules for line numbers, such as reserving most of the 03000399 block to specific use, and other restrictions. International codes are also limited. Normalizing area codes, exchanges, and putting  data validation checks onto phone numbers just got complicated. Im not going into detail about when we go into places that are not part of the a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiListofNorthAmericanNumberingPlanareacodesNPA schemea, but lets just identify that we cant really trust the north american template, kick back, and call it a day.p  pHow do we normalize for things like this How do we validate data How do we deal with these seemingly adhoc extension codes or instructions for internal dialingp  pa hrefhttpwww.bitboost.comrefinternationaladdressformats.htmlstrongInternational addressesstronga are not much better, the differences between not just data retained, but also output formats arent the same across the board. How do we deal with international postal codes, when in canada the format is A1A1A1, and the USA has a system such as 55555[4444]p  pIm tempted to just write classes for each of these situations as I encounter them, store them in the database as XMLJSONsimilar, but then how do I relate fields and easily search my content I dont want to end up creating a table moster of thousands of tables for each country. I want an easily scalable solution where I can normalize my addresses and validate the content. Is this too much to askp

Negative 11204 pFrom what I understand, when a COM component marked as using a hrefhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiComponentObjectModelThreading relnofollowSTAa is used from an a hrefhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiComponentObjectModelThreading relnofollowMTAa thread, the calls are supposed to be marshalled to an STA thread and executed from that dedicated thread. In the case of a Windows client application, this would mean that it would execute on the UI thread if marked as STA, and that callbacks from the COM component to me would be handled by Windows messages sent to a hidden window and processed on the Windows message loop.p  pWhat happens though if I use a STA COM component in a WCF service hosted in IIS Will the worker process have a Windows message loop on a STA thread Can I fire up my own STA thread with its own message loopp
Negative 11204 pIm working on shipping in a change for my lab that will hopefully help diagnose some weird channelfaulting weirdness were seeing. Theres a test application that uses DuplexChannelFactory to connect to a couple windows services, and for some reason the channels on this test application seem to be faulting quite a bit. I have plans to implement some retry logic in there, but it would be great to figure out why exactly theyre faulting. p  pI know that channel factories and proxy objects all implement a lot of interfaces, and Ive used reflector to crawl through some of them, but I havent found anything like what Im looking for. Is there a way to query these objects after theyve faulted in order to get some information about what caused the faultp  pEdit The configuration is very basicthe binding is just the defaultconstructed NetTcpBinding, the service implementation has code[ServiceBehaviorInstanceContextMode  InstanceContextMode.Single, ConcurrencyMode  ConcurrencyMode.Reentrant]code, and no special attributes are on any of the operations in the service contract. However, Im asking more about general techniques in diagnosing channel faults, not diagnosing this specific case. I wouldnt expect configuration specifics to have too much impact on that if anything, the configuration details would be something returned by said diagnostics, rightp

Negative 11204 pI have a UINavigationController with two UIViewControllers on it A and B.  From A, I push B onto the stack.  Then the user reorients the device.  I need to move some things around the screen buttons, etc to be visible in the new orientation on A.p  pI find that shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation is getting called on both A and B and returning YES.  But the will  didRotateFromInterfaceOrientation are only getting called on the visible ViewController B.  When B gets popped off the stack, A is shown in the new correct orientation but without the buttons getting moved as needed.p  pTo solve this, I find myself implementing the following patternp  pin header filep  precodeinterface A  UIViewController       ...

It works just fine, but this seems a tedious, and b a lot of duplicated code among my various classes like A.  I can fix b by moving the code to a common superclass, but this still seems like something I shouldnt have to do.p  pIs there a better way of moving my buttons around on views that are not topmost on the navigation stack  My views come from .xibs if theres something in IB I need to check.  Should I just be designing my views such that they dont need to move buttons around when the orientation changesp  pThanksp

I have learned most of the basics but Ive been having trouble finding a tutorial explaining exactly how to do something with XML. I want to create a very basic app which accesses an XML file at a web address and displays the various items within the file as text within the app. Ive come across several tutorials which all seem to do it in a different way, or arent explaining exactly the thing it is I want to do. I dont want to search the XML file, I dont want to update it, I just want to retrieve its contents. Within the XML file are items and within those are categories like title and description.  I want the app to list all of the items and within each one display its title and description.p  pTo be more specific I know that I bind the contents to textblocks using Binding Title or Binding Description. Im just not sure how to connect to the file using WebClient or whatever the easiest method is.  I have no problem displaying the contents of an offline XML file that is already in my solution explorer.p  pIm sure there is a very simple way to do this, and I really appreciate all of your help.p

Negative 11204 pI wrote a JSON compiler and decompiler in a hrefhttpscripting.comstories20101023amazinglyTheOpmlEditorNowD.html relnofollowOctobera. After running a bunch of a hrefhttpjson.scripting.com relnofollowtestsa against other peoples JSON, I was satisfied that it worked, and moved on.

If theres one item I just include a struct named item. If theres more than one I include a list of structs. The list is named item.

So they say the solution is simple, always make it a list. Simple for them, but... p  pBut this is not so simple on my end. Because Im using a generic JSON serializer, and it would have no way of knowing that item should always be a list. Unless...p  pOne way of dealing with this that I dont like and wont do is to make everything a list.p  pI was just wondering what other JSONproducing environments do in situations like this.p

Negative 11204 pSuppose you have an imaginary type system for an imaginary scripting language which is written in C for example, and each type and object in the scripting language has a corresponding type and object in the underlying implementation language. The base class in this imaginary type system is a class called Object, and all other classes must derive from this class. Now, you have another class called HashTable, which is the basis for all variable storage I might have said that wrong namespaces are implemented via HashTables associating one object with another object, global variables are stored via HashTables, and, to the point of the problem, instance variables are also stored in HashTables.  p  pInstance variables are such that every Object has an HashTable in which to store its instance variables. However, HashTable necessarily derives from Object, therefore each HashTable has an HashTable in which to store its instance variables. And every HashTable for every HashTable has an HashTable, and so on ad infinitum.  p  pMy question is, can this type system be implemented in an objectoriented way in the underlying C code If no precautions are taken, the program will enter an infinite loop and cause a stack overflow on the mere instantiation of an Object, because it will instantiate an HashTable which will call its parent constructor for Object, which will instantiate an HashTable...  p  pAre there any viable workarounds for this design flaw which dont involve breaking the desired OO design each type has its corollary type in the underlying code  p  pPardon the grammar in this post, English is not my first language and I might not have explained something in a comprehensible manner.p

Negative 11204 pIve seen and built many examples of GET and POST requests using REST, but I have had trouble figuring out how to get something based on what I post.p  pTo be specific, I am creating a Android app, and for this Im trying to create a system in which a user can recover his or her account settings and have them written back to the SharedPrefs If you arent familiar with this dont worry.p  pSo yea, Im calling a method which queries a MySQL DB and is supposed to return things such as the users name if their username and password match one in the database.p  precode if issetPOST[username]      username  POST[username]  if issetPOST[password]      password  POST[password]   password  md5password  connect  mysqlconnectlocalhost, root,  mysqlselectdbTagDB  query  mysqlquerySELECT  FROM tagusers WHERE username  username AND password  password while e  mysqlfetchassocquery      output[]  e   if issetoutput      print jsonencodeoutput  mysqlclosecodepre  pAs you can see, Im attempting to recover the row if there is a usernamepassword match. However, I dont really have means to access that print jsonencodeoutput line because Im doing a POST request, not send. I tried accessing the a result string from a response handler in the Java code, but that only returns a mess of html. Ive looked online but havent found anything explaining this... whether thats me not wording what I want clearly or just a lack of info, I dont know. Anyways if anyone could point me in the right direction Id really appreciate it, thanksp

Negative 11204 pIm trying to figure out how to best use MongoDB for a very small and simple use case, but finding the docs somewhat confusing. My document should represent the fact that a user can have many emails. If I follow a hrefhttpwww.mongodb.orgdisplayDOCSSchemaDesignSchemaDesignEmbedvs.Reference relnofollowthe documentationa the most obvious and simple solution is to use embeds. The problem is when I want to validate the email address for uniqueness, which is AFAIK impossible with embeds of course I can use mapreduce, but it seems a very poor choice.p  pI definitely feel like emails dont deserve their own collection, but apparently embedded object doesnt let me do the validation and if it does, I really dont believe its going to be efficient. How would you design the schema in this situation p

Negative 11204 pIve used x86 SIMD instructions SSE1234 in the form of intrinsics quite a lot lately. What I found frustrating is that the SSE ISA has several simple instructions that are available only for floats or only for integers, but in theory should perform equally for both. For example, both float and double vectors have instructions to load higher 64bits of a 128bit vector from an address emmovhpsem, emmovhpdem, but theres no such instruction for integer vectors. p  pstrongMy questionstrongp  pIs there any reasons to expect a performance hit when using floating point instructions on integer vectors, e.g. using emmovhpsem to load data to an integer vector p  pI wrote several tests to check that, but I suppose their results are not credible. Its really hard to write a correct test that explores all corner cases for such things,  especially when the instruction scheduling is most probably involved here.p  pstrongRelated questionstrongp  pOther trivially similar things also have several instructions that do basically the same. For example I can do bitwise OR with emporem, emorpsem or emorpdem. Can anyone explain whats the purpose of these additional instructions I guess this might be related to different scheduling algorithms applied to each instruction.p

Negative 11204 pI have a table with 15 columns  all of type int, nvarchar or datetime.  I want to be able to find rows that match values in 6 of the nvarchar columns and 1 of the datetime columns.  A stored procedure will do the select and return the rows.  My question is how should I create an index so the select will be optimal  One index on 7 columns or 7 separate indexes on each column  Does it matter  Does the order of WHERE clauses in the select matter to the order of indexed columnsp  pstrongeditstrongp  pIt may help to know that the purpose of the select is to find 1 or 0 records.  The 6 columns are needed to define a unique record and the datetime column is used to find that record in the past X days.p  pstrongedit 2strongp  pCurrently, there is no data in the table.  The purpose of the table is to determine whether certain action has been performed for a certain client.  Before each action, I will look for a record in the table with those 7 column values.  If there is no record, I will perform the action and then insert a record.  If there is a record, I will skip to the next action and repeat the process.  p  pGiven that there will be lots of inserts to this table the indexes will be rebuilding frequently.p  pThanksp

Negative 11204 pIm building a locationbased web app that will run primarily on mobile browsers. It will be coded with HTML5, javascript, and PHP. Id like the user to have to be prompted to login as infrequently as practical. Id like them to login via PHP and then stayed logged in for x amount of time.p  pI know how to do this with cookies, but Ive been experimenting with HTML5 localStorage. If I use localStorage, I have to do all the validation with javascript and send it to PHP via Ajax. As Im thinking through how to get this done, I wonder if using localStorage is really worth it. From what I understand, its more secure than cookies because the data is not transmitted with every HTTP request, and it cant be accessed crossdomain. But dont modern browsers, like iOS and Android, prevent crossdomain access to cookiesp  pAm I just making it harder on myself by using localStorage What are the reasons to choose localStorage over cookies in a case like this p

Commonly used heuristics for this problem include counting the number of misplaced tiles and finding the sum of the Manhattan distances between each block and its position in the goal configuration.

Negative 11204 pIm using a UIPanGestureRecognizer to recognize horizontal sliding in a UITableView on a cell to be precise, though it is added to the table itself. However, this gesture recognizer obviously steals the touches from the table. I already got the pangesturerecognizer to recognize horizontal sliding and then snap to that but if the user starts by sliding vertical, it should pass all events from that touch to the tableview.p  pOne thing i have tried was disabling the recognizer, but then it wouldnt scroll untill the next touch event.

However, we are now dealing with some external software from a vendor that calls gethostbyaddr and their installer is designed to fail if the result of strongcodehostname ipaddresscodestrong is 127.0.0.1.  This of course causes it to fail on our systems because the servers hostname is in the loopback line of codeetchostscode.p  pMy question is, if I wrap the installer in a bash or perl script, is there a way to mask or temporarily alter the results of strongcodehostname ipaddresscodestrong without changing the etchosts filep  pClarification They are calling the gethostbyaddr function from within their compiled binary installer.

Negative 11204 pPlease excuse the awkward title Ill try my best to explain my peculiar problem.p  pI have three bits of javascript codep  ul liSome self executing code which calls my personal Ajax function and passes it a callback.li liThe ajax function itself which retrieves the data calls the callback passing it the data.li liThe callback itself which takes in the data and parses it into an array of emnem length.li ul  pWhat should be noted is that the self executing code and the callback function are defined within their own closure. The ajax function is accessed through an imported named closure which I defined as emem.p  pI am fairly new to JavaScript and I am still learning about closures and their scopes. I have reason to believe that this problem is probably related to that.p  pAnyway, my problem relates to trying to access that supposedly populated array. Since I defined the array in a suitable scope or so I believe as the parse function I think I should have no problem pushing items into it.p  pThis is self exectuting  p  precodefunction       Load stock var items  [] var response  .AjaxscriptsLookup.php,GET,parse  function parsea     forSimplified view         var item  new .Item         item.name  domStuff.textContent         item.description  domStuff.textContent         item.price  domStuff.textContent         item.id  domStuff.textContent          items.pushitem            Test the length and verify contents     forvar i0 i lt items.length i         alertitems[i].price       codepre  pThis is my definitions, which includes the Ajax functionp  precodevar   function var s        var ajax  functionurl,method,callback         var a  new XMLHttpRequest         a.openmethod, url, true         a.onreadystatechange  function         ifthis.readyState4                 callbacka                       a.send           s.Ajax  function         return ajax       return s  codepre  hr  pSo what justifies the title is that when I probe the code with firebug, I can see that emitemsem is populated with 3 Objects correctly defined by the parsed data.p  pThe loop then alerts as intended 3 times. p  pHowever, if I remove the break points and have firebug ignore the code then the loop doesnt play out and I can only assume that the array is empty.p  pThe code works also if I emalertitemsem prior to the test loop.p
Negative 11204 pDoes anyone have ideas to securely encode a small amount of data into approximately 8 characters I have a project Flash and Flex AS3 not that it really matters that must be deployed on CDDVDROM no local storage nor network access but with a requirement to allow people to come back where they left off. Therefore there will need to be a code that is humanfriendly to print on deadtree or PDF or write down and to enter back into an input field, as well as being secure to stop cheating between different students.p  pThere are 14 assessment items that can be completed in any order. At the moment I CRC32 their login name and take 16 bits from that result, and combine them with the 14 assessment bits into 30 bits that is then encoded using a form of Base32, giving 6 characters, then adding a check character, then using a character replacement for encryption. Upon return to the program and entering the 7 character progress code, after decryption and extraction, if there is a match in the name hash parts, it is assumed the completion bits are correct.p  pOne problem identified was that only two characters change when completing each item. Is there some algorithm that would completely change the entire string if any one bit changes Or is there a completely better way Id also like to store more data dates, more bits for the hash to reduce collisions, location within the course, etc but dont want to go above 8 or 10 characters.p

Negative 11204 pI have created an android app that calculates the numerical values of word, and gives you a list of other words with the same numerical value. The way I have been doing it, is storring the words and value in a .properties file. Ie.  A line from a .proprties file called myWords will have something like 61you, then I just use a get method to call it,br ie.      String myString  ResourseBundle.getmyWords.get61  would return the string you. Is there a better way to do this My guess is that this is not the proper use of a .properties file, and I was wondering if there was another way to do this correctly. I want to include the file in assets folder of the app, and from my limited understanding of sqlite, you can create a file within android, but you cant just include a file in the assets folder, and then read it. So that said, is there some other type of file that I should use, or was I wrong about sqlite, or is the .properties file being used correctlyp

These IDs come from a table called exposession. Theres a crossreference table called exposessionspeaker that contains only two columns  sessionid and speakerid. Theres another table called speakerid that contains speakerid and peopleid. peopleid links the table to a table called newpeople, which contains firstname and lastname. p  pIn exposessionspeaker, there can be multiple records for a given sessionid  each record corresponds to a single session and a single speaker. So to display ALL speakers for a given session, you end up with multiple records. Thats where the group bygroupconcat idea came in I need to display ALL the speakers for a given session in ALL records for that session. Hence, session 169 record 1 speakers are Steve Bullock, Sheila Bacon, and session 169 record 2 speakers are the same, even though none of the other selected values will be the same for the two session 169 records.p  pClear as mud, rightp

So is there any limitation on the size with the LinkedHashMap as the property file keep on increasing and also the keyvalue pair in properties file.

Negative 11204 pI have a panel xib which is owned by class FooController. FooController also has outlets to the  panels Cancel and Proceed buttons.p  pI later decided to recycle this panel for use by the application delegates termination routine. When I assigned selectors to the buttons, I found that the ProceedSave button and a programmatically added DontSave button could accept as selectors methods that were defined in the application delegate class. But the Cancel button would cause unrecognized selector errors unless its selector was defined in the owner class, FooController.p  pFine, that seemed logical. To be consistent, I set up the ProceedSave and DontSave selectors in the FooController class too. But then emtheyem would generate unrecognized selector errors. p  pSo the Cancel button emrequiresem its selector to be in the FooController class.

Negative 11204 pI have three entities created from a database. The master entity has a navigation property to the detail entity, and the detail entity has a navigation property to the subdetail entity.p  pThe master and detail entity records are being mapped to a codeComboBoxcode and the subdetail entity records are being mapped to a codeDataGridViewcode.

From there, the two other codeBindingSourcecode one for the detail and one for the subdetail take care of the rest.p  pAll of the data binding works. When I select a record from the master codeComboBoxcode, the detail codeComboBoxcode updates. The initial state of the controls when the application loads are all correct.

Negative 11204 pIve been using cccuda for less than a week  and not familiar with all the options available in terms of librariessorry if my question is too wacky or impossible.  Heres my problem, I have a process that takes data and analyzes it then does 1 of 3 things, 1 saves the results, 2 discards the results or 3 breaks the data down and sends it back to be processed.  p  pOften option 3 creates a lot of data and I very quickly exceed the memory available to memy server is 16 gigs so the way I got around that was to setup a queue serverrabbitmq that I would send and receive work fromit swaps the queue once it reaches a certain size of memory. This worked perfectly when I used small servers with faster nics to transfer the data, but lately I have been learning and converting my code from Java to cc and running it on a GPU which has made the queues a big bottleneck.  The bottleneck was obviously the network ioprofiling on cheap systems showed high cpu usage and similar on old gpus but new faster cpusgpus are not getting utilized as much and network IO is steady at 300400mbs.  So I decided to try to eliminate the network totally and run the queue server locally on the server which made it faster but I suspect it could be even more faster if I used a solution that didnt rely on external network serviceseven if I am running them locally. It may not work but I want to experiment.p  pSo my question is, is there anything that I can use like a queue that I can remove entries as I read them but also swaps the queue to disk once it reaches a certain sizebut keeps the inmemory queue always full so I dont have to wait to read from disk  When learning about Cuda, there are many examples of researchers running analysis on huge datasets, any ideas of how they keep data coming in at the fastest rate for the system to processI imagine they arent bound by disknetwork otherwise faster gpus wouldnt really give them magnitudes increase in performance p  pDoes anything like this existp  pp.s. if it helps, so far I have experimented with rabbitmqtoo slow for my situation, apollo mqgood but still network based, reddisreally liked it but cannot exceed physical memory, playing with mmap, and Ive also compressed my data to get better throughput. I know general solutions but Im wondering if theres something native to cc, cuda or a library I can useemideally, I would have a queue in Cuda global memory that swapped to the host memory that swapped to the disk so the GPUs would always be at full speedem but that maybe wishful thinking. If theres anything else you can think of let me know and Id enjoy experimenting with itif it helps, I develop on a Mac and run it on linux.p

Negative 11204 pBefore I start, yes I have asked a a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10940422howtofloatimageinsideofdivsimilar questiona before unfortunately due to new information being added, the markup has completely changed for the worse, and its now impossible for me to figure out.p  pI have some very ugly markup generated by a Drupal view. Because many of the class names can be used in multiple places, in various levels of the hierarchy for example, the first codeviewcontentviewgroupingviewgroupingheadercode needs to float left or at least the contents of it do for the headshot image, but the other viewgroupingheader elements need to display to the right of the image, I cant just address the class names I need to get the full hierarchy. Im having some trouble with that... I know someone is going to come along and say, but you can add classes to fields in Drupal views why not do that Well, you can if youre displaying individual fields, but in this case I need to group by 5 of the 6 fields that are displayed, and when you group by a field you set the field itself to be excluded from the display, which means any custom classes you add to the field are ignored. The only thing you can do stylewise with grouping is apply a single class to all rows, which Ive done but doesnt help in this case.p  precodeltdiv classviewcloneofspeakerlistgt ltdiv classviewcontentgt ltdiv classviewgroupinggt     ltdiv classviewgroupingheadergt         ltdiv idfile741 classfile fileimage fileimagejpeg           contextuallinksregiongt             ltdiv classcontentgt                 ltimg srcjohndoe.jpg width180 height180 alt gt                  lt this img needs to float left gt             ltdivgt         ltdivgt     ltdivgt      ltdiv classviewgroupingcontentgt         ltdiv classviewgroupinggt             ltdiv classviewgroupingheadergt                 lta hrefspeakerjohndoegtJohn Doeltagt                 lt this viewgroupingheader a needs to be styled differently                  than the one the next level down view full profile gt             ltdivgt              ltdiv classviewgroupingcontentgt                 ltdiv classviewgroupinggt                     ltdiv classviewgroupingheadergt                         Freelance consultant                     ltdivgt                     ltdiv classviewgroupingcontentgt                         ltdiv classviewgroupinggt                             ltdiv classviewgroupingheadergt                                 Path to Purchase Institute                             ltdivgt                             ltdiv classviewgroupingcontentgt                                 ltdiv classviewgroupinggt                                     ltdiv classviewgroupingheadergt                                         lta hrefspeakerjohndoegt                                     view full profile    ampgtltagt                                     ltdivgt                                     ltdiv classviewgroupingcontentgt                                         lth3gtSessionslth3gt                                         ltdiv classviewsrow viewsrow1 viewsrowodd viewsrowfirstgt                                                   ltdiv classviewsfield viewsfieldtitle1gt                                                 ltspan classfieldcontentgt                                                     lta hrefsessionkeynoteaddress2gtKeynote Address 2ltagt                                                 ltspangt                                             ltdivgt                                         ltdivgt                                         ltdiv classviewsrow viewsrow2 viewsroweven viewsrowlastgt                                                   ltdiv classviewsfield viewsfieldtitle1gt                                                 ltspan classfieldcontentgt                                                     lta hrefsessionkeynoteaddress1gtKeynote Address 1ltagt                                                 ltspangt                                             ltdivgt                                         ltdivgt                                     ltdivgt                                 ltdivgt                             ltdivgt                         ltdivgt                     ltdivgt                 ltdivgt             ltdivgt         ltdivgt     ltdivgt ltdivgt ltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pThis is what Ive tried, for example, to get the outer viewgrouping  I want to put a border around the entire thingp  precode.viewcloneofspeakerlist.div.viewcontent.div.viewgrouping      border 1px solid a8a8a8        codepre  pBut according to Firebug the element is not getting that style.p  pHeres the desired outcome I dont need help I dont think with the actual style code I just need a hand figuring out how to address the correct elements given how frakkin awfully theyre nested.  img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comoXHW9.png altenter image description herep

Negative 11204 pIm creating a small program obviously, and in one part of the program, Im trying to create a scrollbar. The parent window is inhabited by three label frame widgets. One of these label frames is to display as many as 50 option menus which, obviously, is too many widgets to display in one window at a time so, naturally, a scrollbar is desired. Now, I know you cant use a scrollbar to scroll a label frame, so inside this label frame Ive created a canvas, which can be scrolled. Ive then inserted a frame inside the canvas, which Ill use to display the option menus. I then attach a scrollbar to the canvas, and the scrollbar is placed inside the label frame. The problem is that the scrollbar looks functional, but only the first 10 option menus are visible, no matter how much it appears Ive scrolled. Here is an example belowp  precodefrom Tkinter import   app  Tk app.titleExample App app.geometry550x400300300   Creating the first label frame entryframe  LabelFrameapp,textEntry,width250,height250 entryframe.packsidetop,fillBOTH   Creating a frame to contain the options selected by the user also using a canvas amp   label frame to enable the use of a scrollbar outcomesframe  LabelFrameapp,textUser Input,width250,height650 outcomesframe.packsideleft,fillBOTH outcomescanvas  Canvasoutcomesframe,reliefSUNKEN outcomescanvas.configwidth230,height650 outcomescanvas.configscrollregion0,0,300,1000 outcomescanvas.confighighlightthickness0   Creating scrollbar scrollbar  Scrollbaroutcomesframe scrollbar.configcommandoutcomescanvas.yview outcomescanvas.configyscrollcommandscrollbar.set scrollbar.packsideright,fillY outcomescanvas.packsideleft,expandYES,fillBOTH   Creating the frame in which the option menus will be inserted outcomesframe2  Frameoutcomescanvas,width230,height1000 outcomesframe2.packsidetop,fillBOTH   Creating the third label frame statsframe  LabelFrameapp,textThird Label Frame,width250,height250 statsframe.packsideright,fillBOTH   Creating the option menus for i in range50     vars[labeltextstri]  StringVar     vars[labeltextstri].setMenustri1     vars[labelstri]  Labeloutcomesframe2,textvariablevars[labeltextstri]     vars[labelstri].gridrowi,column0      vars[variablestri]  StringVar     vars[variablestri].setSelect...     vars[menustri]  OptionMenuoutcomesframe2,vars[variablestri],Option1,Option2     vars[menustri].pack  app.mainloop codepre  pThanks for the help, its appreciatedp
Negative 11204 pWhat my script does is, first it checks to see if any archived event files in CWindowsSystem32winevtLogs are older than 7 days. If they are it deletes them.p  pThe second thing that it does is any remaining Archive.evtx files ones that are newer than 7 days it will zip up and send to whatever path you specify.p  pNow my problem lies with the fact that my desktop runs Windows 7 professional and the script was running 100 correct last night while I was putting the finishing touches on it. Now my laptop runs Windows Home Premium, so at work today when trying to run the script from my laptop all of a sudden it does not work.p  pIt will make the zip file in the correct path but it will not actually put anything in the zip file.p  pNow at home I had to run the script as administrator to get it to work, which required me to make a registry edit that I found online to even add the Run as administrator button when you right click a .vbs file. Wierd that this isnt there already but whateverp  pSo I made the same edit on my laptop, tried to run it again, and same thing happened. Empty zip file in the correct path.p  pSo next I figured that something was up with the UAC messing around with it. So I turned off the UAC on my laptop and then ran as administrator but it still ran into the same problem. At home my UAC is still turned on and the script works so I am not sure at all what the issue is.p  pThen I thought maybe on my laptop I was having a permissions problem with the C drive or something odd like that. So I opened cmd as admin and ran a takeown to make sure that the drive was allowed to be accessed by admin.p  pThen went and ran the script again, still ran into the same problem.p  pIm about out of ideas now of why it will not run, when I get home from work I am going to try it on my desktop again and see if it still works. It should, Ive made no changes to the scriptp  pIf anyone could help me out here that would be amazing.

Negative 11204 pId like to make a serial port available over the network. a hrefhttptools.ietf.orghtmlrfc2217 relnofollowRFC2217a provides extensions to Telnet to transport extra serial port info such as speed, data bits, stop bits, and hardware handshaking lines.p  pHowever, I want to ensure its not freely accessible to just anyone on the network, so I want to do authentication and encryption.

In the same method I set the object the apps delegate.p  precodeimport Foundation import objc import AppKit  class MountainLionNotificationFoundation.NSObject, Notification      def notifyself, title, subtitle, text, url         NSUserNotification  objc.lookUpClassNSUserNotification         NSUserNotificationCenter  objc.lookUpClassNSUserNotificationCenter         notification  NSUserNotification.alloc.init         notification.setTitlestrtitle         notification.setSubtitlestrsubtitle         notification.setInformativeTextstrtext         notification.setSoundNameNSUserNotificationDefaultSoundName         notification.setUserInfoactionopenurl, valueurl         AppKit.NSApplication.sharedApplication.setDelegateself         NSUserNotificationCenter.defaultUserNotificationCenter.scheduleNotificationnotification      def applicationDidFinishLaunchingself, sender         userInfo  sender.userInfo         if userInfo[action]  openurl             import subprocess             subprocess.Popen[open, userInfo[value]] codepre  pNow I expected codeapplicationDidFinishLaunchingcode to be called upon a click on the notification. Unfortunately that never happens. What am I doing wrongp

I want to keep it realistic and use Python. I want to draw the simulation in a hrefhttppygame.org relnofollow titlePygame websitePygamea.p  pIn my program I ask for a couple of variables the mass and the radius. The radius will be used to calculate the volume of a sphere and the mass will be used to calculate the buoyancy, gravity force and acceleration. p  pBut the thing is, to keep everything in SIunits I ask for the radius in metre. Doing this while keeping my radius under 10cm, makes for a really small number. And when I use the Pygame module to draw a sphere at the size of 0.1m, it fails. So instead of doing that, I needed to use a bigger scale.p  pSo here comes my main problem. How exacly should I scale the sphere Say I wanted to define 100 pixels to be 1 metre. I would then have to multiply my radius by 100, since that would be the scale, but now that the sphere is bigger should the velocity also be multiplied by 100p  pIve gotten really confused over this Thanks for your time.p  pDont know if you need to see this, anyhow.br Calculations.pyp  precodeimport math  class Formulas     def initself         self.pi  3.1415926535         self.gravity  9.82 ms2         self.densitywater  1000.0 kgm3         self.densityair    1.29 kgm3         self.dragsphere    0.47      def objectbuoyancyself, volume, mediumdensity         buoyancy  volume  mediumdensity  self.gravity N         return buoyancy      def objectgravityself, mass         gravityforce  mass  self.gravity N         return gravityforce      def objectvolumesphereself, radius         volume   1.3333333  self.pi  math.powradius, 3 m3         return volume      def objectmassself, density, volume         mass  volume  density kg         return mass      def objectaccelerationself, gravityforce, buoyancy, mass         totalforce  gravityforce  buoyancy N         acceleration  totalforce  mass ms2         return acceleration      def objectspeedself, acceleration, time, scale         speed   acceleration  floattime1000.0 ms         return speed      def surfaceareaself, radius         area  4  self.pi  math.powradius, 2         return area codepre

Negative 11204 pI had installed QTP 10 in windows xp, in a virtual machine. My application is web based. No additional addins required. No patches required either because XP, IE 7, and qtp 10 are compatible. My main OS is Windows 7 with IE 9. I dont automate there. I only automate in XP.br My framework worked perfectly fine. I did not face any problems with object spy, object repository, or record and playback. My framework is completely descriptive programmed. My tests ran just like it should.br Recently my hard drive crashed. The tech support people had to rebuild my system. They gave me a new hard drive and built a new virtual machine.  I had to reinstall all my software, including QTP v10 in vmware.br I ran my framework, it worked fine. I stopped my test to add additional code and ran the test again. This time it did not work. It gave an error message that it could not identify the parent object. Then I used object spy.br  It identified the objects on the web page as Window, and WinObject. I was confused as to why it was behaving this way.br  I restarted my qtp. Used Object Spy again, this time it was recognizing objects on the same web page as Browser, Page, Webelements.br  I did a simple record and playback to test it. It recorded my steps and played back the steps properly as it should. I rerecorded to add additional steps to the script, but this time it was not recording my steps.br I stopped the record and used object spy to see what was going on. This time it was identifying objects as WindowWinObject again.br  I then checked Object repository. It had the FIRST recorded objects in the repository, but not the later recorded steps. I used OR to pick up objects but it was recognizing the objects on the web site as WinObjects.br What causes QTP to behave this way I thought I would reinstall QTP. I contacted HP. They gave me instructions on how to do a clean uninstall. I followed their steps and did a clean uninstall by regedit and delete those HKEYUSER.. stuff.br I reinstalled QTP with Full admin rights and everything. But I am still facing the same problem. QTP would work fine at the first record and playback and it would run my framework fine, but after that first run it would not work. It doesnt identify web applications. ANY web application, not just the one I have to automate.br 1  It is NOT a problem with addinsbr 2  It is NOT a patching problembr 3  There is NO problem with the App I have to automate  p  pI believed it was the virtual machine Some problem with how they rebuilt it   Coincidentally, my coworker is also facing the SAME problem with her QTP.

Negative 11204 pIm migrating an interface to a database from InfoPath to a .NET Web App in Visual Studio. The SQL Server database is set up that the user executes a single procedure, which kicks off other procedures, which kick off more procedures, etc. For the entire database to complete its procedures a model run, it takes about 30 minutes.p  pAt the end of each of these single procedures, a record is inserted into a table called sysProgressAudit. I want to bind this table to a gridview in an update panel, so that it can constantly refresh and the user can monitor the progress of the model run. However, since the databind is also a postback, Im afraid that I wont be able to synchronously refresh the gridview while the model is running since the original stored procedure wont have returned fully.p  pIs it possible to refresh an update panel constantly within any PageRequestManager events What do you think is the optimal solution to having a longrunning query and needed to refresh a table at the same timep  pI suppose I could kick off the query and not have it return anything the original InfoPath method, but Ill lose a lot of errorhandling and exceptioncatching functionality...p

Negative 11204 pI have recently been writing a Java NIO based server with nonblocking sockets and Ive bumped in to some problems in regarding writing the data out. I know by now that there are conditions where nonblocking write fails to write some, or all of the bytes in a ByteBuffer. p  pThe way I currently handle such scenario is by either rewinding or compacting the buffer and later trying to send it again in next selection iteration. This how ever results in significant performance loss and it is imperative that I get the data sent fast.p  pI have attempted using something like p  precodeByteBuffer bb  ... SocketChannel sc  ... whilebb.remaining gt 0    sc.writebb    codepre  pBut the problem with this is the fact that it might write 0 bytes and still quit the while loop. Im not sure why, but it seems like write  method will hit ByteBuffers limit regardless of whether it actually sent all the bytes or not.p  pAnother problem Ive had with this writing method is when it sometimes under heavy load will cause a buffer overflow exception even when Im not attempting a blocking write.p  pI desperately need some advice on how to properly perform blocking write and what condition might cause SocketChannel.writeByteBuffer to overflow the buffershould it not stop when limit is hit.p  pThanks in advance.p  pEdit I still have not found the reason why sc.writebb would set position in buffer to bb.limit even if it wrote 0 bytes. My only resort remain to be rewinding the buffer after failed write attempt.p

Negative 11204 pBefore I begin, I have googled this to death and there are many posts about how to prevent the save prompt. I am having an issue showing the save prompt.p  pI am building the template editing portion of a document generation system in C. The system will edit dot and dotx files. Before outlining the problem, the environment I am using for development is running Visual Studio 2010 and Word 2010. It will eventually run on other versions, but i would like to get these versions functional first.p  pTo set the scene I have a form open that has a list of columns returned from a stored procedureData Source to add to the document as bookmarks. I have all of the bookmark and dragdrop operations functional. When I close the application, I catch the ApplicationEvents4DocumentBeforeCloseEventHandler event to close the form.p  pWhen I close the form, i check haw many documents there are open. If only one document is open, I close the application which prompts the user to save changes. If however there are multiple documents open Most people have a number of different word documents open concurrently, I locate the correct document and close it with the flag set to prompt the user to save changes.p  pThis is where the problem occurs. At this point, the save changes dialog never shows up and everything freezes up in Visual Studio. If I stop the debugging on Visual Studio 2010 the document flashes in the task bar indefinitely, and if you focus on it, it disappears and saves changes without a prompt.p  pThis is the code to handle the form closing eventp  precodeprivate void Form2FormClosingobject sender, FormClosingEventArgs e              if app  null                      if app.Documents.Count lt 2                              this.TopMost  false                 Word.Applicationapp.Quit                 app  null                          else                              foreach Word.Document document in app.Documents                                      if document.FullName.EqualswordDoc.FullName                                              object saveChanges  Word.WdSaveOptions.wdPromptToSaveChanges                         Word.DocumentwordDoc.Closeref saveChanges                         break                                                                  codepre  pThe problem is this line should show a save changes dialogp  precodeWord.DocumentwordDoc.Closeref saveChanges codepre  pI have tried debugging this without much luck.

Negative 11204 pSo I have this function where I am generating and returning my image a .bmp format. I want to put it into a word document.

Again, the initial defaultMap should be painted immediately, but it is not, the JFrame is black until everything is painted together at once minus the last green block. Then each green block should be painted on 1 second after the other.p  pThe interesting part is that the System.out.println bit in the move method in Gui prints out the row and col as Id expect it to... They come out about one second after the other in the terminal. So that tells me that something is going right. But Im not sure whats going on with the Gui...p  pEDIT slight difference in story. upon closer examination, I noticed that the last green block does appear for a second as soon as the entire map is painted but immediately disappears repainted white.p

Negative 11204 pIm a bit confused about where the application should send a bunch of files.  Let me suppose that an application accepts a number of images with strongNSOpenPanelstrong at a time from the user.  The application applies graphic filters to them.  And its now ready to save processed files.  Before they forced us to sandbox applications, we were allowed to export processed files to application folder in Application Support without strongNSSavePanelstrong.  If you wanted to save files elsewhere, then you had to use NSSavePanel.  If the application is sandboxed, it cannot send files to NSApplicationSupportDirectoryapp namewhich points to the containers folder assigned to this application  My first sandboxed application was rejected a few days ago merely because a text field showed a path to containers application support folder.  So if you have a bunch of files to export, you have to prompt the user to ask where to save each file  strongAppSandboxDesignedGuidestrong, which Apple, Inc. has issued, has nothing to say exactly about where to save files except that it says strongYour app has unrestricted readwrite access to the container and its subdirectoriesstrong.

Negative 11204 pIm trying to understand how platform independent socket communication works, because I would like to share socket data between a Java server and some native Unix and Windows clients. Sockets are platform independent by design, but the data representation is machinerelated, hence it is advantageous if the TCP data abstracts the real data format, because a data format that is supported on one system doesnt have to be necessarily supported on another.p  pFor example if I want to send an unsigned int value from a C client program to a Java server I must tell the server that this number should be interpreted as a negative integer. How does this kind of abstraction work With my limited knowledge I would just send a number as text and then append some kind of unique character sequence that tells the receiver what kind of data he received, but I dont know if this is a viable approach.p  pTo be a bit more concrete I would like to send messages that contain the following content  p  ol liAt the beginning of the message some kind of short signal or command so that the receiver exactly knows what to do with the data that will follow.li liThen some textual content of arbitrary length.li liFollowed by a number, which can be also text, but should be interpreted separately. li liAt the end maybe a mark that tells the server that the message ends here.li ol  pTCP processes the data in byte chunks. Does this mean when I write an UTF8 encoded char in one byte that this char is interpreted in the same way on different machines if the client machines take Javas big endian byte order into account Thanks for any input and help.p

Ive got this switch statement that watches for several numbers 2,3,13,45p  precodevar hello switch variable      case 2         do something irrelevant         break     case 3         do something irrelevant         break     case 13         do something with variable named hello. Ex.         alerthello         break     case 45         hello  hello         break  codepre  pAs you can see, I need to get the value of hello, before the variable gets a value. I cant change the order, nor I cant change variable declaration, so I have to do something with this setup.p  pWhat I thought was to make a function call in 13p  precodefunction getMyVariablevariable      var v  variable     return variable   case 13     getMyVariablehello     break codepre  pThen of course the function would still return undefined. p  pWhat Id like to do, is to make the function wait for the variable set in 45p  pnote that this is just speculation, this code is no way near workingp  precodecase 45     hello  hello     getMyVariablehello     break  function getMyVariablevariable      function gets call from case 13     if type is undefined, wait for a variable that isnt undefined     if variable isnt undefined return the variable  codepre  pSo basically at first call skip case 13, let case 45 set the variable, then go back to case 13 and execute the code here. Can you follow me Tell me if you need more infop
Negative 11204 pSo Im just trying to grasp this concept. In the image bellow you can see that the total width of the sub elements is 250px, and they are both surrounded by 10 px of padding..So to get the percentage we need to do targetcontext. The part I dont understand is that to get the percentage of the total width250px we calculate that based on the parents total width590px, but to calculate the percentage of the padding10px, we do so based on the parents inner width 570px.. So why is that or more specifically why isnt the 250px percentage calculated off the 570px also, as it would seem the 570px divs padding has no barring on the space taken up by the 250px block. What am I missing herep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comNPVa6.png altenter image description herep
Negative 11204 pIn my application, I have a codeUsercode model and codeArtistcode model. Both codeuserscode and codeartistscode should be able to follow multiple artists. Im not really sure how to describe this relationship, and Im completely lost regarding the underlying migration. p  pIve tried having codehasandbelongstomany artistscode in both classes, and an additional codehasandbelongstomany userscode in codeArtistcode, but that seems really messy, and I dont know how to write the migration. p  pIve looked at the a hrefhttpguides.rubyonrails.orgassociationbasics.htmlthehasandbelongstomanyassociation relnofollowassociation docsa for the migration Im not sure if it would be simpler to have a thirdclass and use a codethroughcode association, or if I would need one for usertoartist and another for artisttoartist, or if one additional class would be enough. p  pHelp appreciated, thanks in advancep

Negative 11204 pI converted my development SP 2007 content db to SP 2010 using database attach method from a Win 2003 virtual machine to a Win 2008 VM.  Everything worked fine on my old VM, and also works fine on our production server SP 2010, Win 2008 that was converted by an administrator.  But my new development VM seems to have an issue  We use a custom EditForm.aspx for one of our SP libraries to capture metadata from the user.  When the user selects Edit properties from the ECB of the library item, they get our custom EditForm we used SP Designer to change the default EditForm to user ours.  This EditForm application is installed under our SharePoint application in IIS.  In the EditForm code behind, we call the UpdateListItems web method of the SP Lists web service.  When it hits that line of code, it throws a 401 Unauthorized error.  Thats the problem.p  pI am using  DefaultCredentials in the code behind, impersonate has been set to true in the SP web.configs both the one under inetpubwwwrootwssVirtualdirectories and the one in the 14 hive Config folder and in the web.config of my custom EditForm.aspx application the web.config also has Windows Auth. mode set to ture in IIS I have only ASP.NET Impersonation and Windows Authentication enabled Anonymous, Basic, Digest, and Forms Auth are disabled.  In the inetpub log files, I see that the attempt to hit vtibinLists.asmx is using the NT AuthorityIUSR account not my current logged in acct., the Identity of the application pool for the SP app is Administrator, which is what I log in with Administrator has full privs to the farm, site collection, site, and library I can hit the SP web service via the browser if I change the web.config of my EditForm application to impersonate with an explicit acct Administrator acct and pw, then it works, but I cant use that because thats not how our production web.config is set up, and we would lose the ID of who made the change in the version history of the item.p  pSo, Im missing an impersonation delegation setting somewhere in my machine setup.  All of the existing code was ported to SP 2010 in Win 2008 without code mods or changes to the EditForm web.config file have compared production with mine, and it works there, just not on my VM.  I have seen many posts like this with the solution offered up as change your code, or use the explicit login id for impersonation, or change to Kerberos.  None of these solutions is an option for me.  I need to keep the code and web.config the same as what runs on production.  Besides, we want impersonation to work because we want the users credentials to be authenticated by the SP Lists web service, and not use some acct. that is always authenticated successfully security issue, and we want the version history of the updated library item to reflect the actual user ID who last updated the item, and it does that just fine on production.p  pThis question posted on StackOverflow was close, but the solution was to change to Kerberos, I dont have that option IIS 7.5 site using impersonation does not have permissions to access Sharepoint web servicesp

Negative 11204 pI am trying to test a resource created in Jersey using Mockito, but I seem to have hit a wall. Part of my resource involves returning a location header  which in turn is made up of the UriInfo injected at runtime. However when doing simple unit tests using JUnit4, the uriInfo is not being set  is there any way around thisp  pThanks in advancep
Negative 11204 pWhen you use the addheader directive in nginx, the header is added to the response coming from the origin server.p  pSay the origin server returns cachecontrol public, maxage60. But in the nginx reverse proxy location you set something likep  paddheader cachecontrol public, maxage10p  pWhat does this do exactly There are 2 different scenarios I can think ofp  p1 Nginx respects the cachecontrol header from the origin server and stores the content in its cache with an expiration of 60 secs. Then passes on the response with an overwritten header causing the client to store the resource in its cache with an expiration of 10s.p  por..p  p2 Nginx overwrites the response headers first and then interprets them. It stores the resource with an expiration of 10 secs and passes the response to the client which also caches the it with an expiration of 10 secs.p

In complex sentences, however, there are multiple verbs, and thus multiple subjects and objects. It is possible to consider complex sentences like this as multiple sentences using the first part of the independent clause as the root, and replacing the second part with each of the dependent clauses, but usually the first clause is the most important and could be considered the main topic of the sentence.p  pDoing a simple BFS to find the first NP prior to a verb will result in officials being the subject, since it is at the lowest depth level. This doesnt capture the intuition of the first clause containing the subject. One approach I tried was searching for the NPs in the first base S node i.e., lowest level subtree rooted at an S node, but in this case that would capture nodes rooted at Ssub3sub.p

Negative 11204 pMy brain hurts, so I need help to solve this issue. I have read about many similar encoding problems but I cant find any info that helps me with this particular issue.p  pI have a PHP service which reads data from database. It sets the charset to p  precodemysqlsetcharsetutf8, con codepre  pBasically it then executes a query and loops thru the db items like thisp  precodewhilerow  mysqlfetchobjectresult    rowgtMyField1  utf8encoderowgtMyField1   rowgtMyField2  utf8encoderowgtMyField2   ...   res[]  row  codepre  pand ends withp  precodeprint jsonencoderes codepre  pI then read the data from Ruby a sinatra app withp  precodeuri  URIstr source  NetHTTP.geturi src  JSON.parsesource src.each do s      Display s.MyField1 in HTML here....  HTML page is HTML5 and ltmeta charsetutf8gt end codepre  pThe problem is that I display strings like p  precodeALLMNHETENS KNING codepre  pwhere codecode is some unknown character to me. It should properly be codecode in the first occurrence and codecode Swedish A with ring diacritic a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiRingdiacritic relnofollowhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiRingdiacritica.p  pIs it the PHP code that is wrong Or the Ruby code If anyone could point me in the right direction I would be very grateful Frankly I dont know where to start chasing bugs.p
Negative 11204 pWe have crashes in our Unity iOS app.br We cannot reproduce them when debugging, but we regularly catch this crash.   p  pWe tried to analyze crash logs. crash log is in the bottom of the post We examine part of code mentioned in crash log mController... methods, and cant see something that could cause crash.br We tried to imagine situations that can occurs in that part of code, but see nothing that can lead to crash. There are emsmallem  array of strings which is loadaed from disk, and modified. We thinking of rewriting this part of code, but we afraid that otherp part of program can affect and lead to this crash, and that crash will remain after rewriting.   p  pWe tried to add trycatch block in this part of code and process situation when exception occurs gracefully move user to our apps main menu, but we have to remove this block due to requirements  to our app.   p  pAlso, I think that crash occurs only or at least much more frequent in Adhoc build which uses Release configuration in Xcode. In parts of crash logs you can see monogcoutofmemory in GCmalloc, which is looking very strange to me I thought that iOS generates memory warning when memory is low, but possibly mono has its own constraintsp  pAlso, there is another one or two crashes in this part of code with different crash logs without monogcoutofmemory, but , but strongall of them occurs in methods of ArrayListstrong   ArrayList.Clear in other situations.p  pCan you help us with this situation Can you give us any advice please on how should we deal with this crashesp  precodeException Type  EXCBREAKPOINT SIGTRAP Exception Codes 0x0000000000000001, 0x00000000e7ffdefe Crashed Thread  0  Thread 0 name  Dispatch queue com.apple.mainthread Thread 0 Crashed 0   MyApp                           0x00f0e150 CrashedCheckBellowForHintsWhy CrashReporter.mm73 1   MyApp                           0x00dcd888 mwrapperruntimeinvokeobjectruntimeinvokedynamicintptrintptrintptrintptr  200 2   MyApp                           0x01462eec monojitruntimeinvoke  2152 3   MyApp                           0x01504f24 monoruntimeinvoke  132 4   MyApp                           0x015050a8 monoruntimedelegateinvoke  128 5   MyApp                           0x0150931c callunhandledexceptiondelegate  340 6   MyApp                           0x0150b230 monounhandledexception  328 7   MyApp                           0x01473080 monohandleexceptioninternal  952 8   MyApp                           0x01473918 monohandleexception  64 9   MyApp                           0x0148f6d8 monoarmthrowexception  184 10  MyApp                           0x00e76ecc throwexception  44 11  MyApp                           0x014b7f44 monogcoutofmemory  16 12  MyApp                           0x0156a62c GCgenericmalloc  452 13  MyApp                           0x0156a6cc GCmalloc  140 14  MyApp                           0x015045fc monoarraynewspecific  272 15  MyApp                           0x00dd27ac mwrappermanagedtonativeobjecticallwrappermonoarraynewspecificintptrint  68 16  MyApp                           0x00b7b2b8 mSystemCollectionsArrayListInsertRangeintSystemCollectionsICollection  212 17  MyApp                           0x00b7b898 mSystemCollectionsArrayListAddRangeSystemCollectionsICollection  52 18  MyApp                           0x001fc3fc mControllerPrepareSkinsstringstringstringstringstringstringstring  1600 19  MyApp                           0x001fda88 mControllerAwake  4972 codepre

Negative 11204 pIve written a fairly complex program which simulates the behavior of small celllike organisms in a particle system.p  pThe simulation goes through a few stages where it calculates the next position for each object in the simulation. A motion member function is called for each particle and organism in the simulation, which updates its displacement vectors in the case of the organism, it handles AI and motion. The render function then iterates through each object and draws the appropriate shape at each objects new displacement.p  pThe displacement calculations for each object are done several hundred times before a frame is rendered, which allows the simulation to run much faster.p  pIn this process, it is impossible to calculate the next position of the objects without knowing the current position due to the serial nature of the process, so I cannot give a block of frames to calculate to several different threads  each frame relies on the calculation of the previous one.p  pAs I mentioned before, the new positions of each object are calculated by iterating through each object and calling a current objects member function which calculates the new position for that particular object. I was wondering whether this process could be done in parallel  calculate one quarter of the objects on one thread, another quarter on a second thread, etc. Is this method possible, and would it improve the speed of the calculations for each frame when there are huge amounts of objects in the simulationp

Negative 11204 pI want to validate my iap receipts both nonconsumable and autorenewable subscriptions for both iOS 6 and iOS 7. p  pSince Im using a server to follow best practices for iOS 6, I want to use it for iOS 7 too mostly for the subscriptions.

For iOS 6 everything is ok, but in iOS 7 there is much confusion. p  pIn the a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiOSreleasenotesGeneralValidateAppStoreReceiptChaptersValidateRemotely.htmlapplerefdocuidTP40010573CH104SW1 relnofollowreceipt validation documentationa it says that to validate an autorenewable subscription receipt we send the JSON object with the shared secret and we get a response with a specific status. p  pDoes that apply to iOS 7 Its not very clear to me. p  pThe status of an iOS 7 receipt refers to the app receipt itself not to a specific in app purchase. So then if I have to check each iap entry in the app receipt eg. to compare the iap expiration date to the current date will I have to implement app receipt parsing on my server p  pAlso is there a way to notify which specific purchase I want to check  Im guessing no.p  pWill I have to use my server for iOS 6 and ondevice validation for iOS 7 And if yes, how Sp

Negative 11204 pI am new to Stack Exchange and this is my first question so please forgive me if I do not ask this question conforming to the normal standards of this website.  If you have any tips that will help me become a more efficient member please feel free to let me know.   p  pFirst off, I am having a problem with my Java plugin in Firefox.  Under tools, addons, I have listed for my Java plugin, JavaTM Plugin 10.51.2 10.51.2.  I recently installed some updates and apparently the new version of Java automatically blocks unsigned applets from being able to run even if you attempt to allow it manually by clicking on the Allow Now option that is displayed in the URL bar.  This is unacceptable as I am currently trying to test software and I need to be able to run the applet.  p  pSo to get back to the question, how can I remove that specific Java plugin JavaTM Plugin 10.51.2 10.51.2 and install the icedtea7plugin for Firefox to use in its place.  I have installed the icedtea7plugin via terminal through the sudo aptget install icedtea7plugin command with success but how can I get Firefox to use this plugin and disregard the plugin that is currently listed under the addons option in my browser.  Any help will be greatly appreciated as this is a frustrating matter.  Thank you very muchp  pDavep  pstrongEDITstrong It is important to note the reason that the OP was asking about allowing unsigned applets was that he is developing on one. This question is therefore on topic as it is about a tool used for software development.p

Negative 11204 pI currently have a number of ViewModels in my WPF application that requires data from a WCF service. Currently, each ViewModel stores a reference to a different serviceproxy. The problem is, the WCF is not closing gracefully server is reporting unexpected closing of the connection on application exit and if the user is idle for long periods the connection times out.p  pI was thinking about two different ways to use the WCF within my applicationp  ol lipCreate the serviceproxy within the ViewModel and access the data within a Using statement so that I am only keeping the connection open for short periods.pli lipUse a singleton of the WCF that all ViewModels can access for each call.pli ol  pThe problem with 1 is that I made calls to the WCF for CanExecute methods to determine if buttons are enabled or disabled on my GUI. I am concerned that making so many proxies is going to be expensive and slow.p  pThe problem I see with 2 is one I am already noticing if a WCF connection is idle for long periods, it times out and the proxy is faulted. That means even more error handling.p  pIf anyone has a good pattern for this sort of data access, Id appreciate any insight.p  pstrongEDITstrong I get that using the WCF is a bad idea for the CanExcute.

Negative 11204 pI work on a Django based app, and I want to know if theres a way to know if my server uses http connections or https.p  pI know that usingp  precodeimport socket if socket.gethostname.startswith codepre  pI can get the hostname, is it possible to do something like that so I can get to know if the hosting uses a ssl certificatep  pstrongPDstrong Im a rookie here, so Im asking to see if its possible and, if it is, how should I do it. Thanksp
Negative 11204 pI have an app that posts data to a server. This data is only posted if the user is within a certain distance to a location. I regisered for background location updates in hope that would allow me to keep the background going. But after about 1718 minutes, the background stops executing.p  pI thought it might have been because of the locationManager.pauseslocationupdatesautomatically. But even when I set that to false, the app still terminates at around 17 minutes. Here is the code for my app delegate.p  precode   BAAppDelegate.m   Beacon App    Created by Huy Ly on 21013.

So Ive currently resorted to serializing an object and check it serializes correctly essentially duplicating the serializer testp  pAny ideas are very welcome.p

I need to use local dbs ident as the conidtion.  e.g. update local set status  disabled where ident  1.p  pI am able to compare the hashes with positive results using the code below.p  precodeuse strict  my remotehash       ident    gt 1001,     name     gt remote hash name,  my localhash        ident         gt 1,     remoteident  gt 1001,     name          gt remote hash name,       status        gt active   foreach sort keys localhash     unless exists remotehash         print  not found in Remote hashn         next        codepre  pBut, I do not understand how to use the code to pull out the ident for updating the db entry.  One of the methods Ive tried, and what seemed to make the most sense to me wasp  precodeforeach my test sort keys localhash     unless exists remotehash         print  not found in Remote hashn         print testident         next        codepre  pWith this, I will receive the following error Cant use string 1 as a HASH ref while strict refs in use Additionally, if I dont call the ident, and run the code as p  precodeforeach my test sort keys localhash     unless exists remotehash         print  not found in Remote hashn         next        codepre  pIt breaks the whole thing, and sees all records as a mismatch. I am not sure how to approach this further.  Can some one assist me in the direction to correct the problem I am havingp  hr  pEdit  In reply to simbabque.  I think I made a gross misrepresentation of the hashes. Here is a better breakdown of the hashes in question.p  pWhen dumping the remote hash, this what I get.p  precodeVAR1  1001 VAR2  NAME 1 VAR3  1002 VAR4  NAME 2 VAR5  1003 VAR6  NAME 3 VAR7  1004 VAR8  NAME 4 VAR9  1005 codepre  pWhen dumping the local hash, I getp  precodeVAR1  [                        ident             gt 1,             groupname            gt NAME 1,             status        gt active,             uniqueid             gt 1001,           , codepre  pFor the remote hash I turned an array into a hash by doing the followingp  precodemy remotehash foreach my datapair remotehashlist     my ident  datapairgtident     my groupname  datapairgtschedgroup        groupname  ssg      remotehashident  groupname  codepre  pI am kinda of winging this, so I am not sure if this is even the right method of turning an array into a hash.  If I dump the array remotehashlist I getp  precodeVAR1             ident       gt 1001,           schedgroup gt NAME 1,          codepre  pWhen I tried the method youve explained, the hashvalue is empty. I assume though, this has to do with how the hashes are builtp

Negative 11204 pIm making a multiscreen game in Kivy. On the main screen we have a set of buttons that each have their background normal property set to a png image. Each of the buttons leads to a separate screen where the user answers a question. Once the question is answered, the question screen leads the user back to the main screen. What wed like to do is update the color of the button using a different png file as background to indicate to the user that a question has been answered. p  pRight now weve created a method in the main screen that changes the background color when a question in the background screen is answered correctly. By printing to the terminal we have been able to confirm that the color has been changed. However, when the app goes back to the main screen the color has not been changed. We think this is because the main screen is being reset when the user returns to it. What is the right approach to make the color of the button on the main screen not only conditional on a question being answered on a separate screen, but also permanent p  pThanksp

Negative 11204 pI develope currently a small sample app with fragments and a viewPager. The viewPager shows 3 pages. In each page i instantiate a fragment of the same type. The fragment contains a textView and a button. On button click I want to replace the current fragment with another one. Now my problem is, no matter which button I press only the fragment of page 1 gets replaced. I dont know what I have to do in my pageAdapter class but I guess it has to do with using the same fragment and layout. I think I have to make sure, that my pageAdapter updates the correct page, but how do I achieve thatp  pFor a better understanding why I want to achieve that, that I receive a json string within 3 node of type menu and I want to use each of them as a page in my viewPager.p  pCan someone show me a short and easy example for such a behavior I think its a basic approach, so it cant be so difficult.p  pEditp  pHere is the codep  precodepublic class FragmentPagerSupport extends FragmentActivity  static final int NUMITEMS  4 MyAdapter mAdapter ViewPager mPager  Override public void onBackPressed      FragmentManager fm  getFragmentManager     if fm.getBackStackEntryCount gt 0          fm.popBackStack      else          super.onBackPressed        public MyAdapter getmAdapter      return mAdapter   public ViewPager getmPager      return mPager   Override protected void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState      super.onCreatesavedInstanceState     setContentViewR.layout.fragmentpager     mAdapter  new MyAdaptergetFragmentManager, this     mPager  ViewPager findViewByIdR.id.pager     mPager.setOffscreenPageLimitNUMITEMS  2     mPager.setAdaptermAdapter      Button button  Button findViewByIdR.id.gotofirst     button.setOnClickListenernew OnClickListener          Override         public void onClickView v              mPager.setCurrentItem0                    button  Button findViewByIdR.id.gotolast     button.setOnClickListenernew OnClickListener          Override         public void onClickView v              mPager.setCurrentItemNUMITEMS  1                 codepre  pMyAdapterp  precodepublic MyAdapterFragmentManager fm, FragmentPagerSupport fragmentPagerSupport  superfm this.fragmentPagerSupport  fragmentPagerSupport   Override public int getCount  return NUMITEMS   Override public Fragment getItemint position          Fragment newInstance  null         switch position          case 0             newInstance  frag1.newInstanceposition             break         case 1             newInstance  frag1.newInstanceposition             break         case 2             newInstance  frag2.newInstanceposition             break         case 3             newInstance  frag2.newInstanceposition             break                  return newInstance      codepre  pFrag1 amp Frag2 amp ListItemFragp  precode    public static class frag1 extends ListFragment      int mNum     static frag1 newInstanceint num          frag1 f  new frag1         Supply num input as an argument.

I made it as an MSI setup file by using cxFreeze.p  pWindows shortcuts produced by .msi setup files generated by cxFreeze do not provide the working directory property of the shortcut. Thus, when I run the executable using the shortcut created on the desktop, its creating database files on the desktop itself.p  pThis can be changed by providing a different working directory to the shortcut.

Negative 11204 pIs it possible to detect the final placement of a popup window I have a custom popup that renders below a specified UI element and I would like it to draw a border relative to its position to the specified UI control.

Negative 11204 pI have a view that has a large table with about 700 rows. In Chrome, Firefox and Safari when running in development on my local machine, the page takes 23 seconds to load. Recently I deployed the app via Rubber, first to a Vagrant VM on my machine, then to EC2. In both cases, when deployed, the page takes about 60 seconds to load on Safari, but works OK on Chrome and Firefox. p  pI have a canvas element on each row and I have a javascript function DrawCircle that decorates a canvas on each row of the table with a colored dot with a number superimposed. That is fairly expensive, but according to what I can see in Safari developer tools, is that normally, after the page is downloaded there are about 4050 events associated with DrawCircle, but in the pathological case there are thousands. So what Im guessing is happening is that normally, only the elements that can be seen in the viewport about a dozen or so rows are rendered before the page is shown, but in this case it renders all 700 rows.p  pThe rails 3.2 environment per se does not seem to be causing this, because I have tried copying my development.rb environment file to production.rb and deploying, and the same problem occurs. I deploy using unicorn and nginx, but I also use unicorn in development, so there should be very little difference other than the URL.p  pI would share some code, but I cant think of what could be relevant. Please ask.p  pUPDATE While I was trying to track this down, my development environment suddenly started to have the same issues as production. So that solved one mystery the difference between production and development and added another why did it change suddenly. Anyway at this point Im going to consider this just a quirk of Safari that makes it render my bad page badly and go back to work improving the page. epascarellos tip helped a lot.p

Negative 11204 pI am creating an application which contains a ViewPager with five views. Im using codeFragmentStatePagerAdaptercode for the five tabs. Each tab contains view inflated via codeFragmentcode.p  pIn all those five tabs there are several number of images coming from server and some additional data For ex  tab one contains seven images with some supporting related text data , means by that tab contains seven views which I am switching the view using codePagerAdaptercode  and all that seven images are switching by swipe gesture using a codeViewPagercode for each viewimage  text.p  pAnd there are four other similar tabs also.p  pWhen I open this screen the heap memory is drastically increasing previously I was using  p  ol lipVolley library for Image Caching since there are frequent use of images. But when I analysed the .hprof file in Memory Analyser Tool , I found the ImageLoader is occupying very much amount of memory pli lipUsing codeandroidlargeGeaptruecode in android manifest tag  , which is    definitely not the right approachpli ol  pBut even then codeImageLoadercode is increasing drastically. So I removed the codeImageCachingcode from that page and store the images in internal storage and recovered them when needed again without downloading from the server.p  pI failed to manage the heap memory resulting in OutOfMemory Exception and crash and unresponsiveness.p  pIs there is any problem in codeViewPagercode OR codeViewagercode inside codeViewPagercode or there is any other issue resulting in memory leak.p

Negative 11204 pIm currently doing development on an android app that requires me to read all the contacts on a device and select only specific contacts based on criteria only contacts that have at least 1 valid mobile number and all email addresses linked to that contact. p  pFrom what ive tried the recommended approach at a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma195639993262731httpstackoverflow.coma195639993262731a but on a test device with approximately 800 contacts, retrieving all the records and then filtering takes about 1720 seconds.p  pIdeally id love to build the criteria into a query that joins the contacts,phone and email store tables in the contacts db as opposed to filtering in my code.p  pDoes anyone have any suggestions pleasep  pThanks and much appreciationp

This is rather strange since the crash described above should be associated with the callback execution.p  pcodectypescode documentation statesp  blockquote   pAlso, note that if the callback function is called in a thread created   outside of Pythons control e.g. by the foreign code that calls the   callback, ctypes creates a new dummy Python thread on every   invocation. This behavior is correct for most purposes, but it means   that values stored with threading.local will not survive across   different callbacks, even when those calls are made from the same C   thread.p blockquote  pBeing a complete newbie to codectypescode, I understand this emdummy threadem is a thread of the process which performed the system call and, maybe, this process gets terminated before the call is executed.  This question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions15952086usingthreadinglockinctypescallbackfunctionUsing threading lock in ctypes callback functiona seems to support that idea.

Negative 11204 pI am very curious about this tidbit in the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryc440x2ebvvs.100.aspx relnofollowdocumentationa for this methodp  blockquote   pReturn Value   Type System.Int32   The zerobased index of the first item found returns 1 if no match is found, strongor 0 if the s parameter specifies Empty.strongp blockquote  pI simply cannot fathom of what use is it to someone to have this method return 0 if the supplied string is Empty. Remember that the return is supposed to be a zerobased index of the position of the matched string in the combobox. So when you get a return of 0, with this method, it can either be that the string you searched for was in position 0, or that the string you searched for was Empty. The same result for two very different situations.p  pAnd what happens if you are specifically searching for an Empty string, which happens to be in position, say, 5 This method would then return 0, nop  pI just want to understand what is the intention of this little caveat, and how to use it properly.p

Negative 11204 pIm creating 2 tables, one called emusersem and the other called emimagesem, each user can have one avatar which refers to an image in emimageem table, yet each image has an author to identify who uploadedcreated the image, and this author references to a user in emuserem table, and I added foreign key constraints for both, so these 2 tables become mutually dependent, and that makes the insertdelete operation a mess...

Negative 11204 pedit this was entirely my error, likely due to rushing things at 4am.  The code was technically sound and working fine, though thank to the comments I have removed some redundancy to make things a bit smarter.p  pIm working on a class project that deals with Java supersubclasses and inheritance.  While 90 of the code works just fine, one minor thing doesnt seem to want to work and Im a bit perplexed as to why.  Basically, were creating a new class called CompactDisc that contains information such as product code, Description, Price, and Artist.  When the user enters the appropriate code sgtp, the console will output the information.  Unfortunately the Artist line is always blank, despite giving it data.

Negative 11204 pI have a ton of identical SKSpriteNodes added to my scene, all with the same zPosition, layered on top of each other according to the order they are added to the scene.  I need to be able to pick one SKSpriteNode, and add another at the same index plus or minus one.  I know I can use codescene.insertChildmySpriteNode, atIndexindexcode but how do I get that index from a SKNode or SKSpriteNode I have looked through the documentation, and online, there must be something I am missing, it seems like it would be so simple My ideal solution     codescene.insertChildmySpriteNode, atIndexsomeSpriteNode.siblingIndexcode  but I do not see a property on SKNode like siblingIndex, or maybe it would be called indexInParent.p  pI suppose I could keep count of every node I add to the scene, and subclass SKSpriteNode and set my own index, but I add nodes in a couple different places.  This would be tedious and easily broken if I try and change my code later.p  pMaybe I could iterate through the entire children array property on the scene until I found the node  the node I am searching for, but this is very expensive and inefficient.p  pAnd using the zPosition is not ideal because I am using zPosition for a few other layers in the app, and the amount of SKSpriteNodes that can be added is unlimited, so eventually I would break through to the next layer.p  pHopefully someone tells me I have simply overlooked this property somewhere Any help is appreciated thanksp

Negative 11204 pA few years ago, I was Rick Rolld badly. I was sent to a website where the classic Never Gonna Give You Up by Rick Astley music video was playing. When I went to exit the webpage, a confirm dialog box popped with the the first line of the lyrics to the song. I pressed OK, but then another box popped with the second line of the lyrics. This looped until I went through the entire song many dialog boxes had popped up and it then finally let me close the webpage.p  pHow would I go about implemented something like this in my code for a webpagep  pI have searched all over the internet and have came across multiple threads about using onbeforeunload or similar methods within HTML and Javascript, but all of the answers that pertained to this only allowed the developer to customize the message shown when the user tries to leave the site.

Negative 11204 pIm attempting to use a batch file to keep all files in a particular folder numbered sequentially 0,1,2,....

Negative 11204 pAre there any plugins or ways to download the dependencies for a maven project from Jenkins I am using Jenkins for a multimodule desktop application. Although I know I could just archive all dependencies, I dont see why there isnt the ability to download dependencies using maven which installed on the same machine as Jenkins. Preferably one would specify the location of a pom and then have the ability with one click to download all the dependencies for that pom. Can you do this I do not need or want an entire binary repository for this feature.p  pstrongEditstrong I will try and rephrase this as I dont think people are understanding.p  pIn Jenkins one has the ability to archive artifacts at the end of a build. Also in jenkins you have integration with maven. When building a jar in maven you have arguablly 2 optionsp  ol liYou can either use the assembly plugin which zips all .class files together with those produced from your source code resulting in 1 jarli liYou can create a jar just source code which references all dependency jars which are located in a separate folder.li ol  pIn Jenkins one also has the ability to download the latest artifact. Now if I am using strongOption 2strong, I can either archieve just the jar which my sources produced, which I would say is more desirable for space and is the whole purpose of the archive functionality, or you can also archive the libraries too.p  pHere is the strongPROBLEMstrong If I dont archive the libraries then I cannot easily run this jar, as it is a desktop application and its dependencies cannot be obtained in the same mannor as clicking on a link from jenkins. So lets say my question is what is the easiest way to obtain them Extra info assume jenkins is running as a server and you cant use artifactory or another server application, that seems to me to be massive over kill.p

Negative 11204 pI have been tasked with testing an existing application, and Ive done so with my own in the past, but I am a little unsure of whether I am using the right approach.p  pLets say I have the following examplep  pClass codeuserscode has a function called codegetAllcode which returns the list of users by querying the database. There are as far as I can tell two straightforward ways to test this functionalityp  ul lipUse the same query code that the codegetAllcode function uses, independently in the unit test. Then, perform the codegetAllcode call and assert the results. pli lipHave a data provider give the unit test data that is of the format that is expected, hardcoded to values we know are contained in the database. For example, we would pass a hardcoded array containing all users in the format the the codegetAllcode function expects, and assert the results.pli ul  pAlthough the second approach seems more in line with testing, it has the added results of adding a layer of security risk. Anyone with access to the test suite would also have plaintext access to a lot of potentially sensitive data. On top of that, depending on database size queries like the above could make the tests ridiculously long for very little reason.p  pWhich would be the preferred approachp

When Im using a more classic way, like loginpassword, to authenticate users, I just need to check the credentials on the server side and return a token.

If I call a service with just the user id returned by OAuth2 authentication, I dont have  security at all. Anybody can call my service with a random id and get some informations about my users.p  pIm probably missing something simple in the process, but after searching for hours for a solution, I havent found a good explanation.p  pIf I add a service returning a token when registering the user id, anybody can call it and get a token, so this is not more secure...p  pI can add an app token to check that this is my app which is calling the service. This is a little more secure but anybody can reverse engineer my app to find the token...p  pThanks for your help.p

Negative 11204 pI currently have 3 buttons that are inline. Im having issues in how to style these buttons so the width is automatically calculated to take the width of the parent div.  For example, if the parent div is 1000px, Id like the width of the inline buttons to be 10003  a set margin to space these buttons. So those need to be taken into account which will be fixed.  Catch is, the first and last element should not have a left margin and right margin respectively. This way I can dynamically add buttons and the styling should take care of the width. Hope that helps p  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netLyej20nk relnofollowJsFiddleap  pHTMLp  precodeltdiv classrow stylewidth 1000pxborder 1px solid 999gt   ltdiv classrow stylepaddingbottom20pxgt     lta href1 classbtnlg btndefaultgtMy Buttonltagt     lta href2 classbtnlg btndefaultgtMy Button2ltagt     lta href3 classbtnlg btndefaultgtMy Button3ltagt   ltdivgt ltdivgt codepre

Negative 11204 pI am simply trying to get undo working for the actions a user performs in my app. By default, any text editing the user does has the benefit of undo, but any actions that are done otherwise from my code does not.p  pI can see the documentation explains that I need to get an instance of NSUndoManager and call registerUndoWithTarget, but I am stumped with the first step getting the undoManager from within my ViewController.

Sorry, I am very new to this. Can anyone point me in the right direction Am I supposed to implement my own undoManager or something There is clearly an undoManager somewhere because anything a user does manually in my textField is getting undo behavior. It seems like this would be a singleton that I could access easily from a ViewController.p  p Edit BTW, the code above was placed in viewDidLoad and removeLatestEntry is just a function in my ViewController that takes a string and prints it at this point.p

Negative 11204 pCurrently I am working on converting a monolithic SVN repository all applications and libraries in a single repository with mostly C code to a git repository. I would like to have organize it so that the libraries and applications are in their own repository. p  pI am, however, struggling to find a good way to handle internal i.e. our own code and overlapping dependencies. The problem exists because many libraries and applications depend on each other  often quite deep. p  pFor instance, imagine the following quite simple project structurep  ul liapp1 depends on lib1 lib2li lilib1 depends on lib2 lib3 li lilib2 depends on lib3 li lilib3 does not have dependenciesli ul  pApp1 could be a game, lib1 a graphics library, lib2 a math library and lib3 a utility library. Keep in mind that the libraries are also used in many other applications and are often updated. p  pIdeally I would want to have a situation where I get the following directory structure when I clone app1p  ul liapp1 ul lilibs ul lilib1li lilib2li lilib3li ulli ulli ul  pand I get the following when I clone, for instance, lib2p  ul lilib2 ul lilibs ul lilib3li ulli ulli ul  pI have thought about using git subtree or submodules, whereby each project records its own dependencies. However, the project directory layout would then become something like this for readability I removed the inbetween libs directoryp  ul liapp1 ul lilib1 ul lilib2 ul lilib3li ulli lilib3li ulli lilib2 ul lilib3li ulli ulli ul  pAs you can see lib3 and lib2 get placed in the project multiple times. Obviously that is not desirable.p  pI could solve this by writing a custom script for each application and library that clones all the relevant dependent repositories. When I do this however it becomes difficult to keep track of the exact state of the code at a specific commit. p  pIs there a good way to handle internal and overlapping dependencies with git Or am I struggling because I am trying to achieve something that goes against the way of doing things in gitp

Negative 11204 pI have taken a graph, and pulled out a subgraph from it, using FlashGraphs, which gives me an igraph with vertex names spread out throughout the range of vertices. I attempt to write the edgelist using codewrite.graphsub.fg,lcedgelist.txt, edgelistcode but when I do so, I get a file that looks like this,p  precode0 251 0 268 0 840 ... codepre  pThe file should look likep  precode237 368616 237 374864 237 1197066 ... codepre  pIt seems that this just assigned vertex ids instead of using the names, so to check, I derived a list of vertexes from the main graph, where I just took all the vertexes with that id using the following command. codelcc.v lt whichcc  lcc.idcode I would just convert these vertexes by using the list of vertexes that I had also derived from the main graph, but from checking that reference, 368616 isnt the 251st vertex, its 697. If it is possible to write the graph in terms of the vertex names assigned in the main graph, that would be the best solution, but anything that explains why the vertex numbers dont line up or a way to line them up would help as well.p

Negative 11204 pI need to restrict a web api,  preferably using asp identity. The logic for the api isp  ul liAuthenticated users do CRUD on their data suppose regular users has a regularUser role li liManager role can only  do CRUD on users entity. That means create, delete, edit and view users. li liAdmin role can do CRUD on everything. li ul  pThe problem is how to restrict access to users data. In the case of users entity I can restrict on roles admin or manager, but if I restrict users data based on admin or regularUser role, it is possible that user A can modify or delete data from user B. In this case I need to restrict access so p  ul liAdmin role has access to users data li liregularUser can create data, or modify deleteview their own data. li ul  pHow can this be achieved with asp identity I know a way would be to get data and check first if its owned by the user, but this business logic needs to be in every method. Its possible to simplify this with method properties And if the Web api is using owin,  its necessary to crate a Middleware p

I even neednt to declare it in the .h file, if the class function is a private one. So I think objectivec is more convenient than c when declaring a class.p

Negative 11204 pI have a classification problem, where the development of a featuretriplet over time respectively samples, should allow a classification in authentic or copy. Each triplet is extracted from one frame of a video sequence.p  pPlotting the sequence of triplets over time samples, reveals that there is a humanobservable difference in graphsimilarityp  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comFgpES.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comFgpES.png altGraphs and gradientsap  pI checked that samplewise over multiple data sequence, and the behavior is always the same. The graphs are very similar just offset in ydirection for sequences belonging to class copy, while the development of the tripletsequences belonging to the authentic class show at some local samples e.g. X2,13,25,.. significant difference resulting in nonparallel graphs.p  pSo, my first sensibly working approach is using gradients and putting a threshold, declaring a sequence as belonging to class authentic as soon as the gradients of the three curves showed significant difference. Obviously, as long as the graphs are similar and just offset, they have theoretically identical local gradients. This works well for distinguishing between those two sequences.p  pHowever, this approach fails if there is some humanobservable difference in curvesimilarity X9, around X30 in next example but the absolute value of gradients is so small, that the difference in the curves results in a gradient value close to noisep  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comlTQsE.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comlTQsE.png altExample, which cannot be easily distinguisheda p  pStill, in the closeup of this problematic authentic sequence, one can see that the curves are even intersecting each other X9 note this is not always the case, hence intersections are no suitable classification criteria. p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.com6YUNg.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com6YUNg.png altCloseup of authentic sequenceap  pstrongMy questionstrong Whats a sensible classifier or combined feature to distinguish between such sequences in my twoclass problem p  pPlease note that the sequences are of different length and samples correspond to points in time and classification is done live.

Negative 11204 pI am having consistent issues with the Reachability class reporting incorrect state and losing notifications from Tony Millions reachability class. Although something similar has been reported a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions19367351tonymillionreachabilitysaysunreachablewhenconnectedherea I would like to add more information that may or may not be useful in resolving my variation of the problem. p  pFirstly, Im using the latest Xcode Version 6.3.2 6D2105 and am working on a Macbook Pro connected via Wifi and have downloaded the latest Reachability class as of today by post date 5 Aug 2015 which I have set up as an instance that I pass around my iPhone application not a singleton pattern. p  pSecondly, and probably quite importantly Im using the strongiOS simulatorstrong in order to get the application behaviour correct before deploying it to an iPhone.p  pIm taking advantage of both the notification mechanism, and also the direct isReachable method depending on my usage about the code  notifications for triggering syncing and status bar updates and the isReachable for conditional method calls. The reachability class is instantiated in the app delegate using this stylep  precode[Reachability reachabilityWithHostnamehostAddress] codepre  pAnd the reachability notification service is started using the p  precode[reachability startNotifier] codepre  pmethod. Now, when the application starts, the reachability correctly indicates network access be that up or down and I also receive notifications as expected. p  pIf I simulate the network failing by turning of Wifi Turn off wifi from the computers perspective I correctly receive the notification that the network is no longer reachable. But when I turn Wifi back on again I receive another notification which also tells me that the network is no longer reachable  even though it is. In addition, the isReachable method also reports incorrectly.p  pNote that I call isReachable immediately after the result of a notification from NSNotificationCentre. I also ask for isReachable calls on different threads does this matter Occasionally I simply dont get reachability updates at all, and eventually the notifier just seems to stop working.p  pAny one have any thoughts on what Im doing wrong here Thanksp
Negative 11204 pI have a project named emappprojectem abbreviate here as strongAPstrong that have a module emappem.

I want to leave same directory hierarchy level. I dont want to add Intellij modules dependencies  too unless sure work, cause before I reach the first worked configuration, I have a lot of problems doing this. p  pEDITp  pBased on a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq175366524785114this answera and a hrefhttpsgithub.comethankhallAndroidComplexBuildtreemasterAndroidTopProject relnofollowthis example projecta I change somethings in my own project to make it more correctp  pstrongAP projectstrongp  pemsettings.gradleemp  precodeinclude libandroidnetwork, libandroidnetworklib projectlibandroidnetwork.projectDir  new FilesettingsDir, ..libandroidnetwork projectlibandroidnetworklib.projectDir  new FilesettingsDir, ..libandroidnetworklib codepre  pemappbuild.gradleemp  precodecompile projectlibandroidnetworklib codepre  pstrongLAN projectstrongp  pemsettings.gradleemp  precodeinclude libandroidbase, libandroidbaselib projectlibandroidbase.projectDir  new File settingsDir, ..libandroidbase projectlibandroidbaselib.projectDir  new File settingsDir, ..libandroidbaselib codepre  pemlibbuild.gradleemp  precodecompile projectlibandroidbaselib codepre  pBut Im still getting the same errorp  pError39, 0 Project with path libandroidbaselib could not be found in project libandroidnetworklib.p  p EDIT 2 p  pit works if I repeat the emsettings.gradleem configuration of network project into app project, but p  precodeinclude libandroidbase, libandroidbaselib, libandroidnetwork, libandroidnetworklib projectlibandroidbase.projectDir  new FilesettingsDir, ..lib androidbase projectlibandroidbaselib.projectDir  new FilesettingsDir, ..libandroidbaselib codepre  pBut I guess I shouldnt have to repeat this configuration in my base application whenever I had to add a dependency to libandroidnetwork project.

Negative 11204 pI am currently working on evaluating the differences between a legacy proprietary search tool and Solr.  One of the things Im trying to do is make fuzzy phrase synonyms.  For example, in our legacy tool, we could define a synonym like manage  account and it would match manage account, manage my account, manage my online account, etc.  From there, we could expand the synonym to match on queries like change my address and update phone number.  I know how to do the expansion synonym part in Solr, but I was wondering if theres any way to match fuzzy phrases like this so that I can define them in my synonym list.p

Negative 11204 pThis is my first attempt at writing a Visual Basic app using Visual Studio. I am using an Access 2013 database as the source and everything was going fine until I decided to add some calculated fields to one of the tables. Now VS is telling me that I need the Microsoft Office 14.0 Access Database Engine OLE DB Provider to read the tables. p  pIve been searching and searching but cant find anything about version 14.0 of the engine. Am I just missing something simple, or can I not access calculated fields in the DB and have to just pull the data and do the calculations in the app p  pI am working on a machine with Win7 64bit, Office 2013 Pro, and Visual Studio 2015 Community. p  pThanksp  pEDIT The calculated fields look like this p  pa hrefhttptravellermap.comapijumpmapsector relnofollowhttptravellermap.comapijumpmapsectoraLeft[Sector],4amphex[Hex]ampstyleprintampjump3p  pWhere [Sector] and [Hex] are fields in the same database. As soon as I added the fields to the database VS2015 would throw the error. If I tired use the Dataset Wizard it would tell me that there were fields in the database that were missing or could not be read without v14 of the engine. p  pThen even after I removed the calculated fields it still could not read the data. I have to revert to a backup copy of the database that never had calculated fields in it to get things back to working. p  pMy exact steps were as followsp  ul liCreate database with multiple tablesli liCreate a view that pulls together data from all the tables that I needed.li liCreate dataset in VS that uses that view which I called SystemMasterli liBuild app around it using the XAML designerli liDecide that it would be quicker to use a calculated field int he DB than write the VB code to put together a URL that is needed to display an image in the app.li liClose out VS2015 and laucnh Access 2013li liCreate the calculated field in the primary table and edit the SQL code for the view to include those fieldsli liSave and close Access, go back into VS2015li liView the dataset to see if the new fields are there, see that they are not and launch the Wizard only to find out that the Wizard says it cant access anything in that view anymore because fields are either missing or cant be read with the current version of the Access engine 12.0 and that I need version 14.0. li liSearch for answer, dont find one. Remove the fields from the tables and try to get back to a working application. li liRealize that even after removing the fields, VS2015 wont read the tables ro views that had them. li liRevert to a version of the database that did not have the calculated views, and everything works again. li ul  pWhile I know that the proper way to do this would be to construct the URLs in the VB code, this was easier and quicker in theory to do at this point which is basically a proofofconceptprototype. p

Negative 11204 pMy application is a communications server that receives TCP messages from a web server and then rebroadcasts the message to a number of iPads. Its a windows forms application in C. Program.cs creates an instance of the primary form and then that form creates four threads that do the communications work. There is a thread that listens for messages from the web server, a thread that processes the incoming messages into the data that needs to be transmitted and a thread that handles sending the outbound messages. The fourth thread does database cleanup and spends 99 of its time sleeping. p  pThe problem Im seeing is the GUI locks up with a load is placed on the system. On incoming message may represent 50 or 100 outgoing messages. While testing Im restricting they system to only send 5 messages out at a time, so it requires a longer transmission time. The sending process is using async call backs, but even it it wasnt, I cant understand why load on the tread could be stalling the GUI thread.p  pIm removed a much of the cross thread communications from the thread to the GUI for status update. The pattern for communications to the GUI isp  precodepublic void StatusOutputstring myString      if this.lbStatus.InvokeRequired              this.lbStatus.BeginInvokenew DebugOutputInvokerStatusOutput, myString          else              lbStatus.Items.AddmyString         while lbStatus.Items.Count gt 501                      lbStatus.Items.RemoveAt0                  lbStatus.SelectedItem  lbStatus.Items.Count  1      StatusUpdate ... codepre  pCan anyone give me any advice on how to pursue this I though threads were completely isolated from the GUI and couldnt load it. p  pThanksp

Negative 11204 pHi Im wondering if anyone has run into this problem before. Im trying edit my websites css so I can display all the contents of the site, including the header and the footer inside a frame on the background image. Im using the backgroundsize cover for the the full screen responsive background and have set up padding on the body to place the content with the frame. This works but the only problem is, using the cover keyword results in the background image being stretched or some of the edges being cut off, making the area of the inside frame vary a lot as the screen size is changed. This makes it difficult to position the content exactly with the frame at different screen sizes, which Im trying to achieve to make the site responsive.

Negative 11204 pI have a page that displays a button up top with codeidbuttonlinkcode. Just after the button theres another div with id of codedisplaycontentcode.

One of those elements is another button with id codesecondButtoncode. When the user clicks that second button, I want to make another AJAX call to a different place and pull different content to display in the codedisplaycontentcode div. This, however, does not work. The jQuery script is on the page, its loading correctly and the HTML elements are also properly displayed on the page after the first AJAX call but it seems that the codesecondButtoncode is not part of the DOM and the click events are not triggered when clicked upon it.p  pAny idea what is going wrong and how can I register click events for this dynamically added buttonp

Negative 11204 pHi there i have a code which ideally should store the time of which it was last modified for each of the sheets in the workbook.
