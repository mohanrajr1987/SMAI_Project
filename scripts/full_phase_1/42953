Positive 42953 pCan someone please point me in the right direction Id like to generate a list of help desk tickets, with their respective child tickets if exists listed directly below them. This will ultimately be an SSRS report, but I just dont know if the logic is best handled in the SQL query or in SSRS groupingsortsetc.p  pOur Help Desk system allows for tickets to be designated as child tickets of a parent ticket i.e., a ticket is generated by a user, and the tech then creates a related new ticket child ticket for some backend work from our network guys. Im working on a SSRS report that lists all open tickets over 60 days old. Id like any child tickets to be located directly beneath the parent ticket and sorted by date created.p  pThe report is grouped, initially, by location. Each ticket record, whether the ticket is a child or parent, will display the same data Ticket No, Ticket Subject, Contact, Date Started, Status, etc., and all tickets will have a unique ticket number. So, this is largely a groupingsorting issue. Ideally, once in SSRS, Ill be able to format the group heirarchy, so that child tickets are visually distinct in some way indented, borderslinesetc.p  pI just cant wrap my head around the logic. I can provide code if it helps, so you can see the existing query, but I primarily just need an idea of which direction to go.p  pEDIT I should add that all tickets have a PARENTID field, which is NULL if the ticket is not the child of another ticket.p  p2ND EDIT Read up on CTE recursion, felt good about it, then was reminded that Im working with SQL Server 2000. I might have to get creative. Maybe this will be the motivation required to upgrade to 2008R2. Any ideas for this type of recursion on a turn of the millennium database management systemp  pThank you,p  pRobertp

Crystal Report is managing these in the Data Layer of the web app like thisp  precode                DataRow drVol  vols.Rows.Findnew Object[]  id, idEzd                  if drVol  null                                      if drVol[Volume]  System.DBNull.Value                         cRow.Volume  isNormalReport  Convert.ToDecimaldrVol[Volume]  Convert.ToDecimaldrVol[Volume]                     else                         cRow.Volume  0                      dset.Compradores.Rows.AddcRow                  codepre  pSo in this case I verified that RS is giving me an X amount of rows while CR is giving me another amount of rows.p  pThe Idea is to duplicate this on an expression or VB code inside RS. As you can see, we have to filter the codedrVol  nullcode, RS is bringing all the rows. p  pI know a Lookup function can be used in this case asp  precodeLookupFieldsid.Value amp FieldsidEzd.Value, Fieldsid.Value amp FieldsidEzd.Value,FieldsGivemethisfield.Value,Dataset codepre  pBut can I use this Lookup expression inside a code to count The counter should be something like this Then I should add the lookup or an if that equals that vlookup, can the code see the two datasetsp  precodeDim count0 as integer Public Function Counter as Integer  count  count  1 return count  End Function  Public Function GetCounter  as integer  return count  End Function codepre  pThen create a Calculated Field for example Counter with the expressionp  precodeCode.Counter codepre  pAnd then make the sum of that calculated fieldp  precodeSumFieldsCounter.Value codepre  pBut is not working, not even the counter, is giving me 0.p  pSorry if I made a mistake in the Visual Basic code, I dont program in Visual.p  pEDIT2 I saw some workaround on MSDN, something likep  precodeLookupFieldsid.Value amp FieldsidEzd.Value, Fieldsid.Value amp FieldsidEzd.Value,FieldsGivemethisfield.Value,Dataset.Lenght codepre  pIt makes sense as a lookup is an Array.p  pThe problem is, either if I choose one scope or the other, I still have the problem that some fields cant be seen for example if the fields codeidcode and codeidezdcode are on Dataset1 and codeGivemethisfieldcode is on Dataset2, it will either not see the id,idEzd or Givemethisfield.p

Positive 42953 pI would like to ask your opinion and give feedback on my solution. If possible, someone could advise anything, way around and how to make things work effectively. p  pstrong1. Let me first explain what is needed and what we have.strongp  pMy employer has audit management system which helps working with control projects that contains all the data of projects information, work done, dates, issues found, recommendations. After completion of every project a complex report is to be generated.p  pReport is formatted Word document containing heading, body, couple of tables to be filled manually and list of field, which are to be filled with project data automatically. p  pThe system has builtin report constructor based on XML and Word template .dotx, but its capabilities are not enough to generate large and complicated reports takes too long time.p  pstrong2. What Ive come to and decided to implementstrongp  p1 Ive created and formatted a Word template and XML links to fill         easy data like project code, aim, background, datesp  p2 The main body Ive managed to extract only from database         directly. So, Ive written my SQL code. Then, to present it in         readable way Ive decided to use SSRS. So, the person types his         parameters and get output from DB directly.p  p3 Then a person exports SSRS report into WordExcel and copypastes         it into generated Word template.p  pstrong3. The problems arestrongp  p1 You have 2 split documents Word report generated from     template and SSRS export file WordExcel. p  pAre there any workarounds to merge them automatically End users     need the process of report generation to be as easy as possible, one     button click desired.p  p2  From SSRS you get table, but the data needs to be formatted as     text or at least 1 column, 1 row table with transparent borders.     Okay, Ive managed to get 1 column, but still multiple rows.p  p3 The formatting of result export file from SSRS may be very ugly     and quite different from Word report, which requires manual     formatting.p  pI hope someone could help me solve any of these or propose a different solution.p

Negative 42953 pI believe there is a way to do this, but Im not familiar with ORACLE 10g as many other people are. Heres the scenariop  pIm currently converting Classic ASP pages to ASP.net 2.0. I have a query that is creating a report. Its reporting Sales vs. Previous Sales. What is happening currently is one query is going out to the database and grabbing a complete list of locations that sell our products. Then, it loops through every single row of the locations, and runs some summing operations in SQL.p  pIt goes out to a few other tables, sums up sales quantities, then adds the sum to a table row, etc. Since the locations query returns a lot of results, the query takes a good 23 minutes.p  pMy question is how can I consolidate these all into one query.p  pLOCATIONS QUERYp  precodeSELECT DISTINCT t.location,    l.city,    f.year,    f.customer FROM loc t,  location l, fathertable f  WHERE f.number  t.number  AND f.code  0001  AND f.ccode  01  AND t.location l.code  AND t.code IN C, S  AND t.cocode IN G, V, A, D  AND t.year  2008  ORDER BY l.city, f.year codepre  pThe sum query for each of the rows in the above query is thisp  precodeSELECT SUMnvlt.salequantity,0 salequantity  FROM loc t, fathertable f   WHERE f.number  t.number  AND f.code  0001  AND f.ccode  01 AND f.year  2008  AND t.code  C  AND t.location  1566 lt EACH ROWS t.location VALUE AND t.cocode IN G, V, A, D  GROUP BY t.location, t.code, f.year codepre  pInstead of looping through each record of the original query, is there a way I can combine the queries and have the SUM in the Locations query.

However, if the user taps the text for ENTER YOUR NAME nothing happens. This is also expected.

However, due to the alignment of the text in the UITextField, I cant do things like left or right justification. It must remain as centered text. Thanks for any assistance you can provide.p

Negative 42953 pIm really stuck here... Ive built a small gallery to display images.p  pIt consists of an initial front page with 12 thumbnails arranged in a grid. When click on a thumbnail they collapse to the left of the screen and show the appropriate gallery item. When you rollback over the collapse thumbnails they expand and hide the gallery item underneath. You can now select another thumbnail which will collapse the thumbnails again and show another gallery item.p  pIm pretty happy with everything so far except for when you click a second third, forth etc... thumbnail. It fades up the old gallery item and then switches to the new gallery item once its loaded.p  pThe way I think Ive written the script is to fade out the DIV containing the node content and then use a callback to execute the ajax .load method to load the new gallery item in as well as doing some other bits to content within this DIV. I then fade the DIV back in after the main image has loaded. It looks like the .load displays the element that its being called on as soon as it is executed.

Negative 42953 pI need to build a rulebased system that can be run and developed in both C and Java for a chemistry application. The system needs to be able to get computed properties of objects through existing libraries and make decisions on those values. I am not sure what the system will look like but the rules need not be formally consistent we use a lot of heuristics. As far as possible the rules should be externalised so users and developers can modify them without needing to know about the engine which should be Open Source and run on both platforms. Its possible that the system will be run through a restricted set of naturallanguagelike commands. There will be an element of adaptation  new objects or at least vocabulary can be added.p  pThis is not as hairy as it sounds  a great deal of progress was made over 30 years ago using FORTRAN but the field has lain fallow.

However, I couldnt figure out how to make the text links load AJAX.p  pAfter trying to figure it out, I wondered if the UI Tabs were even something I needed.

But I was able to trial and error my way through it to get it working, almost perfectly for what I wanted, but the fade in and out of the hidden section was all messed up. The visible section was perfect.p  pHeres what I came up with.  Like I said, I am deep in the learning process so excuse this code if its just wrong for whatever reason.p  precodedocument.readyfunction         websites.hide         hitlogo.addClassactiv              hitlogo.clickfunction      this.addClassactiv     hitweb.removeClassactiv     websites.fadeOut1000     logos.fadeIn1000            hitweb.clickfunction       this.addClassactiv      hitlogo.removeClassactiv      logos.fadeOut1000      websites.fadeIn1000        codepre  pI gave up trying to fix the issue with the fade and moved onto something else. Though I was pretty proud of myself when I was able to add and remove the classes when each one was clicked so I could style them as I needed.p  pI quickly just used the code you gave me to load the pages and it seems to be working, I just have to add some fade.p  pShould the html page that gets loaded in be written up in any specific way  Right now its just the group of elements that were inside the original page and nothing else. Viewed on its own, thered be no CSS styling or any other elements.  Am I missing something or is this just how it is for those with JS disabledp  pI appreciate your help.  Its fun learning.  I mastered html and css a while ago and its about time I get to learning this now.  Its intimidating as hell at first, but I think Im slowly starting to grasp the concept.p  pThanks again.p

Negative 42953 pComing from OO C, Java, Scala I value very highly the principles of both code reuse and typesafety. Type arguments in the above languages do the job and enable generic data structures which are both typesafe and dont waste code.p  pAs I get stuck into C, Im aware that I have to make a compromise and Id like it to be the right one. Either my data structures have a codevoid code in each node  element and I lose type safety or I have to rewrite my structures and code for each type I want to use them with.p  pThe complexity of the code is an obvious factor iterating through an array or a linkedlist is trivial and adding a codenextcode to a struct is no extra effort in these cases it makes sense not to try and reuse structures and code. But for more complicated structures the answer isnt so obvious.p  pTheres also modularity and testability separating out the type and its operations from the code that uses the structure makes testing it easier. The inverse is also true testing the iteration of some code over a structure whilst its trying to do other things gets messy.p  pSo whats your advice codevoid code and reuse or typesafety and duplicated code Are there any general principles Am I trying to force OO onto procedural when it wont fit p  pstrongEditstrong Please dont recommend C, my question is about Cp

Negative 42953 pThis is a question about tradeoffs.p  pImagine a social network. Each user has a status message, that he can change anytime. Whenever he does change it, all his friends are notified through a wall like in Facebook.p  pTo make this work.

This is bad. However the good point is that to retrieve notifications for a specific user it is really fast, since we have a clustered index on the toUserId.p  h22nd optionh2  precodeCREATE TABLE Notifications  toUserId bigint NOT NULL, [identity] bigint IDENTITY1,1 NOT NULL, fromUserId bigint NOT NULL, data varchar256 NOT NULL, CONSTRAINT [PKNotifications] PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED [identity]  CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX [IXtoUserId] ON Notifications toUserId ASC codepre  pstrongSend notificationsstrongp  precode Get all friends of fromUserId.

Negative 42953 pWe have issues within an application using a state machine. The application is implemented as a windows service and is iteration based it foreaches itself through everything and there are myriads of instances being processed by the state machine.p  pAs Im reading the MEAP version of Jon Skeets book C in Depth, 2nd ed, Im wondering if I can change the whole thing to use linq expression instances so that guards and conditions are represented using expression trees. p  pWe are building many applications on this state machine engine and would probably greatly benefit from the new Expression tree visualizer in VS 2010p  pNow, simple example.  If I have an expression tree where there is an OR Expression condition with two sub nodes, is there any way that these can implement the observer pattern so that the expression tree becomes event driven  If a condition change, it should notify its parent node the OR node. Since the OR node then changes from false to true, then it should notify ITS parent and so on.p  pI love the declarative model of expression trees, but the deferred execution model works in opposite direction of the control flow if you want event based live conditions.p  pAm I off on a wild goose chase here Or is there some concept in the BCL that may help me achieve thisp

Negative 42953 pIve been a user of a hrefhttpwww.ultraedit.comproductsultracompare.html relnofollowUltraCompare Proa since it first came out, and I think its a very fullfeatured compare and merge tool. However, since I have been looking more closely into DVCS, I found that it handles threeway merges differently than most other tools out there. So I wonder why that is, and whether Im missing something because of it.p  pIn UltraCompare, there are three merge panels lets call them base, local and other. All the merge action happens within these panels. In practice, this means that I do my work on the middle pane local, merging changes from the right other or maybe from the common ancestor on the left base. The middle pane is modified during the session and then saved  and committed as the result of the merge. The fourth pane Output window only contains information about the diff result.p  pimg srchttpwww.ultraedit.comassetsimagesfeaturemapucthreewaytext.png altScreenshot UCp  pIn other tools, it appears that the three panes only exist in a readonly state, and that the fourth, bottom pane output is the place where all the merging happens. What are the reasons to have an extra merge window Is it easier to keep track of all the changes Or is it just like that because everybody has always been doing it this way, so were copying that behavior Whats your opinion on thisp  pimg srchttphginit.comi04kdiff3after.png altScreenshot kdiff3p  pIm not sure whether there exists a best or correct answer, so I havent yet made this question CW, but Ill defer to your opinion here as well.p

Negative 42953 pIs it possible for a multimap to contain within it pairs IE, rather then being defined as codemultimapltchar,intgtcode for instance, it would be defined as codemultimapltpair, paircodep  pHow would this multimap then be sorted Also, how would one access the individual contents of each pairp
Negative 42953 pIm implementing the session sharing structure from a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryaa479313.aspx relnofollowthis linka for an ASP classic site to begin the gradual conversion process to ASP.NET. Im trying to extend the cookie expiration time so that users do not get signed out of the site when the session expires. At the place where the cookie is created in SessionPage.cs Ive added the line in the CreateNewSessionCookie methodp  precodecookie.Expires  DateTime.Now.AddDays14 codepre  pNow this works fine, however, it only works if the user first visits an ASP.NET page, and emthenem visits the ASP classic pages. It doesnt work if visiting an ASP classic page emfirstem looking at the cookie through firefox confirms that different expiration values are given based on if I visit an ASP or ASP.NET page first. Im still a bit fuzzy on the mechanics behind this implementation as I dont have a complete understanding of session and cookie handling. However, I would have thought that the VB6 SessionMgr object is calling the SessionUtility DLL, and thus is using the same code to issue the cookie. I have reregistered the SessionUtility using gacutil, and reexposed it using regasm. How else is the cookie being issued when a user accesses an ASP classic page How can I change the expiration timep

Negative 42953 pI know its an old JQuery library, but I am still using Thickbox 3.1 throughout my site. On Chrome and Safari, when you click a thickbox link, the iframed page pops up, but there is no preloader image. It goes directly to the page and waits on the popup until it loads. This becomes a problem when the popup is loading a lot of content and takes more than a few seconds. It seems broken to the user. What should happen, like it does on IE and Firefox, is there is a loading ajax image, that spins and waits for the popup to load until it disappears. Has anyone else had a problem with this and know how to fix the JS code for this I believe this is where it is calling it in the thickbox.js filep  precodeon page load call tbinit document.readyfunction      tbinita.thickbox, area.thickbox, input.thickboxpass where to apply thickbox   imgLoader  new Image preload image   imgLoader.src  tbpathToImage  codepre  pThanks anyone for the help.

Negative 42953 pI have a small Python program consisting of very few modules about 4 or so. The main  module creates a list of tuples, thereby representing a number of records. These tuples are available to the other modules through a simple function that returns them say, codegetrecordscode. p  pstrongI am not sure if this is good design however. The problem being that the other modules need to know the indexes of each element in the tuple. This increases coupling between the modules, and isnt very transparent to someone who wants to use the main module.strong p  pI can think of a couple of alternativesp  ol lipMake the index values of the tuple elements available as module constants e.g., codeIDXRECORDTITLEcode, codeIDXRECORDSTARTDATEcode, etc.. This avoids the need of magic numbers like codetitle  record[3]code.pli lipDont use tuples, but create a record class, and return a list of these class objects. The advantage being that the class methods will have selfexplaining names like coderecord.gettitlecode.pli lipDont use tuples, but dictionaries instead. So in this scenario, the function would return a list of dictionaries. The advantage being that the dictionary keys are also selfexplanatory though someone using the module would need to know them. But this seems like a huge overhead.pli ol  pI find tuples to be one of the great strengths of Python very easy to pass compound data around without the coding overhead of classesobjects, so I currently use 1, but still wonder what would be the best approach.p

I have an application that serves both internet clients and intranet clients, that is to say there are clients that are on the same physical network as the server.

With IPv4 I can determine this by checking the client IP address against the server IP address and the subnet so if my servers IP and subnet mask are respectivelyp  p192.168.123.15 255.255.255.0p  pAnd the server receives a client request from 192.168.123.100 I know that there is no router standing between the client and server. However, if the server receives a client request from 192.168.1.100 or perhaps 67.7.23.4 I know that there is a router standing between those clients and the server. In .Net I can gather the client and server IP addresses both v4 and v6 but I cannot find the IPv6 subnet mask. p  pIs there a way to gather this info in .Net or is there some difference between IPv4 and IPv6 that Im misunderstandingp  pstrongEDIT x2strongp  pI posted this on the MS connect site to see if its something theyre working on or if theres a reason they havent added an IPv6Mask property to the UnicastIPAddressInformation class.p  pa hrefhttpsconnect.microsoft.comVisualStudiofeedbackdetails643031unicastipaddressinformationclasshasnoipv6maskproperty relnofollowhttpsconnect.microsoft.comVisualStudiofeedbackdetails643031unicastipaddressinformationclasshasnoipv6maskpropertyap  pI also posted the same question on the MSDN forums around the same time. 1800 views and not a single reply.

Negative 42953 pWhen developing a class in C but I suppose this question is somewhat language independent what is the correct way to deal with dependencies between propertiesp  pFor example where I want to create a property B whose value is derived in some way from the value of property A. Property B is undefined and should not be called if property A has not been set. Throwing an exception in Bs getter if A has not been set hardly seems like an elegant way of handling this. Simply returning some default value from property B is not something I want to do.p  pOne way is to enforce initialization of A through the constructor, but lets assume that a default constructor with no arguments is required so this is not an option.p

Negative 42953 pI have been thinking how to display the validation messages into different sections of the form. I have an online quotation with single html form. I have put them into different section to ease the user enter the information based on the categories.p  pI have divided the form for example into the Customer Contact Details, Consultants Details, Customer Credit Card Details, Air Ticket Sections. Please note that the actual form is not as simple as this one. I want to do a jQuery validation on this form. The problem is I want to separate the validation messages base on its category. I do not want mix the validation messages into one. This will confuse the consultants, as this form is a fully dynamic form, and it can be consist for more than 100 fields for just only single quotation.p  pSo, for Customer Contact Details, the validation messages will only notify the user anything that is associated with the Customer Contact Details.  Anything that is not valid, the message will be displayed next to the associated field. Same thing for Consultant Details and Customer Credit Card Details.p  pHowever, it is different with Air Ticket Sections, where bunch of information are placed in a table. With the table format, the validation messages cannot be displayed next to the field. So, I am thinking to use jQuery errorLableContainer to display the messages.p  pAt this point of time, I only can think to use different html form. However, I do not want to do this. I want to keep it with single html form. Or, I can use jQuery groups, where I havent done the testing to use jQuery groups.p  pAnyone has any better idea to solve this validation messages Any thought would be appreciated. I am sure, someone out there are also having the same issues.p  pThank you.p

My question is, why is Cucumber usually coupled with RSpec for writing user stories when RSpec has had user story functionality since 1.1 Is it because RSpecs focus remains strong on individual object testing and Cucumber has since been heavily developed with emphasis on user stories p  pContext switching is a pain and we developers deal with enough tools. Id prefer to stick to just RSpec, but if there is some important distinctions that Cucumber has from RSpec, please do let me know.p

Negative 42953 pThis seems a known problem but I have not found a good workaround. I like the style of the nonnative QFileDialog, especially the feature that allows the user to input the path directly which is very convenient since the user can easily copypaste the folderfile name from other applications. However, it seems very slow when the dialog is first launched. The native option is quite responsive but the problem is that it does not provide an input field so for the user to select a folder heshe has to walk into the directory, which can take many mouse clicks and is not fun. I am not sure if you have experienced similar problem or if I miss something.  p  pBTW, my PyQt version is 4.4.3 and I am working on Windows XP.p  pThanks, Bingp

Obviously, if they are identical rows they would generate the same signature.pli lipI could then takes these generated signatures, with the index of the row they point to, and sort them all by their signatures.

Negative 42953 pI have a little dilemma with my query. In order for my code to be optimal I would like to do as little logic in PHP as possible and let MySQL take care of most the stuff.p  pSo this is what I have I have an array with e.g. 10 keys. Each key withholds an new array some values. Each value represents a row in the database table.p  pLets say my database table has 6 columns. the first one is a primary with auto increment. Column 2, 3 and 4 should be unique. Column 5 is a TEXT representation which should not be unique. Column 6 is a INT1 what either is 0 or 1. p  pNow, when I insert data into my table I use codeINSERT INTO mytable col2, col3, col4, col5, col6 VALUES col2,col3,col4,col5,1 ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE col5  col5, col6  0code This works perfect, but it does not accomplish what I need.p  pWhen I send in a the same array once again, but for key3, col5 row I change the data to something else, I only want col6 for that key to be updated to 0 the rest should stay 1. What happens now is that every row will get updated, even though it is updated with the exact same data. p  pSo, what I need is I only want to update col6 if col5 is different from the current saved value. How can I do thatp

Negative 42953 pIm writing a NSIS installer which elevates only after user chooses a path installing to which requires admin privileges. Obviously, I included MUIDIRECTORYPAGEVERIFYONLEAVE define, to allow the Next button to stay active even when the user chooses such a path. After user changes installation directory, .onVerifyInstDir is called where I am supposed to check for path validity and call Abort for graying out Next button. The problem is, .onVerifyInstDir is called only for valid paths, so if user enters something like sdfasdfas the function wont be called, and the Next button will stay active. Of course, I can verify path on leaving the directory page, but what I want is an inactive Next button for such cases. Any ideasp

Negative 42953 pIm trying to understand the lowlevel mechanics of CAS on x86x64 and Id really appreciate some helpinsight.p  pThe reason Ive been thinking about this is that Im trying to reason about exponential backoff, and figure out in principle what the correct single unit of backoff delay should be.p  pIf I look at a lockfree freelist benchmark, without exponential backoff, I see as the number of threads increase, performance rapidly flatlines.p  precodeRelease 7 LockFree Freelist Benchmark 1     M    N    S   L3U L2U L2U L1D L1D L1I L1I  P   P L L L L total ops,mean opssec per thread,standard deviation,scalability 0 0 0 1 310134488,31013449,0,1.00 0 1 0 1 136313300,6815665,38365,0.22  0 1 0 1 136401284,6820064,50706,0.22 1 1 1 1 111134328,2778358,23851,0.09  0 0 1 1 334747444,16737372,2421,0.54 1 1 1 1 111105898,2777647,40399,0.09 codepre  pAs we know, livelock can occur, where each thread prevents the others from progressing.  p  pMy original  and I believe now mistaken  thought was that CAS was interfering with CAS.  By that I mean, the CAS instruction itself would destructively collide with another CAS, should they occur concurrently.  Both would fail.  Prolly because I was in the back of my mind thinking about ethernet.p  pThis obviously explains the results  all those CAS instructions operating concurrently, very few have a chance to fully execute before being destructively interrupted.p  pHaving thought about it some more, I believe now this cannot be the case.  The CAS instruction does not in fact HAVE a failure mode.  It will tell you the destination is equal or not equal to the comparand.  Thats all.  It doesnt come back and say oh, sorry, bumped into someone else.p  pDestructive interference IS occurring, but its occurring at a higher level, in the data structure algorithm itself.  When we push or pop fromto the freelist, we are actually TRYING to swap.  We need the destination to be stable for long enough that we can read it, do whatever work we need to do, and then find it unchanged so we can complete our pushpop.p  pIf other threads keep CASing, destination isnt stable  it keeps changing  and we keep having to retry our operation.p  pBut now Im confused.p  pWhat we see is that a single thread performs about 30 million pushpop operations.  Destination has to be stable for the duration of one of these operations, for the operation to succeed, so we see there are 30 million slots.  If we have two threads, then the maximum theoretical performance we can have is 15 million operations per thread each thread using half the slots.p  pNow lets come back to CAS.  CAS has no failure mode.  So whats happening when second thread tries to CAS when another thread is already CASing  well, the second thread will fail at the data structure level, since the swap couldnt occur, so it will retry the swap.p  pBut now imagine we have LOTS of threads.  The first thread to begin a CAS will succeed assuming each CAS takes exactly the same time  not true, but that assumption doesnt change anything fundamental, so its okay to reason with.  All the others will fail.p  pBut once the first thread has finished, the very next thread who reads the new destination value will have his CAS succeed and all the other threads, still executing their CASs or now beginning new CASs, will fail.p  pSo why do we not see perfect scaling  because every slot should be being usedp  pI think therefore I do not understand CAS properly.p  pReading Intels Architecture Software Developers Manual, I find that if all data is present in cache which the situation Im interested in, the cache coherency protocol takes care of CAS.p  pDrepper in his white paper describes LLSC and how it works using MESI.p  pIt seems reasonable to me for CAS to operate in a similar manner.p  pLets consider the two thread case.  First thread begins its CAS.  The cache line with the destination is in its cache and marked exclusive.p  pSecond thread begins to CAS.  The first core sends its cache line over to the second core and both cores have that cache line marked shared.p  pFirst thread completes the CAS and writes to the cache line the write always occurs on x86x64, even if the compare was false it just writes the original value.p  pThe act of writing marks the cache line as modified a RFO occurs, causing the second core to mark its cache line as invalid.p  pThe second thread comes to complete its CAS and notices its cache line is invalid... and then, what  I find it hard to believe the instruction is in the CPU internally looped until it succeeds  although I wonder, because LLSC on ARM requires emyouem in your assembly to do this loop.  But the CAS instruction knows that the value of destination has changed, so the results of its compare are invalid.  But theres no error possible with CAS it always returns true or false for the compare.  But even if the instructions do loop until complete, Id still expect perfect scaling.  Each slot should still be used.p  pSo what happens  what emisem happening with CASp  pWhat I do see is that as the thread count rises, less and less work is done  all available slots certainly are not being used.  Something is causing this.  Is it destructive interference between CAS instructions  or it is a large number of RFO hogging the CPUnorthbridge busp  pWhat I do note with considerable interest is that two threads on the same physical core scale perfectly.  Something special and different is happening in that case  two threads on separate physical cores scale half as well.  But its not enough of a clue to explain it all.p

Negative 42953 pI am working on a large MVVM application. I am using the MVVM light toolkit for this. The application is like a web browser with back and forward buttons. The main view is an user control. I laid the back and forward buttons in the main view user control. The main view in turn has user controls. The user controls change when the back and forward buttons are clicked. The main ViewModel keeps track of the current user control and loads the next one depending on the button click.p  pAll these user controls are loaded depending on the selectionID made on the first step. Lets say, the main view is a search screen and we select a customer. The next screens would be Address, Billing, Requests, etc. These screens does not share any data. But the data is for the same customer.p  pSo, is it a good practice, to store the customer ID in the main view If I do this, I should have a UserControlLoaded event bound to a command, where I would then request for Address and Billing Info.p  pOr I can move the buttonsback and forward buttons to each user control instead of the main view, Pass the customer ID with the message which would load the next view.p  pWhich is betterp

Negative 42953 pIve been working with SVN successfully for a few weeks however I recently received an updated version of the code Im working on from our vendor. I overwrote my local installation with the updated files and was expecting to be able to commit the updates files and everyone else would then get the updated version. However, when I overwrite my local files, SVN does not detect that the files have been updated. Im using Tortoise SVN if that matters. p  pUpdate Im not copying over a working copy of the updated code there are no .svn folders in the source. However, I have noticed that the last modified dates on the files are older than the ones they replaced  Would that prevent SVN from detecting a change Also the majority of the files are encrypted using ioncube. p
Negative 42953 pHave a strange intermittent issue that I spent ages trying to get to the bottom of a few months ago, but gave up. Want to give it another look.p  pI have built a site using FUELCms, and im very happy with it. It seems however, that sometimes not all the javascript requests are fulfilled properly. I get errors in the firebug console and have to refresh the page with a ctrl F5 to get the scripts to download properly. It only happens when I am logged into the CMS, and there a lot of javascript requests going on. p  pThe errors I get in my console are unrelated and hard to replicate. Can be a different error each time. p  pThe request completes with a 0200, but when I look at the file that brings about the jS error, it is corrupted. Strangely, sometimes with sections of other js appended to the end of the file, or in the middle of the file. p  pI spent some time with the admin from FUELcms, and I thought I had got to the bottom of it, but think I was wrong. Noone else using FUELcms seems to experience this.p  pIt never happens on my xampp server on my laptop, only live.p  pIs this a problem with my host p  pBaffled.

Which file controls the TCP window size parameterp  pFurther, I would be very grateful for any good documentation on how the UNIX kernel implements the TCP congestion control mechanism. I dont want documentation on what the TCP control mechanism emisem I have read a lot about it, but information on the kernel implementation would be great.p  pMy motivation is to tweak the kernel to see if I can improve the performance. I know its a hard thing to modify the kernel, but I have made a few changes to the RTO section of the kernel code, and was able to successfully compile.

Negative 42953 pI am new to unit testing, just getting into it using Check for C.p  pThis is a question of unit testing theory. Lets say because it is true that I have a module of code that formats messages to and from a serial protocol. I have another module which implements a state machine sending and receiving those messages.p  pI am starting to write unit tests for the message send and parse functions, and plan to write tests for the state machine too. In each case I use mocksstubs to fake out the other module apologies if I am misusing any unit testing buzzwords here.p  pIs it also considered a good idea to test the two modules together So I would build the real state machine with the real protocol engine, drive it with wirelevel messages and see if the appropriate state transitions and messages came out.p  pIn theory this would already be covered by the individual tests, though..p  pLooking for some general clues, dont have enough experience to have a feel for this yet.p

Negative 42953 pokay so i am trying to be more efficient in my programming, by attempting to pass multiple strings as one char array[100].  I can pass all this info from my client perfectly fine, but am now trying to use substr or strch to remove the values i passed using the char array on the server side.p  pserver will look like this on the other end, with the data passed from the client being stored into memory under velrecp  precoderecvsock, velrec, 100, 0 codepre  pThe program is set up to send some basic numerical data to a threaded server to run computations on and return results.

I was attempting to use them to break out my original strings, but without success.  I just want the server to receive this char array and copy sections of it into strings.  I am assuming this is possible, but if not I could always send multiple char arrays through, it just seems to me that they would get jumbled up on the server if not properly flagged and organized as the data comes in. one in  one out, seems very clean to me and preferable honestly.  The use of strings may not even be needed here as well, I just thought it would be better than using int values and converting, when i can just pass them as strings to begin with.  Either way, I still need to implement some method of breaking out the values sent to the server from the client and the substr doesnt want to work with the char array.p  pI am also incredibly unfamiliar with anything networking and this is my first attempt at it from some tutorials i have seen.  I had a 30 min lecture on the subject, with no further explanation other than it works.  That being said please be constructive in your responses.

Negative 42953 pThis question is a following from another question I asked  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8788861passingclientdatatoservertocreateexcelorcsvfilePassing client data to server to create Excel or CSV Filea.p  pI have a client page which builds a JSON object to send to the server, and I have server code which can parse that JSON object into an SQL command and end up with a dataset of required data.p  pI had originally been passing the JSON object to an .asmx web service which would return a JSON object containing my data. Now I want to go in a different direction and have the data returned as a .csv file.p  pI understand I can try to put my JSON object into a query string and call my .ashx page, but the JSON object could get large, so Im trying to use the Request.Form of a POST.p  pMy question, and lack of understanding, is in how to use jQuery to post to the .ashx page and have it return the .csv file to the client. If I navigate to the .ashx page directly and modify the page to hard code the passed data, I get the .csv file returned to me no problem i.e I get the prompt to opensave the file. If I make a POST to the .ashx file from jQuery and send my JSON object through, I get a response which contains the data in a string, rather than getting a .csv.p  pSo, is there something I am missing, or am I just trying to achieve something that I cant or shouldnt be doingp  pId thought about passing my JSON object to a .asmx web service which would store the JSON object into a database and return an ID, and then use window.location to browse to the .ashx with the ID as a query string parameter to then generate the .csv file, but I thought there might be a way to avoid that middle step and do it with the POST.p  pSorry if this is a little rambling and disjointed. Ill be happy to clarify on any parts that may not make sense to anyone.p

Negative 42953 pSo Im thinking about creating a simple component that I would be using on various different projects. The component provides a class lets say, a car, that I use on many projects. The component also has things such as basic views for listing the various cars and persists its own data into a database via Entity Framework.p  pNow my question is, how do I extend this car component between projects Most cars in the different projects have very similar properties, but they all have some extra ones. So how do I add this extra functionality or just properties to the component in a way that allows me to just update the .dll containing the component should I later on improve the base component And how do I make the component aware of the extra columns in its dbp  pSo far Ive been considering two different alternatives, but dont like either. First would be to just take the latest version of the component, add the stuff that the current project needs and use that. But this obviously gets cumbersome if I want to update the base component. The second alternative I thought about would be that the main component has a link to an extension table that could then be defined further in the customizing project. Or something along those lines.p  pAs you can probably tell, Ive quite new to all this. So any and all tips are much appreciatedp

Negative 42953 pI have been looking at protobufnet recently and protocol buffers and so far it seems quite impressive.  What i am wondering about is the service side of things.  If i have understood the google documentation right you can declare services in the .proto files.

Negative 42953 pEDIT I decided to see if there was a problem with my new dll that caused it not to work at all.  I created a C app and added my dll as a reference.  When I did this it worked fine.  So it appears there is a problem with how it interacts with my test application.p  pI am working on a project that involves a number of dlls that are thirdparty and I do not have the source code for them.  My basic situation is that one of these dlls occasionally calls a function in a dll that I do have the source code for.  My dll is written in C.  However I am currently interested in replacing that dll with one written in native c as I need to make use of a large c library and my needs are not tied to the .NET framework, C was simply the language of the original source code I was given.  So I was wondering what the best way of doing this was.p  pHere is a snippet of my dll showing show it is defined leaving out a number of the methodsp  precodenamespace UserIDA      [Guid76F452FF7A8911d48A2C00B0D023C6A0]     [InterfaceTypeComInterfaceType.InterfaceIsIUnknown]     public unsafe interface IUserIDA              [DispId1]         void GetSwitchCriteriaref double intensity, ref double minMass,         ref double maxMass, ref bool selectIntensity, ref long numOfDepCycles        [Guid5B2DBDD4B763428aB48F2E148138E7A4] [ClassInterfaceClassInterfaceType.None] [ProgIdUserIDA.UserIDAObject] public unsafe class UserIDAObject  IUserIDA      const long SOK  0     const long SFALSE  1      public UserIDAObject                UserIDAObject                public void GetSwitchCriteriaref double intensity, ref double minMass, ref double maxMass, ref bool selectIntensity, ref long numOfDepCycles            codepre  pCan I create an unmanaged dll with the same progid and uuids or should I create a standard c dll and create a managed wrapperp  pstrongEditstrong So I have attempted to do this using ATL but have run across a problem.  I implemented the interface.  When I run a test application I used to test my original dll and try to call some of the methods I end up generating an exception right now all the methods are empty, it is just a skeleton.  If I call the OnInitIDA and OnScreenSurveyScan methods that have no input parameters I get an HRESULT of 0.  However in some cases I do not get this.  For instance, GetChargeStateParam does not seem to work.  I have to wonder if there is something inconsistent or incorrect in the definitions I added to the interface.p  pThese are the methods I added to the new dll.  they should match the interface posted abovep  precodeSTDMETHODGetSwitchCriteriaDOUBLE intensity, DOUBLE minMass, DOUBLE maxMass, BOOL selectIntensity, LONG numOfDepCycles STDMETHODGetChargeStateParamSHORT minCharge, SHORT maxCharge, BOOL doChargeState STDMETHODGetInclusionListDOUBLE intensity, DOUBLE theList, SHORT numOfItems STDMETHODGetExclusionListLONG exRTWindow, DOUBLE theMassList, LONG theRTList, SHORT numOfItems STDMETHODGetOtherCriteriaLONG smartFilterTime, DOUBLE isoExclusionWin, DOUBLE massTolerance, BOOL isPPM STDMETHODGetIsotopeMatchParamDOUBLE theMassList, DOUBLE theAbundanceList, DOUBLE abTolerance, DOUBLE maTolerance STDMETHODOnInitIDAvoid STDMETHODOnScreenSurveySpecvoid STDMETHODOnPrepareNextScanDOUBLE selectedMasses, DOUBLE selectedIntensities, LONG selectedCharges, LONG itemCount codepre  pI just realized I forgot to include the original interface from the C project so that comparisons can be made.

But once the message is sent, the io service thread on the sender side goes into busywait loop. truss on the sender pid shows the following calls continuously. p  precode6     recvmsg57, 0xFFFFFD7FEB9FDDF0, 0              Err11 EAGAIN  6     write13,  900019000, 8                 8  6     ioctl13, DPPOLL, 0xFFFFFD7FEB9FE460           1  6     recvmsg57, 0xFFFFFD7FEB9FDDF0, 0              Err11 EAGAIN  6     write13,  900019000, 8                 8  6     ioctl13, DPPOLL, 0xFFFFFD7FEB9FE460           1  6     recvmsg57, 0xFFFFFD7FEB9FDDF0, 0              Err11 EAGAIN  6     write13,  900019000, 8                 8  6     ioctl13, DPPOLL, 0xFFFFFD7FEB9FE460           1  6     recvmsg57, 0xFFFFFD7FEB9FDDF0, 0              Err11 EAGAIN  6     write13,  900019000, 8                 8  6     ioctl13, DPPOLL, 0xFFFFFD7FEB9FE460           1  6     recvmsg57, 0xFFFFFD7FEB9FDDF0, 0              Err11 EAGAIN  6     write13,  900019000, 8                 8  6     ioctl13, DPPOLL, 0xFFFFFD7FEB9FE460           1  codepre  plsof shows that the socket descriptor 57 above is the socket descriptor connected to the receiver. p  pThread 6 here is the ioservice thread whose stack trace is  p  precodethread t6                      threadproxy                boostdetailthreaddataltgtrun                destunnelServiceSchedulerprocessServiceWork                boostasioioservicerun                boostasiodetailtaskioservicerun                boostasiodetailtaskioservicedoone                boostasiodetaildevpollreactorrun  codepre  pThe busywait loop continues until we stop the receiver.  Also, as mentioned, the issue is always reproducible if the size of the message more than 65536 216 bytes and sender and receiver are running on 2 different Solaris hosts. If both sender and receiver are running on same Solaris host then the issue is always reproducible with size 131067 217. p  pCan someone throw some light on why the ioservice thread here is continuously trying to read from the receiver though it has successfully sent the message and receiver is not actually writing anything on the socket.

Negative 42953 pIm authoring a jQuery plugin in which one of the methods that Id like to write will not take a selector argument and does not need to pass an element.

Negative 42953 pIve been using the MVVM pattern for a little while now and frequently run into a scenario where the value of one property depends on the value of another property. For instance, I have a control with a height and width, and I want to display the height and width on the control as a formatted string, height x width. So I include the following properties in my view modelp  precodepublic class FooViewModel  INotifyPropertyChanged       . . .      private double width     public double Width              get  return width          set                      ifwidth  value                              width  value                 NotifyPropertyChangedWidth                 NotifyPropertyChangedDisplayString  I had to remember to                                                          do this.                                 public string DisplayString              get                      return string.Format0 x 1, width, height                     . . .  codepre  pThen I bind to content of my codeLabelcode to the DisplayString property, which seems a lot more convenient than using a codeIMultiValueConvertercode to convert from the Width and Height properties. The inconvenient part is that anywhere I need to NotifyPropertyChanged for Width or Height, I also have to remember to notify for DisplayString. I can think of myriad ways to automate this, to varying degrees, but my question is whether there is a standard practice that people generally use to do this under MVVM in codeWPFcodep

Negative 42953 pSo, Im trying to make a game in XNA, and Im applying a pixel shader to my level so I can add effects to the gameplay screen. The shader itself is working nicely, but it has one flaw that really pushes back performance. As long as the shader is active, anything I draw to the screen acts as though it was drawn with its alpha channel at the maximum. Im drawing a lot of things using XNAs built in codeColorcode class, and much of it has varying alpha. However, the shader seems to ignore all of this. This occurs even if I just return the source from the shader.p  pIve seen a few possible solutions. The first of these was to draw to a RenderTarget2D and, while this did solve this issue, it caused more serious problems with alpha that I dont even want to go into.p  pI have seen a few people claim that multiplying the colours by the alpha value in the shader seems to help, but that made absolutely no difference, which suggests to me that the alpha value input is always being read as 1.p  pHere are some images to illustrate my problemp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comsgZqy.png altThis is the result with the shader activeimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comUCkKD.png altThis is what its supposed to look likep  pHopefully, someone knows how to resolve this.p

Negative 42953 pIn the grid world case study foe my final project I am making a game. In the game if the player clicks the W key the shiftUp method is called which makes all of the other actors of a certain instance move down to create the illusion of the player moving. This isnt a finished implementation of the method but this should get all the actors in the grid and test if they are an instance of a class called Enemy which extends Actor. If so the actor should move up one space. When I call this method a NullPointerException is called on the line that calls enemy.moveTo... This shouldnt happen because I check to see if its null.

Negative 42953 pIm trying to test a WCF service without creating a WCF client.  I have similar codeissues as presented a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma16430251397017herea.p  pI want full control on the SOAP payload so I want to be able to issue my own web requestsresponses and substitute my own XML as the parameters into any method.  I also want the return SOAP XML exactly as is, without creating response objects, fault exception objects, etc.p  pAs a point of reference, I want to do exactly what a hrefhttpwww.soapui.org relnofollowSoapUIa is doing at the point you click the execute button and get the response back. Im only assuming that SoapUI is NOT creating a WCF client, building the request and calling the method, but rather issuing a full SOAP call to the WCF service and displaying the result. p  pIn answer to the questions in the comments, the reason I dont want to create a WCF client is that I want to be insulated from any and all changes to the service, not have to rebuild references, modify my own code, create separate code for every new servicemethod, etc. because this process is kicked off automatically after every build, with no interaction.  p  pSo, I have hundreds of thousands of test XML parameters that I pass into hundreds of methods, without caring about what they are.  We have done it for years on ASMX web services and the one method very similar to the above link handled all web servicesmethodstest parameters.  p  pWith switching to WCF I get internal server errors especially when testing invalid XML nodes missing required nodes, errors in a create method for duplicate names, etc. any error condition. I think it makes sense that there is an easy way to do this with WCF in the same manner.  p  pI want EXACTLY what SoapUI is sending back, I just need to know how its doing it.p

Negative 42953 pIs there a way to operate on an object in codeRcode in parallel I understand that codemclapplycode in codeparallelcode fork processes and copy the workspace contents to each process. I would instead like instead to have my cores perform independent jobs on an object, without having to split and combine results. A use case would be changing all codenumericcode columns in a data.frame to codefactorcode columns in parallel. Another use case would be binning factors in a data.frame that have a large number of levels. The main reasons I am trying to do this are 1 to avoid running out of memory and 2 to increase speed.p  pBelow, object codebcode is the result of splitting columns in the data.frame codeacode and then combining them after applying codefactorcode. Instead, I would like to operate directly on the object codeacode. In serial, I am able to convert the columns in codeacode to codefactorcode types as a sideeffect of the codeforeach...docode loop. In parallel, I am unable to convert the columns of codeacode to codefactorcode types as a side effect, because as I understand it inside the codeforeach...doparcode, codeacode refers to an object that is local to each spawned process. p  pIs there a package in codeRcode that will let me do this p  precodea lt data.framebc1,1,2,2, cc2,2,3,3 stra  gt stra data.frame   4 obs. of  2 variables   b num  1 1 2 2   c num  2 2 3 3  serial b lt   foreach i  iter1ncola, .combine  data.frame do      a[,i] lt factora[,i]    stra strb  gt stra data.frame   4 obs. of  2 variables   b Factor w 2 levels 1,2 1 1 2 2   c Factor w 2 levels 2,3 1 1 2 2 gt strb data.frame   4 obs. of  2 variables   result.1 Factor w 2 levels 1,2 1 1 2 2   result.2 Factor w 2 levels 2,3 1 1 2 2  parallel a lt data.framebc1,1,2,2, cc2,2,3,3 b lt   foreach i  iter1ncola, .combine  data.frame dopar      a[,i] lt factora[,i]    stra strb  gt stra data.frame   4 obs. of  2 variables   b num  1 1 2 2   c num  2 2 3 3 gt strb data.frame   4 obs. of  2 variables   result.1 Factor w 2 levels 1,2 1 1 2 2   result.2 Factor w 2 levels 2,3 1 1 2 2 codepre

Negative 42953 pCurrently Im building a few mobile apps currently on iOS but later on Androidthat retrieve information via ajax calls returning JSON from a Ruby on Rails application. This obviously applies to other applications as well that are using another source to return the JSON data.p  pThe main question is WHEN to store the data and when to just use ajax calls to retrieve it. Currently, my apps do not store a single thing locally and instead require ajax calls for all data. I think for this example we can use the Twitter mobile app, which is one a lot of people are familiar with and has a lot of functionality that Im wondering how they do it more logically than technically. p  pQuestionsp  pstrong1strong When you log in the first thing you see is a list of all of the items in your stream. That list is available offline. Does that mean that when you originally signed in, Twitter already went and pulled all of your last X 100 stream items into a local database and then future views just pull it from therep  pstrong2strong If you then put your phone on airplane mode or just shut off mobile data and click one of those tweets, it opens up the tweet page with all of that data. So now, it looks like they arent pulling that information in via individually each time you visit a tweet page which is what my app currently does and takes some time to load that data in and create the views. Does it make sense that they are probably just using the same information that they pulled in when creating your stream itemsp  pstrong3strong Users. Is it better practice to when viewing a users profile page for example store a users data locally and then refresh on future visits, or just do pull in all of the data via ajax each time In theory each requires an ajax call...p  pI think those are my main questions for now. If anyone has any thoughts on any of those things or any other insights into mobile storage that would be great If anyone needs screenshots of anything I referenced please let me know and Id be happy to get those for you.p  pCurrently usingp  pTitanium Appcelerator for iOSbr Ruby on Rails for Backend and remote storagep
Negative 42953 pIm pretty excited about using Netty in the project Im working on, but under a lot of pressure to come up to speed quickly.  Im an experienced Java programmer but dont have much experience in writing clientserver systems.p  pIm working thru the netty examples, but find that there is not much documentation on how to properly run them.  Admittedly, it is useful digging thru the source code, but Ive hit the wall with that approach when I got to the HttpStaticFileServer.  The client request presumably is from telnet, but I have no idea what the format is for the file request itself and I have tried a few.  The Handler codec doesnt make it at all clear.  So in general, it would be nice if there is a set of instructions on how to run the example.  I promise I will be watching the entire process in the debugger, so I can follow what exactly is going on.  So for the moment, at least, I would appreciate a simple example for the FileServer.  The application I want to build will be built from that I suspect.  Thanks for the help    p

Negative 42953 pMy question originates from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6011747isthereanearconsensusguidelineforloglevelsthisa question, where one of the comments suggests that a DEBUG log level is finer grained than TRACE. Looking at what TRACE and DEBUG means in .NET, this seems to make sense, since, by definition, DEBUG as a concept is never seen in production. This is probably why they arent used as an event type in the Enterprise Library. On the other hand, all other implementations that I know of log4net, nlog, common.logging has TRACE as a finer level than DEBUG. That is, an application running at DEBUG log level would not write TRACE logs.p  pWe need to implement our own log framework and I was wondering if there are more people out there that thinks that DEBUG really should be the most spammy log level Or would you consider this a mistake if our new framework should provide some easytouse familiarity to new developers etcp  pThanks.p

Negative 42953 pWe have a website that was recently updated from ASP.NET 2 on IIS6 to .Net 4 on IIS7.5. When we deployed to the new Production server, we started getting http 404 errors after people logged in.  I.e. users could see the default login page, but once authenticated the website would crash.  As the URL had been modified to include the eurl.axd components we thought maybe it was something to do with ASP.NET v4 as per everyone elses issues with this error.  Except everyone having this issue is working with MVC whereas this website is MVP.p  pSo we rolled the code back to the old server while I looked into it.  Now Ive got them to redeploy the same code to the Production server again, but had them point the test domain to it for testing purposes.  The website is working just fine.p  pSo the only difference is that when accessed via http, the website works fine.  But if you assign it a https URL, then the postauthentication redirect crashes.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 42953 pI am asking if it is possible to host a Microsoft Access form inside a .Net form.p  pNo I havent gone mad, we are maintaining a massive system written entirely in VBA by somebody who didnt know a lot of VBA attempting to use Microsoft Access as an IDE. Its basically thousands of lines of spaghetti code and while we would love to scrap it and start from scratch, this is not an option.p  pWe are therefore trying to improve what is there, and in this particular scenario it would be really helpful if we could somehow host the Microsoft Access forms inside a .Net Windows Form as we can interact with the proprietary hardware from .Net much more effectively than we can from VB6.p  pWe currently have a .Net application that runs on the computer alongside the many MSAccess databases that the users have open at any one time, and the .Net application interacts with these using MS Access Interop with varying degrees of success. This is because it uses form titles and filenameslocations to get a handle on the database to do what it needs to do, and also relies on the user not interferingswitching off the applicationmoving the databases to their desktops etc. Its a bit of a mess.p  pTherefore, I am asking if it is possible to somehow host a Microsoft Access form inside a .Net Windows form, by maybe adding the form itself as a control or a subform, in a way that would give me direct access to all of the controls on the form from .Netp

Negative 42953 pIve created my own transition animation between views.  I animate two properties, the position and the transform, to provide a cubelike transition between views. The frame uses codeCABasicAnimationcode while the transform uses a 2stage codeCAKeyframeAnimationcode. Everything works fine except for one small detail I cant seem to figure out.  In my transition I apply a codeCATransform3DScalecode on the middle key frame to create a zoominzoomout effect.  That works fine except the animation looks slightly jerky.  Its animating the between the key frames in a linear fashion, and I would like to smooth that out.  Now codeCAKeyframeAnimationcode has a way to do that using codecalculationModecode, but it doesnt seem to work for transforms.

Negative 42953 pThis question focuses on finding a perfect solution for an asynchronous image resizing process guided by a cron job  job queue.p  pemImages are getting uploaded and saved in the original size on the server. The resize process picks them up, resizes and saves them in two new sizes. For this job I use Imagemagick with the following setup [nice n 19 convert density 500  . fullpath .  resample  . dpi .   . destFolder . d.jpg]. nice will not prevent a command from using 100 CPU. What it does do is say that if any other process needs CPU, it will get a higher priority than the nice processes. As you see this is just some improvement  because I am sure if users will upload pictures simulataneously the server will definitely crash.emp  pstrongMy intention is to process all images through the server and not locally via Flash or Java. So if I cant get more server CPU amp RAM, I think I need to implement an asynchronous resize job queue through a cron job which gets offered a limited CPU amp Memory usage. While an image is processed, the user gets a thumbnail with the info, your image will be soon available, to stop him from uploading the same image again. Thats my basic idea at the moment.strongp  pI work with a PHP framework on a Debian Linux server for this web application. Any help, guiding tips or information resources for such a cron jobjob queueimplementation ideas are highly appreciatedp  pMany thanks in advancep  pCheersp  pThommyp

Negative 42953 pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pI am developing a web application, similar to trello, in which a page is seperated up into columns and taskscards can be added to each column, or drag and dropped between them.p  pThis will be primarily desktop based and have a lot more functionality such as a left hand information column, and the ability to create custom layouts by adding more columns and changing styles and the likes.p  pNormally i would build this in HTML and CSS with JQuery for the functionality.p  pstrongProblemQuestionstrongp  pAlthough it is primarily desktop use, we are also aware that it is likely to be used on tablet devices such as the iPad, or the surface. Also with Windows 8 out soon some desktops will start to have more touch interfaces which we would want to cater for.p  pMy question is, would it be sensible to build this using jQuery Mobile as opposed to jQuery itself as i have heard that standard jQuery is not really set up to handle touchscreen interaction that well. On the otherhand from what i have seen of jQuery mobile it seems to be very focused on the Layout and Style which would probably be very custom for this.p  pDont want to use jQuery Mobile and end up having to remove, overwrite or bodge styling and functionality to get it to work as i want, but at the same time dont want to use jQuery Standard and it not work on tablets and touch devices.p  pDot worried about mobile necessarily as due to the screensize i would probably have to develop a mobile version specifically.p  pThanks Shaunp

My code compiles and runs fine but will only return a false, presumably because sum is staying at 1 it initializes at one since 1 is a divisor of every number. number is a private int brought in from the constructors and set statements.p  precode  public boolean isPerfect        int x  number 1      int div  0     int sum  1     whilexgt 1              ifnumber  x  0                      div   x             sum div                  x          ifsum  number              return true          else              return false         codepre
Negative 42953 pSo I am trying to use a recursive method to find a path between two people. Here is the quick background I define some facts codeinX,Ycode. That show who is related, ie. codeinperson1,project1code, codeinperson2,project1code, etc etc. Now any two people are related if they were in the same project as each other, or there is a linking path of people between them. For example p1 worked on A p2 worked on A and B and p3 worked on B therefore there is a path from p1 to p3 through p2. These paths can be any length.p  pI am trying to solve this recursively dont see any other way, but there is an annoying problemp  precoderelatedA,B          inA,X,         inB,X,         notAB.  chainA,B          relatedA,B. chainA,B          relatedA,Y,                chainY,B. codepre  pThe issue is that the path can repeat itself. It can go from p1 to p2 back to p1 endless times. A person should not be in the path more than 1 time.p  pI tried to fix this with a list that I add to. If a person is already in the list, they cant be added againp  precoderelatedA,B,L          inA,X,         inB,X,notAB.  chainA,B,L          relatedA,B,L. chainA,B,L          relatedA,Y,L,         notmemberY,L,         appendL,[Y],Q,         chainY,B,Q. codepre  pAnd it sort of worked, but caused a ton of random errors, repeating some people multiple times, some only once, and then failing. Does this approach look right Am I totally using lists wrongp  pThank You.p

So I say it should be injected as well.li listrongChasisstrong  This one takes more thought. Chassis is a very essential part of the car so getting it as an external dependency seems a little weird. However, you can certainly run tests on the Chasis alone and the Car could be tested with a dummy even though I am not sure whether it should. Should such an essential part of the object be injectedli listrongExhaustGasstrong  This one is even harder. I could inject a factory that creates IExhaustGas on demand but I am not sure whether I should.

Negative 42953 pHopefully someone can see what Im doing wrong, but heres the story...p  pMy current site URLs are autogenerated by the ecommerce software from the product and category names, therefore if the productcategory name includes a nonalphanumeric characer, this is encoded in the URL which is a pain.

It also converts to lowercase, which I have managed to find a htaccess solution for redirecting uppercase to lowercase. It also does not have the Shop part of the URL, which I have also managed to solve via htaccess. EGp  precodemysite.comfurnituresetlargetable4chairs.html codepre  pTo remove the Shop partp  precodeRedirectMatch 301 Shop. httpwww.mysite.com1 codepre  pTo replace uppercase with lowercase to prevent a 404 errorp  precodeRewriteCond REQUESTURI [AZ] RewriteCond REQUESTFILENAME .pnggificoswfjpgjpegjscssphppdf RewriteRule . lchttpwww.mysite.com1 [R301,L] codepre  pThese both work perfectly.p  pSo I need an htaccess rule, or possibly several, to remove these encoded characters from the URL.

Negative 42953 pWe are using SubSonic 2.1 to get information from our SQL database.

I have changed the call to the stored procedure so it does not use subsonic at all and it pulls the info back in the same 45 seconds.

Negative 42953 pI have the following codep  precodeint i  1 int j  0 switch i  case 1 j  i case 2 j  i case 3 j  i break  printfd d,i, j codepre  pThe codeicode expression evaluates codeicode to 1 since its a postincrement operator, so the statements in case 1 will be executed, which means codejcode is evaluated to 2. Then without breaks, the program continues to execute all the following statements. Since the value of codeicode does not change, the value of codejcode doesnt either. So I expect the output to be something like code2 2code but it turned out to be code2 6code. Can anyone give me an explanation please, thanksp

Negative 42953 ol lipI have two UI threads, one is the main thread and the other is a background thread whose ApartmentState is STA. Each thread creates its own window and the background window has a Cancel button on it.pli lipThe main thread has a function which is busy and needs quite a long time to finish. I hope once the Cancel button is clicked, the main thread should stop the timeconsuming function.pli lipBelow is the pseudocode in main threadp  pfor... p  precode  Option A Application.DoEvents    Option B Dispatcher.Invoke to update UI in background thread   ifcancel         return  Stop the timeconsuming function   else          DoSomething codepre  ppli ol  pThe strange thing is that the click event on Cancel button is NOT captured or handled by the background thread. IMO, each thread has its own message queue, and when I click the Cancel button, this message should be queued and processed by the background thread immediately, but according to my test locally, this is not true, the background thread never handles the button click event...p  pAny thoughtsp  pBTW, I think there are two ways to overcome the above issue, one is to use Application.DoEvents, and the other is to leverage Dispatcher.Invoke. But Im still curious why the background thread can NOT handle the message immediately. Thanks in advance.p

Negative 42953 pI am trying to create an inventory system.  This inventory system is based off of bar codes that are MAC addresses 12 character, hexadecimal.  So on one page, I ask for the model number and how many the user wants to add, this can be anywhere from 2 to 100, based on what they enter there, they are presented with the appropriate number of MAC address fields on the next page.

Negative 42953 pBasically, I wouldnt find this anywhere. All I really need is date last executed, or even date last shutdown that is, exe ended execution. I dont even need a catalog of all runsshutdowns, just the last one.p  pIm sure they must keep it somewhere. Reason being, in control panel Win Vista when you go to programs amp features you have the option to sort the programs by how often they are used which is runexecuted since this will not be based on last accessed time. Then, in their description, they quote usage frequency with terms such as rarely, sometimes, often, regularly etc...p  pNow in Win7, if you right click on the columns amp select more... from the installed programs listing control, youll see a Last Used On option This implies that last used date is at least kept somewhere in Win7.p  pAny ideas anyonep  pemUpdate About LastAccess DateTimeem LastAccess is too unreliable it seems correct me if im wrong it keeps on changing as soon as something such as windows accesses it. Maybe i should ask, does windows mess this field up by accessing the file to read info out of it such as file sizedates etc especially when browsing folders or does windows access files secretly to prevent contaminating the last access dates p

Negative 42953 pIm working on one of my Android projects, trying to lessen the code inside my Activities. In one of them, I have CustomView which just extends LinearLayout that opens a DialogFrament when clicked. Now, the way I implement this is by overriding codeonTouchcode in the activity and subsequently opening the DialogFrament from there. It looks something like thisp  precodeOverride public boolean onTouchView v, MotionEvent event      if event.getAction  MotionEvent.ACTIONUP          if v.getId  mCustomView.Id              mDialogFragment.showmFragmentManager,  codepre  pId like to move the process of opening the DialogFragment away from the activity and into the CustomView itself, but, the problem I have is that I cant get an instance of FragmentManager by using codegetSupportFragmentManagercode in the CustomView.

Sort of a wishlist, but certain users have 2000 itens on itp  pThe items are products which are sold on the website. These items have different features and prices, and theres a sidebar where you can filter your list. The prices depend on a lot of things, such as the users utm sourcemediumcampaign, the salespromotions that are currently going on, etc, and are calculated on the fly.p  pOn top of that, you can filter by price ranges, and we have a small number right to each filter indicating the quantity of items that belong to it. p  pExamplep  pcode200  400 130code  There are 130 items in this price rangep  hr  pIts currently working, but the page can be very slow if the user has too many items, since I have to filter and count them all, and calculate their prices. After the 2nd request, its all very fast due to caching, but some users have already experienced timeouts when loading for the first time, which is a bad thing.p  hr  h2What have I triedh2  pThe page itself has 3 user controlsp  ol liOne is the list menu and etcli liOne is the sidebarli liOne is the product listli ol  pThe same information I need in the list menu, I need in the sidebar, and I also need in the product list. Ive decided to load the first page of the product list synchronously, and load the sidebar and the menu after that. The menu has the total count of items wished and bought.p  pI can successfully load the remaining information through an UpdatePanel and a Timer. The timer fires at a relatively fast interval, and gets about 100 items. It updates the current state in a HiddenField, which I use in the next request to get the next 100 items, until I get all items, and stop the Timer. p  pHowever... when I press F5 and load it again, it makes requests in the same frequency, because the Timer is still there. But as the information is already cached, I wouldnt even need the timer at all.p  pstrongIm looking for a solution that could tell the server to load all records, but serve the page before that... and then the client would poll the server each 2 or 3 seconds, and check what records have been loaded already, and update the sidebar and the menu list accordingly.strongp  pIs there any way to do that Ive checked articles about Async Handlers, SignalR, Comet, but Im still clueless...p

Negative 42953 p UPDATE p  pIt truly seems that Google has just screwed every single person on the planet by absolutely requiring user interaction to upload a video. Of course I know, they are free. Exactly what I warned the client years ago about, so I dont need to be reminded. Thank You.p  pSo I would like to try to take this in a different direction and just find a loophole and a workaround to still keep doing what we are doing in spite of Googles complete lack of support or caring in any way about the developers and what they have to deal with.p  pIt would be different if you can actually call a phone number and talk to a human being about YouTube Partner access, but you can more quickly get access to the Illuminati.p  pOAuth 2.0 is now the only supported authentication method period. It does require user interaction.p  pBut what about that token Does anybody know how long the token lastsp  pIf I can obtain a token just once using user interaction and place it in the database, I can automate possibly hundreds or thousands of interactions afterwards.p  pIn other words, Im trying to turn the user interaction into a speed bump instead of a concrete wall.p  pIf anybody has any examples of obtaining that token, caching it, and using it afterwards, that would be a godsend to me right now. p  pThanks for the comments and the help.

Negative 42953 pI accidentally ran into what appears to be a very strange bug in Safaris javascript engine on iPad.p  pThe unsigned shift operator  is supposed to bitwise rightshift a number.

Its just to demonstrate the problem, if you omit the  0 it doesnt show up. In my actual situation there were different numbers and more complex expressions involved, but the same thing happened everything works until a number of iterations, then something breaks and variables suddenly become and remain zero, even after subsequent calculations that really ought to make them nonzero.p  pWorks fine on Android and PC browsers.

Negative 42953 pMy company is evaluating different bug tracking tools to replace our current system.  What weve got now is pretty much homegrown and it fits our needs pretty well.  Unfortunately it also has a boatload of problems and the time has come to get rid of it.  One of our requirements is that we have a way to assign a single bug to multiple projects but track the status independently for each one.p  pFor example, we produce both software and hardware, and several pieces of software are shared across different hardware projects.  If weve got a bug in a low level driver, it obviously needs to be assigned to the team developing the driver.  It also needs to go to each productspecific team that uses the driver.  The bug gets closed for the driver team as soon as they fix it, but then it only gets closed for the product teams once theyve incorporated the change and pushed an update package out to a website or whatever.p  pWith our current system, there is one shared bug report.  Its got individual fields for every team weve got and the status is set appropriately for each one.  There can be multiple people assigned to it, so theres usually one person from each team on it.  Beside the fact that its annoying to have so many fields to fumble through, its also a pain when people from different teams add comments to it because it can turn into a jumble of different conversations.  Now were also considering moving to Scrum or Kanban, which I think means each team needs to have their own report that they can easily move from state to state.  In my mind, that means the best solution is one where theres some kind of master bug record that QA can use to see everything thats going on, but then have individual records for each team that are automatically tied back to the master one.p  pSome people here are trying to figure out if thats possible in JIRA, but Im also wondering about Hansoft.  Ive used JIRA and like it, but Hansoft looks really sweet as well.  Is it possible to achieve what Im after in Hansoft  How about JIRAp

That is, I thought, when you return a function, are you just returning the source code for that function, no Until its evaluated So I tested this theory by trying out a slightly different version of bindp  precodefunction mybind2f, o      var arguments  6     return function            Otherwise, bind it like this         return f.applyo, arguments       codepre  pIf its simply returning tbe unevaluated function source, theres no way that it stores codearguments  6code when later evaluated, right And after checking, I still got codeg2code  3. But then I realized  if its just returning unevaluated code, how is the codeocode in codereturn f.applyo, argumentscode getting passedp  pSo I decided that what must be happening is thisp  pThe codeocode and the codeargumentscode variables even when codeargumentscode equals 6 emareem getting passed on to the function. Its just that when the function codegcode is eventually called, the codeargumentscode variable is redefined by the interpreter to be the arguments of codegcode in codeg2code and hence the original value of arguments that I tried to pass on was replaced. But this implies that it was sort of storing the function as text up until then, because otherwise codeocode and codeargumentscode would have simply been data in the program, rather than variables that could be overwritten. Is this explanation correctp  pstrongQuestion 2strong Earlier on the same page, he defines the following function which makes use the codeapplycode method to trace a function for debuggingp  precodefunction traceo, m      var original  o[m]   Remember original method in the closure.     o[m]  function     Now define the new method.         console.lognew Date, Entering, m       Log message.         var result  original.applythis, arguments  Invoke original.         console.lognew Date, Exiting, m        Log message.         return result                                 Return result.       codepre  pWouldnt the codethiscode here refer to the function that were defining, rather than the object codeocode Or are those two things one and the samep

Negative 42953 pI need to do something that can only be processed on server side and not by just using javascript on the html page. Im already using this process for my other aspx pages. However, this time I need to make this work on an html page.p  pThe workaround that I have done so far is to have an iframe somewhere in my html page that points to an aspx page. I do the process on its code behind and save what I need on a hidden field in the iframe. I can now get that value from the iframe and use it on my html page.p  pIt works but Im thinking that there might be a simpler approach in doing this without having to create a new aspx page just for processing. Is there another way to accomplish thisp  pUPDATE To be specific, I need to get the locationcountry of the user on page load in order to change the css accordingly. I know there are a lot of sites that I can connect to on my page to do this but I dont know which one is secured. Also, we already have our own method to this for our aspx pages so I want to use that instead. Hope this update helps.p

Negative 42953 pI am trying to decide on a reporting service to use and so far I have the general feel that many people believe that SSRS is gaining ground on Crystal if it has not already surpassed it. From what Ive researched, it seems that looking forward SSRS would be the best choice but one major flawweakness that it has opposed to CR is that when it comes to printing the reports CR is much more accurate and userfriendly than SSRS. The reason being is that in order to present most of these reports they must be in either a .pdf or paper format so this would be a major hiccup in regards to choosing SSRS.p  pWould anyone that has experience with this issue from either the CR or SSRS side have any advice or opinions on thisp

Negative 42953 pI have a new action that shows a form with most of my User models attributes, with the exception of some checkboxes schools and roles through join tables. If some presence validation fails I am redirected back to the new action with the pre filled values. Except since the User model does not have those extra checkbox parameters it just remains empty.

It seems a redirect happens and not a render, so I cannot access the codeparams[schoolid]code or codeparams[roleid]code arrays of checked values by the user before the error.

Negative 42953 pI need to update each cell with a tag id. I have completed this, but there is one crucial flaw. When I change the order of the cells, the cells will inherit the wrong id.For example,if I swap cell 2 for cell 1 , cell 1 will get cell 2 id and cell 2 will get cell 1 id. Each ID needs to be for a specific cell and one cell only so that way if I changed the order the cell it will contain its id. I believe the issue is I am calling id in my UICollectionView delegate and so that way every time it updates it call from the server and reuses the id again.

But I am confused on the implementation when it comes to reading separate sections of text within a line.p  pEach line in the file will have names first and last name separated by an empty space, but a comma is used to delimited the UKNOWN set of full names. A semicolon is then used to to separate the section within the line.

Negative 42953 pSomeone sent me some codeRcode code to read a codenetCDFcode file using the codeRcode package coderastercode, among others.  The code creates a series of code.tifcode files.  Unfortunately, I am not very familiar with coderastercode, code.tifcode files or codenetCDFcode files.  So, I have tried to alter the codeRcode code to also write code.csvcode files.

I am hoping someone may be able to verify that the data in both formats are the same.  Ideally, I would like to be able to open the code.tifcode files and conduct the verification myself.  How can I do thatp  pPerhaps a direct comparison is not possible if the code.tifcode files only contain an image instead of numbers.  In that case I would like to verify that the image in the code.tifcode files correspond to the data in the code.csvcode filesp  pBelow the codeRcode code are the contents of a code.csvcode file with a followup question about the column and row headings.p  precodesetwdcusersmark w millernetCDF  my.file lt my.netCDF.nc my.var1 lt my.variable  libraryncdf  libraryrgdal  librarychron  libraryfields   file    lt open.ncdfmy.file long    lt get.var.ncdffile, varidlon lat     lt get.var.ncdffile, varidlat time    lt get.var.ncdffile, varidtime my.varb lt get.var.ncdffile, varidmy.var1  netCDF to raster libraryraster  r       lt brickmy.file, varname  my.var1  Crop spatial coverage e       lt extent255,265,35,45 rc      lt cropr, e, bylayerTRUE  lat2    lt lat[  lat gt  35 amp lat  lt  45] long2   lt long[long gt 255 amp long lt 265]  list1   lt unstackrc rs      lt stacklist1  fori in 15      r2 lt 1i112      s2 lt 2i112      a2 lt rs[[r2]]      b2 lt rs[[s2]]      m2 lt stacka2,b2      my.var lt overlaym2, funfunctionx,y xy, unstackTRUE, recycleFALSE       f2 lt 1999i       writeRastermy.var, filenamepastemy.var, f2, .tif, formatGTiff       my.var2 lt as.matrixmy.var, nrowlengthlat2, byrowTRUE       write.tablemy.var2, file  paste0my.var, f2, .csv, quote  FALSE, sep,, col.names  FALSE, row.names  FALSE  codepre  pHere are the rounded contents of one code.csvcode file p  precode1.0,0.9,0.8,0.8,0.7,0.7,0.8,0.8,1.0,1.0 1.0,0.8,0.6,0.5,0.4,0.5,0.7,0.9,1.0,1.0 1.0,0.7,0.5,0.4,0.3,0.4,0.7,1.0,1.0,1.0 0.0,0.5,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.6,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0 0.0,0.6,0.5,0.4,0.5,0.8,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0 1.0,0.7,0.6,0.5,0.6,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0 1.0,0.9,0.8,0.7,0.9,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0 1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0 2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0 1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0 codepre  pGiven thatp  precodelat2  [1] 44.5 43.5 42.5 41.5 40.5 39.5 38.5 37.5 36.5 35.5  long2  [1] 255.5 256.5 257.5 258.5 259.5 260.5 261.5 262.5 263.5 264.5 codepre  pCan I safely add the following column and row names to each code.csvcode filep  precode      255.5 256.5 257.5 258.5 259.5 260.5 261.5 262.5 263.5 264.5 44.5  1.0,0.9,0.8,0.8,0.7,0.7,0.8,0.8,1.0,1.0 43.5  1.0,0.8,0.6,0.5,0.4,0.5,0.7,0.9,1.0,1.0 42.5  1.0,0.7,0.5,0.4,0.3,0.4,0.7,1.0,1.0,1.0 41.5  0.0,0.5,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.6,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0 40.5  0.0,0.6,0.5,0.4,0.5,0.8,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0 39.5  1.0,0.7,0.6,0.5,0.6,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0 38.5  1.0,0.9,0.8,0.7,0.9,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0 37.5  1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0 36.5  2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0 35.5  1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0 codepre  pThank you for any advice.

It ran and finished without complaining, but, very oddly, it produced incorrect results on the GPU.  This code is supposed to return a number very close to one, but the final result from the GPU is 40.726689.  When I run the same code on the CPU using OpenCL or on other OpenCL systems, it returns 1.000000.p  pDoes anyone have any idea whats going on here  Am I missing something, or are there limitations to the OpenCL implementation or the graphics processor  My first thought was memory, but the example uses less than a megabyte, so it shouldnt be that.p  pEDITp  pMay have just answered my own question I switched the example to using single instead of double precision, and it returned correct results.  Can someone confirm the HD 4000 supports single, but not double precision  Also, why wouldnt the compiler complain if double precision isnt supportedp

I would then scan in words line by line from the text file, match the string length 4, compare it with the user input etst and then output any word with the same letters in the array, resulting in the found word test.p  pAnother example Input emta, a  1, e  1, m  1, t  1, strlen  4, compare with wordlist, Outputs team, meat, mate, tame.p  pAny help is much appreciatedp
Negative 42953 pHi i have a mflow file that contains flow1 in which Vm inbound endpoint is kept.Through this vm endpoint i am connecting the other flow2 which is present in onother mflow file in the same project.An exception has been thrown in flow2 and i need to catch it in flow1. I can see the exception payload in flow1 which is coming from flow2.But flow1 is not recognizing it as an exception and passing to the other components of flow instead of sending it to catch block.help me in soving this issue.I need to catch it in main flow i.e flow1 only.   Parallel flow will be running along with this flow and i am aggregating both the responses.If one of the flow throws exception it shouldnt effect the execution of another parallel flow.p
Negative 42953 pIm in trouble with a C homework. Programs goal is to get some numbers from a text file about some buildings and by using those numbers calculating the outline of the city as corner points written in a text file, in first text file numbers are written by three tabseberated part, first number is start coordinate, second number is height of the building and third number is width of the building. For instance 24 7 6 means that corners of the building are 24,0, 24,7, 30,7, 30,0. I started to work on this program but had some problems so I decided to make it part by part, so in the following code, Im trying to get numbers from that text file, send them to a dynamic memory part and then print them on the screen. But when I run this code, it starts and stops with a system error and the error code is c0000005, which caused by fseek or rewind I guess, because when I delete these functions, program works improperly but does not give an error,  where is the problemp  pBuildings.txt is like thisp  pcode24 7 4 5 7 11 26 9 7 9 5 5 3 12 4 33 9 6 37 5 7 12 9 10 273 64 3codep  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt include ltstdlib.hgt  typedef struct building int start, height, width BUILDING  int main  FILE buildingsptr char karakter int satir0, i BUILDING ptr double sum buildingsptrfopenbuildings.txt,r  whilekarakterfgetcbuildingsptr  EOF      ifkaraktern satir                                                    ptrBUILDING mallocsatirsizeofBUILDING   printfdn, ftellbuildingsptr rewindbuildingsptr fseekbuildingsptr, 0L, SEEKSET printfdn, ftellbuildingsptr  fori0 iltsatir i     fscanfbuildingsptr, p p p, ptrgtstart, ptrgtheight, ptrgtwidth     ptr   printfd d d, ptrgtstart, ptrgtheight, ptrgtwidth   getch return 0       codepre

Negative 42953 pIm extracting instances of three elements from an XML file ComponentStr, keyID, and valueStr. Whenever I find a ComponentStr, I want to addassociate the keyIDvalueStr to it.

Negative 42953 pWhat is the difference or advantage of posting a complex object using codeJSON.stringifycode over simply allowing the default url encoding of the data, when using the codejQuery.ajaxcode functions The MVC WebApi I am posting to is able to correctly route and parse both requests, so there is no emexplicitem need to send JSON to the server. Additionally, because CORS is enabled on the server, posting json emits a preflight OPTIONS request I understand why...that is not my question, whereas using the default encoding does not, thus saving one network call which would emseemem to be advantageous from a performance standpoint.p  pBoth of these ajax calls work. Ive tested with an object that also contains an embedded subobject and an embedded arrayp  precodevar item       Name Joe,      Team Yankees,      Vitals  Age 21, Height 60 ,      Positions [1st, Right, DH]   using default urlencoding .postapiUri, item .donefunction  alertDone .failfunction  alertFail   posting a json string .ajax     url apiUri,     contentType applicationjson,     data JSON.stringifyitem,     type POST  .donefunction  alertDone .failfunction  alertFail codepre  pHowever, many ajax to webapi examples seem to favor posting data as a json string.p  pGuidelines or advicep
Negative 42953 pI have an Android app that uses ViewPager and FragmentStatePagerAdapter. I however need to add a new feature in which I have to know the swipe direction to move from one fragment view to another, left or right. i.e, when I swipe left, I would do one thing, and when I swipe right I would do something else.p  pPlease note, I do not need the events to happen AFTER the swipe is over. I have to do those events as the swipe occurs. I thought of using codesetOnPageChangeListenercode but it does not tell me swipe direction.

Negative 42953 pIm a newbie with JavaScript and I asked a question earlier and got answers which helped me, but I thought I could incorporate it into the larger form I was working with and now Im stuck again.p  pI have a large form with one select option. When the form is filled out, a new window opens and incorporates the values submitted into an invitation type page.p  pEverything else is working except for this select option. The problem I am having is depending on the selection, I want different text to be written into the new window as part of the overall new window invitation page.p  pIm really close, mostly bc of help I received earlier today  I can either get the new window to show just my named option value or I can get a whole new window with the different text that is not part of the invitation page. I just cant combine the two.p  pI wrote up a smaller page in case someone wants to take a look at it.

Negative 42953 pstrongEDIT I think I might have a roundabout way to deal with the issue.strongp  pstrongSince Im starting from the zpk representation, just split the higher order filter into two smaller order filters.strongp  pstrongFor example, instead of designing a filter with 5 poles and 5 zeros, design Filter A with three poles and three zeros and Filter B with two poles and two zeros. Then filter with Filter A and then filter with Filter B. This should be equivalent and I tested it at low sampling rates since at low sampling rates I dont see this issue seems to have positive results.strongp  pIm using the scipy.signal module to implement a filter where I designate 5 zeros all at 100Hz, and 5 poles all at 1Hz. Im looking at the frequency response of the digital filter and it doesnt look like the analog filter at low frequencies.p  pIve noticed that if I lower the sampling rate, then it matches pretty well eg. lowering from 16384Hz to 4096Hz. Or if I lower the order of the filter, then it matches better too.p  pCould someone explain how to match the analog and digital frequency responses betterp  pExample images below.p  p4096Hz black analog filter magnitude, blue digital filter magnitude notice some difference at low frequenciesp  pimg srchttpi.imgur.comlsbzhtV.png altx title4096Hz frequency responsep  p16384Hz the match a low frequencies is worsep  pimg srchttpi.imgur.compjtdm8q.png altx title16384Hz frequency responsep  pFor examplep  precodeimport numpy as np import scipy.signal import matplotlib.pyplot as plt   define zpk filter and sampling rate z  np.array[2np.pi100., 2np.pi100., 2np.pi100., 2np.pi100., 2np.pi100.], dtypenp.float64 p  np.array[2np.pi1., 2np.pi1., 2np.pi1., 2np.pi1., 2np.pi1.] k  1. 100.5 samplerate  16384   get analog coefficients analogcoefficients  scipy.signal.zpk2tfz, p, k   get digital coefficients digitalcoefficients  scipy.signal.bilinearanalogcoefficients[0], analogcoefficients[1], samplerate   get frequency response wa,ha  scipy.signal.freqsanalogcoefficients[0], analogcoefficients[1], 220 w,h  scipy.signal.freqzdigitalcoefficients[0], digitalcoefficients[1], 220 w  w  samplerate  2 np.pi wa  wa  2 np.pi    plot frequency response  blue   digital magnitude  black  analog magnitude fig  plt.figure plt.titleDigital filter frequency response ax1  fig.addsubplot111 plt.semilogxw, 20  np.log10absh, b plt.semilogxwa, 20  np.log10absha, k plt.ylabelmagnitude [dB] plt.xlabelfrequency [Hz] plt.grid plt.axistight plt.xlim[0.001, samplerate2] plt.show codepre  pThanks.p

Negative 42953 ppretty newbie question I think but Ive spent over 6 hours doing this one way and another and I dont know whats the best way doing it, so I am asking for your help about how it is suppost to be done.p  pI have 2 enums, for example car and bike. I have to make codelistcode or codearraycode I dont know which is better that has 2  1 000 000 elements inside and when its done I have to reorder the codelistcodecodearraycode bikes at the beginning and cars in the end. There are only a bike and a car, but there can be hundreds or thoulsands or even more of them. I dont know if its possible to make codeEnumMapcode about 2 enums.p  pcodeEnumMapcode has key and value, so I gave key car and value 0, and key bike value 1, so it would be easier to reorder, but I found out I cant do this on codeEnumMapcode, because doest matter how much elements I add, there is always only 2, bike and car. Cant talk about hundreds there I assume.p  pThe reason why I havent focused on array, is in the beginning of code there is codeenum garage bike, carcode  p  pThis is homework yes, but I just hope to find out the method for doing it spent hours just reading and trying different approaches, not that someone does it for me.p

Negative 42953 pstrongThe questionstrong How where can I specify the line terminator string of DAT file in case, that I pass the name of the DAT file on the command line using data parameter and not in CTL file I am using Oracle 11.2 SQL Loader. p  pstrongThe goalstrong I need to load fast huge amount of data from CSV file into Oracle 11.2 or above. The field column separator is hexa 1F US character  unit separator, the string delimiter is the double quote, the record row separator is hexa 1E RS character  record separator. p  pstrongThe problemstrong Using stream record format with str terminatorstring of SQL Loader is fine, but just only in case, that I can specify the name of the DAT file using infile directive inside CTL.

Negative 42953 pI guess this is a very basic question, but even after looking around on the internet for a while I cant seem to find a proper answer to this question. I will refer to this tutorial on stackheapa hrefhttpgribblelab.orgCBootcamp7MemoryStackvsHeap.html relnofollowhttpgribblelab.orgCBootcamp7MemoryStackvsHeap.htmlap  pLets say I write the following codep  precodevoid testVoid     int testVariable  5  codepre  pIf Im not wrong, this function should create a variable located on the stack. As the functions exits, the allocated memory on the stack is deleted  so my variable should also have been deleted by then.p  pI have learned that pointers in c point to the memory location of a variable. So if the variable pointed to by a pointer is located on the stack, and the stack then is cleared, I would expect not to be able to access original value through the pointer anymore, since the memory location pointed to is is cleared. However, I tested thisp  precodeint pointer  void testVoid      int num  3     pointer  ampnum  Here I get the memory location of my numvariable     cout ltlt pointer ltlt    ltlt pointer ltlt endl   I would get the same result if i printed ampnum   int mainint args, char argv       pointer  new int     testVoid     cout ltlt pointer ltlt    ltlt pointer ltlt endl   I can still access the memory of my numvariable      while true       return 0  codepre  pAfter exiting the testVoidfunction, where the variable is created, I can still get the value of the variable using my pointer. So obviously I have misunderstood something regarding how pointers work in c. Printing amppointer and ampnum gives me the same memory location, even after testVoid has finished. What is the reason for this If the memory pointed to by the pointer were moved to the heap, shouldnt coutltltampnum and coutlt  pAnd heres the output 0024F904  3 0024F904  3p

Negative 42953 pIve been searching for the past few days how to load an assembly in a separate app domain than the default one and I cant find an answer on how to do so. I will briefly explain the majority of things I have tried. p  ol lipI have used CreateInstanceFromAndUnwrap and this works....Mostly but there are 2 problems with this method. The first problem is that when I call codenewDomain.GetAssembliescode I get a FileNotFoundException and the only way to resolve this exception is to implement codeAppDomain.CurrentDomain.AssemblyResolvecode. The problem with this is that it loads the assembly into the default domain, meaning I cant unload the Assembly. The Second problem is that I have a base abstract class in the running assembly called Task and I have child classes in other assemblies that derive from Task. When I call  codevar obj  newDomain.CreateInstanceFromAndUnwrapparam1, param2code it returns me a MarshalByRefObject which it should but when I cast it to the abstract class  codevar obj  TasknewDomain.CreateInstanceFromAndUnwrapparam1, param2code, the type of obj is Task.  Now I know that its an instance of ChildTask but it says that the type is Task and I need the type to be ChildTask but I cant convert it to ChildTask without loading the assembly into the Default Domain. pli lipI have created a Proxy class that inherits from MarshalByRefObject and loaded the Assembly inside the Proxy class as many of the answers on this topic suggest but all it does is load the assembly into the default domain and not the created one. Therefore not allowing me to unload it once Im finished with it. pli lipI have used codenewDomain.DoCallbackCallbackMethodcode in order to load an assembly without my new appdomain. The problem is that once the method has finished executing, the changes done in the Callback method have no effect on the Default Domain for example p  precodepublic void DoSomething      newDomain.DoCallbackCallbackMethod     Type type  newDomain.GetDataTYPE  This returns null as if nothing happened in     CallbackMethod   public void CallbackMethod      newDomain.SetDataTYPE, newDomain.CreateInstanceFromAndUnwrapparam1,   param2.GetType   At this point TYPE will be set to ChildTask codepreli ol  pThis makes sense because they are in separate domains so changes in one domain shouldnt effect another domain. I dont know how to allow them to interact with each other so that I can get a set value from CallbackMethodp  ol start4 lipI have used codenewDomain.Loadcode even though its deprecated and I get a FileNotFoundException even while using AppDomainSetup pli lipI have tried using Serialization but I keep getting a bunch of serialization exceptions saying that a Type cant be resolved, etc and the only way to fix these exceptions is to using Assembly Resolve which loads the assembly into the Default Domain.pli ol  pIs there something Im missing All I really want to do is be able to load an assembly into a new appdomain and get a type from that assembly, but it seems that I cant load assemblies unless theyre loaded into the Default Domain. Is it possible to do this Or will I just have to find a workaroundp

Negative 42953 pI am looking in to automation. We have several environments at work that take several hours to install. For consistency purposes and speed I am trying to find a way to automate them. A few examples of what I am looking to automate SoapUI, Liferay, MySQL, Databases setup, Eclipse. p  pI cannot use mirroring tools because we handle a lot of personal information. Also, often times these environments are not fresh installs. Meaning that they have other projects on them that I cannot touch.p  pOne idea that I had that almost worked was using macro tools like AutoHotKey. I was able to write the script to configure and set up a lot of the tools via command line. The issue that I ran into was installation Wizards. It is unreliable to script a button click. The reasoning is due to positioning. Different resolutions, zoom levels, and dpi impact the reliability of the clicks. I was unable to find a command line way to install and set up SoapUI. The same problem occurred with MySQL Workbench. There were specific configurations I needed in the Wizard. I could not find a way to adjust them via command line. These are just examples.p  pIs there a way to set up suites that have all the correct configurations of different programs. The idea would be to host the files in a common folder. Someone who needs a specific suite could click an exe. The exe would pull the files and configure them on the users machine.p  pThanks for your helpp

Negative 42953 pIm working on developing a newsfeed where most cells have different heights from each other. So Im using Apples new builtin system to calculate the height of the rows dynamically in iOS8. p  pThe problem happens when I have to load a new page. When I do that, then scroll back towards the top, the content size of the table appears to be smaller than it should and the loading of the cells is really choppy. So when I start scrolling upwards, Ill be at the 5th cell and then all of the sudden the 4th cell will jump down. I attached the project if you guys want to see my code a hrefhttpsgithub.comKhanFuTableViewDynamicCellHeightPagination relnofollowhttpsgithub.comKhanFuTableViewDynamicCellHeightPaginationap  pIf you keep an eye when youre scrolling the table view, youll see it jumps upwards. To recreate the bug, first scroll all the way to the bottom, so it loads the next page 11, 12, and 13. Then start scrolling upwards. For the clearest version of this, keep your eye on the number 7. Watch how it almost instantaneously becomes 6.  p  pEssentially, when the content offset of the table reaches the bottom of the table, I adds an object to the tables data, then I add a row with insertRowsAtIndexPaths. p  pIve been banging my head against this problem for awhile now.

Negative 42953 pI will start by apologizing I highly doubt I will have any of the correct terminology, unfortenately after a few hours of raw testing and mashing my head against the wall I can figure this out.p  pI working with an engine the orients its models using a bottom aligned system. Meaning that the z axis in a z up system, is z  radius  origin, or if the model is sitting at 0,0,0 all the tris would be in positivez space.p  pI am integrating bullet which is a center aligned system, meaning that the objects origin is in the center of the mass in this case a simple aabb cube.p  pI have the problem that the yaw pitch roll and origin i pass into the renderer is offset by radius in the z direction. Now the biggest issue comes when the pitch or roll becomes something other than 0. Because bullets center aligned system, rotates around the pitch and roll around the center and the render rotates around the bottom. So there is a clear difference in where the model and the bounding box are lining up.p  pSo is there an algorithm to convert from these two forms of orientationp

Negative 42953 pIm lost here and I have no clue how to proceed. This is not a question about how to make my program work, this is a question about how to stop wasting my time.p  pMy programming environment is Visual Studio 2013 on windows, in C.p  pI use 3 libraries extensively, namely boost using dynamic linking, OpenCV, and Qt.p  pDuring the development, I have configured VS to look at those 3 libraries by default for include and .lib. I have also added the 3 folders containing all the dlls to my PATH environment variable.p  pIt works, but it is sometime painful, let me explain you when.p  ul lipFirst hassle Anytime I have a LNK error telling me I miss a function, it is usually on OpenCV since it has only one include file referencing all the functions. I have to look at OpenCVs source code to see what module this function belongs to and to know what I must link my program to.pli lipSecond Hassle When comes the time to deploy my application, I have to ship it with all the relevant dlls. To know which one I need, I open dependency walker and try to forget nothing, I have then to test it on a different computer because 102 of the time I have missed a couple, and then I have to configure my Installer generator to include all those one by one.pli lipThird Hassle To ease a little bit the process of configuring a new development machine, I have recently switched to NuGet. It is great, I add boost with a couple of clicks to any project. But now my boost DLLs are emeverywhereem, I have one folder per boost library, and since there are dozens of those I cant even add them all at once to my PATH now, so I have to move them manually to the appropriate folder, and that is really not what I want to do with my notsopreciousbutwhoareyoutojudge timepli ul  pI have looked around and couldnt find any good practice regarding this issue, maybe because they are too obvious, or too specific to a particular setup. p  pHow do emyouem do How would you do if you were emmeemp

Negative 42953 pI have a matrix in which each row is a sample from a distribution. I want to do a rolling comparison of the distributions using codeks.testcode and save the test statistic in each case.

So Id like this to be fast. The KolmogorovSmirnov test isnt all that mathematically complicated, so if the answer is implement it in codeRcppcode, Ill grudgingly accept that, but Id be somewhat surprised  its already very fast to compute on a single pair in R. p  pMethods Ive tried but have been unable to get working codedplyrcode using coderowwisedolagcode, codezoocode using coderollapplycode which is what I use to generate the distributions, and populating a codedata.tablecode in a loop edit this one works, but its still slow. p
Negative 42953 pLong story short, I want to get an idtoken back from Google using the OpenID Connect standard. I want to do this to authentication requests from a native Android app in order to use my MVC application like an API.p  pProblem is, when you set your responsetypeidtoken for the request to exchange your onetime access code with Google, it responds with the parameters in a url fragment  codehttpmycallbackuri.comidtokenltwhatevergtamprefreshtokenltwhatevergtcodep  pAs you probably know, this fragment stuff doesnt ever touch the server. Usually I can put a Javascript middleman in there, to handle the request and hash out the goodies, then POST them to my MVC endpoint.p  pIn the case of Android requests, however, this becomes a problem how am I supposed to preserve the original Android request when I have to make a emnewem request to get the tokens on the server sidep  pJust as background, I have my Android app getting an access code from Google and  then sending it to my web application. The web application is supposed to exchange it for an idtoken and then set up the necessary cookies for it to be authenticated.p  pAnybody know how I can accomplish this Maybe theres a different flow I need to use, or I need to simply get an idtoken in my app and send it along to my API, then verify the idtoken, and mark the request as authenticatedp  pI can post code if you think itll help.p
Negative 42953 pI have a class with a property which should have as type what in other languages would be called a generic or template interface. When I try to mimic this behavior in Swift I cannot get protocols to work with the idea. For examplep  precodeprotocol P      typealias T     func returnT gt T   class GltTgt P      var t T      initt T          self.t  t           func returnT gt T          return t        class C      var p PltIntgt                Cannot specialize nongeneric type P      initinstanceOfP PltIntgt   Cannot specialize nongeneric type P         p  instanceOfP           func usePsT gt Int          return p.returnT       P does not have a member named  returnT       codepre  pErrors from the compiler are reported as comments. It seems clear to me that such a situation should not be problematic but since Swifts protocols cannot be generics they use this obscure codetypealiascode syntax instead codeCcode has no way to know that every class that implements codePcode can be specialized for codeIntcode. Is there a Swifty way to represent this situation correctly Or is there any known workaround so that I dont have to force or degeneralize the class structurep

Negative 42953 pIm pretty new to programming and Ive written a parser in C VS2010, the .exe of which is to be called by another application when importing files of a particular extension. The parsed files are given another extension and subsequently opened. p  pThe problem is for some files, the parsing takes a few seconds, by which time the application has already looked for the file with the new extension and either opened an older version of it, or given an error message because the file syntax doesnt fit the file with the new extension not having been completely written.p  pIs there any way of of making the application wait until the parsing has finished i tried to use an fstream to open a file in the parser and close when parsing is finished with a codewhilecode loop in the application asking if the fstream was still open but it didnt work. Other than implementing some  codeforcode loop with a few seconds delay not very pretty, I cant quite think what to do. Any ideas would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance.p
Negative 42953 pI am new to scaldi.  I have a class being used in my cloud environment configuration where I want two things to happen.p  pbind [EnvironmentInfo] to new EnvironmentInfo initWith.initp  pFirst, I want it to be a singleton.  It retrieves the runtime information Google AppEngine in this case and it should do this once on instantiation.  It seems like initWith is a good choice.p  pNext, I want instantiation to be delayed until first request.  Following the execution path it is being instantiated well before the first call.p  pIf I can get delayed instantiation, then initWith should move to the class constructor.p
Negative 42953 pSo I have been trying to multithread some internet connections in python. I have been using the multiprocessing module so I can get around the Global Interpreter Lock. But it seems that the system only gives one open connection port to python, Or at least it only allows one connection to happen at once. Here is an example of what I am saying.p  pNote that this is running on a linux serverp  precodefrom multiprocessing import Process, Queue import urllib import random   Generate 10,000 random urls to test and put them in the queue queue  Queue for each in range10000     randnum  random.randint1000,10000     url  httpwww.  strrandnum  .com     queue.puturl   Main funtion for checking to see if generated url is active def checkq     while True         try             url  q.getFalse             try                 request  urllib.urlopenurl                 del request                 print url   is an active url             except                 print url   is not an active url         except             if q.empty                 break   Then start all the threads 50 for thread in range50     task  Processtargetcheck, argsqueue,     task.start codepre  pSo if you run this you will notice that it starts 50 instances on the function but only runs one at a time. You may think that the Global Interpreter Lock is doing this but it isnt. Try changing the function to a mathematical function instead of a network request and you will see that all fifty threads run simultaneously.p  pSo will I have to work with sockets Or is there something I can do that will give python access to more ports Or is there something I am not seeing Let me know what you think Thanksp  pEditp  pSo I wrote this script to test things better with the requests library.

For whatever reason, this background animation doesnt work for those rows.p  pI can somewhat achieve what I want done this wayp  precode.donefunction data      animate row background colour     var row  tblTasks  data.JobId   tbody tr[dataid  data.TaskId  ]     var hasClass  row.hasClasssuccess     row.removeClasssuccess     var bgcolour  row.cssbackgroundColor     row.animate         backgroundcolor d9534f     , 1500.delay1000.animate         backgroundcolor bgcolour     ,          duration 1000,         complete function               if hasClass row.addClasssuccess                codepre  pHowever, its not ideal, because it looks a little choppy as it removes the class and adds it back in.  p  pWhy doesnt the animate function work on rows that have classes  I was under the impression that inline styles should override classes  Does anyone have a better suggestions on how to handle thisp  pThank you, Nickp

Negative 42953 pWe were using SWIG to make a C cryptographic utility library available to Perl. We are able to generate keys, create digests, but the signing code causes a segmentation fault, which we believe may be in the OpenSSL code itself but its difficult to be sure.p  pThis problem only comes up when running the code with SWIG, the native C code works.p  pIn Perl, we call this p  precodesignature  keyutilsmysignMessageWithPempem, message codepre  pWhich calls this code in the .i

Negative 42953 pWell, so first of all I am pretty new to programming in Windows Form Application, so if I lack knowledge I hope youll understand.p  pThe program I am currently doing is a virtual piano in Windows Form Application. There are buttons on the screen, each button represent a piano button, if one is clicked  it plays a sound. Now, what I wanted to know is if there is any way that I can program my piano into detecting a continuous click and play sound until the button is unclicked. For example, if one keeps on clicking on the G chord button it will keep playing the sound until he stops clicking. p  pIf I didnt provide any necessary information I would love to know.

Negative 42953 pSo, in the asdf manualdocumentation in section 6.5 of the packageinferredsystem extension, the example uses an all.lisp file for determining packages which Iwe will assume will contain all of the function and package information for that respective subdirectoty.p  pWhat I want to know is what would be the proper way of including all of the function and package declarations in this all.lisp file. Would I do something like including all of the function declarations for that subdirectory in the all.lisp file, and then use the registersystempackages function in the asdf file. Or could I omit the all.lisp file, and let the compiler infer the packages from the files but would I have to then use the registersystempackages function for every single file I add to this system.p  pIm just wondering more about the specifics of using this system and the files and declarations that have to be made when adding a new file to the system.p  pSorry for the opacity of the question I cant seem to grasp the specifics of this systemp

Negative 42953 pNewbie warning I am using Eclipse EE to develop my first Hello Worldlevel servlets, for execution under Oracles WebServer 7.  I can successfully develop a very simple servlet that uses just the onGet method to dump out some simple HTML, and I can run it locally via Eclipse under Tomcat.  I can export a WAR file for that app, and then use WebServers admin console to add it as a web app.p  pBUT... My second app, which is a proof of concept, adds JDBC into the mix.  I again put all logic in the doGet method, and I do a simple read of an Oracle table. This too runs run under Tomcat via Eclipse, but when I attemp to add the exported WAR file to webserver 7, the admin console hangs as soon as I press OK to upload the WAR.p  ul liI have oracles ojdbc6.jar on my build path as an external jar.li liTarget java is 1.6, and Oracle is 11g.li lidevelopment machine has Java 1.7 as default JRE 1.6 is installed but I dont know how to  if I should connect to to this servlet.li liI let eclipse generate the web.xml file and have not altered it.  li ul  pI jave built batch apps that use ojdbc6 many times.  p  pSo, I can deploy a simple servlet with no extra jar into webserver 7 OK. I can run a servlet under tomcat that hits my remote database and reads data. But I cant seem to take a WAR of that project and get it to upload into webserver 7 without hanging the admin console.p  pDo you have suggestions  p
Negative 42953 pI have a method of doing this that involves R programming language, but Im looking to do this purely in excel instead to save time and make it more user friendly.p  pBasically, I need to calculate the distance between all combinations of points x,y coordinates for histological analysis.The data collected is in the form X and Y columns. There may only be two or three points, there could be as many as 100.  Imagining a data set consists of points x,y 1,2,3 and 4. I would need to calculate distances 1 to 2, 1 to 3, 1 to 4, 2 to 3, 2 to 4 and 3 to 4. p  pIdeally, I would have a macro that prompts you to select the X column, then the y column, click ok, then copies the resulting distances to the clipboard or to a new workbook. p  pAny thoughts on this or refer me to preexisting forums that may be similar to thisp  pMostly, I lack the knowledge of how combinations work in VBA and how to keep the x and y for any given point together.p

Negative 42953 pFor a webpage I created, I am querying a webpage using Google Visualization Query. However, it throws an errorp  blockquote   pSCRIPT1002 Syntax error File formaten,defaulten,uien,tableen.I.js, Line 26, Column 315p blockquote  pIt tells me where the error is occurring in Googles JavaScript file, but not in the queried webpages code, which is causing the Google code to throw the error.p  pI have tried all sorts of code validations for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and they all say that the code is fine and I have looked over the code many times and cant seem to find it although, I only have access to Notepad so that may be a problem.p  pSo, I am hoping that someone here will see something that Im not seeing.p  precodeltDOCTYPE htmlgt codepre  pp  precodeltheadgt     lttitlegtUntitled Spreadsheetlttitlegt     ltmeta nameviewport

Negative 42953 pIm developing a medium scale application using Symfony2 and Doctrine2. Im trying to structure my code according to the SOLID principles as much as possible. Now here is the questionbr For creating strongnewstrong Entities, I use Symfony Forms with proxy objects i.e I dont bind the form directly to my Entity, but to some other class that will passed to some service which will take the needed action based on the received data, i.e the proxy class serves as a DTO to that service which I will call the codeHandlercode. Now considering the codeHandlercode doesnt have a dependency on the codeEntityManagercode, where should I do calls to codeEntityManagerpersistcode and codeEntityManagerflushcode I am usually comfortable with putting codeflushcode in the controller but Im not so sure about codepersistcode since the controller shouldnt assume anything about what the codeHandlercode does, and maybe codeHandlerhandlecode the method that the form data is passed to does more than just persist a new Entity to the database. One Idea is to create some codeinterfacescode to encapsulate codeflushcode and codepersistcode and pass them around, which will act as wrappers around codeEntityManagerflushcode and codeEntityManagerpersistcode, but Im not so sure about it since codeEntityManagerflushcode might create unwanted consequences. So Maybe I should just create an interface around codepersistcode.br So My question is where and how to make the call to codepersistcode and codeflushcode, in order to get the most Solid code Or am I just overcomplicating things in  my quest of best practicesp

Negative 42953 pI have a wordpress site, and I need to move some javascript to the footer.  I am using a theme photocrati that only uses the wpenqueuescripts tag a total of 4 times in the header.php file.p  pWhat Im looking to do is find a way, hopefully dynamically, to move the javascript files to the footer.  I realize this would be much easier using the infooter if they were properly referenced using the enqueuescripts, but alas, thats not the case.p  pBeing that this is a photography studio website, I need to do everything I can to reduce loading time.  Now, obviously Im not about to move CSS to the footer like google page speed recommends because I dont want my site being rendered unformatted when the visitor first views it.p  pAfter doing everything else I can I obviously cant do anything about minimizing or setting leveraging browser caching on files not hosted with my site, ie the google analytics js file, the page speed insights recommends, Remove renderblocking JavaScript and CSS in abovethefold content is all I have left.  I am hoping once I move the js to the footer my page load time will be under 5 seconds considering it is now just under 6 and there are 19 script resources.p  pHopefully someone can give me some guidance on being able to do this through some PHP code added to the functions.php file since I for the most part understand whats going on with PHP code when I am writing.  But, I am having a hard time deciphering what is going on in the header file, and being able to find all 19 js files to delete them from the header file and enqueue them properly.p  pemEDITem Here is the header.php file.  Ive noticed that some of the scripts are not even called here in any way because when I search the file for say hoverintent.js its nowhere to be found, but if I search the source code after my page loads, sure enough its in the header.p  precodeltphp  preset  PhotocratiStyleManagergetactivepreset  extractpresetgttoarray    rcp  wpdbgtgetresultsSELECT fsrightclick,lightboxmode,lightboxtype FROM .wpdbgtprefix.photocratigallerysettings WHERE id  1  foreach rcp as rcp       fsrightclick  rcpgtfsrightclick      lightboxmode  rcpgtlightboxmode      lightboxtype  rcpgtlightboxtype    music  wpdbgtgetresultsSELECT musicblog,musicblogauto,musicblogfile,musicblogcontrols,musiccat,musiccatauto,musiccatfile,musiccatcontrols FROM .wpdbgtprefix.photocratigallerysettings WHERE id  1  foreach music as music       musicblog  musicgtmusicblog      musicblogauto  musicgtmusicblogauto      musicblogcontrols  musicgtmusicblogcontrols      musicblogfile  musicgtmusicblogfile      musiccat  musicgtmusiccat      musiccatauto  musicgtmusiccatauto      musiccatcontrols  musicgtmusiccatcontrols      musiccatfile  musicgtmusiccatfile    gt  ltDOCTYPE html PUBLIC W3CDTD XHTML 1.0 TransitionalEN httpwww.w3.orgTRxhtml1DTDxhtml1transitional.dtdgt  lt[if IE 9 ]gt lthtml xmlnshttpwww.w3.org1999xhtml ltphp languageattributes gt classie9gtltlt[endif]gt  lt[if gt IE 9IE]gtltgt lthtml xmlnshttpwww.w3.org1999xhtml ltphp languageattributes gtgtltlt[endif]gt  lthead profilehttpgmpg.orgxfn11gt  ltphp  PhotocratiFontsrendergooglefontlinkarray      arrayfontstyle, fontweight, fontitalic,      arraysidebarfontstyle, sidebarfontweight, sidebarfontitalic,      arraysidebartitlestyle, sidebartitleweight, sidebartitleitalic,      arraytitlestyle, titlefontweight, titleitalic,      arrayh1fontstyle, h1fontweight, h1fontitalic,      arrayh2fontstyle, h2fontweight, h2fontitalic,      arrayh3fontstyle, h3fontweight, h3fontitalic,      arrayh4fontstyle, h4fontweight, h4fontitalic,      arrayh5fontstyle, h5fontweight, h5fontitalic,      arraydescriptionstyle, descriptionfontweight, descriptionfontitalic,      arraymenufontstyle, menufontweight, menufontitalic,      arraysubmenufontstyle, submenufontweight, submenufontitalic,      arrayfooterwidgetstyle, footerwidgetweight, footerwidgetitalic,      arrayfooterfontstyle, footerfontweight, footerfontitalic    gt  lttitlegtltphp      if  issingle   singleposttitle              elseif  ishome  isfrontpage   bloginfoname print    bloginfodescription getpagenumber       elseif  ispage   singleposttitle       elseif  issearch   bloginfoname print   Search results for  . wpspecialcharss getpagenumber       elseif  is404   bloginfoname print   Not Found       else  bloginfoname wptitle getpagenumber   gtlttitlegt    ltmeta httpequivcontenttype contentltphp bloginfohtmltype gt charsetltphp bloginfocharset gt gt  ltmeta httpequivXUACompatible contentIE9 gt    lt IMPORTANT Do not remove this code.

Negative 42953 pI want to have a list of objects that satisfies just a few basic requirements. It needs to support fast random access and it needs to be safe to use from multiple threads. Reads will dominate by far and ideally should be about as fast as normal codeArrayListcode access, i.e. no locking. There is no need to insert elements in the middle, delete, or change the value at an index the only mutation required is to be able to append a new element to the end of the list. More specifically a caller will specify an index at which an element should be placed, and the index is expected to be only a few more than the length of the list, i.e. the list is dense. There is also no need for iteration.p  pIs there anything that supports this in Java It can be in a third party library.p  pIf not I am thinking I will implement my own class. Therell be an internal array of arrays, each twice as big as the last. Lookups by index will do just a little more maths to figure out which array has the right element and what the index in that array is. Appends will be similar unless they go beyond the available space, in which case a new array is allocated. Only the creation of a new array will require a lock to be acquired.p  pDoes this sound like a sensible approachp  pThis doesnt sound like a particularly novel data structure. Does it have a namep
