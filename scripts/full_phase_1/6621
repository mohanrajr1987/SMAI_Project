The primary difference being the application is NOT meant for a developer environment, and therefore I need to know how to optimize the space used by Sql Server possibly per machine based on specs.p  pI was intrigued by a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comusers10795ricardocRicardo Csa answer, particularly the followingp  blockquote   pExtracted fromt he SQL Server   documentationp      pMaximum server memory in MBp      pSpecifies the maximum amount of memory SQL Server can allocate when it   starts and while it runs. This   configuration option can be set to a   specific value if you know there are   multiple applications running at the   same time as SQL Server and you want   to guarantee that these applications   have sufficient memory to run. If   these other applications, such as Web   or email servers, request memory only   as needed, then do not set the option,   because SQL Server will release memory   to them as needed. strongHowever,   applications often use whatever memory   is available when they start and do   not request more if neededstrong. If an   application that behaves in this   manner runs on the same computer at   the same time as SQL Server, set the   option to a value that guarantees that   the memory required by the application   is not allocated by SQL Server.p blockquote  pMy question is how does an application request memory from the OS when it needs it  Is this something built into compilation or something managed by the developer  The two primary apps running on this machine are Sql Server and the fairly heavyweight C application Im developing, and Im almost certain we didnt specifically do anything in the realm of asking the OS for memory.

It is painful when a method takes codeargscode and codekwargscode but does not document which values can be given.pli lipBad Python coding practices, like adding new attributes outside of codeinitcode. Things like this make the code hard to read or to maintain.pli lipHardly any libraries follow the PEP8 coding conventions. Sometimes the conventions are not even consistent in a single file.pli lipThe overall design is messy, with no clear API. It seems that not nearly enough refactoring is done.pli lipPoor unittest coverage.pli ul  pDont get me wrong, emI absolutely love Python and its ecosystemem. And even though I struggled with these libraries emthey generally get the job done and I am grateful for thatem. But I also think that in the end tons of developer time are wasted because of these issues. Maybe that is because emPython gives you so much freedom that it is very easy to write bad codeem.p

Negative 6621 pAs a way to learn NHibernate, I came up with a small project that includes a typical users amp groups authentication system.  It got me thinking about how this would be done.

I ended up with a threetable database schema with a many to many association table between the User and Group tables.p  precodepublic class User      public virtual string Username  get set      public virtual byte[] PasswordHash  get set      public virtual IListltGroupgt Groups  get set    public class Group      public virtual string Name  get set      public virtual IListltUsergt Users  get set   codepre  pMy question is regarding the scaleability and potential performance of this sort of class design.

Negative 6621 pRather than trying to piece out the individual pains Im dealing with, I want to give the 10 000 feet overview of it. I learn .NET as I go, and I suspect that there is something obvious that Im missing here. Im sitting working overtime on a Sunday and Id really appreciate if someone would toss in their five cents.p  hr  pHere goesp  pOur mainstay product is a process control system.  There are many possible ways of extendingcustomizing the system. We have traditionally separated the control system release from the specific configuration of the Process Plant being controlled so that the two can be maintained seperately.p  pCControl System base release   I call this strongCSstrong  This is the base release. Bug fixes etc.p  pCDelivery Project  I call this strongProjstrong    This is the information of the system being controlled. p  pA little backgroundp  ul liOur service engineers expects to be able to reinstall or upgrade the CS folder without loss of customization data.li liThe Delivery project is traditionally deployed by XCOPY.li liThere is some dllreferencing between the two, which works fine in the MFC. li liOn our lab machines, it is common to have many versions installed simultaneously. li liThe system is launched from .batfiles residing in the delivery project that sets up the environment and then launches. The launching process is environmentvariable intense.li ul  pNow, I experience some difficulties in accommodating this model when using .NET.  When the system is using embedded .NET controls or displays a winform, the mscorlib is loaded on demand with CSRunbin  being the app base path. This presents me with some problemsp  ul li.NET assemblies deployed under Proj are outside the app base path.li li.NET assemblies deployed under CSRunbin will be deleted if people reinstall the control system base. I can make deployment part of the batch startup, of course.li li.NET assemblies paths are provided by textual configuration residing in the Proj folder structure. Relative paths within the delivery project is common, but is a problem when they start accessing CS, which is subject to change.li li.NET assemblies deployed under CSRunbin may have further dependencies. I may have two different versions of Util1.dll under CSrunbinext1 and CSrunbin . This results in CLR not being able to resolve CSrunbinext1util1.dll because of the probing path order. li liI have experimented with seperating appdomains, but instances of classes found in CSrunbinext1ext1.dll can number in the hundreds. And I make heavy use of Singletons static to coordinate resource management.li ul  pNeedless to say, I use a lot of Reflector and Fuslogvw. Are there any more tools that I should know of  Is it possible to inspect running processes for the CLR information within them Since the mscorlib is loaded on demand, I sometimes find that CLR has a app base that is way off. This sometimes prevents my code from being loaded, so I cant access the appdomain programatically or output it to trace.p  pIs there any way to control the probing path to start relative from the calling assembly before starting from the app base pathp  pCan mixed mode assemblies in the GAC access MFC resources in CSp  pAlthough I dont own the MFC code base that loads the mscorlib on demand, I do have a saying in it. Is there something that can be done from there I am going to request that key information when loading mscorlib is output to trace as well as exceptions.p  pArticles, tools or a short description of some aspect I appear to be missing would be appreciated.p  pI appreciate you taking the time to read this and to maintain a clear head throughout this legacy pain Im describing here p

So the computations refer to vector array multiplication to a scalar and addition of 2 vectors, as well as sorting the final INDEX variable vector of 100,000 values.p

Say for instance theyve worked for McDonalds, there could be 20 different franchises, they build a list of locations theyve worked. 3 weeks later there could be another 3 new locations and 2 may have closed down. So we need to ensure the forms are able to handle those situations.p  pThe forms themselves markup and data change every year  I should mention that this for a taxationfinancebudget system.p  pWe were thinking of using MVC, using Xml to store the data temporarily, XSD to validate the data, XSL to transform the data to presentable markup for them to fill out and then once they Submit an application it gets stored into the DB in relevant areas.p  pWhen the user starts the application process, they can save the progress so far we validate whatever they entred and ignore any they havent, save it as an Xml blob and store in the DB. When theyre finally ready to submit it, then we do a full validation and upload the files and store them securely it has their business proofs and accounting statements and then run some workflows.p  pWhat Im really concerned about is how to manage changing forms versions a year later. How are formapplication systems written these days We have 2 months to pull this off and about 30 forms to deliver. So 30xXML, 30xXSD, 30xXSL.p

This is limited to small expressions that are then merged into a dynamically generated Java source file.p  pSo far  so good. Everything works.p  pBUT  I wish to be able to embed the line number of the XML node where the Java code was included from so that if the configuration contains uncompilable code, each method will have a pointer to the source XML document and the line number for ease of debugging. I dont require the line number at parsetime and I dont need to validate the XML Source Document and throw an error at a particular line number. I need to be able to access the line number for each node and attribute in my DOM or per SAX event.p  pAny suggestions on how I might be able to achieve thisp  pP.S.  Also, I read the StAX has a method to obtain line number whilst parsing, but ideally I would like to achieve the same result with regular SAXDOM processing in Java 45 rather than become a Java 6 application or take on extra .jar files.p

Negative 6621 pIm trying to figure out which is the safest strategy for protecting my filebased SQLite database from corruption in this case, Im working with Adobe Air, but this could apply to any webkit browser that uses SQLite, including Mobile Safari. p  pIm thinking about creating a database connection, keeping it around for only maybe 5 or 10 seconds and then closing it if it hasnt been used during that period. My thinking is that should the machine crash or the application exit abnormally, chances are good that the file will already be closed and thus less likely to get corrupted. But I know that the more often you open and close a filebased DB, the more likely it is youll have a critical error.p  pIm sure Im overthinking this, but for my application its critical that in the event of a system crash, the application can recover cleanly and quickly and that means I have to try to protect the DB as much as I can.p  pDoes anyone know which strategy is likely to be saferp

Negative 6621 pHow do you properly unload a DLL from all processes when the systemwide hook that loaded them gets unloadedp  pFrom a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms64496028vVS.8529.aspxsystemevents relnofollowMSDNa p  blockquote   pYou can release a global hook   procedure by using   UnhookWindowsHookEx, strongbut this function   does not free the DLL containing the   hook procedurestrong. This is because global   hook procedures are called in the   process context of every application   in the desktop, causing an implicit   call to the LoadLibrary function for   all of those processes. Because a call   to the FreeLibrary function cannot be   made for another process, there is   then no way to free the DLL. The   system eventually frees the DLL after   all processes explicitly linked to the   DLL have either terminated or called   FreeLibrary and all processes that   called the hook procedure have resumed   processing outside the DLL.p blockquote  pSo what I am looking for, is a method to detect when the hook is unhooked, and then call codeFreeLibrarycode from all the processes that were hooked. Are there any other ways to cause instant unloading of a DLL when the hook is unloadedp

Negative 6621 pI am developing an asp.net mvc 2 web application. My clients will most likely want a copy of my application to be hosted on their servers instead of me hosting it on my server for all clients.p  pHowever I see a problem with this because I was planning to use the .net 2.0 encryptor to encrypt my web.config to make it safer.  I got to thinking well I am only going to give them my .dll and views and etc their not going to get the soultion of my file so they can load it up and have a look at what is going on.p  pSo what happens if I encrypt the web.config and all of a sudden the database connect string changes Let it be the address changes or the username password changes.p  pHow would they change it if it is encrypted Would that mean I would have to rebuild my site and send them a new copy with the changes Or is their a different wayp  pIf there is no other way it got me thinking should I What happens if some thing happens and for whatever reason I cant get the new changes to them until 48 hours later. That means they cant use the service for 48 hours.  p  pI have no problem providing support but when it starts coming to little things that they probably should have control to change in the first place they probably should.p  pI would prefer to have it encrypted but at the same time if I have to make all changes to the web.config that is not good either. Since it could open up different security concerns as they have to get the changes to me some how.p

However, as far as I understand, UiBinder is at its best when corresponding template contains losts of static information. p  pIn my case, mobile app, most of the screen areas contain dynamic information. For instance, there is a panel with buttons, but you dont know ahead of time how many buttons are shown at a single time. That is why I am using HTMLPanel.addWidget wgt, String id or FlowPanel.add methods in the owning UiBinder class. Isnt that diminishes use of UiBinder and ablility to call setInnerHTML instead of creating elements trough DOM operations because these add methods only accept widgets and not elementsp  pMaybe there is a trick which would allow to add Element object instead of Widget objects to panels and they would then use setInnerHTML to its fullestp  pThanksp

Negative 6621 pMy app may launch a subactivity for a specific purpose. When that activity finishes, I get the results in onActivityResult. These results are then processed in the subsequent onResume. This consists of a setContentView and also starting an AsyncTask that puts up a ProgressDialog.p  pThis all works well when initiated the normal way, which is via a user request i.e., menu selection after the app is up and running. However, under some conditions I need to do this right as the app is starting up, so I initiate this sequence right from my onCreate. What then happens is that I get fatal ResourceNotFound errors within any os call that implicitly calls the layout inflater. I got around this with setContentView by preinflating the view in my onCreate method, but the AsyncTasks onPreExecute still fails on ProgressDialog.show as it fails to find Androids own progressdialog.xmlp  pAnyone know whats happening herep  pI suspect its something to do with the timing, where this is occurring before the main activity has even had a chance to display its screen. These calls are all being made on the main UI thread, but maybe something hasnt completed within the os under these conditions.p

Negative 6621 pAccording to this a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.combexcelarchive20050926474258.aspx relnofollowMicrosoft blog posta the max string length per cell is 32k for MS Office 2010 Ive also confirmed this via testing. Problem is that Ive got strings DNA sequences that are well above that length, and Im matching subsequences of DNA on the whole 32k sequence that could match anywhere on the main sequence meaning that I can not simple break the main sequence out into 32k chucks, since I need to be able to string match the substringsequence to the entire mainstringsequence. One thing that is not clear is if VBA supports processing of strings large than 32k, if VBA supports string concatenation in excess of 32k that might be a work around meaning I chunk the mainstringsequence into 32k chunks on a row to the Nth column, then when I need to process a match just concatenate the strings in a row from column 1 to the Nth, process the match, then dump the temp mainstringsequence being stored in VBA.p  pSo, basically the issue is MSOffice 2010 only supports strings per cell up to 32k in length, and Ive got strings that are much larger than that which need to be processed in whole form in order for the string matching to work. p

At some point they would have to be triggered at the same time Not sure if this would be the best way. Any guidanceideas would be greatly appreciatedp  pThanks for your time.p

Negative 6621 pIs it only the explain plan to look in when tuning a large sql string  Because when I push CtrlE in TOAD for Oracle which generates explain plan, this takes several seconds.

Negative 6621 pI have a table with 2 computed columns, both of which has Is Persisted set to strongtruestrong. However, when using them in a query the Execution Plan shows the UDF used to compute the columns as part of the plan. Since the column data is calculated by the UDF when the row is addedupdated why would the plan include itp  pThe query is incredibly slow 30s when these columns are included in the query, and lightning fast lt1s when they are excluded. This leads me to conclude that the query is actually calculating the column values at run time, which shouldnt be the case since they are set to persisted.p  pAm I missing something herep  pUPDATE Heres a little more info regarding our reasoning for using the computed column.p  pWe are a sports company and have a customer who stores full player names in a single column. They require us to allow them to search player data by first andor last name separately. Thankfully they use a consistent format for player names  LastName, FirstName NickName  so parsing them is relatively easy. I created a UDF that calls into a CLR function to parse the name parts using a regular expression. So obviously calling the UDF, which in turn calls a CLR function, is very expensive. But since it is only used on a empersistedem column I figured it would only be used during the few times a day that we import data into the database.p

Negative 6621 pOne of my apps has a simple metronomestyle feature that plays a click sound a specified number of times per minute bpm. Im doing this by starting an NSTimer, with an interval calculated from the specified bpm, that calls a method that plays the sound.p  pIf I put an NSLog line into the play method, I can see that NSTimer is firing accurately to about 1 millisecond. However, if I record the sound output into an audio editor and then measure the interval between clicks, I can see that they are not evenly spaced. For example, with 150 bpm, the timer fires every 400 milliseconds. But most of the sounds play after 395 milliseconds, with every third or fourth sound playing after 418 milliseconds.p  pSo the sounds are not uniformly delayed, but rather, they follow a pattern of shorter and longer intervals. It seems as if the iOS has a lower resolution for timing of sounds, and is rounding each sound event to the nearest available point, rounding up or down as needed to keep on track overall.p  pI have tried this with system sounds, AVAudioPlayer and OpenAL and have gotten the exact same results with all three methods. With each method, Im doing all the setup when the view loads, so each time I play the sound all I have to do is play it. With AVAudioPlayer, I tried calling prepareToPlay using a second timer after each time the sound plays, so it is initialized and ready to go next time, but got the same results.p  pHeres the code for setting up the OpenAL sound in viewDidLoad adapted from a hrefhttpbenbritten.com20081106openalsoundontheiphone relnofollowthis tutorialap  precode set up the context and device ALCcontext context ALCdevice device OSStatus result device  alcOpenDeviceNULL  select the preferred device if device      context  alcCreateContextdevice, NULL  use the device to make a context     alcMakeContextCurrentcontext  set the context to the currently active one    open the sound file NSString soundFilePath  [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResourceTempoClick ofTypecaf] NSURL soundFileURL  [NSURL fileURLWithPathsoundFilePath] AudioFileID fileID result  AudioFileOpenURLCFURLRefsoundFileURL, kAudioFileReadPermission, 0, ampfileID if result  0 DLogcannot open file  ld, soundFilePath, result   get the size of the file data UInt32 fileSize  0 UInt32 propSize  sizeofUInt64 result  AudioFileGetPropertyfileID, kAudioFilePropertyAudioDataByteCount, amppropSize, ampfileSize if result  0 DLogcannot find file size ld, result DLogfile size li, fileSize   copy the data into a buffer, then close the file unsigned char outData  mallocfileSize AudioFileOpenURLCFURLRefsoundFileURL, kAudioFileReadPermission, 0, ampfileID  we get a file is not open error on the next line if we dont open this again result  AudioFileReadBytesfileID, false, 0, ampfileSize, outData if result  0 NSLogcannot load data ld, result AudioFileClosefileID alGenBuffers1, amptempoSoundBuffer alBufferDataself.tempoSoundBuffer, ALFORMATMONO16, outData, fileSize, 44100 freeoutData outData  NULL   connect the buffer to the source and set some preferences alGenSources1, amptempoSoundSource  alSourceitempoSoundSource, ALBUFFER, tempoSoundBuffer alSourceftempoSoundSource, ALPITCH, 1.0f alSourceftempoSoundSource, ALGAIN, 1.0f alSourceitempoSoundSource, ALLOOPING, ALFALSE codepre  pAnd then in the play method I just callp  precodealSourcePlayself.tempoSoundSource codepre  pCan anyone explain what is happening here, and how I can work around itp  pUPDATE 1p  pI have another project that plays brief sounds with audio units, so as a quick test I added a timer to that project to play my click sound every 400 milliseconds. In that case, the timing is nearly perfect. So, it seems that NSTimer is fine but system sounds, AVAudioPlayer and OpenAL are less accurate in their playback than audio units.p  pUPDATE 2p  pI just reworked my project to use audio units and now the audio is playing back much more accurately. It still occasionally drifts by up to four milliseconds in either direction, but this is better than the other audio methods. Im still curious why the other methods all show a pattern of short, short, short, long intervals  its like the audio playback times are being rounded up or down to map to some kind of frame rate  so Ill leave this question open for anyone who can explain that andor offer a workaround for the other audio methods.p

Negative 6621 pI was wondering how do i create consistent UI across all the platform rather than constant UI. Here by consistent i mean UI should look native to that particular platform. For example a tab bar in iOS is at the bottom and has particular look and feel whereas tab bar in Android is at the top and has different look.p  pIf i create tab bar in sencha it is by default at the bottom and provides a blue look and feel much similar to iOS, but it wont work for Android because with default look I will loose the Android app feel, it will be like iOS app inside Android. So how do i address this issue Do i write if else conditions for all the platforms to layout components correctly and apply specific CSS or I can do it through theming and if yes to what extend i can do things using theming Note my aim is not only having different branding of components but also changing their positions orientations etc. p  pThe answers of these kind of questions are must as these would decide whether we should adopt sencha as cross platform tool or not. I would be grateful if i can get any working example of this kind which runs on iPhoneiPadAndroid phone Android Pads providing their platform specific UIs.p  pThanks, Tarun.p

Negative 6621 pI recently inherited an ASP.NET project from another programmer that required consolidating two databases. After consolidating them and fixing the resulting problems in the code I dropped the aspnet membership tables and then recreated them with the aspnetregsql wizard. I created several users and roles and in my application was able to log in just fine using a standard asp.net login control. I then logged out and tried to log in again and it didnt work.p  pIn an attempt to pinpoint the problem I set breakpoints at the events LoggingIn, Authenticate, and LoggedIn and somehow none of these events are getting fired. The page will validate, but if you enter the correct credentials it seems to just post back without firing any of the login events.p  pEventually I got frustrated and moved on to something else. Then today the next day I came in and checked again and somehow it let me log in the first time. I tried to log out and log back in and I got the same exact problem.

Negative 6621 pI like to use several different workspaces, so as to keep everything organized. However, its annoying to have to copy the .settings folder to all my workspaces just because I added a keyboard shortcut.

The settings I care about are keyboard shortcuts, code style, fonts, etc.p  pI have found a hrefhttpmarketplace.eclipse.orgnode1003 relnofollowthis plugina which might be useful, but doesnt seem to be exactly what Im looking for.p  pIdeally, I could have my settings saved in the cloud somewhere. On startup, Eclipse will check if workspace settings and the settings in the cloud differ, and if so, import them from the cloud. If I change any settings, then these preferences should be exported to the cloud. This way I also have my preferences on my schools lab machines.p  pDoes anybody know a way to make this work Im all ears.p  pThanksp

Negative 6621 pIm having a few issues with duplicate records in my database which I believe are being caused by people clicking submit multiple times. I am using Rails 3.p  pstrongReturn the duplicated object rather than falsestrongp  pI would like to be able to prevent duplicates from being added to my database, but would prefer it if when saving a duplicate, the object that was duplicated was returned, rather than false. The reason being that if someone clicks submit several times, I would like them to be taken to a page showing them the item they submitted first, rather than to an error page.p  pstrongDefinition of a duplicatestrongp  pIm defining a duplicate as an item in which all the fields except the ID are the same, and createdat  Time.now  1.minutep  pstrongNo JavaScriptstrongp  pI would prefer to do this serverside rather than just disabling the button in JavaScript since I dont think database integrity is a client side job. Also, it feels like it should be done in the model, rather than the controller. Im running multiple passengers, so any solution should ideally avoid concurrency issues as much as possible.

Negative 6621 pCan a template template variadic be used to catch all cases of a template parameter being passed that is itself a templatep  pIve been using templating to produce debug output for some template based methods.

These are triggered e.g. by incoming message on a TCP Portp  pMy goal is to generate a class for example abstract one, which has abstract functions as onInit, etc. A programmer should just inherit from this base class and should merely override these abstract functions of the base class.p  pThe rest as of the protocol e.g. should be simply handled in the background using the code of the base class and should not need to appear in the programmers code. p  pWhat is the correct design strategy for such tasks and how do I deal with, that the static main method is not inheritable What are the keytags for this problem I have problem searching for a solution since I lack clear statements on this problemp  pGoal is to create some sort of libraryclass, which  included in ones code  results in executables following the protocol.p  pstrongEDIT new explanationstrongp  pOkay let me try to explain more detailledp  pIn this case programs should be clients within a client server architecture. We have a client server connection via TCPIP. Each program needs to follow a specific protocol upon program start p  pAs soon as my program starts and gets connected to the server it will receive an Init Message TcpClient, when this happens it should trigger the function onInit.  Should this be implemented by an event system After onInit a acknowledgement message should be sent to the server. Afterwards there are some other steps as e.g. a config message from the server which triggers an onConfig and so on. Lets concentrate on the onInit function.p  pstrongThe idea is, that onInit and onConfig and so on should be the only functions the programmer should edit while the overall protocol messaging is hidden for him.strongp  pTherefore, I thought using an abstract class with the abstract methods onInit, onConfig in it should be the right thing. The static Main class I would like to hide, since within it e.g. there will be some part which connects to the tcp port, which reacts on the Init Message and which will call the onInit function.  2 problems here  1. the static main class cant be inherited, isn it 2. I cannot call abstract functions from the main class in the abstract master class.p  pLet me give an Pseudoexample for my ideasp  precode public abstract class MasterClass       static void Mainstring[] args           1. open TCP connection          2. waiting for Init Message from server          3. onInit          4. Send Acknowledgement, that Init Routine has ended successfully          5. waiting for Config message from server          6.....           public abstract void onInit     public abstract void onConfig  codepre  pI hope you get the idea now The programmer should afterwards inherit from this masterclass and merely need to edit the functions onInit and so on.p  pIs this way possible How What else do you recommend for solving thisp  pEDIT The strategy ideo provided below is a good one Check out my comment on that.p

Negative 6621 pIm making a game and I an ingame editor that is able to create entities on the fly rather than hard coding them.  Im using a componentaggregation model, so my entities are nothing but a list of components.p  pWhat would be the best way to obtain or generate a list of components  I really dont want to have to manually add entries for all possible components in some giant registerAllComponents method or something.p  pI was thinking maybe somehow with reflection via either the knowledge that all components inherit from the base Component class, or possibly via custom metatags but I havent been able to find ways to get a list of all classes that derive from a class or all classes that have custom metatags.p  pWhat sort of options am I left withp  pThanks.p

Negative 6621 pIm creating an application using PHP and involving MySQL.

Negative 6621 pI have a table that is exposed to large inserts and deletes on a regular basis and because of this there are large gaps in the number sequence of the primary id column. It had a primary id column of type int that was changed to bigint. Despite this change, the limit of this datatype will also inevitably be exceeded at some point in the future current usage would indicate this to be the case within the next year or so. p  pHow do you handle this scenario Im wondering shock horror whether I even need the primary key column as its not used in any obvious way in any queries or referenced by other tables etc. Would removing the column be a solution Or would that sort of action see you expelled from the mysql community in disgust p  pWere already nearly at the 500 million mark for the auto increment id. The table holds keywords associated with file data in a separate table. Each file data row could have as many as 30 keywords associated with it in the keywords table, so they really start to stack up after youve got tens of thousands of files constantly being inserted and deleted. Currently the keyword table contains the keyword and the id of the file its associated with, so if I got rid of the current primary id column, there would be no unique identifier other than the keyword varchar and file id int fields combined, which would be a terrible primary key.p  pAll thoughtsanswersexperiencessolutions very gratefully received.p

Negative 6621 pI recently learnt that SunsOracles most recent guidelines say that no Swing methods of any Swing objects, including constructors, must be called outside the EDT.  p  pDoes the same standard of rigour apply to all visual AWT classes too  If not, what  are  the rules for themp  pemstronglateremstrongp  pre Swing and EDT discussion from 2009.p  pa hrefhttpwww.velocityreviews.comforumst707173whydoesjdk16recommendcreatingswingcomponentsontheedt.html relnofollowhttpwww.velocityreviews.comforumst707173whydoesjdk16recommendcreatingswingcomponentsontheedt.htmlap  pquote Besides actual thread safety and associated issues like visibility and synchronization, theres I think a software issue. Swing components often have listeners of some type, and these listeners are designed to execute on the EDT.p  pSince these listeners are asynchronous and respond to events like property changes its possible to have these listeners fire as you construct your GUI. The result is that some listeners are being executed on the EDT as you are constructing in your main thread, and some listeners might be running on some other thread as well because the listener is confused and fires on the wrong thread. The result is a huge unpredictable mess.p  pmaybe they dont know what theyre talking about... but at the moment Im taking a better safe than sorry approach.

To ensure that the readings are taken closer to minutely instead of minutely  overhead time, the program creates a child to do the actual work, and then sleeps for 60 seconds before creating another child.p  pThe trouble Im having is that the SIGCHLD from the children are interrupting the sleep60, causing unlimited children to be created, instead of one per minute.p  pThis is how Ive been trying to do itp  precodewhile1        Create a child to do the work      ifpid  fork lt 0              perrorfork         exit1          else ifpid gt 0              parent continues         select0, 0, NULL, NULL, amptime         claimchildren         continue          Now in the child     processpvs  codepre  pIve also heard that select can be used to achieve what Im after by doing the followingp  precodestruct timeval time  time.tvsec  60 time.tvusec  0  select0, 0, 0, 0, time codepre  pBut for some reason this only works for 1 iteration in the while loop.

This can produce strange results.p  pFor example, imagine you have two fields, title and body, and there are two documents with the exact same title, but they wont be a match because all words from the title occur more often in other documents bodys, and vice versa. That seems pretty odd to me.p  pAnother example I use it in a system which filters the results by userdependent access permissions, and there it happened that the user for whom the query was generated could not see the documents which were responsible for the high docFreq of the chosen field. The generated query didnt find any documents, although there were plenty docs the user could see, containing the exact terms, just in the wrong field.p  pI wonder why they dont just use all fields, or at least the fields in which the terms occur originally.  Sure, it may be a performance issue. But Ive implemented it to use all the fields where the term occurs in the original document, plus the one with the highest docFreq.

Looking at some articles online has given me a basic insight into what I have so far in terms of filling my property editors etc. This cannot be added in this way though for what I need, in this example I need GetValues to populate based on the strings assigned to SomeList in the first unit as I said before FSomeList could be TListBox for example.pli lipThis relates to problem 2 in how can I get my property editor when working to communicate with my treeview so I can populate it accordinglypli ol  pI would be truly grateful if someone could give me some pointers, or better still direct me to a good articleguide on writing property editors. The ones I have read such as on Delphi.about, DelphiDabbler etc are not easy for me to understand and follow I get confused and bogged down with problems rather easily.p  pMany thanksp

Negative 6621 pAfter uncovering some potential performance issues I was having with Mojarra, I recently switched my application to run on MyFaces 2.1.10 implementation from Mojarra 2.1.7.p  pI have been using the OmniFaces SEO feature that allows for pretty extensionless URLs.  This operates through the use of a servlet filter and is automatically enabled by adding a context parameter to the codeweb.xmlcode as well as adding a directory codefacesviewscode to WEBINF that mirrors the xhtml document layout of web application.p  pI was a bit concerned about compatibility issues with Spring however, as I am utilizing the Spring Container and their custom EL resolver that replaces JSF dependency injection with Spring dependency injection, making every managed bean also a Spring bean.  Even more worrying is that I am implementing Spring Security which also operates through the use of a servlet filter to intercept and authenticate incoming requests.  My worry was that perhaps the two wouldnt work correctly if they happened to be invoked in a certain order.p  pWell the ExtensionlessURLS feature with Mojarra worked a bit different than what was described in the a hrefhttpshowcase.omnifaces.orgfacesviewsExtensionlessURLs relnofollowdocumentationap  pI noticed that to get it work in Mojarra, I simply had to leave my xhtml files in their original locations, however I needed to place an empty file of the same name and relative path in the codefacesviewscode directory.  The filter seemed to recognize either extensionless or XHTML requests and display the page appropriatelyp  pWhen I switched to MyFaces however, this behavior changed where now the empty files in codefacesviewscode directory were causing a Premature EOF Exception to be thrown on page request.  I noticed that to be able to serve both XHTML and extensionless requests that I needed to keep duplicate copies of the same page in both places.p  pI tried to work around this by having the file in codefacesviewscode do a  and it found the source but the page wasnt loading correctly when I did this.p  pMy question is, why am I seeing different behavior between Mojarra and MyFaces with ExtensionlessURLs  Could Spring Security by the reason for this  How can I work around this issue to where I do not need to keep two copies of the same source code in my project clearly I am inviting silly errors and missed features by accepting thisp

Negative 6621 pI am working on a legacy SQLBase database and am trying to set up a new project with NHibernate. p  pA big problem is the format SQLBase expects the bind variables in the SQL to be. The format has to be explicitly p  precodeINSERT INTO ... VALUES 1,2,3  SELECT ... FROM TABLE WHERE ID1 AND NAME2 codepre  pNow NHibernate uses a p0,p1,... format for bind variables which gives a invalid program bind variable SQL exception in SQLBase.p  pThe problem is the p before the number, and also that the parameters start at 0  SQLBase must have parameters starting with 1.p  pIs there any way I can configurechange NHibernate to drop the p in the bind variables, and also start with 1 instead of 0 I was able to change the format of the parameters for INSERTs, UPDATEs and DELETEs with sqlinsert, sqlupdate and sqldelete mappings in my class mappings, but the only way I found to change the SELECT parameters was to write lots of named queries into my mappings.p  pObviously this isnt the preferred way.

Negative 6621 pI would like to debate if PlayORMs virtual partitioning is the best way to partition data always, as compared to Cassandras partitioning.p  pSchema p  ul liTimeStampli liDevice IDli liDevice Nameli liDevice Ownerli ul  pFor a TimeStamp, there are 500 K rows, and for a particular Device ID, there are 10 K rowsp  pIf I want to partition on 2 columns, say TimeStamp and Device ID. I have following ways this could be donep  ol liUse PlayORM to virtual partition on both columns, such that data for any virtual partition by any column is distributed on all nodes.li liUse Cassandras built in partitioning support for one of the columns, and use PlayORMs approach to create virtual partitioning on other columns.li ol  pIf Device ID was partitioned the Cassandra way, then all the records for a particular Device ID will be stored in disk at contiguous location, and one could carry on with virtual partitioning approach for TimeStamp as playorm does. The reason I may prefer this over PlayORMs approach is that with Cassandras partition approach, all records of a particular Device ID can be fetched fast if they are in physically contiguous locations on disk, since they are less in numbers 10K only. This may be better than PlayORMs all out approach to distribute records for all partition evenly on nodes, since then the data would be randomly distributed on disk, resulting in many disk seeks, and obviously that would slow things down. So even though in PlayORMs approach, we are doing divide and conquer kind of solution by dividing the rows among nodes in cluster, the speedup due to divide and conquer may be offset by high disk seeks because rows could be randomly scattered all over the node as against Cassandras partition, where it would be all together.p  pDoes the above seem to be a valid point, or is there some fault in my understandingp

Negative 6621 pI am practicing some webapps technology. I setup Apache HTTP server which provides HTTP page with JNLPFlashFX file with simple dataform to fill by the user. My first idea was to sendreceive the data from JNLP with help of UDP I just serialize object inside datagrams. To be more specificp  ul liApache provides a static HTTP and JNLPFlashFX HTTP is just to deploy JNLPli liJNLP communicates via UDP with serverli liserver runs simple Java program to sendreceive UDP packets to JNLPli ul  pMy problem is when I access the page from client browser machine a firewall asking if I want to allowdeny the access to network from java. No doubts this is normal, but I think no one is expecting this from a web page....  I want to change this approach and use existing HTTP protocol.p  pQUESTION UPDATEp  pAs far as I understood with HTTP protocol we have couple of methods which are used to communicate with the server GET, PUT, POST ....  and provided by Apache service.p  pI would like to use this for data exchange like thisp  ul liJNLP sends some serialized data with HTTP methodsli liApache will redirect some or full traffic to my Java programli liMy Java program will answers via Apache to my JNLPli ul  pHow can I do thatp

Negative 6621 pI have a scrollable listview that has 2 textViews, 3 imageButtons and 1 checkBox in each row.p  pIn the Header of the listView, I have a delete button just above the column containing all the checkboxes of the listView.p  pI have to perform the delete operation of objects in the listView when 2 or more checkBoxes are checked randomly by scrolling the listView and thereafter the delete button at the top is clicked.p  pBut the problem is that i am not getting the correct poition of the checkbox that was selected. Moreover, sometimes i get the correct position but still the object to be deleted passed is wrong. Hence the entire functionality is affected maybe due to the scrolling nature of the list.p  pShould i take the position in the holder of the adapter class and also bind the state of the checked or unchecked checkbox with my object. p  pAnd should I use checkBox.setOnCheckedChangeListener or deleteButton.setOnClickListener. If i use the latter one, then how to get all the corresponding objects of the list whose checkboxes were checked before pressing the delete button And where should all the related code be placed..in the listAdapter class or in the activityp  pPlease help me find a solution to this problem..p

Am using a hrefhttpwww.ruddwire.comhandycodedatetomillisecondcalculators relnofollowhttpwww.ruddwire.comhandycodedatetomillisecondcalculatorsa for  I used this code assuming getTime will have a consistent UTC timep  precode dateStr is what user enters on UI like 1082013 format  ddMMyyyy public static long getUTCDateWithFormatString dateStr, String format throws ParseException      SimpleDateFormat sdf  new SimpleDateFormatformat     Date date  sdf.parsedateStr     return date.getTime  codepre  pSo considering start time, when I run from localhost, For August 1, I got result     1375295400000, which means Thu Aug 01 2013 000000 GMT0530 India Standard Time. So I understand there is a 5 hrs 30mins milliseconds to be subtracted from the UTC since at runtime I have to compare system time with this value.p  pExpected similar UTC to be saved when run from server US, but it saved 1375336800000 which means Thu Aug 01 2013 113000 GMT0530 India Standard Time so UTC time is different and there is 1130 hours flaw in addition to 530 hrs flaw.p  pDid not use the following code on the server but I expect similar results p  precodeCalendar calendar  Calendar.getInstance String[] arr  dateStr.split calendar.setnew Integerarr[2], new Integerarr[0], new Integer         arr[1] return calendar.getTime codepre  pKindly help me resolve this problem. Also while doing comparison at runtime I have to use new Date so how should that bep
Negative 6621 pIs there a way to create parentless widgets in Glade What I mean is, for example, a table with no associated parent, so that I can assign it as a child of something else later.p  pWhat Im trying to do is a GTK window with a 3 positions VBox, 2 of which will be static and 1 which will be dynamic. In this dynamic position I want to load a predefined table which will vary according to whatever I did in the static parts, like pressing X or Y buttons.p  pIs this possible, or do I have to create the dynamic table by codep  pIm using Ruby 1.9.3, Gtk2, and Glade3. Thanks.p  pEdit I tried creating a separate window with the tables and loading one of these tables into the intended window. I got an error, apparently a ChildParent missmatch GtkCRITICAL gtkboxpack assertion childparent  NULL failedp

Negative 6621 pIm not sure if its OK to do this, but this question has to do with a source which I stumbled upon when doing some research and which I think is incorrect, and I hoped I could discuss this here. On a hrefhttpwww.redgate.comproductsdotnetdevelopmentantsmemoryprofilerlearningmemorymanagementWPFsilverlightpitfalls relnofollowhttpwww.redgate.comproductsdotnetdevelopmentantsmemoryprofilerlearningmemorymanagementWPFsilverlightpitfallsa, Chris Farrell states that the following would lead to a memory leakp  precode... Order newOrder  new OrderEURUSD, ...  newOrder.OnPlaced  OrderPlaced mPendingDeals.AddnewOrder ... void OrderPlacedOrder placedOrder    mPendingDeals.RemoveplacedOrder  codepre  pThe following is being statedp  blockquote   pThe OrderPlaced event handler still holds a reference to the Order   object from when we subscribed to the OnPlaced event, and that   reference will keep the Order object alive even though we have removed   it from the collection. Its so easy to make this mistake.p blockquote  pIs this explanation correct p  pI would say it is not as far as I see it, its the event notifyer that keeps a reference to the event subscribers function pointer and thus the event subscriber, not the other way around. In this case, it is the Order that keeps a reference to the handling class, and when that Order is removed, it will actually be cleared correctly from memory, assuming there are no other references to that Order.

Negative 6621 pTo help a user that may leave a form open until the session times out I am trying to resubmit their form after they have been sent through the login page and redirected back to the form.

Negative 6621 pI am looking at utilizing a Google api for some functionality in an Android app and as such, users will require a Google account. I will need to create a new account within the app as other users should not be aware of the users info for privacy reasons, so using an existing account is probably not advisable. Wondering if its possible to hide newly generated accounts  from the AccountManager so the user cannot mistakenly start using the account created in the app for sending emails or any other tasks from this account. Also wondering if its possible to run a session in a browser specific to one Google account while keeping other accounts logged in in other sessions. Sorry if this is a totally unrealistic question. p

Negative 6621 pHow can I exempt a single row in a DataTables.js table from DataTables builtin filtering, so thta it is always shownp  pstrongBackgroundstrong Im building a table editing component using the jQuerybased a hrefhttpdatatables.net relnofollowDataTables.jsa library. Instead of using dialogs or overlays, I wanted to present editing controls right within the datatable, like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comqJeZe.png altenter image description herep  pThis works like a charm, even with active filters I keep the original, unchanged data in the record while it is being edited, so I can use that data for the codesortcode and codefiltercode modes of codemDataPropcode, and my row stays in place and visible until editing is finished.p  pA bigger problem arises when I add a new row There is no data to use for filtering, so if a filter is active, my row wont be visible. This breaks the workflow where the user searches through the dataset, sees that some record is missing, and without clearing the filter presses the Add button, waiting for an empty row with edit controls to appearp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comUHmi7.png altenter image description herep  pHow can I exempt this special row from DataTables filteringp

Negative 6621 pI have a really strange issue. I have a pager with fragments. One of the fragments is the Messages fragment. In this fragment I have a FragmentTabHost with three tabfragments.

Negative 6621 pcodeAffinecode class made as extending codeTransformcode class in codeJavaFXcode.p  pThis makes an illusion, that there can be some types of transforms, other than affine.p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pIn codeJavaFX 2.xcode a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavafx2apijavafxscenetransformTransform.html relnofollowcodeTransformcodea class contains only getters for specific matrix elements, which includes 12 elements of 3x4 matrix for 3D affine transform. Any class usage can rely only on these elements, so any represented transformation is affine.p  pThis means that 2.x version has bad design, because basic class can represent only affine transforms, while codeAffinecode is made its subclass. This is wrong, since codeAffinecode should be made basic class.p  pIn codeJavaFX 8code a hrefhttpdownload.java.netjdk8jfxdocsjavafxscenetransformTransform.html relnofollowcodeTransformcodea class has better design. Additionally to getters, it has indexed access to matrix elements and determination of a hrefhttpdownload.java.netjdk8jfxdocsjavafxscenetransformMatrixType.html relnofollowmatrix typea. Also it has codetransformcode methods, which do actual transformation.p  pThis means, that usage can rely both on codetransformcode methods, or on matrix element getters.p  pIf it can be guaranteed, that all internal parts of codeJavaFXcode rely on codetransformcode methods, then this class can be extended and perspective transformation can be implemented. May be it even can be implemented in release version of codeJavaFX8code.p  pThe question is can it be guaranteed, that codeJavaFXcode relies only on codetransformcode methodsp

Negative 6621 pI have already linked the necessary jar file to the project that Im building right now. But when I tried to call methods supported by that .jar library, Eclipse told me that this method cant be resolved. Now what should I do p  pIs there any syntax, such as import xxx.jar that I have to add to the source to make it workp  pAgain, sorry I am sort of new to java. I could easily do that on linux with a tag but cant see how to accomplish the same thing with eclipse. I know it is confusing without pictures but Im not allowed to post any since I just registered.p

Negative 6621 pIve got a question which i have solved and many other similar ones which i have successfully completed as part of my assignment. I am having a little confusion with one of the question which is...p  pThe decimal number 256 is held in a 9 bit memory location. represent this in sign and magnitude.p  pthe answer that i got is... 11 0000 0000 p  phow i got this is by doing the followingp  pWe first show the binary form and then invert the most significant bit the bit on the far left. O represents a positive value and 1 represents a negative value the sign determines whether it is a positive or negative value and the magnitude is the total of the numbers or total of bits etc.   p  pNotice that Ive added an extra bit to show the representation of 256 in sign and magnitude. This is simply because 9 bits are not enough to show whether 256 is negative or positive as it maxed out. The total of 9 bits gave the magnitude which is 256 and the 10th bit on the far left shows the sign which is 1 and this shows that it is a negative 256.p  pWhat i find confusing is that the decimal 256 was held in a 9 bit memory location and the result i got was 1 0000 0000. i have added an extra bit to show that the number is negative which then represents it in 10 bit. I am having difficulty with how i can represent 256 in sign and magnitude using only 9 bit. it seems impossible to show in 9 bit and i have therefore used 10 bit but i am only allowed to use 9 bits. could someone help with how this could be achieved. your help will be greatly appreciated. I am just a bit stuck with this. My tutors expect us to use the internet or self knowledge and would not give us even a clue. so thats why i am here.p

Negative 6621 pSay my Git repository has the branches codemastercode, codeBranchAcode, codeBranchBcode, and codeBranchCcode.p  pNow all of these branches have been merged into master, possibly multiple times for whatever reason, its a hypothetical scenario.  I want to be able to find all of the merge commits where codeBranchAcode was merged into codemastercode.p  pHere is as far as I got before asking this questionp  precodegit log master BranchA merges oneline codepre  pThis gets me all of the commits that are in codemastercode and not codeBranchAcode that are also merge commits.  This actually gives me all of the commits I am looking for, but it can also give me commits I do not want, such as merges from codeBranchBcode and codeBranchCcode into master.p  pExample outputp  precode10bdc8b Merge branch BranchA 383693a Merge branch BranchB 8af3b5c Merge branch master of 192.168.0.0pathtorepo.git aa0f22c Merge branch master into BranchC 72bbf3a Merge branch BranchA fac1157 Merge branch BranchB codepre  pI would like to find a solution that outputs just the code10bdc8bcode and code72bbf3acode. And dont just grep for the name BranchA I know that would work in this case, but it is always possible that the merge commit could be given a custom message, so it may not always work.p  hr  pstrongEditstrongp  pGood responses so far, but unfortunately, I have hit a wall that I dont know how to get past.  Consider the following scenariop  precode   F                               ltBranchB                          ABCDEKL    ltmaster                                                               GHIJ       ltBranchA codepre  pNow, my goal here is to find all the merge commits from BranchA to master.  By looking at the graph, I can see that I am looking for codeLcode and codeDcode.  The curve ball that is keeping me from figuring this out programmatically however, is the merge commit codeIcode where master is merged into BranchA.p  pIn this scenario, if we use the codebranch containscode method on all commits in master, we get codeLcode,codeDcode,and codeBcode. However, if we do branch contains on all commits in master and not in BranchA, we get only codeLcode.  Neither approach gets the desired output.p  pSimilarly, if we use codegit mergebasecode to find the parent, we get only codeLcode.p  pAs far as I can tell, there does not seem to be a good way to separate codeBcode and codeDcode, since both commits are in the history of BranchA.  I can tell by looking at them that they are different, but Git does not seem to have a good way to distinguish them.p

Negative 6621 pI cant seem to get JQuery custom events to work as advertised when the trigger is emnotem bound to a specific DOM element. I am trying to understand how to implement a modelviewcontroller pattern in which the model has absolutely no DOMrelated code, yet triggers custom events for the view. p  pThe models setValue method triggers a custom ValueChanged event using .event.trigger. p  pIn the view, on is used to bind both a keyup and the custom ValueChanged event to an input element. The keyup handler calls the models setValue method, but the input elements ValueChanged handler never gets called. p  pI can bind the document to handle the ValueChanged, but that handler has no reference to the input  it also gets called twice. I would really like the input elements handler to be called so I get a reference to the input element.p  pIn the code example I show two Views that get created by the document.ready function, but ideally I would like to be able to generate additional views programmatically this is just an example of the problem.p  pMore than likely the problem is with my misunderstanding of some crucial concept.p  pAny help would be much appreciated.p  precodelthtmlgt ltheadgt ltscript srcjquery1.10.2.jsgtltscriptgt ltscriptgt function Model value     this.value  value  Model.prototype.setValue  function value     console.logModel.setValue , value     oldValue  this.value     this.value  value     .event.trigger         type ValueChanged,         oldValue oldValue,         newValue this.value       Model.prototype.getValue  function      return this.value   function View container, model     iftypeof container  string         this.container  document.getElementByIdcontainer     else         this.container  container     this.input  document.createElementinput     this.input.model  model     this.container.appendChildthis.input     this.span  document.createElementspan     this.span.textinitial value     this.container.appendChildthis.span      set the input component to show the number     this.input.valthis.input.model.getValue     ref  this       this one gets called twice     document.onValueChanged, function e         console.logValueChanged document   e.newValue     e.target            this one never gets called     this.input.onValueChanged, function e         console.logValueChanged input   e.newValue          set the input component to show the number         ref.span.texte.newValue           this.input.onkeyup, functione          if e.which  13  e.keyCode  13              set the new value in the model this is the input component that got the keyup event             this.model.setValuethis.value             e.preventDefault                     document.readyfunction      view1  new Viewcontainer1, new Model1     view2  new Viewcontainer2, new Model2     console.logview1.input.model.value   view1.input.model.getValue  ,     view2.input.model.value   view2.input.model.getValue     console.logview1.input.value   view1.input.value  , view2.input.value   view2.input.value  ltscriptgt ltheadgt ltbodygt ltdiv idcontainer1gt ltdivgt ltdiv idcontainer2gt ltdivgt ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pI have arrived at a solution with the correct behavior, shown below, but it requires the Model to keep an array of the Views and also each View must call the models attachView method p  pThis version also shows multiple views for the same model, which is an important feature of modelviewcontroller.p  pIs there any way to achieve the same result but without the Model needing emanyem information about the Viewsp  pThanksp  precodelthtmlgt ltheadgt ltscript srcjquery1.10.2.jsgtltscriptgt ltscriptgt  function Model value     this.value  value     this.views  []  Model.prototype.attachView  function view     this.views.pushview  Model.prototype.setValue  function value     console.logModel.setValue , value     oldValue  this.value     this.value  value     forvar i  0 i lt this.views.length i     this.views[i].trigger         type ValueChanged,         oldValue oldValue,         newValue this.value                Model.prototype.getValue  function      return this.value   function View container, model     this.container  document.getElementByIdcontainer     this.input  document.createElementinput     this.input.model  model     model.attachViewthis     this.container.appendChildthis.input     this.span  document.createElementspan     this.span.textinitial value     this.container.appendChildthis.span      set the input component to show the models number     this.input.valthis.input.model.getValue      this.onValueChanged, function e         console.logValueChanged   e.newValue          set the span to show the number         this.span.texte.newValue           this.input.onkeyup, functione          if e.which  13  e.keyCode  13              set the new value in the model this is the input component that got the keyup event             this.model.setValuethis.value                     document.readyfunction      view1  new Viewcontainer1, new Model1     var model2  new Model2     view2  new Viewcontainer2, model2     view3  new Viewcontainer3, model2     console.logview1.input.model.value   view1.input.model.getValue  , view2.input.model.value   view2.input.model.getValue     console.logview1.input.value   view1.input.value  , view2.input.value           view2.input.value  ltscriptgt ltheadgt ltbodygt ltdiv idcontainer1 gt ltdiv idcontainer2 gt ltdiv idcontainer3 gt ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre

The PHP file will                                  retrieve the data from the database mysql  , and convert the strings into JSon objects. Then my javacode will call the json class and list the data. I can successfully insert the data to the mysql.Am using PHP and JSON parsing for it.When the data inserted into database, the next activity should be listing the data.The problem is no data is coming into my listing activity. only the Activity is coming without data. kindly help me .

In else method i put the code for get method . i converted it into json object , and the above android code will call it and display it in the activity..

The image is displayed, and when I go in and inspect the element using Chrome or Firefox, I can see that the Expires header is set correctly when I change it and force a hard reload, it resets it appropriately.

Ive tried using the following, all to no availp  precodeheaders[CacheControl]  public, maxage300  Original setting headers[cachecontrol]  public, maxage300  Casesensitive headers[CacheControl]  maxage300 headers[CacheControl]  private, maxage300 headers[CacheControl]  maxage300, public headers[CacheControl]  maxage300, private codepre  pBut like I said, no matter what I set it to, it emalwaysem returns a response header showing CacheControl nocache, private.p  pWhat am I doing wrong  How can I get my image and binary files returned via this controller to cache  Has Laravel 4 for some reason hardcoded the CacheControl header in all responsesp

Negative 6621 pI realize this question has been asked before but I didnt find any answers that actually resolved it, so...asking again.p  pIm using ARC. My app takes photos from an AVCaptureSession at periodic intervals and saves them to core data. I get the NSData object by calling UIImagePNGRepresentation. As this is happening, memory steadily climbs and the app eventually quits due to memory pressure...but there are no leaks. Instruments shows that for each photo, 500k is being malloced and it never gets released.p  pThe answer I keep coming across is to wrap UIImagePNGRepresentation, or indeed the whole method body, in an autoreleasepool, but this did not help.p  pI am reasonably certain that the UIImagePNGRepresentation call is the culprit, because when I comment it out, no more memory problems or images to save.p  pWould appreciate any help here...is there another way to grab NSData from a UIImage Is this just another SDK bug we have to live withp  precodevoidphotoTimerFiredNSTimertimer   ...

Negative 6621 pI am using a codeUICollectionViewcode to display players in various positions on a field.  Each cell contains labels showing the players name and the position name. The locations in the view are determined by a custom layout that reads the position information from the data source... i.e. the location on the field has nothing to do with the index in the data source, as in a flow layout.  The cells are also a bit different for various positions... cellForItemAtIndexPath selects from various reuse identifiers depending on the position.p  pI want the user to be able to swap players in positions.  Everything works perfectly as long as I just update the collection view data source and call code[self.collectionView reloadData]code.  But I want to animate the swap of cells, so the user can see the change.  Im using this code, where the inboundSourceIndex and outboundSourceIndex have been previously set to the items that are swappingp  precode[self.collectionView performBatchUpdates     [self.collectionView moveItemAtIndexPathinboundOriginIndex toIndexPathoutboundOriginIndex]     [self.collectionView moveItemAtIndexPathoutboundOriginIndex toIndexPathinboundOriginIndex]      completionnil]  [self assignmentsUpdate]  This method updates the data source for the collection view [self.collectionView.collectionViewLayout invalidateLayout] [self.collectionView reloadData] codepre  pAfter I insert the batch update, I get the desired animation of the cells appearing to swap with each other, the player name labels show correctly, and the layout is providing the right frames for the cells which can vary.  But all else is chaos the position labels dont update, and the cells are not reloading with their correct reuse identifiersits like the collectionView isnt really calling codecellForItemAtIndexPathcode.  Ive tried changing the order of the data update and the reloadData, to no avail.  I can see how moving cells might alter the indexPaths temporarily, but how can the collectionView look wrong after I call codeinvalidateLayoutcode and codereloadDatacode  Doesnt that build the view from scratch based on the data sourcep
Negative 6621 pI have shipped an online gridbased videogame that uses the TCP protocol to ensure reliable communication in a serverclient network topology. My game works fairly well, but suffers from higher than expected latency similar TCP games in the genre seem to do a better job at keeping latency to a minimal. p  pWhile investigating, I discovered that the latency is only unexpectedly high for clients running emMicrosoft Windowsem as opposed to emMac OS Xem clients. Furthermore, I discovered that if a Windows client sets a hrefhttplifeandcode.net200905reducegamenetworklatencyinwindows7orvistacodeTcpAckFrequency1code in the registrya and restarts their machine, their latency becomes normal.p  pIt would appear that my network design did not take into account delayed acknowledgementp  blockquote   pA design that does not take into account the interaction of strongdelayed acknowledgmentstrong, the Nagle algorithm, and Winsock buffering can drastically effect performance.   a hrefhttpsupport.microsoft.comkb214397httpsupport.microsoft.comkb214397ap blockquote  pHowever, Im finding it nearly impossible to take into account delayed acknowledgement in my game or any game. According to MSDN, the Microsoft TCP stack uses the following criteria to decide when to send one ACK on received data packetsp  blockquote   ul   liIf the second data packet is received before the delay timer expires 200ms, the ACK is sent.li   liIf there are data to be sent in the same direction as the ACK before the second data packet is received and the delay timer expires,   the ACK is piggybacked with the data segment and sent immediately.li   liWhen the delay timer expires 200ms, the ACK is sent.li   ul      pa hrefhttpsupport.microsoft.comkb214397httpsupport.microsoft.comkb214397ap blockquote  pReading this, one would presume that the workaround for delayed acknowledgement on Microsofts TCP stack is as followsp  ol liDisable the Nagle algorithm TCPNODELAY.li liDisable the sockets send buffer codeSOSNDBUFcode0, so that a call to codesendcode can be expected to send a packet.li liWhen calling codesendcode, if no further data is expected to be sent immediately, call codesendcode again with a singlebyte of data that will be discarded by the receiver.li ol  pWith this approach, the second data packet will be received by the receiver at around the same time as the previous data packet. As a result, the codeACKcode should get sent immediately from the receiver to the sender emulating what codeTcpAckFrequency1code does in the registry.p  pHowever, from my testing, this improved latency only by about a half of what the registry edit does. What am I missingp  phr bQ Why not use UDPbp  pbAb I chose TCP because every packet I send needs to arrive and be in order there are no packets that arnt worth retransmitting if they get lost or become unordered.

Negative 6621 pRight now I have a CountDownTimer that ticks like thisp  precodeMyTimer60000, 1 codepre  pSo it ticks down 60 seconds with an interval of 1ms. I am signaling bpms in my timer. p  pThis is done by dividing every minute by a bpmnumberp  precodepublic void onTicklong millisLeft      if TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS.toSecondsmillisLeft  60  bpm  0       doSignal       codepre  pThis works great, but ONLY if the timer is set to interval 1000p  precodeMyTimer60000, 1000 codepre  pThat means it will tick once every second every 1000ms. But I need it to tick at 1ms. p  pThe problem with my condition is that if the timer ticks at an interval of 1ms. It will start the signal when supposed to  but repeat rapidly.p  pIf interval is 1000ms and bpm is set to 20, it will beep every third second 6020  3. If the interval is set to 1ms, it will start beeping every third second  and beep repeatedly through that second. p  pSo somehow my condition is true within a larger span than I intended with 1ms ticker interval. p  pstrongHow do I design my condition so it will fire only once every 60  bpm seconds with the timer at an interval of 1msstrongp

Negative 6621 pI have an app that serves up many complex JSON pieces. Some of these could hit the database 1000 times. I precache the results in our db such that when we change the underlying data we regenerate the JSON frag which then gets stored in the DB. I am using Sidekiq to manage this. One issue is that if I put this cache killing code into a Rails Model callback, I could potentially get multiple copies of the worker request at once. This is obviously not what I want. Is there a way in Sidekiq to say only add this to queue if it currently is not in the queue p  pHeres an example of what Im doingp  precodeclass ArcBackground   include SidekiqWorker   def performid     Menu.regenerateMenuJSONid     Menu.regenerateMenuJSONFullid   end end codepre

Negative 6621 pIm slowly moving a legacy FileMaker application to Rails 4.1. To do that Im in the process of creating a simple Rails JSON API to keep the FileMaker application which is still being used and Rails data in sync.p  pTo simplify things Id like to make use of nested JSON resources where possible  e.g. Creating  updating a contact should automatically include its addresses and other data from related tables. Otherwise Id have to jump to related records in FileMaker and initialize separate API requests, which is a rather slow process in FileMaker. Handling this in one request is prefered.p  pOf course its important to keep the IDs of those existing FileMaker records, which is why they have to be set in those API requests. However it turns out that nested resources in JSON requests that have an ID set automatically trigger an update action for those nested models. Lets look at an example like this small piece of JSONp  precode     id 7777     name John Doe     addresses [              id 123,         name John Doe,         address Some Street 12         city Sampletown         ...     ,          id 654,         name Jane Doe,         address Some other address         city Maybe in another city         ...     ]  codepre  pIf I wanted to push this contact and its addresses from FileMaker to Rails via API request Rails will look for existing addresses with the IDs of 123 and 654 instead of creating new ones with those IDs.p  pI know this intended by Rails and if I wanted those addresses to be created Id have to post them without IDs, but as mentioned before its important to keep the IDs since they are used for all kinds of relations within the application like order billing and delivery addresses. This behaviour also only seems to apply to nested data. The parent object can be created just fine with any ID.p  pOf course I could just post addresses as first level parent objects in several requests but that would require a lot of jumping around in FileMaker, so if anyone is aware of a way to avoid the default Rails behaviour when it comes to post requests and nested attributes with a fixed ID, Id be glad to hear it.p
Negative 6621 pIs there any way to inherit a session into webdriver I did lot of search and know it that selenium does not support connecting to already opened browser. It would be better if i could. But now I have thought about some work around. Actually my application starts with a shortcut file which launch firefox, hit the application URL, made the log in, go to the dashboard and leave for the user to use it. In that case i do not need to work on that opened browser, if i can get that active session only and set it while opening the webdriver with selenium then my purpose is solved. Even its possible manually also. As selenium always open incognito webdriver window, i am unable to get that session there. Can any one tell me how to get that session from already opened browser and use it in webdriver Any help or suggestion would be highly appreciated.p

All the apps including the shell app would reside on the same host. br Since coming from the Flex dev background, the closest example I can share is one swf loading the other swf. br Thanks in advance and any help is appreciated.p

Negative 6621 pI had criticized a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma24343493607407an answera that suggested codepregmatchcode over codecode when finding substring offsets in order to avoid type mismatch.p  pHowever, later on the answers author has discovered that codepregmatchcode is actually emsignificantlyem faster than multibyte operating codembstrposcode. Normal codestrposcode is faster than both functions but of course, cannot deal with multibyte strings.p  pI understand that codembstrposcode needs to do emsomething moreem than codestrposcode. However, if regex can do it emalmost as fastem as codestrposcode, what is it that codembstrposcode does that takes so much time  p  pI have strong suspicion that its an optimization error.

This works properly with both devices and android versions.p  pstrongInitialization in Support V4 Fragmentstrongp  precodepublic View onCreateViewLayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container,  Bundle savedInstanceState   View view  inflater.inflateR.layout.fragmentlayout, container, false   initUiReferencesview   return view   Override public void onCreateOptionsMenuMenu menu, MenuInflater inflater   inflater.inflateR.menu.fragmentmenu, menu  super.onCreateOptionsMenumenu, inflater  codepre  pBut now im facing the problem that i can not find the reference to an action bar item using findViewById on Android Kitkat. On Android Ice Cream Sandwich this call returns the correct view of the action item, but on KitKat it returns null.p  pAny Suggestions. Thanks in Advancep  pstrongEditstrong This is the initUiReferences. It only initializes a list view within the fragment.p  precodeprivate void initUiReferencesViewView view   mListView  ListView view.findViewByIdR.id.listview  mListView...    This call always returns null on Kitkat  View actionItem  view.findViewByIdR.id.actionitem  codepre  pCalling findViewById on fragment elements works without any problem, but when i try to find an action bar item it returns null. I tried it also to find the reference in codeonResumecode or codeonViewCreatedcode, but it doesnt solve the problem. The action bar item is shown on the display and works properly.p

Negative 6621 pI just finished my program an dam having to submit it on the UNIX systems per my professors instructions. However, my program writes data to a file prog6.out which is a binary file. I need to submit this file along with the rest of my program files, however I get a message that it is a binary file and cannot be submitted. Is there any way I can work around this to submit my file on the UNIX systemp  pMy program is supposed to read in input from a file named prog6.dat, perform some calculations on that data in order to create triangle objects, then write the final information to a file prog6.out as per my professors instructions. The contents of this file include 5 triangle objects each of which include the lengths of the three sides, the area, perimeter, color, and whether it is filled or not. I had asked in a previous question earlier about why when opening my prog6.out file all I see is random numbers, symbols, etc and was told that since it was a binary file, that was correct. If you need to see specific code let me know, theres just a lot of it and thought maybe this question could be answered without making yall muddle through 4 classes worth of code ha. p

Negative 6621 pIm using OpenGL to draw a screen size quad to the same position with low alpha lesser than 0.1 on every frame, without glClearGLCOLORBUFFERBIT between them. This way the quad should increasingly damp the visibility of the drawings of the previous frames. However the damping effect stops after some seconds. If I use alpha value no lower than 0.1 for the quad, it works as expected. It seems to me, that the OpenGL blending equation fails after a number of iterations higher alpha values need less iteration to accumulate to 1, so if alpha 0.1 the problem doesnt occur. The lower limit of the alpha in 8bit is about 0.0039 1255, so alpha 0.01 should be fine.p  pI have tried several blending settings, using the following render methodp  precodeglEnableGLBLEND glBlendFuncGLSRCALPHA, GLONEMINUSSRCALPHA glClearGLDEPTHBUFFERBIT  draw black quad with translucency using glDrawArrays codepre  pAnd the simple fragment shaderp  precodeversion 450  uniform vec4 Color out vec4 FragColor  void main      FragColor  Color  codepre  pHow could I fix this issuep

Negative 6621 pI was trying to write around em5 billion line to a fileem using python. I have noticed that the performance of the writes are getting worse as the file is getting bigger.p  pFor example at the beginning I was writing 10 million lines per second, after 3 billion lines, it writes 10 times slower than before.p  pI was wondering if this is actually related to the size of the filep  pThat is, do you think that the performance is getting better if I break this big file into the smaller ones or the size of the file does not affect the performance of the writes.p  pIf you think it affects the performance can you please explain whyp  pSome more info p  pThe memory consumption is the same 1.3 all the time. The length of the lines are the same. So the logic is that I read one line from a file lets call it file A. each line of the file A contains 2 tab separated value, if one of the values has some specific characteristics I add the same line to file B. This operation is O1, I just convert the value to int and check if that value  someNumber is any of the 7 flags that I want.p  pEvery time I read 10M lines from file A I output the line number. Thats how I know the the performance dropped. File B is the one which gets bigger and bigger and the writes to it gets slower.p  pThe OS is Ubuntu.p

Negative 6621 pI understand this question has been discussed a couple of times in the site. However seems not getting the answer or inspiration I am looking for.p  pSo lets say we have a web application. The question is, how to convey info that we dont want filling up the screen all the time and yet needs to be available when desired.  Hover text was good for that, but only works well when theres a mouse involved. Now we need to support this web application to run reasonably well on a couple of targeted tabletsbrowser combination including iPad, Andriod Samsung and more. p  pTo throw a wrench in, sometimes the elements are not only hoverenabled to display additional dynamic content, but also clickable to trigger a primary actionsuch as going to another page. The real estate is very limited, so adding an info icon is not an option. The fact that the tooltip content is dynamic also rules out the option of graph legend. p  pTo give a concrete example, here is a calender widget. The way it works with a mouse is, when mouseover 11242014, hover text will tell it is thanksgiving and other info. Now when end user clicks it, end user will be navigate to another page. It works fine with a mouse, but not so well with touch.  p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comUufsA.png altenter image description here The question becomes, Hypothetically, if we had designed these screens with tablets in mind, what might we have done differently so that we didnt even rely on hover text  Might we have done something that works the same for both touch and mouse It does not have to be hover to bring up tooltip, then what options do we have p

So now I was wondering if it is possible to use certain variables from a site and add them in your Android app.p  pSo if the variable changes on the site that they instantly will change in my App. p  pIf this is possible could somebody please explain me how to do this and if it is not possible just comment a no.p  pThank you.p

Negative 6621 pIm currently dealing with depth images retrieved from a kinect sensor that have been saved as 16 bit grayscale PNGs. At the moment Im just loading these images using the imread function with the CVLOADIMAGEGRAYSCALE flag and everything works fine. The reason why Im doing this is because some OpenCV functions rely on the input being 8 bit.p  pHere is the problem The next step is to use the depth frames captured by the sensor, which come as 16 bit, directly. I though it would be sufficient to scale and convert the values using covertTodst, CV8U, 1.0256.0 but for some reason the resulting image looks very different from the ones loaded as 8 bit So, how does OpenCV convert the image when loaded as 8 bit.p  pHere is the a hrefhttpsdrive.google.comfiled0Bqt8lafqDaeTld4SkJjYWJpQ1kviewuspsharing relnofollowimagea I used for a test and here is some code that shows the problemp  precodeint mainint argc, char argv[]      Mat depth8  imreadargv[1], CVLOADIMAGEGRAYSCALE     Mat depth16  imreadargv[1], CVLOADIMAGEANYDEPTH      depth16.convertTodepth16, CV8U, 1.0256.0      Mat diff     absdiffdepth8, depth16, diff      imshowdepth8, depth8255.016.0     imshowdepth16, depth16255.016.0     imshowdiff, diff gt 0     waitKey0      return 0  codepre  pThe output of the code can be found a hrefhttpsdrive.google.comfiled0Bqt8lafqDaeWF9iQ2RydEgtVE0viewuspsharing relnofollowherea.p  pI case you wonder why the test image is so dark, it is because the maximum value for 16 bit is so much larger than the values produced by kinect up to around 4000.p  pAnother thing The image loaded as 8 bit seems to be much better than the converted one. If you comment in the two lines you can see what I mean. p  pSo again How is OpenCV doing its conversionp  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 6621 pI am developing mobile application that simply acts as another access point for dealing with a web application.  it uses the native interface of android and makes some calls to the remote server for synchronizing data  and keeps some user oriented data on the local sqlite3 database.p  pIn one of mine activities , the data populated in the spinnersnot too much data should be loaded from the database  the reason for that is that this data  has to be configurable in the main web application administration part by wish of the web application   and its not appropriate to put the data in the usual string.xml string bundle.p  pI also want to be able to again load the data , when the user is changing the local  currently thinking of only two languages to support .p  pI have searched and read , may be too many articles and got really confused and thats why I am asking this question.  I have read that using loader , that not using the CursorLoader implementation is pretty painful  refering to the LoaderEx project of CommonsWare and their comments for Loaders framework and given the fact that  the usage of Content Providers for me is unnecessary , because I dont intentd to share that database with other applications and is unnecessary boiler plate code around my app  . p  pI want my code be working handling orientation changes and of course the activities and fragments lifescycle. We have decided also to use the Roboguice library for dependancy injection.p  pAt least from what Ive read the Robospice project is primarily purpose for asynchronios operations that query a remote server , for an example through a REST servives, so thats not an option for me either.p  pCan you provide me with some guidelinesp

At the same time, Id like to return these objects from a function and would prefer to use the RVO.  Now, I dont really want to have to remember all of the nuances of the RVO when coding and when its applied an when its not applied.  Mostly, I want the object to be returned and I dont want the copy constructor called.  Certainly, the RVO is better, but the move semantics are fine.  Is there a way to the RVO when possible and the move semantics when notp  hr  h2Edit 1h2  pThe following a hrefhttpsstackoverflow.comquestions11914691copyelisionmoveconstructornotcalledwhenusingternaryexpressioninreturquestiona helped me figure out whats going on.  Basically, 12.8.32 of the standard statesp  blockquote   pWhen the criteria for elision of a copy operation are met or would be   met save for the fact that the source object is a function parameter,   and the object to be copied is designated by an lvalue, overload   resolution to select the constructor for the copy is first performed   as if the object were designated by an rvalue. If overload resolution   fails, or if the type of the first parameter of the selected   constructor is not an rvalue reference to the objects type possibly   cvqualified, overload resolution is performed again, considering the   object as an lvalue. [ Note This twostage overload resolution must   be performed regardless of whether copy elision will occur. It   determines the constructor to be called if elision is not performed,   and the selected constructor must be accessible even if the call is   elided. end note ]p blockquote  pAlright, so to figure out what the criteria for a copy elison are, we look at 12.8.31p  blockquote   pin a return statement in a function with a class return type, when the   expression is the name of a nonvolatile automatic object other than   a function or catchclause parameter with the same cvunqualified type   as the function return type, the copymove operation can be omitted by   constructing the automatic object directly into the functions return   valuep blockquote  pAs such, if we define the code for f asp  precodeFoo fbool b      Foo x     Foo y     ifb return x     return y  codepre  pThen, each of our return values is an automatic object, so 12.8.31 says that it qualifies for copy elison.  That kicks over to 12.8.32 which says that the copy is performed as if it were an rvalue.  Now, the RVO doesnt happen because we dont know a priori which path to take, but the move constructor is called due to the requirements in 12.8.32.  Technically, one move constructor is avoided when copying into x.  Basically, when running, we getp  precodeconstructor constructor move destructor destructor fin destructor codepre  pTurning off elide on constructors generatesp  precodeconstructor constructor move destructor destructor move destructor fin destructor codepre  pNow, say we go back top  precodeFoo fbool b      Foo x     Foo y     return b  x  y  codepre  pWe have to look at the semantics for the conditional operator in 5.16.4p  blockquote   pIf the second and third operands are glvalues of the same value   category and have the same type, the result is of that type and value   category and it is a bitfield if the second or the third operand is a   bitfield, or if both are bitfields.p blockquote  pSince both x and y are lvalues, the conditional operator is an lvalue, but not an automatic object.  Therefore, 12.8.32 doesnt kick in and we treat the return value as an lvalue and not an rvalue.  This requires that the copy constructor be called.  Hence, we getp  precodeconstructor constructor copy destructor destructor fin destructor codepre  pNow, since the conditional operator in this case is basically copying out the value category, that means that the codep  precodeFoo fbool b      return b  Foo  Foo  codepre  pwill return an rvalue because both branches of the conditional operator are rvalues.  We see this withp  precodeconstructor fin destructor codepre  pIf we turning off elide on constructors, we see the movesp  precodeconstructor move destructor move destructor fin destructor codepre  pBasically, the idea is that if we return an rvalue well call the move constructor.  If we return an lvalue, well call the copy constructor.  When we return a nonvolatile automatic object whose type matches that of the return type, we return an rvalue.  If we have a decent compiler, these copies and moves may be elided with the RVO.  However, at the very least, we know what constructor is called in case the RVO cant be applied.p

Negative 6621 pI have a node.js express app endpoint that receives an SQLite database uploaded from the client side and passes it on to an S3 bucket on amazon.p  pMy function doesnt create the file locally but just pass the buffer. In my function, I want to load the Buffer as an SQlite, perform a count query and then upload the buffer to S3.p  pI could not find a library that does that. Ive looked at a hrefhttpsgithub.commapboxnodesqlite3 relnofollownodesqlite3a. This is the code Ive used to upload it to s3 without creating a local filep  pa hrefhttpsgithub.comthaumes3streamingblobmasterservicesawsstreaming.js relnofollowhttpsgithub.comthaumes3streamingblobmasterservicesawsstreaming.jsap
Negative 6621 pI have a complex avro record schema. I created a snappy compressed avro file with 10000 records using random avro data generator from avro tools. Then I converted that file to snappy compressed parquet file. The parquet block settings were at default.p  pI was surprised when I saw that parquet file was more than twice as big as avro file. The same compression codec was used. The same data was present in both files.p  pThe records have hundreds of fields many of which are arrays. Most primitives are ints,enums and strings. Most of the fields are also optional. There are arrays of complex objects as well. The maximum depth of nesting is between 15 and 20.p  pAny ideas why that happened Based on what they say about parquet, it should be smaller than avro file.p  pAnother curious thing When I convert the same avro file to trevni another columnar format the file is a bit smaller than original avro file. p

Negative 6621 pI have a deck of cards object that essentially just fills a deck array with 051 52 cards and then shuffles the cards. I have a cards.deal method that returns a card. When I use cards.pop I always get a different number, which is what is expected however, when I used cards.shift it always returns 0. Im content with using pop but would just like to understand for learning purposes why Im always getting a 0 when I use shift. Ive changed the number of shuffles to huge numbers like 10,000 just to make sure its shuffling enough to actually swap the first element in the array. Could it be possible that the Math.ceil method is not returning a 0, even after 10,000 random numbers generated between 0 and 51 What is going on herep  precodefunction Deck      var cards  []      this.shuffle  function          var tempCardHolder  0         var randomNumber  0         var randomNumber2  0           fill the card array with 52 cards         for x  0 x lt 51 x             cards[x]  x                     now lets shuffle them up by swapping two cards randomly 50 times         for y  0 y lt 100 y               make sure we get two random numbers that are different             do                  randomNumber  Math.ceilMath.random  51                 randomNumber2  Math.ceilMath.random  51              while randomNumber  randomNumber2              tempCardHolder  cards[randomNumber]             cards[randomNumber]  cards[randomNumber2]             cards[randomNumber2]  tempCardHolder                      this.deal  function         return cards.shift           this.getNumCardsLeft  function         return cards.length           codepre

Negative 6621 pI have just spent some time experimenting with Crate  crate.io  and first impressions are good.  If my understanding is right Crate is a NoSQL DB that provides a rather neat SQL interface for manipulating and querying the database.  Nicep  pHowever, at this stage I have more questions than answers.  Here are three for startersp  ul liThe Crate admin console is nice.  However, how  if at all  can I protect it apart from setting up an IP tables ruleli liHow do MySQL indices translate to Crate.  I do not see that I can continue to use UNIQUE indices and then rely on UPDATE...ON DUPLICATE KEY... SQL statementsli liFinally, if I am right in assuming that once I set up a cluster Crate takes care of data replication and synchronization with no further effort on my part.  So if I have geographically disperesed Crate cluster nodes will latency issues related to synchronization slow down the performance of the whole cluster  I am envisaging readngwriting to the local crate instance but with the option of then being able to recover those data from another crate instance at a later time synchrnously is not relevantli ul  pThese questions may not fully fit the SO format but given how young Crate I hope that they will still be considered acceptable.p

Negative 6621 pI have been creating a program which reads in a set of points and create a block for each individual point. These blocks are then further broken into two separate cells.  p  pI have been using Python and codeTkintercode paired with a codevtkTKWindowInteractorcode to render my cells. p  pI have been assigning my points, polys and scalars to a codevtk.vtkPolyDatacode and then mapped  with codevtkPolyDataMappercode to a codevtkActorcode.  Up to approximately 1.5 million points the vtkActor will successfully render with associated scalars. p  pHowever, after this point the codevtkActorcode fails to appear in the window and I do not get any errors. I noticed that if I turn off calculating my sclars I am able to successfully process more points.

Negative 6621 pI am running a Spring Boot application that talks to an external soap service. p  pXJC is converting the a hrefhttpwww.xcbl.orgxcbl40 relnofollowXCBL4.0 OrderManagement standarda to java objects that I then populate and marshall into xml to send to a soap service. p  pThe soap service I am sending to cannot use namespace prefixes for the root elements. I understand the way they are doing this is wrong but they will not change. When I marshall an OrderResponse object I get the xml back perfectly, no namespace prefix for the root elements but it does add unused namespaces. When I marshall any other type of Message or Material Order It gives me tons of unused namespaces. p  pI need the unused namespaces removed from the XML so the service Im sending it to will accept it.p  pstrongOrder Response XML Working, but adding all unused namespacesstrong p  precode    ltOrderResponse  xmlnsrrnorg.xcblschemasxcblv40ordermanagementv10ordermanagement.xsd  xmlnscorerrnorg.xcblschemasxcblv40corecore.xsd  xmlnsmessagerrnorg.xcblschemasxcblv40messagemanagementv10messagemanagement.xsd  xmlnsns7rrnorg.xcblschemasxcblv40materialsmanagementv10materialsmanagement.xsd  xmlnsns8httptempuri.org  xmlnsxsihttpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchemainstance  xsinoNamespaceSchemaLocationrrnorg.xcblschemasxcblv40ordermanagementv10ordermanagement.xsd  xsischemaLocationrrnorg.xcblschemasxcblv40ordermanagementv10ordermanagement.xsdgt codepre  pstrongWhat Order Response XML Should look likestrong p  precode    ltOrderResponse  xmlnsrrnorg.xcblschemasxcblv40ordermanagementv10ordermanagement.xsd  xmlnscorerrnorg.xcblschemasxcblv40corecore.xsd  xmlnsxsihttpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchemainstance  xsischemaLocationrrnorg.xcblschemasxcblv40ordermanagementv10ordermanagement.xsdgt codepre  pNotice how its adding message management and materials management.

Negative 6621 pMost of what I read says that you should call onSaveInstanceState on your DialogFragment to save its state and then call onActivityCreated and restore the state there.  While this works, I found a problemp  pIf I have an EditText in my custom layout of my DialogFragment AlertDialog and lets say I type in my password in it.  The password is masked and cursor is blinking after the last password character I have entered.  If I save value entered in EditText in onSaveInstanceState and restore state using onActivityCreated, it is restored but the cursor is moved to the beginning of what I just typed in before rotation instead of staying at the end.p  pHowever, if I restore what I saved using onCreateDialog by checking my savedInstanceState for null first, then my cursor stays at the end after the last character typed in which is what it should be.p  pI wonder which way is correct although I see both working fine and retaining the password on rotation change.  It is the only that one little think that the cursor moves to the begining instead of staying at the end in the case of onActivityCreated.p  pMuch appreciated,p

Negative 6621 pI have an FPGA acquisition board that streams data to the PC through PCIe2 4 lanes. I managed to get the full specs bandwidth of 1.6 GBs. Data are coming into the FPGA from ADCs at 1.5 GBs ad I used a relative small FIFO 16k points just for buffering. On the PC side I have 32GB of DDR42133 and I locked and dma mapped 16GB of it. When I start to transfer data, the PCIe root complex starts to throttle the channel and sometimes the throttling is so intense that the cumulative wait reaches 1ms. By that I mean I get grant to transfer one TLP, wait for 1us, one TLP, wait etc... and eventually the FIFO gets full and I start to lose data and I cannot increase the FIFO size. Theres a correlation between the heaviness of data throttling and the workload of the OS, especially ethernet, audio, graphic traffic. I was looking for if there is a way to forcibly prioritize the RAM access.p  pIn one scenario those streamed data will eventually be written to disk, hopefully realtime, and instead of streaming data to the RAM and then opening and writing to a file, I was wondering if there is a way to directly map a file to an already present memory region so I will only need to force a ram flush.p  pIn another scenario, data will eventually be real time processed by the CPU. Right now Im running the user space code that deals with the driver in a thread with a dedicated core I have 10 cores HT. Whenever a block of data is streamed I get an interrupt and another thread processing thread, in another dedicated core, gets woken up and starts processing the data. Before doing this, kernel code syncs the dma mapped buffer for cpu access and this takes time, not much but at the data rate Im working with is significant. In principle I guess I can avoid this because the CPU is not going to access the same location at the same time as the FPGA, is that right Then the processing thread starts to read and process the data while the streaming keeps going. Instead of using a for cycle to read data from ram to cache, is there a way to force a large amount of memory to be transferred to the cachep  pI know Im dealing with humongous data throughput.p  pLast question before digging into a RT linux OS, do you think I will have some advantagesp  pThanksp

I want a way to build some code into the parser that will automatically detect these crazy long links anywhere in the page content and maybe shorten them to something like codehttpexample.comcoolthingscode.p  pI would like some type of PHP function I can use that will scan through the page and shorten the crazy long URLs if they are found.

Negative 6621 pFor emmostem programs, its better to a hrefhttputf8everywhere.org relnofollowuse UTF8 internallya and, when necessary, convert to other encodings. But in my case, I want to write a Javascript interpreter, and its much simpler to store only UTF16 strings or arrays of codeu16code, becausep  ol lipI need to address 16bits code units individually this is a bad idea in general, but Javascript requires this. This means I need it to implement codeIndexltusizegtcode.pli lipI need to store unpaired surrogates, that is, malformed UTF16 strings because of this, ECMAScript strings are technically defined as arrays of codeu16code, that a hrefhttpwww.ecmainternational.orgecma2625.1sec4.3.16 relnofollowemusuallyema represent UTF16 strings. There is an encoding aptly named a hrefhttpssimonsapin.github.iowtf8 relnofollowWTF8a to store unpaired surrogates in UTF8, but I dont want to use something like this.pli ol  pI want to have the usual owned  borrowed types like codeStringcode  codestrcode and codeCStringcode  codeCStrcode with all or most usual methods. I dont want to roll my own string type if I can avoid.p  pAlso, my strings will always be immutable, behind an codeRccode and referred from a data structure containing weak pointers to all strings implementing a hrefhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiStringinterning relnofollowstring interninga. This might be relevant perhaps it would be better to have codeRcltUtf16Strgtcode as the string type, where codeUtf16Strcode is the unsized string type which can be defined as just codestruct Utf16Str[u16]code. That would avoid following two pointers when accessing the string, but I dont know how to instantiate an codeRccode with an unsized type.p  pGiven the above requirements, merely using rustencoding is very inconvenient, because it treats all nonUTF8 encodings a hrefhttpslifthrasiir.github.iorustencodingencodingtypestrait.Encoding.htmlmethod.encode relnofollowas vectors of codeu8codea.p  pAlso, Im not sure if a hrefhttpsinternals.rustlang.orgtprerfcstabilizeutf16encodinginstd2152 relnofollowusing the std librarya at all might help me here.

I really liked his classLoader and httpfoundation libraries and decided to integrate them.p  pI read the whole tutorial but I decided to stop integrating Symfonys components up to part 5 of the tutorial where he gets to the Symfony http kernel, route matcher and controller resolver excluding those.p  pThere are the front controller and route mapper file of my framework that qre in question.p  pfront.phpthe front controllerp  precodeltphp           require configconfig.php         require configrouting.php         require srcautoloader.php          use SymfonyComponentHttpFoundationRequest         use SymfonyComponentHttpFoundationResponse          request  RequestcreateFromGlobals          response  new Response           path  requestgtgetPathInfo          ifissetsiteMap[path]              calluserfuncarraysrcControllers . . siteMap[path][controller] .  . siteMap[path][action], arraysiteMap[path][arguments]          else                  responsegtsetStatusCode404             responsegtsetContentPage not found               responsegtsend gt   codepre  pMy routing file    precode       Map of routes   siteMap  array gt arraycontroller gt IndexController, action gt indexAction, arguments gt ,                     categories gt arraycontroller gt CategoriesController, action gt indexAction,  codepre  pWhat I want to know now is without further using Symfonys components, how can I do something like thisp  pIn my routing file I wanna add an URL like hello with Controller  Hello Controller and arguments name,age,gender that would correspond to a request in the browser GET www.basehellosamuel11male.p  pAnd in the HelloController have an indexActionname, age, gender  ... . I have tried looking at Symfonys source but it eludes me so farI spent a lot of time going trough the source code of the libraries. I am going to modularize and separate the functions of the front controller and controller resolving even further but I want to get this down.p  pAh and also any advice on building my framework further would be welcomeI am creating a framework for a REST  like web service that needs to be scalable and fast and handle tens of thousands requests per second maybe.p

Negative 6621 pIm creating an App to send Latitude and Longitude via SMS if the mobile moves in one minute interval. I used an codeArrayListcode to save six codeLatLngscode after ArrayList reaches six elements it sends SMS. If the device stops moving within the time of six minutes then the codeArrayListcode will be less than six. If the device not moves for twenty minutes then it sends the unfilled ArrayList. I used codeCountdownTimercode to achieve this. It worked fine it sends codeLatLngscode as long as I move. But, if I stop before the ArrayList fills it sends the ArrayList whatever it has after 20 minutes. Not a problem with that. But, after that it keeps sending SMS in one minute interval.

Negative 6621 pI want to restore an RDS instance from a snapshot and have it replace an instance in a cloudformation. p  pLets say I have one EC2 instance connected to one RDS instance in a cloud formation and I want to restore the RDS instance from a snapshot.p  pSince an RDS snapshot can only be restored into a new RDS instance, and that new RDS instance needs the domain name of the old instance for my EC2 to reach it, I have to let go of the old RDS instance by renaming or deleting before creating the new restore, but then the new RDS is not in my cloud formation stack anymore and does not have the proper tags.

Negative 6621 pI have been trying without success to get a launch image screenshot from app to display.  I tried adding it as a file named Default.png to the project as apparently people did back in the day.  Adding icon.png to the project is the only way Ive been able to get the icon to appear.p  pI also tried the newer version suggested by apple of going into imgcassette and creating a launchImage set.  I dont have separately sized images for all the possible combinations but did drag and drop my screenshot onto most of the spaces i.e. those for a phone as opposed to iPad.  According to what Ive read once you do this, it is supposed to just work.p  pHowever, no matter what I do, the image is not displaying.  Instead I just get black screen. My target device is an iPhone 4s running IOS7.p  pCan anyone suggest what else to tryp  pThanks.p

Negative 6621 pI have surfed a lot about performing core data operations in multiple threads but no good luck to solve my problem.p  pMy code is such that I have to download a csv file after every ten minutes which contains each entry of 10 seconds. This file once downloaded is parsed and the contents are saved in database and then files are removed as then, when needed, I can fetch data from database. p  pNow, I have a huge existing content of more than a month for now which may extend to years also as time passes by, performing this huge task of saving new files to database and fetching objects from core data into an array for already downloaded files using a single thread is causing a huge processing time. Also, views in app needs to be adjusted with all previous data They are basically plots of quantity vs time.p  pHow can I achieve this in multiple threads and optimize my code processing time and reduce UI Blockage to minimump  pPlease note that  Performing the task in background thread is not my concern as I in any case have to show graphs on the basis of total data.

Negative 6621 pI was wondering if this community could help isolate and solve an issue for me. When you look at this theme demo a hrefhttpthemetastic.themepunch.com relnofollowhttpthemetastic.themepunch.coma, you can see dropdown submenu on the main navigation i.e. Home  Home Example 1, Home Example 2 etc..p  pHowever, when I install the theme, the dropdown submenu does not display. It is there in the code, but doesnt display.p  pHeres what Ive done, with no fixp  ul liupdated the latest theme li liswitched from the child theme to the Themetastic themeli liupdated all plugins and WordPressli lidisabled and reenabled all plugins li liinstalled a clean version of WordPress and installed only the Themetastic theme a hrefhttpwpbase.saveda.com relnofollowhttpwpbase.saveda.coma with the menu Sample Page  Another Sample Page ...nothing, no fixli ul  pIf I switch to another theme, such as twentytwenty, the submenu appears. So its there.p  pWhen I look more closely at the code on the themes demo vs what I have on my site, there is an element style on the demo that appears to be turning the visibility on and off for the submenu that doesnt exist when I install the theme.p  pFor example, the theme demo hasp  pcodeltul classsubmenu styletop 102px visibility visible left 0px width 177px display nonegtcodep  pwhich then toggles to this when the top menu item is hovered overp  pcodeltul classsubmenu styletop 102px visibility visible left 0px width 177px display blockgtcodep  pWhile on my installed version of the theme, the submenu code is codeltul classsubmenugtcode thats it, no change on hoverp  pI havent been able to find a theme option that addresses menu or submenus. I cant see any way to apply an element style to the menu via custom CSS. Is it JS Their support is giving me the run around by asking me basic questions that Ive already answered with 24 hours between every response.... and were supposed to have gone live yesterday, literally. I just need to find a fix since weve build and customized two sites on this theme.p  pThanks for any helpp

Negative 6621 pIm working with two databases.  One database is on Microsoft SQL 2012 and the other is on MySQL 5.5. Microsoft SQL Server has an Orders table and the MySQL has three Currency Exchange Rate tables.  The Orders table has orders from 6 different countries however, orders from 3 of the countries have sales totals in their local currencies nonU.S..  The 3 Currency Exchange Rates tables are separated by country containing daily rates.  Using PHP, I need to get current years total sales grouped by month and country and have the exchange rates applied to those countries total sales that are not in U.S. currency.  Each months exchange rate needs to be the average rate for that month.  p  pI have two arrays below.  The first array is for the orders which have the sales summed and grouped by month and country.  The second array is for the currency exchange rate which has the average exchange rates calculated and grouped by month and country.  p  pHow would I multiply the total sales each month by the exchange rate for the countries that are not in U.S. currency, which are KR, JP, and NZ   p  h2Ordersh2  precodequery  dbgtprepareSELECT MONTHUSOrderDate AS MONTH, a.Country, SUMa.Sales AS TotalSales FROM  SELECT     CASE          WHEN Country  KR THEN DATEADDDAY, 1, CASTOrderDate AS Date          ELSE CASTOrderDate as Date END AS USOrderDate, Country, SUMTotal AS Sales FROM Orders  WHERE OrderStatusID in 7,8,9 AND Country  KR OR OrderStatusID in 7,8,9 AND Country  JP OR OrderStatusID in 7,8,9 AND Country  AU OR OrderStatusID in 7,8,9 AND Country  NZ OR OrderStatusID in 7,8,9 AND Country  US OR OrderStatusID in 7,8,9 AND Country  CA GROUP BY CASTOrderDate as Date,Country AS a WHERE YEARUSOrderDate  YEARGETDATE GROUP BY MONTHUSOrderDate, a.Country Order BY MONTHUSOrderDate ASC  try      querygtexecute     results  querygtfetchALLPDOFETCHASSOC   catch PDOException e      dieerror egtgetMessage     array54    [0]gt   array3      [MONTH]gt     string1 1     [Country]gt     string2 AU     [TotalSales]gt     string7 9095.70      [1]gt   array3      [MONTH]gt     string1 1     [Country]gt     string2 CA     [TotalSales]gt     string9 113993.00      [2]gt   array3      [MONTH]gt     string1 1     [Country]gt     string2 KR     [TotalSales]gt     string7 9284.75      [3]gt   array3      [MONTH]gt     string1 1     [Country]gt     string2 NZ     [TotalSales]gt     string6 883.25      [4]gt   array3      [MONTH]gt     string1 1     [Country]gt     string2 US     [TotalSales]gt     string9 609538.25      [5]gt   array3      [MONTH]gt     string1 2     [Country]gt     string2 AU     [TotalSales]gt     string7 7393.65      [6]gt   array3      [MONTH]gt     string1 2     [Country]gt     string2 CA     [TotalSales]gt     string9 100279.43      [7]gt   array3      [MONTH]gt     string1 2     [Country]gt     string2 JP     [TotalSales]gt     string9 916110.00      [8]gt   array3      [MONTH]gt     string1 2     [Country]gt     string2 KR     [TotalSales]gt     string7 5217.55      [9]gt   array3      [MONTH]gt     string1 2     [Country]gt     string2 NZ     [TotalSales]gt     string7 1355.85      [10]gt   array3      [MONTH]gt     string1 2     [Country]gt     string2 US     [TotalSales]gt     string9 616422.11      .... codepre  h2Exchange Ratesh2  precodequeryexchangerate  dbexchangerategtprepareSELECT Monthdate AS MONTH, NZ AS Country, ROUNDSUMrateCOUNTrate,5 AS AVGRATE FROM currencyexchangerates.newzealand WHERE YEARdate  YEARCURDATE GROUP BY MONTHdate     UNION SELECT Monthdate AS MONTH, JP AS Country, ROUNDSUMrateCOUNTrate,5 AS AVGRATE FROM currencyexchangerates.japan WHERE YEARdate  YEARCURDATE GROUP BY MONTHdate     UNION SELECT Monthdate AS MONTH, KR AS Country, ROUNDSUMrateCOUNTrate,5 AS AVGRATE FROM currencyexchangerates.southkorea WHERE YEARdate  YEARCURDATE GROUP BY MONTHdate ORDER BY MONTH ASC  try      queryexchangerategtexecute     resultsexchangerate  queryexchangerategtfetchALLPDOFETCHASSOC   catch PDOException e      dieerror egtgetMessage    array27    [0]gt   array3      [MONTH]gt     string1 1     [Country]gt     string2 NZ     [AVGRATE]gt     string7 0.76614      [1]gt   array3      [MONTH]gt     string1 1     [Country]gt     string2 JP     [AVGRATE]gt     string7 0.00845      [2]gt   array3      [MONTH]gt     string1 1     [Country]gt     string2 KR     [AVGRATE]gt     string7 0.00090      [3]gt   array3      [MONTH]gt     string1 2     [Country]gt     string2 NZ     [AVGRATE]gt     string7 0.74309      [4]gt   array3      [MONTH]gt     string1 2     [Country]gt     string2 JP     [AVGRATE]gt     string7 0.00842      [5]gt   array3      [MONTH]gt     string1 2     [Country]gt     string2 KR     [AVGRATE]gt     string7 0.00090    codepre
