Positive 1763 pI am developing a mobile application that calls a RESTFul web service to retrieve information from my database.

Positive 1763 pI have two Laravel APIs that are serving an AngularJS app all on my local development machine.  Im getting a weird issue when the Angular page calls POSTs to both APIs where it seems to be using the wrong database name its using the other Laravels instances database.

Ive tried calling each of the APIs using Postman and that works fine, and Im sure there is no mention of the other database in either project.p  pTo me this seems like a caching issue, where the .env file might be cached and shared between the two Laravel servers for some reason.  Both of the Laravel apps are hosted on Apache.

Positive 1763 pQuestion here about caching data from calls to an external ReST API. p  pThere is currently a ReST service set up to generate and retrieve some specific types of reports that the UI must consume. However, this service is not meant for high volume usage, or to be exposed to the public and these reports are fairly static. Possibly only changing every 1020 minutes. The web application resides on a separate server. p  pWhat I would like to do is, using memcached or Redis, is when a request for data comes in from the UI to the web backend, make a call from the web application backend to the report server to get the specified report, transform the data to the appropriate format for the UI to consume, cache it with a timestamp, and return it to the UI so subsequent requests will be available in memory on the web applications backend without having to rerequest from the report server. I would also need to check this timestamp and make a new request if the cached report has been held for longer than the specified time. The data that will be cached is fairly minuscule just some smallish JSON objects with only a handful of values holding the information the UI needs and there is NOT a ton of these objects, I would not be surprised if they could all be easily stored in memory at once so the time stamping is the only invalidation that should be necessary.p  pI have almost 0 experience here when it comes to caching  memcached  Redis. Is there advantages to one or the other Is something like this possible How would I go about implementing this Are there other optionsp  pAppreciate the helpp

Positive 1763 pIve been looking into ways to speed up my website.  One of the things I came across is output caching in IIS.  Can someone tell me the difference between usermode and kernelmode caching  My webpages bring up data based on the user logged on.

If I turn off the caching, it again brings up their stuff.  Im afraid to try just one or the other without first knowing what the difference is.  I searched and I cannot find anything that helps me understand it.  Thanks in advance  I have IIS 6.1 and created my webpages using Visual Studio and vb.p

Positive 1763 pI dont have experience scalingout SQL backend, but from what Ive read so far, sharding for writes and caching for reads seem to be two of the most common practices. Im trying to learn how eventual consistency could be minimized with the right caching strategy.p  pId like to use Azure SQL Database, Entity Framework amp Elastic Scale middleware, and Redis for testing purposes.p  pemIs there a way to commit a distributed transaction to both SQL Server and Redisem p  pemIf not, whats an effective way to ensure read freshness when a database change occursem p  pI could write to SQL and update cache in the same API, but writing to cache might fail for whatever reason. I could implement a retry logic, but assuming all attempts fail, I could try to rollback the SQL transaction or simply serve old cache data to clients and periodically rebuild cache to catch up with the database. Of course, the latter would mean data reads are not consistent for a period of time. Evicting data and reading from the SQL cluster is another option, but crossshard queries might be very expensive, especially when they involve complex joins and you have hundreds, if not thousands, of databases on commodity hardware.p

Positive 1763 hr  pWhile looking at the potential use cases for JQuery Deferred Promises, I came across Caching as one of the potential uses. That brought about the following question While using modern browsers and smart clients Jquery, any modern MVC, etc., do I even have to worry about caching anything myself I am working with MEAN stack and I am under the impression that caching does happen by default.

Negative 1763 pA couple of weeks ago, my piano teacher and I were bouncing ideas off of each other concerning metacomposing music software. The idea was thisp  pThere is a system taking midi input from a bunch of instruments, and pushes output to the speakers and lights. The software running on this system analyzes the midi data its getting, and determines which sounds to use, based on triggers set up by the composer when I play an F7 chord 3 times within 2 seconds, switch from the harpsichord sound to the piano sound, pedals, or actual realtime analysis of the music. It would control the lights based on the performance and sounds of the instruments in a similar fashion  the musician would only have to vaguely specify what they wanted  and real time analysis of their playing would do the rest. On the fly procedurally generated music could play along with the musician as well. Essentially, the software would play along with the performer, with one guiding the other. I imagine that it would take some practice to get use to such a system, but that it could have quite incredible results.p  pIm a big fan of improv jazz. One characteristic of improv that is lacking from other art forms is the temporalness of it.

Negative 1763 pI have a Django site set up that uses the Django admin panel, prefixed with codemediacode, as well as static site content in a directory called codestaticcode. The admin media stuff, of course, lives within the Django package, and the sites static content is stored along with the Python code for the site.p  pCurrently, my codepublichtmlcode just contains appropriatelynamed symlinks to the directories that actually hold the static content, as followsp  precodepublichtml     .htaccess     media gt HOMEusrlibpython2.4sitepackagesdjangocontribadminmedia     site.fcgi     site gt HOMEmysitepublicstatic codepre  pAnd these are the rewrite rules Im using in my code.htaccesscode filep  precodeRewriteEngine On RewriteCond REQUESTFILENAME f RewriteRule . site.fcgi1 [QSA,L] codepre  pHowever, using symlinks in this way feels like a...hack, and it seems like I could use rewrite rules in the code.htaccesscode to avoid using symlinks.

Negative 1763 pIs there a way to use the CompiledQuery.Compile method to compile the Expression associated with an IQueryable Currently I have an IQueryable with a very large Expression tree behind it. The IQueryable was built up using several methods which each supply components. For example, two methods may return IQueryables which are then joined in a third. For this reason I cant explicitly define the entire expression within the compile method call. p  pI was hoping to pass the expression in to the compile method as someIQueryable.Expression, however this expression isnt in the form required by the compile method. If I try and get around this by putting the query directly into the compile method, egp  precode    var foo  CompiledQuery.CompileltDataContext, IQueryableltUsergtgtdc gt dc.getUsers     var bar  foothis codepre  pwhere I make the call form within a datacontext, I get an error saying that getUsers is not mapped as a stored procedure or userdefined function. Again I cant just copy the contents of the getUsers method to where I make the compile call since it in turn makes use of other methods.p  pIs there some way to pass the Expression on the IQueryable returned from getUsers into the Compile methodp  pstrongUpdatedstrong I tried to force my will on the system with the following codep  precode    var phony  Expression.LambdaltFuncltDataContext, IQueryableltUsergtgtgt         getUsers.Expression, Expression.ParametertypeofDataContext, dc      FuncltDataContext, IQueryableltUsergtgt wishful  CompiledQuery.CompileltDataContext, IQueryableltUsergtgtphony     var foo  wishfulthis codepre  pfoo ends up beingp  pSystem.Data.Linq.SqlClient.SqlProviderOneTimeEnumerable1[Model.Entities.User]p  pI dont have the option to see the results in foo, as instead of offering to expand the results and run the query I only see the message Operation could destabilize the runtime.p  pI just need to find a way for the sql string to only be generated once and used as a paramaterized command on subsequent requests, I can do this manually using the GetCommand method on the data context, but then I have to explicitly set all the parameters and do the object mapping myself, which is a few hundred lines of code given the complexity of this particular query.p  pstrongUpdatedstrongp  pJohn Rusk provided the most useful information, so I awarded him the win on this one. However, some extra tweaking was required and there were a couple of other issues I encountered along the way so I thought Id Expand on the answer. Firstly, the Operation could destabalize the runtime error was not due to the compilation of the expression, it was actually because of some casting deep in the expression tree. In some places I needed to call the code.CastltTgtcode method to formally cast items, even when they were of the correct type. Without going into too much detail this was basically required when several expression were combined into a single tree and each branch could return a different type, which were each the sub type of a common class.p  pAfter solving the destabalizing issue, I returned to the compilation problem. Johns expand solution was almost there. It looked for method call expressions in the tree and tried to resolve them to the underlying expression that method would usually return. My references to expressions were not provided by method calls, but instead properties. So I needed to modify the expression visitor that performs the expansion to include these typesp  precodeprotected override Expression VisitMemberAccessMemberExpression m      ifm.Method.DeclaringType  typeofExpressionExtensions          return new ExpressionExpander.VisitExpressionSystem.Reflection.PropertyInfom.Member.GetValuenull, null          return base.VisitMemberAccessm  codepre  pThis method may not be appropriate in all cases, but it should help anyone who finds themselves in the same predicament.p
Negative 1763 pI have created an application a webbased application which now has a large number of associations. Simply put, an Accountp  ul lihas many Usersli lihas Settingsli lihas many Projectsli ul  pSimilarly a Projectp  ul lihas many Itemsli ul  pA Userp  ul lihas many Tasksli ul  pAnd so on, with loads more associations. Nothing particularly unusual about that I hope. I chose to use NHibernate to give me a nice set of persistent classes with mappers defining all of the associations.p  pBut is this approach right On every request to the application the Account is loaded because it is needed and this then requests a large amount of data from the DB that is not required. Lazy loading is an option, but I dont know if my initial approach couldnt be better. All I want at that stage is the Account and associated Settings so should the mapping reflect this Trouble is I want things like all the Projects for an Account at other points so I need the mappers to reflect all of the associations.p  pMy concern is that lazyloading may just be compensating for a bad initial architecture on my part. I am well aware that this may just be a result of my asyet poor knowledge of the inner workings of NHibernate. As a result Id be grateful for any suggestions on good practice.p

If it helps, my configure script does not appear to be looking for any gtk libs.p  pstrongUPDATE2strongp  pSo the basic solution for the problem in update1 seems to be that I needed to add the following check to my configure.ac filep  precodePKGCHECKMODULESGTK, [gtk2.0 gt 2.12]  PACKAGECFLAGSg Wall GTKCFLAGS PACKAGELIBSg GTKLIBS PACKAGELDFLAGSexportdynamic GTKLDFLAGS  ACSUBST[PACKAGECFLAGS] ACSUBST[PACKAGELIBS] ACSUBST[PACKAGELDFLAGS] codepre  pThis gets added to the checks for programs section under ACPROGCC.  What this does is tell configure to check for the gtk2.0 library.  The upper case GTK seems to be an arbitrary variable name, and the CFLAGS, LIBS, and LDFLAGS and probably more gets added to it dynamically so that you can generate the PACKAGE variables.  The ACSUBST seems to make it so you can access the PACKAGE variables in your Makefile.ams.  FYI, the exportdynamic flag is added so that you can use gladegtkbuilder files Im sure there are other reasons, but Im still at a very basic level of understanding.p  pIn srcMakefile.am, you should havep  precodebinPROGRAMS  app  appSOURCES  main.c main.h  appLDADD  PACKAGELIBS appLDFLAGS  PACKAGELDFLAGS INCLUDES  PACKAGECFLAGS codepre  pThis seems to be all you need for a basic gtk2.0 C app.  It has actually inspired me to write a simple tutorial for setting up a C gtk app that uses autotools.  There is a definite lack of recent beginner documentationinformation in this field.p

When we implement interfaces, its created a new slot on the method table for the methods of said interface shouldnt we be implementing I2Draw too in class Ap  pLikewise, when we call a method using an interface variable like i1.Draw i understand were on dynamic dispatch, and therefore we should look at the type of the object being held by the variabletype A in that case and search As method table for a method called specifically I1.Draw.

Negative 1763 pDo you know of any library that would provide a welltested concurrent quicksort or mergesort algorithm for Javap  pWeve had issues on a 16virtualcores Mac where only one core  was working using the default Java sorting algo and it was, well, not good to see that very fine machine be completely underused.  So we wrote our own I wrote it and we did indeed gain good speedups I wrote a multithreaded quicksort and due to its partitioning nature it parallelize very well but I could have written a mergesort too...  But my implementation only scales up to 4 threads, its proprietary code, and Id rather use one coming from a reputable source instead of using my reinvented wheel.p  pThe only one I found on the Web is an example of how strongnotstrong to write a multithreaded quicksort in Java, it is busylooping which is really terrible using ap  precodewhile helpRequested   codepre  pa hrefhttpbroadcast.oreilly.com200906maycolumnmultithreadedalgor.htmlhttpbroadcast.oreilly.com200906maycolumnmultithreadedalgor.htmlap  pSo in addition to losing one thread for no reason its making sure to kill the perfs by busylooping in that while loop which is mindboggling.p  pHence my question do you know of any correctly multithreaded quicksort or mergesort implementation in Java that would be coming from a reputable sourcep  pI put the emphasis on the fact that I know that the complexity stays On log n but Id still enjoy very much to see all these cores start working instead of idling.  Note that for other tasks, on that same 16 virtual cores Mac, I saw speedup of up to x7 by parallelizing the code and Im by no mean an expert in concurrency.p  pSo even tough the complexity stays On log n, Id really appreciate a x7 or x8 or even x16 speedup.p
Negative 1763 pThis is an assignment question that I am having trouble wording an answer to.p  pSuppose a tree may have up to k children per node. Let v be the average number of children per node. For what values of v is it more efficient in terms of space used to store the child nodes in a linked list versus storage in an array Whyp  pI believe I can answer the why more or less in plain English  it will be more efficient to use the linked list because rather than having a bunch of empty nodes ie empty indexes in the array if your average is lower than the max taking up memory you only alloc space for a node in a linked list when youre actually filling in a value. p  pSo if youve got an average of 6 children when your maximum is 200, the array will be creating space for all 200 children of each node when the tree is created, but the linked list will only alloc space for the nodes as needed.  So, with the linked list, space used will be approximately the average with the array, spaced used will be the max.p  p...I dont see when it would ever be more efficient to use the array.  Is this a trick question  Do I have to take into account the fact that the array needs to have a limit on total number of nodes when its createdp

Naturally, such an application will have many users with different access rights in the DB, and each with their own login name and password.p  pSo how do you implement this One way is to create a DB login for every application user, but thats a pretty serious thing to do, which even requires admin rights on the DB server, etc. If the DB server hosts several applications, the admins are quite likely not to be happy with this.p  pIn the web world typically one creates his own Users table which contains all the necessary info, and uses one fixed DB login for all interaction.

Negative 1763 pMy iPhone app relies on a vendors XML feed to provide data. But that feed is not locked down. The vendor could change the format of the XML at any time, although so far theyve promised not to. p  pSince I might want to tell my app to use a different URL for its data source, Id like to set up a single Command Central Web page, on my own  server, to direct the app to the correct data source.p  pIn other words, each time my app starts, in the background and unseen by the user, it would visit httpwww.myserver.comiphoneappdatasources.xml to retrieve the URL for retrieving data from my vendor. That way, if my vendor suddenly changes the exact URL or the XML feed that the app needs, I can update that Web page and ensure that all installations of the app are using the correct XML feed. p  pDoes anyone have any advice or examples showing this kind of approach It seems as if this must be a common problem, but so far I havent found a wellestablished design pattern that fits it.p

While the destructor for an object is executing, the objects lifetime has not yet ended, thus its not UB to invoke the destructor again. On the other hand, 12.46 saysp  blockquote   pAfter executing the body [...] a   destructor for class X calls the   destructors for Xs direct members,   the destructors for Xs direct base   classes [...]p blockquote  pwhich means that after the return from a recursive invocation of a destructor, all member and base class destructors will have been called, and calling them again when returning to the previous level of recursion would be UB. Therefore, a class with no base and only POD members can have a recursive destructor without UB. Am I rightp

I have been programming in Microsoft shops for the past 15 years but I would really like to expand my horizons a little bit.  Im torn between leveraging my Microsoft experience, and picking up something new that all the kids are doing these days.

Negative 1763 pI am generating an automatically generated periodical report with Sweave. In order to create a nice header I use the fancyhdr package which works really well so far.

Negative 1763 pHelp Please I spent some 20 hours working on a project and in the end I get a absolute specatular really weird failure of the code. I think it might have to do with where  I am saving it and builds. Here are my errors  These never happened before and they are probably more related to where I am building  here is the really long error list. Its so crazy because it goes through everything and then it fails I have 20 hours into this app and would not want it to fail I have tried cleaning all targets and tried deleteing the stuff in the build folder. What else can I do Move the project into another folder I am willing to pay if I can get the right answer unless thats against the community rules.p  precodeUndefined symbols

Below the third and fourth lines fail to have any extra indentationp  precodefoolonglonglonglong       barlonglonglonglong[     xlonglonglonglong  X amp     ylonglonglonglong  Y] codepre  pDoes anyone know how to fix pythonmode.el 5.1.0 so that backslash continuations indent the same as parenthesis continuationsp  hr  pstrongEDITstrong Although Im happy to just use parens all day long python is after all, rather lisp like..., I collaborate with others who use backslash continuations.  Emacs messes up the indentation when I press TAB, which I often do as a reflex.

Negative 1763 pIm working with your standard three table tag setupp  precodeitemtable  itemid  itemname  tagtable  tagid  tagname  tagmap  mapid  tagid  itemid codepre  pHow this works should be obvious to anyone who has used a similar scheme for their tagging architecture, now, using this scheme I have a scenario in which I need to print the results of the itemtable that match multiple tags, meaning they must have each tag presented to match and print the item from the item table, something written theoretically like thisp  precodeSELECT i.itemid, i.itemname, t.tagid, t.tagname, m.tagid, m.itemid FROM itemtable AS i JOIN tagtable AS t ON t.tagid  m.tagid JOIN tagmap AS m ON m.itemid  i.itemid WHERE t.tagname  tagone AND t.tagname  tagtwo codepre  pAnd the desired output would be something likep  pitem 1 because the records for item 1 have assigned both tagone and tagtwo in the tag map item 2 ditto but not item 3 because it only has tagone, or none of the tagsp  pOf course I know this wouldnt work, and why, I merely provided the misformed example to highlight what Im trying to accomplish.p  pThanks in advance for any advice.p

Negative 1763 pI am implementing a custom Membership Provider and a custom Role Provider.  It is working fine.  I have a custom database that has all of my users and all of the roles and emmostem of the associations between users and roles.  There are a few roles where the code to figure out who is in the role is much more complicated.  It sort of needs to be done on a user by user basis and there is no simple way to return a list of all of the users in one of these other roles.  So what I am trying to do is add the user to the role at runtime.  So when the user logs in I will get most of their roles from the custom Role Provider.  However I want to run some additional code at login to check and see if they are also part of these other two roles.  If they are then I want to add those two roles to the user sort of temporarily  for the session.  In other words I want my application to know that they are part of those roles, but I dont want the provider to attempt to persist that back to the underlying database.  I hope I have described this correctly.p  pAm I even thinking about this correctly  Is this the right approach  Can this be donep  pPlease let me know if this is unclear or doesnt make sense.p  pThanks, Coreyp

Negative 1763 pIm designing a program I plan to implement in C and I have a question about the best way in terms of performance to call external programs. The user is going to provide my program with a filename, and then my program is going to run another program with that file as input. My program is then going to process the output of the other program.p  pMy typical approach would be to redirect the other programs output to a file and then have my program read that file when its done. However, I understand IO operations are quite expensive and I would like to make this program as efficient as possible.p  pI did a little bit of looking and I found the codepopencode command for running system commands and grabbing the output. How does the performance of this approach compare to the performance of the approach I just described Does codepopencode simply write the external programs output to a temporary file, or does it keep the program output in memoryp  pAlternatively, is there another way to do this that will give better performancep

Negative 1763 pIm working on a project with designing a core data system for searching and cataloguing images and documents.  One of the objects in my data model is a key word object.  Every time I add a new key word I first want to first run though all of the existing keywords to make sure it doesnt already exist in the current context. p  pIve read in posts here and in a lot of my reading that doing string comparisons is a far more expensive processing than some other comparison operations. Since I could easily end up having to check many thousands of words before a new addition Im wondering if it would be worth using some method that would represent the key word strings numerically for the purpose of this process.  Possibly breaking down each character in the string into a number formed from the UTF code for each character and then storing that in an ID property for each key word.p  pI was wondering if anyone else thought any benefit might come from this approach or if anyone else had any better ideas.p

Negative 1763 pI am aware that a CALayers shadowPath is only animatable using explicit animations, however I still cannot get this to work. I suspect that I am not passing the codetoValuecode properly  as I understand this has to be an codeidcode, yet the property takes a CGPathRef. Storing this in a codeUIBezierPathcode does not seem to work. I am using the following code to testp  precodeCABasicAnimation theAnimation  [CABasicAnimation animationWithKeyPathshadowPath] theAnimation.duration  3.0 theAnimation.toValue  [UIBezierPath bezierPathWithRectCGRectMake10.0, 10.0, 50.0, 50.0] [self.view.layer addAnimationtheAnimation forKeyanimateShadowPath] codepre  pI am using minus values so as to ensure the shadow extends beyond a view that lies on top of it... the layers codemasksToBoundscode property is set to codeNOcode.p  pHow is animation of the shadowPath achievedp  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pProblem emnearlyem solved. Unfortunately, the main problem was a somewhat careless error...p  pThe mistake I made was to add the animation to the root layer of the view controller, rather than the layer I had dedicated to the shadow. Also, pe8ter was correct in that the codetoValuecode needs to be a codeCGPathRefcode cast to codeidcode obviously when I had tried this before I still had no animation due to the wrong layer mistake. The animation works with the following codep  precodeCABasicAnimation theAnimation  [CABasicAnimation animationWithKeyPathshadowPath] theAnimation.duration  3.0 theAnimation.toValue  id[UIBezierPath bezierPathWithRectmyRect].CGPath [controller.shadowLayer addAnimationtheAnimation forKeyshadowPath] codepre  pI appreciate this was difficult to spot from the sample code I provided. Hopefully it can still be of use to people in a similar situation though.p  pHowever, when I try and add the linep  precodecontroller.shadowLayer.shadowPath  [UIBezierPath bezierPathWithRectmyRect].CGPath codepre  pthe animation stops working, and the shadow just jumps to the final position instantly. Docs say to add the animation with the same key as the property being changed so as to override the implicit animation created when setting the value of the property, however shadowPath cant generate implicit animations... so how do I get the new property to stay emafterem the animationp

Negative 1763 pIm working at a company that uses Perforce, and find it really annoying that when I edit something locally for a purely local purpose maybe I want to change a path to point to something local for testing, etc..., that change is automatically added to my pending changelist and winds up cluttering it up.

It also makes it look to others like Im editing the file and plan to upload it back to the depot, when this isnt at all my intent.

Negative 1763 pBack in World War II and WWI apparently, encryption schemes used by the warring parties kept getting cracked.  Then some genius who understood language realized that sending messages in an esoteric natural language would be better than any cipher, due to the enormous differences that languages can bear to one another in terms of syntaxe.g. Navajo vs. Japanese.  Codes based on Navajo went uncracked.  The title is a movie reference.p  pSo you can see where this is going.  Whats a good language, emwith an available native compilerem, that few people know yet is powerful enough in which to write, say, a key authentication module  I thought of Cobol but couldnt find a native compiler, by which I mean a compiler that compiles directly into machine language and not by first translating into C or some other standard language and then compiling the C.p  pI realize that at the assembly level its probably all the same, but I still think being able to write unreadable highlevel code might help in some situations.p

So I create a constructor and also a private default constructor for the serializer.p  precode[Serializable] public class TestClass      public int Variable      private TestClass       public TestClassint value              Variable  value            codepre  pSo in the code where Im using this, default parameters become handy. So I applied that technique to the public constructor.p  precode[Serializable] public class TestClass      public int Variable      private TestClass       public TestClassint value  0              Variable  value            codepre  pAnd this all works fine, but why Do we dont have now two constructors with the same definition Even if I make the default constructor public, everything works fine. Once I remove the default constructor, it fails on serialisation. My first guess is that the XmlSerialize of .NET doesnt check for constructors with default parameters. But why does the compiler still allows this codep  pIm just curious on this, but also hope to learn and better understand how things work internally. Googling doesnt bring up anything useful, maybe just because I couldnt think about the right search terms.p

Either that or Im missing something blatantly obvious.p  pUnfortunately googlefu turns out badly on this subject as everyone suggests one of two thingsp  ul lijQuerys code.livecode or code.delegatecode catchall event handlers. This is just scary on a fundamental level. code.delegatecode wouldnt be so bad, but this requires that the pluginwidgetcontrolwhatever be entirely event driven. This would work in a lot of cases for sure, but not in others. It also makes following amp organizing the code very complex. I wont even go into code.livecode, for large complex sites, the event bubbling is slow amp when you get enough components together, the list of queries to match becomes large making each clickfocuswhatever event incrementally slower on the whole for the entire page.li liWork arounds that involve plugins like a hrefhttpdocs.jquery.comPluginslivequeryliveQuerya, which is a very cool plugin for sure but it primarily seems to have been designed to solve a different issue the issue of new items being brought in by ajaxdom creation, and still will get incrementally slower the more queries that stack up that need to be checked against.li ul  h2Conclusionh2  pThere emhasem to be a better way, I know there has to be one. Ive exhausted my google fu on the subject, and still cannot find ideasconceptsexamplesdiscussion that is newer than jQuery 1.3.2 or with a grand picture in mind. In a perfect world this wouldnt be a problem because everyone would use intelligent browsers with modern standards amp a decent javascript engine, and code.classcode queries wouldnt take eons and eons, but unfortunately this is not the case.p  pIm looking for ideas on how to tackle this, after going through many SO questions similar to this, and many articles on various jquery techniques I feel that if the information is out there its buried underneath the many false positives amp 101 best jquery plugin results that turn up in any search with jQuery. I know emsomeoneem out there has ran into this predicament.p  pIdeas, links, examples, anything is welcome, there just has to be a better way.p

Negative 1763 pWere starting to experiment with implementing our backend services using CDI. The scenario is thisp  pEJB with Startup is started when EAR deployed.

Negative 1763 pI have a mysql SELECT query which is fast lt0.1 sec but only the first time I run it.  It joins 3 tables together using indices and has a relatively simple WHERE statement.  When I run it by hand in the phpmyadmin always changing numbers in the WHERE so that it isnt cached it is always fast but when I have php run several copies of it in a row, the first one is fast and the others hang for 400 sec.

Negative 1763 pIm trying to use dynamic sets to handle the way Excel 2010 does subqueries when using filters, but Im running into what seems to be a strange bug in the MDX query engine.p  pSuppose I have a time hiearchy with Year  Month  Date. I then create a dynamic set usingp  precodeCREATE DYNAMIC SET CURRENTCUBE.[YMDDS] AS [Time].[YMD].[Date]                     codepre  pI then use this dynamic set as followingp  precodeCREATE MEMBER CURRENTCUBE.[Measures].[TestCount] AS SumExisting [YMDDS], 1, VISIBLE  1 codepre  pIf I open excel 2010 and add the testcount key figure and put YMD hierarchy in my report filter, filter this to say January 21 2012, January 22 2012, Feb 12 2012 I get 3 as it should. But if I change this to December 21 2011, January 22 2012, Feb 12 2012 so that it spans a year, I will get around 1500 or as many days as there are in the time dimension It works fine with spanning weeks and months but not year Its the same if I use count on the set. The strange thing is that it sometimes works, e.g. if I select the whole of 2011. p  pI have encountered this bug with two different cubes and 3 different hierarchies. If I have a hierarchy of Year tertial month week and day, it will work on year, tertial, week. But not month and day.p  pAny idea what is going on here p
Negative 1763 pI am using a Sharepoint 2007 customized people picker control for a webpart codePickerDialogcode, codeCustomQueryControlcode, codeEntityEditorWithPickercode.

Negative 1763 pWhat Im asking for may be different than a group push where the collection of clients normally remain relatively constant.  p  pIn a notification system, clients can create events that not all other clients are subscribed to.  For example, a client indicates that they dont want to receive notifications of new logins, but wants to know when a new photo is published from only certain users.  The combinations are endless, and created on the fly, so you cant do a group push.p  pOn each event, a new collection of clients will be created that will receive a notification.  Is there a way to accomplish this with a bulk push rather than individual private messagesp  pWould the way to implement this be to create groups on the fly on the server side, add clients to that group then send a message to that groupp  pThanks.p

Negative 1763 pbasically what I have is 4 divs, that each start at a set height and when you mouseover them, they animate to make the div taller, thus showing the background image in full rather than just a sneak peak of the image as shown originally.

The JNIExport is just a way to have the Java code interact with the c code, from what I imagine.p  pAnyway, now my issue is that in debugging or running the app on the phone once I press button1 the activity closes and goes back to my main menu activity. In Debug it says .... DalvikVM[localhost8602] and in DDMS the device stays Online. The LogCat does not output any thing to suggest that the activity exitedcrashed. And upon entering the SetupTunTap activity LogCat resumes by displaying information but never outputs anything when button1 is pressed and the screen flashes black and reverts to my main menu activity. Here is the part, in the LogCat, at which the liblmytunserv is loadedp  pLogCat Outputp  precode...  0730 163019.531 Ddalvikvm4716 Trying to load lib datadataandroidspapi.samplelibliblmytunserv.so 0x41688d20  0730 163019.531 Ddalvikvm4716 Added shared lib datadataandroidspapi.samplelibliblmytunserv.so 0x41688d20  0730 163019.531 Ddalvikvm4716 No JNIOnLoad found in datadataandroidspapi.samplelibliblmytunserv.so 0x41688d20, skipping init codepre  pHow do I debug further If I set a breakpoint at myTun.runtunipaddress then I can see all the variables in the Debug interface on Eclipse. If I proceed past that point, the activity disconnects and I only see the .so lib file load in the LogCat.

Negative 1763 pBefore I begin, my apologies if the wording of this questions title is confusing.  I hope my explanation here will make it much clearer.p  pIn a JSF template of my application, I want to include another template and pass a parameter to it that holds the results of an application method.  In this parent template, I havep  precodeltuirepeat varloopObject valueApplicationBean.objectListgt     ltuiinclude srcanotherTemplate.xhtmlgt         ltuiparam namefirstParam              valueApplicationBean.initForOtherTemplateloopObject gt     ltuiincludegt ltuirepeatgt codepre  pIt turns out, though, that codeinitForOtherTemplatecode is not executed at this point and codefirstParamcode contains a reference to that method, rather than its return value, as I expected.p  pActually, while codeinitForOtherTemplatecode does have a return value, codeanotherTemplate.xhtmlcode doesnt need it.  However,the method does set up some other objects in codeApplicationBeancode that this new template will use.  For example, it sets values for codeimportantInfocode and codeimportantInfoToocode, which the other template needs.p  pcodeanotherTemplate.xhtmlcode containsp  precodeltuiremovegt     lt      When a parameter contains a method call, the method isnt executed until     the parameter is referenced.  So we reference the parameter here and ignore     the results.  There must be a better way.     gt ltuiremovegt lthoutputText valuefirstParam styledisplay none gt lthoutputText valueApplicationBean.importantInfo gt lthoutputText valueApplicationBean.importantInfoToo gt codepre  pIf this template didnt reference codefirstParamcode, then codeimportantInfocode and codeimportantInfoToocode wouldnt be set or have unpredictable values.  This is very disappointing, because I expected codeinitForOtherTemplatecode to be executed in the parent template, rather than here, which feels messy.p  pHow can I get the assignment of the parameter to actually execute the method immediately rather than store a reference to itp

Note that the next line compiles just fine.p  pQ1 This in itself is strange to me. I thought initialisation with an assignment was transformed into initialisation with an initialiser when necessary. Why could the first fail if the second succeedsp  pQ2 But the real puzzle for me is that the failing line succeeds when I emremoveem a constructor from the codeautoarrayptrcode class the codeautoarrayptrautoarrayptrcode constructor. I really have a hard time understanding whats happening here.p  pI can sort of imagine a scenario here of what the compiler might be trying to do herep  p1 look for a void codeoperatorchar pcode. Not found. Lets see if we can promote the argument codebuffercode. 2 ah ah, there is an codeoperatorautoarrayptrampcode. So I win if I can promote codebuffercode to an codeautoarrayptrcode. Lets look for a constructor to do that. 3 ah ah there is a codeautoarrayptrautoarrayptrampcode constructor. So lets construct a temporary variable from codebuffercode using that constructor codetempcode. 4 now try to use the codeoperatorautoarrayptrampcode, method. But bummer its argument is not codeconstcode, and I cant actually use it. Report an error.p  pBut this scenario is not convincing. For one, the compiler could notice the codeconstcode problem is step 2. Also, it could use the codeautoarrayptrchar code directly rather than trying to promote  codebuffercode. Then, if I add a codeoperatorchar pcode to the class, the error doesnt go away. Finally, that doesnt explain why emremovingem the codeautoarrayptrautoarrayptrampcode helps.p  pOf course you need the source of codeautoarrayptrcode. here it isp  precodetemplateltclass Tgt class autoarrayptr  public     autoarrayptrT p  0  ptrp      autoarrayptrautoarrayptrltTgtamp a  ptra.release    remove this line to compile     autoarrayptr ifptr  0 delete[] ptr ptr  0      void operatorautoarrayptrltTgtamp a ifampa  this reseta.release     void operatorT p  ifp  ptr resetp     adding this doesnt help      Tamp operator[]int i const return ptr[i]     Tamp operator[]unsigned int i const return ptr[i]     operator T const return ptr     T get const return ptr      T release T tmp  ptr ptr  0 return tmp      void resetT p  0 ifptr  0 delete[] ptr ptr  p  private     T ptr  codepre  pThe compiler is a recent version of Clang running in Xcode 4.4 under Mac OS X Lion.

Negative 1763 pI have an iPad application that will display a popover using custom artwork. From an earlier question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11762832custompopoverwithpatternborderCustom popover with pattern bordera, I learned about the UIPopoverBackgroundView class. But its not clear to me how I am supposed to provide my images.p  pMy designer provided me with a single image, which is easy enough to slice into components. If I simply implement drawRect in a UIPopoverBackgroundView subclass, I can use nonstretched left and right images and a stretched center image. But then its not clear how I provide my custom arrow image which points up as presentation of the arrow is derived from the base class properties.p  pI looked at UIPopoverBackgroundView.h but I dont see any methods or properties that refer to images, just properties of the view.p  pAm I going about this the right way Does UIPopoverBackgroundView actually let me provide complete background images for a custom popover appearance How do I provide my custom images to a UIPopoverBackgroundView subclass Do I need to instead subclass UIView to achieve a completely custom popover appearancep  pI am currently targeting iOS 5.p  pEdit I also found another question, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8205846usinguipopoverbackgroundviewclassusing UIPopoverBackgroundView classa.

Negative 1763 pI noticed that when a window is handling the KeyDown event raised by a text box in it and set the event Handled flag to true, the text box ignores the pressed key and doesnt add it to its content.p  pAccording to my understanding of how things work, the PreviewKeyDown event if first tunneling from the window to the TextBox and then the KeyDown event is bubbling up from the TextBox to the window. By the time the windows event handler gets to set the Handled event, the event is no longer handled by the TextBox, but I do see that it has an effect, and pressed keys are not added to the TextBox.p  pCan someone explain how this worksp  pthis is a general question, but was raised after I saw a similar behavior in a thirdparty control we are using, and it caused me problems, as I wanted the control to handle the event but stop it from bubbling upwards.p

Negative 1763 pThe program Im working on is essentially a receipt maker for a restaurant. There is a drop down list which contains a bunch of foods taken from an array. The array includes the price for each item, and as of right now, the program will display any food item selected from the dropdown, list the individual prices, and add them up for a total. The problem I have is if someone selects the same item more than once, I have no way to register the quantity of said item. Basically, I need some code that checks the current selection against the past selections to see if their are any duplicates. I dont really know how to do that. a hrefhttpsgist.github.com3881162 relnofollowHerea is my code so far. Please take a look and pass on any advice. Thanks.p

As far as I understand that ConcurrentHashMap locks the segment independently, so for example, Thread1 writes to the segment1 slightly before Thread2 writes to segment2, and what happen if it requires the table to resize and rehash after Thread1 insertion, but Thread2 is in the middle of the writing operation  does it lock the whole map for rehashing  and does it have something like tell Thread2 to stop and wait until the rehash is done  because Thread2 may have a chance end up writing segment1 after the table resize, correct   p

Negative 1763 pIve been reading up on virtual environment, and it seems like an extremely useful tool, but now Im questioning how Ive set up my entire python environment thus far. Right now, all of the modules and packages that I have installed are residing in this directory p  precodeLibraryFrameworksPython.frameworkVersions2.7libpython2.7sitepackages codepre  pBut the virtualenv docs seem to suggest that such universal system installs are a bad thing.

Should I have done something different Im having trouble with the documentation, which seems to suggest that I need to go into a project directory, set up a virtual environment, and install all of the modules that I need using virtualenv. Is this the case Is there any way to make things less cumbersome It seems like installing potentially dozens of packages for every single project directory would be a little much. p  pOr is it the case that I only need to create virtual environments for projects that use older versions of modules than the ones I have installed in the system directory If thats the case, however, then whats up with the virtualenv mantra that seems to discourage all system installs p

Yes, you read correct, an codeNOT HAPPENING EVENTcode.p  pembelowem you find my allready working solution in jQuery.br The idea is to have strongcontroll over not happening Eventsstrong and to react on that via this extra specified a hrefhttpapi.jquery.comcategoryeventseventobject relnofollowcodejQuery.Eventcodeap  pHehe, i know most stupid would be to handle codeonnoerrorcode Events with this. But thats not desired. Its working now and i want to go a step forward here. So what is my problemp  pstrongHere it comesstrong How to fire the same behavior with codenative javascript EventListeningcode so codeelement.addEventListener...code can handle the same Events toop  pstrongProblemstrong newer Webbrowser like Chrome, FF have an implemented codeCustomEventcode handling to make this happen, but in older browsers there should be a way with prototype or so.  Im a bit jQuery blind now, anyway is there somebody out there who knows the freaky trick to generate Custom Events in a traditional way strongwithoutstrong prototype.js or other librarys Even a solution with jQuery would be fine, but desired goal is the native Listener should be able to handle it.p  pThank you for taking away my blurry sunglasses herep  pjQueryp  precodefunction     .fn.extend          extends jQuery with the opposite Event Listener         onnofunctioneventname,t,fn             var onnotimer  null             var jqueryevent               this.on eventname, functione                 window.clearTimeoutonnotimer                 function OnNoEventFn                     jqueryevent  jQuery.Event onnoeventname                      this.triggerjqueryevent                     e.timeStampVisione.timeStampt                     e.timert e.typeonnoeventname                     fne                                  onnotimer  window.setTimeout OnNoEventFn, t                          return this               jQuery  document.readyfunction       installs onnomousemove and fires after 5sec if mousemove does not happen.     window.onnomousemove, 5000, functione         console.logfunction fires aftere.timerms ate.timeStampVisionms withe.type event, exact fired, e.timeStamp           installs onnoclick and fires after 4sec if click does not happen.     window.onnoclick, 4000, functione         console.logfunction fires aftere.timerms ate.timeStampVisionms withe.type event, exact fired, e.timeStamp            just for demonstration, routine with onno.. eventnamescheme     window.ononnomousemove,functione         console.log tadaaaa e.type works with jQuery Event,e           same for onnoclick     window.ononnoclick,functione         console.log tadaaaa e.type works with jQuery Event,e         but how to install Custom Events even in older Safari   newer Chrome, FF amp Opera have CustomEvent. window.addEventListeneronnomousemove,functione     console.lognative js is watching you,e ,false codepre
Negative 1763 pI am implemented In App Billing for android.I wanted to implement subscription validity checking through my backend server. As Google Play Documentation, for making call for Google Play API,need authentication using oauth 2.0.p  pI followed instructions for registering project and creating credentials.

Negative 1763 pI might be wrong on this, but it appears that my WAV file in NAudio is playing asynchronously, and if I call it from a library, I can hear the WAV start, but it exits and stops playing almost immediately.p  pIf I run it from a Form which stays open it is fine.

And I would like a solution that does not use codeevalcode, as it is pernicious...p  pUPDATEp  pthanks for the answer, Ryan... that pretty much did it  the problem with eval was that it is no good at catching the current scope... this way i can do stuff like p  precode    let [a 1]         begin             defmethod add x integer y integer  x y a             add 1 2      codepre  pwhich would fail miserably with eval... this is just an academic example, but i think it is a good test for correctness.p

Negative 1763 pmy website has several audio players on one page. Mostly these audio players would depend on an html5 codeltaudiogtcode element, however for some sites there is an flash  codeltobjectgtcode fallback. I was thinking to include volume controls for each player, but than thought That I can use one Universal volume control for all of them as there can be only one player playing at a time I tried researching this topic, but could not find any useful information. Therefore I decided to ask the community, is there a way to, no matter if it is codeltaudiogtcode or flash fallback, to control volume of the whole website Maybe jQuery solution, some html5 magic Or what needs to be done in order for this to workp  pPlayers are based on this plugin a hrefhttpkolber.github.ioaudiojsdocs relnofollowhttpkolber.github.ioaudiojsdocsap  pEDIT Something very similar to sound cloud, they have volume control in the header, which controls all players.p

Negative 1763 pI have a bunch of polygons codegoogle.maps.Polygoncode that i have imported to a map. They lay edge to edge and share vertexes so there is no empty area in between you can imagine countryborders, or zipcodeareas, so its kind of like a grid. p  pNow, I want my users to be able to edit this grid When one movies a vertex of a polygon from position x1, y1 to x2, y2, then all other vertexes of the other polygons on that same location x1, y1 should move to the new location x2, y2.p  pAny ideas of how I can accomplish thisp  pThis is what I have tried I can make the polygon codeeditable truecode, which will allow the user to drag the vertexes, but not all polygons vertexes will follow.p  pI tried to ad a codesetatcode listener for the polygons that, once a vertex has been moved, loops throw the other polygons and check if they have a vertex with the same coordinates as the start, and if so, move that coordinate to the new location. Problem is that I dont know how to get the startcoordinate of the moved coordinate, only the endcoordinate. p  pIs there a better way to solv this problem than using polygons, like a gridp  pHuge thanks for helpp

Negative 1763 pLets say Im working on a refresh of the UI for my app so I have a branch called v2 to cover all of the code for that project.p  pNow lets say that I have a branch called v2123 representing a particular feature in user story 123, and that my work is more or less complete but is awaiting QA testing approval.p  pLets then say that I have another user story 456 which is blocked by user story 456 in that I need the changes in story 123 to be able to work on the changes for 456.p  pWould it be viable to create branch v2456 off of v2123 knowing that its likely QA testing on 123 will complete before I finish working on 456 Would there be problems with then squashing v2123 back into v2, immediately rebasing v2456 with v2 and then later down the line merging v2456 back onto v2p  pOr would it be better to just wait until v2123 has been squashed back onto v2 and branch v2456 off of v2 The key thing is that I wouldnt want the merging of v2123 back onto v2 to be held up by having to complete v2456 first I want to be able to merge v2123 onto v2 as soon as QA testing comes back successful.p  pThanks.p

Negative 1763 pI am working on a function Export data from sql server database to Excel in MVC3, I want to select data based on certain conditions and then export the selected data to excel. Now I have achieved the following function, say, in the screenshot, if I select Will expire this month and then submit,  it will only display members who will expire this month in the excel, not all the Members. If I select two dates in the calendar, it only displays members who expires between the two selected dates. Also, I can export data from database to excel based on the sql statement. The problem is I can write sql statement for exporting all the data from database to excel, not based on the conditions expire this week, expiry this month.... I post my codes.

Negative 1763 pOkay so i am making a Voice chat software. I am using NAudio for it, an excellent library.p  pBut i got a problem. The buffer can go up when something happens. I guess its from example, when the OS loads something and the Voice Chat application is put on hold for a sec. During that time, it adds the data in the buffer, making the current data get delayed.p  pAnd as the receiver is playing at the same pace all the time, it will always be delayed.p  pNow i have a solution for this, which is to clear the buffer when it reaches a certain length. Though this is not ideal at all, and is more of a trick than a solution.p  pNow to the code parts. First i initialize the things i use.p  precode        private NAudio.Wave.WaveInEvent SendStream  new WaveInEvent         private NAudio.Wave.AsioOut Aut         private NAudio.Wave.WaveFormat waveformat  new WaveFormat48000, 16, 2         private WasapiLoopbackCapture Waloop  new WasapiLoopbackCapture         private NAudio.Wave.BufferedWaveProvider waveProvider    waveProvider  new NAudio.Wave.BufferedWaveProviderwaveformat                 waveProvider.DiscardOnBufferOverflow  true                  SendStream.WaveFormat  waveformat codepre  pwaveformat is used just so i dont have to rewrite it all the time. DiscardOnBufferOverflow is used so if i set a certain lenght on the buffer, for example 20ms. It will Discard anything above, else it will return an exception. I think however it doesnt do anything if i dont set a length, its probably infinite at default.p  pAnd not much else, SendStream is a WaveInEvent, meaning it will run on a BackgroundThread when i use DataAvailable.  Waloop is pretty much the same except its a loopback. waveprovider is used in the receiving part to play back the audio. Waveformat is, well waveformat, its importat to set it out, and have all the same, at least in my application.p  pHere is the receiving part. As you can se, it puts the data in a byte array, then plays it. nothing weird.p  precode   byte[] byteData  udpClient.Receiveref remoteEP    waveProvider.AddSamplesbyteData, 0, byteData.Length codepre  pHere is the sendingrecording part.p  precode  private void Sendv2              try                      if connect  true                              if AudioDevice  Wasapi Loopback                                      SendStream.StopRecording                     Waloop.StartRecording                                  else                                      Waloop.StopRecording                     SendStream.StartRecording                                                catch Exception e                      MessageBox.Showe.Message                void Sendingobject sender, NAudio.Wave.WaveInEventArgs e                    if connect  true ampamp MuteMic.Checked  false                            udpClient.Sende.Buffer, e.BytesRecorded, otherPartyIP.Address.ToString, 1500                      void SendWaloopobject sender, NAudio.Wave.WaveInEventArgs e                 byte[] newArray16Bit  new byte[e.BytesRecorded  2]            short two            float value            for int i  0, j  0 i lt e.BytesRecorded i  4, j  2                            value  BitConverter.ToSinglee.Buffer, i                two  shortvalue  short.MaxValue                 newArray16Bit[j]  bytetwo amp 0xFF                newArray16Bit[j  1]  bytetwo gtgt 8 amp 0xFF                        if connect  true ampamp MuteMic.Checked  false                            udpClient.SendnewArray16Bit, newArray16Bit.Length, otherPartyIP.Address.ToString, 1500                      codepre  pWaloop is a Loopback, so it goes through another channel, but its not really important here.p  pVery simple, When data is available when its recording and if the connect is true etc, it will just send the buffer.p  pSo pretty much like the receiver part but other way around.p  pNow how i currently solve this is like thisp  precode if waveProvider.BufferedDuration.Milliseconds gt 40                               waveProvider.ClearBuffer                 TimesBufferClear              codepre  pSo i am clearing the buffer if its above 40ms this is in a Timer at 600ms interval. TimesBufferClear is just so i can keep track of the times it had been clearedp  pNow sadly, i have no idea how to prevent the buffer to be increased, and setting it to a forced state 20ms etc will just cause the playback to be worse and worse the higher up the buffer goes as it doesnt really stop, it just ignores the part above i think.p  pHere is the creationg of the input devices. It is a bit different from ASIO and Wasapi in my implementation, but it pretty much works the same, only real difference is that i tell the UI that ASIO is on or off as you can see in the code, at the end i add the DataAvailable events to both SendStream any input, Microphone etc and Waloop Loopback sound thats being played.p  precode  private void CheckAsio               if NAudio.Wave.AsioOut.isSupported                       Aut  new NAudio.Wave.AsioOut             ASIO.Text  nSupported   Aut.DriverName             ASIO.ForeColor  System.Drawing.Color.Green             Aut.InitwaveProvider             Aut.Play             SendStream.NumberOfBuffers  2             SendStream.BufferMilliseconds  10                  else                       AsioSettings.Enabled  false             ASIO.Text  n Not Supported Wasapi used             ASIO.ForeColor  System.Drawing.Color.DarkGray             Wasout  new WasapiOutAudioClientShareMode.Shared, 0             Wasout.InitwaveProvider             Wasout.Play             SendStream.NumberOfBuffers  2             SendStream.BufferMilliseconds  9                  SendStream.DataAvailable  Sending         Waloop.DataAvailable  SendWaloop       codepre  pI am not sure if this even can be solved. But as i dont see other voice chat programs have it, i am guessing there must be something that can be done.p

Is there any predefined function in the POI library that can do this task or the only option left out is to iterate over every individual record and then compare with already existing ones to determine the new ones. Thanks.p
Negative 1763 pSetting Im using Lua from a CC environment. p  pI have several lua files on disk. Those are read into memory and some more memoryonly lua files become available during runtime. Think e.g. of an editor, with additional unsaved lua files.p  pSo, I have a codelistltidentifier, luafilecontentgtcode in memory. Some of these files have coderequirecode statements in them. When I try to load all these files to a lua instance currently via codeluadostringcode I get codeattempt to call global require a nil valuecode. p  pIs there a possibility to provide a coderequirecode function, which replaces the old one and just uses the provided in memory files those files are on the C side p  pIs there another way of allowing coderequirecode in these files without having the required files on diskp  pAn example would be to load the lua stdlib from memory only without altering it. This is actually my test case.p

Negative 1763 pWhile theres a lot of stuff floating out there about getting the return type of any templated callback functionmethod including lambdas of course, Im having an extremely hard time finding information about resolving the full call signature of a lambda function. At least in gcc 4.7 it seems to be an edge case where the normal tricks see below dont work. Heres what Im trying to do and have so far a stripped down version of course...p  precodetemplatelttypename Siggt struct invokabletype    templatelttypename R, typename...Asgt struct invokabletypeltRAs...gt     static constexpr sizet n  sizeof...As    typedef RcallabletypeAs...    templateltsizet igt    struct arg         typedef typename peeltypelti, As...gt type      codepre  pcodepeeltypeltsizet, typename...gtcode is not included here for brevity but its a simple argument type peeler I think theres one built in to C11, but I never bothered to look. Its unimportant for this question.p  pThen, of course, specializations and further propertiestypedefs exist for a myriad of callable types such as codeRAs...code, codeRampAs...code, codeRTAs...code, codestdfunctionltRAs...gtcode, method cv qualifiers, method lvaluervalue qualifiers, etc, etc, etc.p  pThen, somewhere down the road we have a lovely function or method function here, doesnt matter that looks like...p  precodetemplatelttypename C, typename...Asgt static void dosomethingCampamp callback, Asampamp...as      dosomethinghandlerltinvokabletypeltCgtn, As...gtsomethingstdforwardltCgtcallback, stdforwardltAsgtas...  codepre  pNever mind what codedosomethinghandlercode does... its entirely immaterial. The problem lies with lambda functions.p  pFor all possible generic invokable signatures Ive specialized for which appears to be all but nonSTL functors, this works beautifully when codedosomethingcode is called with them as the first argument template deduction fully works. However, lambda functions result in an uncaptured type signature, resulting in codeinvokabletypeltSiggtcode being used, which means things like codencode and codeargslt0gttypecode simply dont exist.p  pNotaproblem example...p  precodevoid somethingint x, int y      return x  y  codepre  p... and later...p  precodedosomethingsomething, 7, 23 codepre  pProblem example...p  precodedosomething[]int x, int y          return x  y     , 7, 23 codepre  pIf I understand lambda functions correctly, the compiler is emlikelyem to compile this lambda to a static function within the namespace of the defining scope gcc certainly seems to. For the life of me I cant figure out what the signature actually is though. It looks like it definitely has one that should be deducible via template specialization based on error reporting.p  pAnother tangential question is even if there is a signature I can use, how crosscompiler dangerous this this Are lambda compilation signatures standardized or is it all across the boardp

Negative 1763 pThis question is been on my mind for a while so time to let it out and see what what you guys you have to say about it.p  pIn CC the operator precedence is defined by the C specification but as with everything there may be backdoors or unknown  not well known things that the compilers may employ under the name of optimization which will mess up your application in the end.p  pTake this simple example p  precodebool CheckStringPtrconst char textData      return textData  textData[0]char0  codepre  pIn this case I test if the pointer is null emthenem I check the first char is zero, essentially this is a test for a zero length string. Logically the 2 operations are exchangeable but if that would happen in some cases it would crash with since its trying to read a nonexistent memory address.p  pSo the question is  is there emanythingem that enforces the order of how operatorsfunctions are executed, I know the safest way is to use 2 IFs below each other but this way should be the same strongassumingstrong that the evaluation order of the operators never ever change. So are compilers forced by the CC specification to not change the order of evaluation or are they sometimes allowed to change the order, like it depends on compiler parameters, optimizations especiallyp

Negative 1763 pHello stackoverflow community. I need to build a PHP app using oDesk API, I know that oDesk has a report section where I can retrieve the Worked hours of all the contractors in all the contracts, these reports gives me a table that I can download in a CSV format, after this I can format it and print it however I need to do this several times a day, and I really would like to automatize this using oDesk API and PHP, I need to get these reports from several computers, in different places, so for that reason I chose PHP.p  pBasically, my idea is build the PHP app and upload it to a hosting, so I will access to that app using a web browser and I will be able to print the reports from there. Ive already checked the developer documentation in oDesk, it is too old 2010 all the examples are old too, I followed the examples, of course first Ive generated the API keys, return url, I downloaded the libs for PHP from oDesk API site but when I try to execute the script it redirects to oDesk Authorization, so I authorize the app and after the site displays an orange page with Error code 1, with some funny message like Holy Guacamole, Nothing to do here Fellas, and others, it never redirects to Return Url that I setup with my API keys.p  pCan someone help me out with thisp  pMy code is index.phpp  precode    ltphp     require oDeskAPI.lib.php     secret      mysecreykey     apikey     myapikey     company     mycompanyid     url         httpswww.odesk.comapiteamv1teamrooms.company..json     api  new oDeskAPIsecret, apikey     apigtauth     params  arrayonline gt all     response  apigtgetrequesturl, params     data  jsondecoderesponse     vardumpdatagtteamroomgtsnapshot[0]gtreporturl codepre  pMy secret key, api key, and company id are correct.

Negative 1763 pstrongEDITstrongp  pA solution exists  opening the file with stdiosbinary instead of in text mode Despite the file being pure text solves the issue. tellg now reports the correct location, so seekg can now be used to go back to the same place.p  pstrongEND EDITstrongp  pA while back, we had a server issue. The primary server is fine but the secondary had a slight hiccup. We want to know whether anything was logged differently during that time.p  pWe know for a fact that there are emotherem differences between log files  they are of different length because of logging happening when one or the other has been down earlier. As such, we cannot do a straight linebyline compare  we might get thousands of lines out that are reported to be logged differently yet just be offset by two lines extra logged by one of the servers near the top without being logged by the other.p  pI am writing a program to compare the output text files based on their timestamps that is, go to the area around the timestamp where the hiccup occurred and compare linebyline only for that area.

Negative 1763 pI am creating an auction site.  Like most people who create a website I hope that someday I will have the problem of having too many users for one database server to handle.  Asp.net mvc is my front end.  I am using ravendb as my backend.  So far I have done quite a bit to implement my site.  I have the pages to allow users to post new items for sale, and I am getting into searching.  Really happy with the way ravendb makes query, search, and paging capability so easy.  Really great  p  pNext. Time to plan for scaling.  The obvious solution that the ravendb documentation seems to present is to use the really great, easy, intuitive a hrefhttpravendb.netdocs2.5serverscalingoutsharding relnofollowshardinga functionally built into Raven.  So I started down the path of sharding my dataset based on user zipcode.  This is the obvious shard key for me because I am planning for my users to only care about items in their near proximity.  Great  Done  So easy  Even seems like I will be able to adjust my shading strategy later on when I need to add more servers by adjusting my custom ShardResolutionStrategy.p  pNow we arrive at my questionproblem.  I obviously want to be able to return a paged result set of items from across my shards.  So I have been researching focusing on that without thinking of sorting yet.  In reading I have basically come up with nothing beyond a few short sentences on a hrefhttpsgroups.google.comforumsearchinravendbravendb2420sharding2420and2420pagingravendbjm8T4MpgXEkR2XvtOtIbsJ relnofollowMergeQueryResultsa.  I understand that this is a really advancedcomplex problem, but this is such a common case I have to believe that someone out there has done sharding and paging.  Can any point me at some example or documentation on how to use MergeQueryResults in a smart wayp  hr  pEditp  pTo narrow my questions, I am really just looking for an example or some documentation of how to do paging on a sharded data set with raven db.  I dont care what the example is, just something.  Either that or an acknowledgement that Ravendb is not a good tool for solving this kind of problem.  Stop teasing with This is hard.  I am well aware of that.p  hr  pSecond Editp  pIll also further clarify my issue that I am trying to get around with paging and sharding on Ravendb.  Here is my understanding from reading google group posts, comments and responses.  It could certainly be wrong but I cant seems to find anything on the subject. Lets say my page size is 50.  If I want to return page 5 from a collection sharded across 3 servers, the default behavior of raven db is to return all 5 pages not just the results on page 5 from each 3 servers. i.e. 50  5 pages  3 servers  750 results which are all returned to the client for further processing to figure out which results are actually for page 5.  Obviously higher page numbers, more servers means that this is really impractical if you are trying to horizontally scale using sharding.  Is my understanding correct  Is there any way using an index or X feature that I am not aware of to limit the result setp

You should not use this function in a shipping application, although it may be useful during development.           Typical reasons for an error here include           The persistent store is not accessible           The schema for the persistent store is incompatible with current managed object model.          Check the error message to determine what the actual problem was.            If the persistent store is not accessible, there is typically something wrong with the file path. Often, a file URL is pointing into the applications resources directory instead of a writeable directory.           If you encounter schema incompatibility errors during development, you can reduce their frequency by           Simply deleting the existing store          [[NSFileManager defaultManager] removeItemAtURLstoreURL errornil]            Performing automatic lightweight migration by passing the following dictionary as the options parameter          NSMigratePersistentStoresAutomaticallyOptionYES, NSInferMappingModelAutomaticallyOptionYES           Lightweight migration will only work for a limited set of schema changes consult Core Data Model Versioning and Data Migration Programming Guide for details.

Negative 1763 pI am not sure how to put this question without it being wordy and confusing. I want to store a variable inside of another variable, and have those variables be specific to their home variable basically creating a directory. Say I have three characters, Max, Sam, and Greg.

How would I do thisp  pI want Maxs cookies to be independent from Sams cookies. However, I still want to be able to write a general method that can increase everyones cookies.p  precode def givecookies    cookiescookies1  codepre  pBut then I want to be able to call how many cookies Max has. So, is there a way I can store a variable inside another variable, and then how do I call it Like, instead of puts cookies, could I do something like puts Maxcookiesp  pIm sorry for the awkwardness of the question. Ive only been programming a few weeks, and I am still trying to pick up on the basics. There is probably a method out there for it, but I dont know what to look for.p

Negative 1763 pIm coming behind another developer who built a PhoneGapCordova HTML 5 application, currently only targeting IOS. Admittedly, I have zero experience with Cordova and hybrid mobile apps.p  pI can open up the XCode IDE and run the application and I can see the web page application load up in the iPad emulator, so long as I have his Node.js application running.p  pI guess Im confused about the context in which the actual index.html that makes up the HTML 5 application runs. Does it run on the iPad under a mini web server codehttplocalcode or codehttplocalhostcode or does the index.html run on a file system path something like codefilepathtofileindex.htmlcodep  pIve used Icenium Telerik AppBuilder and created an empty project for which I copied all the HTML 5 code into and ran it. Upon inspectingdebugging the page in the emulator, I see that the page is being served up with a base URL of codehttplocalcode.p  pLastly, I simply tried opening the index.html by doubleclicking it and running it in the browser codefile...buildsioswwwindex.htmlcode, and the application didnt work p  pIn summary, as long as I run the website in an emulator, the application loads and runs file, but it wont run loading it from the file system. p  pMy assumption is the scripts are expecting an http base URL and the file url is throwing it off. Does this sounds like a reasonable explanationp  pDo Cordova apps run the HTML 5 apps under HTTPp  pThank you.p

Negative 1763 pI have a codeJPanelcode to which I add an codejava.awt.Appletcode. If I add an input listener, like a codeMouseListenercode directly to the panel, I will be able to receive events when I click on the blank panel, as expected. However, when I add the applet, which completely fills the panel, the listener no longer picks up mouse clicks, presses, etc. So I figured that I would try adding the codeMouseListenercode to the actual applet, but the listener did not receive any events when I clicked on the applet. I know for a fact that the applet uses listeners of its own, but I dont think that would be the cause of this, though possible.p  pI tried using a glass pane with the codeJFramecode containing the panel, and then adding a codeMouseListenercode to the glass frame and delegating input events to the component lying directly under the point at which the event occurred. I figured that way I would be able to receive events but not lose functionality. However, I found that method to be a little messy and I could not get it to work. Ive also tried using the codesetComponentZOrdercode function but that was confusing to use and I could not get it to work either.p  pWhat am I doing wrong How can I capture input events from an codeAppletcode or a codeJPanelcode containing only an applet p  pThanks.p

Negative 1763 pI have a problem which involves using a small rank 2 array array2 in code below to hold an ordered list of some of the elements of a much larger rank 4 array array1 below. At the moment, one of my steps involves the use of a DOloop, and Im wondering whether it is possible to do this in one step using some sort of arraytoarray operation In the main code Im writing, Ive found that using such arraytoarray operations wherever possible has led to significant speed increases. Ive got the feeling that this is a simple problem, but I cannot see a solution or find one online. Id gratefully appreciate any help The following code is a simplified model of the problem, but contains the essential feature.

I could update every field to a bigger length and this would probably fix it but id rather not.

But i would like to get more specific suggestions or answer here. p  pProblem is, i have developed my home screen for 5 inch phonelike nexus 4 , so its looking pretty well on it. When i run the same app in 4 inch phonelike nexus s, the home screen got not looks like in 5 phone. Its so weird and some of buttons, views are not fitted. What should i do now  Ive also tried to create a separate layout folder like layout320dp and layoutnormal. Both screens comes under the HDPI part, so i cant create a separate layout folder. Added, i used more image views on my home screen and given more specific number values for padding purpose.If i reduce image size in drawable folder means i can get pretty UI on 4 inches too. p

It involved two ships, ltemphasis typeitalicgtvizltemphasisgt the Calandra owned by the plaintiff and the Rainbow owned by the defendant. The Rainbow sank as a result of the collision and the Calandra suffered damage. The parties have filed preliminary acts in which they blamed each other for the collision.ltparagt             ltparagtltlabelgt2.ltlabelgt There is before me an application by the defendant for an order under O.75 r.1810 of the Rules of the High Court that the plaintiff do file and serve on the defendant particulars of the damages claimed and that the damages be assessed prior to the trial on liability.ltparagt             ltparagtltlabelgt3.ltlabelgt The rule clearly provides that the application must be made by summons to the Registrar even if it is made after the issue of a case management summons.ltparagt             ltparagtltlabelgt4.ltlabelgt This is to be contrasted with O.75 r.251c which says the Case Management Conference CMC shall be heard by a judge in person, unless a judge in person otherwise directs.ltparagt             ltparagtltlabelgt5.ltlabelgt It seems to me the intention of the rules is reasonably clear CMC must be heard by a judge, whereas an application for the filing of particulars of damages and for assessment of damages shall be heard by the Registrar. ltparagt             ltparagtltlabelgt6.ltlabelgt The reason for this distinction is not difficult to understand the matters to be dealt with at the CMC are directions for trial of liability which is always heard by a judge. The assessment of damages is normally heard by the Registrar. In fact, O.75 r.1811 provides that where an order is made under para.10, the claim shall be treated as referred to the Registrar for assessment and rr.41 and 42 shall apply unless the Registrar otherwise directs. So it makes sense for the application under O.75 r.1810 to be heard by the Registrar as he would have to follow it up if he decides to make an order. ltparagt             ltparagtltlabelgt7.ltlabelgt The practice of this Court is to follow the rules as far as possible, with suitable flexibility if the circumstances of the case warrant it.ltparagt             ltparagtltlabelgt8.ltlabelgt For that reason alone, the application is defective. ltparagt             ltparagtltlabelgt9.ltlabelgt But I would not decide this application simply on such a basis. There is a more fundamental objection to the application. ltparagt             ltparagtltlabelgt10.ltlabelgt    It is a longestablished practice of the English admiralty court, after liability has been determined, to refer to the Registrar the matter of assessment of damages ltemphasis typeitalicgtHong Kong Civil Procedure 2013ltemphasisgt para.75412. It is also the norm in collision actions for there to be a trial of liability first before assessment of damages ltemphasis typeitalicgtMarsden Collisions at Sealtemphasisgt 13th ed., 2003, para.1801.ltparagt             ltparagtltlabelgt11.ltlabelgt    If this order is to be reversed, it would only be reversed if cogent reasons are put forward. ltparagt             ltparagtltlabelgt12.ltlabelgt    No such reasons exist in the present case. No doubt, because of that, Mr Kim for the defendant very properly concedes that he is not seeking a reference to the Registrar for assessment of damages in the present case. But if he is not seeking a reference to the Registrar at this stage, there is no other legal basis for the defendant to seek particulars of damages. As I said, O.75 r.1810 and 11 go hand in hand. Rule 1811 provides that where an order is made under para.10, the claim shall be treated as referred to the Registrar for assessment. If the defendant is not seeking a reference to the Registrar, there is no legal justification to make an order under r.1810 at all. ltparagt             ltpara breakyesgtltlabelgt13.ltlabelgt    For

Negative 1763 pIm adapting an old JS no framework  Rails app as an Ember learning exercise. The idea of the application is that Im producing a pdf from some data input. In the initial version, there was no user persistence  you could modify the data provided to you in the tables, and then download the PDF of it.p  pAs part of this, I decided to run with a decidedly nonstandard ember framework  Im essentially using Ember Data to load the initial value of the tables. Ember has been a really natural fit for the models I have on the Rails side, and its made a lot of the more complicated calculations a lot easier. The issue I have is that my initial idea was that when I came to download the PDF, Id respond to the save action on Ember Data with binary data with an applicationpdf header, which I could then use something like FileSaver.js to serve up to the client. Then, I found that EmberData needs JSON return value.p  pSo I base64 encoded my PDF response and fired it back..but it didnt fit the model schema. I thought Id then do a manual AJAX save p  precodeCalculateYourTV.RostersShowController  Ember.ObjectController.extend   actions     download function       var roster  this.getmodel       var team  roster.getteam       return this.ajaxURL GOES HERE, record.toJSON, PUT.thenfunctiondata          console.logcalled         console.logdata            ,     codepre  pAnd this is where Im currently stuck. Is there any way to access the URL that EmberData is posting to I could hardcode a route in the Rails side of things, but I dont like hardcoding routes in here, and Id like to keep it as reusable as possible Im planning to eventually allow data persistance.p

Are nodes in distributed environment pinged periodically with smaller intervals than codenetticktimecode or does the terminating node send some kind of message to other nodes before it terminates If it does send a message are there any scenarios when upon termination node cannot send this message and must be pinged to investigate its livelinessp  pAlso it is noted in Erlang documentation that Distributed Erlang is not very scalable for clusters larger than 100 nodes as every node keeps links to all nodes in the cluster. Is the algorithm for investigating liveliness of nodes pinging, announcing termination modified with increasing size of the clusterp

Negative 1763 pIm prototyping an ASP.NET Web API that needs to talk to several databases which are almost identical. Each of our customers have their own instance of our database structure, but some are specialized to integrate with other systems they have. So for example in one database the codeClientcode table might have the column codeAbcIDcode to reference a table in another system, but other databases wont have this column. Other than that the two tables are identical in name and columns. The columns can also have different lengths, codevarchar50code instead of codevarchar40code for example. And in some databases there can be one extra table. I have focused on solving the different columns problem first.p  pI was hoping to use an ORM to handle the data access layer of the API, and right now Im experimenting with Entity framework. I already solved how to dynamically connect to the different databases from an APIcall, but right now they have to be completely identical in structure.p  pI have tried to set up double .edmx models with a Databasefirst approach but this causes conflicting class names between the models.

Negative 1763 pI am working on a social network. I need to add a findfriends feature based on users phone number and their address book like whatsapp and others. p  pThe app I am developing will be available globally and I was wondering how others deal with the problem of predials and country codes. Of course I could find a way around but I am sure this is a relatively common challenge associated with that feature. The problem is, some people save numbers with a country code and some people dont. Do i need two versions of a phone number in my databasep  pWhat I think about doing p  p1 user registers with the number and types in the country code and the rest of the number separately two text fields. Then there are two separate columns in the database. One with the whole number including the country code and another with the number  excluding the country code.p  p2 Then another user looks for friends via its address book.  In the PHP, each number is checked and the ones that start with 00 are compared against the numbers in the column of the international numbers. Vice versa, the ones that dont start with 00 are compared against the number without the country code. This way users can find their friends irrespective of how they saved their number. p  pI would appreciate any help, links, advice or direction. I am looking for best practice approaches. p  pThanks p

Negative 1763 pI have a project that currently is using MVC5, WebApi2 and OWIN.  It has become quite a bit larger than I anticipated and I am looking into splitting it up into separate projects.  I will move the business logic and data access into a new project but then I was thinking about splitting the webapi and mvc into 2 more projects.  p  pReally, there is very little MVC.  Basically just the index.cshtml and the Help page.  Everything else is Durandal.  I was thinking if I were to move that out of the main project then then I would have some flexibility with hosting.  It just seems that the MVC part of the application is heavy and not needed.p  pI would then make a webapi project, which is really where everything is happening anyway.  p  pI have been considering using the OWIN pipeline and wrapping the webapi as middleware and the mvc project as middleware.  Then I could have multiple startup classes that could be used for different configurations.  One thing that I like about this idea is the webapi and the mcv app could be used individually or together.  In either case, because of the nature of OWIN, it can be self hosted or run through IIS.  p  pstrongNow my question is...strong Does this really make sense  There are potential cases for running the webapi service on its own.  Are there any potential losses I will have to take in a setup like thisp  pThanks.p

Negative 1763 pi have spent the last month or so developing a counter app as a companion app for score keeping to a card game that i play.p  pI am so close to finishing it but i cannot get my head around how i create a historylog of what buttons have been clicked. The app itself has 4 counters 2 per player and i want an activity that when accessed shows how many times a button has been clicked. For example, if one player has had 5 1 counters and the other has had 2 1 counters the history activity should show this, and for each add or subtract thereafter. If one player has 2 and then a few minutes later has another 2 i want it to say the total with the amount added each time next to it with a time that the button was pressed. For example like thisp  p173212  22  2p  p173443  25  3p  p173612  21  4p  p173951  15  6, and so on...p  pThe main activity holds all the counters buttons and textviews and i have a button in that activity that sends me to the history activity which i want all this data to be displayed in.

Negative 1763 pMy fledgling programming skills have hit a wall. I emcouldem get this working, but the code stinks and Im convinced there must be a more efficient way I just dont know it yet. p  pI have a web service that accepts the name of a data property as a parameter. Part of the method for handling the request is to go away and get me a load of data for the specified data property. In my case, it says go and get me the current years target and actual for the electricity usage property in the database.p  pIn my code this is just likep  precodevar data  rSvc.getDashboardPayloadworklocation, property, year codepre  pThe is then delivered as a JSON payload that just says snipped examplep  precode0   month 1 monthName Jan currentYearTarget 100 currentYearActual 90  codepre  pHowever, a change has come up that we need to produce a chart that is actually just a total of 4 measures in the database. For example Hazardous Waste is the total of nonmetallic waste, plus the total of metallic waste, plus the total of incinerated waste... and so on. You get the picture.p  pSo in my code I can get a payload for each measure like thisp  precodevar shwl  rSvc.getDashboardPayloadworklocation, propName, year var shwi  rSvc.getDashboardPayloadworklocation, propName, year var shmwr  rSvc.getDashboardPayloadworklocation, propName, year var shnmwr  rSvc.getDashboardPayloadworklocation, propName, year codepre  pThen I can create a new list that will be my outputp  precodevar merged  new ListltWLDChartsPayloadgt12 codepre  pThen I can loop through 12 months and go and total up each measure in turn.p  precodefor short i  1 i lt 13 i      var m  new WLDChartsPayload     m.currentYearActual  shwl.Wherex gt x.currentYearActual.HasValue ampamp x.month  i.FirstOrDefault.currentYearActual    m.currentYearActual  shwi.Wherex gt x.currentYearActual.HasValue ampamp x.month  i.FirstOrDefault.currentYearActual    m.currentYearActual  shmwr.Wherex gt x.currentYearActual.HasValue ampamp x.month  i.FirstOrDefault.currentYearActual    m.currentYearActual  shnmwr.Wherex gt x.currentYearActual.HasValue ampamp x.month  i.FirstOrDefault.currentYearActual     m.currentYearTarget  shwl.Wherex gt x.currentYearTarget.HasValue ampamp x.month  i.FirstOrDefault.currentYearTarget    m.currentYearTarget  shwi.Wherex gt x.currentYearTarget.HasValue ampamp x.month  i.FirstOrDefault.currentYearTarget    m.currentYearTarget  shmwr.Wherex gt x.currentYearTarget.HasValue ampamp x.month  i.FirstOrDefault.currentYearTarget    m.currentYearTarget  shnmwr.Wherex gt x.currentYearTarget.HasValue ampamp x.month  i.FirstOrDefault.currentYearTarget     merged.Addm   codepre  pThen I return the merged list.p  pBut this just feels wrong.

Negative 1763 pIve learned that NUGET will Always download the latest package and how to use the version switch.  However, on a recent project where different developers had different SUO files Visual Studio they would have the need to add other NUGET content to satisfy Build errors.  Yes we shouldnt be doing that .   p  pBut in attempting to clean up the mess, it seems as if NUGET does not clean up everything as it should.  I validated this by debugging an issue and finding that the Web.Config still had bad references just last week.  The problem of course is that the whole dependency chain on these packages is unknown  This creates circular dependency chains that are most likely the reason why when Uninstalling packages, there is leftover Dlls.  p  pHeres a case in point, last week we were so hosed up, I decided to reinstall MVC 4...  Couldnt figure out how to do that simple task other than to compare my last known working version and individually download version specific dlls.  And good luck in finding the more obscure packages which MSFT includes in their own MVC templates.   p  pJust wondering, what do you do, to make this fool proof and what advise can you give me to become an expert at controlling my reference librariesp

Negative 1763 pI have a star schema warehouse MS SQL Server, accessed via MS Report Builder with OLAP which has a lot of tiny dimensions  by this I mean the dimensions are built from two columns Id and Description with several hundred linked from the Fact tables. p  pThis provides the option of presenting all items off the Fact even when there is not an actual count against this return show nulls, however I am not convinced that this represents the data in the best possible way  I would rather see a small number of denormalised tables where the description was part of the Fact as this would provide better ability to query the data via SQL alongside the OLAP approach. p  pIs this structure of lots of one level dimensions normal and good practice To be honest the only time I would expect to show blanks are against something such as a time or date dimension, however as these can be coerced from the data to give you the gaps in charts and tables it does not really seem to matter that much. p  pAny views on if this structure is good or bad  I would like to try and get this changed but if I am out of step with the best practice I would happily change my mindset.p  pExample of the structure this is just part of one Fact tablep  pFact table  Propertyp  precodeFPROPERTY.PROPERTYID Key for table FPROPERTY.CYCLEFRAMETYPEID FPROPERTY.CYCLEGEARSNUMBERID FPROPERTY.CYCLEGEARSTYPEID FPROPERTY.CYCLEGENDERID FPROPERTY.CYCLEMUDGUARDSID FPROPERTY.CYCLEMUDGUARDSCOLOURID codepre  pDimension tables  p  precodeDCYCLEFRAMETYPES.CYCLEFRAMETYPEID DCYCLEFRAMETYPES.CYCLEFRAMETYPEDESC  DCYCLEGEARTYPES.CYCLEGEARTYPEID DCYCLEGEARTYPES.CYCLEGEARTYPEDESC  DCYCLEGEARTYPES.CYCLEGEARSNUMBERID DCYCLEGEARTYPES.CYCLEGEARSNUMBERDESC  DCYCLEGEARTYPES.CYCLEGENDERSID DCYCLEGEARTYPES.CYCLEGENDERSDESC  DCYCLEGEARTYPES.CYCLEMUDGUARDSID DCYCLEGEARTYPES.CYCLEMUDGUARDSDESC codepre  pSo rephrasing this  should the dimensions really be separate tables of the fact or would they be better with the description as part of the Fact I want reporting to be quick and simple and with minimal dropping of records where there is no values in fields. p

Negative 1763 pI want to visualize multiple large grayscale images in the browser using openlayers. I managed to do this using a zoomify tiling format and then serving the image tiles from a local server. The user should be able to view the different grayscale images at the same time. Each layer should be displayed in a different color, which should be changeable at will.p  pThe current approach I took was to colorize each grayscale image by multiplying it with a red image white appears red using ImageMagick, these colorized images are then served to the client. Currently I overlay multiple of these Images as separate openlayers layers and decrease their opacity while changing each of the images hue separately s.t. they appear in different colors i.e. shift red to blue, red to green. This is suboptimal since the images get very dark due to the fact that dark parts of each image darken the light parts of the other images.p  pMy questionsp  ol lipIs there a way to to tell openlayers or WebGLCanvas to interpret grayscale images either directly as separate RGB channels, so I dont have the whole opacity problem mentioned abovepli lipor, alternatively, is there a option to specify the blending mode of how layers are added. For example, in Photoshop there is an option to specify the layer blending mode i.e. linear dodge to add color channels of two different RGB images.pli ol

Negative 1763 pI have working more as a ASP.Net developer for over decades. Now I have been thrown a challenging projects and bit confused in finalizing the architecture.  As shown in the figure , we have a windows client which starts the UDP server to which clients listen. There are multiple location in which we need to replicate the same architecture. As you can see Network 1,2and nare location. All locations are under same corporate network. Now the challenge is to build a web app or windows app.p  ol liCan we build a ASP.Net web application which can start and stop the UDP server communication. My initial thoughts were to develop a web app and windows service. Make windows service and web application communicate through a databaselike if a particular bit in a table is true then window service will start the UDP broadcast. Windows service will be pooling this table continuously. li liWith windows app as broadcasting the UDPwe can exclude the need of windows service. But the problem is , if the system gets crashed or has any problem then we cannot use the application unless we substitute with new system and software. Customer does not like this option.li ol  pAny idea what you can think of .  Appreciate any design ideas.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comid4TT.png altenter image description herep
Negative 1763 pI have a 2D animation organized as a tree of shapes. However, I need a drawing order different than either a depthfirst or breadthfirst traversal from the root. Is there a way to control the final draw orderp  pI need to find a way to do this without breaking the parentchild inheritance in the tree. For instance, when I draw the tree, I need each child to inherit translations and rotations from its parent and then pass those translations and rotations on to their children.p  pI can think of various ways to handle this, but it does not seem like a unique problem so I am wondering if there is an OpenGLspecific solution.p

I have thousand of images like this, basically, a person and a somewhat whitish background.p  pWhat I have done is to use edge detector like canny edge detector or sobel filter from codeskimagecode library. Then what I think possible to do is, whiten the pixels within the edges and blacken the pixels without. Afterwards, the original image can be mask to get the picture of the person only.p  pHowever, its hard to get a closed boundary using canny edge detector.

Now it should copy the values to GPU. In order not to copy each time you specify a memory that should be used each time. But what if on each update I should change VBO, i.e. should again copy from CPU to GPU. What is the difference thenp

Negative 1763 pIm doing a program that will permit me to ping a lot of different IPs simultaneously around 5070.p  pI also need to delay the sending of each packet by say 1 ms, for multiple reasons, notably not getting my packets dropped by some routers which drop ICMP packets when theres too much sent at once which mine does, on the sending machine, not the receiving one.p  pSo I did it in a separate thread a bit like that p  precode Send thread for      [...]    for int i  0 i lt ipcount i            Send calls sendto       Sendmsocket, iparray[i]       [...]       Sleep1  Delay by 1 ms        [...]    lockuntilnewsendoperation  codepre  pAnd in another thread, thread I would like to receive the packets with select, like thatp  precode Receive thread FDZEROampmfdsetread FDSETmsocket, ampmfdsetread int rdscount  select0, ampmfdsetread, 0, 0, amptvtimeout if rdscount gt 0     ProcessReadySocket  Calls recv and stuff else       Timed out     mbSendGrapeDone  true  codepre  pThe problem with this approach is that since both calls to select and sento use the same nonblocking socket msocket, calls to sendto would later block because select makes sendto block when both are called simultaneously for some strange reason... dont see such logic there, since socket is non blocking, but it still does, its ugly.p  pSo I decided to use one socket exclusively for sending then and replaced the linep  precodeSendmsocket, iparray[i] codepre  pwithp  precodeSendmsendSock, iparray[i]  msendSock is dedicated to sending only codepre  pI read on MSDN that for raw sockets each socket receives all packets for the protocol the socket is set to mine is IPPROTOICMP ofc. Here I quote p  blockquote   pThere are further limitations for applications that use a socket of   type SOCKRAW. For example, all applications listening for a specific   protocol will receive all packets received for this protocolp blockquote  pSO I thought even though my packets are sent with msendSock, I could still receive them using selectrecv on msocket, turns out I cant, select never returns the socket is readable. So Im kind of stuck, I cannot use select and send at the same time. Is there something Im doing wrongp  pby the way I want to use raw sockets, not builtin windows icmp functionsp  pTLDR How can I send and select simultaneously Because on the send thread, send blocks as soon as select gets called on the receive thread, even if I used FIONBIO on it non blocking. If I use two different sockets, one for sending and one destined to receive, I receive nothing on the receiving socket... p  pThanksp

Negative 1763 pProbably what I am asking is impossible, but nevertheless here is my problem and question. First of all this is C and .NET.br I would like to define an empty implementation empty methods, functions returning defaults of a class to an interface in such a way if I change the interface I will not need to adapt the code. Unfortunately I can not generate the implementation containing assembly and I can not define a dynamical mock on it because instantiation is done automatically via reflection. Here is the problem explained more broadlybrp  pI have a dllassembly let us call it IMyInterface.dll that contains an interface IMyInterface.br Layers above I have the implementation in a separate dllassembly let us call it MyInterfaceImplementation.dll.br In the middlebetween I have an automatized test framework that can depend on IMyInterface.dll but not on MyInterfaceImplementation.dll.br Now this test framework uses the production code infrastructure that instantiates types via reflection. It is a dependency injection type framework. So you say to the production code infrastructure give me this interface implementation from this assembly.br In our case you say give me a IMyInterface from MyInterfaceImplementation.dll. In the test framework you can not depend from MyInterfaceImplementation so you define a fakestubmock class based on IMyInterface in a third assembly lets call it MyInterfaceFakeImplementation.dllbr In the test framework you say give me a IMyInterface from MyInterfaceFakeImplementation.dll and you are fine.br Note Do to our modules hierarchy it is not possible to restructure the dependencies. Regarding Mock Frameworks, I am not controlling the instantiation. Instantiation is done inside the dependency injection framework.p  pWhen you write your code in the MyInterfaceFakeImplementation.dll you write down like thisp  pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecodeclass MyInterfaceFakeImplementation  IMyInterface      IMyInterface implementation.   codepre  pNow what I would like is to provide is dynamic class of IMyInterface, so when interface changes than I do not need to adapt the fake.p  pVery shorty here is what I wantp  pGivenbr IMyInterface interface in IMyInterface.dllbr MyInterfaceFakeImplementation impementation of IMyInterface in MyInterfaceFakeImplementation.dllbr MyInterfaceFakeImplementation has empty functions and returns default values.p  pWhenbr I change IMyInterface Ex. change a functions signature.p  pThenbr I do not need to change MyInterfaceFakeImplementation, just recompile MyInterfaceFakeImplementation.dll. Note It is not possible to possible to generate this assembly, needs to be compiled.p  pHere is a workaround.br Do a fake implementation class next to IMyInterface in the IMyInterface.dll, let us call it MyInterfaceFakeBase. In the MyInterfaceFakeImplementation.dll derive the MyInterfaceFakeImplementation from this base class MyInterfaceFakeBase and leave it empty. When changing the interface IMyInterface adapt MyInterfaceFakeBase and never worry about MyInterfaceFakeImplementation and MyInterfaceFakeImplementation.dll.p  pOkie, for those who would like start coding here is a sample Console type App that, might help. Add a class to this code so that it finds a type that implements the interface and if you change the interface you do not need to change that class.

That codengifcode logic is driven by model changes, so what would be ideal is if there was some way to generate an afterAllModelChanges event so the above technique could be used irrespective of the specific codengifcode logic present.p  pIs there Or is there a better approach to solving this problemp

Negative 1763 pIve read a couple of similar questions on here but none have addressed, specifically, the problem Ive been having. As an idea this seems like it should be remarkably simple, in practice I have found it to be utterly impossible.p  pWhat I want to do is have a form, lets call it form A, create another form, lets call it form B, and wait for input on form B before continuing. So, youd have your main window, press a button and another window comes up prompting you for some value, the main window then waits for the input to be entered and processed and for the input window to close, then it uses that entered value to do something else.p  pI know this can be accomplished because JOptionPane does exactly that, but Im going to be using mostly numerical values and I dont want to go through the extra step of converting it. Also, it just seems like a good idea to know how to do something like this since it sounds so basic yet is proving quite difficult.p  pEdit It was suggested that this may be similar to some sort of modal something, but I read through that and it didnt even seem at all related to what Im asking.p  pEdit 2 There is a response with code that does exactly what I need, but whenever I attempt to modify it in almost any way, it ceases to function, this is what my class looks like, or at least this is the part that Im testing, the rest of it is mostly empty methods that arent being called yetp  precodepublic GatherGraphWindow parent, int type      superparent     parentWindowparent     this.infonew String[0]     constructTypetype  private void constructTypeint type      msgLabnew JLabel     iftypeTEXT              goText               private void goText      final JTextField jtf  new JTextField     JButton done  new JButtonDone      ifinfo.length0              setTitleTEXTT         msgLab.setTextTEXTM          else              ifinfo[0].length0                      setTitleTEXTT             msgLab.setTextinfo[1]                  else ifinfo[1].length0                      setTitleinfo[1]             msgLab.setTextTEXTM                  else                      setTitleinfo[0]             msgLab.setTextinfo[1]                   done.addActionListenernew ActionListener              Override public void actionPerformedActionEvent e                       parentWindow.setTextjtf.getText             Gather.this.dispose                    this.setLayoutnew GridLayout3,1     this.setSize250, 150      this.addmsgLab     this.addjtf     this.adddone      this.setVisibletrue  codepre

Negative 1763 pI am leaning about DDD so apologies if my question is naive. I think I need to use Local Data Transfer Object in order to display data to the users as a lot of properties are not part of any of Entity  Value Objects. p  pHowever, I am not sure where this DTO should be implemented  in a Domain Layer or in an Application Service Layer. The DTO implementation seems part of the Domain, but it means that when I create a collection of DTOs in the Service Layer and pass it to a Presentation Layer, I have to reference Domain Layer in  Presentation Layer, which seems wrong. p  pWhat is the correct way to implement DTO using DDD principlesp
Negative 1763 pI implemented Random Forest classifiers RF from Python scikitlearn package for a ML problem. In the first stage I used cross validation to spot check other algorithms and RF is now my choice. p  pLater on I also checked out what the OOB estimation of RF tells me. However, when I compare the return in oobscore with my results from CV I have a large discrepancy. p  pThe scikitlearn doc tells mep  blockquote   poobscore  bool p      pWhether to use outofbag samples to estimate the generalization error.p blockquote  pBecause of the doc I was assuming that the Parameter oobscore is the error estimation. But looking for reasons it also came to my mind that it might actually estimate the accuracy instead This would be  at least a bit  closer to my CV results. I checked also the code, and more believe its the accuracy but wanted to be sure... in this case I find the doc misleading BTW. p  pIs oobscore in scikitlearn accuracy or error estimationp  pThanks in advancep

The codeselectcode boxes show all values, but the first one, which is default, is blank. Changin the option selected also changes the variables on the controller.

Any ideasp  pEDIT I made some tests, and for some reason when I declare the ngmodels of the selectboxes inside a http request, these values arent set as default on the view. However, outside the http request it works.p

Negative 1763 pIf I have one table in SQL Database with two unique constraints, is there a specific order for the unique constraints to be checkedevaluated, and if there is any is there a way to configure the order precedence in which the constraints are evaluated.p  pEdit  I have a stored procedure that inserts records to DB table with two unique constraints A and B, the stored procedure checks which unique constraint was violated if any and performs a certain action accordingly. I dont know if this is valid at all for sql servers, but when I create constraint A before Constraint B, constraint A is evaluated before constraint B and vice versa. so is there any relation whatsoever between the order of creating the unique constraints and the order of checkingevaluating them. p

Negative 1763 pIm writing a directive that expands a DOM element to give it a full screen effect. Its not actually full screen but it enlarges to fill an entire section.p  pIts usage looks like sop  precodeltdiv idcontainergt     ...     ltdiv fullscreenanIdentifier fullscreentargetcontainergtltdivgt     ltbutton fullscreentriggeranIdentifiergt ltdivgt codepre  pThe codefullscreencode directive and the codefullscreentargetcode directive specify which element should fullscreen and into where. The codefullscreentriggercode directive adds a click event to trigger the full screen for a specific directive instance using an identifier, in this case anIdentifier broadcasting and event, which the codefullscreencode directive listens for.p  pRegarding speculative implementation, my codefullscreencode directive will add a placeholder in its place, detach itself from the DOM and add itself to the specified target, positioned to take up its full height and width. Simple enough.p  pMy question is regarding writing this directive for easy testing. What ways could I write this directive with testing in mind Here are some approaches Ive considered.p  p1 My first instinct was to write this DOM manipulation code in my directives controller. However, Ive read that DOM manipulation shouldnt happen in the controller.p  p2 I considered pulling it out in a service too but Ive read that services shouldnt manipulate DOM directly either. This has the added benefit of allowing me to mock the logic and ensure that my controller  directive attempts the DOM manipulations at the right times.p  pIn both the above cases I think testing would be quite easy. I can test both the controller and the service independently of the directive.p  p3 I could add this DOM manipulation code in my link function but I feel like that would make testing more difficult. Id need to create some HTML similar to above to test the directives entire use case. p  pIt feels as though I should pull this logic out in to something more easily testable, that exposes API to add a placeholder and move the element to a new parent, and the reverse.p  p4 Write a POJO object to encapsulate the logic, and require it using requireJS. Would this make testing the logic difficult I couldnt use DI to inject mock logic as in 2, and doesnt feel very angular.p  pIm relatively new to angular and Im struggling to settle on the right approach. Im looking for critiques  alternatives to my proposed design with regards to reusability and testing. Bonus points for tearing apart my original directive plan and suggesting an better alternative.p

Negative 1763 pIm currently reading Tanenbaums Modern Operating Systems and have a question about Gang or CoSchedulingp  pIts stated that an Operating Systems code is divided into logical parts by Mutexes to allow different parts of the OS to be executed simultaneously on different CPU cores e.g. the file system code can be run in parallel with the code handling interrupts. This means that the part of the OS which is responsible for the thread or process scheduling must be protected by a mutex.p  pAdditionally its stated that if two processes A and B are communicating heavily, the OS should use Gang or CoScheduling to let these two processes be run on different cores at the same time. This is a performance improvement because both processes might otherwise be blocked by waiting for the answer of the respective other process.p  pNow my questionsp  ol lipHow does an OS schedule a process or thread on a core on which its not currently running E.g. the scheduler runs on core X and therefore can only switch the context to another thread on core X and not CPUcore Y.pli lipHow is the OS able to schedule multiple cores at a time If the scheduler only runs on one core and is protected by a mutex to not run on multiple cores at a timepli ol

Negative 1763 pI need help to think about and implement filtering of codeNSFetchedResultsControllercodes codefetchedObjectscode strongat the model layerstrong.p  pDocs sayp  blockquote   h3Responding to Changesh3      pIn general, codeNSFetchedResultsControllercode is designed to respond to changes at the model layer, by informing its   delegate when result objects change location or when sections are   modified.p      pa hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosdocumentationCoreDataReferenceNSFetchedResultsControllerClassindex.html relnofollowNSFetchedResultsController Class Referenceap blockquote  pFor example, how could one implement search at the model layerp  pI imagine a codeFiltercode entity which is somehow related to the entities being filtered, and is used in the codeNSFetchRequestcodes predicate.p  pMaybe I would create a codeFiltercode object, configure it with, say, a string from a search field, and then save the object. This would affect the codeNSFetchRequestcodes predicate, so the codeNSFetchedResultsControllercode would get the private messages for updating its codefetchedObjectscode and issue messages to its delegate.p  pI could create other codeFiltercode objects or change existing ones which further affects the codeNSFetchedResultsControllercodes codefetchedObjectscode, and that, when deleted, stop affecting codefetchedObjectscode, which are then visible again.p  ul liWhat would the model look like in Xcodes model editorli liWhat would the codeNSFetchRequestcodes predicate look likeli liWhat are drawbacks with this approachli ul
Negative 1763 pIm using hadoop file checksum value for compare my files available in the hdfs location. I want to get an idea about what are the basic properties it will used to generate checksum value.p  pI have noticed it is considering file created time for checksum generation,  because it gave two different checksum values when i put the same file in two different times. p

Negative 1763 pIn my Rest API it should be possible to retrieve data which is inside a bounding box. Because the bounding box has four coordinates I want to design the GET requests in such way, that they accept the bounding box as JSON. Therefore I need to be able to send and document JSON strings as URL parameter.p  pThe test itself works, but I can not document these requests with Spring RestDocs 1.0.0.RC1.

Negative 1763 pIn C there are keywords that allow one to mark a parameter as a coderefcode, codeoutcode, or an ordinary parameter.p  pAre there any languages that support marking that a parameter being passed in wont be modified by that functionp  pIf the parameter were a list and the function called clear on the list, then in order for the language to know that the parameter wasnt changing, I guess such a language would also need a way of marking whether or not a method modified an objects internal state.p
