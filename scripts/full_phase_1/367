Positive 367 pI looked through some similar question but couldnt find an example of this sort of logic what im looking for is a way to parse through a large return of usernames in powershell. User names that are not service accounts or kiosks have a specific naming convention of 6 grouped numeric characters for example username123456. I was thinking there has to be a way of using the whereobject command but cant find anything on the syntax on technet or other PS resources. The one liner to get a return from the local domain isp  precodeSearchADAccount PasswordNeverExpires   SelectObject Name, Enabled codepre  pThis returns a list of domain accounts that have the password set to never expire. I want to only see the ones with the above naming convention  I know you can achieve this with regex but my regex is quite rustyif it can be done with whereobject that would be optimal. I also looked into using pattern, but it seems to be for more complex returns than this... Thanksp

Negative 367 pI would like to set up Apache 2 as a reverse proxy using namebased virtual hosts to decide how requests are routed to backend servers. Simple enough.p  pThe catch is that these backend servers may be added and removed in a dynamic fashion.

This does not seem like the correct solution. What is a better way to accomplish thisp  pI need to be able to gracefully transfer handling of names over to different backend servers. For instance, BackendServerA might be handling requests for example.com. A monitoring process might decide that BackendServerA is stale too much memory usage, theres new version of the server code to handle example.com, etc. The monitoring process starts BackendServerB which will soon handle requests for example.com. Apache should direct any new requests for example.com to BackendServerB, but allow any pending requests currently being handled by BackendServerA to complete before BackendServerA is shut down.p  pemUpdateem a hrefhttpserverfault.comquestions79390howtosetupanapache2reverseproxywithdynamicbackendserversPosted to Server Faultap

Negative 367 pIve been following a mostly DDD methodology for this project, so, like any DDDer, I created my domain model classes first. My intention is to use these POCOs as my LINQtoSQL entities yes, theyre not pure POCOs, but Im ok with that. Ive started creating the database schema and external mapping XML file, but Im running into some issues with modeling the entities relationships and associations.p  pAn artifact represents a document.

The only difference between the two classes, however, would be the presence of a Case field or a Task field. In the database of course, I would have a single table, Artifact, with a type discriminator field and the CaseId and TaskId fields.p  pMy question is this a valid approach to solving this problem, or would creating a join table for each association 2 new tables, total be a better approachp

Negative 367 pI am using linux kernel 2.6.30 on my board. It has 128MB of DDR2. My main application occupies almost 80MB of system memory. After executing all applications, only 25MB is left. I want to execute system commands from my main application which uses 80MB. But it is not executed. As per my understanding, each child process requires same memory as of parent processi got this description from fork function manual. So in my case, new child process requires another 80MB which is not available. Hence system call is not working. System command must execute immediately after giving command as followed steps in main application requires result of system command like need to store output of grep command in file and immediately read that file for further processing.

Negative 367 pI am a Python newbie coming from a C background. While I know its not Pythonic to try to find a matching concept using my old C knowledge, I think this question is still a general question to askp  pUnder C, there is a well known problem called globalstatic variable initialization order fiasco, due to Cs inability to decide which globalstatic variable would be initialized first across compilation units, thus a globalstatic variable depending on another one in different compilation units might be initialized earlier than its dependency counterparts, and when dependant started to use the services provided by the dependency object, we would have undefined behavior. Here I dont want to go too deep on how C solves this problem. p  pOn the Python world, I do see uses of global variables, even across different .py files, and one typycal usage case I saw was initialize one global object in one .py file, and on other .py files, the code just fearlessly start using the global object, assuming that it must have been initialized somewhere else, which under C is definitely unaccept by myself, due to the problem I specified above.p  pI am not sure if the above use case is common practice in Python Pythonic, and how does Python solve this kind of global variable initialization order problem in generalp  pThank you very muchp  pLinp

Negative 367 pI had a bug in our code signed java applet access denied java.net.SocketPermission x.x.x.x443 connectresolve. We had an html save button that was calling via javascript an applet method to save a file, loaded into the applet, onto the webserver. After some extensive google research, I fixed it by wrapping our applets save method code in doPrivileged. Bug seems to be fixed, people are happy.p  pI want to confirm that I completely understand the original circumstances and the solution I applied backwards, I know, but turn around time didnt allow me to really research the issue.p  pWhats specifically confusing me is that we tested our applet on a test server in our inhouse network extensively and never got this error until we attempted the javascript save button from a client machine external to our network. So at this point, Im just making an educated guess that is how the java applet sandbox mechanism works. p  pIs this true As long as the client applet is accessing web server resources from a client machine that is within the same domain network it is considered within the sandbox walls And if the client machine is external to the webservers local network the applet request is considered outside of the sandbox walls and needs the doPrivileged Or is there another explanation here that I am missingp  pI havent been able to find anything in suns documentation or through google that specifically proves or disproves my assertion. Clarification from someone with more experience in java applets is greatly appreciatedp

Negative 367 pstrongSummarystrong synchronisation of multiple SQLite databases with server side sequentially.p  pIm working on an Android application that is bound to be modular we have a launcher that fires off intents, based on user choice, to start different application modules separate installable packages. As it is now, each module has its own SQLite database and that works fine. The task Im assigned to requires making data synchronisation between handheld and server side SQL Server 2008 R2 using MS Sync Framework 4.0 currently October CTP. I had developed android lib according to Sync Framework specs and that works too. p  pThe issue I have is that because of this loosely coupled design and some other restrictions I need to have a button in launcher, that forces all modules to synchronise their databases onebyone order doesnt matter for now.p  pMy current approach is to have an abstract BroadcastReceiver amp Service I only now discovered IntentService classes that are inherited in each modules. So in launcher I broadcast intent, each module picks it up using customized BroadcastReceiver and syncs its database using, again, customized Service... In parallel. I have checked ordered broadcasts, but as I have a service doing the actual work it doesnt really help. The only other way I can currently think of is to have a systemwide mutex and use it to lock sync call in every service.p  pThis is my first Android related task so there probably is a better way to solve this, I wouldnt run from redesigning synchronisation part if that makes our teams future life a bit easier.p  p[strongEDITstrong] So it looks like Java doesnt support named mutexes.p  p[strongEDIT2strong] By modules or separate installable packages I meant different APK for each module. So when starting a module you actually start a new process for it.p

Negative 367 pIn a recent series of question I have asked alot about UDP, boostasio and c in general.p  pMy latest question, which doesnt seem to have an answer here at Stackoverflow, is thisp  pIn a clientserver application, it is quite okay to require that the server open a port in any firewall, so that messages are allowed in. However, doing the same for clients is definately not a great user experience.p  pTCPconnections typically achieve this due to the fact that most routers support stateful packet inspection, allowing response packets through if the original request originated from the local host.p  pIt is not quite clear to me how this would work with UDP, since UDP is stateless, and there is no such thing as response packets to my knowledge. How should I account for this in my client application p  pThanks for any answersp

Negative 367 pIm seeing a bizarre case where simple assignment to an instance variable is not working.  The right hand object is nonnil, but refuses to be assigned to an instance variable with the same type.

Negative 367 h2Problem Backgroundh2  pGenerating and accessing data of a fixed column layout is easy.  You can create local temp tables upfront, and populate them by calling stored procedures.p  pOn the other hand, if you want to generate data with a dynamic column layout, you must generally build an SQL statement dynamically and execute it with exec spexecutesql.  Since the data layout is unknown at runtime, you cannot create a temptable upfront, and once inside the exec spexecutesql statement, any temporary tables created there are bound to that scope and vanish when the call returns, so its much more difficult to access the data i.e. your options are more limited.p  h2My Specific Situationh2  pI have a query that needs to access data in a dynamically generated table.p  pThe table is generated by a stored procedure, which dynamically builds a query, stores it in a variable sql nvarcharmax, and runs it by calling  exec spexecutesql statement  sql.p  pThe sql statement was something like select  into temptable from..., but temptable was destroyed by the time exec spexecutesql returned.  A quick fix for this was to just use temptable instead i.e. a global temp table, because it survives when the stored procedure returns AND I can easily access it in the calling scope because it has a knownstatic name.p  pI dont like this solution because global temp tables arent threadsafe name collistionwise, and I dont want to have to mess with dynamicallygenerated unique names, because Ill just end up having to use more dynamic SQL to access them... which puts me right back at square one, leaving the data inaccessible outside the SP.p  pI dont think returning table variables through output parameters is an option new to SQL Server 2008 too, unless it can be done without having to define a static table type.  The tables my stored procedure generates are dynamic, and depend on the input parameters passed.p  pInline tablevalued functions are not an option, because Im running code loops to build the sql query and calling exec spexecutesql.p  pMultistatement tablevalued functions instead of the stored procedure, is also not an option, because such a function must have a welldefined table format, whereas Im running dyanmic SQL to return a table with a variable number of columns and column names depending on the input parameter values.p  pAll I really want to do is select the result set of the dynamic query into a new table, but Im finding it difficult, as none of the above works particularly irritating is how local temporary tables arent local to the session, but local to the stored procedure so that they vanish upon returning.  The only a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions653714howtoselectintotemptablefromstoredproceduresolutiona Ive seen insists that using OPENROWSET is the only way, but I dont want to mess with connection strings inside my stored procedure, for the same reason I dont want to include uniquenamemanagement code... its just way more complicated than it ought to be.p  pIn summary, I just want to execute dynamic SQL that generates a dataset of an unknown format, and be able to easily access it from the calling scope.p

TreeSet behaves like comapareTo0 means equals, not merely same size.p  pTo avoid this, comparison can secondarily look at something else if size is the same, but then it cannot be used to detect same sized different objects.p  pExamplep  precodeimport java.util.Comparator import java.util.HashSet import java.util.Objects import java.util.Set import java.util.TreeSet  public class Person implements ComparableltPersongt   private final String name private int height  public PersonString name,         int height      this.name  name     this.height  height   public int getHeight      return height   public void setHeightint height      this.height  height   public String getName      return name   Override public int compareToPerson o      return Integer.compareheight, o.height   public boolean equalsObject obj      if obj  null          return false          if getClass  obj.getClass          return false          final Person other  Person obj     if Objects.equalsthis.name, other.name          return false          return true   public int hashCode      int hash  5     hash  13  hash  Objects.hashCodethis.name     return hash   public String toString      return Person  name  , height    height     public static class PComparator1 implements ComparatorltPersongt       Override     public int comparePerson o1,             Person o2          return o1.compareToo2        public static class PComparator2 implements ComparatorltPersongt       Override     public int comparePerson o1,             Person o2          int r  Integer.compareo1.height, o2.height         return r  0  o1.name.compareToo2.name  r        public static void testSetltPersongt ps      ps.addnew PersonAnn, 150     ps.addnew PersonJane, 150     ps.addnew PersonJohn, 180     System.out.printlnps.getClass.getName     for Person p  ps          System.out.println   p        public static void mainString[] args      testnew HashSetltPersongt     testnew TreeSetltPersongt     testnew TreeSetltgtnew PComparator1     testnew TreeSetltgtnew PComparator2   codepre  presultp  precodejava.util.HashSet  PersonAnn, height  150  PersonJohn, height  180  PersonJane, height  150  java.util.TreeSet  PersonAnn, height  150  PersonJohn, height  180  java.util.TreeSet  PersonAnn, height  150  PersonJohn, height  180  java.util.TreeSet  PersonAnn, height  150  PersonJane, height  150  PersonJohn, height  180 codepre  pDo you have idea why it is sop

Negative 367 pIn most of the Activities and Places examples Ive seen, people use a SimplePanel as the display for an ActivityManager.p  pI was wondering if theres a benefit to using a DeckPanelDeckLayoutPanel instead of SimplePanel.  Its fairly trivial to create a wrapper around a Deck panel that implements AcceptsOnWidget.p  pI havent seen this topic discussed anywhere.  Prior to MVPActivities being commonly used in GWT, people generally used Tab panels which internally uses deck type panels and Deck panels to control switching between panels within a given view.p  pThe difference between the two is SimplePanel.setWidget.. will remove the previous child from the DOM and append the new widget whereas a deck type panel will use CSS to control visibility of the current panel i.e. display none to hide inactive panels.p  ol lipIf using a deck panel, it generally means you will have much more Elements in the DOM. I would imagine this uses more memory and makes the application sluggish, even if those nodes are not visible display none.  Is this truepli lipIf this is true, why did Google use a deck panel style impl for TabPanelTabLayoutPanel instead of internally using a SimplePanelpli lipIs one approach more favorable over the otherpli ol

Also to note is that the UserControl is added during runtime when the user doubleclicks on a ListboxItem.

Negative 367 pLets say i have a bunch of products. Each product has and id, price, and long description made up of multiple paragraphs. Each product would also have multiple sku numbers that would represent different sizes and colors.p  pTo clarify productid 1 has 3 skus, productid 2 has 5 skus. All of the skus in product 1 share the same price and description. product 2 has a different price and description than product 1. All of product 2s skus share product 2s price and description.p  pI could have a large table with different records for each sku. The records would have redundant fields like the long description and price.p  pOr I could have two tables. One named products with productid, price, and description. And one named skus with productid, sku, color, and size. I would then join the tables on the productid column.p  precodequery  SELECT  FROM skus LEFT OUTER JOIN products ON skus.productidproducts.productid WHERE colorgreen codepre  porp  precodequery  SELECT  FROM mastertable WHERE colorgreen codepre  pThis is a dumbed down version of my setup. In the end there will be a lot more columns and a lot of products. Which method would have better performancep  pSo to be more specific Lets say I want to LIKE search on the longdescription column for all of the skus. I am trying to compare having one table that has 5000 longdescription and 5000 skus vs OUTER JOINing two tables, one has 1000 longdescription records and the other has 5000 skus.p

The algorithm used in plugin described in this paper a hrefhttpbioinformatics.oxfordjournals.orgcontent25111463.full.pdf relnofollowhttpbioinformatics.oxfordjournals.orgcontent25111463.full.pdfa But i cant understand it. In real images, however,F1Q contains several peaks marking different translations with high correlation. Moreover, each peak describes eight different possible translations in 3D due to the periodicity of the Fourier space. To determine the correct shift, we select the n highest local maxima 333 neighborhood from F1Q and evaluate their eight possible translations by means of crosscorrelation on the overlapping area of the images A,B. The peak with the highest correlation is selected as translation between the two images. If none of the peaks is above a certain limit the tiles are assumed to be nonoverlapping. can anyone explain how to implement itp

Negative 367 pHeres my situation I have a codeUIViewControllercode that manages a hierarchy of subviews, perhaps as shown belowp  pimg srchttpi.imgur.comrJgL0.png altView hierarchyp  pThis view is built from a code.xibcode.  I would like to be able to maintain access to each subview of topView  that is, I want a pointer to each so that I can, for example, say something likep  precode[button1 setTextHello] codepre  pUsually, to do this, I wire up each element to which I would like access using Interface Builder, resulting in a header that looks something like thisp  precodeinterface MyViewController  UIViewController      weak IBOutlet UIView view     weak IBOutlet UILabel label     weak IBOutlet UIButton button1     weak IBOutlet UIButton button2   end codepre  pThese instance variables are codeweakcode, which is fine, since by the time my view controller gets them, theyre already owned by my view controllers root view which, confusingly, I labeled topView in my quick diagram.  In fact, I want these references to be weak  when my root view is released, so too should all its subviews be released.  Great.p  pBut lets say I want to create a new element of the UI, maybe a custom button, entirely in code.  Ill call this element codeCustomViewClasscode, which will be subclassed from codeUIViewcode.  The instance of codeCustomViewClasscode that I will create will be called codecustomButtoncode.  As with the other subviews of my view, I would like access to codecustomButtoncode so that I can interact with it.  I know, however, that like any other subview, codecustomButtoncode will be owned by its superview, and thats how it should be  again, I want it to be released whenever my view is released.  This makes me think that I should declare this view as a codeweakcode instance variable or property of my view controller.  Lets do thatp  precodeinterface MyViewController  UIViewController      weak IBOutlet UIView view     weak IBOutlet UILabel label     weak IBOutlet UIButton button1     weak IBOutlet UIButton button2     weak CustomViewClass customButton   end codepre  pThen, in my implementationp  precodeimplementation MyViewController  voidviewDidLoad      [super viewDidLoad]      customButton  [[CustomViewClass alloc] init]     [[self view] addSubviewcustomButton]  end codepre  pAs youve probably already realized, this wont work, and the compiler will throw a warning to boot.  Something likep  precodeAssigning retained object to weak variable object  will be released after assignment codepre  pI currently dodge this sort of warning with some very poor stylep  precodeimplementation MyViewController  voidviewDidLoad      [super viewDidLoad]      CustomViewClass customButtonLocal  [[CustomViewClass alloc] init]     [[self view] addSubviewcustomButtonLocal]     customButton  customButtonLocal  end codepre  pThat way, I get what I wantp  ol liAn instance of CustomViewClass on the screen...li li...with exactly one owner, its superview...li li...and no lingering variables customButtonLocal is released immediately after the block ends.li ol  pBut this cant be the right way to do this.  So, finally, my questionp  pstrongHow emshouldem I be allocating and instantiating this programmaticallycreated codeweakcode variable without using this middleman workaroundstrongp

Negative 367 pSo I have an odd little problem with the hashing function in PHP. It only happens some of the time, which is what is confusing me. Essentially, I have a Java app and a PHP page, both of which calculate the SHA256 of the same string. There hasnt been any issues across the two, as they calculate the same hash generally. The one exception is that every once in a while, PHPs output is one character longer than Javas.p  pI have this code in PHPp  precodetoken  GET[token] token  hashsha256, token.ltsaltgt echo Your token is  . token codepre  p99 of the time, I get the right hash.

But the top one computed by PHP has one more 0 for some reason. I havent really noticed a rhyme or reason to it, but its certainly stumped me. Ive tried thinking of things like the wrong encoding, or wrong return value, but none of them really explain why theyre almost identical except for that one character.p  pAny help on this issue would be much appreciated.p  pEDIT The space is only in the bottom one to highlight where the extra 0 is. The actual hash has no space, and is indeed a valid hash, as its the same one that Java produces.p  pEDIT2 Sorry about that. I checked the lengths with Notepad, and since its different than my normal text editor, I misread the length by 1. So yes, the top one is indeed right. Which means that its a bug in my Java code. Im going to explore Ignacios answer and get back to you.p

Negative 367 pDear stackoverflow users,p  pSome years ago i used mathematica for several months. After not programming for a few years I now do a research project, as a student, in which I use Matlab. I have found a lot of good help here on stackoverflow but now i am stuck at the following problemp  pI have a data set of connections between nodes on a rectangular grid, each node has a possible connection to its 8 neighbors. My measurements are in the form of a 3 by n matrix where the first two values designate a node and the third value designates whether or not they are connected, the size of the grid is predetermined. Typically there are about ten lines coming from two or three nodes which are neighboring at least one of each other. The goal of my research project is to calculate the area at distance r around this collection of lines.p  pSo far I have been able to plot the lines with the code below, for which I used bits of code from right here on stackoverflow, which was extremely useful. However I cant get a contour line around it at a certain distance with which I would hope to calculate the area inside this contour line. The gplot function returns two vectors with two coordinates per line which I find difficult to convert to something more useable. I tried defining a value Z at a distance from the lines, to decline with distance from the lines, so I get a slope coming from these lines. From this slope i could calculate contourlines. However, because the lines are just coordinates I dont know how to calculate the distance to that line, opposed to when they would have been functions.p  pI am really at a loss. I hope I have somewhat clearly posted my problem here. This is the second time I post this problem, I have now added comments to the code and pictures to explain myself better. Thanks for any advice givenp  pThis I have so far, the xls file is the 3 by n matrix i mention above, I have also written its contents in matrix form in the code below so my problem is easier to understandp  precode here i set my dataconstants  filenamerandom.xls filexlsreadfilename ywidth xlength    random.xls looks approximately like this, after xlsreadfilename you get  file[21    22  1 21  20  1 15  16  1 15  14  1 15  23  1 14  22  1 14  21  1 22  15  1 23  14  1 24  15  1 6   15  1 5   14  1 7   14  1 8   15  1]   predefined width and length, i usually get this from the file  width8 length4   here i create my adjaceny matrix in a elegant way user amro posted on stackoverflow  however i immediately multiply it by 0, creating a yx by yx matrix with all zeroes  [X Y]  meshgrid1x,1y X  X Y  Y  adjacency  squareform pdist[X Y], chebychev  1  adjacencyadjacency0   here i take the matrix file for which the first two values are node numbers and   the third value designates whether there is a connection between the two nodes to  fill in the connections in the adjacencymatrix  [nrows,ncols]sizefile for r  1nrows       if filer,31          adjacencyfiler,1,filer,21       end end adjacencyadjacencyadjacency.   plots the adjacencymatrix  subplot121, spyadjacency   plots the connections and designates the nodes, note that the numbers designating  the nodes do not match original data, this is a separate problem i have not solved  [xx yy]  gplotadjacency, [X Y] subplot122, plotxx, yy, ks, MarkerFaceColor,b   these last lines of code for plotting the numbers of the grid i do not fully  understand, in here is the cause for the numbers not matching the original data  axis[0 x1 0 y1] [X Y]  meshgrid1x,1y X  reshapeX,[],1  0.1 Y  reshapeY,[],1  0.1 textX, Yend11, cellstrnum2str1xy  xlabellength ylabelwidth titlefilename codepre  pto clarify my problem i added these two pictures current plot a hrefhttpimgur.com5uPd4 relnofollowhttpimgur.com5uPd4a area i want to know a hrefhttpimgur.comWsIbg relnofollowhttpimgur.comWsIbgap

Negative 367 pIm trying to implement WCF into MonoDroid. I think theres no big difference between it and MonoTouch on this issue. And after researching, I counldnt find the supoort for anyother WCF binding mode except BasicHttpBinding.p  pHonestly Im not good that WCF at all, so I just tried ways randomly. I can get messages from server with string and byte[] and so on, but when i wanted to upload large data eg. image or audio, the uploaded message which includes big byte[] must be limited under 8192bytes. That causes my uploading into failure.p  pNow what I can do is to convert the big byte[] into Base64String and split it into 8000bytes pieces, and execute a bunch of commands like UploadAsynorderNumber, uploadStringBlock, and reform them up again in server with the orderNumber. and convert back to bytes from Base64string. Very busy and sillyp  pOtherwise I must think other way to solve large file uploading from mobile phone.p  pAnd its really a big pity and problem not to make all actions achieved totally inside WCF coding.p  pHope Mono improve it. and if any help welcome and appreciated.p

I dont want that overhead, and I think its already being taken care of by the framework via Validation.Errors.p  pMy UI looks something like thisp  precodeltListBox ItemSourceBinding ElementNameActivityCodesGrid, PathValidation.Errors gt ltigDPXamDataGrid NameActivityCodesGrid  DataSourceBinding ActivityCodes gt codepre  pYou see, I want to bind the Validation.Errors property to something that will display them, but Im having trouble either binding to them correctly or getting updated versions of it.  strongIs this possible to bind directly to Validation.Errors like thisstrongp  pstrongEDIT 1strongp  pBlast  Once I posted this question, I found thisp  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1615631listingallvalidationerrorsinasinglewpfcontrolrq1Listing all Validation.Errors in a single WPF controlap  pIt seems Validation.Errors is misleading by being an array.  Im going to try the solution listed in the second answer.  If you have something different than the linked answers offer, please sharep

Negative 367 pWebapplications experienced a great paradigm shift over the last years.p  pA decade ago and unfortunately even nowadays, webapplications lived only in emheavyweightedem servers, processing everything from data to presentation formats and sending to dumb clients which only rendered the output of the server browsers.p  pThen AJAX joined the game and webapplications started to turn into something that lived between the server and the browser.p  pDuring the climax of AJAX, the webapplication logic started to live entirely on the browser. I think this was when HTTP RESTful APIs started to emerge. Suddenly every new service had its strongemkindofemstrong RESTful API, and suddenly JavaScript MV frameworks started popping like popcorns.

Parametrs would be filled continuously in octet string. For example, suppose the first parameter is 1 bit long so it would be filled at 0th bit position of 1st octet of the octet string. Now the second parameter is suppose 9 bit long. So the first 7 bits of this parametr would be filled in the same octet and the next 2 bits should go to 0th and 1st bit position of next octet. Similarly other parameters would get filled in the octet string.

Ive seen similar things on other ARMv7 devices, though see below, so I suppose any solution will require a more general look at the behaviour of mutexes and memory fences for ARMv7.p  pPseudo code for the scenariop  pstrongThread 1  Producing Datastrongp  precodevoid ProduceFunction    MutexLock   int TempProducerIndex  mSharedProducerIndex  Take a copy of the int member variable for Producers Index   mSharedArray[TempProducerIndex]  NewData  Copy new Data into array at Temp Index    mSharedProducerIndex  TempProducerIndex  Signal consumer data is ready by assigning new Producer Index to shared variable   MutexUnlock  codepre  pstrongThread 2  Consuming Datastrongp  precodevoid ConsumingFunction     while mConsumerIndex  mSharedProducerIndex      doWorkOnData mSharedArray[mConsumerIndex]     codepre  pPreviously when the problem cropped up on iPad 2, I believed that codemSharedProducerIndex  TempProducerIndexcode was not being performed atomically, and hence changed to use an codeAtomicCompareAndSwapcode to assign codemSharedProducerIndexcode. This has worked up until this point, but it turns out I was wrong and the bug has come back. I guess the fix just changed some timing.p  pI have now come to the conclusion that the actual problem is an out of order execution of the writes within the mutex lock, i.e. if either the compiler or the hardware decided to reorderp  precodemSharedArray[TempProducerIndex]  NewData  Copy new Data into array at Temp Index  mSharedProducerIndex  TempProducerIndex   Signal consumer data is ready by assigning new Producer Index to shared variable codepre  p... top  precodemSharedProducerIndex  TempProducerIndex  Signal consumer data is ready by assigning new Producer Index to shared variable mSharedArray[TempProducerIndex]  NewData  Copy new Data into array at Temp Index  codepre  p... and then the consumer interleaved the producer, the data would not have yet been written when the consumer tried to read it.p  pAfter some reading on memory barriers, I therefore thought Id try moving the signal to the consumer outside the codemutexunlockcode, believing that the unlock would produce a memory barrierfence which would ensure codemSharedArraycode had been written top  precodemSharedArray[TempProducerIndex]  NewData   Copy new Data into array at Temp Index  MutexUnlock mSharedProducerIndex  TempProducerIndex  Signal consumer data is ready by assigning new Producer Index to shared variable codepre  pThis, however, still fails, and leads me to question if a codemutexunlockcode will definitely act as a write fence or notp  pIve also read a hrefhttpwww.hpl.hp.compersonalHansBoehmmiscslidesreordering.pdf relnofollowan article from HPa which suggested that compilers could move code into but not out of codecritseccodes. So even after the above change, the write of codemSharedProducerIndexcode could be before the barrier. Is there any mileage to this theoryp  pBy adding an explicit fence the problem goes awayp  precodemSharedArray[TempProducerIndex]  NewData  Copy new Data into array at Temp Index  OSMemoryBarrier mSharedProducerIndex  TempProducerIndex  Signal consumer data is ready by assigning new Producer Index to shared variable codepre  pI therefore think I understand the problem, and that a fence is required, but any insight into the behaviour of the unlock and why it doesnt appear to be performing a barrier would be really useful.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pRegarding the lack of a mutex in the consumer thread Im relying on the write of the codeint mSharedProducerIndexcode being a single instruction and therefore hoping the consumer would read either the new or old value. Either are valid states, and providing that codemSharedArraycode is written in sequence i.e. prior to writing codemSharedProducerIndexcode this would be OK, but from what has been said so far, I cant reply on this.p  pBy the same logic it appears that the current barrier solution is also flawed, as the codemSharedProducerIndexcode write could be moved inside the barrier and could therefore potentially be incorrectly reordered.p  pIs it recommended to add a mutex to the consumer, just to act as a read barrier, or is there a codepragmacode or instruction for disabling outoforder execution on the producer, like a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiEnforceInOrderExecutionofIO relnofollowcodeEIEIOcodea on PPCp

Negative 367 pIm reading the book Programming Entity Framework DbContext, by Julia Lerman and Rowan Miller.p  pIve downloaded the BAGA solution from a hrefhttpwww.thedatafarm.comlearnentityframeworkdownloadfilesdbcontextStartingSolution.zip relnofollowhttpwww.thedatafarm.comlearnentityframeworkdownloadfilesdbcontextStartingSolution.zipa.  I feel like a complete tool here because I cant get any of the code samples to run on my computer.p  pNormally, when I work with Entity Framework, I have a connection string in my configuration that tells Entity Framework what database to connect to and what credentials to use.p  pHowever, in this BAGA solution, I cannot find a connection string or a reference to a database anywhere in the solution.  Im guessing that the code is supposed to all run locally or somesuch, but when I type in and run any of the sample queries or updates, the computer pauses for about 20 seconds and then the following exception is thrown form the codeSaveChangescode method The provider did not return a ProviderManifestToken string.p  pIm guessing that this solution is supposed to either use an internal database, or Im supposed to type a connection string somewhere, but I dont see where in the book it tells me how to make this solution work.p  pIt does clearly state that the solution uses EF Code First.p  pThe console app code in BAGA looks like thisp  precodeusing System using System.Collections.Generic using System.Data.Entity using System.Data.Entity.Infrastructure using System.Linq using System.Text using DataAccess using Model  namespace BreakAwayConsole    class Program        static void Mainstring[] args            Database.SetInitializernew InitializeBagaDatabaseWithSeedData         Call the latest example method here         NOTE Some examples will change data in the database.

Negative 367 pIm working on an Android app that will be uploading and downloading data from a MYSQL database from many locations. My understanding is that IP addresses will be created dynamically and the server will have to communicate data with different IPs every day for the application to be used anywhere.p  pMy database is currently being hosted with Tsohost.com, I am able to communicate with the database, however, each IP has to be manually authorised a hrefhttpi.imgur.comdLVBQoX.png relnofollowhttpi.imgur.comdLVBQoX.pnga. How can I get around this problem Is this problem unique to Tsohost, or do I need to create some kind of interface.

Negative 367 pI have a BSpline curve. I have all the knots, and the x,y coordinates of the Control Points.p  pI need to convert the BSpline curve into Bezier curves.p  pMy end goal is to be able to draw the shape on an html5 canvas element. The BSpline is coming from a dxf file which doesnt support Beziers, while a canvas only supports Beziers.p  pIve found several articles which attempt to explain the process, however they are quite a bit over my head and really seem to be very theory intensive. I really need an example or step by step help.p  pHeres what Ive found a hrefhttpswww.cs.drexel.edudavidClassesCS430LecturesL09BSplinesNURBS.pdf relnofollowExplains BSplinesa,a hrefhttpwww.infogoaround.orgJBookbstobez.html relnofollowConverting to Beziersa,a hrefhttpwww.maissan.netarticlessimulatingvines2 relnofollowJavascript Exampleap  pThe last link is nice because it contains actual code, however it doesnt seem to take into account the weight assigned by the nodes. I think this is kind of important as it seems to influence whether the curve passes through a control point.p  pI can share my Nodes or Control Points if that would be useful. If someone would point me to a stepbystep procedure or help me with some psuedoor actualcode, I would be so grateful.p

Negative 367 pIn a Swing Gui, every component refers, by design, to its own data model to display data. Although they dont refer to a common model, sometimes components can  be dependent to each other, because of the semantic of the program. p  pFor example if the Gui has a JToggleButton that showshides a table and another JButton,  whose actionListener counts the rows in that table, the latter must be disabled when the former is not selected and the table not visible. Indeed  lets suppose counting the rows of a non visible table might lead to an inconsistent state. Say, for example, that when the table is hidden the JButtons actionListener calls a method on a variable that is set to null.p  pI know this is a very trivial example. But it has happened to me, quite often, that I had to kind of look at all these dependencies between components. And I had to disable some components, so as to prevent the user from bringing the program to an inconsistent state, by clicking on the wrong button at the wrong time. p  pTherefore, I have started wondering if there is a more organized and standard way to address this problem, than just skimming trough the code and place some setEnablefalse, here and there, where I notice there is a dependency.p  pA way to go, I think, could be to have a dependency matrix of boolean values one row for each possible state of the interface, and one column for each component of the interface. emmatrix[i][j]em would be emtrueem if at state emiem, the component emjem must be disabled. and emfalseem otherwise. p  pWhat to you think about it  Is there any kind of design pattern to address this problem  p  pcheersp

Negative 367 pI have written an html5 web application and when running on Android 4.0.4, I have noticed the following issue I have two consecutive input fields on a form, one is a text field and the next is a date field. If the focus is currently in the text field and the virtual keyboard is displayed and the tab button is pressed on the virtual keyboard, the focus moves to the date field, however the date picker dialog box is NOT displayed for the date field. This issue is happening in both the standard Android browser and Chrome, as followsp  pUsing the standard android browser, when tabbing from text to date, the keyboard stays displayed, even though the field being entered is a date field and the date picker dialog box should now be displayed.p  pUsing Chrome, when tabbing from text to date, the keyboard disappears but the date picker dialog box is not displayed.p  pEither way, this is unacceptable.  When the focus moves to a date field via the tab key, the date picker dialog box should be displayed exactly the same way that the date picker dialog box is displayed when the user touches the input typedate box.p  pThis is without doubt yet another bug in the Android 4.0.4 OS, which I am realizing is full of such bugs. My question is this  Is there anything programmatically I can do to workaround this to make the date picker dialog box appear when the date field is tabbed to using the virtual keyboardp

I just need some directions on what classestechniquessolutions to use specifically in libgdx. p  pSo I need to take pixels from the blue texture and draw them above the green one. Is there a way to do this with a shader or maybe by directly taking pixel values from blue tiles texturep  pSay I already have all my textures with no transition sprites yet calculated loaded in a codeTextureAtlascode. What classes should go next to get the desired effectp  pstrongUpdatestrong Here is a rough example of what my code currently is. My gameScreen.render method looks simply like thisp  precodebatch.begin for int x  0 x lt width x          for int y  0 y lt height y                  Sprite sprite  getFloorSpriteByCellcells[x][y]                 batch.drawsprite, x  32, y  32           batch.end codepre  pand in codegetFloorSpriteByCellcode I choose between some of preloaded sprites, thats all, no fancy level editing in a fancy guithing.p  pI dont use tilemaps, I just need to draw some part of a texture above another texture during rendering.p

Negative 367 pI have a project that I am currently updating, in previous versions i have been able to select the title text and it would react as part of the back button in the action bar. I currently have no icon in the actionbar by design and in previous versions the text was still interactive. p  pI tried implementing different layouts for varying screen sizes however since then on normal and small screen tested s3 Mini and Sony xperia Tipo sized phones now only the back button lt reacts to touch. The title text is still clickable on an S4 and a nexus 4. I have reverted the code back to how it was before I made those changes, along with trying code from last week to make sure nothing has changed and the bug still occurs. I have tried other apps on the s3 mini and the text in RedReader is clickable so its definitely app side but not sure what has changed will cause this.p  pI am currently at a loss as to why it is doing it. Ive also attempted to update ActionBarSherlock to see if that may have caused an issue but not sure what to try nextp

The two options I see are LONGTEXT or BLOB. I can see some advantages for both. From what I have researched both will have a maximum length of 4GB  1B. BLOBS are not searchable but store the data passed to them byte for byte which may or may not be advantageous  I am not sure. LONGTEXT is searchable and if I can change the encoding from UTF8 to something closer to BASE64 if you know what encoding would be best, let me know then it might be more space efficient than the BLOB encoding which at the moment is encoded as UTF8 and reversible via codeCONVERTvalue USING utf8code.p  pAnother option I saw was storing both by having a coderawValuecode which just uses the code.toStringcode method on whatever is being stored and codevaluecode which is a BLOB or even LONGTEXT if appropriate. This would provide searchable data in the coderawValuecode and an object representation in the codevaluecode. I am not sure if this would be something beneficial to do in the long run, but it would make it easier for thirdparties to access the database and to read the data from other languages such as PHP.p  pI am willing to take on suggestions for completely different approaches if you feel you have something better for this scenario.p

Negative 367 pI am new both to NetLogo NL and Stackoverflow. I am working on NL model of opinion formation and I am stuck with following problem googling or anything else didnt work for me. p  pFirst, turtleown property codeturtlesown [opinion]code is defined. Next, there is a random normal distribution of opinion variable ranges from 1 to 1. I want to be able to account for different shapes of opinion distribution in range from 1 to 1. This is done by using coderandomnormalcode command with two inputs mean set to 0 and std. dev. set by slider i.e. the shape is given by the std. dev. value.p  pHere is a code of setup functionp  precodeto setup clearall randomseed seed crt number ask turtles [set opinion randomnormal 0 std.dev.] ... defining other turtles properties end codepre  pNevertheless, setting std.dev. slider to 1 does not produce expected outcome bellshaped distribution, but rather uniform distribution. I am not sure whether this is a conceptual or technical problem. p  pAny help is much appreciated. p

Negative 367 pNote I found a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions16651909jointablesbasedonlaggeddatethis similar questiona but it does not address my issue, so I do not believe this is a duplicate.p  pI have two simple MySQL tables created with the MyISAM engine, codeTable1code and codeTable2code.p  pBoth of the tables have 3 columns, a datetype column, an integer ID column, and a float value column. Both tables have about 3 million records and are very straightforward.p  pThe contents of the tables looks like this with codeDatecode and codeIdcode as primary keysp  precodeDate        Id   Var1 2012127    1    0.1 2012127    2    0.5 2012228    1    0.6 2012228    2    0.7 codepre  passume codeVar1code becomes codeVar2code for the second table.p  pNote that for each year, month, ID triplet, there will only be a single entry. But the actual day of the month that appears is not necessarily the final day, nor is it the final weekday, nor is it the final business day, etc... Its just some day of the month. This day is important as an observation day in other tables, but the dayofmonth itself doesnt matter between codeTable1code and codeTable2code.p  pBecause of this, I cannot rely on codeDate  INTERVAL 1 MONTHcode to produce the matching dayofmonth for the date it should match to that is one month ahead.p  pIm looking to join the two tables on codeDatecode and codeIdcode but where the values from the second table codeVar2code come from 1month ahead than codeVar1code.p  pThis sort of code will accomplish it, but I am noticing a significant performance degradation with this, explained below.p  precode This is exceptionally slow for me SELECT b.Date,         b.Id,         a.Var1,         b.Var2 FROM Table1 a JOIN Table2 b ON a.Id  b.Id AND YEARa.Date  INTERVAL 1 MONTH  YEARb.Date AND MONTHa.Date  INTERVAL 1 MONTH  MONTHb.Date    This returns quickly, but if I use it as a subquery  then the parent query is very slow. SELECT Date  INTERVAL 1 MONTH as FutureDate,        Id,        Var1 FROM Table1    That is, the above is fast, but this is super slow select b.Date,         b.Id,         a.Var1,         b.Var2 FROM SELECT Date  INTERVAL 1 MONTH as FutureDate              Id,              Var1       FROM Table1 a JOIN Table2 b ON YEARa.FutureDate  YEARb.Date AND MONTHa.FutureDate  MONTHb.Date AND a.Id  b.Id codepre  pIve tried reordering the codeJOINcode criteria, thinking maybe that matching on codeIdcode first in the code would change the query execution plan, but it seems to make no difference.p  pWhen I say super slow, I mean that option 1 from the code above doesnt return the results for all 3 million records even if I wait for over an hour. Option 2 returns in less than 10 minutes, but then option number three takes longer than 1 hour again.p  pI dont understand why the introduction of the date lag makes it take so long.p  pHow can Ip  ol liprofile the queries to understand why it takes a long timeli liwrite a better query for joining tables based on a 1month date lag where dayofmonth that results from the 1month lag may cause mismatches.li ol

Negative 367 pI am using Android shared prefs for saving user settings.  The problem is that it creates java objects every time you commit values.  A compromise is to only commit the changes everysooften which works, but still generates garbage and may lose settings if the application ends soon after a change.p  pIs there a way to save prefs often and prevent garbage generation or a usable alternative.  One could imagine allocating a fixed number of characters in sharedpref storage and updating it without creating strings but that would take a lot of effort to develop ie converting floats, booleans and integers into characters without creating objects.  Besides, reimplementing framework code seems like a bad idea.p

Negative 367 pWere dealing with C code on a Unix system at school, and we want to fork processes to split the application into several processes.  Looking for conceptual help with the nitty gritty of how forks work.p  pFor example, I understand that when you fork, a new [child] process is created with an identical memory space to the parent process shared memory aside.  In this context, what is the parent process though  How much of the code base is packed into a given process before the OS breaks the application apart into smaller processes  Or am I thinking of processes all wrongp  pExample, if you have a 100,000 line program that has a fork call somewhere on the 70,000th line, is the entire program and memory that has been built up over the runtime of the application duplicated even if only a small bit of the parents data is necessary for the childs success  Is a large program like this split up into smaller processes to mitigate the duplication load of a fork call  If so, where are the splits  If not, how can you optimize around this  Should applications not be this large to begin withp  pA similar question, when a child process is created that is identical to the parent, when can it be assumed to be terminated  Using the above example of a 100,000 line program, if there is a fork at line 100, will the forked child run the entirety of the rest of the program even if that is not needed  How can you avoid this  Are there design factors that our class isnt delving into  We are living in an academic codebase where all our programs are 50 lines or less but Im trying to learn bigpicture concepts for my edification.p  pThanksp

Negative 367 pI have a function working in java such that HashMap has a store of key as String and value as ArrayList. So my quetion is when different user login at the same time and they try to access the webapplication and will selecet the same key , than in that case hashmap need to be synchronized p  plike ..When User1 will login the vlaue in hashmap will store behind the scene such as  map.putA, List1 map.putB, List2p  pWhen User2 will login the vlaue in hashmap will store behind the scene such as  map.putA, List3 map.putC, List4p  pso now if both user will login at the same time and key is same but List values are always different  than this hashmap need to be synchronized .p

Negative 367 pI use Google Chrome with Intern to run automated tests and I would like to know if there is a way to launch Chrome in emulation mode from CLI or using a specific flag to test mobile rendering. If not, do you know a good workaround p  pI could directly use the Android Emulator from Android SDK with Selenium Webdriver apk or with mobile Chrome but tests are crashing most of the time, emulators dont respond and I have to restart it. Also, I need to test on the largest possible scope, not limited to Android devices. Chrome on desktop is a lot more stable and even if a test fails, chrome always respond and can be closed automatically by Intern.p  pI tried a workaround with the enabletouchevents flag and with a custom userAgent but its producing weird behaviors. Maybe some other flags would help me p  pThank you in advance for your answer. p

Negative 367 pI have written 2 android apps.  One is a keyboard, the other is a typing speed measurer.p  pI would like to broadcast a tick to any other apps that are listening or to nobody at all, if none are listening, whenever a key in the keyboard app is released.  I dont want this broadcast to launch the other app if it is not running, but if it is awake and in the foreground, I want the second app to be able to count these ticks to determine how many keys have been pressed in the first app independent of their text output.p  pI thought broadcasting an Intent would be a good way to accomplish this, but it appears that that will launch the second app.p  pA SharedPreference would also work, but that doesnt seem like the correct tool for the job.p  pAny better suggestionsp

Negative 367 pstrongSymptomsstrongbr When I open a certain WPF solution in Visual Studio 2010, after the solution loads and is displayed in Solution Explorer, for a moment, I see the source control icons locks, checkout checks, etc next to the items in the solution and then they disappear, except for check marks for checked out files. Right clicking any of the items without an icon shows a context menu without any of the source control actions. The checked items can be checked in and then the source control actions disappear for them too. If I open the Change Source Control dialog, the solution and all of the projects have the red line under them indicating they are invalid. I can unbind each of them, then rebind them to the exact same Server Name and Server Binding successfully. This causes solution explorer to temporarily become source controlenabled again. But if I click the refresh button on solution explorer, I get a dialog stating, An error occurred while accessing the source control system. Do you want to disable source control for this session. which causes the solution explorer to lose source control interoperability again. p  pYesterday, I tried to download the latest of a different solution that I had update on another machine. I found that somehow the new files I had added to the solution on the other machine were not in TFS. So I excluded them from the project and reincluded them to add them to TFS. Then on my machine did Get Latest again. The solution updated so it knew the files should be included but it didnt download the files themselves. I tired Get Latest with Replace files even if the local version matches the server version and they still didnt download. I had to specifically get each file from Source Control Explorer. This may be unrelated but I wanted to include it in case its not.p  pstrongWhat Ive Triedstrongbr To try to solve the 1st problem, I reset all VS settings. Restarted. Didnt work so I shut it down. Uninstalled TFS Power Tools. Didnt work. Replaced my .sln and .vssscc with the latest from TFS. Unselected TFS as the source control plugin and reselected it. Uninstalled the NuGet Package Manager extensions. No help. I dont have any addins and the only extensions I have installed now are a few Telerik control extensions, which are not new.p  pWhy are the source control bindings becoming invalidp

Negative 367 phow to do a view controller transition where the selected view stays in place and fades outp  pI am interested in doing a transition where it is a standard push transition but that the fromViewController  will  persist the selected UIView over the top of the toViewController while the toViewController slides into place.

In the middle figure, the fromViewController slides to the left eve as the toViewController slides in. The selected UIView stays in place and has an animation that fades it out. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comFU3VL.png altenter image description herep  pI am not so familiar with Custom Transitions but am thinking this is how it woudl be done.

Negative 367 pi am trying to use Googles Text to speech engine for Hindi language in android. When i pass Hindi text in TextToSpeechs speak method, it used to play the audio using the Networktts. This used to work fine before an update to Google Text to speech app which got published on 27th May 2014. After that it has stopped working. When i examined the logcat entries i found that earlier it used to connect to p  precodeIGoogleTTSService12454 Creating Google TTS service, version 2.4.3.1227136 codepre  pand returned language code 0. Hindi TTS would work fine. While now it connect top  precodeIGoogleTTSService11289 Creating Google TTS service, version 3.1.3.1162895 codepre  pand it returns language code 2. Now it doesnt work.p  pIf i uninstall the updates of Google Text to speech app then it rollbacks to version 2.4.3.1227136 and Hindi Text to speech works again. p  pAny idea how can i work with Hindi using the latest version of Google Text to speechp  pThanksp

Negative 367 pDo deadlocks put processes into a high rate of CPU usage, or do these two processes both sleep, waiting on the other to finish  p  pI am trying to debug a multithreaded program written in C on a Linux system.  I have noticed excessive CPU utilization from one particular process, and am wondering if it could be due to a deadlock issue.  I have identified that one process consistently uses more of the CPU than I would anticipate using top, and the process works, but it works slowly.  If deadlocks cause the processes to sleep and do not cause high CPU usage, then at least I know this is not a deadlocking issue.p

Most of the time gets lost due to constructor calls vs simple memcopy.p  pSo my question is Is there a way to implement this interface or an alternative with good bulk insertread performancep  hr  pEdit This is the current implementation Im usingp  precodeclass LWDynamicVector  private   typedef stdvectorltPocoDynamicAnygt DataList      DataList mdata public   LWDynamicVector     templatelttypename Tgt stdvectorltTgt read      return stdvectorltTgtmdata.begin,mdata.end       templatelttypename Tgt void writeAppendstdvectorltTgt v      mdata.insertmdata.end,v.begin,v.end         templatelttypename Tgt void writeReplacestdvectorltTgt v      mdata.assignv.begin,v.end     codepre  pAnd the Test I am usingp  precodeTESTDynamicVector,Performance    typedef double Type   sizet runs  100 sizet N  20480   stdvectorltTypegt input   input.reserveN   forsizet i  0 i lt N i      input.pushbackrand            OldVectorltTypegt instance     PocoTimestamp ts     forsizet i  0 i lt runs i        instance.writeAppendinput          stdcout ltlt Old vector time elapsedms   ltlt ts.elapsed  1000.0 ltlt stdendl      stdvectorltTypegt output  instance.read     EXPECTEQoutput.back,output.back            LWDynamicVector dbv     PocoTimestamp ts     forsizet i  0 i lt runs i        dbv.writeAppendinput          stdcout ltlt New vector time elapsedms   ltlt ts.elapsed  1000.0 ltlt stdendl      stdvectorltTypegt output  dbv.readltTypegt     EXPECTEQoutput.back,output.back      codepre  pWhich results inp  precodeOld vector time elapsedms  44.004 New vector time elapsedms  4380.44 codepre  pRegarding compiler options and optimizations Unfortunately Im stuck at the current settings without the option to change them.

Negative 367 pI got a Mac Air from friend and the Mac OS is 10.7Lion. I try to delete friends data but unfortunately I deleted the whole disk and now there is no Mac OS in this Air. There is always only a folder with question mark in a white background after starting up this Air. My question is how to install any Mac OS to this Air nowp  pI try to Restore to the manufacture and go to page Reinstall Mac OS X. I enter my Apple ID and password and it only shows OS Lion for download. But when I click download, it says this OS is temporarily unavailable in AppStore. It seems I have to download and install Mavericks its free. But I need a proper Apple ID  the one that has been used with the computer to install App Store software, which should be my friends Apple ID. May I use my Apple ID to install Mavericks to this Air Is there any other way to install Mavericks or Lion to this Air Thanks. p

Negative 367 pI have a form a where fields are named like  codedata[Field][0][value], data[Field][1][value]code, et cetera, where the integer increments but the rest stays the same. Is there a way of finding out the lowest available integer value with jQuery p  pMy form uses JS to dynamically add and remove fields some of which are created by the PHP backend on page load, so I need the lowest integer so as to create fields without conflicts. p  pRight now on page load, I set codefieldcountcode to code input[name[value] .lengthcode and then increment it as I create my inputs. This prevents any namespace collisions, however it doesnt take removed inputs into consideration Id like to be able to reuse the names of removed fields.p

IMHO, It happens because the program doesnt save all the dictionary on time, and when I close the program, the file remains unreadable. In other words, IMHO, the program doesnt complete on time dump procedure and file is corrupted. But Im not sure.

Negative 367 pIm trying to write a simple node.js server with Server Sent Event abilities without socket.io. My code runs well enough, but I ran into a huge problem when I was testing it.p  pIf I connect to the node.js server from my browser, it will receive the server events fine. But when I refresh the connection, the same browser will start to receive the event twice. If I refresh n times, the browser will receive data n1 times.p  pThe most I tried this out with was 16 times 16 refreshes before I stopped trying to count it.p  pSee the screenshot below of the console from my browser. After the refresh it tries to make an AJAX call, it will output SSE persistent connection established and afterwards it will start receiving events.p  pNote the time when the events arrive. I get the event twice at 193407 it logs to the console twice  upon receipt of the event and upon writing of the data to the screen so you can see four logs there.p  pI also get the event twice at 193412.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comOlBrs.png altclient sidep  pHeres what it looks like at the server side after the client has closed the connection with source.close p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comrky2E.png altserver sidep  pAs you can see, it is still trying to send messages to the client Also, its trying to send the messages twice so I know this is a server side problemp  pI know it tries to send twice because it sent two heartbeats when its only supposed to send once per 30 seconds.p  pThis problem magnifies when open n tabs. What happens is each open tab will receive nn events. Basically, how I interpret it is thisp  pOpening the first tab, I subscribe to the server once. Opening the second tab, I subscribe both open tabs to the server once again  so thats 2 subscriptions per tab. Opening a third tab, I subscribe all three open tabs to the events once more, so 3 subscriptions per tab, total of 9. And so on...p  pI cant verify this, but my guess is that if I can create one subscription, I should be able to unsubscribe if certain conditions are met ie, heartbeat fails, I must disconnect.  And the reason this is happening is only because of the followingp  ol liI started setInterval once, and an instance of it will forever run unless I stop it, orli liThe server is still trying to send data to the client trying to keep the connection openli ol  pAs for 1., Ive already tried to kill the setInterval with clearInterval, it doesnt work.

Negative 367 pBasically Ive got a VPS setup but I incorrectly set the hostname. I left it for a while and it was fine, installed zpanel etc and now its a web host and everything was fine. Now I want to change the hostname so I logged into the hosting companies control panel for the server and changed the hostname. p  pThe original and the new hostname are in the format of xxx.yyy.com. So nothing happend and I could still reach the zpanel login page via the old host name even though in the hosting companies control panel it said it had changed. p  pFor ease of explanation, we shall say my old hostname was xyz.exampledomain.com and my new is server.anotherdomain.com. Both domains are controlled within this installation of zpanel. p  pAnyway. I deleted the dns entry for xyz on exampledomain and, as you would expect, if you go to xyz.exampledomain.com you get nothing. I created a dns A record for server.anotherdomain.com but now all you get is the default apache welcome to your server page. To get to zpanel login, you need the IP address. p  pSO my question is, do I need to do something else It seems that I need to change where this zpanel login page is getting displayed so that it can be server.anotherdomain.com. Im guessing there is some file somewhere that I need to edit but I dont know what one and the internet isnt really helping as all I find is change the host name in the hosting companies control panel which Ive done.p  pPS It is an apache 2 server running CentOS 6p

Negative 367 pdoes anyone know how can I get the exact values from JPG image, for example I have created an image that only contains values from 0  255, this image is on gray scale, that means  RGB values are exactly the same. In the other hand I exactly know the value from each pixel in each position, but when I use the getRGB Im gettin values that does not match with the original values. Eg p  pI have a 0 in the position [0][0] the getRGB is returning a decimal number 13 in the next position [0][1] I have a 1 but the getRGB is returning a decimal number 13 too... So guys I know that these values can be because of the compression of the image. But anyone has an idea of what adjust I can make to get the correct valuesp  pI will appreciate any help..p

Negative 367 pIm supposed to write exceptions to prevent invalid objects, such as Strings having no blanks or the double and int numbers being in a certain range. I am really confused on how to do this. Am I supposed to use an ifelse statement Or more trycatch statements p  pEDIT Each object needs to be validated. The strings cannot have blanks or contain only blanks, and the numbers cannot be less than zero. There are five other trycatch statements but I only included one.  My question is what would I write so that the exception output is different for the different problems and is there a way to write it to avoid writing each exception for each separate trycatch I looked at other posts about writing exceptions but I havent learned what super is or does and cannot use it. p  precodepublic class CD      String artistname       String albumname       double cdprice  0     int amountinstock  0      public CDfinal String artistname, final String albumname, final double cdprice, final int amountinstock          this.artistname  artistname         this.albumname  albumname         this.cdprice  cdprice         this.amountinstock  amountinstock           public static void mainfinal String[] arg throws Exception           try              final CD cd1  new CDMuse, The Resistance, 11.99, 20             System.out.printlncd1.toString             System.out.println          catch final CDException cde              System.out.printlncde.getMessage             System.out.println                codepre

Negative 367 pI am developing a prototype appwebsite as a spike for a project feasibility study. We need both a website and an app. p  pI have come from a web formsc background with fair amount of sql experience.. and have been up a steep learning curve to get to grips with MVC, Entity framework etc.p  pI have developed an MVC app first which has OAuth and uses Asp.Identity and roles  just couldnt stay away im afraid.p  pThis uses an Azure Website and Webjobs to handle other tasks.. I really like the idea of not having to manage the whole server.p  pFollowing what seems the logical step for a mobile app, I have also added Web Api to it.. and have done some successful checks that it is there and working using fiddler etc.p  pI now need to Spike the mobile element of this and quite favour the Cordova approach since there are no real performance requirements and it looks like AngularJS etc can yield good gains. So I have added the Cordova tools to my dev environment and done a couple of the tutorials and successfully have an app on my android phone.. so far so good.p  pSo looking at Azure Mobile services, this seems to offer some nice facilities for our app.. however, and I realise it is still new, but it does seem geared to wards a NodeJS server side application if using Cordova.. is this fixed or am I OK using C But also I feel I may have circumvented the need for the Mobile services part by adding WebApi..p  pOn the surface it looks like the mobile services is a great cloud as service model for simple app only requirements. Or am I wrong .. and should I be using it IN ADDITION to my website.. p  pThe APP and Website are going to use the same database, authentication etc. Which brings me on to the database.. This is not really an existing database which is where all the tutorials for Mobile Services seem to head.. I can start again if needed.. but of course it is built with code first EF models.p  pShould I divert energies to using mobile services or, as I am suspecting, carry on developing my own RESTful apis added on to my website.p  pI guess I am looking for some best practice guidance here.p

Negative 367 pI just had this question on an final exam for an introductory CS course. I thought it was pretty interesting but I couldnt fully figure it out. I tried coding it out on Eclipse for a while and wasnt getting anywhere. I have a Biochem exam soon so I really should be studying for that but this is bugging me... Thought I would ask for help.p  pQuestion  Write an algorithm for the following  Given an input array, A, with 2 indices  start and stop  calculate the sum between the two. The array is sorted and all elements belong to the set 1, 2, 3. This algorithm must run in Ologn. So given an array 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3 with indices 1 and 5 it would return 11.p  pThis is what I have so farp  precodepublic static int findSumint[] a, int start, int stop       int sum  0      int temp[]  new int[4]     int mid  startstop2      while mid gt start  mid lt stop           if a[mid1]a[mid]  0              temp[mid1]  mid1             temp[mid]  mid             mid                  else              findSuma, start, mid             findSuma, mid1, stop                   for int i  4 i gt 0 i          if temp[i]  0              temp[i]  temp[i1]                   for int i  1 i lt 4 i          sum  itemp[i]temp[i1]          return sum  codepre  pDont know if my logic is correct at all but my idea was to look for indices in the array where the numbers shift and to do so in a recursive manner where I keep splitting the array into two parts. With these indices, I can determine the frequency in which the numbers appear and thus multiple the numbers by these frequencies and add those up to calculate the sum.p  pPretty sure my algorithm has numerous flaws in it...p

Negative 367 pIve been trying to update a legacy webservice from axis1 to JAXWS due to classloader conflicts with the old axis1 jars. p  pIve taken the old WSDLs and used wsimport to generate JAXWS classes.

Negative 367 pThrough my experience I bumped into some odd behaviors when using printf or any other std out logging  for debugging .p  pBehavior 1 p  pOne common scenario Is when using printf in multithreaded applications in order to find why certain bugs are occurring, and using printf suddenly fixed the bugs ofc printfs where agressivelly called, resulting in a huge output. p  pIn this scenario I consider that printf adds some delays so there might be some low priority threads that dont get CPU, so I start looking in that direction.p  pAnother direction I look after the miracle printf fix is on synchronization, because I speculate that calls to printf, although multithreaded , are synchronized behind by the system, so the different threads with printf get synchronized between themselves by waiting for each other to finish writing to the IO buffer.p  pQ1  Are my two suppositions regarding the first scenario correct  p  pQ2  Are there any other directions I should take into consideration when such  a scenarios occurs p  pBehavior 2 p  pThis scenario very rarely happens , but when bumped into it will make even senior developers question themselves, and I would really appreciate an explanation regarding this.p  pIt goes something like this p  ul licode doesnt work ... clean, compile , runli licode still doesnt work , so you add a printf to see why clean, compile, runli licode starts working fine .... you remove the previously added printf clean, compile, runli lithe code works fine now  scratch head, stare in disbelief .li ul  pIn practice I used this approach more then once this approach to fix the CPU may pe pegged bug more then once when it occurred  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8458404androidcpumaybepeggedbugAndroid quotcpu may be peggedquot buga .  p  pIt actually worked so well, that it became a known fix and if it didnt work from the first try, you just repeat the process until it was gone.p  pPlease note that the code was properly cleaned it was never the problem of linking with older compiled objects.p  pOne of the most popular speculations is the fact that the compiled code is different , for unknown reasons do compilers have some random according to lines of a certain file including whitespaces  .p  pQ3  What can be the cause this behavior Im open to speculations as well  Can a compiler generate different assembly although the code is the same p  pPlease note that the projects Im talking about are quite large, with multiple static libraries, so these behaviors arent replicable on small code snippets although Ive heard of scenario 2 happening on a singlefile program as well.p

Negative 367 pI was looking at the a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosdocumentationMapKitReferenceMapKitFrameworkReference relnofollowMap Kit Frameworka documentation and it got me wondering why some classes are referred as objects. I know his may be a lack of knowledge on OOP in general but I need to ask.p  pFor instance, this is how they are describing the MKDirections class in the a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosdocumentationMapKitReferenceMapKitFrameworkReference relnofollowMapKit Frameworka Reference.p  ul liemAn MKDirections strongobjectstrong provides you with routebased directions data from Apple servers.emli ul  pAnd this is how they describe the MKDirectionsRequest class.p  ul liemThe MKDirectionsRequest strongclassstrong is used by apps that work with turnbased directions.emli ul  pIs there a reason why they couldnt describe the MKDirections class in a similar fasion as the MKDirectionsRequest class In other words something like...p  ul liemThe MKDirections strongclassstrong is used to provide you with routebased directions data from Apple servers.emli ul  pMy main confusion comes because I was under the impression that you create an object as soon as you instantiate a class. In other words we know that an object will be created when using the MKDirections class so, why not call it class.p  pSorry if my question doesnt make any sense but Im curious if there is something I should be aware when reading the documentation and I come across these two different references, is there something special on the classes they describe as objectsp  pThanksp

Negative 367 pAssume my local server codeAcode clock is at code1822015 000100code GMT 8p  pcodeAcode sent an api request which contains parameters codestarttimecode and codeendtimecode in unix time. Eg. code1424131200code 1722015 000000 and code1424217599code 1722015 235959 respectively.p  pRemote server codeBcode stored a timestamp column called codecreatedatcode in unixtime, which means the timezone is interpreted based on the codeBcodes timezone clock settings p  pNow, codeBcode supposedly reads the timestamp parameter as it is, using the same time zone. But, I notice that codeBcode queried it wrongly. After googling for solutions, I found that because codeBcode is using UTC as its timezone. Meaning that the clock in codeBcode is 8 hours behind codeAcode.p  pSo, instead of querying code1722015  12amcode until code1722015  11.59pmcode, it queried code1722015  12amcode until code1722015  3.59pmcode. Notice the difference between the end time, 11.59pm and 3.59pm 8 hours difference.p  pI guess codeBcodes clock is always 8 hours behind codeAcodes clock at the time of api request, which is at code1722015 160100code. So, the query result always returns wrong information. It will be fine if the api request is executed the same time as the remote server. p  pI dont how to explain this, but this problem is giving me a headache to synchronize it all. How do I deal with this issue I cant seem to find any explanation on this. Is using unix timestamp in mysql server a best practicep

Negative 367 pIm building a peer to peer marketplace and am trying to introduce item quantities for both buyers and sellers.  I do not have a shopping cart and users buy the product directly from the item page.  p  pRight now the seller can choose the quantity of items they have for sale when they upload an item.  I have quantity as a column on the items table in the db.    p  pMy confusion comes when the buyer selects a quantity that they would like to purchase.  I thought I would just add another column to the items table like quantitypurchased and when the buyer submits a quantity on the item page it would update this column, the price, etc.  Im sure the problems with this are obvious if more than one buyer, or even interested party, exists.    p  pIm hoping someone here might be able to provide a different way to think about the solution without having to add a shopping cart. p  pThank you for any help.  Every tutorial, SO question, etc assumes the existence of a shopping cart.    p

Negative 367 pIm having problems with how items appear in the Android Studio Designer and my phone.

When I click the button on my phone, there is no button down effect, yet in the emulator, the effect is present. This is problematic because I want my designs to be consistent across all devices. p

Negative 367 pIm using Browserify for my project, but I think this question also impacts development in NodeJS as well. Im writing a Backbone  Marionette project and I want to override the codesynccode method for the entire project. For example, I want to use the Backbone.dualStorage. p  pWhen working in the global scope it all made sense to me. You import Backbone with a codescriptcode tag first, then import the dualsync script next to override methods.p  pRight now I modified the Backbone.dualStorage to export a function which takes codeBackbonecode and codecode as inputsp  precodemodule.exports  functionBackbone,        It has some special methods for handling local data    Backbone.Collection.prototype.syncDirty  functionoptions            It stores the original Backbone.sync    backboneSync  Backbone.DualStorage.originalSync  Backbone.sync      Builds a specy dualsync method     Then it overrides it    Backbone.sync  dualsync      Then my modification was to return the new Backbone object with the     prototypes modified...    return Backbone  codepre  pAnd I import it withp  precodevar Backbone  requirebackbone var   requirelodash Backbone  requiremycustombackbonedualstorageBackbone,  codepre  pIf I call the require on this more than once I get a an error stating that Ive got a stack overflow since it creates an infinite loop of the new dualsync calling the old sync, which calls dualsync etc. So now Im not sure when and where I need to coderequirecode this module Ive made. This approach feels hacky.p  pBut I have other reasons that I might want to modify the prototypes of other modules I have. I might want to turn off local syncing entirelyp  precodeBackbone.Collection.prototype.local  false codepre  pBut where in the project would I do this Doesnt browserify keep declarations local to the module scope How do I make sure this change is made throughout the project Whats the best practice for thisp

I do this through 2 bridging tables.p  pHowever, the remaining dimension is that the 2 bridge tables must keep integrity too  Attribute and ProdcutType must stay true to their group hierarchy.p  pMy first though, was to create a trigger on ProductTypesAttributes that join the 6 tables together and checkes for existence but there could be easier or more robust solutions Im not aware of as a SQL newbie.p  pId appreciate any advice with regard to better, or just alternative ways of managing this relationship.p  pThanks in advance.p
Negative 367 pI am using the a hrefhttpswww.aleksey.comxmlsec relnofollowxmlseca library to verify the signature of an a hrefhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiSAML2.0 relnofollowSAMLa assertion. My code is almost identical to the a hrefhttpswww.aleksey.comxmlsecapixmlsecverifywithrestrictions.html relnofollowverify4.ca example provided on the xmlsec web page.p  pI am linking against the xmlsecopenssl lib, so using openssl as the crypto engine.p  pI was expecting that xmlsec would consider the signature valid only if it was signed with one of the specific certificates I had loaded into the key manager.p  pHowever, the signature seems to be considered valid if signed with ANY certificate that can be verified by openssl. This means that someone could forge an SAML response just by buying a certificate from a trusted root CA and using that to sign whatever response they want.p  pNot only that, but the a hrefhttpswww.aleksey.comxmlsecxmlsecman.html relnofollowxmlsec1a command line tool provided with the library seems to do the same thingp  precodexmlsec1 verify dtdfile saml.dtd pubkeycertpem mycert.cer samplesamlassertion.xml  ...

That would simplify matters when the sender of the SAML responses changed their signing key. But I have not been able to find a simple way to extract the details of the cert that was used to verify the signature.p  pFailing that, can I make it accept only the certificates I have specified when verifying the signaturep

Negative 367 pI currently have a counter system implemented using Mysql with optimistic locking.  So when there are many concurrent processes accessing the same row in the database to increment the counter in transactions, some of these processes will fail, hence result in overall incorrect count. br  Using pessimistic locking solves this problem but drastically reduces performance so its not usable. br When looking at NoSQL optionseg. redis, canandra, Im wondering if they support these concurrency controls  If so, are they much more performant than their RDBMS counterpart br NoSQL is known for storing and updating counters, but how does it deal with concurrency in a way that has moreor less data integrity than RDBMSp

Negative 367 pIm using Anaconda and Python 2.7 on Ubuntu 12.04. I have created several packages and one of them is named codemybasicscode where I keep some classes and tools that I use over and over.p  pThe package is a work in progress as I come fully up to speed with Python after years of PHP. I originally created the package with only 2 files which contained a few classes in each file. The directory which holds those 2 files now holds several other files as well.p  pThe issue Im having is that for longest time when I imported and do codedirmybasicscode only the original 2 files appear. I have rebuilt the package via codepython setup.py installcode several times. The codepython setup.py installcode appears to work for changes within those 2 files but did not include any of the new files.p  pThe package directory is like thisp  precodehomegabepythonlibmybasics   .bin   .build   .docs   .mybasics     init.py     cBaseClass.py     cBeanstalk.py     cHelpers.py     ...   setup.py codepre  pThe codesetup.pycode file is simplep  precode  coding utf8   from distutils.core import setup  setup     namemybasics,     version0.1.0,     authorG Spradlin,     authoremailgabe.spradlinremoved.com,     packages[mybasics],     packagedirmybasicsmybasics,     scripts[],     url,     licenseLICENSE.txt,     descriptionBasic Python functions and Classes.,     longdescriptionopenREADME.txt.read,  codepre  pThe codeinit.pycode file is emptyp  precode  coding utf8   Created on Tue Sep  9 161529 2014  author gabe  codepre  pSo as I was writing this post originally none of the new files were working. Spyder crashed and I brought it back up. Voila all but the newest file now imported as expected. So I rebuilt it using python setup.py install again, shut down Spyder, rebooted the machine. Still no go on the latest file.p  pIm wondering if there is something about packages Im missing. It really only seems to be in this package. I have a couple of others that are also works in progress and I dont remember ever having this issue with them.p  pThanks for any helpsuggestions.p
Negative 367 pI am working in a project that has a large postgreSQL database. The previous project was developed in Java from scratch. We are now developing that in Laravel. The previous system had codeuser managementcode system similar to codeZizacoentrustcode. So, we used in our system as well. The previous table had codemodulecode table instead of codepermissioncode table used in codeentrustcode. We have already configured that by changing the table name in codeconfigentrust.phpcode. However, the previous system has codepermissionnamecode instead of codenamecode field used in codeentrustcode. How do I config codeentrustcode to use the unique codepermissionnamecode instead of codenamecode field.p  pI am looking for a solution, so that we dont have to change in the codesourcescode of codeentrustcode because then upgrading it would break the system. Can it be configured in the modelp

Negative 367 pBefore I start, I want to tell that I am new to building RESTful APIs and also have never dealt with any authentication. p  pI want to setup a main server which will get API requests from client let the server IPDomain be, api.example.com. I want to be able to use POST request to send a file to the server with an API key. What are the ways that I could authenticate the API key in the main server and then POST the file again from there to another server depending on the API key like two categories 0 and 1p  pIf the file is publicly available on client server, is it good if I just send the url to the main server which passes it to the second server and then download the file there  Once that is done, the client will also have to use a GET request.p  pI am thinking of having wordpress on main server to make registrations easy write a plugin to generate api to each user. Is it a good idea  p  pI have seen this  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11830338webapicreatingapikeysWeb API creating API keysap  pBut the client side will be public all the client side services I will write will be open source and the api itself is open for developers to develop for their own need. So I figured hashing the key with any method can be reversed because its public. I just want to use a single API key around 30 characters and their email and match it in main server.p  pEDITp  pI just figured out something, but i dont know if its a good strategy. If I could ask the users to add the domain from which the will make the request, and then just have only one API key and send it to the server so the server could match between the APIKey and the Domain and if it is listed continue with the POST.p

Negative 367 pIve spent quite some time trying to figure out how to use auto layout and size classes to create a grid 4x4 of equal sized buttons with fixed margins that expand to fit the size of the target device. The problem is that the widths will be different on every device with a different width which is more than the compactanyregular provided by size classes. p  pHas anyone done this so that widths are based on a calc such as this where N is the number of buttonsp  pbutton width  device frame width  N  1  margin  Np  pThe alternative is to do the layout in code which I know I can do with minimal code. At this point, it seems like if I can actually get auto layout to sort of work, it will be at the price of a very fragile configuration that will need pages and pages of documentation so I can figure it out again a year from now.p

Negative 367 pI have had this issue since a while in Visual Studio making a Windows Store app, and have done research on it, but no one seems to have any thoughts about it  except, perhaps, as suggested by windows being sure everything is on a 4x4 grid msdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsappsdn958435.aspx, which seems impossible.p  pNevertheless, my problem concerns the image sizes. In the package.appxmanifest, one must choose various visual assets having different sizes such as 70x70px, 270x270px, 310x310px, and so on.p  pBut, starting from my main image, as the picture is scaled down, it gets more and more blurry. Contrast that to the standard Windows apps, and it really seems ugly.p  pI tried various solutions, like bringing the image resolution up, different formats, etc., but nothing seems to work  unless your assets are absolutely square, which is not my case although I am using a temporary fix to that effect.p  pHowever, I did find that by using purposely oversized images, the problem is resolved at least after a warning that the image is scaled incorrectly. But that leads me to three pointsp  ul liDo I accept the corresponding bloatli liWill the application function under normal conditions if the assets are too large what does the Windows Store do about thisli liIs there a more standard way of fixing thisli ul  pJust so you can see, here is a sample of the possible original image as it looks reduced and blurry a hrefhttpssmediacacheak0.pinimg.comoriginalsbd5583bd5583127c885d0cf76fa64fb9859dd5.png relnofollowBlurry logoap  pAnd here is how it should really look a hrefhttpssmediacacheak0.pinimg.comoriginalsfa71ecfa71ec2a168b190f12761e05c33330b6.png relnofollowNormal logoap
Negative 367 pI would like to show my problem first before showing my code at the end.  I want to create an attached property used on codeAnimationTimelinecode to help animate nonanimatable properties including all nonDependencyProperties. The idea here is hook up the input codeTargetPropertycode and animate a property of the same type of a dummy UIElement. This dummy UIElement exposes an event called codeValueChangedcode so that we can hook up and update the nonanimatable property of the actual object there.p  pMore specifically, I would like to animate the codePositioncode property of a codeMediaElementcode. I want to make it play backwards and repeatedly. It runs fairly smoothly even for dozens of cycles if you just watch it for such as ten cycles, you will be deceived and may think ah everything is OK. Yes but after that it may stop running. I dont have any clue on why it could happen.

By looking at the source code of codeUIElementCollectioncode, I saw some methods called there emAddLogicalChild, VisualCollection.Add and visualParent.InvalidateMeasureem.  So Ive tried calling codeInvalidateMeasurecode on the codeUIElementcode but did not add it to the visual tree this time and looks like it also almost works OK. Ive tried it many times, let it run for hours and everything seems OK but somehow in another time running the app it was just failed once a very rare time of failing. At least it works better now in sense of not stopping too soon and sometimes totally working. So this problem is really tricky. Its totally confusing about the relationship between animating a codeDependencyPropertycode which any codeDependencyObjectcode can have and the UIElements layout I mean the involvement of codeInvalidateMeasurecode call.p

Negative 367 pOk, everyone knows that a global sessionperapplication with NHibernate is discouraged. BUT I have a very specific, apparently nonstandard use case for which it seems to be the ideal solution.p  pTo sum it up, my server application basically has all of its persistent data constantly inmemory and never queries the database for normal operation. The only reason for a database in the first place is so that the data survives the lifetime of the process. I only want to query the database on application startup to fetch everything into memory. The database is only about 510 MB realistically.p  pNow the problem is that if I follow the advice that sessions must be short lived, I have to merge all my data for every business transaction or somehow manually track all changes, instead of taking advantage of NHibernates automatic change tracking. This makes persistence very difficult to implement without causing a lot of performance overhead.p  pSo my question is whether there are any reasons why I shouldnt use a global session for this particular use casep  pCommon arguments against global sessions that I know ofp  ol lipFirst level cache will be filled with entire database over time  I dont mind that, since I actually emwantem to have all data in memorypli lipStale data and concurrency problems  My application is designed so that all code that can access or modify persistent data must be single threaded a deliberate design choice, and it is the only application that can write to the database. So this shouldnt be a problem.pli lipSession gets corrupted if it throws an exception e.g. DB timeout  Thats the only real problem I can see, but can be solved by discarding the session, creating a new one and refreshing all data. Expensive, but exceptions should be very rare and can only be caused either by a major bug or major infrastructure problems, which should both be solved ASAP.pli ol  pSo I believe there is no reason why I shouldnt use a global session emfor my particular use caseem. Or is there something important that Im missingp  pemUpdate 1 Its a server applicationemp  pemUpdate 2 This doesnt imply a longlived global transactions. Transactions would still be shortlived  one longlived session, many shortlived transactions.emp

Negative 367 pTrying to encapsulate some logic in an extension method that will provide a ToSelectList method on a given IEnumerable, but Ive hit a snag and Im hoping someone can help to get me on the right track.p  pEssentially, I have one override thats fine.  I have known fields that I use from a given base class, and the code looks as followsp  precodepublic static IEnumerableltSelectListItemgt ToSelectListthis IEnumerableltBaseModelgt list      return list.Selectt gt new SelectListItem  Text  t.Description, Value  t.Id.ToString   codepre  pNot a problem.  Known fields.  The problem comes when I want to use specific fields from classes derived from BaseModel, but want to specify those from the calling code to make a more generic version of this method.p  pEssentially, Im looking to use lambdas in the calling code to specify the two properties that I want to retrieve from the items in the list like sop  precodemyEnumerable.ToSelectListtextSelector gt textSelector.Id.ToString, valueSelector gt valueSelector.DisplayName codepre  pSo Id have a method that looks like the followingp  precodepublic static IEnumerableltSelectListItemgt ToSelectListltTgtthis IEnumerableltBaseModelgt list, [DONT KNOW WHAT GOES HERE] textExpression, [DONT KNOW WHAT GOES HERE] valueExpression     return list.CastltTgt.Selectt gt new SelectListItem  Text  textExpressiont, Value  valueExpressiont.ToString   codepre  pIm trying to work out what I need to do to enable me to then use those within the expression used for the Select to use those fields as the values to assign to the properties of the codeSelectListItemcode.  Im guessing there must be something similar underneath the LINQ codeIEnumerableltTgt.ToDictionarycode method where theres an expression for the key and another for the value.p  pIs this even possible  Happy to cut my losses if its not.  At the moment, however, Im struggling to get my head around what Id need to pass to my ToSelectList method as parameters  is it an codeExpressionltTgtcode, a codeFuncltTgtcode, an codeExpressionltFuncltTgtgtcode  I dont mind admitting that I get quite lost in the expression evaluation stuff.p
Negative 367 pLong time lurker here, havent been able to figure out the answer to this question so Im posting up for help.  p  pUsing an application that integrates with active directoryexchange.

The last columns furthest to the right in the spreadsheet have repeating headers of ACTION TYPE, and ACTION DATE as seen below p  precodeACTION DATE  ACTION TYPE  ACTION DATE  ACTION TYPE  ACTION DATE  ACTION TYPE codepre  pThis is where it becomes dynamic because for every row, there is a unique  of columns which is dependent on the number of Actions performed.p  pBelow would be a simple example where 3 actions occur with a ticket, ie 1. Submit from requester, 2. Comment, and 3. Close of ticket  Note This is 6 columns because before every ACTION TYPE column there is the corresponding ACTION DATE showing when the action occurredp  precode7142015 62119 PM  Submitted  7152015 935  Commented  7152015 917  ApprovedClosed codepre  pWHAT I NEED VBA TO DO for this portion is to find when every ticket was closed.  This would be the last populated ACTION DATE cell in every row, assuming the ticket was closed.  This could be done a number of different ways, but I was thinking to find the last cell that contains data furthest to right in every row this would always be the ACTION TYPE column.  Once this is found, verify that the value has ApprovedClosed in it not all tickets are closed, and THEN offset one column to the left to copy the closed time. paste into a new column, say column A for example.br If the ticket is still open, there will not be an ApprovedClosed action type as the last used cell in the row..I cant simply just go to the last cell in a row with data and assume that it is closed.p  pIs this possible to do  Is there a better wayp  pThe  of rows and columns is always changing typically around 100 columns and 6000 rows.  The Action Date and Action Type columns usually account for the last 6070 columns in the report.p
