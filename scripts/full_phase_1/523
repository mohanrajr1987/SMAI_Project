I tried spawning a new thread with an apartment state of STAThread for calling the WPF UI but that did not work. I tried using the Dispatcher.BeginInvoke method and Background Worker  as well, but none of them resolved the issue.p  p1 Can we make a call to WPF windowcontrol without marking the Main as an STAThread If it is possible, Can anyone please point me to a proper direction  2 If the only way to accomplish this is by making the Main Thread an STAThread, will there be any impact to the general performanceresponsiveness of the application.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 523 pWere building a method of connecting components visually via a GUI in a Visual C application MFC. Simple things like clicking on boxes and drawing lines between those that are connected, and storing information on them. The problem is that were making all this by ourselves from the ground up in GDI and it quickly becomes a heck of a lot of code to maintain.p  pAre we really reinventing the wheel herep  pIve looked around on the web for components that provide an objectoriented 2D framework vector graphics being interesting here. Objectoriented in the sense that a square on the screen is a square object in code, or at least that you can store custom information on the graphical object. It should support retrieving information on object positions etc in code to draw lines between objects, and detect whether the mouse is over an object or not.p  pNot really complicated things, but it becomes quite complicated and hard to maintain if there are hundreds or thousands of line to maintain just because you wrote all of it yourself, not to mention the potential for bugs creeping in, that would be avoided in a mature framework.p

This is because showing several forms 4 or 5 one after another to the user makes the app blink, and also very annoying, while replacing just components is much smoother. This model works, but seems very nasty, and I would like a cleaner way to handle this.p  pstrongUpdatestrong I updated the code sample so that variable names are somewhat speaky. Still, Im convinced this is awful, a but not sure how much, and more importantly, b how to do it better.p  pstrongUpdate 2strong So, it seems that the code is still a bit mysterious.p  pNow heres what the problem is I show the user a form, which instructs him what to do in several languages. He proceeds by clicking OK on the window. Next, I ask for his language, and then a few questions where hisher GPS is, etc. like this. After he could answer the questions this shouldnt take more than a few seconds each, I show him a splash screen I load stuff in a separate thread meanwhile, which has a picture. Showing these forms one after another makes the whole application start slow, and filled with UI lags.p  pHeres what I do to work around the lags I put the content of the windows into panels, and put those panels one on another, and hide every one of them but the one that should be visible to the user. codecurrentcode variable Each of the windows does different things, so I need to change handler of the window codeclosingcode event in addition. In this code the part which enables the panel is in the same function codehandler1code, codehandler2code, etc. with the part which handles the window closing event. If the arguments are codenullcode, it does the former, if it isnt that means it was triggered by the user it does the latter.p  pI need an extensible solution to this so that I can insert and remove dialogs anytime I want the order and the pointers to the functions are stored in the codeCONTROLScode field, and this seems to be very convenient, if you actually understand it. Although it is never easy to change the entire content of a form, there ought to be a simpler way to do this, as well a nicer one, that is what Im looking for.p  pI hope this time I could explain how the model works.p

For example, Hopcrofts automaton minimisation algorithm is On log n  but if you start using binary tree containers for the states, transitions and intermediate results, the steps themselves become Olog n  the On log n is no longer valid because the assumption of O1 accesses is invalid.p  pStill, people will claim that there are n states and m transitions, but n and m tend to be linearly related for automata, assuming that the number of transition annotations is constant and that the automata are moreorless deterministic.p  pI havent worried too much about this in the past  the cases I work with arent very big. But, well, Im doing a major refactoring of my automata code, and I thought I might as well do the math properly for some key algorithms as I go.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pIm also increasingly convinced that the n log n log n is wrong.p  pIf a is Ob log b where b is Olog c, what is a in terms of cp

This means that I would have to adddelete records in the lookup table based on the new contract [EndDate] and to me this seems a bit messy.p  pSo this leads me to my question, is there a pure SQL approach that can get me a schedule of notifications without creating a look up table Cursors are not allowed P but I hoping CTEs would work here.p  pIf I have not given enough information then please ask.p

Is there any other book better to understand maven from top to bottomp  pSecond part of the question is relating an example in this book, maybe a simple explanations would resolve my doubts. p  pHere is the thing, I made a codesimpleweathercode project in java which retrieves the weather conditions from yahoo weather server, given the particular zip code it returns weather information. p  pThen I made an simplewebappwith maven as well as the one above I forgot to mention that, which is basicaly a web project which has some default servlet already there with maven and it does nothing.p  pAnd I have some codeparentprojectcode I wanna merge those two projects into one, so I made a pom.xml which has 2 modules , 1 to retrieve infojava project and other to display it on the web web app. p  pI made everything work at the end, but here is the odd thing .. if I make webapp display any string name lets say then build it independently, it does exactly print that string. But when I put the webapp in the parentproject and change this string to name1 and build it as sa partentproject sub module.. nothing changes ..p  pSo I go back to the point, because simplewebapp is dependent on simpleweather I cant build it anymore on its own, so now if I wanna make some changes to the webapp.. modify the webapp outside the parentproject build it there then paste it back to the parentproject and then the changes will apply, why is that, why cant I directly change the servlet contentor add another one in the webapp as the part of the parentprojectp  pThank you.. I know its a long and boring question, but Im just trying to learn things and there is no better place to ask than here Dp  pstrongEDIT  HERE ARE POM FILES FOR EACH PROJECT strongp  pstrong1. simpleparent pom.xmlstrongp  precode ltproject xmlnshttpmaven.apache.orgPOM4.0.0     xmlnsxsihttpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchemainstance     xsischemaLocationhttpmaven.apache.orgPOM4.0.0     httpmaven.apache.orgmavenv400.xsdgt     ltmodelVersiongt4.0.0ltmodelVersiongt     ltgroupIdgtorg.sonatype.mavenbook.multiltgroupIdgt     ltartifactIdgtsimpleparentltartifactIdgt     ltpackaginggtpomltpackaginggt     ltversiongt1.0ltversiongt     ltnamegtMulti Chapter Simple Parent Projectltnamegt ltmodulesgt ltmodulegtsimpleweatherltmodulegt ltmodulegtsimplewebappltmodulegt ltmodulesgt ltbuildgt ltpluginManagementgt ltpluginsgt ltplugingt ltgroupIdgtorg.apache.maven.pluginsltgroupIdgt ltartifactIdgtmavencompilerpluginltartifactIdgt ltconfigurationgt ltsourcegt1.5ltsourcegt lttargetgt1.5lttargetgt ltconfigurationgt ltplugingt ltpluginsgt ltpluginManagementgt ltbuildgt ltdependenciesgt ltdependencygt ltgroupIdgtjunitltgroupIdgt ltartifactIdgtjunitltartifactIdgt ltversiongt3.8.1ltversiongt ltscopegttestltscopegt ltdependencygt ltdependenciesgt ltprojectgt codepre  pstrong2. simpleweather pom.xmlstrongp  precodeltproject xmlnshttpmaven.apache.orgPOM4.0.0 xmlnsxsihttpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchemainstance xsischemaLocationhttpmaven.apache.orgPOM4.0.0 httpmaven.apache.orgmavenv400.xsdgt ltmodelVersiongt4.0.0ltmodelVersiongt ltparentgt ltgroupIdgtorg.sonatype.mavenbook.multiltgroupIdgt ltartifactIdgtsimpleparentltartifactIdgt ltversiongt1.0ltversiongt ltparentgt ltartifactIdgtsimpleweatherltartifactIdgt ltpackaginggtjarltpackaginggt ltnamegtMulti Chapter Simple Weather APIltnamegt ltbuildgt ltpluginManagementgt ltpluginsgt ltplugingt ltgroupIdgtorg.apache.maven.pluginsltgroupIdgt ltartifactIdgtmavensurefirepluginltartifactIdgt ltconfigurationgt lttestFailureIgnoregttruelttestFailureIgnoregt ltconfigurationgt ltplugingt ltpluginsgt ltpluginManagementgt ltbuildgt ltdependenciesgt ltdependencygt ltgroupIdgtlog4jltgroupIdgt ltartifactIdgtlog4jltartifactIdgt ltversiongt1.2.14ltversiongt ltdependencygt ltdependencygt ltgroupIdgtdom4jltgroupIdgt ltartifactIdgtdom4jltartifactIdgt ltversiongt1.6.1ltversiongt ltdependencygt ltdependencygt ltgroupIdgtjaxenltgroupIdgt ltartifactIdgtjaxenltartifactIdgt ltversiongt1.1.1ltversiongt ltdependencygt ltdependencygt ltgroupIdgtvelocityltgroupIdgt ltartifactIdgtvelocityltartifactIdgt ltversiongt1.5ltversiongt ltdependencygt ltdependencygt ltgroupIdgtorg.apache.commonsltgroupIdgt ltartifactIdgtcommonsioltartifactIdgt ltversiongt1.3.2ltversiongt ltscopegttestltscopegt ltdependencygt ltdependenciesgt ltprojectgt codepre  pstrong3. simplewebapp pom.xmlstrongp  precodeltproject xmlnshttpmaven.apache.orgPOM4.0.0 xmlnsxsihttpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchemainstance xsischemaLocationhttpmaven.apache.orgPOM4.0.0 httpmaven.apache.orgmavenv400.xsdgt ltmodelVersiongt4.0.0ltmodelVersiongt ltparentgt ltgroupIdgtorg.sonatype.mavenbook.multiltgroupIdgt ltartifactIdgtsimpleparentltartifactIdgt ltversiongt1.0ltversiongt ltparentgt ltartifactIdgtsimplewebappltartifactIdgt ltpackaginggtwarltpackaginggt ltnamegtsimplewebapp Maven Webappltnamegt ltdependenciesgt ltdependencygt ltgroupIdgtjavax.servletltgroupIdgt ltartifactIdgtservletapiltartifactIdgt ltversiongt2.4ltversiongt ltscopegtprovidedltscopegt ltdependencygt ltdependencygt ltgroupIdgtorg.sonatype.mavenbook.multiltgroupIdgt ltartifactIdgtsimpleweatherltartifactIdgt ltversiongt1.0ltversiongt ltdependencygt ltdependenciesgt ltbuildgt ltfinalNamegtsimplewebappltfinalNamegt ltpluginsgt ltplugingt ltgroupIdgtorg.mortbay.jettyltgroupIdgt ltartifactIdgtmavenjettypluginltartifactIdgt ltplugingt ltpluginsgt ltbuildgt ltprojectgt codepre

Negative 523 pI have an ASP.NET 2.0 page with many repeating blocks, including a thirdparty serverside control so its not just plain HTML. Each is quite expensive to generate, in terms of both CPU and RAM. Im currently using a standard Repeater control for this.p  pThere are two problems with this simple approachp  ol liThe entire page must be rendered before any of it is returned to the client, so the user must wait a long time before they see any data. I write progress messages using codeResponse.Writecode, so there is emfeedbackem, but no actual results.li liThe ASP.NET worker process must hold everything in memory at the same time. There is no inherent needs for this once one block is processed it wont be changed, so it could be returned to the client and the memory could be freed.li ol  pI would like to somehow return these blocks to the client one at a time, as each is generated. Im thinking of extracting the stuff inside the Repeater into a separate page and getting it repeatedly using AJAX, but there are some complications involved in that and I wonder if there is some simper approach. Ideally Id like to keep it as one page from the clients point of view, but return it incrementally.p  pAnother way would be to do something similar, but on the server still create a separate page, but have the emserverem access it and then codeResponse.Writecode the HTML it gets to the response stream for the emrealem client request. Is there a way to avoid an HTTP request here, though Is there some ASP.NET method that would render a UserControl or a Page outside of an HTTP request and simply return the HTML to me as a stringp  pIm open to other ideas on how to do this as well.p
Negative 523 h2Longdelayed updateh2  pIm accepting MUG4Ns answer to this question, and I also want to respond to some of the criticisms that were raised against it.p  pChrisF saidp  blockquote   p...you cant make UI calls directly from background threads.p blockquote  pThis is a blanket statement, and is not 100 true. Let me just point out a few factsp  ol lipYou can actually make UI calls emall you wantem if you set codeControl.CheckForIllegalCrossThreadCalls  falsecode. emAckem I hear you saying. emDont strongeverstrong do thatem Yes, yes  but strongwhystrong The answer because strongsometimesstrong this will corrupt memory.p  pThe control classes in codeSystem.Windows.Formscode are not written to be threadsafe, so sometimes updating them from background threads can corrupt memory. But if this only emsometimesem happens and not emalwaysem, what this tells me is that strongit is not the calling of UI code emper seem, but rather the potentially unsafe emcollisionem of UI code that can cause exceptionsstrong.pli lipTo reinforce point 1, consider this the safe way to invoke UI code from a background thread is to do so using codeControl.Invokecode or codeControl.BeginInvokecode, right strongBut this emisem a UI callstrong its just emtheem UI call were supposed to make if were updating the GUI from a nonGUI thread. What I mean is, clearly, it is not simply invoking any method on a codeControlcode object from an outside thread thats going to cause chaos if that were the case, then we couldnt even call codeInvokecode and wed be stuck completely. Again, its the potential collision of separate UI calls that cannot safely occur simultaneously that will prove destructive.pli lipKeeping the above two points in mind, ask yourself why would it be unsafe to call codeMessageBox.Showcode from a nonGUI thread A completely separate codeFormcode is created and displayed its properties do not in any way interact with any other existing GUI object in fact, it cannot be accessed emanywhereem in emany mannerem, except for one from the calling thread, which accesses its codeDialogResultcode property and only that via the codeShowcode methods return value.pli ol  pMoving along. Conrad Albrecht saidp  blockquote   p...given the assertion that Show sets up its own message pump in Dans refd topic, which was not substantiated, but which I cant refute...p blockquote  pThis is a totally fair point though I personally hold Jared Par in high enough esteem that I wouldnt generally be inclined to emdoubtem what he says. In any case, a peek at the codeMessageBox.Showcode method through a hrefhttpwww.redgate.comproductsreflectorReflectora reveals this snippetp  precodeApplication.BeginModalMessageLoop try      result  Win32ToDialogResultSafeNativeMethods.MessageBoxnew HandleRefowner, zero, text, caption, type  finally      Application.EndModalMessageLoop     UnsafeNativeMethods.ThemingScope.DeactivateuserCookie  codepre  pA further peek into the codeApplication.BeginModalMessageLoopcode method reveals thisp  precodeThreadContext.FromCurrent.BeginModalMessageLoopnull codepre  pAnd this codeThreadContext.FromCurrentcode, in turnp  precode [Reflector shows that currentThreadContext is a ThreadStatic member. Dan] if currentThreadContext  null      currentThreadContext  new Application.ThreadContext  return currentThreadContext codepre  pI dont know enough about these lowerlevel Windows constructs to fully understand this code, but this seems to me to be evidence of exactly what Jared was saying in the answer I referenced in my old comment for curious readers a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions559252doesmessageboxshowautomaticallymarshalltotheuithreadDoes MessageBox.Show automatically marshall to the UI Threada.p  pSo, yeah. I am totally in agreement with MUG4N on this one.p  pIf anyone can convincingly argue that I am still mistaken here, please speak up. Although I feel Ive made a pretty good case for why I believe MUG4N is right, Im obviously not 100 certain.p  hr  h2Original questionh2  pOften you just want to notify the user that something has occurred, but theres really no need for any input from them. In this common scenario, I sometimes see code like thisp  precodeMessageBox.ShowSomething has occurred, Something, MessageBoxButtons.OK codepre  pThis code, as we all know, causes a little popup window to appear with only an strongOKstrong button. Now heres the thing this code blocks the UI thread. But in the vast majority of cases, it seems to me, if you emonlyem have an strongOKstrong button, theres very little need to block. Isnt the purpose of blocking typically to receive some input from the user And if the users emonlyem choice is OK, in this typical case, isnt blocking pretty pointlessp  pObviously I could just write my own little form that does basically exactly what codeMessageBox.Showcode does, except that it returns nothing no codeDialogResultcode and doesnt block. But I was just wondering if something like this exists already that I didnt know about.p
Negative 523 pHeres what I want A codeListBoxcode whose items consist of a codeStackPanelcode with two codeTextBlockcodes.

The textblocks seem to be slightly larger than the listbox, causing the horizontal scrollbar to appear.  This is strange because their widths are bound to the lisboxs ActualWidth.  Also, if you add a few more items to the listbox just cut and paste in XamlPad causing the vertical scrollbar to appear, the width of the textblocks do not resize to the vertical scrollbar.p  pHow do I keep the codeTextBlockcodes inside the codeListBoxcode, with or without the vertical scrollbarp

Negative 523 pI currently have some C code that I want to compile into a shared library that I can dynamically link to a Java application during runtime using the Java Native Interface JNI. The problem that Im facing is  the C code that Im trying to compile calls on another library itself, making use of a lot of classes and different header files. When I try to make it into a .dll file, I get a lot of linker errors saying that I have unresolved external symbols  all of which belong to the source code that my C code calls from. Now I dont want to have to copy all of the external code which is actually a library called VTK into my own source  I just want a dynamically linkable library that has my own C codes functionality which means itd would need to be able to still recognize the external code that I dont want to duplicate. p  pPlease feel free to ask any leading questions. p

Negative 523 pI have heard a lot about strongtypestrong system, strongly strongtypedstrong language and so on. Currently I am working on some .NET COM interop problem, which addressed marshaling a lot.

These   structures can have any legal name   there is no relationship between the   native and managed version of the two   structures other than their data   layout. Therefore, it is vital that   the managed version contains fields   that are the same size and in the same   order as the native version. There is   no mechanism for ensuring that the   managed and native versions of the   structure are equivalent, so   incompatibilities will not become   apparent until run time. It is the   programmers responsibility to ensure   that the two structures have the same   data layout.p blockquote  pSo as far as Marshaling is concerned, it is the layout matters.p

Now, before I hooked it up to PayPal, I setup code in PHP to go through and check if each field was valid and sanitize them properly.

Problem is I have no clue how to do that.p  pSo far, my boundary is the forms action. If I want all the fields to be validatedsanitized and have the user put into my database, I set the forms action to the local coderegister.phpcode.

Anyways, the problem I am interested in is finding out pageranks in this scenario. p  pAnd I am using JUNG Java Universal Graph Network for calculating the pageranks.p  pWhen I use the normal procedure,p  precodeGraphltString, Stringgt jungGraph  new DirectedSparseGraphltString, Stringgt PageRankltString, Stringgt pagerank  new PageRankltString,StringgtjungGraph, 0.2 pagerank.setMaxIterations20 pagerank.setTolerance0.000001 pagerank.evaluate codepre  pI get more or less the same pagerank values for all the nodes, when i clearly know that shouldnt be the case. As some nodes in the graph have a large number of outgoing nodes and are strongly interconnected.p  pWhat is the suggested approach in this case. I know there is this class PageRankWithPriors.  Should I first extract the network with no deadlinks, calculate pageranks for them, and then propagate their rank to the deadlinks until they converge. In the latter case, all the nodes in the reduced network outdegree  0  will have their priors set, whereas the deadlinks wont.p  pAm I missing anything herep
Negative 523 pIve recently read section a hrefhttpwww.makelinux.netldd3chp5sect5.shtml relnofollow5.5.2a Spinlocks and Atomic Context of LDDv3 bookp  blockquote   pAvoiding sleep while holding a lock can be more difficult many kernel functions can sleep, and this behavior is strongnot always well documentedstrong. Copying data to or from user space is an obvious example the required userspace page may need to be swapped in from the disk before the copy can proceed, and that operation clearly requires a sleep. Just about any operation that must allocate memory can sleep kmalloc can decide to give up the processor, and wait for more memory to become available unless it is explicitly told not to. Sleeps can happen in surprising places writing code that will execute under a spinlock strongrequires paying attention to every function that you callstrong.p blockquote  pIts clear to me that spinlocks must always be held for the minimum time possible and I think that its relatively easy to write correct spinlockusing code from scratch.p  pSuppose, however, that we have a big project where spinlocks are widely used. How can we make sure that functions called from critical sections protected by spinlocks will never sleep p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 523 pWhile attempting to override the explicit interface implementation of the codeICollectionltTgt.IsReadOnlycode property from the codeCollectionltTgtcode class, I came across some documents stating that explicit interface member implementations cannot be overridden because they cannot have modifiers such as codevirtualcode or codeabstractcode. On a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryaa66459328VS.7129.aspxMSDNa they even go as far as specifying how to make an explicit interface member implementation available for inheritance by creating another abstract or virtual member which is called by the explicit interface member implementation. No problems so far.p  pBut then I wonder strongWhy is it possible in C to override emanyem explicitly implemented interface member just by specifying the interface emexplicitlyemstrongp  pFor example, suppose I have a simple interface like this, with a property and methodp  precodepublic interface IMyInterface      bool AlwaysFalse  get      bool IsTruebool value  codepre  pAnd a class codeAcode which implements the interface explicitly, and has a method codeTestcode which calls its own interface member implementation.p  precodepublic class A  IMyInterface      bool IMyInterface.AlwaysFalse      get  return false        bool IMyInterface.IsTruebool value      return value       public bool Test      return IMyInterfacethis.AlwaysFalse   codepre  pAs you can see, none of the four members are virtual or abstract, so when I define a class codeBcode like thisp  precodepublic class B  A      public bool AlwaysFalse      get  return true        public bool IsTruebool value      return value   codepre  pThen youd expect an instance of codeBcode cast to codeAcode to behave like codeAcode.

Negative 523 pWhat are the limitations, unexpected pitfalls and performance traits of moving from in process C code to SQL CLR Functions p  pWe currently have several data heavy processes that run very fast using in process C Asp.net MVC project without using a db at all.  Performance is very important.  The application uses a static in memory cache and performs complex operations to arrive at a final result.  Cache updating is a bit of a pain and we are considering moving some of these processes to SQL Server queries that would just output the final result so that less data caching is needed at the c app level.  The processes are complex and we know that moving to the database would require extensive use of SQL Server CLR functions.  p  pWe see a lot of advantages in leveraging the database, but the required use of CLR functions gives pause for a few reasonsp  pstrongNo Azurestrong SQL CLR functions are a hrefhttpsimonmunro.com20100208isspatialsupportneededinsqlazure relnofollownot supported by Azurea, p  pstrongHigh Testing Coststrong the SQL CLR functions could be slower and testing will take significant work p  pstrongSmall User Basestrong An hour of googling reveals that use of CLR functions is somewhat uncommon which makes community support and possible MS support a concern. p  pI would love to hear from someone who has moved a C app from in process to CLR functions.p  pIn your answers please assume that custom SQL CLR functions are required.p

Negative 523 pSup guys. Im loading data into a table using ajax and jquery. This can be a lot, so I want to scroll this. Ive put the table in a div. Now Ive built a check in jquery like thisp  precodeifdivresult table.height gt maxHeight     divresult.cssoverflowy, scroll else     divresult.cssoverflowy, hidden codepre  pThis works quite nicely in firefox, but in google Chrome the div also receives an additional 15 marginright. This seems to me like the width of a scrollbar, but is unwanted because the scrollbar is placed within the div, and not outside it. When I look at the div with the chrome development tools, the margin has no css origin. It doesnt show where it came from. Im pretty sure this is something chrome is doing by itself, because Im not doing anything with margins in my jquery code.p  pIs there something Im doing wrong or is this just an chrome oddity If so, what could I do to fix it Preferably without writing too much browserdependant code Or is there a more elegant way to handle this that doesnt have to deal with these problemsp  pBefore you ask I dont want to have overflowy on scroll all the time, because it shows the scrollbar even when all the content fits in the div.p  pThanksp

Negative 523 pI wonder whether someone could possibly please help me with what I hope is a simple fix.p  pI am using the code below, to allow a user to input an address on an input form, click a button which geocodes the address, returning the LatLng coordinates, placing a marker on the map.

Negative 523 pThis is really a thinking out loud type of question, so apologies if this is in the wrong place as its not really a question  more looking for suggestioncomments.p  pIve recently started using Windows Speech Recognition to pretty good effect on Windows 7. Im a reasonably advanced user being a programmer and using it in typing mode is a great way of getting round the PC if you know your shortcuts. The problem I have is moving to another computer. I know you can importexport your speech profile, but the couple of times Ive tried this on a new system the results have been poor possibly due to is missing all the reference material it uses such as emails and documents youve written  not sure. It also, obviously doesnt work on Linux, a Mac, servers or older Windows system.p  pSo that got me thinking wouldnt a neat solution to taking your speech recognition profile with you be solved by a USB speech recognition device. This device would contain just enough software to run, say, Windows Speech recognition maybe as embeded software and store your data in the usual way on the device. The output of this device would basically by key strokes on a generic keyboard. So you could plug this USB device into any other PC with a USB port that expects a keyboard  ie the device would appear to be a keyboard. I dont see why such a device would be larger than say an iPod and I could carry that around me with me whenever I expect to have to use a keyboard.p  pSo my question is does anybody know of such a device. To me  this seems such a neat solution I cant imagine noone has produced something like this. But maybe Im just weirdp  pThanks in advance for any thoughts.p  pRegards,p  pZBp

Negative 523 pI have an entity Library that mains two lists of Books.  It is important that the library maintain these two lists of books.  On my Library entity I have a relationship thats one to many from each list to my Book entity.  Likewise, Book has a relationship library.  Im having some problems with my data being erased from the database and I read that I should be setting up inverse relationships to help with data integrity.  In this case however, a Book would want to be able to set up an inverse relationship with each list on my Library entity.  How can I accomplish thisp  pMy naive first thought is to implement relationships for both lists.  So a book has a relationship libraryForList1 and libraryForList2 so that it can have an inverse for each relationship.  Ill never have to actually reference these properties because according to the Core Data spec, if I add a book to one of the library lists, it automatically takes care of setting the library as that books owner.p

Negative 523 pSo far Im using a hrefhttpsgithub.comjqueryglobalize relnofollowGlobalizea for i18n and l10n of my JavaScript apps built  with jQuery UI. This works, but it ties my code to another specific library. Now Im looking for a way to overcome this issue because I reuse some source that does not support i18n right now and I would rather not change this. Im not talking about using a global interface for i18n where I could plug in any implementation. To summarize How do I add i18n and l10n support to existing applications without changing its source Im not asking if this is a good idea, Im asking if this is possible and how.p  pSo far Ive come up with these approaches, but both have their flawsp  ol lipIf Id rely on the use of jQuery which I could in my case, I could replace the textvalappend etc. methods, i.e. all that manipulate the DOM. But there are quite many of these, of which everyone behaves a little different. I could also take this a step further and replace the DOM methods.pli lipWalk the DOM and replace text nodes and form values. This would work, but it is expensive and dynamic changes are hard to detect since there is no standardized way to do it.pli ol  pThose provide a partial solution to the i18n problem, but for l10n neither of this may work.p  pHow would you approach the problem of adding i18n and l10n support to existing appsp

Negative 523 pIm building a web application with GWT and I want to give users the ability to extend its functionality by some sort of Javascript API that would interact with the app core written in GWT. Basically, this JS API would map to some of my GWT internal methods that would do the actual job.p  pSo, to achieve this, i read on GWT JSNI official documentation a trick that consists in creating a global JS variable from GWT and assigning it a call to the actual GWT method. Then i would make the call in my handwritten JS code through this variable. p  pUnfortunately I couldnt make it to work the example contained syntax errors son im not sure that it has even been tested. Doing more research, i found on this site a similar solution that assigns the JS var an anonymous function that makes the call.

Negative 523 pI am trying to build a program using modelviewcontroller.p  pSpecificallyp  pI have a state manager that handles initializing, loading, running, unloading etc... of a set of MVCs, one at a time.p  pIn each set, the single controller contains a reference to the relevant model and views.p  pEvery model, view and controller are each derived from a parent class. i.e. abstract model, abstract view, abstract controller. This allows me to keep much of the process in the parent classes, rather than adding duplicate code in each specific mvc set the state manager will handle.p  pNow the idea is for each View to call on its Controller methods, which in turn will call on its Model methods, and any resulting changes in the Model will be communicated back to the View through the Controller.p  pThis is where Im stuck. strongThe only knowledge each view and model have of the controller is what is defined in its parent class.strong Which of course does not include the very specific methods the childcontroller will need in order to properly handle the views and model.p  pAre there any ideas on how I can deal with thisp  pThanks.p

Negative 523 pI have a program where Im a table of a decently large block of memory, its a structure with two integers they would have to be at least 4 bytes a piece to hold up to 1,000,000,000.  The structure currently has a little more than 500 entries into it.  So were talking about 4k.  4k of stack space doesnt seem like a lot, but it does seem wasteful for a function that may only be called once in a blue moon.  Assume well call it once over the life time of a program, so if its slightly slow to allocate, its ok as that space is more value over the allocation time.p  pThe code is just a simple look up of values, the code to generate it is quite heavy, and we only are looking for specific values anyways.  Ive the code already, and the look up is by far faster, so theres no question that I want to go down this route.  I could add in a file load to get the data out of a file, but to me that seems overkill at least at this point.  p  pNow theres two ways I can think of allocating it.  Making it a global variable, and making it a local variable.  Obviously, local is the way to go as its only this function that needs the table.  However what Im looking for is if theres any keywords I can use, or any way of loading that variable currently its just a array of these pairs that will be the most beneficial. p  pMy best case is to make it attempt to be in memory only for the scope of the function, and then to allow that memory to be returned to the system. in as efficient a way as possible.   Is there a step beyond making the data local that I should take p

Eventually the API service would be monolithic  containing all the models, but there is a period of developmentmigration where models will need to be shared. brBoth the API and the webapp will be using the same database.p  ul liWhat do I need to consider before jumping into packaging up all my modelsli liWould it be worthwhile to package all the models into a single gem, individually package each model, or do some sort of logical grouping of modelsli liHow would I approach dependencies for gemsli ul  pFor reference, heres a similarish question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5098871sharingmodelsbetweenrailsappsusinggemsSharing models between Rails apps using gemsap  pIm also just getting familiar with packaging Ruby code as a Rubygem. This might explain some of my questions above.p  p[edit] Im using Rails 2.3.14, not Rails 3.X.p
Negative 523 pIve written a little monitoring script in PHP, which should monitor a virtual directory and its active directories. Everything works fine but when the virtual directory service freezes is my ldapconnect not able to connect but also doesnt get an error back. So my whole script stands still. I think that the ldapconnect function gets a timeout back like when you try to ping an IP and its not reachable.p  pThats my connect commandp  precodeconnection  ldapconnecthostname, port or dieCould not connect to hostname codepre  pAnd I havent found something in the manual for ldapconnect a hrefhttpphp.netmanualdefunction.ldapconnect.php relnofollowmanuala about a timelimit parameter in which you could define how long the function should try to connect until it aborts.p  pHow ever I wasnt quite able to come up with a solution with codetrycode and codecatchcode or something like this. I also didnt wanted to use the codesettimelimitcode function because my script needs to be run until the end.p  pI appreciate every help  Thanks and greetings Timp

Negative 523 pAfter investigating a bit at work I noticed that the application Im working on is using the default fetch size which is 10 for Oracle from what I know. The problem is that in the majority of cases the users fetch large amount of data ranging from few thousand to even hundreds of thousands and that the default 10 is really a huge bottleneck.p  pSo the obvious conclusion here would be to make the fetch size larger. At first I was thinking about setting the default to 100 and bumping it to a 1000 for several queries. But then I read on the net that the default is so small to prevent memory issues i.e. when the JVM heap cannot handle so much data, should I be worried about it p  pI havent seen anywhere further explanation to this. Does it mean that a bigger fetch sizes means more overhead while fetching the result set Or do they just mean that with the default I can fetch 10 records and then GC them and fetch another 10 and so on whereas lets say fetching a 10000 all at once would result in an OutOfMemory exception In such case I wouldnt really care as I need all the records in the memory anyway. In the former case where bigger result set means bigger memory overhead I guess I should load test it first.p
Negative 523 pHi guys  I have a builder class, which should only be used once.  For example, there is a setup constructor, and then a to... method which specifies the type of object to be built.  p  pFor examplep  precodeAnimalBuilder a  new AnimalBuildermyTiger  Animal tiger  a.toTiger4 or  Animal dog  a.toDog4   codepre  petc.....p  pHowever, I dont want the Builder to ever be reused, and since it maintains state internally i.e. unlike a factory, builders are two step process.p  pThus, Im currently wrapping each toXXX method by a precondition  that checks a truefalse bit, which records wether or not the Builder has been completed.  If so, then an IllegalStateException is then thrown. p  pemA possible critique of this approach  Why am I using a builder rather than a factory .... Because construction of these objects is much more modularized and easily understood using a twostep builder process  I dont want to copy the generic first step input args into all the specific methods.emp  p1 Is there a simpler way to ensure that a builder class is used only once  Im thinking maybe there is a FactoryBuilder library out there which might make construction of these design patterns with less required boiler plate. p  p2 Is there a better way to implement a twostep object builder design pattern which is evading me at the moment p

Negative 523 pIs there a efficient way to store first name and last name in data structure so that we can lookup using either first or last name I would consider a binary search tree with first name.

Negative 523 pI have a very peculiar problem and my last resort was asking this on StackOverflow, so please be open mindedp  pHere are two programsp  pA. Client A java client running on an Android phone. B. Server A java server running on a Computer.p  pHere is what the two programs dop  pClient sends server coordinates in string format every 2 milliseconds very fast, and the server must read all those coordinates that the client sends it. In order to achieve this given that the server is located at 10.0.0.1 and is listening on port 54321, the server must have a socket via which it reads all the incoming info. And yes, it does receive all of the information, BUT, there is a catchp  pNow that you have the background behind the story, here is the problemp  pThe client connects to the server and as soon as that happens,it starts sending coordinates in string format at an extremely fast rate. The server does get all the messages, but it does not stop reading unless the client has disconnected. What i need is for the server to read every single message individually as they receivedp  pHere is the code i used to read from the socket this is for the server, and it is on its own threadp  precode    whiletrue          try              BufferedReader socketReader               new BufferedReadernew InputStreamReadersocket.getInputStream             String str  socketReader.readLine             System.out.printlnNew Message   str             socketReader.close          catch IOException e              Client disconnected             System.out.printlnClient disconnected.             break               codepre  pThis is the output i am getting from the client where x and y are numbersp  precode New Message x,yx,yx,yx,yx,yx,yx,yx,yx,yx,yx,yx,yx,yx,yx,yx,yx,y...and so on codepre  pAnd that text only shows up AFTER the client has disconnected. I want it to show up AS THE MESSAGES come in.p  pJust to clarify, this is the desired outputp  precode New Message x,y  New Message x,y  New Message x,y  New Message x,y  ... and so on codepre  pIn case this is of any use, here is the method of writing to the socket this code is from the clientp  precodePrintWriter writer  new PrintWritersocket.getOutputStream, true whilerunning      writer  new PrintWritersocket.getOutputStream, true     writer.writex,y     writer.flush  codepre  pSo all in all, what i need is for my server to read the messages as they come in instead of reading them all at the same time after the client disconnects. P.S in C i have also written a server and that one reads the info as it comes in, but in Java this isnt working outp

Negative 523 pI am a beginner in Java . The first thing I learned was the main method of an executable class should be strongpublicstrong and the reason given was since this method will be called by the emJVMem it should be visible outside the class and hence should be public. Now while studying serialization I find that the codewriteObjectcode and codereadObjectcode private methods of a codeSerializablecode class can be called by the JVM while serializing and deserializing an object  If they are private methods then how can JVM call them  If it can then why it cant call the main method p  pAfter flipping through some java documentation , I read this line  JVM can access private methods of an object  . Since we call readObject using an instance of ObjectInputStream so it is accessible to JVM , whereas main method being a static or class method and called without instantiating any object of the class should be public in order to be accessible to JVM  Does that make sense  I dont know .p

Negative 523 pIm a total noob. Over the last three or four months, Ive worked through a dozen books, dozens of online tutorials, and watched hundreds of screencasts teaching myself first Rails along with html, css, etc, Node, JS and my favorite Coffeescript. Ive built lots of toy programs at this point, and Im really itching to get started on my first real project, ie. the startup idea Ive had burning inside me that got me motivated to learn how to do this in the first place. I know at this point that I want to build with Node and Coffeescript. It would be easier, I think, to do it with Rails due to the enormous amount of easy to access information, but Node just makes so much more sense, and it is definitely the direction everything seems to be moving in, and I think that its far more suited to the sort of very dynamic, userinvolved application that I have in mind. Looking at the various frameworks out there, tower most definitely sits the best with me, and just really seems to be doing everything right. p  pThat said, I have a couple of questions actually hundreds, but a couple for now. First, is anyone actually already using tower for production environment, realworld, mission critical development The impression I get is that viatropos already is, but I wasnt 100 sure because of discussions being held in the issues tracker on github. p  pSecond, Ive spent hours upon hours pouring over both the finalized documentation on the towerjs site as well as the wiki on github, and I still feel completely overwhelmed and unsure of where to get started. Tower seems to have so many moving pieces, and I think that really understanding how they all fit together can only come from actually using them, but being able to use them without understanding how they all fit together creates a chickenandegg dilemma that is quite frustrating. Tower has a lot of clear, wellwritten documentation, in fact a deal more than any of the other fullstack Node frameworks out there. But what is missing, at least for someone like me, is a clear starting point.  The perfect thing, in my opinion, would be a nice tutorial that walks someone through the building of the infamous Todos app or far better, something more interesting, explaining each step as you go, so someone like me could take that as a startingpoint for gaining a more gestaltlike comprehension of using the framework, and build something with limited but fullfunctionality, that I could then use to begin creating something with more functionality.p  pHowever, as far as I am aware, nothing like this currently exists and I didnt really expect it to, with tower being such a young framework, so Id like to ask instead for some advice on where to get started. Does anyone have a full, working example of a towerjs app that I could look at in all its glory, play with, and maybe rebuild piecebypiece to try to understand it, or else perhaps a list of steps to get me moving forward with learning it through trialanderror Or an other reccomendations at all p  pI apologize for the longwinded message, and thank everyone for their time in advance. Towerjs is a really cool framework, and I eagerly look forward to seeing how it develops.p

Negative 523 pIm looking for some best practice advice here.  I have a library that Id like to add some debug code into think System.out.println that only gets executed if a flag is set in a configuration file.p  pThis is fairly trivial and will have the desired output for helping debug the program as I go along.  That being said it seems heavy handed in that Ill have a lot of ifDEBUG statements floating around my production code.  Im less worried about the efficiency of the code and more about the readability in terms of the statements that actually do something vs those that are just their for debugging.p  pI understand that with most IDEs I could simply step through the code to effectively give myself a more manual debugging option, but Ive found for any code base that is sufficiently iterative that method is more of a pain than just dumping things to the console.  I suppose another option could be to use a logging framework that has a DEBUG setting, but I still feel like the extra logging instructions would be just as ugly as just shipping them to the console.p  pAre there any options Im missing here  Are their debugging frameworks in Java that make this cleaner  For point of reference Id like to know when some specific methods get called and the string representation of various objects at different points in the execution.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 523 pOur team is working on implementing a codefirst EF framework over an extensive existing database schema. One of the things we would really like to have is a base interface which  all our different entities will implement. All that we intend to define in this basic interface is an strongIdstrong field and a strongNamestrong field since all our database tables have some concept of both of these properties. There are a lot of benefits to this approach because there are a great many cases in our application where all you need from an object is its Id and some descriptive text its Name so being able to program to the interface rather than to the implementation can provide quite a bit of flexibility.p  pThe problem arises because not all the tables in our schema have integerbased PKs, some have strings, guids, etc. So theres no way we can define a true type for the Id field in our interface other than object that can accommodate all the possibilities. The issue then becomes that EF doesnt like the idea of an object as its PK so it complains when trying to specify HasKeyo  o.Id.p  pIs there anyway that you guys can think of to accomplish what we are trying to pull off here  Thanksp

Negative 523 pIm designing an information system in asp.net in witch will be handling different modules once its done.br and i dont have enough time nor money to make all of the modules at once, so Ive decided to do a few modules first and later on when i have time or money continue with the reset of them.  Now the question is is there a generic way to call a module from a list for exampleI would create a directory with modules where im planning to drop the .dll of the modules, so when i make a new one i will put the new .dll there. On the other hand, i want to build something like a skeleton where i will generically call all the modules in the directory Ive made via code, without having to re write the code of the skeleton whenever new modules are dropped into the directory. finally Ive planned that each module should have three layers one for db accessing another one for logic and a the last one for interface drawing so each module should be independent of each other. is it possible how should i do this Ive been looking but cant find anything yet. is there a better way you suggestp
Negative 523 pThis is my first time posting in stackoverflow.  I started learning VB 2010 yesterday though I do know some Ruby and have googled this problem a lot but havent found much.  p  pIve written a program that takes a CSV list of filepaths all .XLS files and attempts to open them.  These excel workbooks were flagged as unreadable by another program my program tries to capture the warning, popup, or exception that caused the error.  It works for most exceptions password protected, Unreadable Content, Dangerous File, etc., but some popups that require you to click the OK button to continue arent caught.  Maybe they arent categorized as Exceptions or something, Id love to know. It would be great to at least get the text form of them.  Here is my scriptp  precodePrivate Sub runReportButtonClickByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As        System.EventArgs Handles runReportButton.Click     Dim Exl As New Excel.Application     Exl.Visible  False     Exl.DisplayAlerts  False      For Each row As DataGridViewRow In dgvReport.Rows         If Not IsNothingrow.Cells0.Value Then             If row.Cells0.Value.ToString.Contains.xls Then                  Try                     Open the workbook and attempt to catch the error                     Use bogus passwords to cause Password Protected Error, Readonly disabled so the Password popup shows.

Even with Excel set to visible and display alerts on, programmatically the file opens and closes without any popups.  One particular warning is the followingp  blockquote   pOne or more worksheets in this workbook have names that contain square brackets[]. To avoid unexpected results when referencing these worksheets, remove any square brackets from their names.p blockquote  pIt doesnt seem like a fatal error, but it causes the other program to flag it as unreadable because we cannot be certain of the integrity of the contents i.e. the unexpected results.  So my need isnt to ignore these popups or improve the other program, its to capture this pesky popup message.  If anyone can shed any light on the duality of this popups behavior or provide a different approach to capturing alerts it would be much appreciatedp

Negative 523 pIs it possible to write an ActiveRecord query that sorts by an association field if the association exists, and otherwise sorts by an attribute on the object itselfp  pstrongExamplestrong I have a codeDiscussioncode object which codehasmany commentscode.

Negative 523 pIm a newbie to both the Entity Framework EF and LINQ. p  pMy questions a little lengthy but really very simple. If I create a query to retrieve data from my RDBMS using LINQ, sayp  precodeusing MyEntities myEntities  new MyEntities       ...     var query  from rec in myEntities.SomeTable                 where rec.Id  someId                 select rec      ...  codepre  pWhen ultimately executed, is this actually converted to SQL and executed on the DB itself wherever that machine is, or are the underlying records actually retrieved onto the host machine first and then filtered by the running app itself using some LINQ andor EF magic. p  pIOW, would all records in SomeTable above be retrieved onto the host machine from the underlying DB and then LINQ andor EF takes care of locating the records with the given someId, or is the above query converted to an actual SQL statement and executed on the DB machine itself which then returns the given records. p  pI would assume its the latter it would be grossly inefficient otherwise but can someone confirm this. Moreover, does this apply no matter how complicated the LINQ query is since it may contain complicated joins, etc., but not including any local functions that may be called in the query of course. p  pIm just trying to understand conceptually whats going on under the hood, and whether LINQ can effectively be used as a highlevel replacement for traditional SQL text queries i.e., LINQ creates the actual SQL queries behind the scenes and sends them off to the DB for execution, but doesnt participate in the actual execution itself, other than handling local function calls in the query, if any.

Negative 523 pSo, here is what I am trying to achieve. I have a server which dynamically generates PDFs based on some parameters users provide on my website. The PDFs can be large 1020MB which poses two problems it is slow for the user and it eats up bandwidth on my server which is running on Amazon Web Services. What I have empirically found however is that most users only look at a few pages of the PDF. So, I want to allow the PDF to be loaded one page at a time and then a user scroll would async request the next page. p  pI realize that I could modify my server code to generate multiple pdfs instead of one, but that is turning out be very time consuming. Hence, I wanted to ask if anybody has ever run into this Maybe there is a way to retrieve the PDF from the server as just binary data and then having some way of displaying the PDF in chunks. p  pI am still in the initial phases of building my website, so I would be open to using any languageframeworktool that can do this.p
Negative 523 pIve been reading Microsofts Prism Documentation and it has a a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarygg40548428vpandp.4029 relnofollowlengthy discussion of the MVVM frameworka. Both the section discussing the Model and the one discussing the ViewModel talk about the View binding to the properties declared in each. Is this correct Everything I read up until this made it seem like the ViewModel was the intended binding source, and the Model was more of the business logic. Any clarification would be appreciated.p

Negative 523 pMy apologies if I cant make the code clearer but I know only some basic HTML and most of what I am doing is hacked from various sources.p  pI run a photoblog at a hrefhttpwww.elcreations.orgengloyphotoblog relnofollowhttpwww.elcreations.orgengloyphotobloga. The original blog was set up quite a while ago in Wordpress. I tried to update the blog recently to make navigation friendlier. One of the things I am trying to do is to display a navigation arrow text overlay whenever the mouse hovers over the image. I have attempted to do this using divs and zindex.p  pThe navigation works very well on Safari, Chrome and Firefox even on a very old and outdated version but fails on IE. I suspect that the reason is that the div to activate the navigation controls are hidden behind the image because of the way IE handles the zindex. I have tried multiple ways to try to correct this including shifting the navigation div around , changing the zindex and position between absolute and relative with no success at all. p  pI realise that my HTML code is not the cleanest I hacked them together anyway and the navigation div is under a mountain of other divs in the hierarchy. I have been trying to figure things out using the Developer tools in Google Chrome to highlight the different divs and inspecting their zindex but have had no success.p  pCan anyone help In the meantime, I have resorted to using conditional ifs in the HTML to generate a text navigation tool for IE in place of the code that works well on nonIE browsers.p  pSee a hrefhttpwww.elcreations.orgengloyphotoblogpaged2 relnofollowhttpwww.elcreations.orgengloyphotoblogpaged2a for an illustration. p  pThanks in advance for your helpp

Negative 523 pI have extended the Android Sample SoftKeyboard example. What this extension entails is to add two vertical AlphabetLinearLayouts extended from LinearLayout above the keyboard, in addition to the LatinKeyBoardView. LatinKeyboardView is a standard keyboard.p  pWhen I remove these two sideviews from my layout, the behaviour is as expected  selecting inside of an EditText pulls up the soft keyboard, and all the views that were onscreen before get shifted upwards.p  pUsually when the keyboard pops up in portrait, whatever content was on screen is moved above the keyboard, effectively pushing some content off the screen to make room for the keyboard.p  pI think that because I have these two extra vertical views as part of my keyboard, the framework tries to push the content up and fails, because the keyboardview takes up too much space.p  pIm trying to figure out how to resolve this issue. The best case scenario would be to somehow get my vertical views to display over the original content, with no further displacement other than whats needed to show the soft keyboard.p  pI construct my KeyboardView as follows p  precodeOverride public View onCreateInputView    RelativeLayout outer  RelativeLayout getLayoutInflater.inflate         R.layout.input, null    Set up keyboard view.   mInputView  LatinKeyboardView outer.findViewByIdR.id.keyboard   mInputView.setOnKeyboardActionListenerthis   mInputView.setKeyboardmQwertyKeyboard    Maintain reference to APC.   mAlphabetViewLeft  AlphabetColumnLayoutouter.findViewByIdR.id.alphabetlistleft   mAlphabetViewRight  AlphabetColumnLayoutouter.findViewByIdR.id.alphabetlistright     Set of references to handle touches.   mAlphabetViewLeft.setTouchResolvermTouchResolver   mAlphabetViewRight.setTouchResolvermTouchResolver    return outer  codepre  pAnd my input.xml file looks like thisp  precodeltRelativeLayout xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid   androidlayoutwidthmatchparent   androidlayoutheightmatchparent xmlnsapphttpschemas.android.comapkrescom.example.android.softkeyboardgt  ltcom.example.android.softkeyboard.AlphabetColumnLayout     androidididalphabetlistleft     androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent     androidlayoutheightwrapcontent     androidlayoutalignParentLefttrue     androidlayoutaboveidkeyboard     androidorientationvertical     appavailablelettersBGHIJKLMNOPUVYgt  ltcom.example.android.softkeyboard.AlphabetColumnLayout     androidididalphabetlistright     androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent     androidlayoutheightwrapcontent     androidlayoutalignParentRighttrue     androidlayoutaboveidkeyboard     androidorientationvertical     appavailablelettersACDEFQRSTWXZgt  ltcom.example.android.softkeyboard.LatinKeyboardView     xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid     androidididkeyboard     androidlayoutalignParentBottomtrue     androidlayoutwidthmatchparent     androidlayoutheightwrapcontentgt  ltRelativeLayoutgt codepre  pFinally, I set up the AlphabetColumnLayouts using the following code.

Negative 523 pI am trying to write my first Android app, and Im having trouble.  I wrote a simple Java program to find the factors of a number provided by the user, and Id like to port it over to Java.  I have an XML file for the interface, which seemed to run OK until I added the first Java class.  Now it wont run, and log.cat says that theres a null pointer exception.  So far, I only have stubs, but it seems like it should run OK with what Ive done to this point.  Im including the log.cat text, but Im too new it this to make much sense out of it.  p  pThere may be more than one problem.  After adding the Java file I began to get runtime errors right away, but I dont think they were null pointer exceptions.  I think that started when I made changes to fix what was already causing problems.p  pAny help is appreciated.  p  pHere is the Java filep  precodeimport android.app.Activity  ltbrgt import android.os.Bundle  ltbrgt import android.widget.Button   ltbrgt import android.widget.EditText  ltbrgt import android.widget.TextView  ltbrgt  public class AndroidFactoringActivity extends Activity        Instance Variables     EditText userNumber     Button factorButton     TextView resultsField     int factorResults       Called when the activity is first created.

So far Ive been using Load Impact and Blitz however they charge a sizable amount of money for the service and are basically a total overkill for what I need. What happens is that at a certain userpersecond rate the server completely dies and I need to debug that. To do that I would need some simple script bash, php, etc that I could install locally, plug usersecond rate into it and have it running for a few minutes while observing what happens on the server. The output should be basic statistics  number of total requests sent and number of successful requests. Does anyone know a good tool for this I though its a good idea to ask before starting to code it myself .p

For awhile I was being good and merging the master branch into my topic branch periodically, but eventually I forgot and now its diverged tremendously. p  pFor example, lets say I have a history likep  pre          qrstuvwxyzmytopic                                abcdefghijklmHEAD                                    123   another topic pre  pIn this case, I would like to just see commits r, s, u, v, x, y, z for example. I dont want to see any changes introduced by the merges. But since the branch diverged from HEAD, I cant just look at the difference between HEAD and my branch. And they diverged to the point that merging them together is a heck of a lot of work just to see the differences. p  pSo is there a way to see the commits made on a given branch that did not originate on another branch or as a result of a merge with another branchp

Negative 523 pWeird thing I saw last night on a PC running Windows 7 Embedded Standard 64bit with 2 monitors connected. The Display Resolution dialog shows the monitors as being display 1 and display 2 from left to right. When I run a program I wrote that used both screens, the output I expected on display 1 showed up on the rightmost display, and the output I expected on display 2 showed up on the leftmost display.p  pSpent some time here and on Google, and ended up using some code I found to create a console app that displayed the contents of the System.Windows.Forms.Screen.AllScreensp  precode For each screen, add the screen properties to a list box. foreach var screen in System.Windows.Forms.Screen.AllScreens      Console.WriteLineDevice Name   screen.DeviceName     Console.WriteLineBounds           screen.Bounds.ToString     Console.WriteLineType           screen.GetType.ToString     Console.WriteLineWorking Area           screen.WorkingArea.ToString     Console.WriteLinePrimary Screen           screen.Primary.ToString  codepre  pRan it on one test machine and got what I expected  AllScreens order matches the DIsplay Resolution dialog order.p  pBut on the problematic machine, the output of the code above came out reversed. DISPLAY1 was at a position that was the second screen rightmost, and DISPLAY2 was positioned at the leftmost screen.p  pThats really weird. Since this WASNT using my program, its something in the innards of .NET. The same code works on other similar machines, so I dont think its a general problem, but is a problem isolated to this machine. Ive tried more searching for similar problems but have come up empty, probably due to the search terms monitor, screen, .NET all match a LOT of items that have nothing to do with this issue.p  pAnyone seen this before, and ideally, have an idea on how to fix it Reinstalling the .NET 4 package did not help. Changing locations in the Display Resolution dialog and then changing them back did not help, even with a reboot in between. p  pThanks.p

The script looks like thisp  precodebinbash  MYSEDoptlocalbingsed  MYSED n XFileName,p  MYSED XFileNamed  MYSED Original Messageq  codepre  pIf I run codecat messagefile  .parser.shcode in my Terminal window, I get a parsed text file. If I do the same using the codesystemcode command in MATLAB, I occasionally get the same parsed text followed by the error messagep  precodecat stdout Broken pipe codepre  pWhen I was using a codesedcode command instead of a codecatcode command, I was getting the same error message. This happens maybe on 1 percent of the files I am parsing, almost always large files where a lot gets deleted after the codeOriginal Messagecode line. I do not get the error when I do not include the last pipe, the one deleting everything after Original Message.p  pI would like to suppress the error message from cat if possible. Ideally, I would like to understand why running the script through MATLAB gives me an error while running it in Terminal does not Since it tends to happen on larger files, I am guessing it has to do with a memory limitation, but broken pipe is such a vague error message that I cant be sure. Any hints on either issue would be much appreciated.p  pI could probably run the script outside of MATLAB and save the processed files, but as some of the files are large I would much rather not duplicate them at this point.p

Negative 523 pMy application works this way  there is a menu with different buttons Category 1, Category 2, etc. and all these buttons open the same activity called ResultListViewActivity, which displays a ListView with content from a database, depending on the button you clicked before.p  pSo there is ONE activity displaying a listview whose content varies. I am trying to add a filter mode for this list view. I have a filter button opening an alertdialog window, this alert dialog has a spinner inside.

Negative 523 pLet me explain this a bit better I need to design a database that needs to be installed in different locations which might or not be connected to each other. p  pMy thought was why dont I use a column in which I put the information about the location site as a key and I have another field that contains the ID of the record For example I need to have a codeCustomerscode table that has a codecustomeridcode and a codesiteidcode column.p  pI know that I cannot create more than one identity columns with autoincrement in a table, though.

I have also a Customer class in the model and customers can have custom rates, modeled by the class CustomerRate. p  pNow on the customer detail page Im trying to display all the possible fees for a customer so the user can pick which rates are custom and which are standards, no bid deal I just create a ViewModel class PossibleFee to model that  p  precodepublic class PossibleFee      public int CustomerId  get set      public int FeeId  get set      public Boolean CustomRate  get set      public decimal CustomerPrice  get set       public virtual Customer Customer  get set      public virtual Fee Fee  get set   codepre  pAnd I added a property to the Customer class to hold the possible fees ICollection PossibleFees, I populate that property in the Controller method public ActionResult Detailsint id  0, an EditorTemplate later, and bam Ive a list of all possible fees for a customer depending on the products they use that the user can edit. p  pNow however on postback, when I hit the Save button, the Default Model Binder does its job and try to populate a ICollection of PossibleFee, and for each PossibleFee try to create a Fee object to populate the property of the same name. p  pOf course it doesnt work since Fee is abstract, the question is rather simpleHow do I tell the DefaultModelBinder to ignore that property on postback, well because I dont need it on postback  p  pI know I could simply recopy the fields I need on the EditorTenplate of PossibleFee in the class PossibleFee, or even remove abstract from Fee.

Negative 523 pIn linqtoentities queries, how spaces be prepended to shorterlength values when querying against an nvarchar columnp  pI seek this capability to facilitate proper sorting of certain fields.p  pstrongHere is my scenariostrong p  pI have database that contains empart numberem columns in virtually every table.  These part number columns are represented as nvarchar20 in the database.  They usually contain a combination of both 6digit and 8digit part numbers.  The vast majority of these part numbers are in fact numeric but some are nonnumeric. Consequently they are represented as strings rather than integers.p  pBecause these part numbers are represented as strings rather than numbers, they do no sort properly.  The 6digit and 8digit values are intermingled rather than separately grouped.  So I want to pad the shorter length values with leading spaces to solve the sorting problem.p  pI do realize that if these columns were stored as emncharem rather than emnvarcharem, I would get this padding automatically.  But changing the data type for these columns is not an option at this point.p  pWhen I craft my own linq queries, I can do sorting properlyp  precodedb.table.Select gt .partNumberColumn.OrderBy gt .Length.ThenBy gt  codepre  pThe problem arises when other tools such as grid automatically compose queries.  Then dont know about the additional sorting requirements.  So it seems like a good solution is to prepend the spaces to the values that are of shorter length.p  pHeres an example query.  When I build the model, rather than merely bringing in the values, I want to prepend 2 spaces to the 6character values.p  precodedb.HubAssembliesWides     .Select gt         new Models.HubAssemblyModel                      HubAssemblyNumber  .HubAssemblyNumber,             DetailedOnNumber  .DetailedOnNumber,             HubMachiningNumber  .HubMachiningNumber,             HubCastingNumber  .HubCastingNumber,             ComponentHubAssemblyNumber  .ComponentHubAssemblyNumber               codepre  pSo instead of p  precodeHubAssemblyNumber  .HubAssemblyNumber codepre  pI wantp  precodeHubAssemblyNumber  .HubAssemblyNumber.Length  6      .HubAssemblyNumber  .HubAssemblyNumber codepre  pCan this be done  Thanksp

Negative 523 pI am trying to take a specific JSON file that is dynamically created on an Android device and send that data using HTTP post requests to a PHP script to store into a text file for later use.

An example of what the format of the JSON file looks is thisp  precodetimestamp 1351181576.64078, name enginespeed, value 714.0 timestamp 1351181576.64578, name vehiclespeed, value 0.0 timestamp 1351181576.6507802, name brakepedalstatus, value true codepre  pThis file is dynamically created line by line on the Android, so I cannot send the whole file at once, but each line as it is created I want to send to the PHP script. I have written a basic Android application that, when a button is pressed, takes a JSONObject and sends it to the PHP script using HTTP Post. Right now I am not worrying about parsing the actual JSON file into objects to be sent, and am just using two test JSONObjects.  The PHP script gets the first object and stores it into the text file no problem, but the other object its keeps reading as null, which I cannot figure out why.

Negative 523 pIm running into the issue where I have a game board laid out on the web page. If this game board is 20x20 squares and the container for it can only fit 10x10, I need the game board inside to be draggable. The user should not be able to drag it outside of the bounds of the container as in the 0,0 tile shouldnt pass the top left of the container, and the 19,19 tile shouldnt go above or the left o the bottom right of the container.p  pjQuery UI has a draggable element that allows me to drag it, but the only constraints I can seem to make are purely related to the container itself. I got around this by setting bounds using the [x1, y1, x2, y2] format instead of a container and that worked for a whileexcept the dragging is slow and does not work well with a scrollable solution.p  pMy issues with a scrollable field without the drag put the scrollbars inside the content and just looks very messy.p  pIs there a good draggable solution that has inertial scroll to the element Is scrolling the only way to go Am I really limited to toggling between one or the otherp  pThanksp
Negative 523 pThere is some code in the project Im working on where a dynamic finder behaves differently in one code branch than it does in another.p  pThis line of code returns all my advertisers there are 8 of them, regardless of which branch Im in.p  precodeAdvertiser.findAllByOwnerownerInstance codepre  pBut when I start adding conditions, things get weird. In branch A, the following code returns all of my advertisersp  precodeAdvertiser.findAllByOwnerownerInstance, [max 25] codepre  pBut in branch B, that code only returns 1 advertiser.p  pIt doesnt seem possible that changes in application code could affect how a dynamic finder works. Am I wrong Is there anything else that might cause this not to workp  pstrongEditstrongp  pIve been asked to post my class definitions. Instead of posting all of it, Im going to post what I think is the important partp  precodestatic mapping       owner fetch join     category fetch join     subcategory fetch join   static fetchMode  [       grades eager,       advertiserKeywords eager,       advertiserConnections eager ] codepre  pThis code was present in branch B but absent from branch A. When I pull it out, things now work as expected.p  pI decided to do some more digging with this code present to see what I could observe. I found something interesting when I used codewithCriteriacode instead of the dynamic finderp  pcodeAdvertiser.withCriteriaowneridEqownerInstance.idcodep  pWhat I found was that this returned thousands of duplicates So I tried using codelistDistinctcodep  pcodeAdviertiser.createCriteria.listDistinctowneridEqownerInstance.idcodep  pNow this returns all 8 of my advertisers with no duplicates. But what if I try to limit the resultsp  precodeAdvertiser.createCriteria.listDistinct     owneridEqownerInstance.id     maxResults 25  codepre  pNow this returns a single result, just like my dynamic finder does. When I cranked codemaxResultscode upto 100K, now I get all 8 of my results.p  pSo whats happening It seems that the joins or the eager fetching or both generated sql that returned thousands of duplicates. Grails dynamic finders must return distinct results by default, so when I wasnt limiting them, I didnt notice anything strange. But once I set a limit, since the records were ordered by ID, the first 25 records would all be duplicate records, meaning that only one distinct record will be returned.p  pAs for the joins and eager fetching, I dont know what problem that code was trying to solve, so I cant say whether or not its necessary the question is, why does having this code in my class generate so many duplicatesp

Negative 523 pI am working on an assignment.  I have the basics down of what I need done, but for some reason, the compareTo is not sorting properly on one set of example inputs.

Negative 523 pWe use a 3rd party JAR which contains an Applet class. When used in an HTML page you pass this applet the name of your application class and an assets .zip file path as parameters, and the applet instantiates and runs your specified class.p  pI need to debug the initialization of our app when started as an applet, but since the applet class is in a JAR, not part of our source I dont know how I can do this... I cant select MyApplet.java and say run as Applet.p  pI really want to be able to launch an actual HTML page with the applet parameters in, with a breakpoint set in Eclipse so it will halt in our applicationclass constructor. Is it possible to tell eclipse to debug an HTML file like this A valid alternative would be to instance the Applet class in a normal Java application manually.p  pThere are other questions about debugging applets, but this seemed a different case since the Applet isnt part of our code.p

Maybe I could try codeparseIntoffsetImg.topcode, but it seems to have nosense here.p  pAfter looking at other questions, Ive seen that probably it is a rendering issue.

The app will be in java, and basically all it does is drawing black and white bars moving very fast from the left to the right of the screen. A bar needs to be very thin something in the order of mm, and very fast it should go from one side to the other of the screen in something like 1 s.

Negative 523 pIn my project, we are supposed to use an SVM based algorithm. So to get a basic idea about implementation of SVM, we are trying to implement an algorithm, which when fed with an array of 1000 integers where first 95 integers are of values ranging from 05, then the next 5 around 10,000 and then again 95 integers of values ranging from 05 and next 5 around 10,000 and so on, will be able to predict the next 100 integers 1001st  1100th with first 95 integers around 05 and the last 5 around 10,000 ... p  pHow to implement it Preferred programming language is python. So are there any svm modules like libsvm which will facilitate this p  pI know this might be a stupid question, but any help would be appreciated a lot  p  pPlease reply  p
Negative 523 pI am writing a program that is based on the Travelling Salesman Problem. There are four cities in which the user determines its x and y coordinates.

Ive also tried to account for if coderoute1code or coderoute6code and coderoute2code or coderoute4code have the same distance.

Negative 523 pThis topic is about simplifying a regex. p  pI have been Client Side validating a form I created using Javascript. This form requires a business to signup using its company name. I have created a regex that seems to work well, but it does have a couple issues. First issue is that the regex only allows companies, whos names are 5 words or less, to be considered valid. I know how I can make it allow more words but that would require more code, which could be considered sloppy work. Is there a way that I can correct the following regex to allow companies to sign up, and not worry about how many words they have in their name Would XSS be an issue with the way I currently have my regex Thanks for all and any help.p  precode ifBname.match[09AZaz]s1[09AZaz][09AZaz][09AZaz] s1[09AZaz]s1[09AZaz][09AZaz]s1[09AZaz]s1[09A Zaz]s1[09AZaz][09AZaz]s1[09AZaz]s1[09AZaz] s1[09AZaz]s1[09AZaz]  codepre

Negative 523 pWere using Dapper and EF in our shop, and Dapper proofed to be extremely helpful in debugging queries in SQL server when something went wrong. Instead of just submitting raw SQL, we created a thin decorator that also adds some context information the origin as an SQL comment, something likep  precode Foo.Bar.GetOrders  SELECT  FROM Order WHERE orderId gt 123 codepre  pThis allows our DBAs and developers to reacy very quickly and find the source of a problem if we have DB calls that are erroneous, or introduce performance hits we have hundreds of thousands of DB calls per day, so one bad query can cause quite some damage.p  pWe would also like to do this with EF. It doesnt have to be an SQL comment, but some kind of hook in order to supply meta information that is submitted with the call. Any idea whether this is possiblep  pThanks for your advicep  pPhilippp

Negative 523 pstrongTLDRstrong What alternatives to the last code sample on this page are there when trying to use relative links on pages included with PHPs codeincludecode commandp  hr  pIm trying to codeincludecode a file that links to a code.csscode document, the problem is that I need to include this file from multiple different directories. My directory structure looks somewhat like thisp  precodewww  getpath.php   css     style.css  php     header.php  content      index.php      posts          index.php codepre  pIm including codeheader.phpcode in both codeindex.phpcode files. codeheader.phpcode is the file that refers to codestyle.csscode which the browser needs to be able to find. Example When using code..cssstyle.csscode, the CSS will show up in my codecontentindex.phpcode but not in my codecontentpostsindex.phpcode, because the browser is looking for codecontentcssindex.phpcode.p  pThe website should also work when placed in a strongsubdirectorystrong of the document root, not in the document root itself. For this reason, I cant just use codecssstyle.csscode relative to the server root to link to my CSS stylesheet.p  pemI thinkem please correct me if Im wrong that the easiest way to tell the browser where to find the CSS document is probably to specify the path strongrelative to the document rootstrong. As I expect my website to be in a strongsubdirectorystrong of the document root and want to avoid using a codeconfigcode file to store the subdirectory in, I need to find out the relative path of the subdirectory the website is in. My idea was to place a file called codegetpath.phpcode in my websites root directory not the document root. In that file, I wrote the followingp  precodeltphp   definePROJECTSUBDIRECTORY, SERVER[PHPSELF] gt codepre  pHowever, I noticed that this gives me the relative directory of the PHP file that the user requested in the browser e.g. codecontentindex.phpcode instead of the included file codegetpath.phpcode. Ive also read that codePHPSELFcode is based on codeREQUESTURIcode, which wouldnt be secure. Ive found this solution a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma23708831717025hereap  precodedefinePROJECTDIR, pregreplace . pregquoteSERVER[DOCUMENTROOT],  . , , DIR codepre  pIt works perfectly fine, but Im wondering if theres a better way to do this. I didnt manage to find a variable for that  is the solution above really the only way to do thatp  pstrongShould I use the previous code example or is there a better waystrongbr Should I change my directory structure How do other people solve this problemp  hr  pstrongEditstrong I have multiple completely independent websites on my webserver, theyre all in subdirectories of the document root like codedocumentrootproject1code, codedocumentrootproject2code, ...br Im trying to get the websites to work in subdirectories. I could obviously send CSS to the browser via codecssstyle.csscode, but that doesnt work if the website is in a subdirectory. I also want to avoid using a config file to specify the path of my project relative to the document root.p  hr  pstrongAnother editstrong The problem is that every php file in my project codedocumentrootproject1code includes a navigation bar by using PHPs codeincludecode function. The navigation bar is saved as codedocumentrootproject1phpheader.phpcode and the css for the navbar as codedocumentrootproject1cssstyle.csscode. When using relative links to tell the browser where codestyle.csscode is, the browser still thinks the path is relative to codeindex.phpcode rather than codeheader.phpcode, so it searches for the CSS in the same directory as codeindex.phpcode.br Problem There are multiple index.php files in different directories, and I dont want to copy amp paste my CSS folder in every single directory that contains a codeindex.phpcode file.p

Negative 523 pMy understanding is that this is a common scenario, but Java doesnt have a baked in solution and Ive been searching on and off for more than a day now. I have tried the CircularCharBuffer from the Ostermiller library, but that uses some sort of reader that constantly waits for new input, so I couldnt get codereadlinecode to detect the end of the content it would just hang.  p  pSo could someone tell me how I could do a conversion For what its worth, Im converting multiple potentially many PDF files to raw text using the PDFBox lib. The PDFBox API puts the content onto a codeWritercode, after which I need to get at the content for further processing so codeBufferedReaderWritercode is not actually essential, but some kind of codeReaderWritercode. I know that this is possible using codeStringReaderWritercode, but Im not sure that this is efficient plus I loose the codereadlinecode method.p

Item is being selected on navigation through list using up and down arrows. When there is a selection change we are calling API to refresh the list again. Because of this user is not able to navigate though other items. p  pI dont think I have explained it completely and it may not make any sense to most of the users. Sorry for that.p  pPlease suggest me if there are already some custom control which can be used to assign dynamic data source or a kind of text box which takes the input and displays the list in combo box style.p

Negative 523 pI have a problem in generating proper time sequence using Rp  precodefivemin lt seqas.POSIXct20140101 00000, as.POSIXct20140401 00000, by5 mins,tzEST time lt data.frameMasterTimefivemin codepre  pUsing above code, I can get a data frame with 25909 observations. However, under Eastern Standard Time without daylight saving, the number of observations should be 25920. The difference is 1 hour from the transition of daylight saving time on 030920014, because then the time would change from 1 AM to 3 AM directly.

Negative 523 pCurrently I am working on Ruby on Rails web application open sourced software. I have encountered problem while reading foreign characters in my table data, both using phpmyadmin and mysql workbench. p  pThe RoR application is using a InnoDB type database.

None of any latin encoding come out. p  pmy machine version is as followingp  ul liphp 5.4, mysql 5.5.36li lirails 2.3.8, ruby 1.8.7li ul  pTried several solutions includingp  ul liptried to add encoding utf8 in development.rb. rake dbcreate without problem, but when using gem install plugins is problematic.

For this I would like to know if we have to change all non utf8, for example latin, binary etc to utf8...in other words making all settings consists of utf8 onlyp  pThe unwanted rubbish characters was some of like this   instead of intended foreign characters. The intended foreign characters are displayed correctly in views web browsers but not in phpmyadmin. p  pI am very new to mysql, phpmyadmin and RoR configurations. Please help.p  pThanks.p  pEdit I also noticed that if I upload the data in the intended characters, it will appears as it is in the database which is what I want to see for the characters.p

Negative 523 pI have a square table with four cameras Xtion pro, one at each angle. Im trying to reconstruct the complete pointcloud of an arbitrary object that is on the table.p  pIve calibrated the cameras. Intrinsic parameters with a chessboard, and estrinsic parameters with a tag like ARToolkit.p  pThe problem is that when I transform the pointclouds from cameras frame to the tagdefined frame I have errors, quite big. p  pHow can I correct this error I tried registration with ICP with poor results. How can I use the obtained transformed cloud as initial guess for a fine registration Any suggestion is appreciatedp  hr  pEdit after D.J.Duff commentp  pIm using Xtion PRO version without the RGB camera. So Im calibrating the IR camera. To do so I covered the IR projector and performed the calibration with the IR stream with the ready to use ROS calibration tool for intrinsic parameters and the a hrefhttpwww.dsi.unive.itbergamascopapersmva2012pitag.pdf relnofollowPiTag tagsa to calibrate extrinsic parameters. p  pI should manually align the cloud with a known object, but can this be automated In sense if I use something like an Lshaped object with no orientation ambiguities, can I automate the registration process to obtain a better transform matrixp
Negative 523 pFor a new project I am thinking about whether to use OpenGL or Unity3d. I have a bit of experience with OpenGL, but I am completely new to Unity. I already read through the Unity documentation and tutorials on the Unity Website.

The position xy coordinates of the obstacle is given by emobstxem and emobstyem.p  pstrongQuestion 1strong How could I do the same with Unityp  pstrongQuestion 2strong In my new project, I will have to draw quite a lot of such geometric primitives.

Negative 523 pI need to process a large number 100 million of requests on a multicore machine each request is to process a row in a data file and involves some IO with a remote system. Although the details do not matter much, the specific task is to load a distributed Hazelcast map from some data files. The execution will be handled through a a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase7docsapijavautilconcurrentThreadPoolExecutor.html relnofollowThreadPoolExecutora. One thread will read the file then submit the data to multiple independent threads to put it in the map. The machine has 32 cores, so there are enough available for parallel loading of the map.p  pBecause of the large number of requests, the common approach of creating tasks and queueing them to the executor service is not feasible as the queued tasks will take up too much memory.p  pWhich brings the a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase7docsapijavautilconcurrentExecutorCompletionService.html relnofollowExecutorCompletionServicea. With it, a task would be submitted when a previous operation completed, which is known by calling codetakecode or codepollcode, as applicable. This will work fine when all the threads of the executor service are used. However, loading up all the threads is not done yet. There are two phasesp  ul lipemfill up the queueem while there are still unused threads in the pool, submit tasks to the ExecutorCompletionService and do not wait until submitting morepli lipemfeed the queueem once the threads are all used, submit a task only once a previous task has finished. Thus, rows will be fed as quickly as possible, but not quicker and will not be queued.pli ul  pThe above can be coded, but I was wondering if the above logic is already implemented and I somehow missed it. Im asking because it looks to be a common scenario.p

Negative 523 pIm not expecting an answer, just thought Id throw this out there...p  pI have an ASP.NET site running on IIS 7.5. Relatively often, maybe 10 of requests, one or two users receive errors while loading javascript resources.p  pOne of the users IE9 recorded the errors in the F12 tools. There are a couple dozen javascript files on our page, and most of them errored out with the followingp  precodeSCRIPT1014 Invalid character xxxxx.js, line 1 character 11 codepre  pAll of the ones that errored give exactly codeline 1 character 11code. Drilling down into the script files in IE through this error message, everything looked fine  the content that IE showed for these files was exactly what it should be.p  pBut these script files, including jQuery, some third party plugins, and some internal scripts, apparently blew up completely when loading. All of our js files are hosted on our servers  no CDNs.p  pHowever, a few of the javascript files apparently were more successful, just erroring out with codejQuery is undefinedcode or similar, telling me those must have at least started to execute properly.p  pCompression is enabled and working properly. I considered the possibility that maybe compression was to blame, and IE was attempting to execute gzipcompressed script without first decompressing it. However, when I force gzip bytes down a response, IE errors with codeline 1 character 1code, and these are consistently codecharacter 11code.p  pIE9 in InPrivate mode works fine  not a single error.p  pSomething that may be related  the browser isnt properly using cached content. When loading the page from my machine also IE9, the codeIfModifiedSincecode and codeIfNoneMatchcode request headers are sent every time on a refresh, which means the response comes back as a 304 every time, and regular navigation always simply uses cache with no requests. On the problem machine, about 13 of the time, the browser requests these files again, with no headers, which means they come back with 200s.p  pI watched Fiddler, and even with that weirdness, all requests and responses are properly formatted and contain good content, so while the caching thing is weird and possibly related, it does not appear to be the direct cause.p  pOf course I tried to reproduce a couple thousand times on my machine, manually and through Fiddler, and everything was always perfect. And the user cant reproduce on demand. So I cant even confirm whether its a server or browser issue, or if its unique to IE or IE9.p  pAny thoughts on what could cause this specific scenario The codeline 1 character 11code thing is what leads me to believe theres some kind of pattern here.p

My reasoning is that even with the triple loop, it is exhaustive over the hash and no more. Each element in hash is basically indexed by a 3tuple, k1, k2, k3. While normally traversing over a 3 deep loop would be On3, I believe that each level of the hash functions as a sparse array, and by that I mean that adding to a hash would not affect other hashes on the same level, or even other hashes on the other levels.p
Negative 523 pI will confess, this question is probably your worst nightmare, but I desperately need assistance.  Any tip, trick, hint or source would be much appreciated.p  pLong story short, the little knowledge I have of jquery isnt getting things done... What I am trying to do is capture the data points within the table see below, store them in an array so that I can reformat the presentation of that data later on during page load. The problem is is that this was written back in the day youll no how far back when you look at the code and so it doesnt have any IDs or classes that are useful to me, which makes it difficult to traverse the DOM.  p  pAny ideas on how I can targetcapture the data points by data points I mean the actual data within each table cell using jquery  Ive tried using .html, .text and .each and sometimes that works, but other times it returns actual HTML of what I am targeting...I cant seem to find a way to get just the data in an organized fashion.p  pAny help you could provide would be much appreciated.p  precode    Removed code due to privacy issues codepre

Negative 523 pI have to take in a video file .mpg or .avi or .mov  ect... using JMF and where the user stops the video or pauses I need to get that frame. If I can get it into a frame buffer then Im golden or even save the frame as a image file like jpg. As once I have the frame I just need to get RGB values from the pixels in the frame.which I already have made a method forp  pMy issue here is I have not got any experience in JMF, but I have a source file that opens a window and then I can browse for a video file which seems to only work half the time.p  pI gather this is a bit of a tall order as I am pretty much in the dark on how to do this, and everything I try looking up is not of any real help, if someone knows a link that has some example code that would be wonderful.p  pThanks.p

Negative 523 h3Displaying h264 video from an mpegts stream over upd on android.h3  pIve been trying for a few days to get this to work with no success.  What I have is a device that produces a h264 video stream that it multicasts over in an mpegts container over raw udp not rtp.  Im trying to get this to display in a custom app on android.p  pI read that androids built in MediaPlayer supports both h264 avc and mpegts, but that it does not handle udp streams, so I cannot use that which would be by far the simplest.  Instead, I have tried to manually parse the mpegts stream into an elementary stream and pass that to a MediaCodec thats been passed the surface of a SurfaceView.  No matter what I seem to try, two things always happen once I fix exceptions, etcp  ul liThe SurfaceView is always black.li liThe MediaCodec always accepts about 69 buffers and then codedequeueInputBuffercode just starts instantly failing returning 1 and I cannot queue anything else.li ul  pI can split the mpeg stream into TS packets and then join their payloads into PES packets.  Ive tried passing full PES packets minus the PES header into MediaCodec.  p  pIve also tried splitting the PES packets into individual NAL units by splitting on codex00x00x01code and passing them individually into the MediaCodec.p  pIve also tried holding off on passing in NAL unit until Ive received the SPS NAL unit and passing that first with codeBUFFERFLAGCODECCONFIGcode.p  pAll of these result in the same thing mentiond above.  I am out of ideas about what to try, so any help would be greatly appreciated.p  pSome points Im still not sure aboutp  ul lipNearly all the examples Ive seen get the MediaFormat from MediaExtractor, which I cant use on the stream.  The few that dont use MediaExtractor explicity set csd0 and csd1 from bytestrings that arent explained.  I read that SPS packet can be put in the buffer instead so thats what I tried.pli lipIm not sure what to pass into presentationTimeUs.  The TS packets have a PCR and the PES packets have a PTS, but I dont know whats expected by the api and how these relate.pli lipIm not sure how the data needs to be passed into MediaCodec is this why it stops giving me buffers.

Negative 523 pI am writing test scripts using Selenium Webdriver and I have created a simple framework for tests stepbystep execution. My goal was to improve the readability of the code as well as the logic of test scenarios. To do that I wrote some wrappers that group some logic together.p  pThe main ideas are as followsp  ol liThe applicationwebpage that is being tested is defined as a class.li liBig chunks of code that define a single logical test step are defined as a method of a class. For example a class codeWebPage1code and possible method is codeLogIncode.li liEach method like described in 2 then is wrapped during the execution phase to handle any possible exceptions that might be raised.li liAdditionally, I have a codewaitForElementcode wrapper function that waits for certain condition on the webpage. If that condition was not met within a predefined period of time, it raises a codeTimeoutExceptioncode which is being handled internally, within the same function.li ol  pSo to give some idea of what I am talking about, please consider the below examplep  precodeclass Applicationobject      def initself         Some code      def waitForElementself, elementName, expectedCondition, searchBy         try             conditions         except TimeoutException             handling      def logInself         code         self.waitForElement...         code   app  Application  initialize an object of class Application   The below chunk of code attempts to complete the logIn test step and if ANY   exceptions are raised during its execution they will be caught by the BaseException try     app.logIn except BaseException as exception     handling codepre  pSo, you can see that the whole step codelogIncode in this case is wrapped inside a codetrycode and there is additional wrapper inside the codewaitForElementcode. p  pNow I want to fail the whole execution if codeTimeoutExceptioncode is raised during codewaitForElementcode and I want to catch it in the outside wrapper the codeBaseExceptioncode. And I still want to handle it locally inside codewaitForElementcode. p  pMy first idea was to to raise an additional exception after the initial one is handled. So I did something like thatp  precodedef waitForElementself, elementName, expectedCondition, searchBy     try         conditions     except TimeoutException         handling      raise SystemException codepre  pSo my 2 questions arep  ol liDoes that approach make sense It doesnt look very clean to me so maybe I miss something Another approach perhapsli liIdeally, I still want to get the same codeTimeoutExceptioncode rather than codeSystemExitcode in the outer exception. If my solution is OK, should I just reraise the codeTimeoutExceptioncodeli ol  pstrongP.S.strong Hope all that iss clear and make sense. Please let me know in the comments if I should refine my description. p

Negative 523 pI just tried using the apache connector provider with jersey client 2.13, but it seems non standard headers I add dont get sent to the server. There is a comment in the docs related to this  but its not very clear what the issue consists in, if this is just a bug in the current implementation or if this is a design issue in the jaxrs spec. Does anyone knowp  pThis is the excerpt from the docsp  pBe aware of using other than default Connector implementation. There is an issue handling HTTP headers in WriterInterceptor or MessageBodyWriter. If you need to change header fields do not use nor ApacheConnectorProvider nor GrizzlyConnectorProvider neither JettyConnectorProvider. The issue for example applies to Jersey Multipart feature that also modifies HTTP headers.p

Negative 523 pI need to program a basic network stack in c, but have some questions regarding proper practices.  Lets assume that I only need to support UDP at L4 and IP at L3.p  pWhen I want to sent a big message that needs to be fragmented.  What is the proper order in which to handle thisp  p1 Initialize the udp header and calculating the checksum over the whole data field plus udp and pseudo header  Then fragment the data field, build the IP header for each fragment, then send out the fragments.p  p2 Fragment the data field, then build a udp header with a different checksum tacked on the front of each fragment.  Then build an IP header to tack in fron of that for each fragment.  Then send our the fragments.p  pMy confusions stems from whether the udp checksum should encompass the entire assembled datagram, or just the individual fragment.  I greatly appreciate any help you can provide.p

It is just a straight forward view with inputfields to register a new company. Also this view gives me feedback when something is not filled in because the properties contain Requiredannotations. On this view I want those properties to be Required.p  pNow in my second view, lets call it AddOrder.cshtml, I want to add an order. And inside this view there are 2 html elements one for the Amountproperty and one codeHtml.DropdownListForcode for the Companyproperty. Dropdownlistfor is filled by ViewBag and it contains previously added Companies from the first view. Now here comes the questionp  pThe dropdownlistfor looks like thisp  pcodeHtml.DropdownlistForx gt x.Company.Id, ViewBag.Companies, nullcodep  pI want to place the SelectedValue from the dropdownlist inside the Company.Idproperty of the Order. But once you post those values to the server the Validation says CompanyName, PostalCode, Street and City is Required.p  pHow can I prevent those [Required]annotation to fire on the second view. I dont want to place the SelectedValue inside a new property codepublic int SelectedCompany  get setcode. Why do I hear you sayp  pWell the Order class is also used in a third view which shows all the details of the Order. I want to be able to show all the Companyvalues on that page. Having only a property with an Id does not allow me to show the fields I want.p  pThanks in advance,p

Negative 523 pIm working on a string class in C using the C standard library.p  pThe class is fairly simple The constructor takes a string and allocates the amount of memory required for it into a char pointers using malloc, the constructor frees it, and if required, it reallocs. The rest is readingwriting functions that dont require more or less memory.p  pOne function I made changes the contents to lower case, puts it in a new object created on the stack and returns it. However, I tried doing something along the lines of emstr  str.toLowerem and needless to say, it failed horribly.p  pEvery other time I launch the exe it crashes. After hours after mindlessly searching, I made message boxes tell me when something is allocated and freed and what it is. Turns out for some reason, it kept allocating and deallocating various items from where ever. Im assuming it was due to a dangling pointer, so I fixed that.p  pHowever, its still allocating and freeing a bunch of things and crashing.p  pHere is the relevant codep  pConstructorDestructorp  precodeStringStringconst char str      data  nullptr      MessageBoxNULL, str, Allocating, MBOK      getSizeOfCharArray does not include the NULL at the end, so add 1     datasize  getSizeOfCharArraystr1     data  charmallocsizeofchardatasize     strcpydata, str   StringString      MessageBoxNULL, data, Freeing, MBOK      if data  nullptr              freedata         data  nullptr       codepre  pLowercase functionp  precodeString StringtoLower      char lower  charmallocsizeofchardatasize     for int i  0 i lt datasize i              lower[i]  tolowerdata[i]          String templower     freelower     return temp  codepre  pMainp  precodeint main      String strString contents      str  str.toLower  This line is what causes everything                              to go wrong.

Negative 523 pIve been trying to switch to Python3. Surprisingly, my difficulty is not with modules or my own code breaking.

My knowledge of Javascript is very basic, based on the stuff Ive come across during the past 4 weeks trying to do some basic code.p  pstrongBackground of the sheet Im working onstrongp  pWe have a large sheet of names with associated info, input onto each row. So 1 row  1 person. Each row goes from Column A to Column T.p  pMy boss would like any historical data kept, very much like a database. Im aware Spreadsheets isnt the best place for this, but my knowledge of database software is less than that of Javascript. What Ive managed to do, as a temporary solution, is create an additional column Column U Archive which cuts and pastes the entire row into a sheet named ARCHIVE when yes is input. It also then deletes the empty row left behind, keeping the table nice and tidy.p  pSee code here sheet name changed to Sheet 1 for example purposesp  precodefunction onEditevent    var ss  SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet   var s  event.source.getActiveSheet   var r  event.source.getActiveRange  ifs.getName  Sheet1 ampamp r.getColumn  21 ampamp r.getValue  yes      var row  r.getRow     var numColumns  s.getLastColumn     var targetSheet  ss.getSheetByNameArchive     var target  targetSheet.getRangetargetSheet.getLastRow  1, 1     s.getRangerow, 1, 1, numColumns.moveTotarget     s.deleteRowrow     codepre  pstrongWhat I would like to do now and what I need the code forstrongp  pMy colleagues would like to be able to view the archive sheet and see, ataglance, which cell was changed. We thought the best and simplest way to do this would be to highlight the cell.p  pHowever, before we archive the row, were having to copy it, insert a line below and paste the copied data. Then we change whichever cell has incorrect data, before archiving the row with the old data so we have a record of all data held at any point during the sheets life. In Column T, before archiving, were also inputting todays date, so we know when the info was changed.p  pSo  I need a code that can change the cell below the one that is being edited this will contain the old data, but not for columns T or U so AS.p  pLike I said before, I apologise for what is likely a cackhanded way of doing things and asking a beginner questionp  pMany thanks in advance.p

Do I need to invoke both the Cycle and Metro threads from a parent processp  pEdit Updated code the issue now is that, instead of actually running in parallel, the Cycle object waits for the timer.ticking method to execute, then performs the actions its supposed to do while Metro is sleeping, then gets stuck waiting for a notify that will never come.  Which means that the threads arent actually executing parallel to oneanother.p

Ive spent weeks trying different methods and the only way I can make work is by using an NSTrackingArea to activate the application and make the window key, send the event to the WebView then switch back to the old application.p  pIve looked through the WebView specifically WebHTMLView which handles the mouse events source code and it appears that due to something to do with scroll bars it flat out wont accept mouse moved events when the window is not key. So, really, this basically seems the only way.p  pThis works. However, there is a delay between when my application becomes active and the other application becomes active again. This creates a bad repeated flickering of the window frame as controls as it changes from the active style to inactive style.p  pThis is from my WebView subclassp  precodevoidawakeFromNib     [[self mainFrame]loadRequest[NSURLRequest requestWithURL [NSURL URLWithString file...]]]     NSTrackingArea trackingArea  [[NSTrackingArea alloc] initWithRect[self bounds] options NSTrackingMouseMoved  NSTrackingActiveAlways ownerself userInfonil]     [self addTrackingAreatrackingArea]     [[self window] makeKeyWindow]   voidmouseMovedNSEvent theEvent     if[NSApp isActive]         NSRunningApplication app  [[NSWorkspace sharedWorkspace] frontmostApplication]         if app  NSApp              oldApp  app                  [NSApp activateIgnoringOtherAppsYES]           [super mouseMovedtheEvent]      ifoldApp         [oldApp activateWithOptionsNSApplicationActivateIgnoringOtherApps]       codepre  pIs there anything I can do to make this switch instant, not draw or, even better, another way to achieve what I wantp
Negative 523 pDuring my programming practice I very often become faced with a problem of data duplication between clientside and serverside scripts.  In this context we can talk about Javascript on cleintside and PHP or C ASP.NET on serverside.p  pLets say, I have a JavaScript code that defines a constant or array, or object with specific data. E.g. it can be data that references to app business rules. This data also should be used at backend and I have to define this constant in appropriate script.p  pAnd in this moment, when we defined the second variable, we have violated the principle Dont repeat yourself. For now, when I change this constant on frontend, I have to change this constant on backend too. p  pAnd amount of coupled in this way data can grow up, and my code will be very hard to maintain in future.p  pSo, my question is next is there any ways, or good practices to follow DRY principles in context of clientserver communication For example, is it good practice to keep this kind of data in .settings files and read it both on frontend and backendp

Negative 523 pI did some research but a little confused as to how to solve this problem. I have a tableview whose cells have a button in it. When the user clicks the button the background of the cell changes. Now I was to save that background color so when the user starts the app up they are the color they selected. I believe the best way to do this is with nsuserdefaults but not 100 sure. If thats  the case do I set up a dictionary for this If someone can steer me in the right direction I would appreciate it.p

Negative 523 pGive credit where its due a hrefhttpnshipster.comjavascriptcore relnofollowhttpnshipster.comjavascriptcoreap  pSo I learned a lot about JavaScriptCore, the only problem that I have right now is that method names get translated to something else. I dont want this to happen. While I understand why this translation has to be done to be compatible with JavaScript way of handling polymorphism, I want to stop this and NOT use any polymorphism in my code. So I wont have a second method and I want my method name to stay as is. I thought of some ways but they dont work very well. I thought, I can use NSBlock, but it doesnt work the way I want.

Negative 523 pIm currently working on a toolbar, composed of a codeUIViewcode enclosing two codeUICollectionViewcodes, with a label sometimes appearing over one of them asking the user for some input.p  pIt looks like this in InterfaceBuilder the upper one is hidden by defaultp  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.com5Nsp3.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com5Nsp3.png altViewap  pThe label is configured using AutoLayout, with a number of lines at 0 and 4 constraints for top, bottom, left and right spacings to nearest neighbour.p  pThen, for some reasons, the label always appear when running the app on an iPhone 6 with iOS 8, and it never shows up on iPads with iOS 7 or 8. p  pIve been checking the frame property of the codeUILabelcode, and for iPhone, it has the correct size, but on iPad, the size is 0,0. Im using a single code.xibcode file with constraints. For now Ive been unable to make it work, be it this way, or with an enclosing view for the upper bar and the label in the latter case, the enclosing view also has a 0,0 size, only the collection view actually has a size and can be visible. Ive also tried to use two code.xibcode files, without success.p  pWhat could cause thisp
Negative 523 pI have an rspec test where I want to ensure that only two values can be passed into my instance variable.

Negative 523 pA tool like a hrefhttpsgithub.comstedolanjq relnofollowjqa turns out to be extremely useful for declaratively extracting and filtering content from a hrefhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiLineDelimitedJSON relnofollowlinedelimited JSONa. However, it appears to require slurping all objects into memory to perform operations such as sorting, and generally it may be useful to exploit existing NIX tools to process one or more fields from the JSON emwhile retaining the original JSON blobs alongsideem.p  pFor example, given a linedelimited JSON from the a hrefhttpsdev.twitter.comstreamingoverview relnofollowTwitter APIa, Id like to sort the tweet JSON blobs by timestamp. This can be achieved by converting the Twitter date format to a hrefhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiISO8601 relnofollowISO8601a for which lexicographic and chronological ordering are identical, prepending the JSON tweet blob with that date, passing the stream through GNU codesortcode, and codecutcodeting to remove the prepended date.p  pWhile it is possible to use codemkfifocode and codepastecode to achieve this, I hoped for a solution that was more concise by utilising codejqcode.p

Negative 523 pIm using the extension Woocommerce composite products to create a product which will have 3 rows groups of products. In each group, there will be several products, from where I want to allow only 23 products to be chosen. The extension allows to choose only 1.

But then Ill have to limit the total quantity selected in a bundle. For example, only 2 or 3 products can be chosen, not all. How can this be achieved p  pPlease note that the extension Mix n Match doesnt work with the Composite Products extension.p  pThanks.p
