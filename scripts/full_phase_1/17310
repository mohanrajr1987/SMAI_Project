Positive 17310 pIve been at this for a few hours now. I am making a small game in C and I am trying to figure out how I can edit variables from inside of a function. I can place the variables in the main and edit them them there no problem, but I cant figure out what I need to do to edit from a function. Below is the function.p  precodevoid HeroSelectstringamp hero      int gold  20, health  5, attack  5, stats[2]   health, attack      string weapon     cout ltlt Please choose your hero.n     cin gtgt hero     if hero  Warrior  hero  warrior              weapon  Broad Sword         cout ltlt You are a Warrior wielding a  ltlt weapon ltlt endl         cout ltlt Good choice.n             ltlt You start out with  ltlt gold ltlt  gold. ltlt endl             ltlt You have  ltlt stats[0]ltlt  health and  ltlt stats[1] ltlt  attack.n      codepre  pAbove is the function definition and I want to be able to edit the health when the player gets attacked or say gets a stronger weapon. Below is the main of the script.p  precodevoid main      double enter, room1, room2, room3, room4, BossRoom     int,   gold  20 This is used as part of check inventory and will be subtracted when necessary     string hero, weapon       Set decimal two places     cout.setfiosfixed     cout.setfiosshowpoint     cout.precision2      Introenter      cout ltlt The first step in this adventure is to choose your hero. You can choose a warrior, a wizard, or an archer.n      HeroSelecthero codepre  pSo lets say he gets a new weapon and it gives 1 attack how do I reflect that in the function Would I create a separate function for this p  pAs the player goes through the game, they can type in stats whenever, and when they do I want it to display their current health and attack and then essentially just loop back to the beginning of the room or fight they are in.p  pI know I can make the changes to the variables if I made all of my loops and all of my ifelse statements in main, but I wanted to try this and keep my main script clean. I did stats as an array, because I think it is good to print the array as a list. Any help would be great. Thanksp

Negative 17310 pI recently began using a hrefhttpwww.eclipse.orgbirtphoenixdeployBIRTa and have developed a report to use with my a hrefhttpdeveloper.mozilla.orgenXULRunnerxulrunnera application.  What I havent yet figured out is how I should deploy the viewer.  It seems like BIRT mostly targets Java applications, so there are instructions for deploying on J2EE, JBoss, and other technologies  with which I am not familiar but Im not developing in Java anyway.p  pReviewing a hrefhttpwww.onjava.compubaonjava20060726deployingbirt.htmlthis articlea on deploying BIRT and reviewing the a hrefhttpwww.eclipse.orgbirtphoenixdeploydeployment detailsa on BIRTs web site, Im not sure where to go.  I wasnt expecting to have to add some large Java dependency for the xulrunner application is there no way I can drop an executable in with my xulrunner app, call it from my app, and pass it a report document  Or something else that would be simpler than learning and using J2EE, JBoss, tomcatp
Negative 17310 pI am currently trying to use NAnt and CruiseControl.NET to manage various aspects of my software development. Currently, NAnt handles just about everything, including replacing environment specific settings eme.g., database connection stringsem based on an input target that I specify on the command line.p  pCruiseControl.NET is used to build the application for the default environment emdevem anytime new code is committed. I also want CruiseControl.NET to invoke a build for my additional environments test and stage, but I do not want these to be automatically invoked every time that a dev build invoked daily as test and stage deployments happen far less frequently. Test and stage deployments only occur when the application is ready for QA.p  pI can easily do this by specifying multiple projects, one for each environment. However, I already have many projects configured, one for each milestone in within my application. If I have to setup 3 projects for each milestone the CruiseControl.NET configuration can get out of hand quickly.p  pstrongHere is my questionstrong Can I parameterize a CruiseControl.NET project configuration such that the parameters are exposed by the web interfacep  pemPreferably I think, I could have checkboxes for each environment e.g., dev, test, stage exposed in the web interface. A build would be made for each environment that is checked, whether the build was forced or automatic. It would be even better if I could default the checked state.emp
Negative 17310 pIve been using a local git repository interacting with my groups CVS repository for several months, now.  Ive made an almost neurotic number of branches, most of which have thankfully merged back into my trunk.  But naming is starting to become an issue.  If I have a task easily named with a simple label, but I accomplish it in three stages which each include their own branch and merge situation, then I can repeat the branch name each time, but that makes the history a little confusing.  If I get more specific in the names, with a separate description for each stage, then the branch names start to get long and unwieldy.p  pI did learn looking through old threads here that I could start naming branches with a  in the name, i.e., topictask, or something like that.  I may start doing that and seeing if it helps keep things better organized.p  pWhat are some best practices for naming git branchesp  pEdit Nobody has actually suggested any naming conventions. I do delete branches when Im done with them.  I just happen to have several around due to management constantly adjusting my priorities.  As an example of why I might need more than one branch on a task, suppose I need to commit the first discrete milestone in the task to the groups CVS repository.  At that point, due to my imperfect interaction with CVS, I would perform that commit and then kill that branch.  Ive seen too much weirdness interacting with CVS if I try to continue to use the same branch at that point.p
Negative 17310 pIm trying to wrap my head around the best way to use IoC within my application for dependency injection, however I have a little issue.p  pI am using a loose implementation of the MVP pattern with a WPF app. Essentially, a presenter class is instantiated, and a view and task e.g. IEmployeeView and IEmployeeTask for EmployeePresenter are injected into the presenter.p  pI would like to use an IoC container Im trying out Unity, though I guess this would also happen with others such as ninject or Structure Map instead of manually injecting these instances, however if the presenter is created or resolved from an IoC container on an async delegate call, or an event thread e.g. not STA threaded then creating a new instance of a WPF window throws the following exceptionp  blockquote   pThe current build operation build key   Build Key[emnamespaceem.Window1, null]   failed The calling thread must be   STA, because many UI components   require this.p blockquote  pNow, I know that new window instances etc need to be STA, however is it possible to use an IoC Container to do the dependency injection even when the UI must be created on an STA threadp  pFrom looking at this problem it would seem that the classtype being resolved is instantiated at the resolve time, not when its registered...p

Negative 17310 pIve been observing some strange behavior with the following codep  precode.fn.submittoremote  function     I use .each instead of the .submit directly so I can save    the submitEnabled variable separately for each form   jQuery.eachthis, function      this.submitfunction        form  this       if form.datasubmitEnabled  false  alertdisabled return false        form.datasubmitEnabled, false       .ajaxtype POST, url url, data data, dataType script,         success functionscript            alertsuccess                       return false          .submittoremote.submittoremote codepre  pSo, basically, upon calling submittoremote on a forms, it will disable its normal submit and then make an AJAX POST request.p  pThe strange thing is that the form gets posted multiple times, as the disabled alert will show. As you can see, Im preventing this by using a variable saved on the form object, and checking that variable to see if the form has already been submitted.p  pUpon further testing, it seems that the culprit is the script returned by the AJAX call. Let me explain a bit what Im doing so its more clear.p  pThe form gets posted to the server, and a script returned. The script shows the form again, but this time with error messages for some fields. Note that the form is completely replaced.p  pThe script, upon showing the new form, executes thisp  precode.submittoremote.submittoremote codepre  pI have to do that because otherwise, when you click on the submit button again, the form is submitted normally, no AJAX.p  pSo, say a user submits the form and its returned back with the appropriate errors the disabled alert is not shown. Then he submits it again this time the disabled alert is shown once. Now he submits it one more time, and this time the alert is shown twice And so on...p  pSo it would seem that the .submit callback is being appended again and again with each request, but whyp  pCould it be that by using .html the original form is kept as a ghost or somethingp  pThanksp  pPS In case its relevant, heres the script returned by the .ajax callp  precodereplacecontentwith  the form and other stuff here .pagecontent.htmlreplacecontentwith .submittoremote.submittoremote codepre

Negative 17310 pI am working on a .NET web application that uses an SQL Server database with approximatly 20 to 30 tables. Most tables will be included in the .NET solution as class. I have written my own data access layer to read the objects from, and write them to the database. The whole thing is consist of just a few classes and very few lines of code en uses generics and reflection to find out what SQL and parameters to use. Now, such thing could be done by using NHibernate or similair framework and some coworkers claim that is foolish of me not to use it. My main argument for not using it is that i want maximum control over my application, know exactly what everything does and how everything works, even if that costs me more development time. I also dont like the fact i have to map my database in XML files my own solution lets me map it in the entity class files.p  pSo, what i would like to hear from you is, is it really stupid to not use NHibernate in this situation Am i really being ignorant or is it not such a strange idea to use my own solutionp

Negative 17310 pI have a jTable and a jButton. When clicked, the buttons actionPerformed method calls another method that contains a while loop and adds a row to the tables model DefaultTableModel each time though the loop. The while loop can run for a few minutes so I want it to show in the GUI the rows being added to the table each time, one by one. However right now it adds all the rows to the table together after the loop is finished, so instead of incrementing the number of rows one by one over the course of a few minutes it goes from a few minutes of showing a table with 0 rows to then instantly having thousands. Ive tried calling updateUI, repaint etc on the table as well as calling fireTabledDataChanged etc on the model but none of this made any difference. Ive also tried using a Swing Timer but to no avail. Id appreciate any help or guidance offered, thanks.p

Negative 17310 pI would like to have a constant set in my class which would be visible for all instances of the class.p  pFirst, I do not know if I need to declare it as static. As far as I understand any changes of a static field done by one of the instances will be seen by other instances so static variable is not bound to a specific instance. Moreover, a static field can be changes without usage of any instance we work directly with the class. So, all these special properties of the static field are related with the way how it can be changed and what be the effect of these changes. But in my case I would like to have a constant so the changes issues are not  relevant here. So, probably I do not need to use static. Rightp  pSecond, my set will contain a lot of elements and I do not want to define the value of the set at once when I create the variable. In other words I would like to declare a set, then add elements to this set step by step. But I cannot do it if I work with constants. Is it possible to specified value of the set and then make it constantp  pThird, I have realized that there can be some problems if I try to change value of variables outside of any method. So, how does it workp  pstrongADDEDstrongp  pOK. Thanks to the answer I understood that it should be final and static since it is a constant set and it will not be associated with any particular instance, it just should be visible to all instances of the class. However I still have a problem. I wanted to specify the set using add and I cannot add to the set if it is constant final. Moreover, I cannot change values of the variables outside methods why. Anyway, I do not insist on the usage of add to define the set. I am ready to define it at once. But I do not know how to do it. I tried things like thatp  precodefinal static Set allowedParameters  new HashSetaaa,bbb final static Set allowedParameters  new HashSet[aaa,bbb] final static Set allowedParameters  new HashSetaaa,bbb final static Set allowedParameters  new HashSetArrays.asListuserName codepre  pAnd they did not work.p  pstrongADDED 2strongp  pCan anybody explain me, pleas, the code given by Tadeusz Kopecp  precodeclass YourClass      private static void fillSetSetltSomeTypegt set           here you add elements, like         set.addnew SomeType          private final static SetltSomeTypegt yourSetField     static          final SetltSomeTypegt tempSet  new HashSetltSomeTypegt         fillSettempSet         yourSetField  Collection.unmodifiableSettempSet       codepre  pbr1.

Id like to be able to link the x and y axes of the imshow plots so that when I zoom in one using the zoom tool provided by the NavigationToolbar, the other zooms to the same coordinates, and when I pan in one, the other pans as well.p  pSubplot methods such as scatter and histogram can be passed kwargs specifying an axes for sharex and sharey, but imshow has no such configuration.p  pI started hacking my way around this by subclassing NavigationToolbar2WxAgg shown below... but there are several problems here. 1 This will link the axes of all plots in a canvas since all Ive done is get rid of the checks for a.inaxes 2 This worked well for panning, but zooming caused all subplots to zoom from the same global point, rather than from the same point in each of their respective axes.p  pCan anyone suggest a workaroundp  pMuch thanks Adamp  precodefrom matplotlib.backends.backendwxagg import NavigationToolbar2WxAgg class MyNavToolbarNavigationToolbar2WxAgg     def initself, canvas, cpfig         NavigationToolbar2WxAgg.initself, canvas       overrided      As mentioned in the code below, the only difference here from overridden      method is that this one doesnt check a.inaxesevent when deciding which      axes to start the pan in...     def presspanself, event         the press mouse button in panzoom mode callback          if event.button  1             self.buttonpressed1         elif  event.button  3             self.buttonpressed3         else             self.buttonpressedNone             return          x, y  event.x, event.y           push the current view to define home if stack is empty         if self.views.empty self.pushcurrent          self.xypress[]         for i, a in enumerateself.canvas.figure.getaxes              only difference from overridden method is that this one doesnt              check a.inaxesevent             if x is not None and y is not None and a.getnavigate                 a.startpanx, y, event.button                 self.xypress.appenda, i                 self.canvas.mpldisconnectself.idDrag                 self.idDragself.canvas.mplconnectmotionnotifyevent, self.dragpan       overrided     def presszoomself, event         the press mouse button in zoom to rect mode callback         if event.button  1             self.buttonpressed1         elif  event.button  3             self.buttonpressed3         else             self.buttonpressedNone             return          x, y  event.x, event.y           push the current view to define home if stack is empty         if self.views.empty self.pushcurrent          self.xypress[]         for i, a in enumerateself.canvas.figure.getaxes              only difference from overridden method is that this one doesnt              check a.inaxesevent              if x is not None and y is not None and a.getnavigate and a.canzoom                 self.xypress.append x, y, a, i, a.viewLim.frozen, a.transData.frozen          self.pressevent codepre

Any messages with the same tag are ordered and handled sequentially in relation to its conversation. Handlers are passed the conversation tag alongside the message, so they may continue the conversation if they require. Something like thisp  precodeConversation c  newconversation sendmessagea, c ... sendmessageb, c ... sendmessagex  handler foo msg, conv     sendmessagez, c  ... registerhandlerfoo, a.type codepre  pa is handled before b, which is handled before z. x can be handled in parallel to a, b and z.

Negative 17310 pSomething just occurred to me earlier today that has got me scratching my head.p  pAny variable of type codeNullableltTgtcode can be assigned to codenullcode. For instancep  precodeint i  null codepre  pAt first I couldnt see how this would be possible without somehow defining an implicit conversion from codeobjectcode to codeNullableltTgtcodep  precodepublic static implicit operator NullableltTgtobject box codepre  pBut the above operator clearly does not exist, as if it did then the following would also have to be legal, at least at compiletime which it isntp  precodeint i  new object codepre  pThen I realized that perhaps the codeNullableltTgtcode type could define an implicit conversion to some arbitrary reference type that can never be instantiated, like thisp  precodepublic abstract class DummyBox      private DummyBox         public struct NullableltTgt where T  struct      public static implicit operator NullableltTgtDummyBox box              if box  null                      return new NullableltTgt                    This should never be possible, as a DummyBox cannot be instantiated.         throw new InvalidCastException       codepre  pHowever, this does not explain what occurred to me next if the codeHasValuecode property is codefalsecode for any codeNullableltTgtcode value, then that value will be boxed as codenullcodep  precodeint i  new int object x  i  Now x is null. codepre  pFurthermore, if codeHasValuecode is codetruecode, emthenem the value will be boxed as a codeTcode rather than a codeTcodep  precodeint i  5 object x  i  Now x is a boxed int, NOT a boxed Nullableltintgt. codepre  pBut emthisem seems to imply that there is a custom implicit conversion from codeNullableltTgtcode to codeobjectcodep  precodepublic static implicit operator objectNullableltTgt value codepre  pThis is clearly not the case as codeobjectcode is a base class for all types, and userdefined implicit conversions tofrom base types are illegal as well they should be.p  pIt seems that codeobject x  icode should box codeicode like any other value type, so that codex.GetTypecode would yield the same result as codetypeofintcode rather than throw a codeNullReferenceExceptioncode.p  pSo I dug around a bit and, sure enough, it turns out this behavior is specific to the codeNullableltTgtcode type, specially defined in both the C and VB.NET specifications, and not reproducible in any userdefined codestructcode C or codeStructurecode VB.NET.p  pHeres why Im still confused.p  pThis particular boxing and unboxing behavior appears to be impossible to implement by hand. It only works because both C and VB.NET give special treatment to the codeNullableltTgtcode type.p  ol lipIsnt it theoretically possible that a different CLIbased language could exist where codeNullableltTgtcode werent given this special treatment And wouldnt the codeNullableltTgtcode type therefore exhibit emdifferent behaviorem in different languagespli lipHow do C and VB.NET emachieveem this behavior Is it supported by the CLR That is, does the CLR allow a type to somehow override the manner in which it is boxed, even though C and VB.NET themselves prohibit itpli lipIs it even empossibleem in C or VB.NET to box a codeNullableltTgtcode as codeobjectcodepli ol

Negative 17310 pHey everyone, this code is meant to read what comes after the hash in the url and display a specific div depending on that value. Right now it works fine, except for when you try changing the hash while youre already on the site or if you hit the back button, which has the same effect changes the hash, but the div isnt changed. The site is made so that it doesnt reload with every div change the main content of the page, so Im assuming the reason the div doesnt change when you hit the back button or type in a different value after the hash is because the page is already loaded, and the javascript code is only called once on page load.

Negative 17310 pMy teacher in an upper level java class on threading said something that I wasnt sure of.p  pHe stated that the following code would not necessarily update the codereadycode variable.  According to him, the two threads dont necessarily share the static variable, specifically in the case when each thread main thread versus ReaderThread is running on its own processor and therefore doesnt share the same registerscacheetc and one CPU wont update the other.p  pEssentially, he said it is possible that codereadycode is updated in the main thread, but NOT in the ReaderThread, so that ReaderThread will loop infinitely. He also claimed it was possible for the program to print 0 or 42.  I understand how 42 could be printed, but not 0.  He mentioned this would be the case when the codenumbercode variable is set to the default value.p  pI thought perhaps it is not guaranteed that the static variable is updated between the threads, but this strikes me as very odd for Java.

Can anyone give pointers as to how i include this in the web application via the web.xml file I have found lots of examples for IIS but i will be using tomcat and apache. p  pI guess the process includes purchasing a certificate and then assocating the web app with the certificate Is that correctp
Negative 17310 pWould it be possible to add text to textboxes with the click of buttonp  pThe page contains three dropdowns category, sub category, items.

Negative 17310 pI have a need for a highperformance string hashing function in python that produces integers with at least strong34strong bits of output 64 bits would make sense, but 32 is too few. There are several other questions like this one on Stack Overflow, but of those every acceptedupvoted answer I could find fell in to one of a few categories, which dont apply for the given reason.p  ul listrongUse the builtin codehashcode function.strong This function, at least on the machine Im developing for with python 2.7, and a 64bit cpu produces an integer that fits within 32 bits  not large enough for my purposes.li listrongUse hashlib.strong hashlib provides cryptographic hash routines, which are emfarem slower than they need to be for noncryptographic purposes. I find this selfevident, but if you require benchmarks and citations to convince you of this fact then I can provide that.li listrongUse the codestring.hashcode function as a prototype to write your own function.strong I suspect this will be the correct way to go, except that this particular functions efficiency lies in its use of the cmul function, which wraps around 32 bits  again, too small for my use Very frustrating, its so close to perfectli ul  pAn ideal solution would have the following properties, in a relative, loose order of importance.p  ol liHave an output range extending at least 34 bits long, likely 64 bits, while preserving emconsistentem avalanche properties over emallem bits. Concatenating 32bit hashes tends to violate the avalanche properties, at least with my dumb examples.li liPortable. Given the same input string on two different machines, I should get the same result both times. These values will be stored in a file for later reuse.li liHighperformance. The faster the better as this function will get called roughly  20 billion times during the execution of the program Im running it is the performancecritical code at the moment. It doesnt need to be written in C, it really just needs to outperform md5 somewhere in the realm of the builtin hash for strings.li liAccept a perturbation whats the better word to use here integer as input to modify the output. I put an example below the list formatting rules wouldnt let me place it nearer. I suppose this isnt 100 necessary since it can be simulated by perturbing the output of the function manually, but having it as input gives me a nice warm feeling.li liWritten entirely in Python. If it absolutely, positively emneedsem to be written in C then I guess that can be done, but Id take a 20 slower function written in python over the faster one in C, just due to project coordination headache of using two different languages. Yes, this is a copout, but this is a wish list here.li ol  pPerturbed hash example, where the hash value is changed drastically by a small integer value np  precodedef perturbhashkey,n     return hashkey,n codepre  pFinally, if youre curious as to what the heck Im doing that I need such a specific hash function, Im doing a complete rewrite of the pybloom module to enhance its performance considerably. I succeeded at that it now runs about 4x faster and uses about 50 of the space but I noticed that sometimes if the filter got large enough it was suddenly spiking in falsepositive rates. I realized it was because the hash function wasnt addressing enough bits. 32 bits can only address 4 billion bits mind you, the filter addresses bits and not bytes and some of the filters Im using for genomic data double that or more hence 34 bit minimum.p  pThanksp

Negative 17310 pImagine I have a abstract FriendEvent model which has several different concrete implementations, ie. FriendPosted, FriendCommented, FriendUploadedPhoto etc. They should all be rendered in my view of FriendEvents, but should be visually distinct from each other e.g. FriendUploadPhoto should include a thumbnail.p  pWhat is a good object oriented pattern to achieve this p  pIm interested to learn if theres an alternative to switching on the concrete class of the model in the view code. That somehow feels wrong because it uses conditional logic where I believe it should be possible to rely on polymorphism, but I have a hard time thinking up a better idea. Are there any established patterns to deal with thisp  pI obviously dont want to implement the view logic in the model, since that would be mixing the responsibilities, and since I may want to have different views for each modelp  pTo clarify How to model the different event type in the model layer is not the problem. There are several well known OO solutions. The question concerns the view code which is responsible for presenting the models visually. I imagine I have an EventView class which deals with showing an event model. The question is How to implement this class without a switch block that selects a different code path depending on the concrete type of Event is is rendering.p

Negative 17310 pWe have a system which is composed of few applications.  Each application at certain points need to generate an event to one of event logs.  Event logs is a table in a database having attributes that define event log number, event type and so on.  All event logs have certain common attributes, but every log has some specific attributes so therell be a sparse table.  Every event log supports its own set of events.  These events dictate which additional fields are to be written.  Application knows event log number and event type it must generate at certain points of execution.p  pIm looking for design patterns which will help us achieve this.  We need to write a library usable by applications, so each developer will have an easy to use classes for the purpose of inserting event data.  Speaking at the code level, I want to reduce client code to call to a single method with a signature specific to event it needs to generate. So far I came up with a Factory most likely itll be also a Singleton which will have 10 methods 10 event logs.  Each method generates an appropriate class say, EventLog1Entry which will provide method for writing data to db.br What to do further I do not know. Any suggestionsp  pP.S. This is my first attempt to use some design pattern, so forgive me if I use professional terms too freely.p

Negative 17310 pHeres a situation that comes up quite often that never sits too easy with me.

Two greps instead of one might not matter here, but in other scenarios, two database or Ajax calls might.p  pI dont particularly like having DemoOptionSpecified do anything more than seeing if the option is supplied. An additional capturing of the value would not be suggested by the method name. p  pI dont particularly like the alternative of having a method called ReadInDemoTimeout returning false if the demo option doesnt exist, as I only want to hear about timeout values if the option is set. DoRealVersion does not care about the timeout value.p  pI dont feel theres a good nocompromise cleancode pattern for this. Thoughtsp

If I get an invalid response from the server, I want to leverage the builtin UI components that Flex has to tell the user something is incorrect about hisher input.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 17310 pIm author of YiiMongoDbSuite the extension that brings MongoDB support in ActiveRecord pattern very similar to SQL one already available in core Yii.p  pMy code became quite popular, as it was written with intention to be almost identical as the original Yii approach to the SQL dbs for shorten the learning curve, the only two main differences is lack of relation support as there is not such thing in mongo and different criteria object.p  pI found that my code is very fun and easy to use, especially for mongo newcomers that was already used Yii, but I also foundthink after few months of developing new features and using my code, that ActiveRecord design pattern is not a good choice for Document oriented DBs and I also think that AR pattern itself is a limiter for mongo true power ie. new Doctrine has abandoned the AR pattern even in SQL dbs.p  pSo my question is what alternative design patterns can be used to unleash the full power of MongoDBDocument oriented DBsp

Negative 17310 pI am currently running a large rails application on a virtual server.  My setup uses Unicorn to serve the Rails App with nginx as the proxy server in front.  p  pOccasionally I get notifications that My CPU usage has pegged for a long amount of time. Then I login and use htop to find the badly behaving process to kill it.  Those misbehaving processes always seem to be unicorn workers. p  pWhat I am wanting to know is, if there is a way to setup monit, or god to monitor these child processes of unicorn and kill them if they hang at high cpu usage for a long period of time.  I know how to monitor the unicorn master process because it writes its process id to a PID file. But it is never the master process, only the child processes the misbehave.p

Negative 17310 pI want to develop an app on android to measure the size of objects in a room. E.g. to measure the length of an edge of a table. For this purpose I would use edge detection either from imagej or from openCV. Then I would take this edge and define the length of a small part of it as a reference. With this part it is perhaps possible to calculate the whole length of the edge. Perhaps the vanishing point can help me with calculations of the length here.p  pAn example of what I roughly mean can be found here at 119 a hrefhttpwww.youtube.comwatchv19zSjggMZ0 relnofollowhttpwww.youtube.comwatchv19zSjggMZ0ap  pThe Questions 1.

Negative 17310 pLong JavaAndroidJNI story short... I have two classes, an objectclass which I created called Packet, and a JNI interface to lowerlevel C code that I wrote.  In one class, I parse incoming packets and store them in an ArrayList. When they are parsed a function Packet.dissect is called, which uses JNI to call lowerlevel Ccode.  This Ccode mallocs some memory, and returns the memory pointer to the Java code which stores it in a private member of the Packet objectp  precodeArrayListltPacketgt scanresults      ...           Loop and read headers and packets         whiletrue              Packet rpkt  new PacketWTAPENCAPIEEE80211WLANRADIOTAP              switchstate               case IDLE                 break              case SCANNING                  rpkt.dissect calls a JNI Ccode function which allocates                  memory malloc and returns the pointer, which is stored in                  a private member of the Packet rpkt.dissectptr.                 rpkt.dissect                 ifrpkt.getFieldwlanmgt.fixed.beaconnull                     scanresults.addrpkt                  break                       codepre  pNow, I want to ensure that this memory is freed so that I do not have a leak.  So, when the garbage collector determines that the Packet object is no longer in use, I rely on finalize to call a JNI Ccode function, passing the pointer, which frees the memoryp  precodeprotected void finalize throws Throwable      try           ifdissectionptr1             dissectCleanupdissectionptr       finally          super.finalize       codepre  pGreat, this works just fine emUNTILem I attempt to share the ArrayList with the second class.  To do so, I use Broadcast in Android by sending a broadcast with the ArrayList list from the first class, to a BroadcastReceiver in the second class.  Here is where it is broadcast from the first classp  precode     Now, send out a broadcast with the results     Intent i  new Intent     i.setActionWIFISCANRESULT     i.putExtrapackets, scanresults     coexisyst.sendBroadcasti codepre  pWhat I emthoughtem was true about doing this, would be that each Packet in the list is passed to the second class by reference to the object.  If this were true, then no matter what the two classes do with the List and the objects in them, I am guaranteed that the garbage collector will only call finalize emONCEem for each Packet when both classes are deemed finished with each packet.  This is super important, or free will be called twice on the same pointer causing a SEGFAULT.p  pThis seems to be happening to me.  Once the second class receives the ArrayList from the broadcast, it parses through it, and holds several Packets from the list.  When doing so, there is another objectclass which has a member of type Packet, if I like the packet, I save it by doingp  precodeotherobject.pkt  pktFromList codepre  pEventually this method which received the Broadcast returns, and some of the Packets were kept.  Finally, when I click a button several seconds later, the ArrayList in the original class is clearedp  precodescanresults.clear codepre  pI have assumed that even when clear is called here, if the first class has kept some of the packets, the garbage collector will not call finalize on them.  The only way for this to be false would be if 1 when the broadcast is sent, the ArrayList is copied and not passed by reference, or 2 when the packets are kept in the second class, the Packet object is copied rather than being kept by reference.p  pWell, one of these is false because free is occasionally called on the same piece of memory twice.  I see that it is allocated new dissection MEMORYADDRESS1  IGNORETHIS, and then two finalize are called trying to deallocate the same memory addressp  precodeINFODriver6036 new dissection 14825864  14825912 ...

INFODriver6036 received pointer to deallocate 14825864 INFODEBUG5946 signal 11 SIGSEGV, fault addr 0000001c codepre  pSo, one of the two assumptions I am making about the objects being passed around is false.  Does anyone know which it might be, and how I can pass the objects more carefully by reference so that I can clean the memory up properlyp  pIf you made it this far through my question and understand it, thank you p

Here a few questions ive been thinking aboutp  ol liIs it bad to have my apikey in the address bar, or in the source.li liSince i am using DjangoPython, should i just create a custom view for each api request and and use simplejson I wanted to use AJAX to reduce the amount of requests, and for better dynamic UI.li liIn these situations, are apikeys, apiurls saved into a session then accessed as neededli ol  pthank you for help and patience in advance,p

Negative 17310 pThis looks very similar to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7614429notificationopensactivitybackbuttonpressedmainactivityisopenedmy previous questiona because its some sort of follow up. I was not very happy with the only solution given also, the solution was for a problem slightly different from this one. So let me try to explain the problem again...p  ol liA notification is created at boot with a codeBroadcastReceivercode.li liMy app main activity is opened and the home button is pressed the activity will be sent to the back stack.li liI pull down the status bar and press on the notification previously created at boot.li liThat will start some activity, different from the main one.li liI press the back button and the main activity is displayed.li ol  pThis is not very different from my previous question... The thing is, main activity was just an example. I could have opened the app main activity and then opened the about activity through a menu option and pressed the home button. The back stack would now be codeMainActivitycode  codeAboutActivitycode. Which means that when the back button is pressed while in some activity started by pressing the notification, we would be brought to the top of the back stack, that is, the about activity.p  pWhat basically want is to prevent any other activity to be opened when I press the back button while in some activity again, started by pressing the notification. I want to be brought exactly where I was, that could be the desktop or some other apps activity, but not my apps codeMainActivitycode nor codeAboutAcitivitycode cause thats not where I was, those were in the back stack, sleeping in the background.p  pI have come up with a solution, but I dont think its very elegant and I was looking for something more, well, elegant...

Negative 17310 pI have some code which sets the html of a div to be the result of a Mustache call against a particular piece of JSONp  precode    function renderbugsjsonfile         .getJSONjsonfile, functionjson           buglist.htmlMustache.tohtmltemplate.html, json codepre  pThe first time the function is called, it is fine. However when I call it with a different jsonfile.

Negative 17310 pI have a website that Ive developed and tested using Firefox 9 exclusively. Im pretty happy with the layoutstyles when viewed in this version of Firefox. Im now facing the unenviable task of making it display equally well or as close as possible in IE7 Im not supporting IE6. Naturally, Id also like it to display well in Chrome amp Safari, but I think they implement the standards reasonably well, so Im not so worried about them.p  pIm using JQuery for JavaScript, which hopefully means I dont have too many differences in JavaScript behaviour, so my chief concern is the CSS. I imagine many others have been down this path, so Im hoping theres a stylesheet available which when conditionally included will fix most common CSS problems seen when viewing a website in IE that has only been tested with Firefox. Does such a thing existp

Negative 17310 pWe have an MVC 3 Razor web project where we specify a custom base class for our views.  In the InitializePage method of this base view class, we are doing some initialization and saving an object to the ViewBag.  This information serves as sort of a model for our layout pages.  One piece of information here a structured context menu that is rendered in the layout pages.  The items on this menu can change, depending on the user that is logged into our site.p  pMy question is how I can unit test this code that runs in the base view class.  Since this code only runs when the view is rendered, do I have any choices other than mocking up a controller context under which to execute the view  Ive seen some samples on the internet about doing that and it seems like its more trouble than its worth.  p  pAny thoughts would be helpful.

Negative 17310 pThere is a website that was created using ColdFusion not sure if this matters or not. I need to interact with this web site. The main things I need to do are navigate to different pages and click buttons.p  pI have come up with two ideas on how to do this. The first is to use the WebBrowser control. With this, I could certainly navigate pages, and click buttons According to a hrefhttpsocial.msdn.microsoft.comForumseucsharplanguagethread20474a993e1144ec815c614a8d3f4b43 relnofollowThisa.p  pThe other way is to interact with the html directly. Not sure exactly how to do this, but I am assuming I could click buttons or use HTML requests to interact with the page.p  pDoes anyone have a recommendation on which way is better Is there a better way that I havent thought ofp

It has a list of MWPrice points OfferPriceMWPairDTO.  I want to render a grid where for hours of a day I can see up to 10 curves curves being the collection of MWPrice points for the day.  I want each of these curve columns to contain a pair of input fields one for price and one for mw value.  I figure, hey, create columns and cells for each, then bring them together in a CompositeCell.  How hard could that bep  pI decided to extend CellTable i.e., ToggleableGrid so that I could encapsulate boilerplate setup, style and behavior as well to set a display mode.  The mode is consulted as columns are being built see isInEditMode to render either a TextCell or a concrete derivative of AbstractInputCell, like TextInputCell.  I also created an extension for SelectionCell i.e., ReferenceDataBackedSelectionCell so that I could set the value of an option using ReferenceData. Single input columns work I can display them as text or as input field or select list.  Its the CompositeCell thats causing me headaches.p  pWhile this code will render pairs of input fields correctly, values are all blank null, either blank text or blank input field pairs.p  pPlease have a gander at the addPriceMwColumn method. Maybe you can see something I dontp

Negative 17310 pIs it possible and how can I listen for changes through the entire DOM tree with jQueryp  pMy specific issue I have a tooltip function that displays the contents of the codetitlecode attribute in a stylish way when you do a codehovercode on any html element. When you do a hover, however, by standard the browser renders the codetitlecode in its own box. I would like to supress that. So what Ive thought of is to move the contents of the codetitlecode attribute to a custom HTML5 codedatatitlecode attribute the first time the page is loaded, and then my tooltip function will work with codedatatitlecode.p  pThe problem is that later on I might add  remove  change the HTML dynamically, so I need to rebind those elements  change those title attrs again. It would be nice if there was an event listener that would listen for such changes for me and rebind the elements automatically.p  pThanksp

Negative 17310 pThis is my first ever post in a forum. Do guide me where necessaryp  pI am trying to set up a template for basic webpage editing using Wordpress and having a lot of trouble with menus. The site is here a hrefhttpmunchkingraphicdesignuat.comdevsite relnofollowhttpmunchkingraphicdesignuat.comdevsiteap  pI managed to eventually set up a CSS only menu 3 level which seemed to work ok, though I did not have control over floats submenus always floated vertical and no matter what I altered I could not get them to float horizontal. Before anyone asks why I was trying to do that it was to test myself and the code to see that it was set up correctly. Didnt quite do this.p  pThen I ignored this and pressed on to see if I could get some effects added to it through jQuery. I initialised jQuery correctly and added some code that I thought would give me a sliding drop down.p  pIt seems to be ok in Chrome  but the 3rd level does not slide and thus falls back on CSS I think. In Internet Explorer 8, there is a flicker when I move to the 2nd level drop down and the 3rd level bounces up and down from zero height to full.p  pI cant even seem to replicate this on my local site. It just doesnt work at all there.p  pCan any kind soul give me any pointers Maybe I am trying to run before I can walk but I fear that I have not even got the basics right with the CSS code.p  pApologies but there is a bit of commented out code also as am trying to learn as I go. Those with NULL after them had this added to get the jquery to kind of work as NULL meant that the html no longer referenced them.p  pHow could this code be better and how can I get good drop downs with jQuery to three levelsp  pMany thanksp  pBelow is the jQuery but the css is also crucial to get rightp  precodeltscript typetextjavascriptgt     jQuerydocument.readyfunction normally loads in noconflickmode, so have to use this line to be able to use the  sign         menubar ul li.hoverfunction             this.addClasshover             ulfirst,this.slideDown400         ,         function             this.removeClasshover             ulfirst,this.slideUp400                  menubar ul li ul lihasul.findafirst.append ampraquo       ltscriptgt codepre  pSo the CSS isp  precodemenubarouter  container box with no colour.

When looking at my app settings after the startup within the device settings, it actually says, that the documents amp data folder contain this 10 MB of data. The app does not need that database anymore when it is once installed, so I just tried to remove the DB from the resource folder, when the copy is done by using the removeItemAtPath. But there seems to be a permission issue with that. brbrp  pHere the code I am using to populate the database at initial startupp  precode Copy the database from the app resource, if it is not already existing in the library path   void copyDatabaseIfNeeded   NSFileManager fileManager  [NSFileManager defaultManager] NSError error  NSArray paths  NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomainsNSLibraryDirectory , NSUserDomainMask, YES NSString documentsDir  [paths objectAtIndex0] NSString dbPath  [documentsDir stringByAppendingPathComponentabiliator.sqlite3]  BOOL success  [fileManager fileExistsAtPathdbPath]   ifsuccess       NSString defaultDBPath  [[[NSBundle mainBundle] resourcePath] stringByAppendingPathComponentabiliator.sqlite3]     success  [fileManager copyItemAtPathdefaultDBPath toPathdbPath erroramperror]      if success          NSLogFailed to create writable database file with message ., error          else          success  [fileManager removeItemAtPathdefaultDBPath erroramperror]         if success              NSLogFailed to remove the source database file with message ., error                     codepre  pAfter researching for hours about that issue, I am actually pretty sure, that I am not doing  ANYTHING wrong at all. The Library path is the location to store updateable files according to Apple documentation. Especially if the data is wanted to be backed up and hidden  not exposed to the user. Both is the case for my app, I want the data to be backed up and I dont want the user to see my database. So Library seems perfectly right. Only thing I could think of is the size of the database in the resource directory. I could reduce that by zipping it. But what are the limits Neither the reviewers nor the documentation could tell me anything specific on that. p  pSo what is actually wrong And if the resource directory is not the right place to store my source database for initial setup, what other directory could I use in my project p  pthanks a lot for any hint.

Negative 17310 pIm getting this error  The operation couldnt be completed. Cocoa error 134140. emem Terminating app due to uncaught exception NSInvalidArgumentException, reason The specified persistent store was not found.p  pI just changed to a new version of my data model. However if I activate the previous version of the data model, then the app works fine. If I activate the new version, I get that error. The only change that I made was that I made all the variables nonoptional in my data model, which should be able to be handled by the automatic migration feature. I dont understand why it says it cannot find the persistent store, when there is no error thrown by [fileManager copyItemAtPathdefaultStorePath toPathmyPathDocs erroramperror].p  pI seem to think this has something to do with the fact that the sqlite file in my main bundle is from the old version of the data model, but there is no sqlite file there that comes from the new version. However, I was under the impression that automatic migration would simply generate a new file for the new model on its own  and migrate the data from the existing file into it. Is this wrongp  pIn my iOS app, I have a file called Formats.sqlite thats in my Resources. At startup after a clean install the app looks to see if theres an existing Formats.sqlite in the apps Documents folder. If theres not, it copies the one from its main bundle into there. This was all working fine before I made the new version of my model. Here is the code I use for thatp  precode NSPersistentStoreCoordinator persistentStoreCoordinator      int count  [[persistentStoreCoordinator persistentStores] count]     if persistentStoreCoordinator  nil ampamp count          return persistentStoreCoordinator          NSArray paths  NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomainsNSDocumentDirectory, NSUserDomainMask, YES     NSString documentsDirectory  [paths objectAtIndex0]     NSString myPathDocs   [documentsDirectory stringByAppendingPathComponentFormats.sqlite]     NSFileManager fileManager  [NSFileManager defaultManager]     NSError error  nil     if [fileManager fileExistsAtPathmyPathDocs]          NSLogSQLite file not found, copying SQLITE file         NSString defaultStorePath  [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResourceFormats ofTypesqlite]         if defaultStorePath              if[fileManager copyItemAtPathdefaultStorePath toPathmyPathDocs erroramperror]                  NSLogError copying file at defaultStorePath to the documents path ,error                                storeURL  [NSURL fileURLWithPathmyPathDocs]     NSDictionary options  [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys                               [NSNumber numberWithBoolYES], NSMigratePersistentStoresAutomaticallyOption,                               [NSNumber numberWithBoolYES], NSInferMappingModelAutomaticallyOption,                               nil]     if persistentStoreCoordinator  nil          persistentStoreCoordinator  [[NSPersistentStoreCoordinator alloc] initWithManagedObjectModel[self managedObjectModel]]          if [persistentStoreCoordinator addPersistentStoreWithTypeNSSQLiteStoreType configurationnil URLstoreURL optionsoptions erroramperror]     my error code here codepre  pSo then the error gets thrown where it says my error code here. What do I do in order to fix this Why is this happening Incidentally the console spits out all the steps for the migration, so it looks like its trying to do it, but then it cant find the persistent store, which I dont understand why it cant find it, since its been added in the build targets. p  pI just want to make sure that if people upgrade from previous versions of the app, their data gets migrated over and they dont have to reenter everything. Thanksp

Negative 17310 pIn my WPF application I have a custom Canvas implementation, in which I draw some text using a specified .ttf file. The ttf file resides in a temporary location that can be deleted at some later point in time. My problem is that once my text has been rendered on the canvas, the ttf file seems to be kept open, and cant be deleted until the application has been closed down.

Negative 17310 pIve obviously missed something somewhere.p  pIn some way a customer has managed to do a booking twice within a 11 seconds delay checked time. My first though was that the user might have done the booking, then backed in the browser and done the booking again. However this is not possible since I had at least 2 validations which I know would prevent this behavior.p  pThe only conclusion left for me is if the customer tried to submit a booking, our webservice somehow froze in maybe 11 seconds, the customer aborted the request and submited again, therefor allowing these 2 bookings to happend at the same moment.p  pApart from that, I got no idea what could cause it. Delay in MySQL insert perhapsp  pSo basicly what I wonder mostly isbr strongWhat can cause a form to get submited and executed twice, with the second one bypassing all required validationstrongp  h2Current workflow of my formh2  pA user submits data in input fields, and then submits them. My system validates all of these inputs and check for both a unique code to make sure that its not used twice through a MySQL call. It also makes sure the number of seats available is equal or greator than then amount of seats booked.p  pIn this mentioned case, both the same code was used and the seats over extended allowed limit.p  pBasicly the booking wont be inserted into MySQL unless the POST is validated.p

Negative 17310 pI am developing a news classification system where a particular news item is assigned to an organization or company name. For instance a news item labelled Apple to launch new iPhone in september 2012 gets categorized in Apple news.  So far, after training the classifier with a bunch of topics such as Apple news, Google news, Microsoft news, Samsung news, Bank of America news etc worked perfect and I was getting almost 99 correctly classified instances from a single trained model. Now the problem is to classify a news such as Samsung and Google prep attack against Apple into three topics, Apple, Samsung and Google. p  pMy question over here is how can I use Mahouts classification to classify a single item into multiple classes. I saw a similar question in this thread a hrefhttpmailarchives.apache.orgmodmboxmahoutuser201206.mbox3C20120607223156.GA26283opus.istwok.net3E relnofollowhttpmailarchives.apache.orgmodmboxmahoutuser201206.mbox3C20120607223156.GA26283opus.istwok.net3Ea.p  pTed Dunning gave an interesting answer as to make seperate category for multiple topics, but in my case the combinations are many. I have to classify news into almost 15,000 companies and realistically speaking any news can be a mixture of any of the 15000 companies. So the making of combinations as a separate category is ruled out. A second suggestion was to arrange topics in a hierarchy which also does not apply over here as the company names doesnt converge to any base category.p  pHaving 15000 models for 15000 topics would do it, but does not sound very plausible toop  pSo what should be the correct way for classifiying multi topic news thenp  pThanks  p

Negative 17310 pI have a view controller that is basically a form with multiple UITextFields and UITextView, embedded in a UIScrollView. When an UITextField becomes first responder, the scroll view automatically move to the focused field, which is believe is the behaviour explained in the first answer in this topic  p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4585718disableuiscrollviewscrollingwhenuitextfieldbecomesfirstresponderDisable UIScrollView scrolling when UITextField becomes first responderap  pThis does not happen when the first responder is an UITextView though, and Im not sure why and how I should fix it.p  pThe second problem is that when the keyboard is shown, the scroll view does not scroll if the UITextView is not in view because its hidden by the newly shown keyboard. I implemented the  code of Apples documentation on how to manage the keyboard  p  pa hrefhttpdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosDOCUMENTATIONStringsTextFontsConceptualTextAndWebiPhoneOSKeyboardManagementKeyboardManagement.html relnofollowhttpdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosDOCUMENTATIONStringsTextFontsConceptualTextAndWebiPhoneOSKeyboardManagementKeyboardManagement.htmla p  pAnd added another activeField variable named activeView for textViews initialized in the beginEditing of TextView, set to nil in endEditing, and scrollToVisible according to its frame when the keyboard is shown. The problem here is that the beginEditing in UITextView is called after the keyboardWasShown, so the activeView is not initialized and thus does not scroll. For some reason, for UITextFields the beginEditing is called before, which is the intended behaviour.p  pHow can I scroll to an UITextView and its the first responder, and how can I move to it when the keyboard is shown and hide it p

Negative 17310 pIve just discovered recently the source of a problem that has been occurring within an application that Ive been working on that uses traditional WinForms MDI with WPF UserControls hosted within ElementHosts for each form. The problem is that if the user changes the text in a TextBox that is TwoWay bound to a ViewModel property that the setter on the property is not set when clicking on the Save button in the toolbar. The consequence of this behavior is that the last text setting that was set is not being saved.p  pIm using the default UpdateSourceTrigger value of LostFocus so I believe what is happening is that the the WPF TextBox element is not loosing focus when I click on the WinForms based Save button in the toolbar. So now that I understand the issue Im curious what the correct or best way is to solve this problem. p  pThe two main options that I can think of either require manual prompting to update the setter without causing the control to loose focus or just make the TextBox loose focus so that the normal source updating occurs.p

Use the CI session id to query the database for the user id in every controller. That way I dont have to place the user id in the session which is a security concern. But this option means an extra db query in every controller 2. Store the user id directly in the session so I have it readily available to query for user info. p  pWhat do you thinkp

Negative 17310 pIm struggling implementing the data structures from my book into formal usable code. Im starting to believe that it is my ignorance in OOP concepts such as inheritance. p  pI understand how data structures such as linked list, trees, and some graphing concepts work conceptually, but even after using and debugging peoples code online. I get lost in the classheader files and the inheritance they used.p  pSo, I was wondering if a strong knowledge of how OOP works is necessary to learn data structures The basics such as constructors and destructor are fairly simple, but concepts such as passing pointer objects into another class object gets wildly confusing.p  pAny input from experience on what helped you the most when learning data structures and what knowledge you felt was necessary when learning it would be helpful.

Negative 17310 pIm currently trying to deploy a sitepackage using Python 2.7 in a project written in C and using SWIG. Everything works very well. Our application is distributed to many clients, and we have one big existential question should our installation package install Python itself lets say in CPython27, or should we include only the python27.dll along with the DLLs and Lib folder of Python, as explained here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1387906cwithpythonembeddingcrashifpythonnotinstalledC with Python embedding crash if Python not installedap  pFor the embedded way of using our sitepackage, I see no problem of not installing Python using its install program from python.org. But for the extended usage, if we take the approach of NOT installing Python on the client machine, I am wondering what will happen if the client installs another thidparty library like numpy. Will numpy work even though Python 2.7 has not been installed properly no registry keys have been set, etc. And if the client wants to use IDLE or PyDev, how can he do that if Python has not been previously installed on its machinep

Negative 17310 pIm using a Debian VPS on DreamHost and wanted to install a featurerich customer issuetracking system not for software development like Bugzilla.  OTRS made my shortlist and I followed the a hrefhttpwiki.otterhub.orgindex.phptitleInstallationonDebian5.04lenny relnofollowInstallation Instructionsa through the Web Server Configuration step etcinit.dapache2 restart, but the restart step reported failure.  Nevertheless pgrep apache showed it was running.  In fact, it turned out that although www.mysiteotrsinstaller.pl was running, my regular website showed a page claiming it had no content but when I looked in the websites folder, its content was fine, just not being served.  p  pDreamHost Support was very helpful, but explained that they dont use the standard Debian Apache server for hosting websites and instead use their own.  Specifically, the Debian server is in etcapache2, but the DreamHost server is in dhapache2.  DreamHost Support determined that the OTRS installation instructions were configuring the usual Debian Apache location which somehow prioritized that server instead of the DreamHost server.   They tried moving the otrs.conf file into dhapache2, but though the regular website was working again, the OTRS page wasnt.p  pHas anybody had success installing OTRS on a DreamHost VPSp

Negative 17310 pI have three common workplaces where I use the codeEclipsecode IDE.p  pA nice trick when using multiple common workplaces is to copy certain configuration files to Dropbox, and link to them in the original configuration location. This way, all settings and changes are instantly available in your other workplaces.p  pYouve got your codeworkspacecode with a whopping 100 megabytes of files. Youve got your code.eclipsecode which is closing in on 200 megabytes.p  pI would like to know which specific files contain my custom javascript code templates, and which contains my keyboard shortcuts, so I can share these, and only these, with myself through Dropbox.p  pIdeally, Id like a list of of certain settings and their locations so I can choose to share more. But I havent found something like this on Google.p  pWhy am I not just sharing my entire workspace and configuration directory Well, first, it is crazy big. Second, Eclipse is modular. In some places I use certain modules that I dont use elsewhere. And you all know that modulesplugins are a crazy mess of files and configuration from which there is no escape.p

I use this command to get graphic g and I know its not correct but I couldnot find the solution Graphic gobj.getGraphicsp  pMorever While creating an Applet we donot create any object which initialise the process.Its automatically calls init.So how to use the variable of applet class.I mean if I create an object for the WhiteBoard Class then will the variables have the same values all the timeno matter how many object I create Eg.Suppose the Applet is working with the drawstatus variable as circle.Now I create an object obj.Does obj.drawStatus is line or circlep  precodepublic class WhiteBoard extends Applet      public static int lastx0public static int lasty0public static String drawStatusline      public void init         setLayoutnew BorderLayout         MainPanel pnew MainPanel         addp,BorderLayout.SOUTH         setBackgroundColor.WHITE         setForegroundColor.BLUE         addMouseListenernew PositionRecorder         addMouseMotionListenernew ObjectDrawer           public void recordint x,int y         lastxx         lastyy          public class ObjectDrawer extends MouseAdapter      WhiteBoard objnew WhiteBoard     int lastxWhiteBoard.lastx     int lastyWhiteBoard.lastyint x,y     String statusWhiteBoard.drawStatus     public void MouseDraggedMouseEvent event         xevent.getX         yevent.getY         Graphics gobj.getGraphics         g.setColorColor.cyan          ifstatus.equalsline             g.drawLinelastx,lasty,x,y                  ifstatus.equalsrectangle              g.drawRectlastx,lasty,xlastx,ylasty                  ifstatus.equalscircle             int rintMath.sqrtMath.powxlastx,2Math.powylasty, 2             g.drawOvallastx,lasty,2r,2r                 codepre  pHere will the gGraphics paint in the applet or somewhere elseAnd is it correct to create an object and use getGraphicsBecause the object which initialise the applet and this obj arent same.I mean only the obj which initialise the applet can change the graphicsp  precodepublic class PositionRecorder extends MouseAdapter      WhiteBoard objnew WhiteBoard     public void mouseEnteredMouseEvent event          requestFocus  Plan ahead for typing         obj.recordevent.getX, event.getY           public void mousePressedMouseEvent event          obj.recordevent.getX, event.getY       codepre  pSorry the question become a bit long and confusing as I couldnot understand what really the problem is.

Negative 17310 pI am developing an application to run as a command line tool, and I am using ScalaAkka. I would like for this command line tool to use a clientserver architecture. When the first instance of this tool is launched, it launches an instance of a server in the background that actually does all of the processing. If a user then opens multiple terminal windows and launches more instances of this app, it will connect to the existing server rather than launch a new one. Basically I need multiple clients talking to a single server. Can this be accomplished with Akkas remoting, or do I need to run a more classic clientserver architecture with a message broker in there somewherep
Negative 17310 pIve written some code to generate .NET types from XML schemas coming out of our CMS.

Negative 17310 pstrongProblemstrongp  pI am trying to redirect from the root folder of a subdomain, e.g. codesub.example.comcode, to a subdirectory of the subdomain and keep the subdomain in the address bar, e.g. codesub.example.comsubdir1code. p  pThis is not the first time that I have used codemodrewritecode, but I am not an expert. I have not used codemodproxycode before, but I believe that it will be required for this task.p  pbr strongBackgroundstrongp  pThis is part of a project that I am working on in which the webhost is private, but the server cannot be modified. I am required to specify all subdomains using their tool, as opposed to creating the rewrites myself. This question pertains to a subdomain being used as a development site, which will eventually go live without being a subdomain, e.g. codesub.example.comcode will become codesub.comcode when it goes live. The reason why I cannot simply set the root folder of the subdomain to the directory that I am redirecting to is that the code base for the project relies heavily on the codeDOCUMENTROOTcode for internal link management, and the target folder, codesub.example.comsubdir1code, is not the root of the site.p  pbr strongWhat I have donestrongp  pemI will start by saying that I have exceeded my allotted time to work on this problem, mainly out of interest.emp  pI have done a lot of research and have tried to pull bits and pieces from the sources that I have looked at. However, all but a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8481005howtoredirectfromasubdomaintoasubfolderusinghtaccessonea of the sources that I have looked at only had information for redirecting from a subdomain to a subdirectory of the sites root, e.g. codesub.example.comcode  codeexample.comrootsubdircode. In fact, the only reason that the aforementioned page did have information related to my question is because the user who asked the question accidentally did what I am currently trying to do. Unfortunately, what he did still is not working for me. Here is what I am trying right now but is giving me a 310  too many redirects error p  precodeRewriteEngine on RewriteCond HTTPHOST sub.example.com RewriteRule  subdir1 [R301,L] codepre  pAs previously stated, I think that I may need to use codemodproxycode for this, but I have no idea what that would look like. p  pbr Any help that you can give would be much appreciated.

Negative 17310 pIm trying to make a simple window that lets me configure a SerialPort based on a default serial Port. Ill show the code below, but first Ill just sum up what it does. I create my Form which initializes everything. I set a default SerialPort to a value, then I showDialog. The PortName, DataBits, and BaudRate all update to the correct default values. The 2 that dont update are the Parity and StopBits. The options in the combo boxes are correct, but the values it is showing are not. When I hit cancel on my form it says that stopbits and presumably parity will say the same thing says that enum value was out of the legal range. but no errors are shown when the form loads. I am stuck on this, can someone please help Ive changed the DefaultSerialPort set method many many times to try different ways of setting the values, but it hasnt changed my outcome. Ive tried SelectedValue, SelectedItem. Ive tried casting the Properties to their enum value type, ive done ToString, all to no avail. So now for code.p  pSo here is my test. The idea is that I am supposed to hit cancel on my form.The Strange nonstandard values are just to show that the different values are updating correctly.p  precode    [Test]     public void

Negative 17310 pCan someone please help me figure out the code for Windows batch file that will look a the properties of executables or installers in a directory, determine the version of the installer and the name of the product, store them in variables, and query agaist installed products in the registry  The idea is that I would like to copy updates to a folder on a machine that has no internet connection from disc.  From there I would like to execute a batch file that looks at the version and name of software, stores them in variables, then queries the registry to see if there is a previous version installed.  So, if I had downloaded installflashplayerax.exe, it should know to look in the registry for adobe flashplayer.

Negative 17310 pstrongSpecsstrong Ubuntu 13.04, Python 3.3.1p  pstrongGeneral Backgroundstrong total beginner to Python p  pstrongQuestionspecific backgroundstrong Im exhausted trying to solve this problem, and Im aware that, besides its instructional value for learning Python, this problem is boring and does not in any way make this world a better place  So Id be even more grateful if you could share some guidance on this exhausting problem. But really dont want to waste your time if you are not interested in this kind of problems. p  pstrongWhat I intended to dostrong  Calculate the number of basic American coins given a value less than 1 dollar. A penny is worth 1 cent, a nickel is worth 5 cents, a dime is worth 10 cents, and a quarter is worth 25 cents. It takes 100 cents to make 1 dollar. So given an amount less than 1 dollar if using floats, convert to integers for this exercise, calculate the number of each type of coin necessary to achieve the amount, maximizing the number of larger denomination coins. For example, given 0.76, or 76 cents, the correct output would be 3 quarters and 1 penny. Output such as 76 pennies and 2 quarters, 2 dimes, 1 nickel, and 1 penny are not acceptable.p  pstrongWhat I was able to come up withstrong p  precodepenny  1 nickel  5 dime  10 quarter  25  i  inputPlease enter an amount no more than 1 dollarin cents  i  inti  if i gt 100     print Please enter an amount equal or less than 100.  elif i gt quarter     quartern  i  quarter     i  i  quarter  quartern     if i gt dime         dimen  i  dime         i  i  dime  dimen         if i gt nickel             nickeln  i  nickel             i  i  nickel  nickeln             if i gt penny                 pennyn  i  penny                 print quartern,quarters,,dimen,dimes,nickeln,nickels,pennyn,pennies         else             if i gt penny                 pennyn  i  penny                 print quartern,quarters,,dimen,dimes,pennyn,pennies     else         if i gt nickel             nickeln  i  nickel             i  i  nickel  nickeln             if i gt penny                 pennyn  i  penny                 print quartern,quarters,,nickeln,nickels,pennyn,pennies         else             if i gt penny                 pennyn  i  penny                 print quartern,quarters,,pennyn,pennies else     if i gt dime         dimen  i  dime         i  i  dime  dimen         if i gt nickel             nickeln  i  nickel             i  i  nickel  nickeln             if i gt penny                 pennyn  i  penny                 print dimen,dimes,nickeln,nickels,pennyn,pennies         else             if i gt penny                 pennyn  i  penny                 print dimen,dimes,pennyn,pennies     else         if i gt nickel             nickeln  i  nickel             i  i  nickel  nickeln             if i gt penny                 pennyn  i  penny                 print nickeln,nickels,pennyn,pennies         else             if i gt penny                 pennyn  i  penny                 print pennyn,pennies codepre  pThis solution, though the best I could come up with, does not work as expected when fed with actual input numbers.

Negative 17310 pI have just compiled vim with python support, which works fine for almost all python based vim plugins like Gundo and YouCompleteMe, except for UltiSnips.

Negative 17310 pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions17195972emacslisptranslatecharacterstostandardasciitranscriptionMy other questiona brought up a related questionp  pIs there a standard table of Unicode to ASCII transcriptions Think for instance of German codecode mapping to codeuecode.p  pUser bobince mentioned in a comment that other languages use the same character in a different way and I fear they may not only use the same glyph but also the same codepoint. Hence mapping e.g.  to u would also be acceptable mapping by visual similarity. So is mapping codecode to codeucode as done by iconv see for instance a hrefhttpergoemacs.orgemacsemacszapgremlins.html relnofollowlink posted by Juanchoa.p  pThe methods shown in a hrefhttpergoemacs.orgemacsemacszapgremlins.html relnofollowthe link posted by Juanchoa are technically working solutions. However, is there a emformal standardem for such a mapping or at least a mapping used as a quasistandard Ideally it would also include for instance phoneticsbased transcriptions for nonlatin characters. I remember that one exists for Japanese kana and greek characters. It shouldnt be a big problem in that regard either. p
Negative 17310 pI have two classes, Parent and Childp  precodeclass Parent      public function parentAction ...   class Child extends Parent      public function childAction ...  codepre  pNow I am testing these with PHPUnit. Im not truly unittesting, but for the purpose of the question, I guess you could assume that I am. I do this with these test classesp  precodeabstract class ParentBaseTest extends PHPUnitFrameworkTestCase      public function testParentAction ...      protected function factoryMethod               return new Parent        class ParentTest extends ParentBaseTest    class ChildTest  extends ParentBaseTest      protected function factoryMethod              return new Child           public function testChildAction ...  codepre  pThe idea behind using inheritance here with the factoryMethod is that without rewriting the tests for Parent, the tests from ParentBaseTest will also be run on Child. In other words, the test is whether Child properly adheres to the Liskov substitution principle. The use of an abstract base class and an empty inheriting class is necessary because PHPUnit doesnt feel like running your base class tests twice otherwise.p  pThe above all works. However, now I want to add a dependency on codetestParentActioncode to codetestChildActioncode i.e. add code depends testParentAction code before the codetestChildActioncode definition.p  pThis does not work. Because PHPUnit doesnt alter the order in which tests are run to satisfy dependencies and runs the tests defined in codeChildTestcode before running the tests it inherited from codeParentTestcode, it will just always cause codetestChildMethodcode to be skipped. p  pIs it possible to force PHPUnit to run the inherited tests first Or is there perhaps another clean way to enforce the dependencyp

Negative 17310 pSo there are tons of examples alike to invoke server methods from client side using jQuery AJAX. Once the HTTP 1.1 connection keeps alive, the client send GET or POST request to receive the data as soon as possible. If connection is not alive, client recreates it and initiate the request. With an additional delay due to connection overhead or errors.p  pIm looking for vice versa technics. In terms of C language  send and recv functions on server side when connection exists. Server sends data by the existing connection to the client or all the clients connected by the time. The client catches data and updatesmodifies its DOM.p  pAny jQuery AJAX example links, thoughts, restrictions or explanations, please.p  pUPD The best option will be the simplest.

I have spent the past few weeks learning C using the web because I had always thought this was The gaming language and had not really thoroughly researched, and am enjoying getting back into this sort of thing greatly. I have since found out to make iOS apps I would need ObjectiveC and Android would be Java I have both devices so ideally would want to program for both.p  ul liAm I wasting my time learning C Should I learn Java or ObjectiveCli liI recently found the Cocos2dx engine which I could use to code in C and be multiplatform. This sounds ideal but it seems that there is a very small amount of tutorialshelpbooks available for this engine.

Negative 17310 pI create models that model complex systems. As agents flow through states in the system, I keep track of various characteristics. Currently, my method is using multidimensional arrays. For example, I report the current state of my agents every month of every year. I also need to keep track of these agents properties. So, I use multidimensional arrays, as followsp  precodeint[][][][][] reporting  new int[NUMYEARS][12][NUMPOSSIBLESIZES][NUMPOSSIBLEEXPERIENCES][MAXAGE]   for Agent a  agents     reporting[currentYear][currentMonth][a.size][a.experience][a.age]       Size, experience, and age are integers  codepre  pAt the end of the simulation, I output all values to an external file.p  pMy problem is thisp  pThese arrays gets highly multidimensional e.g. I add width, numOwners, price, weight, height, and more. I like the specificity this provides, but since Java initializes all those ints when I create the reporting structure.p  pIn a previous post I learned that its best to make the segments with smaller ranges earlier in the array, for example p  precodeint[][] reporting  new int[2][20] codepre  pis better thanp  precodeint[][] reporting  new int[20][2] codepre  pHowever, even with this optimization, I sometimes run out of heap space. Ive found I typically use only 12 of the slots available Any hints on conserving space but keeping the same segmentation depth for my reportingp  pIve considered keeping my writing buffers open, but that doesnt seem wise I usually have five or so of these multidimensional reporting structures, so Id have to keep five BufferedWriters open.p  pThanksp

Negative 17310 pMy issue is that one part displays file directory names and the other parts are supposed to be file counts for certain folders in those directories. right now it is listing the directory names but it is only doing a file count on the first directory and not on any of the others. i do realize that currently the code is for the counts under the In Que table header but if i get this figured out it makes it easier to use for the other categories. p  pbut yes the issue is that i need it to grab file counts from all locations not just the first file path it finds. p  pstrongThis is the codestrongp  precodeltphp    if handle  opendirUsers      blacklist  array., .., somedir, somefile.php     while false  file  readdirhandle        if inarrayfile, blacklist          i  0          dir     Users         files1  scandirdir         x  1         while x lt 4 and i lt 4           x           dir1  Users.files1[x].uploaded            if handle1  opendirdir1              while file1[x]  readdirhandle1  false               if inarrayfile1[x], array., .. ampamp isdirdir1.file1[x]                  i                                      file.n  option gt           lttable border1px styleborderthin cols3gt               ltthgtEmployeeltthgt               ltthgtIn Queltthgt               ltthgtIncompleteltthgt               ltthgtProcessedltthgt               ltphp               echo lttrgt               echo lttdgt               echo filen               echo lttdgt               echo lttdgt.i.lttdgt               echo lttdgt .lttdgt               echo lttdgt .lttdgt               echo lttrgt               echo ltbrgt               gt           lttablegt           ltphp                      integer starts at 0 before counting                 gt   codepre

Negative 17310 pI am using paper.js to create an application in which I can markup an image then save it.p  pMy lowest layer of my paper project is a raster of the image. The next layer up is where vector graphic markup is done using various paper.js items. When an item is committed I copy it to the lower raster layer where it is preserved.

If I capture the raster as an image with toDataURL the child items are not part of the image I wouldnt expect them to be.p  pHow do I insertoverlay part of the rasterized image with an paper.js item I can rasterize the item first, but then I need to know how to merge the two rasters with one overlaying part of the other If I convert to a raster first then pixels that are not in the actual paperjs item but are in the enclosing rectangle will need to be transparent, i.e., not overlay the rasterized image.p

This has been working like, forever. p  precodeDELETE FROM tadVersions WHERE VersionNumber lt dbo.MaxVersioncodDocument4 codepre  pProblem is, eventhough everyday the versions table has this job running in order to discar the oldest entries, the database is reaching an alarming size Currently 300 GB.p  pIn order to reduce said size, someone eventually realized that theres no need to keep versioning pdf elements. So, i was commanded to apply a simple modification p  pthe job will delete older versions of word docs, preserving the latest 5 versions. For any other kind of file, ALL versions except the latest one will be deleted. So, i changed the stored procedure the job is associated to to thisp  precodeDELETE FROM tadVersions WHERE VersionNumber lt dbo.MaxVersioncodDocument4  AND extension  LIKE do  DELETE FROM tadVersions WHERE VersionNumber lt dbo.MaxVersioncodDocument  AND extension  NOT LIKE do codepre  pHowever, after applying the change, the following day the job history notified the following errorp  pThe instance of the SQL Server Database Engine cannot obtain a LOCK resource at this time. Rerun your statement when there are fewer active users. Ask the database administrator to check the lock and memory configuration for this instance, or to check for longrunning transactions.

Negative 17310 pI am trying to generate an export file out of some items, which should conform to some criteria in order to be able to be exported. The thing is the user should select some items by using checkboxes and then click on the ICEFaces strongOutputResourcestrong in order to export hopefully all the selected items.p  pThe parts involved in this process are the followingp  pThe OutputResource in the XHTMLp  precodelticeoutputResource renderednot myBackingBean.emptySelection resourcemyBackingBean.excelResource labelexport to Excel sharedfalse targetself gt codepre  pThe backing bean holding the resourcep  precodeManagedBeanname  myBackingBean ViewScoped WindowDisposed public class MyBackingBean implements Serializable   ...  private ExcelResource resource  ...  codepre  pAnd, finally, the actual resourcep  precode... import com.icesoft.faces.context.Resource ...  public class ExcelResource implements Resource    ...    Override   public InputStream open throws IOException        do some selection here. If there is no valid ticket to export then     this method will return null, otherwise it will return an InputStream     and everything will work properly      if everythingOk              return new ByteArrayInputStream...           hopefully, it wont get to this point     return null    codepre  pAs you can see, Im implementing the codecom.icesoft.faces.context.Resourcecode interface and overriding the codeopencode method to create the Excel export on the fly. p  pNow, once againg, what I want to do is to filter some of the originally selected items and, in case no item is left, navigate to some error page. If this was an codehcommandButtoncode or an codeicecommandLinkcode then I would use the strongactionstrong property to do it, but I cannot do this here because this is an codeiceoutputResourcecode. Is there some workaround for this. Please notice it is not enough to use the strongrenderedstrong property to do this because the user can select something which will immediately render the codeiceoutputResourcecode but the selection should be filtered before exporting it.p  pLast but not least Im using Websphere 8 and ICEFaces 3 to do this.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 17310 pIm currently trying to implement an application to communicate with a machine,  and it should essentially work as followsp  ul liThe program sends a message to the server in this case, the first 255 bytes of a file.li liThe machine responds with a message successfully received or error receiving message response.li liThe program then has to decide whether to send the next message next 255 bytes or not error on the last message, must start over depending on the machines response.li liAnd so on for each message the program needs to send depends on the size of the file.li ul  pSo, we thought of having a thread to do the sending, and another to do the receiving, since we have an api to register a class as the one to receive messages from the machine just by implementing an interface, and the methods to send messages to the machine are not of the blocking type, so a way to wait for the machines response so the program can decide what to do after the response arrives is necessary.p  pSo, we needed to synchronize these two threads somehow, since its possible to determine how many messages they would exchange, which made us try a CyclicBarrier.

Negative 17310 pI use entity framework 5 only for accessing stored procedures, I got my own objects classes already defined. when I import a function from the database the return type is something like SPResults. how can I define the return type as a self made existing class currently to workaround this problem I do the followingbr1 I go to the imported function and choose create new complex type and I give the complex type    the same name as my existing class and visual studio creates a class with the same name.br2 Then to avoid ambiguity I go and delete the class that visual studio created. all the functions works great since my existing classes has matching properties to the columns being retuned from the stored procedures. another side effect is when I update my model from the database to add more functionstored procedures visual studio again creates the classes I deleted at another time before. how do I work by the book and avoid this workaround and the side effectp  pThank you all in advancep
Negative 17310 pIm working on a project that does a substantial amount of pathname manipulation.

Im also curious how other languages like ruby, python and c get around this issue, if they do at all.  If not, this may just be another strike against Windows and I will have to figure out another workaround.p

Negative 17310 pWe have an issue with the theme we created for Liferay and to me it seems like we are doing something wrong, because it seems like a very stupid problem. We use Maven builds for all our plugins and therefore have a build artifact containing a version number. When we deploy the theme, it looks like Liferay creates an ID for the theme based on the theme name specified in the look and feel XML of the theme and the name of the .war file. It looks something like codexxxxWARyyyycode, which is very confusing to me. When we deploy a new version of the theme, Liferay will create a different ID for it and thus all pages using the old theme, will not be updated to the new version.p  pThere has to be some way to  specify a unique ID for a theme that will never change, no matter what file the theme has been deployed as. The file name should not have any meaning for Liferay, in my opinion. Is there some way to do this Obviously we could just always deploy the file with a fixed file name, but somehow it seems to me like we are doing something wrong, missing a configuration setting or something. Is there a way of forcing a unique ID on a themep

Negative 17310 pIm fairly new to Android, so this may be a silly question, its also a little hard to explain so please bare with me. p  pIm about to start building an android app in which I wish to have a nested set of tabs. Lets call the outer layer of the tabs A, B, C amp D and the layer within this 1,2 and 3. 1,2 amp 3 are more like filters that somewhat change the information that is represented in the view, but not the layout in anyway. The layout between A, B, C amp D will change somewhat but again not to drastically. p  pI was initially planning on having a main activity which then when them use four different fragments to represent A, B, C amp D with 1,2 amp 3 within being more like buttons than tabs which will just refresh the view with the relevant information when pressed. However, Im starting to wonder if I should just use one fragment with tabs that are really secret buttons that refresh the view using the same fragment since the view doesnt change that muchp  pI hope Ive explained this well enough, Ive gone over this so many times in my head now that I just need some other opinions. p

Teams seem to choose JSF because it is a J2EE standard without really evaluating whether the programming model suits them. We think JSF is flawed because it tries to abstract away HTML, CSS and HTTP, exactly the reverse of what modern web frameworks do. JSF, like ASP.NET webforms, attempts to create statefulness on top of the stateless protocol HTTP and ends up causing a whole host of problems involving shared serverside state. We are aware of the improvements in JSF 2.0, but think the model is fundamentally broken. We recommend teams use simple frameworks and embrace and understand web technologies including HTTP, HTML and CSS.p blockquote  pAs I understand it, theyre basically saying you can fall into a trap if you wrap a stateless protocol like http with a stateful abstraction. ie that a team can run into trouble wrapping their heads around this. p  pMy question is strongIs there evidence to suggest Thoughtworks assertion that JSF is a broken abstractionstrongp

Negative 17310 pI dont know if theres a way to handle this in angularjs, but I want to be able to dynamically unlinklink a directive.p  pFor example, I have a link which goes to a users profile pagep  precodelta uisrefusersuserid post.user.idgtpost.user.usernameltagt post.text codepre  pWhich correctly creates a link hrefusers5 But if that post is anonymous, then theres no user id for that post, creating a link hrefusers, which is not what I want.p  pThe only solution I was able to find was the followingp  precodeltspan ngifpost.user.idgt     lta uisrefusersuserid post.user.idgtpost.user.usernameltagt post.text ltspangt ltspan ngifpost.user.idgt     lta hrefgtpost.user.usernameltagt post.text ltspangt codepre  pWhich wouldnt be so bad if I werent putting all this nonsense throughout my entire application. Is there a way to create a simple directive that does the followingp  precodelta uisrefuserid post.user.id unlinkuisref post.user.idgtpost.user.usernameltagt post.text codepre  pAnd it would linkunlink uisref depending on the value of post.user.id I could try to create a directive that modifies href, but that would be a mess conflicting with uisref.

Summary If the document is embedded, in order to be persisted it must always have a reference to its parent document.

Negative 17310 pI am working on a project including a small DSL. Lexing and parsing a string in this language results in a parse tree, implemented as an abstract class called Expr, which then has many of the usual derived classes such as AssignmentExpr, InvokeExpr, AdditionExpr, et cetera, corresponding to parse tree nodes which are assignments, function invocations, additions and so forth. The project is implemented in C.p  pI am currently considering the implementation of type inference for this DSL. This means that I would like to be able to take an instance of the Expr class and return something encoding information about the types of the different nodes in the tree. This type information depends on a symbol table types of variables and a function table function signatures. Thus, I would like to do something likep  precodeTypedExpr typedExpr  inferTypesexpr, symbolTable, functionTable codepre  pHere, TypedExpr would ideally be like Expr, except with a Type property giving the type of the expression. This, however, presents the following design problemsp  ol lipIt would make sense for TypedExpr to inherit from Expr and simply implement an additional property, Type. However, this would create two parallel inheritance hierarchies, one for TypedExpr TypedAssignmentExpr, TypedInvokeExpr et cetera and one for Expr AssignmentExpr, InvokeExpr, et cetera. This is inconvenient to maintain, and the problem expands if further extensions of parse trees are required. I am not sure how this can be mitigated. One possibility would be the bridge design pattern, but I dont think this is capable of entirely solving the problem.pli lipAlternatively, Expr could simply implement a Type property, which is then null at the time of construction from the parser, and later filled out by the type inference algorithm. However, passing around objects with null fields invites NullReferenceExceptions. The TypedExpr idea would have mitigated this. Furthermore, given that the idea of the Expr class is to express a parse tree, type information is not really a part of the tree typing is contextsensitive, and requires particular symbol and function tables.pli lipThird, the type inference method could also simply return a Dictionarylt Expr, Type which encodes type information about all nodes. This would mean that Expr remains representative of just the parse tree. The drawback of this is that the dictionary object constructed does not have any obvious properties showing that it is linked specifically to the Expr object passed to the type inference method.pli ol  pI am not entirely satisfied with either of the three solutions given above.p  pMy question is What are the benefits and drawbacks of various approaches to this problem Should type information be encoded directly in the parse tree, or should a parallel tree class be used Or is the Dictionary solution the best Is there an accepted best practice solutionp

Negative 17310 pI have a list of clients page with an add button that pops up a bootstrap modal, allowing the user to enter details of a new client.p  pThe body of the modal is generated by a partial view, which is rendered as part of the list page initially.p  pWhen the user clicks add, the form is submitted to the server via an AJAX call. If there are model errors, then the server will respond by resending just the body of the modal with validation errors, which on the client side is injected back into the modal.p  pIm using codeHtml.ValidationSummarycode and codeHtml.ValidationMessageForcode in the usual way to add the model errors.p  pIf the user now clicks cancel, and then later clicks the add button again, the modal reappears.

Negative 17310 pIn Linux, each thread is given time a time slice of 10ms to execute before the context switches. How is submillisecond latency for network IO possible then  for example, where a UDP packet is sent for a DNS type query and a response is received in less than 0.2 ms I have measured this to occur p  pA sender sends the packet using datagram socket.send and a receiver is running on another thread, and calls socket.receive. Even assuming a non blocking in OS layers, etc. send, when the response does come back it itthe OS, via an interrupt, etc. will have to unblock that waiting thread on socket.receive, and that thread will not get its time slice until the currently executing thread runs out its time slice, which is on the order of 10ms...50x greater than 0.2. Also, the context switch itself takes some significant time, which might be on the order of .1 or so millis. So how are such low latencies achieved p  pI realize one solution might be that multiple coresprocessors are available to instantly run the thread as soon as the response packet is received, but is this the only way I.e. is submillisecond latency possible on a single corep

Negative 17310 pI got a problem with a JAXWS client that tries to invoke a secured service. I have to sign my message with a X509 certificate, which I do using WSS4J.p  pUsing a custom handler I print the signed messaged to file and everything looks good. The message is divided over three lines, because of the two newline characters in the message signature. If I copypaste that message in SoapUI and send it to the server, everything works fine.p  pBut if I send the message directly from the client to the server, I get a SOAPFault that says I dont have a good security header present.p  pI did some extra tests, like setup a mock service using SoapUI, and when I receive the message from my client, everything is in a single line.

Negative 17310 pI have a MySQL temporary table, created from a PHP file, and I need to iterate and reiterate through all of its rows in a double loop, therefore I am using mysqlifetchrow and mysqlidataseek a lot. p  pPerformance is critical so I declared the temporarys table ENGINE to be MEMORY as I dont want  mysqlidataseek or mysqlifetchrow ever to touch hard disc. However, looking at my code I wonder whether the temporary tables ENGINE matters at all, since I simply drop the table immediately after I SELECT  FROM it and then its up to PHP what will happen.p  precodeq  CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE Drk ENGINEMEMORY AS SELECT ... mysqliqueryq DRK  mysqliquerySELECT  FROM Drk mysqliqueryDROP TEMPORARY TABLE IF EXISTS Drk  while ...     some mysqlifetchrowDRK and mysqlidataseekDRK, i calls here   while ...          more of mysqlifetchrowDRK and mysqlidataseekDRK, j calls here     codepre  pSo my question is basic what is actually happening behind the scene Where is the result of SELECT  FROM stored and how to force it to stay in memory Even better, Id like to directly access and iterate through the rows of my temporary memory table, without ever calling that SELECT  FROM Drk that, superficially looking, seems redundant and copied everything once again.p

Negative 17310 pLets suppose a web page located at codeitemscode, listing all the available items.br When the user clicks on one item, the browser shows codeitemsitemIdcode and present the items details.p  pOf course, the items list could be very large.br Thats why Im using the a hrefhttpionicframework.comdocsapidirectiveionInfiniteScroll relnofollowscroll infinite feature from Ionica Framework Im using based on Angular.p  pHowever, as many developers know, handling the back button from codeitemsitemIdcode to codeitemscode is tricky since the Angulars controller is destroyed during the page transition and then rebuilt when the list page is loaded again.br Therefore losing the scroll position and the exact items already loaded before clicking on an items detail.p  pI think about some solutions, but I hesitate since all have a drawback p  ul lipStoring the actual loaded items the complete items in codecacheFactorycode Angulars cache or localStorage just before the item details is about to be shown.br Thus, when the back button is pressed on the detail page, the codeitemscodes controller can init the data from the cache, and besides the scroll position could then be easily remembered.br Drawback is that the data in cache may be stale...pli lipNo need to store any loaded items in cache Just store in cache or localStorage the actual number of chunks loaded.br For instance, my REST API allows to retrieve items 10 by 10.br If the users was loaded up to the second chunk up to 20 elements so, a variable in cache would contain this value and the controller could then be init with all the 20 items initially.br Drawback is that it would involve several requests to server. Indeed, if the user loaded 30 chunks, the controller would need to make 30 calls to server... I could customize the size of chunk processed by the server, but one item is heavy several long texts etc.. lists of anything, explaining why I limited to a relatively small number. pli lipUsing a bidirectional scrolling top and bottom, so that theres ALWAYS 10 items in the DOM.      I would just need to store the last number of chunk already loaded, in order to reload it.br Drawback I would have to write my directive myself possible so since theres no Angular neither from Ionic directive currently.br And I imagine that bidirectional is useful only when dealing with very very large list more than 2000 rows, in order to lighten the DOM.br I dont expect more than 400 rows in a majority of my cases... pli ul  pWhat is a good practice Maybe another solution  p

Negative 17310 pstrongBackgroundstrong img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comh7gcl.png altMid sized examplep  pSo I have a few hundred elements image is a simple case that I need to constantly resort since their sorting value changes whenever the elements X or Y value changes. A normal absolute sort is not possible since many elements have an undefined relation to each other like the purple and orange block that would just break a mergequickbubblesort. However, changing a single element can potentially change many ordering relationships if that element had an edge to many others like if the green block were removedp  pI understand the idea behind building a tree and doing a topological sort but this seems horribly inefficient to do all the time because of a single element changing.p  pIf the above is still unclear, check out a hrefhttpshaunlebron.comIsometricBlocks relnofollowhttpshaunlebron.comIsometricBlocksa since that is fairly similar to what I am trying to do.p  pstrongMy questionstrong I cant help but think that a tree is not necessary at least for my case but that a linked list would be fine, since my case guarantees that there will never be a cycle. emWouldnt it be sufficient with ascending order to just always place an element after the last element that it is greater than, but before the first element that it is less thanem Wouldnt this effectively allow sorting of a partially ordered setp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comyydNj.png altOne valid absolute ordering of the elementsp  pIs there some case that prevents a person from just skipping the tree step and going straight to a list Every simulation Ive done on paper seems to suggest that this would work.p
Negative 17310 pI have a Kinect sensor connected to a PC and my application that is requesting frames over a TCP connection that is residing on another PC.

Negative 17310 pThere are numerous suggestions around the web that Cassandra is not a good choice when it comes to persistent scalable queues, including this one from DataStax a hrefhttpwww.datastax.comdevblogcassandraantipatternsqueuesandqueuelikedatasets relnofollowhttpwww.datastax.comdevblogcassandraantipatternsqueuesandqueuelikedatasetsap  pYet very few places mention an alternative. And I think I might need one.p  pSpecifically my scenario is There are tasks lets say 100 millions of them that need to be executed at some point in the future. Each task has therefore an associated runAt property and tasks need to run at their runAt time passes but small delays are allowed. As tasks complete they need to be removed from the queue. At the same time new tasks are added to the queue at some arbitrary rate lets say 100ssec or more with arbitrary runAt values between now and 1 year from now.p  pA possible implementation would make use of Cassandras ability to order the columns within a row and use some variant of the readdelete technique that is read the top of the queue, execute the tasks and remove them from the queue, which closely resembles the mentioned antipattern. p  pSo what would make most sense Try tuning the suggested workarounds to the point that would make this particular problem work at the expected scale Or a completely different piece of technology would be more suitable for the jobp  pAny helpadvice would be appreciated.p

Negative 17310 pAny help would be greatly appreciated please. p  pI have a page full of drawers which operate like an accordion. Couldnt use Jquery UI accordion for various reasons. So instead im using Animated Collapse 2.4 from dynamic drive. Each of the drawer divs contain unique forms. On those forms I am using Jquery Validator and tooltipster to display the validation errors. p  pThe problem I have is that when a draw is closed before validation success, the tooltipsters dont disappear completely they hang around where the form was, and if you scroll the page or move around at all they jump to the top left hand side of the screen half shown So they sort of hide but dont fully. Its as if they need positioning just a few more dozen pixels up and left.p  pBecause I have multiple div drawers containing forms, sometimes its necessary to switch to another drawer when completing one particular draws form to reference other data. So sometimes I need users to be able to close a drawer without fully completing each form and come back to it later. p  pAny ideas please p  pYou need to include the js scripts from Dynamic Drive for the animatedcollapse.js  available at a hrefhttpwww.dynamicdrive.comdynamicindex17animatedcollapse.htm relnofollowLinkap  pAlso you need to include the jquery.tooltipster.js and css files which can be

Negative 17310 pI have been reading for days now trying to find a way to resolve tree conflicts using tortiseSVN 1.8.  I have two branch off of trunkp  ul libranches3.1li libranches3.2li ul  pAgain, both of these branches were off of trunk. We do not do mainline development on trunk.  Im trying to merge the changes from our 3.1 branch to our 3.2 branch.p  pThe code in 3.1 went through some refactoring and a lot of folders that exist in the 3.2 branch no longer exist in the 3.1 branch. Also, there is some new work adding new folder to 3.2.  The problem is that a tree conflict does not give me a way to resolve the conflicts, but only allows me to accept the working copy.  This seems like a serious flaw.  We are doing a lot of refactoring and Im looking for a process that we can integrate changes on an earlier release branch into a later release branch.p  pCan somebody tell me the best way to handle thisp
Negative 17310 pWhen a codeUITextFieldcode is added to a codeUIScrollviewcode the scroll view automatically adjusts its codecontentOffsetcode so that the view will not be obscured by the keyboard.p  pI have a custom codeUIControlcode which also presents a keyboard when it becomes the first responder by assigning its codeinputViewcode property. The same scrolling behavior does not work. Is there a way to configure a codeUIControlcode such that  a scroll view will keep it visible when the keyboard is presentedp  pMy guess is that it could be possible by overriding a property defined in one of the protocols codeUITextFieldcode and other classes which this behavior conform to. But these can be a bit of a maze. Also note, the issue here has nothing to do with the scroll views codecontentInsetcode property. The scroll view emcanem scroll to show the custom control, it just doesnt do it automatically when the control becomes the first responder. p

Negative 17310 pIm fairly new to MYSQL but I have experience programming in VBA.  Im trying to create a stored procedure which will backtest a strategy against a table of historical stock price data.The procedure will calculate the 20 Day moving average of closing stock price then if the selected day CLOSE has a price that his higher than the moving average a buy is initiated.  If a trade is currently on, no new buys can be placed and if the selected day CLOSE is below the 20 day moving average a sell is initiated. Every time a buy or sell is placed the data is recorded in a table created called backtest results.   The data Im using is from a hrefhttpfinance.yahoo.comqhpsAAPLHistoricalPrices relnofollowhttpfinance.yahoo.comqhpsAAPLHistoricalPricesa and I placed it into a table.  As you can see the the data is in descending order so in order for me to back test I have to start at  the earliest date which happens to be at the bottom.

Negative 17310 pWhere I work, each project is represented by a single JAR file. There are a set of database tables that are used for each project. Each of these projects have a Hibernate config and util inside that JAR, including the Entities.p  pI am now working on a project that will actually be using another projects database tables and thus, its Entities.p  pThe issue I run into is that when I include the JAR as a dependency through Maven, the main projects Hibernate config files are ignored and use the ones included in other projects JAR. This causes mapping issues with Entities and such, as you can imagine.p  pMy question is Is there  way to include the other JAR file as a dependency yet ignore the Hibernate config files Or at least make it use the ones in the main projectp  pI am trying to avoid duplicating the Entities and such as these tables may be altered in the future and would rather make changes in one project than several.p  pThank you again for your help Much appreciatedp

Negative 17310 pthis is my first question so I hope to be as concise as possible.  p  pIm currently using gradle in order to build and run about 1.7k tests.  The tests are being run by using the command useTestNG  excludeGroups functional,integration,performance,serialization,endtoend,version.p  pThe issue Im having with this is that when forking up 5 instances of chrome, they start off all running the tests and then a bit of the way through 4 will be running, then 3, then two, then 1.

Ideally, if all 5 instances would run the duration of the test period, then the time it takes to execute all the tests could dramatically decrease. p  pI found that TestNG has an option parallel which can be passed to in which tells it how to split up its tests.

Negative 17310 pIm currently making a todo list windows form application as a project. I have the program moreorless working, however the one thing that currently isnt working is the delete feature. p  pBasically the way my program currently works is that I use whatever task title that they select inside the List Box, the data associated with it i.e. priority, start date, end date are all found by using the same index position. This index position is found by using a Linear Search within the task title array, using the title that the user selects in the list box as the key.p  pI clear the contents of that element of the array by resetting it to the original default value that was present in that element before the data was added, for example I reset contents of the element within the task title array by setting the contents to null.p  pI then refresh the list box contents using the followingp  precodetaskListBox.DataSource  null taskListBox.DataSource  DataArrays.titleArr codepre  pHowever, the full code for this method is below.p  precodepublic void deleteSelectedTaskref ListBox taskListBox      MainForm main  new MainForm     DataInput input  new DataInput      string key  Convert.ToStringtaskListBox.SelectedValue      int i  getTaskKeykey      DataArrays.titleArr[i]  null     DataArrays.descArr[i]  null     DataArrays.priorityArr[i]  0     DataArrays.startDateArr[i]  Convert.ToDateTime01010001     DataArrays.endDateArr[i]  Convert.ToDateTime01010001     DataArrays.completeArr[i]  null      taskListBox.DataSource  null     taskListBox.DataSource  DataArrays.titleArr  codepre  pAt present this method kindof works and technically does remove the element, however for some reason this affects the data source for the array and doesnt always successfully refresh.p  pFor example, say you had 3 tasks inputted into the array. You delete the task that was in element position 3, this method works fine The task is successfully removed from the array and is not seen once the list box refreshes.p  pHOWEVER, if the user decides to delete a task that is a predescessor to another task, i.e. tasks 1 or 2, the list box decides not to display any of the consecutive tasks EVEN IF they havent been selected to be deleted. For example, if you delete task 1 from the list, tasks 2 and 3 would also disappear. OR if you delete task 2 from the list, task 3 would also disappear but task 1 would remain.p  pIm not sure what the problem is, I felt like having some fresh eyes on this code may aid this situation.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pDataArrays is literally used for storing my arraysp  precode    public class DataArrays              public static string[] titleArr  new string[9]         public static string[] descArr  new string[9]         public static int[] priorityArr  new int[9]         public static DateTime[] startDateArr  new DateTime[9]         public static DateTime[] endDateArr  new DateTime[9]         public static string[] completeArr  new string[9]      codepre

Negative 17310 pI am developing a Qt application using codeQTreeViewcode and codeQAbstractItemModelcode. The model contains somewhat heterogenous data, which requires different controls for editing. I am implementing it by having a custom delegate, that queries codemodel.dataQtEditRolecode and the model would return the codeQWidgetcode to be used as an editor.p  pI like how it works for codeQLineEditcode  when I hit enter, codedelegatesetModelDatacode is called automatically, so I do strongnotstrong have to connect codeQLineEditeditingFinishedcode to codeQAbstractItemDelegatesetModelDatacode, which is very convenient since the QLineEdit is returned from the model as codeQWidgetcode to the delegate and it doesnt have to care what kind of widget it is. With codeQComboBoxcode its a bit tricky  I want the comboBox to commit once the selection is made, so far I can only do it by codeconnectmyComboBox, SIGNALactivatedQString, myDelegate, commitDatacode However, my delegate doesnt know the type of the editor widget and I do not want to edit the delegates code for each new editor the model ends up passing it. I would really like to force combobox to do the same thing as QLineEdit does when the enter is clicked in the slot connected to its codeactivatedcode signal.p  pSo, what does the codeQLineEditcode do to call delegates codesetModelDatacode Is there a generic way in Qt for the editor whatever it is to say Im done editing, take the data and pass it to the modelp

Negative 17310 pI have just started coding in PHP. I previously worked in asp.net. In do net codewebmethodcode you return the data neatly to AJAX call. Trying in PHP I found that you at best can just codeechocode the data you want to return.p  pIf I convert the data to JSON on server and then return then it not sure PHP will not encode the error messages into it. That creates invalid JSON in client side code and the results are not possible to parse. p  pSo I want to know if there is something advanced I can do to always return neatly and nicely from the server, even when an error occursp  pClarification first when error occurs then decoding on the client from JSON is not possible. This is the question, actually.p
Negative 17310 pI am trying to create an efficient class with minimum codeduplication.p  pI have this definedp  precodePublic Class Foo     Private firstName as string       Private lastName as string        Public Sub NewByVal userGUID As Guid         query DB to get firstName and lastName         Me.Newdt.Rows0FirstName.ToString,dt.Rows0LastName.ToString     End Sub      Public Sub NewByVal firstName As String, ByVal lastName As String         firstName  firstName.toUpper         lastName  lastName.toUpper         Validate     End Sub      Private Sub Validate          Throw error if something is wrong     End Sub End Class codepre  pThe Constructor with firstName and lastName parameters is the endpoint constructor that does validation. A constructor with userGUID as a parameter would query DB to obtain name and call the final constructor. This way all execution should be directed towards one of the constructors that actually does all validation etc etc. The idea behind it is that if I add new contructors, I only have to pull necessary data firstnamelastname and call the final constructor that does validation. p  pHowever, there is a compilation error preventing me from using this system on line codeMe.Newdt.Rows0FirstName.ToString,dt.Rows0LastName.ToStringcode. Apparently this line has to be the first line in the constructor. But If I have this as first line, it will break the validation process because validation will throw an error due to no firstnamelastname. I have to query the DB in order to pull that info. p  pI am aware that I can assign values here and call validation from this constructor too, but this will effectively isolate this constructor from the final one, thus duplicating code and adding to maintenance a bit. FYI, in the example below I only have 2 constructors, but in reality i have several more. If each will do its own assignment it just adds up to maintenance that much.p  pSo, is there a way to achieve my task by executing some code and THEN calling an overloaded constructorp  pThank you for any insightp  pstrongUPDATE 1strongp  pPer thelotus comment, I am including dt definition. There is a workaround for this issue. Basically I would take the validation and assignment out of the final constructor and put it into a function. All constructors would call this function, thus eliminating the need to chain constructors. It doesnt look bad, but I would like to understand why in order to chain constructors I have to put constructor calls on the first line.p  pHere is new codep  pPublic Class Foo     Private firstName As String       Private lastName As String  p  precodePublic Sub NewByVal userGUID As Guid     Dim dt As New DataTable      query DB to get firstName and lastName      Assume I populate dt with at least one DataRow     AssignAndValidatedt.Rows0FirstName.ToString, dt.Rows0LastName.ToString     Me.Newdt.Rows0FirstName.ToString, dt.Rows0LastName.ToString End Sub  Public Sub NewByVal firstName As String, ByVal lastName As String     AssignAndValidatefirstName, lastName End Sub  Private Sub Validate      Throw error if something is wrong End Sub  Private Sub AssignAndValidateByVal firstName As String, ByVal lastName As String     firstName  firstName.ToUpper     lastName  lastName.ToUpper     Validate End Sub codepre  pEnd Classp  pOne curious not to mention online code converters vb.net to C have no issues converting chained constructor calls NOT on the first line. The C code comes back as codethis.ctordt.Rows0FirstName.ToString, dt.Rows0LastName.ToStringcode However, If I try to convert back to VB.NET, it fails. p

Instead it contains something different like ip7fba99a4141. The last two bytes seems to be overwritten, but no matter how many As I write, no more than those two bytes appears to be written according dmesg.

This emmightem be partially fixed by invoking a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.windows.namescope.registernamevvs.100.aspxcodeRegisterNamecodea for each child, but one would need to retrieve the correct codeNameScopecode instance. Also, I am not sure whether the behaviour when, for instance, the name of a child changes would be the same as in other panels.p  pInstead, setting the codeNameScopecode of the inner panel seems to be the way to go.

As far as I could find out by means of a hrefhttpssnoopwpf.codeplex.comSnoopa, the actual codeNameScopecode instance is only stored in the a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms60118328vvs.10029.aspxcodeNameScopecode attached propertya of either the parent window, or the root of the enclosing visual tree defined by a control template or possibly by some other key node, no matter what type.

However, in the inner panel, I can only access a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.windows.uielement.inputhittest28vvs.11029.aspxcodeInputHitTestcodea, so I am neither sure how to safely process the raw a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.windows.media.hittestresult28vvs.11029.aspxcodeHitTestResultcodea instance without losing or ignoring any of the information that the original implementation would have respected, nor how to process the a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.windows.media.geometryhittestparameters28vvs.11029.aspxcodeGeometryHitTestParameterscodea, as codeInputHitTestcode only accepts a simple a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.windows.pointvvs.110.aspxcodePointcodea.p  pMoreover, the controls are also not focusable, e.g. by pressing kbdTabkbd. I do not know how to fix this.p  pBesides, I am slightly wary of going this way, as I am not sure what internal links between the inner panel and the original list of children I am breaking by replacing that list of children with a custom object.p  hr  pstrong4 Inherit directly from panel classstrongp  pUser a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comusers1136211clemensClemensa suggests to directly have my class inherit from a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.windows.controls.dockpanel28vvs.11029.aspxcodeDockPanelcodea. However, there are two reasons why that is not a good ideap  ul liThe current version of my panel will rely on the layouting logic of codeDockPanelcode. However, it is possible that at some point in the future, that will not be enough any more and someone will indeed have to write custom layouting logic in my panel. In that case, replacing an inner codeDockPanelcode with custom layouting code is trivial, but removing codeDockPanelcode from the inheritance hierarchy of my panel would mean a breaking change.li liIf my panel inherits from a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.windows.controls.dockpanel28vvs.11029.aspxcodeDockPanelcodea, users of the panel might be able to sabotage its layouting code by messing around with properties exposed by codeDockPanelcode, in particular a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.windows.controls.dockpanel.lastchildfill28vvs.11029.aspxcodeLastChildFillcodea. And while it is just that property, I would like to use an approach that works with all a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.windows.controls.panel28vvs.11029.aspxcodePanelcodea subtypes. For instance, a custom panel derived from a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.windows.controls.grid28vvs.11029.aspxcodeGridcodea would expose the a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.windows.controls.grid.columndefinitions28vvs.11029.aspxcodeColumnDefinitionscodea and a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.windows.controls.grid.rowdefinitions28vvs.11029.aspxcodeRowDefinitionscodea properties, by which any automatically generated layout could be completely destroyed via the public interface of the custom panel.li ul  hr  pAs a test case for observing the described issues, add an instance of the custom panel being tested in XAML, and within that element, add the followingp  precodeltTextBox Nametb1 DockPanel.DockRightgt ltTextBlock TextBinding Text, ElementNametb1 DockPanel.DockLeftgt codepre  pThe text block should be left of the text box, and it should show whatever is currently written in the text box.p  pI would expect the text box to be clickable, and the output view not to display any binding errors so, the binding should work, as well.p  hr  pThus, my question isp  ul listrongCan any one of my attempts be fixed to lead to a completely correct solution Or is there a completely other way that is preferrable to what I have tried to do what I am looking forstrongli ul

Negative 17310 pI was reading the spring documentation for spring batch project, I want to know if there is an out of the box configuration to chain steps, it means the output of the first step be the input for the second one and so on.  Im not asking about step flows which one execute after other, is more about use the exit of the item processor of a step to be the input of the next one.p  pWhat I have in mind is use a normal step with reader, processor and in the writer create a flat file that could be reader by the second reader in the next step but this seems to be inefficiently as need to write objects that are in the jvm and restore them with the second reader.p  pIf not sure if this is possible with spring normal config, or jsr does not work exactly as I wantp

Negative 17310 pthe title of the question might be a little bit missleading but I am not sure how to describe my problem.p  pI want to restructure the keys of an array such that the loop will jump with the following patternp  pExample 1p  precodekeys from 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 will lead to 1,9,5,3,7,2,6,4,8 codepre  ul litake the first element  1li litake the last element  9li litake the middle 192  5li ligo to the first half and take the middle of 1 and 5  3li lijump to the second half and take the middle of 5 and 9  7li lijump back to the first half of the first half and take 2li lijump back to the first half of the second half and take 6li lijump back to the second half of the first half and take 4li lijump back to the second half of the second half and take 8li ul  pOf course, this is an idealized example where everything is nicely dividable. If this is not the case you have to floor and ceil to get the new elements to divide. p  pExample 2p  precodekey from 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 will lead to 1,10,5,6,3,8,2,7,4,9 codepre  pWith my small knowledge about algorithm and datastructures I tried to use recursiondivide and conquer but I did not manage to realize the jumps between the halfs.p  pSo I think I have to add parameters like the length of the divided halfs an the positions but here I am lost for implementation. p  pThe interesting question for me is Is my thinking to complicated and is there a much easier solution Or is this problem really this complexp  pI am happy for any advise on literature ore code snippets to try it.p  pThanks and best regards Stephan    p

Negative 17310 pIm learning iOS at school but cant seem to get my head around the coding..  Which is what I need to do for my final project. Thus I would like to seek your kind help and guidance here...I kind of grasped the concept of how I would like my app to go, and how to create the GUIprobably but would need advice on the coding for it and the data persistency. Say my main viewcontroller is a tableview which is empty at first, but if I click on the add button, it will direct me to a form where you can fill in a persons name and say maybe their score. Then when you save and go back to the main view, the persons name is listed out. You can add more persons or edit a person by tapping on the nameit will return you back to the form where you can edit the score etc.p  pThanks in advance I did revise my notes many times but I still couldnt get it ltp
Negative 17310 pI have a big hexadecimal number, for example codeCD4A0619FB0907BC00000code 25 or any other number like this. Now, using standard CC code only no libraries like Boost, I want to convert this number to the decimal number 15511210043330985984000000. Unfortunately, its too big for a 64 bit integer like codelong longcode and I dont want to use any floating point data types either. If this is possible at all, how can you do thisp

Negative 17310 pI have an invoice style RDLC report with a page header showing the invoice address and page footer showing the invoice values. The items for the invoice are a tablix shown within a bordered rectangle.p  pWhen the report prints the rectangle sizes to fit the number of invoice items so with one item I get a very small rectangle and a lot of white space. Looks absolutely awful.p  pIm trying to get the rectangle to fill the space between the fixed page header and fixed page footer. p  pIs this possible with RDLC The only answer Ive found is to add temporary blank lines to the report data source.p  pId appreciate any ideas.p
Negative 17310 pI am trying to connect either the rows of an codenxmcode array to code1xmcode arrays in codencode individual components or connect slices of an code1xnmcode array to code1xmcode arrays in codencode individual components. The original codenxmcode or code1xnmcode array would then be used as an optimization parameter. The problem is that the assembly seems to have some serious problems when I do this. I either get obviously wrong answers or a size mismatch error.p  pI have been able to get the assembly to work by passing in codencode code1xmcode arrays using codeexeccode, but I would much prefer the method explained previously. If anyone can tell me how to make this work in a proper way I would really appreciate it.p  pI have provided a simplified example of code for what works and what I want to do. The method I would like to use is shown first, followed by the method I have gotten to work, but seriously dislike.p  hr  h2What I want to doh2  precode    from openmdao.main.api import Assembly,

Negative 17310 pRecently someone tried attempting a brute force password hack of my CMS.

However, I am hoping to take this one step further.p  pMy site is accessible on the Internet for all users to see.

Negative 17310 pI am creating a table in my spreadsheet that contains categories, questions and answers for a quiz.

I have also generated a count, so I am able to identify how many times this work appears across the quiz table.p  pMy problem is I am struggling to develop a loop so that if the key phrase is found 6 times for example, i want 6 questions and answers to be listed to the user. Currently it is only pulling the final time it is found.p  pMy current code includes the followingp  precodePrivate Sub CommandButton1Click     If Lensearchtext  0 Then         MsgBox Please enter a key word to search for, vbCritical     End If      Dim wordCount As Integer     wordCount  Application.WorksheetFunction.CountIfSheet1.RangeA2c600,  amp searchtext.Value amp      Else wordCount  WorksheetFunction.CountIfSheet1.RangeA2c600, searchtext.Value      If wordCount  0 Then         MsgBox No match found     Else         Sheet2.Rangea7.Value  WorksheetFunction.VLookup amp searchtext.Value amp , Sheet1.RangeA2c600, 3, False         Sheet2.Rangeb7  wordCount     End If  End Sub codepre  pAny advice on implementing a loop and to allow the questionanswer to be printed one after another would be very much appreciated.

Negative 17310 pIve got a bit of code that is suppose to change the text displayed in the entry fields depending on which item is selected in the tree view. Ive bound the event to both the left mouse and up and down arrow keys and its sort of working.

If there are three 5, 7, 4 values and the item with value 4 is selected, the entry field will display the item with value 7 in it. Its always one off.

Negative 17310 pIm building a TomcatJava MVC Servlet app using Spring MVC and Spring Security, and have come upon what looks to me like an architectural inconsistency between the functionality of the Controller and the Authorization step.p  pIn standard MVC a display Controller examines the request, builds the model representation of the business resources involved, and specifies the view that is to render the output to the client.p  pIn my use case the business resource being served is a photo album consisting of a configuration file containing album title, copyright, etc cached metadata dimensions, thumbnails, access requirements, etc and the actual images.  Some Albums are private, requiring that the user be logged in and have a specific group membership.  This part is well encapsulated in an codeAlbumcode class and associated factory responsible for managing instances.  Prior to adding security the Controller used the factory to find the requested codeAlbumcode instance, and placed it into the Model for use by the View.p  pThen I added Spring Security to the mix. Since Authorization happens in the servlet filter chain before the Controller is invoked and Authorization needs access to the codeAlbumcode object to make an access control decision,  I am forced to locateinstantiate the codeAlbumcode during the Authorization phase instead.  This doesnt feel quite right but I cant see any other way to accomplish my goals without duplicating functionality.p  pQuestion Is it a normal pattern in web applications for some of the modelbuilding to get pushed back into the Authorization step, or have I missed something important  BTW, in order not to lookupinstantiate the model object twice I plan to put it into the codeHttpServletRequestcode as an attribute for use by the Controller.p
