Positive 5584 pIm a C application developer on Windows system. Im developing an application using EGL 1.4 and OpenGL ES 2.0.p  pIn a certain kind of a OpenGL32.DLL version, I found that a PVR error message occurred. The versions of OpenGL32.DLL that cause this problem are 6.3.9600.16384 on Win8.1 and 4.0.1379.1. And the message says p  pPVR Messagep  pPVR VFrame attempted to use one of these functions PVR wglChoosePixelFormatARB PVR but they are not present on you machine.p  pIgnorep  pThis message appeared when I call eglChooseConfig or eglGetConfigs functions in EGL API to get system configs.p  pI think this problem occurred because OpenGL32.dll versions mentioned above dont support wglChoosePixelFormatARB function.p  pMost of versions that I tested worked well. List of working version is  5.2.3790.3959 6.1.7600.16385 6.3.9600.163841000kb 10.0.10130.0p  pAnd list of not working version is  4.0.1379.1 5.1.2600.1280 5.1.2600.5512 6.3.9600.16384 720kbp  pTo solve this problem, I want to include this dll file in my product for a commercial use. I want to know that distributing a working version of OpenGL32.dll is possible. And can you know me the list of OpenGL32.dll version without this error and license information about OpenGL32.dllp  pThank you and I will be waiting for your reply.p

Positive 5584 pTypically I load all uniform variables whether I need to or not just before I draw a mesh. For example in WebGLp  precodegl.uniformMatrix4fvprogram.ModelView, false, ModelView.array var MVP  Projection.multModelView gl.uniformMatrix4fvprogram.ModelViewProjection, false, MVP.array var NormalMatrix  ModelView.normal gl.uniformMatrix3fvprogram.NormalMatrix, false, NormalMatrix gl.uniform3fvprogram.materalDiffuse, materialDiffuse gl.uniform3fvprogram.materalAmbient, [1.0, 1.0, 1.0]  ...etc...  ... draw mesh via gl.drawArrays or gl.drawElements codepre  pSome of these uniforms may not have changed since the previous calls to codegl.drawArraysElementscode so loading them is often redundant. Should I worry about this overheadp  pI could add a codedirtycode bit to the client variables and only load uniform variables that need to be changed e.g.p  precodeif ModelView.dirty  Projection.dirty     gl.uniformMatrix4fvprogram.ModelView, false, ModelView.array    var MVP  Projection.multModelView    gl.uniformMatrix4fvprogram.ModelViewProjection, false, MVP.array    ModelView.dirty  Projection.dirty  false  codepre  pI would then set the respective codedirtycode bits whenever codeModelViewcode or codeProjectioncode is mutated. p  pIs it worth the effort to try and limit uniform variables loadsp

I call it for a single plane, so using GLLUMINANCE as the GL type as it is planarp  pIf the 2 new keys mentioned above are used codeCVOpenGLTextureCacheCreateTextureFromImagecode does not generate an error but the final output is blank. p  pIf I just replace this custom format with 420f the standard biplanar format that we get from Apple, and call the function for the luminance plane, it works. So, the code itself doesnt have an issue.p  pMy question is what does the key codekCVPixelBufferOpenGLESTextureCacheCompatibilityKeycode do And what can I look into to make my custom format compatible with the codeCVOpenGLTextureCacheCreateTextureFromImagecode functionp

Positive 5584 pIm a programmer new to Java. Based on what Ive read on OOP, I understand that you shouldnt code in a way that you have to rewrite everything to change something. Ive always tried to apply design patterns, refactoring etc. and I was actually excited about the potential fixability.p  pThen came my first major change I decided to implement GLES instead of using canvas for drawing operations. Unfortunately, GLES required a lot more steps for drawing, e.g. preloading of textures. As a result, I couldnt just reimplement existing interfaces that defined most of my apps methods I had to touch every single class in my app.p  pI guess my question is, would this be a case of incorrect employment of OOP, a situation that OOP couldnt have averted, i.e. I didnt make the right choices at the start, or perhaps an Android thing If it is something Im doing wrong, some example solutions would be a great help. Thanksp
Positive 5584 pI wrote a video play view, it is a SurfaceView with a MediaPlayer instance. I attached the mediaplayer to the surface holder when surface created then start the play. p  pThis is easy and everyone knows the details. But I want to draw a bitmap which is the first frame of the video to the surfaceview.Canvas is not a choice to draw the bitmap, because it will disable the mediaplayer to connect.p  pSince api level 14, we can new a surface with surfacetexture. So we can use opengl es to draw video frame and bitmap.  But I am concerned about the performance.This way of playing video is more complicated and will it cause more overhead Who can give me some advicesp

Positive 5584 pI am currently trying to record a video in square shape and create a output as .mp4. It seems to be really challenging. I tried diffrent approches including OnPreviewFrame and FFMpeg. But never got a satisfing result. Today i found Grafika. And it seems to be the right way. But because of the complextity of the Code i am stuck now. Using the Example CameraCaptureActivity.java i managed to record a video. But its shape is rectangluar and not square. Furthermore the camera is rotated by 90 degrees.  I was already trying to manipulate certain parameters but never got a good video. Some where squeezed and so on.p  pDoes anybody know what parameters i need to change inside Grafikas example to get the right result  In the end the camera of my android phone should record Videos like Vine or Instagram.p  pThanks for your helpp
Positive 5584 pI have a project in mind where two displays are connected to the same application. The first display does the processing and renders the scene, while sending instructions to the second display over Wifi which also renders a part of the scene.p  pI would like this to be easy to integrate in Unity projects which run on Android and iOS platforms iOS being one of the receiving displays. p  pI was thinking this would be possible by streaming video, but there would be a noticeable delay and more importantly heavy processing involved.p  pMy second thought would be to stream OpenGL calls to the second device, which would at least remove the heavy processing. This has been done before with projects called Chromium and ClusterGL.p  pI am wondering however if Unity can allow for such an application or that the OpenGL calls are obscured.

Positive 5584 pIm currently working on an OpenGL project in Android. Right now, Im trying to create a clip for items to be confined to when drawing, using the stencil buffer. My problem is that I would like to be able to create a clip shape, and then remove portions of that clipped shape later on much like in an Android Canvas calling clipPath with Region.Op.UNION and then another clipPath call with Region.Op.DIFFERENCEp  pBasically, my intention is to only draw to portions of the screen with a stencil buffer bit of value 1. Therefore, as I understand it, I should be able to draw to the stencil buffer with different glStencilOp functions that will allow me to draw with 1s in some areas, and then perhaps replace them later on with the default 0 in portions of those areas.p  pAs an example test, I tried to clip a doughnut on the screen, using something like thisp  precodegl20.glClearGL20.GLDEPTHBUFFERBIT  Clear stencil buffer. gl20.glEnableGL20.GLSTENCILTEST  Enable stencil test. gl20.glColorMaskfalse, false, false, false  Disable color drawing. gl20.glStencilMask0xFF  Set 0xFF as stencil mask.   Have stencil test always fail, replace drawn stencil bits with 1. gl20.glStencilFuncGL20.GLNEVER, 1, 0xFF  gl20.glStencilOpGL20.GLREPLACE, GL20.GLKEEP,GL20.GLKEEP   Draw outer circle    Now, replace drawn stencil bits with 0. gl20.glStencilOpGL20.GLZERO, GL20.GLKEEP, GL20.GLKEEP   Draw inner circle.    Reenable color drawing.  gl20.glColorMasktrue, true, true, true  Now, items drawn will be confined to areas with 1 stencil bit. gl20.glStencilFuncGL20.GLEQUAL, 1, 0xFF gl20.glStencilOpGL20.GLKEEP, GL20.GLKEEP, GL20.GLKEEP gl20.glStencilMask0x00   Draw a filled, colored rectangle to the entire screen.  codepre  pNow, as I understand it, this should result in a colored doughnut drawn to the screen However, as the code is written above, nothing is drawn to the screen.p  pHowever, if I only clip the outer circle and not try to get rid of the inner circle with the gl20.glStencilOpGL20.GLZERO, GL20.GLKEEP, GL20.GLKEEP call and subsequent inner circle drawing, a circle the size of the intended outer circle draws on the screen. p  pIve looked through the documentation that I could find, and everything that Ive read so far indicates that this should work. Is there something that Im missing here Any help is greatly appreciated.p  pAlso, if this helps at all I am using the ShapeRenderer from the LibGDX open source project to draw shapes. p

Positive 5584 pId like help with grabbing frames from an online video stream on the iOS platform.p  pThe video stream comes from an URL, and should be applied to a specific geometry as a texture. Unfortunately AVPlayer doesnt seem to support this.p  pAny kind of opensource library or solution in Objective C or C,C would do it, if you could recommend. Even a library that could read the video from the URL and had a function that returned the actual WH pixel data would be of enormous help. In that case the pixels could be uploaded using double PBOs and glTexSubImage2D even if thats not the fastest.p

Negative 5584 psa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions354160whatdoyoudowhileyourcodescompiling354176An answeras strongsee belowstrong to one of the questions right here on StacknbspOverflow gave me an idea for a great little piece of software that could be invaluable to coders everywhere.p  pIm imagining RAM drive software, but with one crucial difference  it would mirror a real folder on my hard drive. More specifically  the folder which contains the project Im currently working on. This way any builds would be nearly instantaneous or at least a couple orders of magnitude faster. The RAM drive would synchronize its contents with the hard disk drive in background using only idle resources.p  pA quick Google search revealed nothing, but perhaps I just dont know how to Google. Perhaps someone knows of such a software Preferably free, but reasonable fees might be OK too.p  pbAddedb Some solutions have been suggested which I discarded in the very beginning. They would be in no particular orderp  ul libBuy a faster hard disk drive a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiSolidstatedrive relnofollowSSDa maybe or 10K RPM.b I dont want a hardware solution. Not only software has the potential to be cheaper freeware, anyone, but it can also be used in environments where hardware modifications would be unwelcome if not impossible  say, at the office.li libLet OSHDD do the caching  it knows better how to use your free RAM.b The OSHDD have generic cache algorithms that cache everything and try to predict which data will be most needed in the future. They have no idea that for me the priority is my project folder. And as we all know quite well  they dont really cache it much anyway. li libThere are plenty of RAM drives around use one of those.b Sorry, that would be reckless. I need my data to be synchronized back to the HDD whenever there is a bit of free time. In the case of a power failure I could bear losing the last five minutes of work, but not everything since my last checkin.li ul  pbAdded 2b An idea that came up  use a normal RAM drive plus a background folder synchronizer but I do mean bbackgroundb. Is there any such thingp  pbAdded 3b Interesting. I just tried out a simple RAM drive at work. The rebuild time drops from 14nbspsecs to 7nbspsecs not bad, but incremental build is still at 5nbspsecs  just like on the HDD. Any ideas why It uses codeaspnetcompilercode and codeaspnetmergecode. Perhaps they do something with other temp files elsewherep  pbAdded 4b Oh, nice new set of answers  OK, Ive got a bit more info for all you naysayers. p  pOne of the main reasons for this idea is not the abovementioned software 14nbspsecs build time, but another one that I didnt have access at the time. This other application has a 100nbspMB code base, and its full build takes about 5 minutes. Ah yes, its in a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiEmbarcaderoDelphi relnofollowDelphi 5a, so the compiler isnt too advanced.  Putting the source on a RAM drive resulted in a BIG difference. I got it below a minute, I think. I havent measured. So for all those who say that the OS can cache stuff better  Id beg to differ.p  pstrongRelated Questionstrong  p  blockquote   pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions501718ramdiskforspeedupideRAM disk for speed up IDEap blockquote  pstrongNote on first linkstrong The question to which it links has been deleted because it was a duplicate.

Negative 5584 pHow do I detect when my Compact Framework application is being smartminimized smart minimize is what happens when the user clicks the X button in the topright corner on a Pocket PCp  pThe Deactivate event isnt the right way because it occurs in circumstances other than minimization, such as when a message box or another form is shown on top of the main form. And the forms WindowState doesnt help because there is no Minimized WindowState on .NET CF.p  pI heard that by setting MinimizeBox  false, my app will be closed instead of minimized.

Negative 5584 pIm trying setup a subset of boost and get it properly compiled using bjam, however Im not getting the result Im looking for. Im working on windows using boost 1.37.0.p  pLets say I want the libraries smartptr and filesystem builtinstalled. I intentionally chose a header only library and one library needing to compile a library. I want them to be built into a directory structure similar to the one I would get if I built a complete boost installation with bjam i.e not specifying any withlibraryX but of course without all the libraries Im not interested in.p  pMy first approach was to use the withfilesystem withsmartptr in bjam, however it seemed like it didnt recognize smartptr I tried smartptr and smartptr without success. I guess this is because its a header only library. p  pWhen I removed it and only had withfilesystem it seemed to copy ALL libraries header files to the install path and only build the libraries for filesystem. The library building behavior was the one I hoped for, but I got tons of header files for libraries Im not interested in installed in my boost directory. p  pMy second approach was to use bcp to copy the relevant projects. This did work out in the sense that I only got the projects I cared about and their dependencies. However they didnt provide any make files for building the libraries that was copied. This means I would need to setup projects files for all the libraries that are not header only and manually build them.p  pSo my question is basically, is there a way of selectively building boost that only copies the headers for the libraries Im interested in and only building library files for the non header only libraries Im interested in and the boost libraries they are dependent on coursep  pThere are probably tons of manualscripting based solutions for this, but if I could get something running only using bjam would be way more useful for me since adding new libraries or upgrading to a new boost version would be very simple.p  pEDIT Added the complete command line for the first approachp  precodebjam install prefixctempboostsmall     builddirCtempboostsmalltemp layoutsystem     withfilesystem variantdebug linkstatic threadingmulti    runtimelinkstatic codepre  pChanged scopedptr to smartptrp

Each of the Methods classes contain EntityManager initialization via EntityManagerFactory and some methods that basically execute queries. I dont know if I should use a singleton pattern so that I have an EntityManager per Method class or if I need to open and close the EntityManager each time I execute a query or I persistremove an entity... can you help mep

When using a framework, you hand control to the new framework and you have to unlearn many things and relearn them the new way as your new framework requires. Is this true, and which framework is most flexible when it comes to this unlearning aspectp

Negative 5584 pIm looking for some input for a challenge that Im currently facing.p  pI have built a custom WIF STS which I use to identify users who want to call some WCF services that my system offers. The WCF services use a custom authorization manager that determines whether or not the caller has the required claims to invoke a given service.p  pNow, Im building a WPF app. on top of those WCF services. Im using the MVVM pattern, such that the View Model invokes the protected WCF services which implement the Model. The challenge that Im facing is that I do not know whether or not the current user can succesfully invoke the web service methods without actually invoking them. Basically, what I want to achieve is to enabledisable certain parts of the UI based on the ability to succesfully invoke a method.p  pThe best solution that I have come up with thus far is to create a service, which based on the same business logic as the custom authorization policy manager will be able to determine whether or not a user can invoke a given method. Now, the method would have to passed to this service as a string, or actually two strings, ServiceAddress and Method Action, and based on that input, the service would be able to determine if the current user has the required claims to access the method. Obviously, for this to work, this service would itself have to require a issued token from the same STS, and with the same claims, in order to do its job.p  pHave any of you done something similar in the past, or do you have any good ideas on how to do thisp  pThanks in advance,p  pKlausp

Negative 5584 pCan someone help giving me some direction to tackle a scenario like this.  A User table which contains all the user information, UserID is the primary key on User Table. I have another table called for example Comments, which holds all the comments created by any user. Comments table contains UserID as the foreign key. Now i have to rank the Users based on number of comments they added. The more comments a user added, the ranking goes up. I am trying to see what will be the best way to do this. p  pI would prefer to have another table, which basically contains all the attributes or statistics of a usermight have more attributes in future, right now only rank, based on comment count,rather than adding another column in User table itself. p  pIf I create another table Called UserStats, and have UserID as the foreign Key, and have another column, called Rank, there is a possibility that everytime a user adds a comment,  we might need to update the ranks.

Negative 5584 pWe are in the process of writing a native windows app MFC that will be uploading some data to our web app. Windows app will allow user to login and after that it will periodically upload some data to our web app. Upload will be done via simple HTTP POST to our web app. The concern Im having is how can we ensure that the upload actually came from our app, and not from curl or something like that. I guess were looking at some kind of publicprivate key encryption here. But Im not sure if we can somehow just embed a public key in our win app executable and be done with it. Or would that public key be too easy to extract and use outside of our appp  pAnyway, were building both sides client and server so pretty much anything is an option, but it has to work through HTTPS. However, we do not control the execution environment of win client app, plus the user that is running the app on hisher system is the only one that stands to gain something by gaming the system.p

The surface is actually a 3D terrain, but the third dimension does not matter as it is determined by terrain height.p  pThe problem is i would like to do this in the most effecient and easy way, but still get good results. What i mean by natural is something like mentoined a hrefhttpwww.riemers.netengTutorialsXNACsharpSeries4Perlinnoise.php relnofollowin this article about Perlin noisea. trees forming forests, large to small groups spread out on the land The approach is nice, but too complicated. I need to do this quite often and prefferably without any more textures involved, even at the cost of worse performance so the results wont be as pretty, but still good enough to give a nice natural terrain with vegetation.p  pThe amount of objects placed varies, but generally is around 50. A nice enhancement would be to somehow restrict placement of objects at areas with very high altitude mountains but i guess it could be done by placing a bit more objects and deleting those placed above a given altitude.p

I would both like advice as to how to streamline these files without too much magic and how to fix these two errors...p  pFirst I have to say everything is working, so to speak.  When I build my target it creates all the directories right and generates the executable.  And all my files get copied properly and get recompiled when I touch the files in my baselevel source directory.  So these arent real errors so to speak, just annoying error text I want to get rid of...p  pThe first error occurs when I run a build codemake moleculetestcode which requires it to do something.  Whatever it needs to do gets done, but I also getp  precodeg g No such file or directory g g No such file or directory g g No such file or directory g g No such file or directory g g No such file or directory g g No such file or directory make  [moleculetest] Error 1 codepre  p..AGAIN the build succeeds, creating the executable properlyp  pThe second error I get occurs when theres nothing to be done...when that happens I getp  precodebinsh c line 0 unexpected EOF while looking for matching  binsh c line 1 syntax error unexpected end of file codepre  pPlease be gentle... Ive read basic makefile tutorials, including the gnu makefile tutorial, but there seems to be a leap between creating a small program with a handful of local sources and a large program with the need for nested directories, data files, etc.  Im trying to make that leap... unfortunately I have no best practice makefiles from past code as Im at a small research group at a university, not a corporate atmosphere.p  pMy basic approach is to create a base directory with the followingp  precode[dir] source [dir] data [dir] makefiles [dir] build    gets created Makefile codepre  pThe top level makefile creates a subdirectory in the build directory, copies the needed sources say for a particular test program, and needed data files, and a makefile to make all the sources.  The top level makefile then calls the buildlevel makefile.p  pId be open to ideas on how to streamline this process, but would appreciate if we FIRST resolve the errors.p  pThanks in advancep  pP.S.

Negative 5584 pIm using this program IMAPSize to backup an IMAP inbox.  It makes the backup in CProgram FilesIMAPSizebackup, but somehow the backup folder is only visible to the program, and not to Windows Explorer or even Command Prompt  Show hidden files is on.  Ive already tried running as Administrator.  When I go to the select backup folder option in IMAPSize, the folderpicker indeed shows the backup folder and its subtree, but the folder has a lock icon on it.  Windows Explorer lets me create the backup folder in the same place, after which the IMAPSize program still sees the entire subtree, but now the lock icon is on the subfolder of the backup folder.  Now Explorer can see the backup folder but it appears empty to it.  If I move the backup folder, these phantom contents seem to move with it, i.e. they can be deletedrestored from Recycle Bin.  Ive also tried changing file ownership and security settings  by default the folder has permissions for TrustedInstaller  but nothing helps.  It seems that literally the only program that can view these folders and files is IMAPSize  What the heck is going on  How can NTFS files be purely visible to only one single programp

Id like them to be able to use the page, if they desire, after clicking the Back button.p  pI first tried using headermeta tags to tell the browser not to cache the page, but that didnt work in Firefox 3.6.8  and then I decided I didnt want to do that anyway, because it probably wouldnt be crossbrowser compatible, and may not be a best practice anyway a hrefhttpsupport.microsoft.comkb199805 relnofollowherea is one such case to be made. I dont want to use anything that breaks the Back button like some applications Ive seen do like, when the user clicks it, it doesnt take them back a page, but forces them to stay on that page, which to me seems like a bad idea. Does anyone know of a way I can prevent duplicate form submission on the client side without rendering the page useless when the user clicks the Back button In case it matters at all, Im using ASP.NET MVC 1.p

Negative 5584 pI am developing a background service which needs to run on Windows, Linux, Mac OS and Solaris. The service is very simple and is to be used to track students logging in and out of university computers.

I can learn the fundamentals from those but there is something more specific which I need which seems to be much too specific a topic to be covered by the books I have.p  pThe question is about native events on Linux and Mac OS which a background service can register to respond to when a user logs in and out. I would also need to get the user id of the user who logged in or out which should be more straightforward once the first item is solved.p  pBeing new to native development for Linux and Mac OS I could really benefit from some help from more experience developers for these platforms. A friend suggested that PAM can be used to register to be notified of such events. Is this true p  pI may not need to know the exact details of everything I have to do but it would be good to know what native events  mechanisms are available to achieve this if any but I am hoping there are because Windows certainly has them. p  pKind Regardsp  pCarlp

Negative 5584 pMy main aim is to serve large number of XML files   1bn each lt1kb via web server. Files can be considered as staic as those will be modified by external code, in relatively very low frequency about 50k updates per day. Files will be requested in high frequency 30 reqsec.p  pCurrent suggestion from my team is to create a dedicated Java application to implement HTTP protocal and use memcached to speed up the thing, keeping all file data in RDBMS and getting rid of file system.p  pOn other hand, I think, a tweaked Apache Web Server or lighttpd should be enough. Caching can be left to OS or web servers defalt caching. There is no point in keeping data in DB if the same output is required and only queried based on file name. Not sure how memcached will work here. Also updating external cache memcached while updating file via external code will add complexity.p  pAlso other question, if I choose to use files is is possible to store those in directory like abcd.xml and access via abcd.xml Or should I put all 1bn files in single directory Not sure OS will allow it or not.p  pThis is NOT a website, but for an application API in closed network so CloudCDN is of no use.p  pI am planning to use CentOS  Apachelighttpd.

Negative 5584 pI looked into the implementation of Array.Resize and noticed that a new array is created and returned. Im aiming for zero memory allocation during gameplay and so I need to avoid creating any new reference types. Does resizing an array trigger the Garbage Collector on the previous array Im creating my own 2D array resizer, but it essentially functions in the same way as the .NET codeResizecode method.p  pIf the new array is smaller than the previous one, but excess objects have already been placed back into a generic object pool, will this invoke the GCp  pArrays will constantly be created in my game loop, so I need to try and make it as efficient as possible.

Negative 5584 pWhile attempting to override the explicit interface implementation of the codeICollectionltTgt.IsReadOnlycode property from the codeCollectionltTgtcode class, I came across some documents stating that explicit interface member implementations cannot be overridden because they cannot have modifiers such as codevirtualcode or codeabstractcode. On a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryaa66459328VS.7129.aspxMSDNa they even go as far as specifying how to make an explicit interface member implementation available for inheritance by creating another abstract or virtual member which is called by the explicit interface member implementation. No problems so far.p  pBut then I wonder strongWhy is it possible in C to override emanyem explicitly implemented interface member just by specifying the interface emexplicitlyemstrongp  pFor example, suppose I have a simple interface like this, with a property and methodp  precodepublic interface IMyInterface      bool AlwaysFalse  get      bool IsTruebool value  codepre  pAnd a class codeAcode which implements the interface explicitly, and has a method codeTestcode which calls its own interface member implementation.p  precodepublic class A  IMyInterface      bool IMyInterface.AlwaysFalse      get  return false        bool IMyInterface.IsTruebool value      return value       public bool Test      return IMyInterfacethis.AlwaysFalse   codepre  pAs you can see, none of the four members are virtual or abstract, so when I define a class codeBcode like thisp  precodepublic class B  A      public bool AlwaysFalse      get  return true        public bool IsTruebool value      return value   codepre  pThen youd expect an instance of codeBcode cast to codeAcode to behave like codeAcode.

Negative 5584 pI need to create a deep zoom mosaic in an HTML5 Canvas Element with thousands of roughly 512x512 images, but I want to reinvent the wheel as little as possible.p  pSo rather than combining tons and tons of large images into one then creating a Deep Zoom Image, Id rather make a load of deep zoom images and create a Deep Zoom Collection, but Seadragon doesnt support the DZC format.p  pThe way I see it I have three other options, which arep  ol liStart from scratch, create a viewer which deals with loading DZC filesli liExtend Seadragon to allow it to handle DZC filesli liCreate some way to parse the DCZ file, process its relevant images and turn it into a huge DZI fileli ol  pI was hoping I could get a bit of advice here, maybe a sounding board from someone with more experience in Deep Zoom and the XML format it uses to recommend which would be the easiest and best considering I have a tight deadline.p  pAny advice would be awesome.

Mootools handles the page scrolling  page scrolls up and down within a specified div. p  pJquery handles all other effects.p  pThe problem is the navigation bar  Im trying to get the nav items to highlight based on which div is currently active. p  pI finally settled on the following solution before realizing it doesnt quite cut itp  ul liMooTools handles scrollingli liJquery assigns a current class to any nav item thats clicked, and removes the current class from any other nav item.li ul  pThe problem I now cant create inpage links, because inpage links arent hooked up to the nav in any way. For example, on the home page, try clicking the work or team buttons in the content area  appropriate nav items arent selected, and I dont know how to make that work.p  pMaybe I should add the class assignment via Mootools after the scroll takes effect If you know how, please share p  pOr maybe I should modify the Jquery p  pAny and all solutions welcome Thanksp
Negative 5584 pI have a Core Data application set up with a ListViewController, a DetailViewController and an EditingViewController, where most of the editing occurs.

Your assumption is correct. I am modeling this application on the CoreData Books sample.  I am not using a button, but rather using two images to create a checked and unchecked checkbox.  I added a boolean check to my entity, recreated the header file, and added the header file to my ListViewController. Here is a simplified version of the datamodel header file.p  precodeinterface Patient   NSManagedObject      property nonatomic, retain NSString  location property nonatomic, retain NSNumber  check property nonatomic, retain NSString  lastName  end codepre  pAnd here is my modification of your codep  precode voidtableViewUITableView tableView didSelectRowAtIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath       UITableViewCell cell  [self.tableView cellForRowAtIndexPathindexPath]      NSManagedObject entityObject  [self.fetchedResultsController objectAtIndexPathindexPath]     if [entityObject.check boolValue]          entityObject.check  [NSNumber numberWithBoolYES]         cell.imageView.image  [UIImage imageNamedcheck.png]              else          entityObject.check [NSNumber numberWithBoolNO]         cell.imageView.image  [UIImage imageNameduncheck.png]      codepre  pHowever, this gives me the error Request for member check in something not a structure or union.

Negative 5584 pSo I have a Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.Workbook object. It basically uses a template Excel file to construct itself. The Excel file contains a template column color for the results section, etc. and then the code basically just prints over those template columns, it doesnt actually customize the look of the file itself, only puts the data into it.p  pHowever, this is an issue because after its done, our template accounts for the most POSSIBLE rows it can, but a lot of the times most of the time, we use not even half of them.p  pWhats the easiest way to remove all rows that DO NOT have cell data in them after the file has been created, working directly with the Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.Workbook object.

Negative 5584 pHere is the catch. I have a business object that has a field named codeRegisterDatecode. The business rule as usual says that once it is set, cant be changed.p  pMy first thinking about implementing this field as a property and defining the setter as protected, preventing users from using and setting it after the object is created. But after thinking a while I got me sneaking a business rule in a property accessibility rule.p  pMy second thought was to leave the property setter public, implement an exception when setting it, which makes the business rule pretty explicit. There will be a test case that expect the property to throw an exception every time someone tries to set it.p  pWell, but thats a lot of boilerplate to avoid a behavior, why not making the thing protected after all, avoiding even misuse in other parts of the code But then I wondered, what if another developer accidentally changes the property accessibility and makes it public again and the users of the business object starts using this field violating the business rulep  pWhat is the best approach for this situation How would you solve this issue p

Overriding the codeIsEnabledcode dependency property of the codeScrollViewercode to always return true, or provide some sort of codeStylecode that does not allow for the codeScrollViewercode to become disabled.p  pI know a codeTextBoxcode has an codeIsReadOnlycode property, but this is of no use for many of the other controls I need to resolve this issue for.p  pIs there any way I can go about solving this, in a fairly simple manner simple as in that I can make a style thats applied everywhere, without changing the 200 code files.p  pThanksp  pstrongEDITstrong  Here is the code Im using in a sample project to try to resolve this issue.p  precodeltWindow xClassWPFScrollViewerStyles.MainWindow     xmlnshttpschemas.microsoft.comwinfx2006xamlpresentation     xmlnsMicrosoftWindowsThemesclrnamespaceMicrosoft.Windows.ThemesassemblyPresentationFramework.Aero     xmlnsxhttpschemas.microsoft.comwinfx2006xaml     TitleMainWindow Height350 Width525gt ltWindow.Resourcesgt     ltStyle BasedOnxNull TargetTypexType TextBoxgt         ltSetter PropertyTemplategt             ltSetter.Valuegt                 ltControlTemplate TargetTypexType TextBoxgt                     ltMicrosoftWindowsThemesListBoxChrome xNameBd BorderBrushTemplateBinding BorderBrush BorderThicknessTemplateBinding BorderThickness BackgroundTemplateBinding Background RenderMouseOverTemplateBinding IsMouseOver RenderFocusedTemplateBinding IsKeyboardFocusWithin SnapsToDevicePixelstruegt                         ltScrollViewer xNamePARTContentHost HorizontalScrollBarVisibilityVisible                                        SnapsToDevicePixelsTemplateBinding SnapsToDevicePixels IsEnabledTrue gt                     ltMicrosoftWindowsThemesListBoxChromegt                     ltControlTemplate.Triggersgt                         ltTrigger PropertyIsEnabled Valuefalsegt                             ltSetter PropertyIsEnabled ValueTrue TargetNamePARTContentHost gt                         ltTriggergt                     ltControlTemplate.Triggersgt                 ltControlTemplategt             ltSetter.Valuegt         ltSettergt     ltStylegt ltWindow.Resourcesgt ltGrid IsEnabledFalsegt     ltGrid.ColumnDefinitionsgt         ltColumnDefinition Width100 gt         ltColumnDefinition Width100 gt         ltColumnDefinition Width100 gt     ltGrid.ColumnDefinitionsgt     ltGrid.RowDefinitionsgt         ltRowDefinition Height100 gt         ltRowDefinition Height100 gt         ltRowDefinition Height100 gt     ltGrid.RowDefinitionsgt      ltTextBox xNametxtScroller Width100 Height100 AcceptsReturnTrue VerticalScrollBarVisibilityAuto TextWrappingWrap ScrollViewer.CanContentScrollTruegt         Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

Negative 5584 pI am working on a project that has a simulated robot exploring an unknown, but patterned environment such as an office building by moving around to predefined sensing locations. In other words, at each point the robot must choose a new location to move to from the available visible locations. Our ultimate goal is to have the robot learn how to exploit the patterns in the environment to optimize global exploration time.p  pThe robot chooses which location to move to next by giving it a utility score based on a linear combination of a number of known features about the location such as distance to the point, average distance from the point to all others, area around the point already explored, etc.. My goal is to optimize the weights of this utility function to give the fastest time to explore the whole environment.p  pBecause the score depends on the entire exploration path, I do not want to alter the weights midexploration. To test a combination of weights, I want the simulated robot to run through the entire environment with those weights, and get the resulting score. Therefore, I can create an w1 x n array of data, where w is the number of weights, such as the followingp  precodew1    w2    w3     w4      score 0.23, 4.30, 0.33, 2.001, 17030 1.3, 2.03, 10.1, 0.021, 21983 3.65, 1.1, 5.021, 0.2301, 19508 etc... codepre  pMy question is, what sort of reinforcement learning algorithm would be best for this Most of what I find in the literature and my research has to do with classification, and obviously multivariate regression wont work. I also tried implementing a qlearning algorithm, but this does not really work as there are a variable number of states and actions depending on the path taken and the structure of the environment. What I really want is some sort of structure that takes in row after row of the data, and determines the values of weights and their combinations that maximize the expected score. Any helpideas Thanks.p

Negative 5584 pI am trying to set up an architectural model for a few associated projects which will all be built on an ASP.NET MVC2 .NET 4 framework.  Not sure of the best way to go here, as Im still a bit of an ASP.NET newbie.p  pIll try to lay out a simplified but analogous description of what Im trying to do.  Long story as to why it has to be set up this way, but suffice to say it does.p  pSo Theres one central database and associated data models.  Several different web apps will all use this data.  It consists primarily of information about PEOPLE  names, contact info, age, etc.  There is a simple web app built which accesses this system whose sole purpose is performing CRUD operations on the People data.p  pThere are then multiple additional applications which build on the People data.  For example, theres an application for Group A which deals with salary and benefits.  This information must be contained in a separate database from the People data, on a separate server.  There is also an application for Group B which deals with hobbies and external interests this information will be contained in yet another separate database on a separate server.  You get the picture.  There might be 20 groups, each with their own application on their own server with their own database.  ALL of it will be ASP.NET MVC2 using MSSQL as the database.  Everyone will have access to the .DLL containing the data models and so on for the central data, to include in their Visual Studio solutions.p  pWhat I want is for the code on the applications for the Groups applications to as simply as possible be able to perform something along the lines of JOIN operations via LINQ on the combination of their own data and the central data.  Is this something that has an accepted Best Practice  Is it possible to just include the assembly for the central data models, and then just write code as if everything was part of the same modelp  pMany thanks.p

Negative 5584 pIm trying to bind a listarraylisthashmapetc of custom objects to my form in JSP using Spring. Right now, the controller creates a Map of the two lists Boolean list and custom object list in codereferenceDatacode, and provides it to the form which uses those values to populate the fields. The values are initialized from a MySQL database using Hibernate, and all that works fine. The list is a known length before the form is initialized, so that part is easier. Now what Id like to do is correctly bind those objects in the form, so that when there are changes made, I can detect that in codeonSubmitcode or wherever is appropriate, and update the database accordingly. I cant seem to bind them correctly in the form so that I can see changes made. I tried just using a list of the form fields as the model, but even that wasnt working correctly. Do I just need to inject the list in a particular way Any ideas or examples here Any help would be greatly appreciated.p  pUPDATE At Ralphs request here is the solution I used In my data object class, I lazy loaded a map using codeMapUtils.lazyMapcode, with a String key and other custom object value. The other custom object is just a class that contains codeListltStringgtcode and getterssetters. In the corresponding .jsp file, I just nest several loops to loop through the keys first using codeloop.current.keycode and then codeloop2.current.value.paramsListcode to loop through the values for that key. This was not really what I asked for in my original post, as I was looking for a more general solution, and the lazy loading pointed me in the right direction.p
Negative 5584 pPlease excuse me if you think this is a stupid question for I dont know what I should do now.p  pI have a video file with 1024 x 576 resolution. I tried to play it on a HTC Hero GSM device and it doesnt play. I then tried to play it on Samsung Galaxy Tab and some China made tablet and it plays well. So, I resized the video to 480 x 270 and it works well on HTC. But the video is of bad quality. Thats why I decided to make two videos, for tablet and Herolike devices.p  pThis is the problem. Of the devices I tested, HTC Hero is normalscreen and mdpi, Galaxy tab is largescreen and hdpi. With this, I dont know if the 1024x576 video doesnt play on Hero because of its normal screen or because of its density. Same also for the galaxy tab.p  pI ask now, what could be the reason for the Hero to not play 1024x576 video Is it because it has small screen or because it is mdpip  pI ask this because there are devices that are normal screen but hdpi. And I would like to load the 1024 x 576 video with this kind of device.p  pI hope you understand my problem. Thanks in advance.p

Negative 5584 pstrongHeres the storystrong Ive created an application that starts at boot time and perform some action at specified interval. To achieve that Im creating a service that uses an codeAlarmManagercode to create repeating event which is then handled by codeBroadcastReceivercode which does the heavy work. When the service is destroyed user choose to exit the application the event has to be cancelled, so the service has to keep reference to the same codePendingIntentcode that was used to start it.p  pstrongThe problemstrong Service has to call codestartForegroundcode to ensure it doesnt die so it can maintain the reference to codePendingIntentcode. The notification appears all the time in the status bar and users find it annoying to be honest, me too.p  pstrongWhat nextstrong Ideally Im looking for solution which will keep the icon in the status bar, but wont display in the dragdown list. This way the user will know its running and wont be annoyed by waste of space.p  pstrongFew guessesstrong Maybe its possible to restore the reference in service, when its recreated If so, how This way I could avoid using codestartForegroundcode. But still, how to get the icon into statusbarp  pemOr maybe someone has a better solutionemp
Negative 5584 pIm programming a quadrotor helicopter drone to chase a moving ground target automatically using image processing. The hardware Im working with is pretty limited, so in order to make my automatic commands account for the drones velocity it doesnt know when its moving I have to manually track my targets relative position over time which can be roughly translated into the drones movement.p  pSo heres what I have in that regardp  precodeint lastX  TargetsLastPositionXcoord int lastY  TargetsLastPositionYcoord int nowX  TargetsCurrentPositionXcoord int nowY  TargetsCurrentPositionYcoord  int speedModX  float60  abslastXabsnowX  60.0f  Image dimension is 120 int speedModY  float73  abslastYabsnowY  73.0f  Other dimension is 146  changePitchnowX  6060.0f1  speedModX changeRollnowY  7373.0f1  speedModY codepre  pThe function changePitch and the others like it cause the next command sent to the drone to include a Pitch change of the specified percentage of the preset maximum tilt. So, Im telling the drone to tilt an amount directly related to the targets distance from the center of the screen then Im throwing in a multiplier based on where the target moved the distance between the targets last spot and its current spot.p  pThis is my intention anyways this code only seems to be helping a little bit, and other factors such as air flow and mechanical imbalance it isnt the most highquality equipment out there may be interfering, leaving me to simply see what I want to see.p  pIs the method Im using to account for the drones velocity correct, andor is there a better way to handle thisp  pEDIT calculation of speedModX and speedModY was changed, previous form had unwanted results under some circumstances. New formula correctly creates a modifier based on the difference between the targets previous distance from the origin and the targets current distance from the origin.p

I only used dictionaries because I need to access data based on an index. As far as Im concerned the compiler should get rid of the structures and access the values directly.

Negative 5584 pI would like to give a clear picture of the problem I am facing.p  pstrongScenario Constructionstrongp  pI have a MFCC generator block which gets the speech samples from the user and generates a rectangular matrix say A of the order m x n ,whose elements are the Cesptral CoefficientsMFCC. Now, suppose I maintain a database which are previously stored containing the user speech signal. Through an LPC filter I generate the speech sample and then direct it to the MFCC generator block, with a constraint that I dont give the entire samples from the database for the filter to generate the speech signal. Rather I give a part of the speech sample. Now this predicted speech signal will be now directed towards the MFCC generator block to generate the predicted signals Cepstral coefficients which again turns out to be another rectangular matrix say B of the same order m x n. Then I use a matrix norm along with a heuristically chosen threshold to compare two matricesfind the error and authenticate the user. If it fails, the input speech samples for the prediction is linearly increased and again the constraint is checked.p  pstrongAn insight into matrix A,B as defined before.strongp  pThe rows of the matrix represents the number of coefficients to be generated per speech frame. The columns are the concatenation of coefficients of all the frames for the entire speech sample. A and B have the same setting.  During MFCC generation we make use of a window of fixed size, operate on the samples under the window which yields coefficients for MFCC for that frame and then slide the window such that the slide steps are less than the window size, ie every successive windows overlap.p  pstrongQuestionstrongp  pI have seen this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6932096matchingtwoseriesofmfcccoefficientsMatching two series of Mfcc coefficientsa link. I found it somewhat useful. Yet, I have a few concerns to raise in regards to the problem that I just defined. Even when an authenticated user speak  utters the exact word that is stored in the database it is not necessary that MFCC  positions of each element in the matrix should be in exact match with the one that is generated during prediction.If both the rectangular matrix is converted into a vector, there may be a time delay between the samples. If so, the norms defined in the link I mentioned neednt work out even for an authenticated user. How do I fix it Is there any other forms of solving the above problem.p  pThank you.p

Negative 5584 pIm using Oracle SQL Developer version 3.0.04 to interface with an 11g database over a VPN to my company server. Ive noticed that after killing a task via the Task Progress window, it does not actually kill the task outright. Ive read in some forums that what is going on is that Oracle is trying to roll back the changes made by the procedure Im calling, but I cant imagine its taking more than 10 minutes to roll back to my last commit after 5 minutes of run time. This leads me to believe that it is continuing to run anyway.p  pI can message the DBA to kill my session, which frees up the lock on the tables the process was using as well as the source code of the package so I can edit it again, but this is not an optimal solution.

Negative 5584 pIve got a multiFragment ABS fragment activity with tabs and a ViewPager working pretty well, but for the actual functionality of my application, I need to be able to get hold of the fragments and communicate with them. In order to be able to call findFragmentById, the fragments need IDs, which if I understand correctly requires that they either have a codeltfragmentcode tag or be created by a FragmentTransaction. The TabsAdapterViewPager code Im using creates the fragments from a Fragment class using Fragment.instantiate, which doesnt allow for setting an ID.p  pSo, any ideas for how to use a  tag with a ViewPager, or use a FragmentTransaction to create the tab fragments I could implement my own idfragment mapping within my TabsAdapter pretty easily, but Id rather use a standard mechanism if I can.p

Negative 5584 pHi noticed some code in our application when I first started Java programming.  I had noticed it created a dialog from a separate thread, but never batted an eye lid as it seemed to work.  I then wrapped this method up through my code to display dialogs.p  pThis is as followsp  precodepublic class DialogModalVisibleThread         extends Thread      private JDialog jDialog     public DialogModalVisibleThreadJDialog dialog, String dialogName          this.setNameSet   dialogName   Visable         jDialog  dialog           Override     public void run         jDialog.setVisibletrue        jDialog.requestFocus       codepre  pstrongUsagestrongp  precodeWarnUserDifferenceDialog dialog  new WarnUserDifferenceDialog tableDifferenceCache.size  DialogModalVisibleThread dmvt  new DialogModalVisibleThread dialog, Warn User About Report Diffs dmvt.start codepre  pNow, as far as I am now aware, you should never create or modify swing components from a separate thread.  All updates must be carried out on the Event Dispatch Thread.  Surely this applies to the above codep  pa hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiEventdispatchingthread relnofollowEDT on WikiPediaap  pHowever, the above code has worked.  p  pBut lately, there have been countless repaint issues.  For example, click on a JButton which then calls DialogModalVisibleThread to display a dialog.  It caused buttons alongside the clicked button not to redraw properly.  p  pThe repaint problem is more frequent on my machine and not the other developers machine.  The other developer has a laptop with his desktop extended onto a 21 monitor  the monitor being his main display.  He is running Windows 7 with Java version 1.6.027.p  pI am running on a laptop with Windows 7 and Java version 1.6.024.  I have 2 additional monitors with my desktop extended onto both.p  pIn the meantime I am going to upgrade to Java 1.6 update 27.  p  pI wondered if the above code could cause repaint problems or are there any other people out there with related paint issues  p  pAre there any easy ways to diagnose these problemsp  pThanksp

Negative 5584 pI recently implemented a hrefhttpthesassway.comintermediateresponsivewebdesigninsassusingmediaqueriesinsass32this techniquea with SASS 3.2 using codecontentcode blocks on a project Ive been working on, and Ive just gotten to the point where I need to include support for older browsers such as IE7 and 8.p  pExamplep  precode.overview    padding 0 0 19px    include respondtomediumscreens      paddingtop 19px    mediumscreens    include respondtowidescreens      paddingtop 19px    mediumscreens  codepre  pThey both dont support media queries, and Ive often handled this in the past by serving up all styles to these browsers when I had my media queries separated into separate partial files such as 320.scss, 480.scss and in my IE stylesheet loading them like sop  precodeimport 320.scss import 480.scss etc. codepre  pWhich would load all styles, and always assign IE7  8 a 940px or whatever the max width is layout and styles. By nesting styles in SASS 3.2 inline like this, it eliminates the need for separate partial stylesheets, but totally screws up how I load styles for IE.p  pAny ideas or solutions on how to combat this I could use a polyfill such as respond.js to force IE to use media queries, but would prefer to just serve up a nonflexible site to IE.p  pAny ideas on either how to best organize these files, or a better solutionp

Negative 5584 pPython doctests associate simple tests with the source code in Python they are in the function documentation.  a hrefhttpdocs.python.orglibrarydoctest.html relnofollowMore info and examples herea.p  pIs there anything similar for Clojurep  pI am aware of unit tests with codeclojure.testcode, but looking for something more closely integrated with the source typically unit tests are in different files here I want to have the test inside the codedefncode.p  pSearching around I found a hrefhttpsgithub.comKoboldcljdoctest relnofollowthisa, but it seems very unlispy the tests are in actual text, like Python  surely a macro that extends codedefncode would be preferable.p  pOr perhaps there is some other way to solve the general problem, which is that I have some tests generally simple things that demonstrate basic properties of the function that would be better included with the documentation I am using a hrefhttpfogus.mefunmarginalia relnofollowmarginaliaa than in separate unit test files.p  pemupdateem  Heres an example I have a function that calculates the manhattan distance in pixels from a rectangle of pixels to the centre of the image.  That sounds simple, but is complicated by things like the difference in meaning of centre for images with odd or even numbers of pixels on sides, or which part of the block you measure from.  So I had to write some tests just to get the code straight.  And now I look at the docs and really it would be best if the docs included those tests because they explain better than words what the function does...p

Negative 5584 pI am a developer of a hrefhttpwaveframework.com relnofollowWave Frameworka, a lightweight framework that includes a number of functionality that makes it easier to deploy APIs and serve resources dynamically.p  pOne of those features is ondemand image editing. For example, on my server I have this filep  pa hrefhttpwww.waher.netwresourcesimageslogo.png relnofollowhttpwww.waher.netwresourcesimageslogo.pngap  pBut in my HTML, I load my image from a URL like thisp  pa hrefhttpwww.waher.netwresourcesimages160x160amplogo.png relnofollowhttpwww.waher.netwresourcesimages160x160amplogo.pngap  pThis 160x160amplogo.png file does not actually exist and the only file that exists is logo.png. Every HTTP request is routed to PHP and parameters in the file URL are parsed in order to apply additional functionality, like picture resolution. p  pWhy is this useful If my system has a large number of user avatars and my design changes, I can easily change the avatar picture URLs and everything works as expected. I never have to regenerate all the avatars of all my users, especially of those users that do not exist in my system anymore and just waste resources.p  pBut heres my problem, if I want to implement Nginx to serve static files on my server, my system does not work. This is because Nginx will attempt to load static files itself and throws a 404 Not Found message if picture was not found. I assume that the same is true with Apache and Squid.p  pOne of my clients specifically requested that they wish to serve images and resources through Nginx instead, but they would still like the dynamic images for the ease of development and design.p  pIs it possible to tell Nginx or Squid to send the request to PHP, if the image file itself is not found, get the dynamic image from PHP and then send it to a user through Nginx And at the same time always serving it from Nginx cache in any subsequent request to the same filep  pI want to have the flexibility of dynamically loaded image files, but also have the speed of Nginx when serving image files. Is something like this possible Do I need to set specific file headers in PHP that allow for this I already set cache and expire headers.p  pThank youp

Negative 5584 pI created an app in which there are two fragments and in both fragments there are listviews. The first listview in the fragment1 is getting scrolled and the items are also getting highlighted. But in the second fragment, the listview is not scrolled and even the items are not getting highlighted. Can someone tell me what is the problem The thing here is I just checked this with putting the same fragment class to both fragments in xml. Either they both should work or the both shouldnt because one is no different from the other.

Negative 5584 pIm building a simulation in Java. So, Ill break my simulation into two partsp  p1 The simulation enginep  p2 The simulation modelp  pBasically I want a little help tipsadvice about how to split it up i.e. what goes where.p  pSo Im thinking that the engine will keep track of time. It will listen for events and when events arrive it will update the state of the simulation  Im building a discrete event simulation. The simulation model will have the GUI and it will get the logic and data from the actual engine. Im thinking that the model will provide the actual events as input to the engine. Ive been thinking about a car analogy where the engine is the body of the car and the model the driver. So I want it to behave like the drivermodel telling the carengine what to do i.e. when to turn when to break and what speed to go at etcp  pDo you think Im tackling this in the right way I can sense that I sound a little confusing and not very clear. So Ill just clarify that what Im looking for is just some input to how I should split this up and what the responsibility of engine and model should actually be.p  pAlso, I was wondering, if I were to implement the MVC design pattern, how would that fit in with the way Im trying to break it upp  pEDITp  pBy model I mean that I want the simulation to have a set of specific rules which the engine then follows. As Im building a road traffic simulator, the rules could be like, the distribution of cars, driver profiles, what cars may and may not do  e.g. stop for red light etc. So the model is like the brain of the simulation if you get what I mean, and then the engine being the actual simulation of the set of rules specified by the model. I hope this makes more sense. p

have a problem when my war file is deployed into the jboss deploy folder i.e. deployment is failing, I am sure that this is some what related to configuration and classpath issues but I am unable to figure out the exact piece which is causing the problem. p  pHere is the proceduremethod I followed. Actually Im building the .WAR file by using ant build script In eclipse. Finally my war file will not contain lib folder which means no .jars in it internally, thats the requirement as .WAR file shall not be heavy weighted But every .jar including servletapi.jar file that is needed to .WAR is made available in the jboss classpath configurations but still Im getting the Errors and Exceptions while deploying. Please find the log for more details server.log info is pasted above.p  pNOTEIn my ant build script Im not compilinglinking any classes anything internally. What I mean to say is Even for ant file .jars are made available through ant classpath.p  pHere is an abstract of my build.xmlp  precodelttarget namecompile dependsclean, initgt     ltjavac destdirrds.build debugtrue srcdirrds.srcgt     ltjavacgt lttargetgt  lttarget namewar dependscompile, doTestLevel, doProdLevelgt   ltwar destfilerds.dist.binRDSGUIWeb.war gt     ltfileset dirprojectRootDirWebContentgt             ltinclude namegt         ltexclude nameWEBINFlib gt     ltfilesetgt     ltclasses dirrds.build gt   ltwargt lttargetgt codepre  pUPDATE I tried to run the jboss by removing servletapi.jar from its classpath, At this time Ill be getting something like application listener of class com.icesoft.faces.util.event.servlet.ContextEventRepeater not instantiated. In both ways either including servletapi.jar or not Im unable to succeed. Thats the reson I approached stackoverflow.p

Negative 5584 pOne week ago my professor talked about garbage collection and its responsiveness. Basically he said that if you use garbage collection you will always have a very small delay before the code will be executed.p  pNow you can say that the user will not recognize the delay because it is very small.p  pI am working on a game engine for my final bachelor exam and I am currently deciding which scripting language I will choose for my engine.p  hr  pNow I have the following situation.  Lets say you create a game with a first person camera. And lets also say that the gamelogic is written in a language with a garbage collection.p  pstrongWouldnt this imply that the user will encounter more input lag than playing a game where the gamelogic is written in a language without garbage collectionstrongp  pNow input lag is very difficult to predict because there are so many systems that will produce a delay.p  pfor example codeinput gt gamecode executing gt  graphics rendering gt rendering on the screencode.p  pstrongIs it roughly predictable how much delay I will have If I use a language with gc vs a language without gcstrong  codelt1ms, lt10ms lt100mscodep

How to do that properlyli liI want to initialize Spring ACL custom tables during system startup, but the SQL script file does not seem to be good solution because if I use different database for production and functional testing, the different SQL dialect does not allow me to execute script properly on both engines e.g. when using MySQL and HSQL.li ol  pAt first I tried to use codeServletListenercode that during servlet initialization check the db and adds the necessary data and schema, but this does not work for integration tests because there are no servlet involved at all.p  pWhat I want to achieve is the Spring bean  that is launched after the JPA has initialized all entity tables, insert all startup data using injected DAOs and somehow creates the Spring ACL schema. Then  I want the bean to be removed from IoC because I simly dont need it anymore. Is it possiblep  pOr is there any better way of doing thisp

What Im trying to do is to change a scope property of the directive codeenvatocode from the directive codeitemscode. Because I have a iteration and I want to know when its done so I can do another operation on the appended DOM elements during that iteration.p  pFor instance lets say I will have the codescope.swipecode defined inside the directive codeenvatocode, and watch it for changes. In the directive codeitemscode, I will watch when the codengrepeatcode is done and then change the above defined scope property codescope.swipecode. This will trigger the change inside the directive codeenvatocode, and now I will know that I can do my operation.p  pI hope that Im clear enough, if not I could try having more code or Ill try being more specific. How could I achieve what I just described above p  pstrongEDIT strong I do know that using  codeconsole.logangular.elementelement.parent.scopecode inside the directive codeitemscode will give me the scope of the codeenvatocode directive, but I was wondering if there was a better way of doing it.p

Negative 5584 pIm trying to find out what the valid options for EF DataAnnotations when applying the code[DataTypeDataType.Something]code attribute.  Looking through the MSDN docs I can only seem to find the valid ENUM values, but cant find any definitions for what qualifies for a given data type.p  pSpecifically, Im looking at the codeDataType.PhoneNumbercode Im not sure that my current DB spec supports this since I cant find any input on what its looking for if this is applied.p  pSo my specific question is what are the acceptable values for a codeDataType.PhoneNumbercode with bonus points for a link that specifies the values for mostall of the different DataType enum values.p  pFOR CLARIFICATION...p  pWhen I say acceptable values Im wondering are all three 5555555555, 5555555555, and 555 5555555 valid or only a subset  Is there other acceptable values Just not sure here. Also, this will NEVER see anything international so my only concern is the US standard 10 digits.p  pAlso, just to avoid some I believe unnecessary explanation...Im aware that codeDataType.Somethingcode is an enum and doesnt hold the values itself...instead Im wondering what the code that uses the enum considers valid.p  pa hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.componentmodel.dataannotations.datatype.aspx relnofollowMSDN Ref for DataType enumap

Negative 5584 pI managed to write code through a tutorial that runs for a simple crossword puzzle.  Im pretty new at Python so I mistakenly used some code from 2.7 and some from 3.2  I think I managed to fix that, but now my goal is to make it more pleasing to the eye. At this point my words just appear on my Python Interpreter but I was hoping somebody could let me know what I would have to do on tkinter to get it to look like a proper crossword puzzle i.e. have the canvas draw a grid for my code so each word would appear in its own little set of squares.  How would I go around that  Below is the code I used for puzzle and the words their lengths that Im trying to fit into the grid. I was suggested to make an entry widget for each word but I have no clue how to do that.

Negative 5584 pIm developing a game where there are processes created and they create their own timer. Once the timer is finished, a request process finished is dispatched to the server. Sometimes the problem is that the timer finishes earlier and because in my test environment the client and the server are on the same machine, everything happens very fast and the server fails its check if the process has expired.p  pThis is because the actionscripts Timer dispatched timer complete a little bit earlier. Now, I saw a lot of articles regarding the problem, including a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5955044howtomakeatimeraccurateflashactionscript30this onea, but none of these seem to answer my question. I dont want to create a timer that is accurate, but to create a timer that never dispatches earlier, no matter if the client has ran at slightly higher FPS rates while its been running. How do I achieve that Thank youp

Negative 5584 pI recently acquired some domains for code.netcode and code.comcode and found that Google apparently found them within days although I did not link them from anywhere.p  pSo I wondered if there was a way for regular organizations or people not related to registrars to programmatically and systematically find out about newly registered domains, or if Google was just crawling the sites nearly in realtime upon looking for them or even polling for particular domains, or doing DNS zone transfers.p  pAnd if so, how much would access to such an API cost, e.g. for code.comcode or code.netcode p  pFYI, I did not use any Googleoperated devices re Android nor Google DNS at that time either.p  pHowever, it might well be that there are DNS zone transfers between name server operators and Google... who knows.p

Negative 5584 pI hope this is a legitimate question.p  pI have a very large dataset for me. I have a 639 mb table with over 8 million rows. I will be mainly reading this data and the data should be essentially persistent it wouldnt ever really change.p  pUpon realizing I have over 8 million rows I began to wonder if the mySql solution I started with would still be optimal. This got me looking at Nosql and the different subsets of it cassandra, mongodb, postgresql These are all subsets of nosql, rightp  pSo now after lots of searching through guides on google and watching a few presentations and reading a few powerpoints Im basically just wondering if things like cassandra and mongodb are essentially the same. If the sql alternatives are basically all nosql. When is the dataset so to big that a nosql solution becomes more optimal than the traditional RDBMS solution  Other than just large datasets are there any other reasons really to necessarily use nosql alternatives other than for performance reasons And generally Im just wondering what sql alternatives are optimal for large datasets and scalability, what qualifies a large dataset and what are the leading industry standards in dealing with these large datasetsp  pIm really interested in what DBAs might have to say about this as well as web developers. Thankyou so much for any helpful tidbits of information, I really appreciate it even if youre just pointing me towards a resource.p  pstrongEDIT This question is on hold because Many good questions generate some degree of opinion based on expert experience, but answers to this question will tend to be almost entirely based on opinions, rather than facts, references, or specific expertise. I understand where thats coming from. My hope though was to get some insight into what might be the industry standard. Like maybe people will disagree and nitpick on which type of DB to use in this specific instance, but surely there are well known standards which if met will qualify the use of either mysql or nosql. And just as likely there are substandards that would qualify the use of either cassandra or mongodb. I was hoping someone with years of experience in the field could either chime in or point me to a resource I could use to have a better grasp in distinguishing between these. I understand if this isnt possible but I hope it is. Cheers, Stephen.strongp

Negative 5584 pIts supposed to be a very common workflow, so I am surprised that neither C gridview or DevExpress provides an easy way to do it.  p  pExamplebr MyColumn is a field of combobox type column. When a user tries to edit value in this field, he will have to choose a value in the dropdown list. When the grid has 1 row, he can choose from value A, value B or value C. If the user has chosen value A in the 1st row, then in the 2nd row the available values for MyColumn become value B and value C.  p  pCurrently I am doing it in a dirty way with DevExpress , where I calculate the combobox repository modify RepositoryItemComboBox.Items property everytime after a delete, insert or modify operation, and in the CustomRowCellEdit event handler I assign the updated repository to the column. The code is very convoluted and brittle.  p  pupdate I just came up with a better example of a use case Say that the grid asks the user to select his 5 most favorite US states. So the column State is a combobox type column that initially has a list of 50 states. If the user selects CA for the 1st row, then in the 2nd row he will have only 49 states available to select. In this case, you always want values to be unique in each row or it would not make sense.p

Negative 5584 pI want to draw Text on a canvas. To do the rotation I used the following code from a hrefhttpsforums.embarcadero.comthread.jspamessageID440010 relnofollowhttpsforums.embarcadero.comthread.jspamessageID440010ap  precodebm is a TImage     a  45 c bm.Canvas CurrentM  c.Matrix aradiana m.m11 cosa m.m12sina m.m130 m.m21sina m.m22cosa m.m230 m.m310       m.m320      m.m331 c.setmatrixM  c.BeginScene     c.filltextrectf100,100,5000,5000, test rotated string, false,1,[],ttextalign.taLeading,ttextalign.taLeading c.EndScene codepre  pThis works fine.  I have set my rectangles right and bottom to 5000 so that I do not have to be worried about my rectangle being to small.p  pThe problem is that I now want to change my TextAlignment properties.  So to draw text from right to left I had to adjust my rectangle and then draw it in the following wayp  precodec.BeginScene     c.filltextrectf100  5000,100,100,5000, test rotated string, false,1,[],ttextalign.taTrailing,ttextalign.taLeading c.EndScene codepre  pSo basically I moved the x value of my rectangles TopLeft and moved it back 5000 again I am using 5000 to make sure my text fit.   I then set the x value of my rectangles bottom right to where the x value was in my previous examples rectangles TopLeft. This work fine for a 0 degree rotation, but as soon as I change the degrees I does not draw my text at the correct place.  I assume this is because the text will rotate around the rectangles TopLeft position which is altered to make the text write from right to left. p

Negative 5584 pI came across a a hrefhttpquaxio.comtron relnofollowwebsitea today. It was a challenge of some developers about making the smallest game possible with certain requirements, and they released the final code of unbelievable size of 219 bytes and runnable on Chrome 17 one of the requirements. I tried to explore the code with the explanation provided from the site and do researches on codes I didnt comprehend. However, the code was packed too heavily to my knowledge, so I am seeking for some helps.p  pHere is the code, after beautifiedp  precodeltbody idb onkeyupeevent onload     zc.getContext2d     z.fillRects0,0,n150,x11325     setInterval         0ltxn         ampxltnn         ampz[x[1,n,1,n][e.whichamp3]]1         z.clearRectxn,xn,1,1,s         b.innerHTMLGameOvers     ,9gt ltcanvas idcgt codepre  pThe game is named Tron, and just like classic snake game without apple.p  pAnyway, here are my questionsp  pstrong1 How can they select element with id c without using codegetElementByIdcode rather than a simple codeccodestrongp  pLook at the bottom of the code, there is a canvas with codeltcanvas idcgtcode. I understand that advanced browsers will automatically fix the quotes codecode for the codeidccode. However, when a function is called in codeonloadcode event, it assigns codez  c.getContent2dcode and directly refers to the canvas without even applying anything such as codedocument.getElementByIdcode. Also the same when they referred to codeltbody idbgtcode. How is that possible Under which circumstances am I able to do similarlyp  pstrong2 Will replacing parameters of a functions by quick assigning variables affect the function at all If it does, how will it be calculatedstrongp  pParticularly, take a look of the third linep  precodez.fillRects  0, 0, n  150, x  11325 codepre  pI understand to the most basic level, codefillRectcode requires 4 parameters codefillRectxcor, ycor, width, heightcode. However, the code above produces a rectangle 150x150. First of all, I read the description and they claimed that by default, the code would produce a rectangle 300x150, so I assumed that the assigning short functions would actually assign nothing to the parameters of the parent function. I did a test, and replaced coden  150code by coden  200code. Weirdly enough, it produces a rectangle 200x150, so once again I agree that coden  150code did assign code150code to that slot. Hence, the code above can be written asp  precodez.fillRect0, 0, 150, 11325 codepre  pHowever, another problem comes. Why isnt its height 11325px but 150px instead I thought it was reset to default because 11325 excessed the handling of browsers, so I changed it to 500 instead and it produced the same problem.p  pSo generally, when you do short assigning inside a function for instance codesomeCustomFunction.calls  1code, what really happens there If nothing happens, why did the rectangle in the example above changed its size when replacing coden  200code but not when codex  200codep  pemAdditional question this question is not the question I am really into, because it is too personal, but I would love to know. The source states that x is going to be the trons position, and is set to 11325 11325  75 x 75  75  center of the grid, how does this kind of onenumberrepresentsposition workemp  pstrong3 What in the world does it meanstrongp  pThis is the most headache part to me, because the author packed it too smartly.p  precodeampz[x[1,n,1,n][e.whichamp3]]1 codepre  pI broke it up, and figured that it was actually z[]1 in order to check the condition for the later code code operators. But firstp  pstrongWhat does code1code dostrongp  pSome people a hrefhttpwww.reddit.comrjavascriptcommentsraee3tronin226bytesofjs relnofollowcommenteda on the project and said it could be replaced by codecode. I think of it as a bitwise AND operator, but what does it have to do with codecodep  pAnd nextp  pstrongHow did they use code[e.whichamp3]code together with the preset array to filter keystroke i, j, k, l too effectivelystrongp  pI notice the array has the length of 4, which is the length of the keys needs filtering. Also, pressing another key rather than i, j, k, l also works. It leads me to believe that the codeamp3code does something in filtering the 4 keys, but I dont know how.p  pThose are all I have to ask. The short but complicated code really excites me, and I really appreciate any help in understanding the code further.p

Negative 5584 pIm not finding a reference to Last so Ill ask what I hope is a fairly simple need to fulfill.  I have objects in a core data entity.

I know core data stores its own unique incrementing key but I dont know how to reference it.  I need to check to see if the odometer reading the user is trying to enter is less then the last one entered or varies beyond normal bounds to check for user input error before saving a new object and present an alertview if so.p  pI cant look for MAX because the user may have made an erroneous high entry prior. but I can deal with that issue separately once the user has determined he has made an invalid entry somewhere that needs to be addressed and dealt with accordingly.p  pThanks.p

Negative 5584 pHi weve been working with Adobe DPS for a while now and we just started using html to support some more advanced interactions. So we inserted the html amp assets locally into a webview. p  pWhen updating these files the webview doesnt update. It looks like the webview is caching everythinghtmlcssjsimages extremely hard. p  pIs there any way to prevent these webviews from caching just for development purposesp
Negative 5584 pWeve added two extensions to HtmlHelper codeContentcode and codeBlockcode.  codeContentcode allows consumers to create codeHtmlStringscode from razor code.  codeBlockcode attempts to allow users to create html blocks with header and content sections.  Im trying to understand why the the coderazorContentcode parameter doesnt compile inside of a using block.  Id like to preserve the use of a using block because I think it looks very clean.  Is there a way to make this compile without changing the second argument on codeBlockcode to codeHtmlStringcodep  pRazorp  precode uses of Html.Content compiles as expected  Html.Contentltspangtfooltspangt      IHtmlString htmlString  Html.Contentltspangtbarltspangt  htmlString    ltspangtheaderltspangt does not compile     expected markup    ltdiv classheadergt       ltspangtheaderltspangt   ltdivgt   ltdiv classcontentgt       ltspangtcontentltspangt   ltdivgt   using Html.Blockltspangtheaderltspangt      ltspangtcontentltspangt  codepre  pExtensionsp  precodepublic static class HtmlHelperExtensions      public static IHtmlString Contentthis HtmlHelper htmlHelper, Funcltobject, HelperResultgt razorContent              var content  razorContentnull         return content           public static IDisposable Blockthis HtmlHelper htmlHelper, Funcltobject, HelperResultgt razorContent              var content  razorContentnull         return new MyHtmlBlockhtmlHelper, content       codepre  pMyHtmlBlock p  precodepublic class MyHtmlBlock  IDisposable      private readonly TextWriter writer     private readonly TagBuilder contentTag      public MyHtmlBlockHtmlHelper htmlHelper, IHtmlString header              this.writer  htmlHelper.ViewContext.Writer          var headerTag  new TagBuilderdiv         headerTag.AddCssClassheader         headerTag.InnerHtml  header.ToHtmlString          this.contentTag  new TagBuilderdiv         this.contentTag.AddCssClasscontent          this.writer.WriteheaderTag         this.writer.Writethis.contentTag.ToStringTagRenderMode.StartTag          public void Dispose              this.writer.Writethis.contentTag.ToStringTagRenderMode.EndTag       codepre

Negative 5584 pI port some of my apps with the new Xcode to 64bit, Im now also use asset catalog to select the launch image.p  pProblem is that when submitting one of the targets to Apple I get this in email Phone 5 Optimization Requirement  Your binary is not optimized for iPhone 5. New iPhone apps and app updates submitted targeting iOS 6 and above must support the 4inch display on iPhone 5 and must include a launch image with the 568h size modifier immediately following the  portion of the launch images filename. Launch images must be PNG files and located at the toplevel of your bundle, or provided within each .lproj folder if you localize your launch imagesp  pThe problem wasnt there when I used Xcode 4.6 moreover, the app works pretty well on iPhone 5 with iOS7 and in simulator on iPhone 5 screen using iOS6 amp iOS 7.

The rest of the program is provided, and can be assumed to be correct.p  pHere Im getting the x and y index of the current thread and using those to get the pixel in the image arrays Im dealing with in the current thread.  Then I calculate the absolute difference, wait for all the threads to finish calculating that, then if the current thread is within the block in the image we care about the absolute difference is added to the sum in global memory with an atomicAdd to avoid a collision during write.p  precodeglobal void gpuCounterKernelpixel cudacurBlock, pixel cudarefBlock, uint32 cudaSAD,  uint32 cudaBlocksize                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         int idx  blockIdx.x  blockDim.x  threadIdx.x                                                                                                                                                                                          int idy  blockIdx.y  blockDim.y  threadIdx.y                                                                                                                                                                                          int id  idx  cudaBlocksize  idy                                                                                                                                                                                     int AD  abs cudacurBlock[id]  cudarefBlock[id]                                                                                                            syncthreads                                                                                                                                                                                       if idx lt cudaBlocksize ampamp idy lt cudaBlocksize                                                                                                                                                                                       atomicAdd cudaSAD, AD                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           codepre  pAnd this is how Im setting up the grid and blocks for the kernelp  precodeint gridsizeX    Blocksize2                                                                                                                                                                                                 int gridsizeY    Blocksize2                                                                                                                                                                                                      int blocksizeX   Blocksize4                                                                                                                                                                                                      int blocksizeY   Blocksize4 dim3 blocksInGridgridsizeX, gridsizeY                                                                                                                                                                                      dim3 threadsInBlockblocksizeX, blocksizeY                                                                                                                                                                               codepre  pThe given program calculates the SAD on the CPU as well and compares our result from the GPU with that one to check for correctness.

Negative 5584 pI have two spring projects both using maven. The first is a client for some api and the second is a console program that, in part, utilises that client.p  pI have packaged up the client into a jar and referenced it in the pom for the console program.p  pI have managed to get this working, just about, but I am not very happy with the solutionp  pstrong1strong The first problem I ran into was that each of the context xml files were named applicationContext.xml. Therefore, I couldnt work out any way to reference the context file in the client, without renaming it to something else e.g. clientContext.xml. This works but is there any other way to reference it explicitlyp  pstrong2strong The next issue was how to invoke the clientContext.xml from within the console program. To do this, I have added codeltimport resourceosrdClientContext.xmlgtcode to the applicationContext.xml of the console program and this seems to allow it to correctly find all of the defined beans. Im not sure if this is best practice thoughp  pstrong3strong Within clientContext.xml, I need to reference a properties file and so have the line codeltcontextpropertyplaceholder locationclasspathapi.properties gtcode. This works when running the client on its own but appears to get ignored or fails to find the file when running the console program. The api.properties file is in the root of the packaged jar for the client and the jar is in the classpath of the console program. The only workaround I have found is to manually copy the properties file into the console program, at which point it is found without any problem.p  pstrong4strong Both projects have a resources directory with subdirectories dev, beta and prod. This allows me to define different properties depending on the maven profile I want to run against. This works fine for the individual projects but when I package the client, it only includes the properties files for the profile I am running against which makes sense. However, that then means if I run the console project against profile beta, it will still run the client against whatever profile it was packaged against. It would be handy to be able to package all of the properties files and get the client to run in the same profile as whatever is depending on it. Is that possiblea good ideap

Negative 5584 pAre there any dangers in using a quadstore if you intend all your data to be accessible by RDF clientsp  pI ask because to my knowledge a standardscompliant RDF client expects 3 columns of data per tuple. A quadstore, however, introduces a 4th column for the purpose of naming graphs. The graph name is a URI so can be described with its own node in another part of the graph this could contain valuable information such as audit trail, versioning, access rights and so forth.p  pMy concern is that triplestore clients would not be privy to this extra detail as the emlinkem to such data emcouldem be expressed at a metalevel i.e. in the 4th column as opposed to using additional triples.p  pHoping that Im missing something here, as quadstores seem to be the defacto implementation for most RDF stores Sesame, Jena, Virtuoso, etc.p

Negative 5584 pIm working on an iOS augmented reality application. It is locationbased, not markerbased.p  pI use the GPS, compass and accelerometers to get latitude, longitude, altitude and the 3 euler angles yaw, pitch and roll. I know using NSLog that those 6 variables contain valid data.p  pMy application shows some 3d objects over the camera view. It works fine as long as I use everything but the roll angle.p  pIf I add that third angle, the rotation applied to my opengl world is not good. I do it that way in the main OpenGL draw methodp  precodeglRotatefpitch, 1, 0, 0 glRotatefyaw, 0, 1, 0 glRotatefroll, 0, 0, 1 codepre  pI think there is something wrong with this approach but am certainly not a specialist. Maybe I should create some sort of unique rotation matrix rather than 3 different ones p  pMaybe thats not possible easily After all most desktop video games, FPS and the like, just let the user change the yaw and the pitch using the mouse, so only 2 angles, not 3. But unlike the mouse, which is a 2d device, a phone used for augmented reality can move in any angles.p  pBut then again, all AR tutorials I have seen online couldnt handle roll properly. Rolling your phone would either completely mess AR stuff up or do nothing at all, using some rollcompensation strategies.p  pSo my question is, assuming I have my 3 Euler angles using the phone sensors, how should I apply them to my 3d opengl viewp

Negative 5584 pIve been trying to build a ClientServer programme. Once installed on a computer Host, the host should be able to work both as the host and the server seems easy, but thats not all. The programme should be able to work in a network without a physical mediating server that would serve to connect the various hosts running the programme. Each host should be inteligent enough to get the Name and IP of all other hosts in the network running the programme.p  p Loosely put, like how a bluetooth enabled device works to detect other bluetooth enabled devices.p  pThis should be working in all kinds of networks wifi, LAN etc.p  pHow can I implement this.

Negative 5584 pIve been learning RabbitMQ various topologies, however, I couldnt find any reference to dynamic queue creation aka Declare Queue emitted from a producer. The idea would be to create queues dynamically depending on a particular event e.g a HTTP request. The queue would be temporary with a TTL set and named after the event ID. A consumer could then, subscribe to the topic event. and merge all the messages related to it.p  pstrongExamplestrongp  ol liHTTP POST Create user receivedli liproducer creates a queue user.IDli lipush all the subsequent messages concerning the user in his queue e.g Add username, Add email ...li liworker gets assigned to a random queue user. and merges everything into a user accountli liqueue is automatically deleted after the TTL expiredli ol  pNow, is this scenario feasible with RabbitMQ p

Negative 5584 pI have a large number of stored procedures 200 that all collect clinical data and insert the result into a common table.

More accurately the first call in the web browser can take up to 250ms, but subsequent fetches in the web browser, even when using different parameters, are fast.p  pNote that both are tested from the same computer, so I dont think you can blame it on my network speed.p  pNow when adding the roundtrip from the mobile app to my server, such a delay is very noticeable, almost unacceptable.p  pSo my question is what is the cause of this extra slowdown, and is there a way to remedy itp  pMy first guess is that the SSL handshake and verification of Google APIs certificate may be part of the problem, and which may be why the first fetch in the browser is equally slow. But whatever I try, I cant find a way to make it faster in PHP. I have thought of adding an explicit cache for the certificate, I dont even know if that is technically feasible.p  pUpdate demo code youll have to fill in your own API keyp  precodeltphp     input  issetGET[input]  GET[input]  vla     defineAPIKEY, your api key     params  array          input gt input,         types gt regions,         sensor gt false,         language gt nl,         key gt APIKEY,          url  httpsmaps.googleapis.commapsapiplaceautocompletejson . httpbuildqueryparams      Initialize session and set URL.     ch  curlinit     curlsetoptch, CURLOPTURL, url      Set so curlexec returns the result instead of outputting it.     curlsetoptch, CURLOPTRETURNTRANSFER, true      accept any CA     curlsetoptch, CURLOPTSSLVERIFYPEER, false     t  arraymicrotimetrue      Get the response     json  curlexecch         t[]  microtimetrue      close the channel.     curlclosech     echo ltplaintextgt     echo url, n      show benchmark time     printfst0.6fsn, Time, t[sizeoft1]t[0]      show JSON     echo json codepre

Negative 5584 pWhile looking for a container suitable for an application Im building, I ran across documentation for the relatively new C11 container codeunorderedsetcode. Given that my application typically requires only codeinsertcode and codefindcode functions, this class seems rather attractive. Im slightly put off, however, by the fact that codefindcode is O1 amortized, but On worst case  I would be using the function frequently, and it could make or break my application. What causes the spike in complexity Is the likelihood of running into an On search predictablep  pIm relatively new to C read I know the basics well enough, but have a strong math background  feel free to go into detail.p

Negative 5584 pI write code in C. I have been striving to write more testable code but I am a little confused on deciding between writing pure functions that are really good for testing but require smaller functions and hurt readability in my opinion and writing functions that do modify some internal state.p  pFor example all state variables are declared static and hence are private to my modulep  pWhich of this is more testable in your opinionp  precodeint outerAPIbar      Modify internal state    internalfoo   int internalfoo     Do stuff    if internalstatevariable          Do some more stuff      internalstatevariable  false     codepre  pORp  precodeint outerAPIbar      Modify internal state     internalfoointernalstatevariable      This could be another function if repeated many     times in the module    if internalstatevariable           internalstatevariable  false       int internalfoobool arg     Do stuff    if arg          Do some more stuff     codepre  pAlthough second implementation is more testable wrt to internalfoo as it has no sideeffects but it makes bar uglier and requires smaller functions that make it hard for the reader to even follow small snippets as he has to constantly shift attention to different functions.p  pWhich one do you think is better  Compare this to writing OOPS code, the private functions most of the time use internal state and are not pure. Testing is done by setting up internal state on a mock object instance and testing the private function. I am getting a little confused on whether to use or whether to pass in internal state to private functions for the sake of testability p

Negative 5584 pI was reading about floatingpoint NaN values in the Java Language Specification Im boring. A 32bit codefloatcode has this bit formatp  precodeseee eeee emmm mmmm mmmm mmmm mmmm mmmm codepre  pcodescode is the sign bit, codeecode are the exponent bits, and codemcode are the mantissa bits. A NaN value is encoded as an exponent of all 1s and the mantissa bits are not all 0 which would be  infinity. This means that there are lots of different possible NaN values having different codescode and codemcode bit values.p  pOn this, a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavasespecsjlsse8htmljls4.htmljls4.2.3JLS 4.2.3a saysp  blockquote   pIEEE 754 allows multiple distinct NaN values for each of its single and double floatingpoint formats. While each hardware architecture returns a particular bit pattern for NaN when a new NaN is generated, a programmer can also create NaNs with different bit patterns to encode, for example, retrospective diagnostic information.p blockquote  pThe text in the JLS seems to imply that the result of, for example, code0.00.0code, has a hardwaredependent bit pattern, and depending on whether that expression was computed as a compile time constant, the hardware it is dependent on might be the hardware the Java program was compiled on or the hardware the program was run on.

The upper bit of the mantissa is also 1, which for NaNs apparently indicates a quiet NaN as opposed to a signalling NaN a hrefhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiNaNFloatingpointhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiNaNFloatingpointa. The sign bit and the rest of the mantissa bits are 0. The output also indicates that there was no difference between the NaNs generated on my machine and the constant NaNs from the Float and Double classes.p  pMy question is, is that output guaranteed in Java, regardless of the CPU of the compiler or VM, or is it all genuinely unpredictable The JLS is mysterious about this.p  pIf that output is guaranteed for code0.00.0code, are there any arithmetic ways of producing NaNs that have other possibly hardwaredependent bit patterns I know I could use codeintBitsToFloatcodecodelongBitsToDoublecode to encode other NaNs deliberately, but I would like to know if other values can occur from normal arithmetic.p  hr  pA followup question Ive noticed that a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase8docsapijavalangFloat.htmlNaNFloat.NaNa and a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase8docsapijavalangDouble.htmlNaNDouble.NaNa specify their exact bit pattern, but in the source a hrefhttphg.openjdk.java.netjdk8jdk8jdkfiletipsrcshareclassesjavalangFloat.javaFloata, a hrefhttphg.openjdk.java.netjdk8jdk8jdkfiletipsrcshareclassesjavalangDouble.javaDoublea they are generated by 0.00.0.

Negative 5584 pIs there a simplecleanelegant way of having an event client be invoked at the time when it gets connected to an event That is, when the client connects to the event using  such asp  precodesomeEvent  someClient codepre  pIt would be useful if the client could be invoked right away  as if the event had occurred just as the client is connecting. The purpose is to provide the client with the information from the most recent event that has occurred so the client can catch up with the state associated with the event.p  pA concrete example a store has some tickertape style signs in its windows. Each signs code gets an event from the stores system telling it what to display e.g., whats on sale at the moment. Each sign displays the same thing. When each sign gets turned on, it wants to know what the latest on sale event was. If the store operator enters the sale info into the store system first and the on sale event goes out  to nobody, and then turns on the signs, the signs must somehow ask for the latest events on sale info. It seems cleaner to have the latest event resent to a sign when it connects as an event clientreceiver and thereby have just one mechanism in the sign.p  pIs there a way to connect a client has registered hook to the event so that custom code would be executed In this case the code would send an event to only the new client so the client gets caught up. For example, override the  operator used to register a client How to do so is not clear to me...p  pThanks for your ideas.p

Negative 5584 pSo I looked around at the other questions that are related to this and they suggested breakpoints to track what is coming up nil. From what I could find the image is never being loaded. The custom cell looks like it was being loaded but when it comes to the UIImage that is in the cell its causing the error by the image not loading. Here is the code. I am not quite sure why the image isnt being loaded. I have tried a few different ways to initialize the image and nothing so far has fixed it.p  precodeclass MenuViewController UIViewController, UICollectionViewDataSource, UICollectionViewDelegate      override func viewDidLoad              super.viewDidLoad          Do any additional setup after loading the view         view.backgroundColor  UIColorpatternImage UIImagecontentsOfFile behindalertview.png            Variables     var menuImagesArray  [MyProfileIcon.png]       Data Source Protocol     func numberOfSectionsInCollectionViewcollectionView UICollectionView gt Int              return 1           func collectionViewcollectionView UICollectionView, numberOfItemsInSection section Int gt Int              return menuImagesArray.count           func collectionViewcollectionView UICollectionView, cellForItemAtIndexPath indexPath NSIndexPath gt UICollectionViewCell              var menuCell MenuCollectionViewCell  collectionView.dequeueReusableCellWithReuseIdentifierMenuCell, forIndexPath indexPath as MenuCollectionViewCell          var row  indexPath.row         var image UIImage  UIImagecontentsOfFile menuImagesArray[row]          This is where the exception is being thrown         menuCell.imageView.image  image          return menuCell        codepre  pEDIT I thought it might be relevant to add that the main view controller is simply a UIViewController with an image view and the collection view over top of the image view. As for the cell in the collection view, what I am determining is that the code is not connected to the image view at all. The image is loaded into memory but I seem to have a disconnect between the image view in the cell and the code. Any help as to where this disconnect is would be very helpfulp  pEDIT 2Solvedp  pI asked the question differently with a bit different info and figured out the solution myself.

Negative 5584 pAfter a button click, an image is started being loaded. What I want when the image is fully loaded, a function is being called.p  pI know this question has been asked before, but every answer suggests to use the codeonloadcode event, which isnt entirely correct. According to the W3C spec, codeonloadcode is not a valid event for IMG elements. It wouldnt bother me very much if not for the fact that in some cases the event isnt fired.p  pEverything works fine except if the image weights much and the loading process takes some time for example 20s. I guess the codeonloadcode event may have some maximum waiting time set.

Negative 5584 pI have an AsyncTask that loads a ton of polygons on map.  The action to load the polygons on the map is triggered by a UI button click.p  pOn initial load of my map the user has a standard map with no polygons, when they click the button to load polygons it runs in the async task, and takes about 3  5 seconds for the process to complete.  Not great but its a lot of data.p  pOnce the user has clicked that button that state is saved and the polygons will automatically be loaded on the map the next time they enter the app.p  pThis is where I start to run into problems.  If I shutdown my app and reload the map comes up and automatically loads the polygons.  Yet this load takes 2030 seconds.p  pIt seems if my map is up and I let the user decide to load even if they click the button pretty fast, the polygons load fairly quickly.p  pYet If I auto load the polygons it takes orders of magnitude longer.  So much so that in this case I get skipped frames messages from the UI thread.p  pDoes an activity or maybe a google map view take a few seconds to settle  I know there is an event that gets fired when all map tiles are loaded, but I cannot wait for that cause it is not guaranteed to be called ie not all tiles may load if disconnected.p

I am not able to change any register settings, so I want to deal with it. According to the document there is an API to get the notifications from the file system. I assumed that the WatchService is the Java implementation of this API. Am I correctp  pI started with the WatchDir example from the jdk samples and stripped it a bit. I only need to know when a file is created and delete I dont care about file modifications. For testing I have added new File.exists when a new event has been triggered.

When the extra thread is started it is not accurate any more. I need a more accurate file.exists check in the whole application and all running threads. p  pFor testing I have used 2 Windows 7 pcs running java 7 with smb2 enabled which is default.

Negative 5584 pI was wondering how to create multiple instances of the same object in C. I have an example. Lets say I am creating a simple action game and I have an object called Bullet. If I hit f.e. a CTRL key it causes a gunfire. So I create an instance of Bullet. The instance dies when the bullet hits something or get out of the window. But what if I have f.e. something like machine gun. It can fire many bullets in a row. So I have to create many instances of Bullet, but how can I do that Should I at the beginning make a pointer like thisp  precodeBullet pointer codepre  pThen when I want to create an instance of the bullet I allocate a space in memory for one bullet. And when I want to create next bullet I allocate more space and so on. But when a bullet dies I got a dead space in memory...p  pSo I do not know how to handle this situation. I am new to OOP. I have programmed in C and now I want to learn C through the game programming it is quite fun . Thanks for the answersp

Negative 5584 pSo, this project is supposed to be a sort of dungeontraversing simulator. It is made from randomly generated 5x5 arrays of 1s and 0s. Initially, I fill each 5x5 array with 1s and 0s randomly, with 1s being spaces you can move to and from, and 0s being walls. p  pThe problem is, with the arrays 1s and 0s being put in random spots, there is currently no way to guarantee that the player can move updownleftright. There is no diagonal movement, and Im trying to find a way to ensure that the player can always move from one corner to another corner. There could be only one way to move in a direction, and no way to get to another corner. Corners are always 1, so the player can exist there. Either one or both indexes immediately beside each corner are also moveable to. So if youre in the top left corner, you can always move down andor right. You cant be stuck on that spot. p  pExamplep  p1   1   0   0   1p  p0   1   0   1   1p  p0   0   0   1   0p  p1   0   1   0   1p  p1   0   0   1   1p  pIf the player is at the top left corner, they can move right, then down, but then they are stuck. Im trying to find a way to ensure that all arrays are able to move from corner to corner. So the problem isnt simply making sure every 1 has a neighboring 1, but also that those 1s eventually move towards a corner. p  pThanksp

Negative 5584 pWell, I dont have reputation to post a photo, so this will be extremely difficult to explain, but I have a grouped dataframe which has 9 unique facilities and 7 years 20082014 for each facility.  For each grouped facilityyear, I have three column values 359.89 Etiologic, 359.89 Comorbid, Neither Etiologic Nor Comorbid which sum to one for each facilityyear combination as they represent the percent of total 359.89 Etiologic, 359.89 Comorbid, and Neither Etiologic Nor Comorbid totals, respectively.p  pAnd I got to that data through the followingp  precodedf3 df.groupby[NCIFacilityName, NCIComplianceYear,UDS35989FLAG][PatCode].count   df3  df3.unstack.applylambda x xx.sum,axis1.fillna0 codepre  pMy goal is to plot the year x against the 359.89 Etiologic column values y for each facility.  I am having trouble because any plot that I attempt plots all three columns against an x value for every facilityyear combination.  Id prefer to have 7 years on the xaxis 20082014 and 0 through 1 on the yaxis and want to plot the year against only the 359.89 Etiologic values.p
Negative 5584 pI need to sort data blocks which are stored in an array of structures. Structures have no pointers. Each block has its counter number and coordinates of the place in an array where the data block equal to the structure block is. For example if we have a data array which we can divide in 4 blocks of NxN, we have 4 structure blocks in index array of structure blocks and each of them has its own number and position in data array with the help of which we can compute the pointer of the block in data array using index block. Sorting should be done with the comparer that compares two blocks in such way that the least of two blocks shold have least ith number of data. For example comparerp  precodefor i  0 i lt N  N i       if a[i] lt b[i]  return 1     if a[i] gt b[i]  return 1  codepre  pwhere codeacode and codebcode are pointers to the blocks of data array which we can get due to index array and pointer of the start of data array. Sorting shouldnt sort data array but index array. So the question is what parallel algorithm can I use except frameworks, libraries, I need exactly algorithms or standard language kits, like pthread or qt libs, or cc standard libs to avoid synchronization errors The code or pseudocode would be helpful too.p
Negative 5584 pI have chat app In custom array adapter. I set random colors to usernames for each message with this codep  precodeString[] array  context.getResources.getStringArrayR.array.usernamecolors randomColor  array[new Random.nextIntarray.length] nameTextView.setTextColorColor.parseColorrandomColor codepre  pWhen new message arrive I add it to listview, and call adapter.notifyDataSetChanged This causes recoloring existing usernames in messages each time. How can I prevent recoloring existing items in listview when calling adapter.notifyDataSetChangedp  pstrongEdit 1strongp  precodeOverride     public View getViewint position, View convertView,

Just the logic alone, mocking the connection so no database. This is awesome because I can run a test of exclusively business logic without any other developers having to install or configure a database dependency.p  h3DBUnit Testing Resulth3  pHowever, a separate configuration can be run on demand to test the SQL queries themselves which is another type of test altogether. While also consolidating SQL tests to run separately from unit tests.p  pThe test would be exactly the same as above except the codePDOcode connection would not be mocked out and be a real database connection.p  h3Cause For Concernh3  pIm torn because although it is testing for different things, its essentially duplicate code.p  pIf I get rid of the unit test, I introduce a required database dependency at all times.

Negative 5584 pstrongScenariostrong Im having user object details saved in database which contains information related to user. These information can be Personal details Name, Email, Authentication details Dob, Employee Id, Additional information Address, Gender, Cellphone and Authorization details what access permissions that user have.p  pstrongRequirementstrong  1 I want to expose restful endpoint using MVC4 Web Api which will update these information. User can even clear off the existing details also. 2 I want the consumer of that endpoint to pass only changedupdated values. For ex if user wants to update Cell Phone, then no need to pass other detailsp  pstrongIssuesstrong 1 MVC4 framwork automatically desrializes Json into Api parameter class object. So,  the fields which are not passed in Json will have null value after deserialization. I need to differentiate between the fields which were not passed by consumer AND the fields which were passed by user and those value needs to be clear off. 2 Is it good to expose different endpoints to update different sections like personal information or Additional information or expose only one endpoint If I expose different endpoints, then consumer will have headache of firing more than one endpoint to update the information for same user.p  pstrongPossible approaches to handle Issue 1strong  1 User will pass only those fields which needs to be updated. So, expose single endpoint say Edit. Define a parameter class having all user details field type to be string. So, if user wants to remove any field data, then it has to pass as  empty string. In that way, I will be able to differentiate between fields not passed and fields to be remove.p  precode UserController.cs public HttpResponseMessage EditUserDetails incomingParameters       This is just pseudo code.       Get existing user details.      UserObject existingUserDetails  GetExistingUserObjectstring username       Now, convert put the nonnull fields in incomingParameters into       existingUserDetails. No need to put null values in incomingParameters       as those were not passed by consumer. I can implement extension       method here.      existingUserDetails  incomingParameters.ToUserObject      After that, my object to update is ready. Pass this         existingUserDetails to ORM and it will update into database.

Negative 5584 pHere is my situation I have written a number of Chrome userscripts for my personal use.

Negative 5584 pIm trying to find a crossplatform indoor wifi positioning solution.  We have investigated Apples CoreLocation.  Apple has surveyed our site and we have a working prototype that works fairly well.  However, Apples solution is Apple only and not cross platform.  Since roughly 50 of our users use Android phones, we need a solution that is cross platform.p  pUsing Apples indoor CoreLocation for Apple devices and Googles Geolocation for Android devices is not really feasible since we have over 2000 sites.  p  pa hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.commapsdocumentationgeolocation relnofollowhttpsdevelopers.google.commapsdocumentationgeolocationap  pGoogles Geolocation service WOULD be crossplatform if we had a way on iOS to get the access point MAC Address and signal strength.  Unfortunately I see no AppStore approved method of doing this.  Have I missed something in the Apple Apis  p  pIm also open to alternative solutions.  iBeacons would be cost prohibitive  at least for version 1.  Location sensing LED lights are out too.p

Negative 5584 pI have very huge query which takes data from many tables and group them by all noncalculated columns. And I need to reuse this query many times but with other grouping and filtering. In MSSQL I use CTE or temporary tables for such purpose but MySQL doesnt support CTE and I cant refer temporary table more than one time in the same query this is sad and illogical limitation of MySQL. p  precodeSELECT      t1.VideoId,      t1.RegionId,      t1.CountryId,      t1.PerCountryCount,     t2.PerRegionCount FROM      SELECT          VideoId,          RegionId,          CountryId,          SUMPlayCount PerCountryCount     FROM TrackedData     GROUP BY VideoId, RegionId, CountryId  t1 INNER JOIN      SELECT          VideoId,          RegionId,          SUMPlayCount PerRegionCount     FROM TrackedData     GROUP BY VideoId, RegionId  t2 codepre  pThis example is simplified but shows the problem. The t1 query has more detailed data and I want to reuse it in t2 query since in real project it is too hard to take data in t1 query million rows, many filters and groupings, etc.. the second reason why I want to reuse this query is query length. I dont want repeat just a bit changed query which has around 60 rows of code.p

Negative 5584 pI have three scala projects, A B and C, each built with SBT and two of which A and B are already published to our local jfrog artifactory server.

Ive read a bunch of other threads on this, but am still confused.p  pWhat I would like is, if the user does NOT check the Remember Me box persist cookie should be false, then when they close the browser or go for like 30 minutes without activity, they should have to log back in again. If they DO check it, then they shouldnt have to log in again for the time period specified in the web config. Will I have to add code myself to do this where I am setting the auth cookiep

Consider the code belowp  precodeclass A  public     A     ...     member functions     ...  protected     int commondata1     stdstring commondata2     ...   class B public A  public     B     member functions     ...  protected     stdstring classBspecificdata     ...   class C public A  public     C     member functions     ...  protected     stdstring classCspecificdata     ...  codepre  pThese classes are instantiated as the appropriate base class via conditional statements and stored in an stdlist by the base class pointer simultaneously in the same block of code like sop  precodestdlistltAgt ptrList  conditional statements either create a B or C object and then that object is appended to the list  if blahblah  true     A entry  new B else     A entry  new C  ptrList.appendentry codepre  pI need to perform an insertion sort on this container of base class pointers based on an integer value that both derived classes inherit however, in my previous attempts and upon inspection with a debugger tool, I find that my insertion sort algorithm properly makes the correct comparisons when accessing the integer that the comparison is based on, but I am bunable to swap the position of the base class pointersb in the stdlist. I want to sort this container of pointers so that I can easily print the data in the proper order with a simple for loop.p  pThis is clearly the result of a misunderstanding of pointer semantics, but to much avail I have been unable to find any reference or example that elucidates or solves the issue I am experiencing. p  pAny result that I have found either on this site or elsewhere solves this problem by using a container of the actual objects instead of a container of pointers to the objects. But, in my case, I cant do this because my code relies on the polymorphic behavior of the base class in order to have one big list of derived objects, instead of multiple lists for each derived object. Obviously, this makes calling member functions of the correct derived class extremely easy, and I would rather not redesign the entire structure of my data if I can avoid it.p  pIf requested, I can post snippets of my code andor the attempts that I have made to properly swap these pointer positions inside the container however, I am unsure if this would even be helpful, since I am clearly using the wrong syntax to handle the pointers.p  pI appreciate any feedback this problem has been plaguing me for the past few weeks and it is definitely time for me to step back and ask for assistance. I have a feeling that I am overanalyzing this issue, and that is most likely what is preventing me from solving the problem.p

Negative 5584 pI have a subscribe  publish WCF service, the service is hosted in a Windows Service. The data the Windows Service processes is being sent to subscribed clients. For some methods I need to use callbacks to Client Request from Service. However I also need to publish the data the Service is continuously generating through its tasks once per second sending updates to the clients. Using the Callback method to do this you guessed it when more than one method is sending lots of data I get a crash of the communicationobject. I read this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions18966590wcfcallbackblocksothercallbacksWCF CallBack Blocks other Callbacksa , which for him worked  in my scenario I have multiple methods pushing data about 30 rows x 12C every 1 second. Since my Client hangs and the CommunicationObject goes bust I can not send.  I would like to know if I can just have a DuplexChannel for the subscribing and general functions and then when I need to publish just add a separate Channel maybe create it on the fly in the service and send the data  If there is anyone with any experience or samples of this I would appreciate it.p  pOr maybe you can tell me I am all wrong in this and WCF will send callbacks at this rate to multiple methods with no problems and here is a sample how to do that.

Negative 5584 phave seen the similar question here, but the solution tehre does not work for me. I use embedded jetty 9, atmosphereruntime 234. I start my AtmosphereServlet in the embedded Jetty and want to start my ManagedService in the package where I have also got my atmosphereruntime library. But on the start of the Servlet I get a warning that no annotation processor is specialized and no annotations can be found. If I initiate my client now, my servlet gets the message but says that no AtmosphereHandler is defined. I can not simply switch to AtmosphereHandler, becuase with it WebSockets did not work posted in Google group, that is basically why I wanted to try ManagedService out. All my pathes are correct, but somehow the ManagedService annotation seems to be ignored. Could it be that it is because ByteAnnotationProcessor is being used as default How can I change it I have tried to allow scan of all classes, but this also does not help. If I map the AtmosphereHandler in configuration to my ManagedService I get conversion errors.

Negative 5584 pWe have a scenario where we want a node.js app to consume messages from a backend system that currently puts messages to an Websphere MQ queue through SAP PI.p  pIn MQ 8.0.0.3, there is a beta of AMQP support. a hrefhttpswww.ibm.comdeveloperworkscommunityblogsmessagingentrymqsupportformqlightbetanowavailablelangen relnofollowhttpswww.ibm.comdeveloperworkscommunityblogsmessagingentrymqsupportformqlightbetanowavailablelangenap  pHowever, I cant find a conclusive answer to how I get assured delivery. The perfect solution would be for the node.js app to register its subscription as durable, but how do I do that Well change the queue that SAP PI uses to an alias queue pointing to a topic. Using the mqlight client in node.js, version 1.0p
Negative 5584 pIs it possible to schedule a given task to run exactly codencode machine instructions before control is returned to the userp  pThe motivation for this question is the debugging of multithreaded programs, where this could be helpful to reliably reproduce certain bugs or undefined behaviour.p  pIm particularly interested in the case of codex8664linuxcode running on an Intel CPU, but solutions for other architectures or operating systems would also be interesting.p  pThe documentation for the kernel codeperfcode suite saysp  blockquote   pPerformance counters are special hardware registers available on most modern   CPUs. These registers count the number of certain types of hw events such   as instructions executed, cachemisses suffered, or branches mispredicted    without slowing down the kernel or applications. These registers can also   trigger interrupts when a threshold number of events have passed.p blockquote  pso it seems like the hardware could support this in principle, but Im not sure if this is exposed in any way to the user. p  pOf course its possible to just use codeptracecode to singlestep the program codencode times, but that would make all but the most simple programs impossibly slow.p

Negative 5584 pI have a display problem with my gxt grids GXT 2.3.1, codecom.extjs.gxt.ui.client.widget.gridcode. It is only visible if horizontal and vertical scrollbars are present As you can see on the screenshot, the header is missing a space on the right side above the scrollbar. This causes that header to be unaligned with the columns. The issue isnt easy to reproduce and occurs quite randomly, sometime after the grid has been resized.p  pSome additional information I just discovered The problem is the codeGridView.calculateVBarcode method It looks like the grid content could fit into the scroller if there was no horizontal scroll bar. So gxt thinks that the header needs no vertical scroll bar and no spacer on the right side. But as there are scroll bars ... bangp  pThis is also reproducible with GXT3 a hrefhttpswww.sencha.comexamplesExamplePlaceremotefiltergrid relnofollowhttpswww.sencha.comexamplesExamplePlaceremotefiltergrida you have to change the grid and column size to reproducep  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comGbY3V.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comGbY3V.png altenter image description hereap
