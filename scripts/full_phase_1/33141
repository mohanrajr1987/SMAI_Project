Positive 33141 pSo this is killing me.p  pI have looked at lots of forums but I cant seem to get any solutions to work.p  pBasically I have a grid of floated elements, each with a thumbnail image that on hover, has an overlay and text description of what that gallery contains its a typical looking folio site.p  pUsually I just have a fixed layout with an overlay box the same size as each image and a text container the same width which turns on and off on hover and thats fine. BUT  this is my first responsive version of the site and I have no idea how to make the size of the overlay and text match the dimensions of their parent.p  pI tried wrapping them all in a div but the child elements seem to ignore the parents dimensions anyway  presumably because they are floated. p  pI am using a fancybox gallery, the thumbnail image in question is marked with a comment but otherwise that works perfectly.p  pIs there a way to tell one div to match the width of another responsive img  Any help would be much appreciated.p  pHere is my htmlp  precodeltdiv classflexonegt     ltdiv classblackboxgtltblack low opacity box  appears on hovergtltdivgt     ltdiv classtextcontainergtlth2gtARTlth2gtltdivgt      lta classfancyboxthumb relgallery2 hrefimage1.jpggtltgallery image 1gt     ltimg classiconimage srcthumb.jpg  altmain icon gtltThis is the thumbnail image on pagegt ltagt     lta classfancyboxthumb relgallery2 hrefimage2.jpggtltgallery image 2gt  ltagt codepre  p  p  pThis is my CSSp  precode.flexone      width28     heightauto         floatleft     backgroundcolor000     overflowhidden     marginleft4     margintop4     mozboxsizing borderbox     boxsizing borderbox           .iconimage          width100         heightauto           .blackbox          height         width         overflowauto         opacity0         backgroundcolor000         position absolute         pointereventsnone               .textcontainer          width         margintop0px         height 20px         backgroundcolorrgba0,0,0,0         pointereventsnone         positionabsolute         backgroundcolortransparent           .textcontainer h2         textdecoration none         fontsize 13px         fontfamily Raleway, sansserif texttransform uppercase         colorFFF         zindex80000         opacity0         transformscale0       .flexonehover gt .textcontainer h2      transformscale1     opacity1   .flexonehover gt .blackbox      opacity.7  codepre

Positive 33141 pI understand that if I float an element, following elements will eventually disappear behind that element if they do not have a float set themselves or at least clear the float.

I initially had the div narrower in width but even as I extend it out it still stays on the bottom.p  pI know a way to work around it is to use CSS to add a position attribute to force it to where I want it to be, but from my experience with positioning things like that it may look right in one browser but may be 400px away in a different browser.

Positive 33141 pI was searching for a solution on how to include floating elements in their container by default, they fall out of it if its too short. I found the answer on Stackoverflow to set codeoverflowcode to codehiddencode for the container and indeed it worked. But my question is why Spec for codeoverflow hiddencode on w3cschools statesp  blockquote   pThis value indicates that the content is clipped and that no scrolling user interface should be provided to view the content outside the clipping region.p blockquote  pSo Id rather expect the part of the float to be clipped than the container to be extended to include the float.

Negative 33141 pI am faced with the choice where to store some reference data essentially drop down values for my application.

I could have a list of these records for each category, and then iterate over each record in the category to see if the filter criteria is met.

Negative 33141 pI have a parent report that has a list. The details group of this list contains one subreport. So basically if the list has 10 records rows the subreport is executed 10 times.p  pThe problem seems to be with interactive sorting in the SubReport. It has 4 columns with interactive sorting enabled. When I run the parent report and try to sort columns SSRS remembers the previous sort column and sorts by multiple columns at the same time. For example if I sort by Col A then click to sort by Col B, SSRS will preserve the sorting of Col A and the direction and then apply the sorting to Col B. However I simply want to sort by Col B and do not want to Col A to be part of the sort.p  pWhen I try this directly with the subreport everything works as expected. p  pAny ideas why this is happeningp

Negative 33141 pI am porting an ASP.NET application from 3.5SP1 to 4.0. The application works perfectly in 3.5SP1. In 4.0, I am seeing a difference in UpdatePanel behavior.p  pWe have a simple user control with a testbox, a button, and some text. The user control lives inside an UpdatePanel with UpdateModeConditional and ChildAsTriggerstrue.p  pUsers type into the textbox and click the button. We do a search.

But even though the button is raising an event back to the server, the update panel content is not updating.p  pHas anyone seen thisp

Negative 33141 pUsing ASP.NET, Im building an admin tool that requires a function to import a list of email addresses. Upon uploading the file, I want to check for existing records for any of the email addresses supplied. For nonexisting email addresses, I would create them using my DAO. p  pBasically I want top  ol liReceive list of emailsli liRetrieve data for existing emailsli liCreate data for new emails in dbli liReturn full data for all emails in list.li ol  pSince I want to know which of the emails exist up front, my first thought was to query the table for all records codeWHERE Email IN Email001FromFile, Email002FromFile, etc...code but the list could potentially contain thousands of email addresses, and Im not certain supplying that many email addresses to the IN operator would be a good idea.p  pI also thought about looping through the list and checking for a record for each email, but that would potentially generate far too many queries.p  pMy next thought was to generate a temp table to hold the list and modify the IN clause to use the temp table, rather than an explicit list of items, but that would require I execute SQL or a stored procedure directly, which Im not inclined to do since Im using NHibernate to access my DB.p  pThough I am using ASP.NET C and NHibernate, and any answers specific to that would be helpful, Im really just looking for general ideas on how to handle this scenario.p

Negative 33141 pThe preface to this question is that, I realize c macros are a touchy subject.  Many time they can be accomplished by a nonmacro solution that is more secure and not subject to classic problems like incremented arguments.  so with that out of the way.  I have a hash table implementation in c with linked nodes for collision.  Im sure most have seen this a million times but it goes a bit like this.p  precodetypedef struct tnodet      char key void value struct tnodet next  tnodet  typedef struct tablet      tnodet nodes     unsigned long nodecount     unsigned long iterator  see macro below         ...  codepre  pI would like to provide an abstracted way of iterating through the nodes.  I considered using a function which takes a function pointer and applies the function to each node but I often find this kind of solution very limiting so I came up with this macrop  precodedefine tbleachtable, node      fornodetablegtnodes[tablegtiterator0]         tablegtiteratorlttablegtnodecount         nodenodenodegtnexttablegtnodes[tablegtiterator]             if node codepre  pWhich can be used likep  precodetnodet n tbleachmytable, n      dostufftongtkey, ngtvalue  codepre  pThe only downside I can see is that the iterator index is a part of the table so obviously you could not have two loops going on at the same time in the same table. I am not sure how to resolve this but I dont see it as a deal breaker considering how useful this little macro would be.  So my question.p  p emupdatedem p  pI incorporated Zack and Jenss suggestion, removing the problem with else and declaring the iterator inside the for statement.  Everything appears to work but visual studio complains that type name is not allowed where the macro is used.  I am wondering what exactly happens here because it compiles and runs but I am not sure where the iterator is scoped.p  precodedefine tbleachtable, node      fornodetablegtnodes[0], unsigned long i0         ilttablegtnodecount         nodenodenodegtnexttablegtnodes[i]         if node  else codepre  pstrongIs this approach bad form and if not is there any way to improve itstrongp

I am using an NSTimers to schedule startUpdatingLocation followed by calling stopUpdatingLocation shortly afterwards to save as much battery as possible. p  pI want the user to be able to start the application and lock the phone thereby putting the application in an inactive state. My question is when this happens my application when running via Xcode seems to continue as normal, but I am curious if there are any differences in the way the application runs in this state as apposed to when the application is running as activep  pFrom the docs it only mentions applicationWillResignActive with regards to the application passing through that state on its way to the background. I am more interested in how an application behaves when a used locks the UI and puts the phone away, I just want to make sure its going to keep doing what it should be doing or do I need to take extra measuresp

Strangely, on Windows systems running this function on strips the EOL character for the first string in the map and the rest of them are still one character too long.p  pThis leads me to thinking that maybe I cant just replace the r and n characters, but everything I read suggests that its the combination of the two that Windows uses to represent EOL characters.p  pTo make it more explicit, heres a stepbystep layout of what Im attempting to do.

Negative 33141 pThis is more of a theoretical question. For my project I have one object with, lets say 1 object inside this object. The outer object is semitransparant so the inner object is visible as well. p  pThe outer object is rendered using raytracing implemented as a GLSL fragment shader. The inner object can be rendered in the same way I have the complete model containing both objects and their separate models containing empty space except where the object is. All is fine up till here.p  pLets say I want to render a silhouette on the inner object as well. I could do this in objectspace with some 3D Sobel filter to find my outer edge voxels of the object and take a dot product of its normal N with my view direction V. This way, voxels constructing the front of the object in 2D are not classified as silhouette pixels. If I would not take a dot product I would get a black object rendered in 2d since all outer voxels are classified as edge voxels and therefor made black and fully opaque. When rendered it produces a black 2d object. Sop  precoderun 3D sobel filter    if classified as boundary voxel       check if dotV,N lt 0           this is and edge voxel on the edge of my view codepre  pBut since I work with raytracing, which is a direct volume rendering techique, I do not have my normals handed to me. My estimated normals are not good enough to succesfully run the above technique. Furthermore, other techniques I want to apply require way more code in objectspace than when implemented as imagespace algorithms.p  pstrongThe real problemstrongp  pWhat I want to do is run imagebased glsl shaders on certain parts of the total object only on the inner object for example and combine this with other results from objectbased approaches. For instance, I want to run a 2d edge detection algorithm imagespace on my inner object, and combine this with the result of the objectspace rendered outer object which was semitransparant. p  pThere are two problemsp  ol liI cannot simply run the imagebased shader on the result of the objectspace stage. That way my edge detection algorithm would also classify edges found in the object emoccludingem my inner object. So only applying my edge recognion to certain areas of the resulting image of the objectspace stage is not possible. li liWhen I run my imagespace algorithms on the separate objects I get the correct edge pixels and correct rendered single object the technique is applied too. However, in this case al depth information is gone and when combining there will occur ordering problems. Objects will appear to be in front while they are not.li ol  pMy first idea was to have a look at deferred shading and see if it can help me in any way. I have been reading some basic information but do not yet foresee to find the solution in here. Therefor, I will ask SO users to share their ideas .p  pThanks in advance.

Negative 33141 pIm currently developing an iPad application that integrates MapKit. But I have a small issue. I display lines between two points on my map but when these points are one at the very west of the map and an other one at the very east of it, for instance, I would like to draw the shortest line between then. In other words, I would like to center my map between these two points but not in the usual way because If I do so I have to draw a line from the left one that goes left to the left border of the map, then continues from the right border to the right marker... so on the opposite point of the map and then draw the shortest route that is know in the middle of my view.  Ive thought of two ideas that could help me...     Change the map background and have a map centered on a different place of the planet,    Instead of a map as background, have 2 maps side to side and switch to the right one according to what I need to display,p  pBut I couldnt find anything about it... Do you know if these solutions would be possible and how  If not, would you have an other idea about how to do what Im trying to do p  pThanks in advance p

If I stop the app and restart it, the objects appear in the tableview, leading me to believe that they are being inserted to the core data store successfully but are not being merged into the managedObjectContext being used on the main thread.p  pI have included a sample of my operations init, main and notification methods.

However, since I am new to JavascriptDojo, I wasnt able to fully understand it, and neither was the answerer of the question. p  pMy question is How does the following code workp  precodedndController functionarg, params     return new dijit.tree.dndSource         arg,   dont mess up with the first parameter         dojo.mixin, params, copyOnlytrue            create a copy of the params object, but set copyOnly to true  codepre  pSo the part bugging me the most is the args and params parameters. I dont understand where they come from and what they mean or represent. If there needs to be more context to the code, I can edit the question later, so just post it in the comments. Also, why couldnt I just use the codenew dijit.tree.dndSourcecode directly and why did I need to use the function to return it p  pThanksp
Negative 33141 pOk, so Ive pretty much tried everything. I bet its something really simple but I cant seem to get a hold of it. p  pThe server sends me the time, which is epoch. However when I put this into a date object it seems to automatically pick up the time zone and it adds 3 to the server time. So if the gmt time is 00.00, it says its 03.00. p  pI also need to add a timezone of my own. Lets say the epoch time is 00.00 again, it should read 10.00 after I add the timezone. p  pany help would be much appreciated. Thank youp

Negative 33141 pI have a mashup, I am building Restful services that are called from a thin client. I have worked in plethora of environments, ranging from Java EE EJB to Spring oriented environment in conjunction with technologies like JSP,JS frameworks like JQuery,ExtJS etc.  br While building my restful architecture and developing services, I cannot convince myself to use MVC implemented maybe by Spring or use JSF or any other framework For the moment i am using just the followingp  ul liUI layer  XHTML, JQueryli liJAXRS Jersey Implementation Since I rely on JAXRS I am guessing I can swap implementations easilyli liHadoopli liApache Luceneli liCassandrali liMemcached for now, I am evaluating infinispanli litomcat 7li liBuild System Mavenli liHudson CIli ul  pbr Leaving technologies aside, My restful services also employ event driven paradigm to do stuff that I cannot discuss here These event listeners are RestFul Service Listeners same as other services but just using Event Listener Paradigm. br Now the question What questions should I be asking myself I know how to architect and build a restful SOA, any suggestions would be good and use JQuery to call these services. I want to know is the system I have scalable for a webscale say a billion hit OK I am exaggerating but still system. br Is traditional model of Either Spring MVC with Spring DI and other springified features and JSP technologies OR Java EE EJBs, applicable here I wanna be a minimalist, Since we are a startup, I want my application to scale well and be architecturally consistent and extensible, I am making sure of that by building a very clean i think so atleast Restful WS API platform, please help in clarifying my conundrum, Hope my question makes sense...br br emEDIT FOR MORE CLARIFICATIONembr The thing is I have 3 clusters right now, one for Services, running Restful services, One for Apache Cassandra, One for memcached. As I said, I am a startup, I want to minimize my costs of hardware and other setup, So when I add an MVC framework, I would probably have to keep it deployed separately reason I am building a platform and app, they should not be coupled together...brp

The .ogg returns a 404.0 error in fiddler, it has a ContentType of texthtml charsetutf8.p  pAnother suggestion was to register a Start task in the ServiceDefinition.cdef which would run a cmd file which would call appcmd.exe to set the mimeType e.g. codewindirsystem32inetsrvappcmd.exe set config sectionstaticContent [fileExtensionogg,mimeTypeaudioogg]code.  Again, this did not work.p  pIt seems that others have been having success with these methods when trying to serve other static content types.

I know you use the FileBuffer and I know how to write to text files, Im just not sure the best approach to format them and how to read them in.p  pI was thinking of formatting the table something like thisp  precode              id  0,         Title  Sample Achievement,         Desc  Sample description,         Points  5,         CurVal  3,         MaxVal  10,         Img  pathtoimg.jpg,                     id  1         ... codepre  pThat would give me access to each achievement as its own subtable, or something like that and I can build an Achievement object around the values I get back for later use.p

Negative 33141 pThis is a general architecture question.  I read in many places that in an MVC framework, 1 models ought to be fat, and controllers ought to be skinny.  But I also read that 2 the details depend on the framework youre developing in.  So, what if youre developing in djangop  pMy experience with django is that a lot of the logic ends up getting put into views and forms.  Not the business logic, but the details of handling requests, sessions, etc.  In terms of lines of code, these details often outweigh the business logic of manipulating model objects.  Am I doing something wrong, or is this how django worksp
Negative 33141 pIm building a query that needs data from 5 tables. Ive been told by a DBA in the past that specifying a list of columns vs getting all columns  is preferred from some performancememory aspect. Ive also been told that the database performs a JOIN operation behind the scenes when theres a list of tables in the FROM clause, to create one table or view.p  pThe existing database has very little data at the moment, as were at a very initial point. So not sure I can measure the performance hit in practice. I am not a database pro. I can get what data I need. The dillema is, at what price.p  pAdded At the moment Im working with MS SQL Server 2008 R2.p  pMy questions arep  ol lipIs there a performance difference and why, between the following a. SELECT ... FROM tbl1, tbl2, tbl3 etc for simplicity somehow I feel that this might be a performance hit b. SELECT ... FROM tbl1 inner join tbl2 on ... inner join tbl3 on ... etc would this be more explicit to the server and save on performancememory c. SELECT ... FROM select x,y,z from tbl1 as t1 inner join ... etc would this save anythig or is it just extra select statements that create more work for the server and for uspli lipIs there yet a better way to do thispli ol  pBelow are two queries that both get the slice of data that I need. One includes more nested select statements.p  pI apologize if they are not written in a standard form or helplessly overcomplicated  hopefully you can decipher.

Negative 33141 pConsider the following code sample that uses MEF to create an object of type codeImportercode that imports an object of type codeImporterExportercode which in turn imports an object of type codeExportercode, i.e. codeImporter gt ImporterExporter gt Exportercode. The catalog is managed by a codeCompositionUtilitycode obviously simplified for this example.p  pI know that MEF will resolve imports recursively on imported parts. However, because I want to have the option to instantiate each of these classes independetly, every class with imports also composes itself in its constructor to resolve those imports.p  precodeusing System using System.ComponentModel.Composition using System.ComponentModel.Composition.Hosting using System.Reflection  namespace MefRecursionSample      class Program              static void Mainstring[] args                       var importerExporter  new ImporterExporter  include this and composition will work             var importer  new Importer             Console.Writeimporter.ImporterExporter.Exporter.Value  should print 7             Console.ReadKey                    class CompositionUtility              static CompositionUtility                      var executingAssembly  Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly             var assemblyCatalog  new AssemblyCatalogexecutingAssembly             compositionContainer  new CompositionContainerassemblyCatalog                   private static CompositionContainer compositionContainer         private static bool isComposing          public static void Composeobject part                      compositionContainer.ComposePartspart                    class Importer              public Importer                      CompositionUtility.Composethis                   [Import]         public ImporterExporter ImporterExporter  get set            [Export]     class ImporterExporter              public ImporterExporter                      CompositionUtility.Composethis                   [Import]         public Exporter Exporter  get set            [Export]     class Exporter              public int Value  get  return 7          codepre  pRunning the code as is leads to a composition error The ComposablePart of type MefRecursionSample.Importer cannot be recomposed...., obviously because I am trying to explictly compose something that MEF also wants to compose.p  pWhat surprised me, was the fact that when I included the first line of the codeMaincode method, i.e. create an object of type codeImporterExportercode without MEF, this doublecomposition no longer caused an exception. Why is thatp  pAlso, how could I make it work such that I could instantiate each of these indepennetly, yet also make them compose themselves when chained as in the sample. I figured I would introduce a boolean flag codecompositionInProgresscode on the codeCompositionUtilitycode and immediately return from codeComposecode when the flag is set to avoid the recursive composition.

Adding a variable k makes the loop work for one run,       but eventually crashes on the second loop using numbers[i][j][k].       So I tried chartointnumbers[i][j].cstr, but the compiler       complains that const char  is incompatible with char. Adding a       pointer resolves the issue chartoint  numbers[i][j].cstr  ,       but the program still crashes on the second loop through.           for int i  0 i lt 100 i         for int j  0 j lt 50 j             for int k  0 k lt 1 k used when the variable k was being used                 addends[i][j]  chartoint numbers[i][j].cstr       return 0  codepre  pThe code isnt finished I decided against going on since I obviously need to fix this first.p

Negative 33141 pWhen I bind my context as codeInRequestScopecode, the context is disposed when the code in  DelegatingHandler is called instantiated in ApplicationStart and executed before controllers are initialized. If I use InTransientScope, then it works but I want 1 context for everything.

Negative 33141 pA bit of a complex problem to describe herep  pI would like to have a function AB, which maps one input to another, through an intermediate value.

However, I introduce a few variables globally, mainly dictB and dictA, and Im not sure if thats the best way to do it. I can separate getB into its own package, but I would still be left calling them somewhere in the global frame. Not sure what the approach to this should be, I want to call A and B, which calls a file in the same package as few times as possible but abstract the function AB.p

Negative 33141 pSo I have many Canvases with many UI Elements. About 72 canvases with 40000 ui objects across all of them. When switching between these canvases especially the ones with a lot of ui objects I get a lot of lag about 2 seconds. Basically all that is happening is Im setting the new canvases visibility to codeVisiblecode and the previous one to codeCollapsedcode. But if I go back to a canvas that has had its visibility set to codeVisiblecode before it does not lag. p  pIs there anyway to buffer the canvases into memory before the WPF application finishes loading I have a splash screen where the program is loaded up so when I click a canvas that hasnt been set to codeVisiblecode before it will load quickly.p

Negative 33141 pIn Delphi XE, I use the rename variable refactoring CtrlShiftE a lot of the time to make my code easier to understand by giving more meaningful variable names, for examplep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comvxo1u.png altenter image description herep  pThat is all good but I have one slight issue regarding workspace when I use this. I like to keep the code messages etc pinned to the bottom, they only appear when I hover my mouse over them  this is my preference to allow more space for the editor.p  pNow, when I use the rename variable refactoring, the dialog has the checkbox codeView references before refactoringcode as shown from the image above. I have this unchecked as I generally dont need to oversee what is been changed etc, if needs be I just undo it.p  pHere is my issue, with that unchecked I would of hoped for the refactoring to of performed silently, but no I still get the refactorings window showing up underneathp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comargxV.png altenter image description herep  pIt might not be considered a major issue but every time I have to manually close the refactorings window is just wasting time and is becoming a nuisance.p  pI noticed if you click on the refactorings tab in the editor there is an option to hide, but this is not permanent as it will come back the next time you refactor anyway.p  pIs there an option I may have missed somewhere to prevent the refactorings window from displaying in the code editorp

Negative 33141 pWe are departing from our typical native application development and are developing some new webbased application services.  We are using .Net and WCF and most likely hosting on IIS.p  pOur services will need to use a database to persist data.  In all cases we intend to make the database server a different box than our host.  Most of the resources we find seem to indicate storing the database connection string in the web.config or app.config file for selfhosting. Our concern is that since the service is webfacing the box it is running on is a more likely to be hackedcompromised.  If that happens, the attacker now had the DB connection string and will have full access to all of the data.p  pAn initial thought was to make the WCF service simply proxy to a server application that lives on another machine that holds the connection information and does all the processing logic. That way, if the the webhost is compromised they would have to figure out how to communicate with our server application, or compromise that machine as well, to gain database access.  Though we do have concerns of the performance costs of proxying and possibly having a bottleneck at the server application.p  pThe concern with that approach is that we are not finding much in the way of WCFIIS literature that recommending on such an approach, but we might just not know what it is called in order to find such information.  The question is proxying like that a good practice and whywhy not or where might I find more information on this topic, or is there a better practicep

Everything is coded to interfaces to help with mocks in unit testing.p  pI dont want the domain project taking on a dependence on an IoC container but I need some way of having all instances created in the domain project getting the right repositories injected. How can I do this I also want to be able to do injections from the harness and test project where necessary. The only way I can think of doing this is by having a static object in the Domain class which wraps the StandardKernel from NInject and call that to populate the dependencies. It would be nice also if i can have constructor injection working which I dont think it would using that method. The other alternative I can think of is have a factory which builds the domain objects with the correct dependencies, but Id rather be able to have IPerson person  new Person rather than have to call a factory each time.p  pThanks in advance.p

For updating the dependencies, compiling and running on the deviceemulator, I usep  precodeclean install androiddeploy androidrun codepre  pHowever, this also uninstalls the previous app.p  pFor debugging, sadly I do what is written a hrefhttpcode.google.compmavenandroidpluginwikiDebug relnofollowherea which doesnt allow debugging from the beginning, plus it has many more steps, or use a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidosDebug.htmlwaitForDebugger2829 relnofollowDebug.waitForDebuggera which requires me to change to code each time for toggling run and debug modes.p  pHow can I have the same functionality of running and debuggsing as the normal ADT plugin p  pEdit about the uninstallation issue, the answer would be to set undeployBeforeDeploy to false instead of true.p

Refactoring is not an option because of the size of the codebase currently. p  pThe biggest issue of course is the fact that Im trying to mimic an environment that was built out 11 months ago, and need the followingp  pnode v0.6.11 npm v1.1.1 brunch v0.8.1 coffeescript v1.2p  ppackage.json currently has    p  precode dependencies      coffeescript gt 1.1.1,     underscore    gt 1.1.7,     eco           gt 1.0.3,     nomnom        1.0.0,     stylus        gt 0.13.7,     async         gt 0.1.9,     yaml          gt 0.2.1,     file          gt 0.1.1,     stitch        gt 0.3.2,     uglifyjs     gt 1.0.6   ,   devDependencies      coffeescript gt 1.1.1,     express       gt 2.4.3,     nodeunit      gt 0.5.3,     zombie        gt 0.9.7    codepre  pThe issue of course is that the coffeescript that was originally installed was 1.4 and I need the be compiling with 1.2. Ive tried changing the package.json to be coffeescript 1.2 in the dependencies section and then ran cake setup. But that didnt change anything. Where am I going wrong here or am I approaching this all wrongp  pI have a local copy of the correct version of coffeescript 1.2 on the same system but I dont know how to point brunch to use that one instead of the one installed in its subdirectory. p  pAny help is appreciated.

Now how do I do this I tried a postorder traversal like thisp  precodelast  None def mypostorderroot     if root       mypostorderroot.left       mypostorderroot.right       if last         last.parent  root       last  root codepre  pBut obviously it is not working, and I know why, after updating the codeparentcode pointer of a leftchild, it sets it as codelastcode, so next time when it visits the rightchild its sibling, it sets its codeparentcode to the leftchild. How to tweak it to get the correct result Is it possible to do it iteratively as well, using a stack, may bep

Negative 33141 pI have developed 3 iPad single window applications and my apps were rejected in app store because they belong to an organization. I have been searching solutions for publishing these apps in app store without distributing them through adhoc distribution.

I tried to use a boolean, which would wait until the parser saw the first instance of beer, but I am getting an empty list, which is really frustrating me, as the almostidentical parser that makes an array of liquors is working magnificently. p  pIs there an easy way to skip the liquors in the file Am I on the right track with a boolean Should I throw the SAX parser out the window and use something else  Thank you. p

Negative 33141 pI have the weirdest thing happening, and Im not quite sure why its happening. Basically what I need to do is use fgetc to get the contents of a simple ASCII file byte by byte.

Literally all I did wasp  precodedo      temp  char checkedrealloc temp, n1     e  fgetcgetnextbyteargument     temp[n]  e     if e  EOF       n   while e  EOF codepre  pAnd then to check I just printed each character outp  precodetempsize  strlentemp1 fordebugk  0 debugk lt tempsize debugk   printfc, temp[debugk]  codepre  pAnd it outputs everything correctly except it added an extra newline that wasnt in the file. Before that, I hadp  precodetempsize  strlentemp codepre  pBut then it ended on some unknown byte that printed gibberish. I tried strlentemp2 just in case and it worked for that particular file, but then I added an extra a to the end and it broke again.p  pIm honestly stumped. I have no idea why its doing this.p  pEDIT checkedrealloc is just realloc but with a quick check to make sure Im not out of memory. I realize this is not the most efficient way to do this, but Im more worried about why I seem to be magically reading in extra bytes.p

Negative 33141 pI dont do a lot of Qt programming so this may sound like a silly question, but what happened to QListViewItem in qt4p  pI have this application I wrote some time ago in qt3. I changed that to qt4 using the aptly name qt3toqt4 program all this on a Fedora platform. p  pInternally it seems to change a lot of classes from QClass to Q3Class probably to provide some sort of backwards compatibility and then compile it with qt4. I had some problems with it today to do with reading stdout from a QProcess, but that aside and I decided to simply rewrite the application in qt4.p  pNow for the problem  I use a QListView and to this I add loads of QListViewItems in a tree like structure. Something like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comu1V14.png altenter image description herep  pBut that doesnt seem to be available anymore in qt4. And I cant find any examples that provide this behaviour either. Is there a way to do this in qt4 To maybe make it more complicated  I used my own QListViewItems derived from QListViewItem ...p
Negative 33141 pI have 47 mediaelementjs audio elements on one web page.  When I open the page they all try to preload and little blue progress bars fly everywhere.  Some of them make it but others never get started.  The src tag for each of these is pointing to an mp3 file on my dropbox account.  When I click play on ones that never get started they dont play.

Negative 33141 pIm working on a plugin system for my CMS, inside my CMS I use namespaces a lot. What I would like to have is that the developers of the plugins dont have to use namespaces inside their plugin, because they can be very complicated for developers who doesnt have used namespaces before. The main problem with the namespaces is the events which can be registered. Right now, plugin developers have to load an Event class using codeuse eventsEventcode, and if they just import the class they are still not able to use codenew Eventcode because it uses namespaces. What I would like to have is that they can just use codenew Eventcode The class itself would be autoloaded by the CMSs auto loader, so no include required.p  pSo basically, I would like to have namespaces disabled in certain classes or files. So codenew eventsEventcode will just look like codenew Eventcode without removing the codenamespace eventscode from the codeEventcode class.p  pI hope I explained it clear, Im not the best in explaining this kind of stuff.p

Negative 33141 pI have a list comprehension that looks like thisp  precodecart  [ p,pp,q,qq for p,pp,q,qq          in itertools.productC.items, repeat2          if p[1]  q[1] ] codepre  pcodeCcode is a dict with keys that are tuples of arbitrary integers . All the tuples have the same length. Worst case is that all the combinations should be included in the new list. This can happen quite frequently.p  pAs an example, I have a dictionary like thisp  precodeC   0,1b,       2,0c,       0,0d  codepre  pAnd I want the the result to be p  precodecart  [ 2, 0, c, 0, 1, b          2, 0, c, 0, 0, d          0, 0, d, 0, 1, b          0, 0, d, 0, 0, d ] codepre  pSo, by overlap I am referring to, for instance, that the tuples code1,2,3,4code and code2,3,4,5code have the overlapping section 2,3,4. The overlapping sections must be on the edges of the tuples. I only want overlaps that have length one shorter than the tuple length. Thus code1,2,3,4code does not overlap with code3,4,5,6code. Also note that when removing the first or last element of a tuple we might end up with nondistinct tuples, all of which must be compared to all the other elements. strongThis last point was not emphasized in my first example.strongp  pThe better part of my codes execution time is spent in this list comprehension. I always need all elements of codecartcode so there appears to be no speedup when using a generator instead.p  pMy question is Is there a faster way of doing this p  pA thought I had was that I could try to create two new dictionaries like thisp  precodeaa  defaultdictlist bb  defaultdictlist [aa[p[1]].appendp for p in C.keys] [bb[p[1]].appendp for p in C.keys] codepre  pAnd somehow merge all combinations of elements of the list in codeaa[i]code with the list in codebb[i]code for all codeicode, but I can not seem to wrap my head around this idea either.p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pBoth the solution added by tobiask and shx2 have better complexity than my original code as far as I can tell. My code is On2 whereas the two other solutions are On. For my problem size and composition however, all three solutions seem to run at more or less the same time. I suppose this has to do with a combination of overhead associated with function calls, as well as the nature of the data I am working with. In particular the number of different keys, as well as the actual composition of the keys, seem to have a large impact. The latter I know because the code runs much slower for completely random keys. I have accepted tobiasks answer because his code is the easiest to follow. However, i would still greatly welcome other suggestions on how to perform this task. p

Negative 33141 pIm trying to try rebuilding my personal portfolio site from scratch, mostly for jQuery practice, and Ive only just started but am having 2 problems.p  pFirst of all, heres a link to  a preview of what I have so far a hrefhttpwww.forrestmckinney.comportfoliopreview relnofollowhttpwww.forrestmckinney.comportfoliopreviewap  pBasically my thinking was to have big background images with divs that scroll into view on every other navigation click.  As the divs scroll, the background image changes.  However, I also want the divs to be sized dynamically via the breaksize function which is where Im having the issue.  The function works great for setting the size of each div, even on resize, but for some reason the spacing is off.  The first one shows up fine, then each one after that is too highp  precodefunction breaksize      var windowY  window.height        var breakHeight 94  windowY  100      var marginY  windowY  breakHeight2      .break.cssheight, breakHeight     .break.cssmargintop, marginY  windowY     .break.cssmarginbottom, marginY  codepre  pSo unless Im missing something, this code should set the height of each .break div to 94 of the window hight, set the marginY variable to the window height  break height2 one half for top, one half for bottom, and then set the bottom margin to marginY and top margin to to the marginY plus the height of the window effectively spacing out each div by one window height, allowing the full background image to show up in between divs.  p  pThe other issue I have is with the flicker in between images.  Ive added e.preventDefaults, but no luck.p  pAnyone know whats going on there Thanks in advancep

Negative 33141 pIve recently started reading up on NodeJS and JS and am a little confused about how call backs are working in NodeJs. Assume we do something like thisp  precodesetTimeoutfunction     console.logWorld ,1000 console.logHello codepre  pemoutput Hello Worldemp  pSo far on what Ive read strongJS is single threaded so the event loop is going though one big stack, and Ive also been told not to put big calls in the callback functions.strongp  p1p  pOk, so my first question is assuming its one stack does the callback function get run by the main event loop thread if so then if we have a site with that serves up content via callbacks fetches from db and pushes request, and we have 1000 concurrent, are those 1000 users basically being served synchronously, where the main thread goes in each callback function does the computation and then continues the main event loop If this is the case, how exactly is this concurrentp  p2 How are the callback functions added to the stack, so lets say my code was like the followingp  precodesetTimeoutfunction     console.logHello ,1000 setTimeoutfunction     console.logWorld ,2000 codepre  pthen does the callback function get added to the stack before the timeout even has occured if so is there a flag thats set that notifies the main thread the callback function is ready or is there another mechanism. If this is infact what is happening doesnt it just bloat the stack, especially for large web applications with callback functions, and the larger the stack the longer everything will take to run since the thread has to step through the entire thing.p

Negative 33141 pHello I am working in a project in wich you are supposed to open some  chatwindows, this windows use a plugin for a custom scroll bar. I am accessing  JSON to get the variables of the name of the person and his status then I generate a template with underscore and preppend it to the body of my HTML, when I do this the new window chat doesnt get the custom scroll plugin. I would like to ask if you guys know a way to achieve this because already what i got is something like this.p  precodedocument.onready, functions function functions           My jquery plugin      .messagescontainer.slimScroll     height 200,     size 10px,     position right,     color 535a61,     alwaysVisible false,     distance 0,     railVisible true,     railColor 222,     railOpacity 0.3,     wheelStep 10,     disableFadeOut false,     start bottom               online .username.onclick, checkUser   function checkUser     this is the function that acces the JSON then pass parameter to another function to open the chat window.I removed some code to go better straight to the point.     ifuser  jsonUserName     displayChatWindowjsonUserName, jsonUserStatus, jsonUserAvatar       function displayChatWindowuser, status, avatar     console.logavatar     var template  .templatewindowTemplate.html, userName user, userStatus status, userAvatar avatar     body.prependtemplate     .messagescontainer.slimScroll         height 200,         size 10px,         position right,         color 535a61,         alwaysVisible false,         distance 0,         railVisible true,         railColor 222,         railOpacity 0.3,         wheelStep 10,         disableFadeOut false,         start bottom               .friendwindow.draggablehandler .header     .chat input, .chat textarea.onfocus, cleanInputs     .chat input, .chat textarea.onblur, setInputs  codepre  pSo far what I do is append the template and recall all the functions.

Every component of the page like textBox or gridView belongs to a particular instance.br Please correct me if these are wrong.li ol  pProblembr As I am forced to use page methods to get some of the data from client side javascript I have no choice but to use static methods. What I want to achieve is to be able to store instance of the page, or at least some sort of reference, in a session variable so then I can later get back to it and get or set values for particular controls in the desired page instance. So what Ive done is I store current instance this in a session variable. This is only assigned once isPostback on PageLoad. Following the logic of reference type, every change in the instance of the page should be reflected in the session variable, but somehow it is not. If theres a change in some controls values, I can easily see that they are reflected in the instance of the page on postBack as they should, however the content of my session variable is not being changed. Its behaving as if it was a struct. The same happens when Im trying to store the instance in the static class variable although that would not be a solution even if it worked, as its a multiuser web app.p  pCould anyone explain to me what is going on, and correct my thinking if its wrong.p

Negative 33141 pIve been looking for the way to increase the speed of processing messages received from rabbitmq queue. The only way Ive found is make more than one threads doing the same  receiving and processing. And this gave me some profit. After I created 4 threads the speed quadrupled. As I have 8core processor Ive decided to increase the number of threads to 8. But this gives no performance increasing. YourKit shows that only 50 of CPU is used. Somebody can say that my app is lightweight and so it is so, but I can say that it cant do more work than it does regardless I produce much more what to do. Why this doesnt workp

Negative 33141 pI created an android application that takes some data using editText field such as Name, Contact, one radiogroup button, two buttons for save and view stored data and a spinner and stores these information in database when save button is pressed. Datas are displayed at the bottom of the screen when view button is pressed.Usually the spinner shows value 18 as by default.Everything is fine,when I open the application and press save button after entering the fields it saves and when once view button is pressed datas are displayed but I can not insert more data by opening the application once because the content of spinner is hidden now. To do that I need to close the application and then open it once again. How to overcome this problem.

Ive tried the followingp  blockquote   p[machinename][queuename] e.g. ServerBtestqueuep      pFormatNamedirect[machinename]private[queuename] e.g. FormatNamedirectServerBprivatetestqueuep      pDIRECT[machinename]PRIVATE[queuename] e.g. DIRECTServerBprivatetestqueuep      pFormatNamedirectos[machinename]PRIVATE[queuename] e.g. FormatNamedirectosServerBprivatetestqueuep blockquote  pemNote I have host file entries for both servers listing the workgroupnetbios names against the relevant fixed EC2 IP addressesemp  pUsing the two FormatName entries, I do not get any errors but the messages never arrive. Using the others give me an error regarding the format name. On the private queues I have given everyone full control.p  pCan anyone advise on how I can send a message from one EC2 windows server to a private queue not on a domain on anotherp  pThanksp

I only had placed the code on the first if to test that it works before I repeat it the other 5 times.p  pSecond Update Issue onClick of  button, the number to the left of the Button increments 1 and then adds it with the coloured number and setText to the left most zero. If I scroll down and then scroll back up the row resets the view. If I notifyDataSetChanged at the end of onClick, nothing happens instead. In either case, the database does not update.p  pNeither of these events are updating the table and I am not receiving any errors in the compiler or runtime.p  pAny help would greatly be appreciated

Negative 33141 pI was wondering if I could have parameter packs consisting of a single, explicitly specified, type. For example, something like thisp  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt  using namespace std  void show    templatelttypename First, typename... Restgt void showFirst f, Rest... rest      cout ltlt f ltlt endl     showrest...   void fooint f, int... args  error      showf, args...   int main      foo1, 2, 3  codepre  pThe problem Im having is with the definition of codefoocode. With OS X clang version 5 llvm 3.3svn I get the error codeerror type int of function parameter pack does not contain any unexpanded parameter packscode.p  pOf course, I can get it to compile by changing to codefoocode into a function templatep  precodetemplatelttypename... Argsgt void fooint f, Args... args      showf, args...  codepre  pHowever now codefoocode will accept codeintcode for the first parameter, and anything output streamable for the rest. For examplep  precodestruct x   ostreamamp operatorltltostreamamp o, x      o ltlt x     return o   int main      foo1, 2, x, 3  compiles   codepre  pNow, Ive seen a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma3703826the accepted solution herea which suggests using type traits and codestdenableifcode, but thats cumbersome. They also suggested using codestdarraycode but I think a simple codestdinitializerlistcode works just fine and looks cleaner, like sop  precodevoid fooimplinitializerlistltintgt ints      forint i ints         cout ltlt i ltlt endl   templatelttypename... Argsgt void fooint f, Args... args      fooimplf, args...   struct x   ostreamamp operatorltltostreamamp o, x      o ltlt x     return o   int main      foo1, 2, 3     foo1, 2, x, 3  no longer compiles                         we also get an error saying no known conversion from x to int   codepre  pSo thats neat. But the question remains, is this necessary Is there really not a way to define a nontemplate function which accepts a parameter pack of specific type Like thisp  precodevoid fooint... args   codepre

Negative 33141 pRecently I had to replace a single container with a collection of similar containers. As a result, I needed a combined iterator retaining the semantics of the original iterator. The problem that I ran into was the handling of the combined end position. Without the ability to compare unassigned iterators, I had to include all four iterators as members i.e. the two ranges, external and internal. This resulted in operator requiring three comparisons in the most common case. This, of course, is much worse than comparison in the ordinary nested loops which require single comparison in the most common case. Beside that I noticed that the four iterator code is prone to errors, because keeping the end iterators in the combined iterator may lead to skipping the exit condition of the for loop if container contents changes inside the loop. Here is a sketch of the code I usedp  precode   template ltclass Tgt    class MyContainer           typedef stdvectorltTgt Inner       typedef stdvectorltInnergt Outer       Outer v    public       class iterator                 friend class MyContainer          Outeriterator it1, it1end          Inneriterator it2, it2end          iteratorOuteriterator it1, Outeriterator it1end              it1it1, it1endit1end                       ifit1it1end                 it2  it1gtbegin                it2end  it1gtend                              public          bool operatoriterator it const              return it1it.it1 ampamp                it1it1end  it2it.it2                         iterator begin  return iteratorv.begin, v.end        iterator end  return iteratorv.end, v.end      codepre  pTaking into account these considerations, is there a way to implement the nested iterator semantics without having to store both end values or without the need to have three comparisons in the operatorp

Negative 33141 pWhen you dont have to deal with pointers, copyingmoving a struct into another one is quite easy.br In my case though, Ive to deal with pointers and access rights.p  precodeprotected           addrinfo hints, result ... hints  new addrinfo ... getaddrinfo0, port.cstr,  hints, ampresult  result is protected  cant do that. codepre  pcodememmovememcpycode can be used, but codeaddrinfocode contains a pointer to codesockaddrcode inside itself. I thought to use a temporary struct to pass codegetaddrinfocode and then move everything to coderesultcode, but the question is always there.br Tell me if you need some other details.p  pEDIT Mike Woolf youve given me an idea. Since the base class is an abstract one, I can even make those structs public, since the user would have no way to istantiate it. Thanks however for the answer.p

It needs to be codepickermultiplecode if its a select multiple box. And so on.p  pIs this possible to do in the template view Were working with a framework which is why I dont want to just target the form fields differently with CSS, but wed like the core code to work without the framework which, I think, is why we wouldnt want to do this sort of thing in the separate Python file.p  pAs for what Ive tried, I noticed that code field.field.widget code renders something like codeltdjango.forms.widgets.Select object at 0x10d822a50gtcode.

The reason I am asking is because I want to be able to see what datafrom the second table has not been merged with table one. p

However when I use these I lose some of my data on output it appears it cuts it short. Again, I have allocated 4096 bytes to the pointer and that should be plenty to output correctly. p  pPerhaps Im incrementing my pointer incorrectly or printing it out incorrectlyp

Negative 33141 pWhen I first came here I knew less than nothing.  Now Im somewhat functional.  Ive asked for help on this issue before but the variety of answers Ive received have turned out to be more confusing than helpful.  p  pIm a DJ and I have set up a database for my music on my web space.  I built an HTML form to enter the info for each song.  Unless you know the address you cant find the form.  However, when I hit an apostrophe it fails to write.  I have been given a host of remedies PDO, htmlentities, sanitize, etc. but as I read more about them Im told they are depreciated.  Or I get suggestions to move over to PDO.  Im still trying to learn PHP and at my age thats all I can handle right now.  p  pCould someone please just tell me what commands I need to use to sanitize if thats right the input so MySQL will accept it  Or tell me a location where I can learn the syntax to make it work. No one else uses the form and if someone found it theres no big deal as I copy the DB to my home computer after Id entered more music.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 33141 pThis is related to the question I posted a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions23294985qtcannotgetftptoopendirectorycorrectlyherea, but I hadnt gotten much visibility for that question so I wanted to ask in a more general way. I have a Qt 4.7 project that utilizes QFtp functionality. Until very recently we were using this with an FTP server that was vsftpd. Everything worked fine with it then. However, several days ago we moved the server to a new computer. All the contents are identical, but now it uses pureftpd instead of vsftpd. Since the move, none of my QFtp code works properly. Is there any known problems that arise when trying to use QFtp with this type of FTP server I cant find anything helpful online, and its rather frustrating not being able to find anything wrong with the code and yet having it not work. If anyone knows anything about this and could please share, Id appreciate it a lot. Thanksp

Negative 33141 pI have a main report with 2 sub reports in it.I have two data sources as json restful service. Now I made two parameters in main report which hold the above data sources. I passed one each parameter to each of the two sub reports. But the problem is  when I deploy and run the report in jasper server  the two parameters are evaluated twice each. Means my json restful services are called four times two for each parameter. p  pI have some filters also attached to all the services which are configured as input controls  these have some default values and are part of my restful service data source URL...BUT when I change any filter  the services run exacatly once for each.p  pThus in nut shell  first run of report evaluates the parameters twice but after first run if i just change filters it runs one time for each service.p  pcan someone please throw some light on it  I want that each data source param should be evaluated just once  as it takes time for my service to return data.p

Negative 33141 pI am programing in .NET using C and I have 3 drop downs. Depending on the contents of the first two dropdowns determines the value of the 3rd. The user cannot change the 3rd, it is populated automatically. Lets call these Dropdowns A. B and C. If A has any value selected, C gets a value of X automatically. If A is blank and B has any value selected, C gets a value of Y. Now if A gets selected, then B gets selected, C should have a value of X. Thus if A has any value it supersedes what is in B. How do you do this I have programmed some events but I have no idea how to make it so B needs to check what is checked in for A before determing the value of C. Hope this didnt sound too confusing.p

Negative 33141 pI am still using Visual Studio 2012, creating ASP.Net MVC 4 applications. p  pWhen I create a new project, many all of the default added NuGet packages are out of date. If I go to the package manager console and submit ap  precodeUpdatePackage codepre  pcommand, then everything updates just fine, but the project will no longer run. You can spend the next several hours then trying to recover from that state.

Negative 33141 pI have a USB connecting camera that I am writing an application for. I am using OPENCV to capture frames from the camera and Qt to manage the GUI interface.p  pUVC appears to support these things called Extension Units that a vendor may make with a camera. I have a camera with an extension unit that is said to control the focus, exposure, white balance, and other settings of the camera.p  pI do not know much about DirectShow or the like, but I was able to follow examples and use it as well as OpenCV elsewhere in my code, which is what I have typically used to set things like brightness and contrast. But for these more specific Extension Unit controls, I have no idea. I have a list of what I believe are properties that can be set, for example EXEXPOSUREMODE and the range of values that it can be set to. However, I do not know how to access and set them in my code with DirectShow.

It lists the available properties near the end, but not how to manually set them.

Negative 33141 pI have a swift project with a storyboard using Size Classes, a ViewController which conforms to the UITraitEnvironment protocol and have implemented the function codetraitCollectionDidChangecode.p  pWhen I first launch the app codetraitCollectionDidChangecode is called which seems reasonable  it allows developers to handle the first size class presented by the application, however the codepreviousTraitCollectioncode variable passed to it is codenilcode. I cant check that this value is codenilcode as its NOT optional, and accessing it in any way causes a crash. Changing the parameter to optional in the function declaration causes a build error, complaining that I have not implemented required methods in the protocol.p  pFor now I have managed to work around this by creating a separate function which takes an optional variable of the same type that I can then check against, but I would like to know why this is happening. p  pIf its any use to anyone at all, here is the function I am overridingp  precodeoverride func traitCollectionDidChangepreviousTraitCollection UITraitCollection       Accessing previousTraitCollection causes a crash  codepre  pCan anyone shed any light on thisp

Negative 33141 pThere are numerous suggestions around the web that Cassandra is not a good choice when it comes to persistent scalable queues, including this one from DataStax a hrefhttpwww.datastax.comdevblogcassandraantipatternsqueuesandqueuelikedatasets relnofollowhttpwww.datastax.comdevblogcassandraantipatternsqueuesandqueuelikedatasetsap  pYet very few places mention an alternative. And I think I might need one.p  pSpecifically my scenario is There are tasks lets say 100 millions of them that need to be executed at some point in the future. Each task has therefore an associated runAt property and tasks need to run at their runAt time passes but small delays are allowed. As tasks complete they need to be removed from the queue. At the same time new tasks are added to the queue at some arbitrary rate lets say 100ssec or more with arbitrary runAt values between now and 1 year from now.p  pA possible implementation would make use of Cassandras ability to order the columns within a row and use some variant of the readdelete technique that is read the top of the queue, execute the tasks and remove them from the queue, which closely resembles the mentioned antipattern. p  pSo what would make most sense Try tuning the suggested workarounds to the point that would make this particular problem work at the expected scale Or a completely different piece of technology would be more suitable for the jobp  pAny helpadvice would be appreciated.p

Its working but is a hack.p  pThe pattern Im using, each module project you create an class that inherits from AreaRegistion.  When each module project builds, relevant files are copied to the Areas folder of the main web project.  Then when the main project loads, reflection is used to load all module assemblies.  Then when AreaRegistration.RegisterAllAreas is called, it detects and loads all the modules with a class that inherits AreaRegistration.p  pId like to figure out an good way to access the Ninject kernel and add bindings in the module class that inherits from AreaRegistration.  I would imagine initiating code to add bindings from the RegisterArea override.p  pIm looking for any suggestions on how to do this without resorting to the ServiceLocator.p  pAny ideas would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 33141 pis there any way to compare strings starting from first char not comparing chars inside a existing string.p  pexample I have array with Boobo, Frodo, Ookami Waki, Konsta, Perrys, Ami.  And when i have default search filter, after typing O in input i will get Boobo, Frodo, Ookami, Konsta because they have o letter inside.  What i want is to get only Ookami, because this name starts with o, after typing.  Strict comparison isnt a solution, because i would have to type whole name to get it showed.p

Negative 33141 pI am coding in node.js for 6 months. I have read about concept of asynchronous coding, event loops and callbacks and so on. I know  asynchronous code will never execute while the synchronous code stack is executing. This is the meaning of node.js being singlethreaded. But here is one example p  precodevar a  [4, 5, 6, 7] var results  []  a.forEachfunctionresult   results.pushresult  1   console.logresults codepre  pAs far as I understand, argument to a function forEach is callback which is called later after the synchronous block finishes executing. That means I expect the result will be p  precode[] codepre  pbut it is infact p  precode[5, 6 ,7, 8] codepre  pWhy is this happening Is forEach synchronous Or I am missing something In my understanding,p  precodeconsole.logresults codepre  pWill be executed before data is pushed into it.p

Negative 33141 pI have three main models. Users, photos, and relationships.p  pThe relationship model consists of two fields  fromuser, touser. When userA fromuser follows UserB touser, I would like to display other accounts that are similar to userB to userA. userA will be more inclined to follow accounts that are similar to userB. What method should I implement in order to come with this list of similar accountsp  pThe first example that I could immediately think of was Instagram amp Twitter which show similar accounts right after you follow a user. I was thinking perhaps the suggested accounts that they show are the result of multiple set intersections. p  pDoing set intersections between all of the following sets of UserBs followers might be a possible solution. This would generate a set showing all the common users that UserBs followers follow. When this set is presented to userA, userA might also be inclined to follow people on this set since userBs followers also follow them. My logic here is that userBs followers might share a common interest. This common interest is probably one of the reasons why they followed userB in the first place. It is very likely that userBs followers might also follow other accounts similar to userB. p  pThe whole reason for why I even started thinking about this is because of a question I found on a hrefhttpwww.quora.comHowdoesthepeopletofollowsuggestionsalgorithmworkonserviceslikeFacebookInstagramorTwitter relnofollowQuoraa the other day.p  pOne user mentionedp  pem1. The people who the people you follow follow.  The overwhelming majority of my use for Twitter is following media people to know what theyre working on.  Most of the suggestions are accounts that they follow.emp  pem2. Matched email.  Someone you know uploaded their address book or email activity for mining and you were on the list.  LinkedIn really seems to like this one, because most of the recommendations are people I dont actually know, but I briefly interacted with them via email years back.emp  pAs some of you have suggested, this is probably an open ended question, but I decided to give it a crack on stack to see what other implementations some of you have employed. If this question is not fit for stack overflow, please help me direct it to somewhere it would be, perhaps another stack exchange community. p  pThank youp

While we are doing so, Ive been given a query to list the overlapping bookings for the past two months so we can manually address them.p  pMy problem is that this query takes forever 5 minutes to run and the bookings system grinds to halt while it does so to the detriment of our users. So Id like to improve its performance. p  pThe relevant schema is pseudocoded below. There are two key tables and their respective columns.p  precodeBookings                        Accounts ID  int                        ID  int Status  bool                   Status  bool StartTime  datetime            Name  varchar EndTime  datetime RoomID  int MemberID  int AccountID  int  PK ID                          PK ID Index StartTime, EndTime,         MemberID, AccountID,        RoomID, Status codepre  pThe keys are all simple keys ie. no compound keys. Bookings.AccountID is a foreign key into Accounts.ID.p  pThe query is roughlyp  precodeSELECT b1.AccountID, a.Name, b1.ID, b2.ID, b1.StartTime, b1.EndTime, b1.RoomID FROM Bookings b1 LEFT JOIN Bookings b2 ON b1.MemberID  b2.MemberID    AND b1.RoomID  b2.RoomID    AND b2.StartTime gt SUBDATENOW, INTERVAL 2 MONTH  LEFT JOIN Accounts a ON b1.AccountId  a.ID  WHERE b1.ID  b2.ID AND b1.Status  1 AND b2.Status  1 AND b1.StartTime gt SUBDATENOW, INTERVAL 2 MONTH  AND    b1.StartTime gt b2.StartTime AND b2.EndTime lt b1.EndTime AND b1.StartTime lt b2.EndTime OR   b1.StartTime lt b2.StartTime AND b2.EndTime gt b1.EndTime AND b2.StartTime lt b1.EndTime OR   b2.StartTime lt b1.StartTime AND b2.EndTime gt b1.EndTime  codepre  pAs far as I can tell, the query essentially joins the bookings table to itself for the past two months and attempts to eliminate distinct bookings. That is, it looks for valid status1 bookings belonging to the same member for the same room where the duration of the bookings overlap.p  pThe last three clauses look for a a booking starting during the other and finishing after b a booking starting before the other and finishing during and c a booking wholly contained within the other. This appears to omit for mine a booking wholly around the other although Im not sure why.p  pThe bookings table is very large 2m rows as it has years of bookings data in it. Can the performance of this query be improved or replaced with a better one Any suggestions welcome.p

I found something similar but still not what I needp  precode    matlab nodisplay nosplash nodesktop r run whatever.m codepre  pIt starts a new screen with nothing but MATLABs own terminal instead of just running the code on CMD like R, mySQL and other programs do.p  pActually what Im trying to achieve is to run some of MATLABs code on Java. Im aware theres a way to create a .jar, .dll, .exe,..., out of an strongcode.mcodestrong file, but I need to do it on some other way. My idea was to get the results that MATLAB throws on CMD, but it just starts MATLAB, runs the code and I get no results on java using codeProcessBuildercode. That reads whatever would come out on the console, but as its MATLABs console its not possible to get any results. Thats why I need a way to run it straight on CMD.p

Negative 33141 pHi I am trying to follow a tutorial on adding buttons for navigation to a view controller that has a tableview in it and am having problems.p  pNick Kuhs tutorial from the book iPhone App Development says you can take a view controller with a tableview in it and simply drag a fresh uiview onto the view controller as a child of the main view controller.  Then after sizing it, he says you can add buttons etc. to it. He says you may have to fiddle with storyboard to make the fresh UIView a child of the main view controller as opposed to the tableview but if you have problems you just use the document panel.  Finally he says to make the new view clear in color and place it below the tableview so it appears on top.  As a result of its size and location, however, it should not block the tableview and you should end up seeing a tableview and buttons on the same screen.p  pHowever, when I try to do this my tableview is either hidden if I make the view a child of the main controller or if it displays, fails to display any records.p  pHas anyone seen this problem before and can you confirm that it is possible to have a tableview and uiview with buttons in the same main controllerp  pNote I first tried this with a fullblown tableviewcontroller but discovered you cant resize the tableview in a tableviewcontroller.  So I put a tableview in a view controller and am now trying to add a uiview to it without any luck.p  pThanks in advance for any suggestions.p

Negative 33141 pIm using codephpwordcode library to print data from database by using template. I  realized that codephpwordcode does not replace any of the keywords with my input so I  searched what causing it and found that word generates arbitrary tags around my keywords so codephpwordcode fails to find my keys.p  pThen I changed my templates format from code.docxcode to codezipcode to open codedocument.xmlcode file to erase unnecessary tags around my keyword but I cannot open codedocument.xmlcode, it says there is an error in row 2 but whole codeXMLcode file is in row 2 so it is impossible to find where is the error.p  pSome suggested that use codenotepadcode and codexmlplugincode to regenerate codeXMLcode file with proper line breaks. I did it but error still shows the same row and I cant find the error, also I used online tools to check whether there is an error or not in my codedocument.xmlcode but those tools says your codeXMLcode file is fine, sorry for the long explanation, thanks in advance.p

Negative 33141 pI faced with a strange problem. I write ASP.NET web application.  I have form tag on the aspx page and submit in the form. When I click on the submit forms data are posted. It is ok. But if I close the page right after submit and then reopen it with Main Menu  Recent Tabs I use Google Chrome the forms submit fires once again and data are posted too. I would like to avoid this behavior because repeated posting data to server is unwelcome and unexpected. It happens after select Recent Tabs only when  I prress CtrlShiftT it does not happen How could I prevent it Thanks in advancep

I made a windows 8 recovery drive and went to town trying startup repair got startup repair could not repair the problem, Refresh Got The partition where windows is installed is locked. There are no restore points or anything like that available. p  pI tried all of the boot commands in CMD to fix this issue directly, they all read that they finished correctly but the problems persisted. Next i tried repairing the boot files manually via CMD since this is my only workable option now but i got stuck dont remember where, but i could find out for you.p  pThe caveat here is that there are files that I need on this machine. So, I cant wipe the computer and do a fresh installation of the OS, but at the same time Im not sure i could remove the HDD and retrieve the files where i could put it back and have the machine in working order again. We would need to purchase an enclosure and an adapter. Im really stuck between a rock and a hard place.p  pToday, I came into work and thought Why cant I just copy the files in CMD I gave this a shot and was not able to find the file specified by my colleague. p  pSo my Question is How can i scan for a specified file name i was able to search through the files, but there were WAY too many to show on the Command Line and which copy command would be best for programming data If youve read this far I appreciate it. Any feedback would be great. I know this is a lot to process but this is my last chance before i give up on this completely.p  pThanks,p  pDylanp

Negative 33141 pI am currently learning Javascript and I have problem on object association. p  pThe codes can be found in jsfiddle a hrefhttpjsfiddle.nethphchan94ajjbur2 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.nethphchan94ajjbur2a.p  pHere I highlight some of the essential parts of my codes.  I create a ball and a number of blocks using constructor functions. To get the ball notice it hits the blocks, I put block object as one of the input to create Ball object, like this p  pcodevar ball  new Ball20, 20, 000, 2, 5, objArraycodep  pwhere objArray includes a number of block Objects and a spinner object. And I create a method of Ball object, which is ballMove which creates a ball and moves and bounce back if it hit anything. p  pAnd I want to do the following p  ol liwhen the ball hit the spinner, nothing happens just the ball get bounce back. li liwhen the ball hit the block, the block get disappear. li ol  pHere are the essential code for block to be disappear p  pIn JS p  precodefunction Ballwidth, height, color, speedX, speedY, relatedObjArray       Item.callthis, width, height, color       this.relatedObjArray  relatedObjArray      ...   Ball.prototype  new Item   Ball.prototype.ballMove  function      var relatedObjArray  this.relatedObjArray     ...     setIntervalfunction          ...         if relatedObj.className  block visible              relatedObj.className  block hidden              relatedObjArray.splicei, 1                 codepre  pIn CSS p  precode.hidden      visibility hidden  codepre  pThe codes I wrote run perfectly. However, in order to make the block disappear, I put the code which makes the block disappear in moveBall, which is a method inside Ball, instead of Block. p  pIndeed, I would like to put the code to make the block disappear inside the Block constructor function, since this is an activity relates more with Block than ball.  I would like to create a method for Block instead. It should looks something like this p  precodeBlock.prototype.hiddenBall  function      if touches ball          block.className  block hidden          removeBlock in the Object Array   codepre  pwhile leaving moveBall method the capability of bouncing back only. p  pHowever, I have no idea how I can do this. Since I create the Block first, then Ball. So that I can put the Block objects as an input of Ball. So how can I do the opposite as well, putting Ball as an input of Block, so that I can make the Block disappear when it detects it is hit by the ball OR are there any alternative way to do it p

Negative 33141 pIm trying to replace a Backbone.Marionette App to React and am facing difficulty thinking about query params.  I think Im missing a really simple peace in understanding this pattern so I apologize if this question is totally nonsense.  I would appreciate any support or just pointing me to some direction that I can google more specifically.p  pTheres a codeuserscode page which lists users and you can filter the users via search bar.  So if you want to filter the users which contain joe in their username, I would make a request to the server with query params like codeusersusernamejoecode.

However, I would like the Client to be able to bookmark the current filtered result and be able to come back to the same page some time later.  This means I will need somewhere to save explicit information about the search term the Client made, which is usually the url am I right. So I will need to update the url with query parameters to save the search term  codeusersusernamejoeamppage1code.p  pWhat Im confused is where and when to update the url  What I can come up with right now are the 2 options below  and they dont seem to be clean at all.p  h1Option 1h1  ol liThe Client inserts codejoecode to the input element and clicks strongSearchstrong.li liClicking the strongSearchstrong button fires a transition of the ReactRouter with the new query params codeusersusernamejoeamppage1code.li liThe View codeComponentcode receives the new params via codethis.props.paramscode and codethis.props.querycode.li liThe View codeComponentcode fires an codeActioncode like codeAction.getUsercode depending on the query params it receives  in this case codeusernamejoeamppage1code.li ol  pemafter this, it is the same as aboveemp  h1Option 2 only 6 is different from what I explained aboveh1  ol liThe Client inserts codejoecode to the input element and clicks strongSearchstrong.li liClicking the strongSearchstrong button fires an codeActioncode like Action.getUser.li liThe codeActioncode makes a request to the server and receives the resultsli liThe codeDispatchercode dispatches a function with the results payload to whomever usually the codeStorecode is interested in the codeActioncode.li liThe codeStorecodes state changes with the new result received by the codeActioncodeli liThe View codeComponentcode rerenders by listening to the codeStorecodes change. strongAnd somehow I dont know how, yet updates its url depending on its codepropscode like codethis.props.searchusernamecode, and codethis.props.searchpagecodestrongli ol  pWhat is the best practice on handling query params or this may not be specific to query params Am I completely misunderstanding the design pattern or architecture  Thanks in advance for any support.p  pstrongSome articles Ive readstrongp  ul lia hrefhttpsgithub.comracktreactrouterissues822 relnofollowAny way to get current params or current query from router outside of componentali lia hrefhttpsgithub.comracktreactrouterissues530 relnofollowAsync data and Flux storesali lia hrefhttpsgithub.comracktreactrouterissues1100 relnofollowMake it easier to add query parametersali lia hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions28952422reactrouterandarbitraryqueryparamspagerefreshesunintentionallyonloadReact Router and Arbitrary Query Params Page Refreshes Unintentionally on Loadali lia hrefhttpsgithub.comracktreactrouterissues1126 relnofollowAdd default paramsali ul

Negative 33141 pIn our efforts to move from Java 6 u39 to Java 8 u51 we are facing an issue of longer warm up times for Java 8 compared to 6.p  pWe noticed this both with a performance test run as a Java program and also for the initial requests when starting Tomcat 7 u35 with Java 8.p  pWe are running on a Linux Redhat 64 bit system.p  pI am sorry I do not have any isolated test case.p  pRegarding the performance test program I found that Java 6 came close to steady state performance of around 215 milliseconds in 10 iterations whereas Java 8 was taking 800 milliseconds after 10 iterations and took 70 iterations to reach 215 ms.p  pWhen we ran JMeter tests at a concurrency of 10 on our tomcat webapp with Spring 2.5, jackson, xerces XML parser, jedis etc. immediately after restarting Java 6 took less than a minute to give steady state performance whereas Java 8 took around 56 minutes and was slower by several orders of magnitude till then.p  pTurning off Tiered Compilation using XXTieredCompilation VM HotSpot option in Java 8 fixed the warm up issue with the performance test Program with no change in steady state performance. This is surprising since Tiered Compilation is actually supposed to give faster warm up.p  pHowever turning off Tiered Compilation did not give similar improvement in warm up time for the Tomcat server.p  pI welcome any suggestion to fix this issue since deploying a new build in a live environment can become a hassle with a long warm up time.p  pThanks, Sureshp
