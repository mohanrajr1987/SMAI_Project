Positive 85786 pOk.  Asked this question yesterday and since started a whole new rails app to see if starting from scratch helps.  p  pHeres how this app works.

Positive 85786 pIf this is too broad I apologize and will understand if it needs closing. However, I couldnt find much to this specifically. Maybe Im missing something obvious. My app is already setup to catch user name and email when signing up with email confirmation. I also want an email list though that is separate from signup. For instance, I want people to be able to just sign up to the mailing list without necessarily signing up as a user on the app with names and password. I also want users who have signed up to not necessarily be on the mailing list either if they dont want to. Im just curious what the best way to go about doing this would be. Have a separate mailing list model with email and opt in opt out boolean Or maybe allow subscribers to be users without first and last name Is it bad practice to catch user emails in two different models Thanks. p

Positive 85786 pI am working on my first real Rails 4 app and I have run into a problem with my design. p  pCurrently I have a Service model which started out with attributes such as name, onlinestatus, ip, dnsname, port, and servicetype. This model has evolved to include many methods and attributes for specific servicetypes like authtokens, etc. and thus it is very overgrown. The columns added to the database to accommodate the needs of the different types of services make this model act like a ghetto version of STI without separate classesmodels.p  pThe Service model also has methods such as ping which is used to determine the onlinestatus. I believe the types of services are different enough to warrant their own separate tables because each service seems to have many unique properties and methods.p  pExamplep  pA generic service has name, ip, dnsname, onlinestatus, etc...p  pA specific service such as Plex will have name, ip, dnsname, onlinestatus, username, password, authtoken, etc... p  pThe issue, is that I would like to be able to access the more specific types of services from their parent Service class. So when I create a view, I can loop through all the generic services and the more specific services as if they were all the same type of service or at least be able to access all services in some simple way without looping through each type and appending them. p  pI also need to access the specific types of models on their own, so doing something like couchpotatos.each in my view will only go through the instances of the Couchpotato class.p  pControllers play into this confusion too since I dont exactly know how to have a single page display all these different types of models from the same controller.p
Positive 85786 pIm reviewing some code and I came across a line that does the followingp  precodePerson.findbyname Tom.id codepre  pThe above code gets the FIRST record with a name of Tom, then builds a model, then gets the id of that model.  Since we only want the id, the process of retreiving all data in the model and initializing the model is unneeded.  Whats the best way to optimize this using active record queries  p  pId like to avoid a raw sql solution.  So far I have been able to come up withp  precodePerson.wherename Tom.pluckid.first codepre  pThis is faster in some situations since codepluckcode doesnt build the actual model object and doesnt load all the data.  However, codepluckcode is going to build an array of records with name Tom, whereas the original statement only ever returns a single object or nil  so this technique could potentially be worse depending on the codewherecode statement.  Id like to avoid the array creation and potential for having a very long list of ids returned from the server.  I could add a codelimit1code in the chain,p  precodePerson.wherename Tom.limit1.pluckid.first codepre  pbut is seems like Im making this more complicated than it should be.p

Negative 85786 pI would like to insert a calculation in Excel using Python. Generally it can be done by inserting a formula string into the relevant cell. However, if i need to calculate a formula multiple times for the whole column the formula must be updated for each individual cell. For example, if i need to  calculate the sum of two cells, then for cell Ck the computation would be AkBk. In excel it is possible to calculate C1A1B1 and then automatically expand the  calculation by dragging the mouse from C1 downwards. My question is Is it possible to the same thing with Python, i.e. to define a formula in only one cell and then to use Excel capabilities to extend the calculation for the whole columnrowp  pThank you in advance, Sashap

I do not have direct network connectivity to any of them.

Negative 85786 pLets say I have information in a table that is in the wrong database like Customer info in the Items database. I really want to move this information, but I need to figure out whos using it. If I use this code to search for the table name, say CustomerContactNumbers, is there any possibility of things slipping by Im going to ignore any composed SQL thats happening outside of the database, I can do a text search in source control for that plus dont you think they deserve to have their code broken in that case.

Negative 85786 pUsing Delphi 2007 and TMS components for Unicode utils and interface upgrading to Delphi 2009 for Unicode support is not an option.p  pIm storing a list of filenames in a string list TTntStringList. Its sorted and case insensitive. The default sort routine uses CompareStringWLOCALEUSERDEFAULT, NORMIGNORECASE, ... to compare strings and the same for Find. However, this is a problem because that will equate dummyss.txt with dummy.txt for example, but on NTFS its perfectly legal to have those two files in the same folder, i.e. they are treated as different names.p  pMy understanding is that on Vista and newer, the correct way to compare filenames is to use CompareStringOrdinal. Is this correctp  pOn preVista systems, what would be the correct way I believe it should be CompareStringWLOCALEINVARIANT, ... but Im not entirely sure.p  pThanksp

Thank you, both of you, for your help. p  pI have basically achieved what I set out to do with the program. But now, I want to make it better by having it operate in a multithreaded way. Do any of you have any suggestions as to what aspect of such a magic square program could be delegated to separate threads. p  pAs of now, what the program does is this prompt the user for the square size  build n x n grid and when user clicks a start button, it starts timing the user. while the user inputs a new entry, the board constantly updates the totals on each row, column and diagonal and updates the appropriate boxes. Finally, when the check for a successful magic square board turns out true, it disables all the textfields and lets the user start a new game or exit. p  pOnce again, while I have programmed in Java for a while, my knowledge is very limited and right now, I want to understand how simple programs like these, while they work well on a single thread, can be built in a multithreaded way. p  pLastly, I was checking the Memory used when I run my program basically looking through task manager in windows, under javaw.exe and for a grid of 19 x 19, it says about 19000K. Is this too much or about right and if its too much, how can I reduce it p  pThank you greatly for any help. p

Negative 85786 pIm implementing a document viewer with highlightingannotation capabilities for a custom document format on iPad. The documents are kind of long 100 to 200 pages, if printed on paper and Ive had a hard time finding the right approach. Here are the requirmentsp  p1 Basic richtext styling control of leftright margins. Control of font name, size, foregroundbackground color, and line spacing. Bold, italics, underline, etc.p  p2 Selection and highlighting of arbitrary text regions not limited to paragraph boundaries, like in SafariUIWebView.p  p3 Customization of the CutCopyPaste popup UIMenuController This is one of the essential requirements of the app.p  pMy first implementation was based on UIWebView. I just rendered the document as HTML with CSS for text styling. But I couldnt get the kind of text selection behavior I wanted across paragraph boundaries and the UIMenuController cant be customized from within UIWebView.p  pSo I started working on a javascript approach, faking the device textselection behavior using JQuery to trap touch events and dynamically modifying the DOM to change the background color of selected regions of text. I built a fake UIMenuController control as a hidden DIV, positioning it and unhiding it whenever there was an active selection region.p  pNot too shabby.p  pThe main problem is that its SLOOOOOOOW. Scrolling through the document is nice and quick, but dynamically changing the DOM is not very snappy. Plus, I couldnt figure out how to recreate the magnifier loupe, so my fake textselection GUI doesnt look quite the same as the native implementation. Also, I havent yet implemented the communication bridge between the javascript layer and the objectivec layer where the rest of the app lives, but it was shaping up to be a huge hassle.p  pSo Ive been looking at CoreText, but there are precious few examples on the web. I spent a little time with this simple little demop  pa hrefhttpgithub.comjonasschnelliI7CoreTextExample relnofollowhttpgithub.comjonasschnelliI7CoreTextExampleap  pIt shows how to use CoreText to draw an NSAttributedText string into a UIView. But it has its own problems It doesnt implement textselection behavior, and it doesnt present a UIMenuController, so I dont have any idea how to make that happen. And, more importantly, it tries to draw the entire document all at once, with significant performance degradations for long documents. My documents can have thousands of paragraphs, and less than 1 of the document is ever on screen at a time.p  pOn the plus side, these documents already contain precise formatting information. I know the exact pageposition of every line of text, so I dont need a layout engine.p  pDoes anyone know how to implement this sort of view using CoreText I understand that a fullfledged implementation is overkill for a question like this, but Im looking for a good CoreText example with a few basic requirementsp  p1 Precise layout amp formatting control using the formatting metrics and text styles Ive already calculated.p  p2 Arbitrary selection of text.p  p3 Customization of the UIMenuController.p  p4 Efficient recycling of resources for offscreen objects.p  pId be happy to implement my own recycling when text elements scroll offscreen, but wouldnt that require reimplementing UIScrollViewp  pIm brandnew to iPhone development, and still getting used to ObjectiveC, but Ive been working in other languages Java, C, flexactionscript, etc for more than ten years, so I feel confident in my ability to get the work done, if only I had a better feel for the iPhone SDK and the common coding patterns for stuff like this.

Negative 85786 pOK. Im in essense trying to make my own interpretation of the NES hardware, so I can make a game that ideally would resemble what a NES game would look like.  Im currently stuck with how to adjust how to draw the playfield to the video memory back buffer.p  pstrongBACKBUFFERstrongp  pThe NES had restrictions on the nametable, or backbuffer.  For my example, the backbuffer is 256x240pixels big, or the size of one screen.  If I drew this to the TV, it would fill up the screen perfectly.  Now, if I drew this to the screen with an offset of X5, the entire image would be shifted and would wrap around the screen.p  pFor example.....p  precodeORIGINAL, NO OFFSET                      DRAWN WITH OFFSET OF X5 ABCDEFGHIJK                               GHIJKABCDEF  DRAWN WITH OFFSET OF X5 FGHIJKABCDE codepre  pThe screen is split up into squares 8x8 pixels each, totalling 32x30 rows and columns.  256x240 pixels.  The offset is represented in pixels  not columns so in theory, I could offset the screen by 5 pixels and every column would be shifted to the right by five pixels.p  pstrongLEVEL DESIGNstrongp  pMy stages are made up of screens, containing data that is represented in 16x15 rows and columns, each by 16x16 pixels.  This is to emulate how many NES games stored level data  each tile holds info about what should be in each 8x8 block.p  pE.g.p  precodeAA BC     with A,B,C,D representing what 8x8 graphic should go where codepre  pLevel design is represented by this as well, with each number being a different screen and  meaning nothing, null.p  precode 123 4 54  codepre  pstrongCHARACTER PLACEMENTstrong This is easy.  I already know how I can determine which table, row, and column my characters are on based on their absolute positioning.  I can also determine the relative positioning within the screen.p  pWith this info, I can easily figure out which columns are to the left and right of the character, if any if the character is at the left side of screen 1, thered be no more level leftp  pstrongSO HERES THE QUESTION DUN DUN DUNstrong How do I draw my levels to the screen, so that they scroll from one to the next. It would be relatively easy to draw one full screen at a time, and when the character gets to the edge just flip to another screen.p  pHowever, the problem Im conceptually having is that I need to stream the level data onto the screen.  That, lets say the character moves 24 pixels to the right.  The BG needs to move as well.p  pSo, I need to adjust the scrolling of the backbuffer by 24 pixels.  However, just scrolling alone will cause the screen to wrap over, diplsaying old portion of the level.  So, while scrolling I need to make sure to draw new pieces of the level to the back buffer.  But before I can do that, I need to figure out which tiles need to get drawn first.  And if the person goes 24 pixels to the left, I need to redraw tiles onto the backbuffer and change the offset accordingly as well.p  pAnd lets not forget that if the character moves right and theres no more level data to be drawn, there should be no offset but instead the character gets closer to the side of the screen instead of being centered in the middle of the screen via the X axis.p  pBasically, I just have a lot of different numbers and values stuck in my mind right now  trying to wrap my head around many concepts and they caused my brain to turn into goo.  Anyone have any perspective on how I can approach thisp  pEDIT  Using VB.Net.  C is applicable as well  I program in bothp

Negative 85786 pwe have a Java software to receive and send customer and contracts data from and to our servers. The software runs in a web browser. Sometimes our agents complain about the lag, but it is related to their network connection. Its our thought to build in some kind of network monitor to show the current network speed. My first thought was it to implement a java version of the Ping program to measure the time before the ping and after the ping. With this information I would have been able to calculate the connection speed. The problem is that Java doesnt support SOCKRAW type sockets so I cant send ICMP packets. Due to security reasons I can not create some kind of UDP clientserverconnection to use UDP sockets. The servers with our customer and contract data is not modifiable due to security reasons so you cant use any sockets at all. In my opinion there doesnt seem to be a convenient way to solve this with Java. My colleage has another approach. He thought about downloading a picture to measure the download time but this is no good solution to permanently measure the connection speed.p  pSo are there any usable possibilities to measure the connection speed with Java JSF,JSP or Javascript jquery and embed it on a web sitep

This is kind of a dangerous behavior for PHP, more on that explained below.p  pI have the following two things in mind for why I want to do thisp  ol liI dont want the redundancy of defining all of the properties in all of the child classes.li liI want properties to be defined as defaults in the parent class and I want the child class definition to be able to override these properties wherever needed. The child class needs to exclude properties whenever the defaults are intended, which is why I dont define the properties in the child classes in the above example.li ol  pHowever, if we are wanting to override a property at runtime via the init method, it will override it for the parent class From that point forward, child classes initialized earlier as in the case of Brother unexpectedly change on you.p  pApparently this is a result of child classes not having their own copy of the static property whenever it isnt explicitly defined inside of the child classbut instead of throwing an error it switches behavior of emstaticem to access the parent. Therefore, strongis there some way that the parent class could dynamically create a property that belongs to the child class without it appearing inside of the child class definitionstrong That way the child class could have its own copy of the static property and the static keyword can refer to it properly, and it can be written to take into account parent property defaults.p  pOr is there some other solution, good, bad, or uglyp

Negative 85786 pIm looking for a solution to guarantee client response time with varnish, without limiting backend response time.p  pI have around 100 different resources httphostresource.jsid1 etc. which on average compute within a second on a backend. The resources are cached by varnish so each of them can be served to many clients concurrently. The resources are included as synchronous page blocking javascript, so the responses should be served fast e.g. 3 seconds. Because I would like to guarantee client response time, I could not think of a better solution than to configure the backend timeout on this 3 seconds. An example vcl looks likep  precodebackend mybackend    .host  127.0.0.1   .port  8080   .connecttimeout  100ms   .firstbytetimeout  3s   .betweenbytestimeout  3s   .probe        .url  resourceid1      .timeout  3s      .window  4      .threshold  4      .interval  15s       sub vclrecv    set req.backend  mybackend   set req.grace  5d   return lookup   sub vclfetch    set obj.ttl  2m   set obj.grace  5d   return deliver    codepre  pMy problem is the following. After Ive stopped the backend for 5 minutes and restart it while varnish serves stale data within the grace period, many different resources out of TTL but within grace are fetched concurrently at the backend. This hits the database hard and none of the resources is delivered within 3 seconds and nothing gets cached. p  pHow do I avoid this problem I would like to guarantee a client response time but not limit backend response time.

Negative 85786 pI have recently become aware that I have no idea, genericly speaking, how a cc compiler works.  I will admit this initialy came from trying to understand header guards but came to the realization that I am lacking in how compiling works.p  pTake Visual C for instance  Theres the Header Files folder, the Resources Files folder, and Source Files folder.  Is there any significance to the separation of these folders and what you put in them  To me, they are all source files.  Take the code snippetsp  h1Snippet 1h1  precodea1.h int r4 codepre  pand p  precodea1.cpp int b  ltsemicolon left out on purpose codepre  pandp  precodemain.cpp include ltiostreamgt include a1.h void main     cout ltlt r  codepre  pThe compiler errors out saying a1.cpp3  fatal error C1004 unexpected endoffile found where I would expect it wouldnt because the a1.cpp file is not included where the main method exists where in the next code snippetp  h1Snippet 2h1  precodea1.h int r4 ltsemicolon left out on purpose codepre  pand p  precodea1.cpp int b  4   codepre  pandp  precodemain.cpp include ltiostreamgt void main     cout ltlt b  codepre  pErrors out because main.cpp6  error C2065 b  undeclared identifier.  If you include the a1.cpp like sop  h1Snippet 3h1  precodea1.h int r4 ltsemicolon left out on purpose codepre  pand p  precodea1.cpp int b  4   codepre  pandp  precodemain.cpp include ltiostreamgt include a1.cpp void main     cout ltlt b  codepre  pthe compiler complains a1.obj  error LNK2005 int b b3HA already defined in main.obj.  Both snippets 2 and 3 ignore the fact that codeint r  4code does not have a semicolon missing as I suspect that it has something to do with its a xxxx.h file. If I remove the a1.cpp file from the project on snippet 1, then it compiles fine. Clearly what I have expected is not what I am getting.  Theres plenty of books and tutorials on how to code in cpp, but not much in the way cpp handles files and source code in the complition process.  What on earth is going on herep
Negative 85786 pIm currently working with graphics and paths, and I can successufully display whatever I want.p  pBut instead of drawing a line directly on my SurfaceView, Id like to draw it progressively in an animation.p  pWhat Ive done so far is to create a Path and then to use PathMeasure to retrieve the coordinates progressively along the path.

Negative 85786 pI have an updown vote mechanism that is updated via ajax.

Now voting works and all, because when I refresh the page, it displays the correct vote count with the correct styling. However, the ajax has stopped working. How can I fix thisp
Negative 85786 pSorry in advance for the wall of textp  pScenariop  pWere looking at what technology to choose for a LOB app that needs to support a standalone model frontend  backend running on desktop machine, but also local server mode backend installed on a local server, as well as Software as a Service via the internet backend installed on a hosted server.p  pWe want to minimize the development work, which is why we chose the Silverlight frontend. We intend to reuse the same codebase for all 3 models.p  pThe LOB app is heavy on data inputs and will do some math work on the backend. We will have a large amount of views. And we will have a database with 80 tables. We currently have our own DAL that enables us to use MSSQL, MySQL and Oracle as DBMSs.p  pThe current vision is to use an Agile TDD Silverlight 4.0 MVVM app as frontend in C with the Caliburn framework. And to have a WCF RIA service as backend Non Silverlight, plain .NET 4.0. This fits the different models well, since its just a matter of where the backend is installed. For the SAAS model, we have a server on the internet where the backend could reside.p  pQuestions p  ol lipDoes this sound viable at all, or is it whishfull thinking that we could have the same codebase for the different modelspli lipWith regards to the backend, we are looking into WCF RIA Services, but would like to have Message Security, which does not seem to be possible in the Silverlight implementation of WCF. Is WCF RIA a valid choice Or is plain WCF better with regards to security in any waypli lipWith regards to the different DBMSs we need to support. Is this viable to do with WCF RIA Services Or are we better off creating our own BLLDAL and expose that ourselves via plain WCFpli lipDoes anyone have experience with a multiple DBMS setup using no inline SQL, just Stored Procedures The original app is heavy on inline SQL, but we are wondering how maintainable this app would be with only Stored Procedures in the different DBMSs.pli lipFinal question, with regards to MVVM and security, we would like to hide as much of our logic in the backend for securitycode protection reasons. What would be a logic thing to do for this We need to do TDD, so we need to be able to mockout the Model, which means it needs to be available in the frontend. But we need all the logic to be in the backend. Should we just use a wrapper in the frontend that links the real model in the backend Kind of a dummy model that fits 1on1 with the backend model. Or is there a better way to do thispli ol  pThanks in advance for any help you can give us in any of these subjectsp  pHuron.p

Negative 85786 pIm not sure if Im using the correct terminology to describe what Im looking for but its the best I could come up with.p  pEssentially I have a list of items that Im currently displaying in DIVs.  Im using the jQuery UI plugins and hooking up styles to toggle when the user hovers over each item.  Now Id like to have a small toolbarlike set of buttons appear in the upperright corner of each item when the mouse hovers over that item.  When the mouse moves up or down to the next item, the toolbar moves to that item.  Of course, it doesnt really move  Im assuming that Im toggling the visibility of a toolbar associated with each item.p  pThe latter point is due to a couple of factors including that the buttons are encoded with the id value for each list item so the command knows which item to work against.p  pWhat I need to know is how to create the HTML and CSS so that I can have a DIV with contents that are unaffected by the display of the toolbar.  And the markup and style settings to get the toolbar to appear in the upperright corner of each item, above the existing content.p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pI basically have a ltDIVgt wrapper that contains another ltDIVgt with text and another ltDIVgt that contains a set of image buttons images wrapped in anchors. What I need is the HTML and CSS so that the ltDIVgt or whatever other element is required to make it work containing the buttons appears to float in the topright corner of the parent ltDIVgt as shown in the picture belowp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comAXXpR.png altenter image description herep  pI can then use jQuery to show and hide the buttons when the item is hovered.p

For example using StrConvhtml, vbUnicode from VBA malformed all HTML tags and still didnt print polish chars well. br p  pI get the html data in such wayp  precodeDim xslt As New MSXML2.DOMDocument xslt.Load xsltfile Dim xmlDoc As New MSXML2.DOMDocument xmlDoc.loadxmlfile html  xmlDoc.transformNodexslt codepre  pand then pasting to the Word using functions given abovebr p  precodePutHTMLClipboard html, ,  where.Paste ClearClipboard codepre  pEDIT Probably the text get by xmlDoc.transformNode IS ANCII.

How could I transform this string to UTF8 Buildin StrConvstring,vUnicode does not works...p

Now my services can easily map EF POCO to view model with a single Mapper.Map call.p  pHas anyone tried this before What are potential pitfalls Does it make sense to keep all these LoadProperty calls in your servicerepository layers and keep AutoMapper mappings as simple as possible p  pWhat bothers me is that you can make AutoMapper do a lot of tedious work for you like converting types and looking up entities by IDs when converting from view model to POCO, but at the same time this moves this logic from your servicerepository to AutoMapper configuration. If you have extensive experience with this please do share your thoughts.p

Negative 85786 pIm writing a .Net app that will need to talk to a serial port device. The device is basically a transmitter for some old school alphanumeric pagers. Occasionally, my app will need to open up a serial port and send a message to the transmitter.p  pI know the protocol for talking to the device. Its a bit of a back and forth chatty protocol. Send a command ... wait for a particular response ... send another command ... wait for another particular response ... send the actual message ... wait for an accepted response.

Negative 85786 pApplication settings in Windows Forms is a convenient way to store applicationwide properties. However, on my current project, these settings are littered with color definitions which are more or less static, causing noise in app.config. Are there any good way of preventing settings from being written to app.config, simply relying on the default value p  pI tried moving the settings in question out as resources, but as far as I can tell, the Windows Forms designer in Visual studio provides no means of assigning color resource values to properties on controls.p

Negative 85786 pHad a question thought someone might have done this before, i have a wcf method that brings back an ienumerable collection of data that is binded to the item source of a datagrid. each record in the db is updated by the windows service regurarly untill the progress is completed, updating counts adding new records etc , each record on the grid reflects each record brought back,  currently the method brings back a list of data where each record is binded to a progress bar control in each row of the grid showing the progress of the work, however this is not live so the user has to press the refresh button each time which makes a wcf call to bring back the updated or new data, here comes my question how can i or whats the easiest and best way to show the progress happening on the control live without a refresh button, so the binding to the control updates and make it seem livep  pThanks in advancep

Negative 85786 pI want to store infinity number of java codeBigIntegercodes in a storage from where I can fetch those data, do some operation, insert new data. The operation needs to be very fast. What will be the best choice of storage for this purposep  pThe application will start with a prime number 2 and will check the primality of the numbers by some algorithm. If it founds a prime then it will insert that into that storage. Using the stored primes it will find next one. This application will never stops. If one stops the application then whenever next time it launches it will start from there where it was stopped. In this sense it is infinitesimal.  p  pI think MySql, Oracle etc cant handle this kind of system. So is there any other data storage which can be used for this purposesp

The template is using TheId as a function to retrieve the id of the current post which effectively uses postid i think, closed the source now but either there is something overriding the post AFTER i change it, or my technique is not working right.p  pSo my question is, can you hook or override in anyway the current post the url matches using the addrewritetag technique...

Negative 85786 pI need to make an API for an application lets say Library Manager. Like many typical applications, it is made on top of an ORM tool which makes POJOs being persisted into dbms. Now I have to make API so that other developers can use it as a JAR. Lets say, we want users to add books to library.

For example, I want to expose book.getPages but not book.deletePageint pageNop  pb Create duplicate objects specially for API layer. Only interface will be exposed.p  pc Not expose Objects at all. API is used using parameters.

If some operation is to be performed on the POJO, it will be called from BookManager. For example, ClockManager.startString clockName. It also give flexibility like having methods like startAll in ClockManager.p  p3 Finally, should BookManager contain a method for update, or it should be present in Book itself update means saving the configuration into the database.

Negative 85786 pThe task sounds trivial but bear with me.p  pThese are the buttons Im working withp  ul liGoogle 1li liFacebook Likeli liTwitter Tweetli liLinkedIn Shareli ul  pWith a little testing on webpagetest.org I found that its incredibly inefficient if you grab the snippet from each of these services to place these buttons on your page.  In addition to the images themselves youre also effectively downloading several JavaScript files in some cases multiple JavaScript files for just one button.  The total load time for the Facebook Like button and its associated resources can be as long as 2.5 seconds on a DSL connection.p  pNow its somewhat better to use a service like ShareThis as you can get multiple buttons from one source.  However, they dont have proper support for Google 1.  If you get the code from them for the Google 1 button, its still pulling all those resources from Google.p  pI have one idea which involves loading all the buttons when a generic looking Share button is clicked.  That way its not adding to the page load time.

Negative 85786 pIm wondering about where events should be set in a parentchild relationship. Its not a specific problem, just a best practices I guess. My specific casep  pI have a codeDropdowncode which contains of a codeButtoncode and a codeListcode. Describing the action, you press the button and the list appears. You click an item in the list, and that item is selected and the list disappears.p  pSo the first thing is that since the view is initialized as a codeDropdowncode, the person making it shouldnt need to reach in and deal with the codeButtoncode or codeListcode view. All methods should be called on the parent view, and events might need to be bubbled up from the child.p  pSo for example, instead of doing codethis.dropdown.button.presscode, codeDropdowncode provides its own codepresscode method which just calls codeButtoncodes press method.p  pWhen the user presses the button, codeButtoncode fires a codepresscode event that codeDropdowncode is listening to.p  precodeonButtonPress  function        if this.isExpanded          this.expand           this.triggerpress , codepre  pAnd codeDropdowncode triggers press on itself, so that developer can get the press event without reaching in to codedropdown.buttoncode.p  pHeres where the first question comes. Should codeDropdowncode expand itself in codeonButtonPresscode or should codeonButtonPresscode just trigger a press, and then have the expansion listening on codeDropdowncodes own codepresscode eventp  precodeonButtonPress  function        this.triggerpress ,  onPress  function        if this.isExpanded          this.expand      , codepre  pAnd then it gets more complicated, should codeDropdowncodes codeexpandcode method just trigger codeexpandcode on itselfp  precodeexpand  function        if this.isEnabled           this.setStateexpanded, true          this.triggerexpand           return this ,  onExpand  function        this.list.show , codepre  por should it be the one that codeshowcodes the codeListcodep  precodeexpand  function        if this.isEnabled           this.setStateexpanded, true          this.list.show          this.triggerexpand           return this , codepre  pI guess Im just wondering about best practices for deciding where to bind events in a parentchild relationship. How to avoid confusing situations and possibly circular event calling.p  pAnyone have any thoughtsp

Negative 85786 pI am currently producing a mobile web application which enables the user to walk with the application, and it will measure the distance covered straightline only.

Negative 85786 pIm creating an ad for a magazine on iPad that has a long timeline that needs to be controlled by a horizontal scrollbar. The scrollbar had to be custom, and the best plugin for custom scrolling that I could find that worked on iPads was fleXcroll. p  pMy problem is that Im trying to disable the ability for the user to swipe scroll the timeline. It needs to be exclusively controlled by the scrollbar since a swipe from the user should bring them to the next page of the magazine.p  pIve been looking at this problem for the past two days and the closest I can get to solving it at the moment is by controlling the touch events for the div. When I use event.preventDefault for touchstart and touchmove on the div it works partially. If the screen has not been moved, a swipe will not move the timeline. However, after using the scrollbar, if the timeline is still moving iPads have a sort of easing when things are swiped so that whatever is being moved slows down before stopping you can grab the timeline and move it by swiping it. Also, if you slowly let the scrollbar stop moving with your finger on it until it stops, you can then swipe the timeline again. p  pSo, the problem is preventing the ability for users to swipe a certain div to the side in a magazine ad for iPad. The scrolling should ONLY be controlled by the scrollbar. p  pAny help is greatly appreciated Thanksp

Im trying to do a simple text processor, and I want it to be able to select a font family from a JComboBox that populates itself based on the fonts a user has installed on their system. However, no matter what I try with experimenting, I cant figure out how to make it work. p  pWhat I have is a toolbar class that is built off of a JTextPane. Currently, it has a bunch of style buttons that work to set alignment and bold, italics and underline. p  pHeres my codep  precode  The StyleBar is used to customize styles in a Styled Document. It will take a  JTextPane as an argument for its constructor and then all actions to be taken  will affect the text in it.   author Andrew  public class StyleBar extends JToolBar       private JLabel fontLbl     private JComboBox fontBox           ...Irrelevant stuff to the problem at hand.            The initEvents method is used to initialize the necessary events for the      tool bar to actually do its job. It establishes the focus listener to the      buttons on the bar, and gives each one its individual functionality. It       also establishes the Font Selection interface.          public void initEvents          For each item in the tool bar, add the focus listener as well as the         formatting listeners         boldFormat.addActionListenernew StyledEditorKit.BoldAction boldFormat is         boldFormat.addActionListenerresetFocus                       a JButton          Ditto for my italicsFormat and underlineFormat buttons in the toolbar          leftAlign.addActionListenernew StyledEditorKit.AlignmentActionnull,                 StyleConstants.ALIGNLEFT         leftAlign.addActionListenerresetFocus    This listener just resets focus                                                     back onto the TextPane.          Ditto for my right and centerAlign buttons          Set up the Font list, and add a listener to the combo box         buildFontMenu                 The buildFontMenu detects all of the SYstems available fonts and adds       them to the Font Selection box.          public void buildFontMenu         GraphicsEnvironment ge                   GraphicsEnvironment.getLocalGraphicsEnvironment         final String[] fontNames  ge.getAvailableFontFamilyNames         for int i  0 i lt fontNames.length i             What do I do here to take the entry at String[i] and make it so that when             the user selects it it sets the font Family in a similar way to that of             pressing the boldFormat button or the leftAlign button                    Everything else is irrelevant codepre  pSo to sum up my problem I have no idea how to properly set the listener to the ComboBox such that a its sensitive to the individual font selected and b somehow uses StyledEditorKit.FontFamilyAction to make life easyp  pSlash, if Im approaching anything about this the wrong way, Id love to hear the right way. As I said, my sources on the internet arent very clear on the subject.p  pThanks so muchp

Negative 85786 pSo this is my first time posting here but Im more or less stumped. Basically what I have is an ext grid that loads a bunch of data. Among these columns are all these date fields. Start, Finish, Etc. Im trying to create a date picker to edit these columns. Ive experimented with the different ext component editors and I was able to hack together something that mostly worked but what I would really prefer is a way to use my own custom date picker or even better a third party solution like the JQuery UI date picker. p  pNeither extending nor overriding the editor seemed to do the trick. Im not so much looking for code but more whether this is even possible with ext and if so maybe to be pointed in the right direction. So has anyone ran into a similar problem Thanks in advance.p

Negative 85786 pI am trying to port an application from windows to linux.  In windows I have a codeGetEnvironmentStringscode function in windows.h which provides me the environment variables and their values in the current process in the form NAMEVALUE. For Linux I use the environ variable like thisp  precodefor char enenviron en en        stdstring stren     env.pushbackstr      env is a vector of strings  codepre  pstill the application doesnt seem to work. In windows when I print the size of string passed to the env vector a vector of strings it prints the size of all the strings as 48 bytes.    whereas on Linux the size is 8. The original application uses the Unicode version codeGetEnvironmentStringsWcode and     translate the returned widestring to an 8bit string using a conversion function codeWideCharToMultiBytecode.p  pI dont have enough knowledge abt character encodings, but I guess it has something to do with the way strings are encoded.     Any idea what could be going wrongp

Negative 85786 pI am new to R so I am struggling with what I imagine is a fairly simple question. For this question I am not looking for someone to give me just a solution. I was hoping that someone could explain the answer to me, so that I might learn to do it myself, rather than just copy what it is you have done. That being said, here is my problem and questions.p  pI am making a histogram with R. A user will submit a file and data from that file will be used to make a histogram. That much is already set and done. Where I am having a problem is that I need to take only part of that file name and use it to help make a title for the histogram. The file name is a bit of a monster and follows this naming convention p  blockquote   pXY.doc.Z.xyz p blockquote  pThe aspects of that file name that I need are the Y and Z. I know that many people use grep but I am not sure how to use it in this instance. I have already read the grep page and am familiar with the basics of grep but dont really know where to start. p  pEventually I will also need to grep some information from an excel file, if someone cares to advise me in that matter as well. If it helps, this is how I am accepting the files p  precodeF.nlttkchoose.filesdefault, captionSelect a file, multiTRUE, filtersNULL, index1 codepre  pDoes anyone have any suggestions p

Negative 85786 pThis came up as a side effect to an a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma12212803572743an answera on another question today. Its more about curiosity than about an actual problem.p  pJava SE 7 offers what Oracle calls the forkjoin framework. It is a presumably superior way to schedule work to multiple processors. While I understand how its supposed to work, I fail to understand the bit where it is superior and the claims made about work stealing.p  pMaybe someone else has more insight on why this approach would be desirable other than because it has a fancy name.p  pThe underlying primitives of forkjoin are codeForkJoinTaskcodes, which are codeFuturecodes, and the idea is to strongeitherstrong perform work immediately [sic] the wording is misleading as immediately implies that it happens synchronously in the main thread, in reality this happens inside a codeFuturecode below a certain threshold strongorstrong divide work into two tasks recursively until the threshold is reached.p  pA future is a concept of encapsulating a task that runs asynchronously into an object in an opaque and unspecified way. You have a function that lets you verify whether a result is available, and you get a function that lets you wait for, and retrieve a result.br Strictly speaking, you do not even know whether a future runs asynchronously, it emcouldem execute inside codegetcode. The implementation could in theory as well spawn a thread for every future or use a thread pool.br In practice, Java implements futures as tasks on a task queue, with a thread pool attached the same is true for the entire forkjoin framework.p  pThe forkjoin documentation gives this concrete usage examplep  precodeprotected void compute      if mLength lt sThreshold          computeDirectly         return           int split  mLength  2      invokeAllnew ForkBlurmSource, mStart, split, mDestination,               new ForkBlurmSource, mStart  split, mLength  split,                            mDestination  codepre  pThis submits tasks to the underlying threadpools task queue in a manner indentical to how Mergesort would traverse them thanks to recursion.br Say for example that we have an array of 32 items to process and have a threshold of 4, and split evenly, it would produce 8 tasks with 4 items each, and look like thisp  precode00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31                                                . 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 14 1516 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31                        .                       .                       . 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 0708 09 10 11 12 13 14 1516 17 18 19 20 21 22 2324 25 26 27 28 29 30 31            .           .           .           .           .           .           . 00 01 02 0304 05 06 0708 09 10 1112 13 14 1516 17 18 1920 21 22 2324 25 26 2728 29 30 31       1          2          3          4          5          6          7          8       codepre  pOn a singlecore processor, this will submitexecute in a very complicated way task groups 12345678 in order.br On a dualcore processor, this will submitexecute 1,32,45,76,8  sup[1]sup.br On a quadcore processor, this will submitexecute 1,3,5,72,4,6,8.p  pIn comparison, a emnaiveem implementation without all the superior magic would just submit the tasks 12345678 to the task queue right away.

This involves constructing, referencing, and destroying Nlog2N objects for N subtasks that factually do nothing. Why is this superiorpli lipNo locality of reference is preserved. Neither processor caches nor virtual memory like being treated like that. Why is this superiorpli lipExcept on a uniprocessor system, tasks are guaranteed not to be scheduled in an order that is anywhere close to their original order. This may be no issue if it really does not matter, but it makes things like e.g. a fence or barrier pretty much unfeasible. The only way of having something like a fence is waiting for the root object to complete and only submit new tasks after that. This is equivalent to a complete pipeline stall which is exactly what you dont ever want to happen.pli lipThe Oracle documentation claims that this approach implements work stealing emand is therefore better than a thread poolem. I dont see this happening. All I can see is a very complicated way of submitting tasks to a plain normal thread pool. How is this supposed to magically implement work stealingpli ol  hr  psup[1]sup Lets not make it too complicated and assume that worker threads dont outrun each other, tasks all take the same time to process. Otherwise, execution might of course happen in a different order, though submission would be the same.p

Negative 85786 pAt work we are developing multiple systems that are highly modular and should not have hard dependencies on each other. Now we need these systems to share a common mechanism for authentication and security  or in other words  SSO Single SignOn.

The point is to have it properly integrated with our other systems. p  pThe two approaches I can think of arep  p1 Expose a RESTful services from the SSO that allow the authentication and authorization operations to be performed by the the other two systems.p  p2 Expose a common API for authentication and authorization that will wrap our SSO functionality and have the two systems reference the API and use it directly.p  pAt the moment we are not considering using any thirdparty solutions in this area, and we have already done some work on the would be SSO module, so we would prefer to stick to a simple solution that would best utilize the existing efforts.p  pWhich approach should we choose and why What are the significant benefits of each one over the other Is there a better alternativep

Negative 85786 pIm working with PHP and MySQL.p  pBefore we startbr  strongIm aware of SQLInjection Please do not suggest alternatives, I already know.strongp  pIm not too hot with SQL queries, I am currently having a PHP loop through an array of field values obtained from a codePOSTcode form. These values are then checked against values already in the database, if they are different and not NULL, the columns will be updated. All of this is done in PHP. I was wondering if there was a way to loop with pure SQL query Here is the general idea of my codep  precodeforeachmyInfo as keygtvalue     ifvalue[mand]         frmErr  POST[value[post]]    1  frmErr          frmErrStr .

Im also able to identify different commands by just simply split a String, e.g. commandmsg. But I think that may be a little inconvenient. So Im wondering if there are better ways to realize that. And I stumbled over that side  a hrefhttpwww.javaworld.comjw011997jw01chat.htmlpage6 relnofollowhttpwww.javaworld.comjw011997jw01chat.htmlpage6a At the very end it saysp  blockquote   pAn alternative, however, and much more elegant solution, is to abstract the protocol behind a set of stream classes. The specifics of header construction and insertion can be handled automatically by the stream classes, and the client is then left with much the same interface as before Clients write messages to a stream, but instead of flushing the stream, they call a method that attaches appropriate headers and sends the encapsulated message.p blockquote  pI dont really know what is meant by that. Could somebody explain it, or even better, give me a code example. Perhaps there may are other ways to dop

Negative 85786 pI have a web server that has strongmanystrong compressed archive files zip files available for download. I would like to drastically reduce the disk footprint those archives take on the server.p  pThe key insight is that those archives are in fact emslightly different versions of the same uncompressed contentem. If you uncompressed any two of these many archives and ran a diff on the results, I expect you would find that the diff is about 1 of the total archive size.p  pThose archives are actually JAR files, but the compression details are  I believe  irrelevant. But this explains, that serving those archives in a specific compressed format is nonnegotiable  it is the basic purpose of the server.p  pIn itself, it is not a problem for me to install strongdifferential storagestrong for the content of those archives, drastically reducing the disk footprint of the emsetem of archives. There are numerous ways of doing this, using a hrefhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiDeltaencoding relnofollowdelta encodinga or a compressed filesystem that understands sharing e.g. I believe a hrefhttpsbtrfs.wiki.kernel.orgindex.phpMainPage relnofollowbtrfsa understands block sharing, or I could use snapshotting to enforce it.p  pThe question is, stronghow do I produce compressed zips from those filesstrong  The server I have has very little computational power, certainly not enough to emrecreate JARs on the flyem from the blocksharing content. p  pIs there a programmatic way to expose the shared content at the uncompressed level to the  compressed level  An easilytranslatabletozip incremental compressed format  p  pShould I look for a caching solution coupled with generating JARs on the fly  This would at least alleviate the computational pain from generating the JARs that are the most requested.p  pThere is a hrefhttpwww.edn.comdesigncommunicationsnetworking4326852Plugginghardwarebasedcompressionintoaserver relnofollowspecialized hardwarea that can produce zips very fast, but Id rather avoid the expense. Its also not a very scalable solution as the number of requests to the server grows.p

Negative 85786 pSay I have a database called awesome which is located on a live server and at the same time duplicated on a staging server for testing. My web app is based on Play 2.1.1 using Scala.br So I have these datasources defined in my emapplication.confem filep  precodedb.awesometest.driver com.mysql.jdbc.Driver db.awesometest.urljdbcmysql127.0.1.1awesome db.awesometest.usermrawesometester db.awesometest.passwordjusttesting  db.awesomelive.driver com.mysql.jdbc.Driver db.awesomelive.urljdbcmysql127.0.0.1awesome db.awesomelive.usermrawesome db.awesomelive.passwordomgthisisawesome codepre  pDepending on what environment I am on, I would like to use either codeDB.withConnectionawesometestcode or codeDB.withConnectionawesomelivecode. I am controlling this via another value in my config so I e.g. put codeenvironmentawesomelivecode in there and then get the respective connection string via codePlay.configurationcode.p  pNow, the problem is that apparently play attempts to create a DB connection to each datasource defined in the config right away. A This fails depending on which environment I am on. E.g. on the staging machine I will get something like this pic is only a mockup of course because the live DB is not reachablep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.combuWMC.png altp  p...although it is completely unnecessary to try to connect to that DB, because it will never be used in this environment. B Even if the connection would work, of course it would not be feasable to create two connections live and testing when only one of the two is ever needed.p  pIs there a way to tell Play to deferpostpone creation of the DB connection until it is actually needed e.g. when codeDB.getConnection...code or codeDB.withConnection...code or something is called for that datasource I am thinking something like codedb.awesomelive.deferCreationtruecode.p  pCheers, Alexp

Negative 85786 pI have following problem in my model file I would like to CPLEX solver first performs actions in brackets and then was multiplied. As is usual mathematics .... But when I run my model file with this constraintp  precodesubject to c4a e in E, k in K, o in O f[k,o]  0 gt          delta[e,k,o]  p[k,e]  suml in Kb[l,e]1f[l,o]  0  else       delta[e,k,o]  0 codepre  pwhere E,K,O are sets delta, f are binary variables and rest is parameter. I have problem which I describe before with this brackets 1f[l,o]. When I try resolve example data file I receive following bugp  precodeCPLEX 11.2.0 logical constraint slogcon[1] is not an indicator constraint. expand slogcon[1] subject to c4a[12,2,o1]f[2,o1]  0 gt delta[12,2,o1]  3  f[2,o1]  f[3,o1]   f[4,o1]  0 else delta[12,2,o1]  0 codepre  pHere you see that CPLEX solver on the first multiply elements from brackets by b[l,e] and then it try to adds them. My question is how to avoid this situationp

Negative 85786 pI know the ISO C standard make a big deal about separating translation behaviour and execution behaviour, partly to ensure crosscompilers dont have to carry the execution environment of every target.p  pBy that, I mean the compiler has limited information available to it compared to a running program. That limits what you can do in the source code, such as not initialising a variable based on the return value from a function like thisp  precodeint twice int val  return val  2  int xyzzy  twice 7 int main   printf dn, xyzzy return 0  codepre  pWhat Im curious about is how user defined literals in C11 fit into this scheme. Since the literal evaluation relies on a function, whats to stop that function doing things likep  ul lireturning a random value even if based on the input such as code42roughlycode giving you a value between 40 and 44li lihaving side effects, such as changing global variablesli ul  pDoes the fact that a function have to be called means that these emarentem really literals in the sense of being calculated at compile timep  pIf thats the case, whats the advantage of these literals over any other function call.

Negative 85786 pI just set up a new PhoneGap project for android, which worked perfectly fine without any problems, there were almost no changes to the template project.p  pThen I wanted to move that exact project to iOS, and the woes began.p  pWhen I start the project, suddenly a bunch of alter dialogs pop up, with device information, network status. Each offer me ok and cancel.

Obviously, codedevicereadycode is never fired on this.p  pSince this project is merely the template offered by Cordova themselves, I find it hard to believe it is not supposed to run.

Negative 85786 pIm trying to escape  a semicolon  in a string on unix shell bash with sed. It works when I do it directly without assigning the value to a variable. That is,p  precode echo hello  sed s[]1g hello  codepre  pHowever, it doesnt appear to work when the above command is assigned to a variablep  precode resultecho hello  sed s[]1g    echo result hello   codepre  pAny idea whyp  pI tried by using the value enclosed with and without quotes but that didnt help. Any clue greatly appreciated.p  pbtw, I first thought the semicolon at the end of the string was somehow acting as a terminator and hence the shell didnt continue executing the codesedcode if that made any sense. However, that doesnt appear to be an issue. I tried by using the semicolon not at the end of the string somewhere in between. I still see the same result as before. That is, p  precode echo hello  sed s[]1g hello   resultecho hello  sed s[]1g   echo result hello  codepre
Negative 85786 pI have a self hosted WCF service that listens on port 80 the thirdparty device does not support sending on other ports.  I also have two web sites and three Web API base services that are also on port 80 and have been working well.  All of these servicessites run using different FQDNs testsvc1.example.com, testsvc2.example.com, testsite1.example.com, etc...  It is important to note that all the subdomains point to the same IP Address on the server.  All of this has been working great until I try and install my service that hosts my WCF service.  Once I install that service when I attempt to navigate to either of my two sites I get a page with the following information on itp  p.....p  pYou have created a service.p  pTo test this service, you will need to create a client and use it to call the service. You can do this using the svcutil.exe tool from the command line with the following syntaxp  p.....p  pIf I stop my WCF based service then my site works fine.p  pThe following is the code that is used to host the WCF service.     public class MyService              private const string MyServiceName  MyService         private ServiceHost selfHostp  precode    public void Start              this.selfHost  new ServiceHosttypeofMyWebService, new Uriwcf.exampe.com          try                      BasicHttpBinding binding  new BasicHttpBinding             int tempValue  0             this.selfHost.AddServiceEndpointtypeofIMyServiceContract, binding, MyServiceName              ServiceMetadataBehavior smb  new ServiceMetadataBehavior             smb.HttpGetEnabled  true             this.selfHost.Description.Behaviors.Addsmb              this.selfHost.Open                   catch  CommunicationException ce                       this.selfHost.Abort                    public void Stop               Close the ServiceHostBase to shutdown the service.         this.selfHost.Close        codepre  pThis code is called by a windows service wrapper.

Negative 85786 pI want to choose which directive to use based on a variable. Specifically, I have items of several different types in a list, so I would like to use the item type to choose the directive that can display it. p  pngswitch seems intended for this purpose. However, it adds all of the switch choices into the DOM, then hides all but one. That approach seems inefficient if there are many item types or a long list to display. Also, using a switch puts the logic in the HTML. Preferred would be a strategy pattern that would just choose the right directive, perhaps likep  precodeltdisplayitem.type dataitem.data gt codepre  pwhere the directives are displayType1, displayType2, and so on. However, this syntax seems not to work, perhaps because of the difference between the compile and linking phases. a hrefhttpscoderwall.compmgtrkg relnofollowHerea is an example that switches html templates inside a directive.

Negative 85786 pI am in the process of developing a forwarder application for VLC and have run into the following problemp  pThe forwarder is supposed to receive a UDP stream and forward it to another middleware, which will then put the packets on a time triggered network. My issue lies with the irregularity of the packets sent by VLC. The target network processes the messages in a periodic manner, causing it to drop frames, once VLC starts sending many packets in quick succession usually during scene changes for example. I need to enforce a sporadic behaviour for these bursts of data, so they may arrive as they please, but get forwarded with a minimum interrival time.p  pSo far, my forwarder works as followsp  pI put the whole thing in a QThread and connect the emreadyReadem signal to my emreceivePacketem slot which handles reception, processing and sending the data again by calling a second function emsendPacketemp  pMy first naive idea was to simply have the thread strongsleepstrong for, say, 100 microseconds after each emQUdpSocketwriteDatagramem call, but this seems like a bad approach, since I will be suspending the whole thread and thus I am not sure about this lose packets from VLC which arrive during that time.p  pAnother solution I thought of was creating a singleshot strongQtimerstrong, which would delay the emwriteDatagramem call. But here, I am not sure what will happen if another packet arrives and triggers the emreceivePacketem slot again and thus overwriting the message I am trying to delay sending.p  pIs there an easy way to solve this problem The only way I could imagine possible would be to introduce an internal buffer to the sender, but this sounds like a lot of work and since I am on a deadline, I would like to avoid that.p  pThank you in advancep

Negative 85786 pIm using sequelize.js as ORM, and Im trying to define the relationship between two objects Review and User. One User can writehave many reviews.

Negative 85786 pSo Im taking an algorithms class, and for my final project Im decided to take some of the Cuda stuff I learned at work and put together some GPGPU sorting algorithms an evaluate their growth over different objects. But then Ive gone and confused myself over how many threads actually are running at the same time...Please let me know if I am understanding this incorectly.p  pSo I have a GeForce GT 650M. Cuda Capable 3.0 card.p  pIt has 2 multiprocessors, so each processor takes 1 block at once. That part I get...but beyond that is where it starts to get fuzzy for me.p  pThe largest number of threads running concurrent is 384 2 MPU192 CoresMPU, or 2 MPUs6 WarpsMPUp  pEach MPU has a set of 192 Cuda Cores, which means that each processor can do up to 192 operations at once yes no regardless of the maintained thread count. So the parellization factor lt384, correctp  pEach block is running nlt1024 threads at once, which the warp scheduler will choose which ones are taking up the 192 cores. A warp of 32 threads, I believe, but I could be wrong is the group of concurrency that is set.p  pWhen a kernel is called, the GPU distributes the blocks equally. If you have a odd number of blocks, there will be a period of time where you have 192 threads. p  pHowever, if a single thread in a warp finishes early, then it must wait until all other threads in the warp finish before it skips on to the next warp.p  pA block of warps will finish before moving to the next block. Up to 16 blocks are allowed to run at the same time on a MPU. why on earth would this happen, btw. However, all blocks must finish before calling the next kernel.p  pIs this rightp

Negative 85786 pIm developing a DB layer, using JDBC ojdbc6.jar which allows to perform basic DB operations by getting and returning a Map containing NameValue pairs. For examplep  precodemap.putStrField, str map.putIntField, 10 map.putBoolField, true DB.inserttableName, map ... map  DB.querySELECT  from MYTABLE..  assuming this returns only one row Boolean flag  map.getBoolField  etc... codepre  pThe insert operation is easy to implement because conversion from Java primitive types to Oracle types is easy and intuitive. p  pFor the opposite direction OracleJava the correction is slightly more tricky. I managed to convert all types except Boolean. Since there is no BOOLEAN data type in Oracle DB, Im looking for a way to define a field so that my retrieval layer will clearly identify such a field as Boolean.p  pThe best way I found so far is to use something like thisp  precodeBOOLFIELD CHAR1 DEFAULT 0 NOT NULL CHECK BOOLFIELD in 0, 1 codepre  pPlus, I make sure that I dont use CHAR1 anywhere in my DB, except when Boolean is needed. This is not a big limitation because CHAR1 is not very useful for anything else anyway.p  pAnd in my Java conversion code, I check if a particular returned field is codejava.sql.Types.CHARcode via codeResultSetMetaData.getColumnTypecode call, and I also check that the size of the field is 1, in which case I can safely call codeResultSet.getBooleancode and get field value as Java Boolean data type.p  pSo far, it works really well, but now I have a problem with external databases, i.e. databases, in which I cant control the tablecolumn definition. For such databases, Im OK not to have Boolean values at all, but I wonder how I can distinguish my Boolean from just a regular CHAR1 that someone else is using in the external database.p  pI could ignore this entirely, and in case of CHAR1 get Boolean values truefalse, but this wasnt my intention. For example, if a particular CHAR1 column has a value of X impossible for my database, but valid case in external database, then my conversion code will return codetruecode instead of X.p  pIm looking for some metadata or trick which I can add to my BOOLEAN DB field, so my JDBC layer could get this metadata and if it gets it  assume its MY Boolean and not someone elses CHAR1 which looks similar.p  pAny ideas on such a trick even if not 100 safe, but reasonably safep  pThanks.p  pstrongEditstrong Just as an example, using RAW1 in Oracle would do the trick perfectly, because there is closetozero chance anyone, anywhere will be using RAW1 for anything else. The problem with RAW1 is that its really hard to use in SQL queries, i.e. its hard to do WHERE with such boolean definition.p

Negative 85786 pI am experimenting with OpenDolphin after a while of being interested in its concept, I am at the defining requirements phase with some friends for a project we want to make with hopes of earning some money from it this projects concept will be based on a servermultipleclient model where we want the server to have most of the logic, we have average to little experience couple of years each doing java projects but not anything big or exactly with the latests tools, so we struggled a little bit understanding the building process of the gradle setup, and after running this project, we are now faced with tons of groovy projects demos.p  pAnd I am struggling to keep my friends interested in the library as they think using what we know best is a better option than trying to understand a library that would mean to learn asap a new language we are not that lazy but there is some people that is helping us as consultantsassociates and we are afraid that if we dont start producing something we are gonna lose their support [we are not earning anything from this yet but without them as productowners, we wouldnt know what are exactly the market needs].p  pI have watched multiple videos and videos like this a hrefhttpwww.youtube.comwatchvz54hEJvpZys relnofollowhttpwww.youtube.comwatchvz54hEJvpZysa are amazing , I think that is exactly what we need.p  pI would like to know if maybe there is an exampletutorial in java maybe a screencast,blog or recorded webinar of how to make a simple application where the server binds to a port and multiple java clients update the value and sends a pair of commands.p  pI dont know something like server starts, puts a default value in a variable, client connects and sees value, second client connects sees value, and a command is sent to server erase, and both clients see that the server erased it and another command is sent default and server sets variable to default.p  pI am not asking for that exact example but something that I can read to make it like that.p  pI tried making something like that using the .8 release and I was utterly lost, but i think that an easy example like that could help me to make them see how good of a tool this is,  Install this in your laptop, thats the server run it and see how my client and yours are synched automagically. p

This suggests to me that the 3D position lock was determined with four or more satellites although Im reluctant to believe that the exact altitude is 0.

Negative 85786 pI am trying to do a local installation of a large but simple installation PostgreSQL 9.3.2 to hold about 14 GB of data, currently in a CSV file. This is my first attempt to install any database other than SQLite.  The installer is asking me questions that I do not know how to answer and that seem inappropriate for an installation that I do not want to make available to the internet. I expect to be interacting with it through the R package RPostgreSQL. The database will contain primarily US Census data that is publicly available for free, and so not a tempting target. For instance, the installer asks me what port to use, and seems to require that I set a password.

Example table is this with values stored.p  precodetable1  id   name    anotherid  1    name1   1 2    name2   1 2    name2   2 codepre  pI have textboxes that I can change how many they appear. For example I have two textboxes. The value on textbox one is name1 and the second is name2p  pMy query must find those two values in table1 and, when theyre found, their anotherid column must be the same also.p  pFrom the first table, All I want to get is thisp  precodetable1  id   name    anotherid  1    name1   1 2    name2   1 codepre  pHowever when a situation like this appears and I still have two textboxes with the same valuesp  precodetable1  id   name    anotherid  1    name1   1 2    name2   1 2    name2   2 3    name3   1 codepre  pThe result must be empty.p  pNow back to the first table. I used this code.p  precodeSELECT  FROM table1 WHERE name  name1 and name  name2 and SELECT  FROM table1 WHERE name  name1 and name  name2 group by anotherid codepre  pbut all I get are empty results.p  pHow do you do thisp
Negative 85786 pHi there I hope you can help.p  pWe are currently investigating the use of WSO2 API Manager and we have spun up the AMI image on a EC2 instance. The product works fine for carbon and store on the default port on 9443, however our security guys would rather us try and move it on to more standard ports that they have already have configured.p  pI have found a previous article a hrefhttpsstackoverflow.comquestions13822462wso2apimanagerdeployinec2andchangedefaultportsWSO2 Api Manager  Deploy in EC2 and change default portsa and followed the instructions but it fails.p  pI have tried modifying the API MANAGER HOMEam160wso2am1.6.0repositoryconftomcatcatalinaserver.xml and changed the port from 9443 to either 8443 or 443 this would be perfect if it is possible. p  pIf I set the port to 8443, restart the instance and issue a netstat a I do see the port 8443 listening but I am unable to connect. If I set the port to 443 then I see nothing listening.p  pIf I set the port back to 9443 it still fails. I have to replace the catalinaserver.xml with a copy of the untouched version.

Negative 85786 pI have to maintain an application whos database is a little haywire and I had the following challenge to join 3 tablesp  ptable1 timestamp,zid,aaap  ptable2 timestamp,zid,bbbp  ptable3 id,some,other,datap  pSo table 1 and 2 need to be joined and sorted on their timestamp columns.

Negative 85786 pI have read a great many posts about WF and am very impressed by what it claims to do.  Ive been reading documentation and white papers and am also intimidated by the learning curve.  I have a rather different requirement than most developers who have been asking the Will WF work for me question though.  Most of the posts focus on human speed tasks get an email, put together an order, send information to warehouse and billing and wait for their responses and so forth down the workflow persisting information when waiting for choices and taking the event from a person to continue the processing.p  pHowever, in my case humans are observers only.  We have a lot of developers running VERY long running tasks on number crunching computers somewhere between 36 and 48 hour long number crunches.  The human interaction would be setting up the parameters for an execution, hitting a button to queue it up if the crunching machines are busy and then observing the resources used by the process and wait for it to complete.  Users arent going to keep their application open for days, so persisting the information when they close or requesting it when they open the client is important.p  pI like the idea of WF taking care of the persisting information and being able to take care of the queue though when we move to a priority queue, Im sure Ill have to write the priority metric, but I dont know how it would work with holding onto a System.Diagnostic.Process object to track a running process on a remote machine.  And if it did, could I get the state information of the process memory, CPU demand, time running when neededp

Negative 85786 pI maintain a PowerBuilder Classic 12.5 application which has functionality to print checks on a Source Technologies MICR printer.

Negative 85786 pIve been testing GUI possibilities using QtQuick and QML, but Ive been having trouble finding information on applying GLSL shader effects to the Window itself. For example, lets say I want to make a fullscreen application that simply blurs everything behind the window as you move the application window around your desktop, everything behind the window would be affected by the shaders, and if you maximize the app the entire screen would be affected.p  pIn the official QtQuick5.2 documentation, they mention applying a a hrefhttpqtproject.orgdocqt5qmlqtquickshadereffect.html relnofollowshader effecta to an Image element. In order to do so, they make a variant and connect it to the Image using the id. Ive tried referring to the id property of my Window QML element, but it doesnt work results in a black window as the shader fails to process correctly. There is also the a hrefhttpqtproject.orgdocqt5qtgraphicaleffectsindex.html relnofollowQtGraphicalEffectsa module, which has some very nice effects built into it, but I havent had much luck with applying those effects to the window either.p  pSo, with QtQuick2.2 and QML, is there anyway to capture the pixels behind the window and process them using a GLSL shader andor QML Graphical Effects propertyp
Negative 85786 pI have been battling with trying to draw a bitmap and then highlighting a region on it with a rectangle. Originally, I was drawing a bitmap with alpha black in paint to make image darker and then on top drawing original bitmap in a region creating effect of highlight. I discovered that largest slowdown was because of alpha in codePaintcode.

It works. But I am not happy with response time. After profiling Bitmap is what takes the longest. I have scaled the bitmap to the size of the screen already so its drawing 300x800ish image. The biggest resource hog seems to be the Lighting effect. Because when I turn it off I get decent response time.p  pSo I was wondering if I have missed anything to improve how quickly bitmap is drawn, maybe caching Or am I just stuck with this because I want darker image and actually should rethink the highlightingselection altogether Why is is so expensive to draw a bitmap with alpha colour in 2D imagep

Negative 85786 pOkay, p  pSo Ive built a JS that communicates to the server php. p  pa User enters the website, it adds a 24 hour cookie and a session cookie both of which have a random number generated key. If they have already been on the site, such as a session cookie or the 24 hour, the same key will be used. p  pEvery 15 seconds they are on the page, it Pings a new Image url, that sends the key to the server. the server then logs that key with their IP address, that way the combos could be endless and multiple users on the same IP can be entered.p  pI monitor their mouse movements. and if they do not move the mouse on the page for more than 60 seconds, they are now idle and I no longer send the Ping, the database removes users that have been idleinactive for 3 minutes or have not sent a ping. gives some buffer and forgiveness time. anyways all that seems to work great.p  pBut I started logging the Time they entered and the last time they sent a ping to the server. The numbers are outstanding. There is a HUGE amount of users on the site too long to be real. If they dont move the mouse, they are idle, however, 2,000 users online, 150 of them have been on the site longer than 20 minutes and moving the mouse or atleast fouling javascript that they are moving the mouse, and its messing up the avg duration time.p  pI am lost for words. Im trying to build a very accurate online counter with avg duration, but how could someone be on the site that long, whats causing them to continue to send a ping to the server. Makes no sense. Ive looked at user agents, its all different browsers, and they dont seem to be Bots that are known, such as googlebot. They are rogue.p  pThese users will remain actively sending a ping to the server every 15 seconds for days, I have limited to 120 ping max if they do not click a page thats 30 minutes, but the pings continue, its crazy. p  precodevar onses  decodeURIComponentsrreadSE3 var oncook  decodeURIComponentsrreadON3 if onses        var key  Math.floorMath.random  99999999  1.toString     var bk  key  else      var bk  onses  srpinge1 var idleTime  0 var pingcap  0 var idleInterval  setIntervalsridletime, 1000 function addEvent evnt, elem, func      if elem.addEventListener          elem.addEventListenerevnt, func, false          else if elem.attachEvent          elem.attachEventon  evnt, func          else          elem[evnt]  func       addEventmousemove, document, srmovements function srmovements       idleTime  0  function sridletime       idleTime  idleTime  1     if idleTime gt 60          if this.ping              clearIntervalthis.ping             this.ping  false                   else          if this.ping  else              srping                function srping       this.ping  setIntervalfunction           srpinge0     , 15000  function srpinge pv      pingcap  pingcap  1     if pingcap gt 120 return false     returned  0     if pv  1          if oncook                var ontime  new Date, onexpire  ontime.setTimeontime.getTime  86400000             srsetON3, encodeURIComponentbk, ontime             srsetSE3, encodeURIComponentbk                  else              if onses                    returned  1                 srsetSE3, encodeURIComponentbk                                var im  new Image     var img  httpDomainotypeonampvVersionamppvpvamprreturnedampkencodeURIComponentbk        img   amp a  accountid amp dn  endocdomain amp dt    new Date.getTime     im.src  img  codepre  pIm not sure where to post this, but I want to be sure the code Ive built would work well within many browsers, my guess could be something isnt functioning somewhere, and people are active when they shouldnt be.

Negative 85786 pI am working on an app where I need to reorder rows of section 1. I could achieve the reorder by implementing the tableView delegates. When the table is in editing mode I show reorder for section 1 and no controls for rest sections, but the rows of rest section should be deleted by swipe to left.p  pI am not sure whether this is possible but my requirement is exact the same.p  pWork done by me Below are the delegates of tableView I implementedp  precode UITableViewCellEditingStyletableViewUITableView tableView editingStyleForRowAtIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath       if [self.myTable isEditing]              return UITableViewCellAccessoryNone          return UITableViewCellEditingStyleDelete   BOOLtableViewUITableView tableView canMoveRowAtIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath      if indexPath.section  1          return YES          return NO   BOOLtableViewUITableView tableView canEditRowAtIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath      return YES  codepre  pThe above code made the edit mode look as I wanted. Reorder sign got visible for only section 1 amp red delete button is also not visible for rest sections as desired.p  pProblem The rows of sections apart from section 1 were also not being deleted.When I swipe to left nothing happens.p  pIn short in edit mode, section 1 should be reorder enabled and rest sections should work as they work in normal mode i.e swipe left to delete row should be functioning in tableview edit mode.p  pAny pointers are appreciated. Thanks in advance p

Negative 85786 pThe answer to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5328007whydoesntoptionhaveafoldmethodthisa question suggests that the fold method on Option in Scala is a catamoprhism. From the wikipedia a a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiCatamorphismcatamophisma is the unique homomorphism from an initial algebra into some other algebra. The concept has been applied to functional programming as folds. So that seems fair, but leads me to an a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiInitialalgebrainitial algebraa as the initial object in the category of a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiFalgebraFalgebrasa. p  pSo if the fold on Option is really a catamophism there needs to be some functor F, to create the category of Falgebras where Option would be the initial object. I cant figure out what this functor would be. p  pFor Lists of type codeAcode the functor codeFcode is codeF[X]  1  A  Xcode. This makes sense because List is a recursive data type, so if codeXcode is codeList[A]code then the above reads that a list of type codeAcode is either the empty list code1code, or codecode a pair codecode of an codeAcode and a codeList[A]code. But Option isnt recursive. codeOption[A]code would just be code1  Acode Nothing or an codeAcode. So I dont see where the functor is. p  pJust to be clear I realize that Option is already a functor, in that it takes codeAcode to codeOption[A]code, but what is done for lists is different, the codeAcode is fixed and the functor is used to describe how to recursively construct the data type.p  pOn a related note, if it is not a catamorphism it probably shouldnt be called a fold, as that leads to some a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8539935whatstherelationoffoldonoptioneitheretcandfoldontraversableconfusiona. p

Negative 85786 pIm looking into using codeUIDocumentcode en codeNSFileWrappercode to store projects that contain quite a few large video files and some small text files. There are a few problems that I run into, and Im starting to wonder if UIDocument is still the right strategy.p  pstrongPerformancestrongp  pAs far as I can tell, NSFileWrapper loads everything in memory. This can be a problem when working with large video files. I think its possible to work around this by using custom save and load methods that forego the standard codeNSFileWrappercode.p  pstrongMetadatastrongp  pI want to display a list of all the documents along with some metadata. This can for example include a preview image, number of recorded scenes, length of videos etc. The only way to fetch this data now is to open each document and retrieve it. Probably quite slow, especially with large documents.p  pstrongSolutionsstrongp  pI see two solutions now ditch UIDocument altogether and go for a custom architecture, or use some kind of centralized metadata file. Drawbacks of the latter is that I have to manage metadata in two separate places and that I need to keep them in sync manually.p  pIs UIDocument still the way to go here, and if so What could be a way to solve these problemsp

Negative 85786 pWhat are the guidelines to follow such that data can be previewed nicely on CKAN Data Preview tool I am working on CKAN and have been uploading data or linking it to external websites. Some could be previewed nicely, some not. I have been researching online about machinereadability and could not find any resources pertaining to CKAN that states the correct way to structure data such that it can be previewed nicely on CKAN. I hope to gather responses from all of you on the dos and donts so that it will come in useful to CKAN publishers and developers in future. p  pFor example, data has to be in a tabular format with labelled rows and columns. Data has to be stored on the first tab of the spreadsheet as the other tabs cannot be previewed. Spreadsheet cannot contain formulas or macros. Data has to be stored in the correct file format refer to another topic of mine a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions24298200whichfileformatscanbepreviewedonckandatapreviewtoolWhich file formats can be previewed on CKAN Data Preview toolap  pThanksp

Negative 85786 pIm currently building a modal directive that I can use to populate with some data tables.  I have an attribute on the directive called modalvisible that will be a boolean value, defaulting at false.  If the default is true, on load, the modal is visible.  However, when I initially set it to false and change the value from an event, the attribute changes, but the directive does not pick the change up.  I have a watch in the link portion of the directive, but that only picks up the initial change.  p  pBelow is my code examples.  I just have a simple test page with a button and the modal.  The modal attribute modalvisible is set to false.  When the button is clicked, the modals modalvisible attribute is updated to true, but the modal does not show on the page.

Negative 85786 pIve been developing a few basic Android apps recently and notice a slightly odd behaviour which Im sure is my own wrong doing.p  pThe problem seems to lie with the main thread which Im using for both updating the UI and some processing such as sending a message via Bluetooth. p  pLets say I have the followingp  precodepublic void sendMessage   updateUI   sendBtMessage   public void updateUI   txtView.setTextSending message   progressbar.setVisibilityView.VISIBLE   public void sendBTmessage ... connect to BT and send message here  codepre  pAs I run my code it appears to be running sendBtMessage first as the UI update appears after the message is sentI would like it before sending the message. Is this because the main threads priority is to do the heaviest workload first p  pShould the main thread be used for only updating the UI p  pAny Suggestions or advice would be appreciated.p

Negative 85786 pI have created an application that allows the user to upload a photo from their computer onto the server, and then using facebook api to post onto facebook. At the moment it allows the user to tag friends who are also using the application. They are then required to set their privacy preferences via a few forms in html. This then sends a notification to the friend that is tagged, and they are directed to a page to set their privacy preferences.p  pWhat I want is to compare these two privacy preferences before making the facebook api request. Initially I thought this would work in my conflict.php to compare the variables in privacy.php and my friendprivacy.php using POST. However, I have just realised this does not work due to the different user tokens. I am very confused. Do I need to have a database for this If so, can someone kindly give me some help with how it would work with my app.p  pAnd is there a way to do this without a database p  pI am getting the privacy preferences from users via a simple form in HTML. So they choose either ALLFRIENDS or CUSTOM if they choose custom they would then get directed to a page to choose the friends they want to share with.p  pI just want to see if the chosen preference matches between the users and if they do, I will set this as value and call the facebook request to post the photo as shown below.p  precodeprivacy  array      value gt ALLFRIENDS,          photo  new FacebookRequest session, PHOTO, mephotos, array      source gt new CURLFile location.name,     message gt caption,     privacy gt jsonencode privacy     gtexecutegtgetGraphObjectgtasArray codepre  pThis is the first version of my app, so any mismatch, the app simply does not post the photo.p
Negative 85786 pI need to create 2 buttons arranged like this in my android applicationp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comv6PyX.png altenter image description hereimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comxpgFg.png altenter image description herep  pBut the problem is that the button I have created is not a perfect traingle shaped button. In fact it is a square button with the image set as background. Here in this case there is a problem such that the white areas near the image is clickable and I want the buttons to be more close.Which means that the white space in between the two button has to be eliminated to maximum. When I use relative layout, the problem is that, when I click on 1 button, sometimes the other button also gets clicked automatically. This is because one button is overlapped to the other button. So without overlapping the buttons, I want these two buttons to be so close that they will look like a parallelogram actually.So my question is how do I change the shape of rectangle buttons to a triangular shaped button so that the two buttons can be arranged in such a way that it look like a parallelogram. Any help from anyone is easily appreciated I didnt know from where to start with. So a little help with the coding part would be easily appreciated..Thanks in advance..p

This BC takes care of collecting all orders placed by our customers from our different websites, validates them and populates its corresponding database by Orders with state either codePlacedcode or codeRejectedcode.p  pThe 2nd BC is codeShipmentcode. This allows the employees in the warehouses to mark an Order as codeShippedcode in its database once it leaves the warehouse.p  pNow since both BCs use different databases which are empty at first, there will be a need to inform the codeShipmentcode BC of the orders that were codePlacedcode, so that when a scanner wants to codeShipcode an codeOrdercode it will be there in the codeShipmentcode BC.p  pMy initial approach was to create a domain event once an codeOrdercode is placed in the codeOrder placementcode BC and have the codeShipmentcode BC subscribe to that event and create a corresponding codeOrdercode entity in its database for every order placed.p  pHowever, I cant stop that feeling that Im duplicating data across different databases. p  pMy second approach is to ask the codeOrder Placementcode each time an order is being codeShippedcode for an codeOrdercode entity, but I still need to maintain the state of the Order in case a failure of a failure in the shipment.p  pIs there a better approach to all this from a DDD POVp

Negative 85786 pstrongUpdatestrong Still getting this problem in the launched  GM version of iOS 8.p  pMy Cordova app version 3.5.00.2.7, in iOS 7, requests push permissions from the user when I try to register the device.p  pNow, in iOS 8 beta 5, with Xcode beta 7, it requests push permissions the moment the app is opened for the first time. This is not good, since users will often deny permission if the request isnt given some context.p  pFrom what I can tell, iOS 8 now lumps remote push notifications and local notifications together into the same permission request, whereas previously, local notifications werent separately requested.

Negative 85786 pI have many years experience using WPFC to develop client and server apps. Im currently thinking about the best choice of technologies for a rich client app that is capable of fairly dynamic, animating data visualizations preferably with efficiency measures such as UI virtualization so I can be efficient with memory.p  pWPF and XAML is great for this sort of work sadly, in wishing to have a data visualization client run on Android and iOS, as well as Windows, I would rather not have to go through developing clients for each particular platform and so Im seeking a very good, crossplatform client library with these sorts of capabilities.p  pThere seems to be two main options for this, both with disadvantagesp  ul liBuild a web client. HTML5 I lack experience with, but it seems to lack the richness of WPF and doesnt seem to yet be fully supported. Because of this, it isnt yet a defacto universal client markup standard. Bog standard HTML 4 and CSS is extremely difficult to produce rich animating UIs with. Happy to be challenged on this opinion if those with experience of HTML5JS have comments.li liUse a crossplatform UI library such as Xamarin.Forms  which supports XAMLWPF. The main advantage is I could use the amazing C.NET framework with a crosscompatible client  but Im not sure in choosing this technology that I will be missing out on developments in HTML5, and dont know if the platform has issues or complications.li ul  pMacromedia Flash seems to be dying a slow death. Does anyone have any advice, who has created a rich client app that works on Android, Mac and Windows Was trying to go for a crossplatform solution more trouble than it was worth and is it preferable then to spend time developing the same client views natively on each platformp  pThanksp

Negative 85786 pI really have no idea if what Im thinking is feasible, but what the heck.p  pI have some MP3s of game music. This game music was rendered from a Tracker format, which means that at some point the track loops back to an earlier point, so its like thisp  precodeIntroMain loopMain loopMain loop fade codepre  pOr in regex formp  precodepIntropMain0pMain1pMain2pMain0pMain1fading codepre  pI hope this communicates whats going onp  pBasically, I want to know if I can detect the start and end of the main loop based on repetition of the waveform. The idea being that since they are rendered from a tracker format, the waveform should be exactly the same between loops, even after having been baked in MP3 format.p  pIf this is possible, how might I go about finding such a repeating loop The goal is to programmatically extend these looping tracks to repeat more times, so I dont have to do it manually.p  pAt this stage Im simply looking for general algorithms to approach the problem. I can work out how to read an MP3 files waveform, process it and save a new one without difficulty, what I need help with here is stronghow to find a repeating portionstrong of the waveform. Does anyone have any wisdom to impartp

Negative 85786 pI came from OpenGL but it was a little bit to low level for me so now I wanted to work with plain SDL2 for a small tile based game. I wanted to ask how I can draw pixel independent like in OpenGL What I mean is, that in OpenGL there was always the coordinate system left 1, right 1, top 1, bottom 1, and I could draw things with floats completely pixel independent. But now in SDL2 I can only render in pixel units. I dont like that, so I search a way, how I can get the usual OpenGL feeling.p  pThanks for readingp
Negative 85786 pHow can I place an overlay over my page, while selecting specific elements to be placed ontop of the overlayp  pFor example, place a dark overlay over your entire page and let a button be on top of it.

Negative 85786 h2What Im trying to doh2  pSend data to node, have node save it in mongoDB, and when its done  send a response saying that it worked. Then grab that data with angulars codehttp.getcode from mongoDB via node.p  h2The problemh2  pThis is all running perfectly on my local machine, but not on my server. On my server, I get a response saying the data was successfully saved, and I can even check the database directly in the command line with the mongo cli and I see the data there. But it takes several page refreshes, or about 30 seconds before the most recent post actually shows up.p  pIf I have multiple posts from the past, and I make a new post, Node queries mongoDB and returns all the posts from about 30 seconds ago and prior, so only the most recently saved data doesnt show up. Again, this is not the case on my local machine, where I get all of the data immediately.p  pSo, Im just wondering if anyone has experienced this or knows why it might be happening Why would the mongo CLI show me the most recent data instantly, while making a request to a node route via angular http returns old results for about 3060 seconds after the data is saved Is it possible that either node or mongo are cacheing results and taking a while to update the cachep  h2My setuph2  h3Local Machineh3  ul liOSX  10.10li liNode  v0.10.33li liMongoDB  2.6.4li ul  h3Serverh3  ul liCentOS  release 6.5 Finalli liNode  v0.10.33li liMongoDB  2.6.4li ul  h3node.js saving the data in mongoDBh3  precodevar order     size safePostData.size,   toppings safePostData.toppings,   etc...  db.pizza.update   authToken ltuser authentication goes heregt ,    addToSet      orders order    , functionerr, updated    if err  posted      res.sendstatus false, stackTrace placing order, msg order failed    else      res.sendstatus true, stackTrace placing order, msg order was placed     codepre  h3angular.js getting the data from the serverh3  precodeangular.modulefakePizzaExample   .factoryuserData, userData  userData.inject  [http] function userDatahttp    var homeData      var refreshData  functioncallback      http.getltURL TO ROUTE ON NODE SERVERgt       .successfunction data, status, headers, config          homeData  data          if typeof callback  undefined            callbackdata                       .errorfunction data, status, headers, config          console.logdata              refreshData    return      get function         return homeData     ,     refresh functioncallback        return refreshDatacallback          codepre  h3node.js sending the data back to angularh3  precodedb.users.findOne   authToken ltuser authentication goes heregt , functionerr, found    if err  found      res.send  status false, stackTrace find user, msg No user found      else      userData  found     res.send status true, stackTrace find user, msg userData      codepre  hr  h2Updateh2  pI had a friend of mine log on to the server to see if he had the same delayed result, he didnt.

My current work item is to design an authentication and authorization solution for the product. I have decided to leverage external identity providers, such as Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Twitter, and the like for authentication.p  pIm trying to solve the problem of, when a request comes to my server, how do I know who the user is and how can I be sure. More questions below as well...p  h2strongRequirementsstrongh2  ol liRely on external identities to indicate who Im dealing with userId essentially is all I care about.li lipThe system should use token based authentication as opposed to cookies for example or basic auth.p  pI believe this is the right choice for scaling across multiple clients and servers while providing loose coupling.pli ol  h2strongWorkflowstrongh2  pBased on my reading and understanding of token based authentication, the following is how I imagine the workflow to be.

However, the recommended approach for subsequent verifications after the first is unknown to me. If there are typical patterns, Im interested in hearing about them. I understand they may be application dependent based on my requirements however, I just dont know what to look for yet. Ill put in the due diligence once I have a basic idea.p  pFor instance, possible thoughtsp  ul lipHash the access token  userId pair after first verification is complete and store it in a distributed cache accessible by all web servers with expiry equal to access tokens. Upon subsequent requests from the clients, hash the access token  userId pair and check its existence in the cache. If present, then request is authorized. Otherwise, reach out to Facebook graph API to confirm the access token. Im assuming this strategy might be feasible if Im using HTTPS which I will be. However, how does performance comparepli lipThe accepted answer in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions12065492restapiforwebsitewhichusesfacebookforauthenticationthis StackOverflow questiona recommends creating a custom access token after the first verification of the Facebook user token is complete. The custom token would then be sent to the client for subsequent requests. Im wondering if this is more complex than the above solution, however. This would require implementing my own Identity Provider something I want to avoid because I want to use external identity providers in the first place. Is there any merit to this suggestionpli ulli lipIs the signedRequest field present on the response in step 3 above mentioned a hrefhttpsdevelopers.facebook.comdocsfacebookloginloginflowforwebv2.2checkloginherea, equivalent to the signed request parameter a hrefhttpsdevelopers.facebook.comdocsfacebookloginusingloginwithgamescheckloginherea in the games canvas login flowp  pThey seem to be hinted as equivalent since the former links to the latter in the documentation. However, Im surprised the verification strategy mentioned on the games page isnt mentioned in the manually building a login flow a hrefhttpsdevelopers.facebook.comdocsfacebookloginmanuallybuildaloginflowconfirmpagea of the web documentation.pli lipIf the answer to 3 is Yes, can the same identity confirmation strategy of decoding the signature and comparing to what is expected be used on the serversidep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com2qLdU.png altDecode amp compare from FB docs p  pIm wondering if this can be leveraged instead of making an outbound call to the debugtoken graph API step 6 above to confirm the access token as recommended a hrefhttpsdevelopers.facebook.comdocsfacebookloginmanuallybuildaloginflowv2.2checktokenhereap  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comE7cGW.png altdebugtoken graph API from FB docsp  pOf course, in order to make the comparison on the serverside, the signed request portion would need to be sent along with the request to the server step 5 above.

Negative 85786 pI have implemented Q learning on a grid of size n x n with a single reward of 100 in the middle. The agent learns for 1000 epochs to reach the goal by the following agency He chooses with probability 0.8 the move with the highest stateactionvalue and chooses a random move by 0.2. After a move the stateaction value is updated by the Q learning rule.p  pNow I did the following experiment All fields next to the goal got a reward of 100 except the neighbour at the bottom. After learning for 1000 epochs the agent clearly avoids going the top way and arrives at the goal from the bottom most frequently.p  pAfter learning set the reward of the bottom neighbour to 100 and the top neighbour back to 0 and start learning again for 1000 epochs while sticking with the state action value map. Its actually horrible The agent needs very long to find the goal on a 9x9 grid up to 3 minutes. After checking the paths Ive seen that the agent spends a lot of time bouncing between two states like 0,01,00,01,0...p  pIt is hard for me to imagine if this behaviour makes any sense. Has someone experience with a situation like thisp

Negative 85786 pIve got a chart thats automatically generated inside of a spreadsheet, and it is programmatically deleted each time an update is done, with a new chart put in its place. The problem is, should the data that its referencing be deleted first, I get the error The coordinates or dimensions of the range are invalid.p  pThis error points to the first line of the deleting charts functionp  precodevar charts  convertSheet.getCharts   for var i in charts      convertSheet.removeChartcharts[i]    codepre  pSo apparently, if a chart has an error, Google Apps Script is unable to even access it, even if its only to remove it. Im not seeing a viable solution to this problem up until now. I even tried inserting new data in the range that the chart points to before attempting to delete it, so itd have good data, but no dice. And unfortunately, it stops the entire script, how do I deal with thisp
Negative 85786 pAlright so Ive two codeViewControllercode. One is the root and the other one is a filterView that applies some filters on root view controller. FilterView has a codeTableViewcode on it with multiple selection options. When I tap the codeUIButtoncode on root view, it shows the filter view which has the table and I select multiple options form it and when I dismiss the filterView it successfully dismiss it and by using a delegate method it successfully made changes to the codeRootViewControllercode.  br See the image below to have a more clear picture. The button on left Three Horizontal Bars will show the filter view controller and similarly the down button shows root view again. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comkkHcq.png altImage defines the two views I have br My question is that when I again taps on the button it load the whole table all over again. With no selected value. I want it to hold the checked values so that user can uncheck them and check new filter values. br br  When user taps the filter button here is the code which Im usingp  precode IBActionfilterButtonidsender      FilterViewController arvc  [self.storyboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifierFilterView]     [self presentViewControllerarvc animatedYES completionnil]  codepre  pAnd for back button on FilterView Im using thisp  precode[self dismissViewControllerAnimatedYES completionnil] codepre  pSo what should i write in back button so that it should keep the multiple checked rows and show if the user view it again.

Negative 85786 pstrongTLDR How do I grab the serial data from the embedded device, convert it to Json and send it off as an http request to my webservicestrongp  pIm making a project where my plan is to take sensor input from an embedded device, and then pass that info by serialusb connection through either a laptop or a Raspberry Pi and convert it to Json and send it to a webservice in asp.net c, where it gets stored in a database, and then the data can be shown on a website, so the visitor can see live data from embedded devices sensor on the site and also be able to see what the sensor measured yesterday, last month, or the average for a extended period of time, or a graph.p  pIt might be easier to illustrate what Im talking aboutp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comsemh5.jpg altenter image description herep  pThe Win7 PC  Raspbian OS part is optional, it can be using either one.p  pstrongIts the blue arrows on the image that this question is about.strong And its only the connection between the first 3 boxes on the image, rest is just to give an idea of how the setup is thought out to be. p  pThere are a few options, as I see it, as to which methods could work. But I am unsure about how to implement them and what programs to use for it.p  pFirst one is to log data to a file on the PCRPI and then have some shell script either listen for changes and then combine a Json string with the newly added info to the file and send it of to the webservice.p  pSecond one is to somehow take the Serial data from the embedded device and have some shell script or program listen for any data coming from the embedded device and converting it to Json, and sending it of to the webservice. The pros by this method would be omitting the extra filestep, but it would make the system more vulnerable to any interruptions in the connection.p  pIm using an Arduino as the embedded device, but since it goes through the usb, it could be any embedded device. I have a temperature sensor connected to my Arduino, and its the readings of my temperature sensor I want to update live on a website.p  pWhich of my two ideas are best Or is there a better setup Does anyone have experience with doing something like this Or maybe have an idea how I can do what Im trying to do  Or just a nudge in the right direction, as to which approach you think is best, or what programs I couldshould use. Any help is very much appreciatedp  pBest regards Danielp

Which could mean that my codecatidcode is not working well and therefore the correct category is not in the query. Id like it that when I click on a category I get all the posts from that category. I have a close button, that will remove posts from gallery div, and toggle the width change when you click on the image, the gallery will fill 40 of the width.p  pAlso is it possible to make it so that when I have a gallery open, when I click on the image, while my gallery is open, to change the posts in the galleryp

My theory is that it is automatically sorting the keys by length in the case of a tie, and not alphabetically. How can I change thatp

Negative 85786 pPrefix For those who see this and think TLDR, actual question is at the endp  pSince discovering lambdas and delegates in C, Ive become a big consumer of them. However, I have an ongoing concern when it comes to releasing memory on objects that are maintained in a closure, especially when dealing with nested closures. For example, consider the below from a set of classes Im writing for what Id consider to be appropriate codeINotifyPropertyChangedcode behaviour.p  precodepublic static PropertyChangedEventHandler GetHandlerltTDependant, TDependantHost, TFoundation, TFoundationHostgt              this TDependantHost target,         PropertyChangedEventHandler invokeTarget,         ExpressionltFuncltTDependantHost, TDependantgtgt dependantRef,         ExpressionltFuncltTFoundationHost, TFoundationgtgt foundationRef,         ExpressionltFuncltTDependantHost, TFoundationHostgtgt foundationHostRef          where TDependantHost  ISupportsDependencyManager     where TFoundationHost  class, INotifyPropertyChanged      string foundationName  GetPropertyInfofoundationRef.Name     string dependantName  GetPropertyInfodependantRef.Name     string foundationHostName  GetPropertyInfofoundationHostRef.Name     FuncltTDependantHost, TFoundationHostgt foundationHostRefCompiled  foundationHostRef.Compile     PropertyChangedEventHandler oOut  null       Complex situation. This is more complex because whilst TDependantHost bears a relationship to TFoundationHost      the actual dependency is on a property in TFoundationHost.      oOut is the property changed handler that will be attached to target, so it needs to       Raise changed events whenever foundationHostRef would evaluate to a different object       Whenever that change occurs, attach a new PropertyChangedEventHandler to the new foundationHost       ... which also handles removal of itself from target so as to guarantee     oOut  s, e gt              var sender  s as INotifyPropertyChanged         if sender  null             return         if e.PropertyName  foundationHostName                       The Foundation Host has changed. So we need to attach a new inner PropertyChangedEventHandler to it.             PropertyChangedEventHandler innerHandler  null             innerHandler                  s2, e2 gt                                       Caller safety...                     var innerSender  s2 as TFoundationHost                     if innerSender  null                         return                       Check and see if this eventhandler still points to the right object                      If it does, well keep going  otherwise, got to remove the event handler and return                     if foundationHostRefCompiledtarget  innerSender                                              innerSender.PropertyChanged  innerHandler                         return                                            Now we know that the inner handler is executing for an entity that still bears the correct                       relationship to target. So we just check the same way as usual  did foundation just change                      If so, so did dependant                     if e2.PropertyName  foundationName                         invokeTarget.SafeInvoketarget, dependantName                                since the foundation has shifted, the dependency will also have changed              Raise a handler for it.             invokeTarget.SafeInvokesender, dependantName                   return oOut  codepre  pWhat this is supposed to do and it might  still need to test though, and I think I need a couple of null checks here and there isp  ul liWhen a reference type property on target changes, raise a codePropertyChangedcode event for the dependant property identified by codedependantRefcodeli liIn addition, attach a codePropertyChangedcode handler to codefoundationHostcode, so that if foundation changes, target gets notifiedli liEnsure target doesnt get notified for codefoundationHostcodes that are no longer related to it by resolving codefoundationHostRefcode before execution of the event handler, and detaching if that happens.li ul  pSo using the above logic, and leaving aside the question of codefoundationHostcodes that are nested more than one layer deep this is a work in progress, it looks like any object that has EVER been referred to by codefoundationHostRefcode will maintain a closure reference to target even when it is no longer related to it, at least until it tries to raise an event.p  pNow my understanding of this is that the event handler Ive created could easily stop the memory occupied by target from ever being released. All that would need to happen would be for some object to occupy codefoundationHostRefcode at some point, then get reassigned elsewhere, and have a longer lifetime than codetargetcode Depending on what codetargetcode is doing that could be anywhere from annoying codetargetcode is a singleton that doesnt take up much memory to catastrophic codetargetcode gets created and nulled thousands of time over program lifetime, and has some property that occupies a lot of memory, and GC never collects it.p  pstrongSo, my questionstrong What built in protection is there, if any, against this kind of thing And if there isnt, how should I tweak my delegateslambdas so that they stop being evilp

Negative 85786 pWe have an existing application that feeds to several downstream systems via webmethods. The data is fed by wemethods to the downstream systems using the following process 1. The source system exposes stored procedures that webmethods periodically executes to retrieve specific rows. 2. The stored procedure result in 1 is transmitted to downstream systems via another stored procedure call on each downstream system.p  pThere is an initiative to remodel the database of the existing application and rewrite the GUI to introduce new features and make the data model more generic. The plan is to limit the effect of changing the source applications data model to webmethods messaging layer so that no change is required on any of the downstream systems. This means the followingp  ol liThe source system will be exposing a new set of stored procs for webmethods to execute to retrieve data new data modelli liAn adapter will be introduced in webmethods that will convert the new data model result of calling stored proc from 1 to the old data model prior to calling the original downstream interface stored procedure.li liNo changes required to any downstream system.li ol  pGiven the planned changes above and in order to fully test the interface between the remodeled application and the downstream systems, we are planning to do the followingp  ol lilog all downstream system stored procedure calls including the input parameters on both the old system and remodeled systemli liCompare all the logs from both old and remodeled system to ensure the downstream interface has not been affectedli liExecute 1 and 2 for large number of datatest cases via automation.li liPerform manual validation on downstream systems smaller set of test datali ol  pDue to the remodel and huge amount of data and test cases, it would be impoaaible to perform 4 above for each and every scenario. Thus the need for 13, as these will serve as guarantee that the interface behaves the same way and passes the same data even after remodeling.p  pAny comments or suggestion on the design and test approachp

Negative 85786 pstrongEditstrong There seems to have been some understandable confusion by me using the terms 1st and 2nd implementation referring to them in the order they were listed, after I had mentioned that the 2nd one listed was the first I tried implementing, so I reworded the relevant paragraphs. Sorry for the confusion.p  pSome motivational background I am building a constraint solver in SWI Prolog, and to greatly optimize space and time, Ive built a reverse index into the main constraint data structures. Whenever a variable in my system not a Prolog variable is assigned a value, I want to make sure this assignment does not make any other constraints unsatisfiable. I have an index from variables to constraints to quickly select the constraints to check. As some point, this boils down to applying a trycheck2 predicate to a given lefthandside LHS and to all the elements of a righthandside list RHSL whose indexes appear in a list IdxL. Heres my current implementationp  precode FORALL Implementation trycheckfilteredLHS, IdxL, RHSL      forallmemberIdx, IdxL, nth0Idx, RHSL, RHS,             trycheckLHS, RHS. codepre  pI also have an earlier implementation which does the same thing, but takes an additional argument at the 2nd position to keep track of the current list index the list of indexes is sorted in ascending orderp  precode TailRecursive Implementation trycheckfilteredLHS, Idx, IdxL, RHSL trycheckfilteredLHS, Idx, [], RHSL  .     Stop when index list is empty trycheckfilteredLHS, Idx, [IdxTi], [HT]  ,  If at next index gt check     trycheckLHS, H,     Inext is Idx1,     trycheckfilteredLHS, Inext, Ti, T. trycheckfilteredLHS, Idx, IdxL, [HT]         If not at next index gt skip     Inext is Idx1,     trycheckfilteredLHS, Inext, IdxL, T. trycheckfilteredLHS, Idx, IdxL, [].            Done when at the end of RHSL codepre  pI have two questionsp  ol liIs there a better way to implement this that I cant think ofli liI was surprised to find that the forall implementation performs better than the tailrecursive one. In my mind, the tailrecursive has a linear time dispatch walks down the list once to call all the necessary trycheck, whereas the forall implementation has quadratic dispatch linear number of calls to member, each causing another linear call to nth0. If youre curious about the performance improvement I saw, in an execution that takes 44s, using the forall implementation over the tailrecursive on saves about 4s.li ol  pOne thought I had was that the tailrecursion optimization was not applied to my tailrecursive implementation, forcing multiple copies of the lists onto stack frames, thus making it slower. In order to hopefully enable the tailrecursion optimization for my tailrecursive implementation, I tried to make my trycheck2 predicate deterministic by adding a cut  right at the end of the rule. Is that enough Does it matter that the trycheck2 rule has temporary side effects it asserts some facts, which it retracts before finishing, thus leaving the collection of facts unchanged. The performance I reported above was with the cut in the trycheck2 predicate.p  pI hope I gave sufficient information to have a constructive discussion. Thank you in advance for the repliesp  pstrongEditstrong Heres the high level implementation of trycheck. The entire code is 2600 lines, many of which probably half are indirectly used by this check, so it is not possible to post here.p  precode trycheckeniE1effect, E2effect trycheckeniE1, E2      pushtrying,     checknotry,      isnoninterferingE1, E2     gt cleartry, poptrying      cleartry, poptrying, fail     , . codepre  pcodepushtrying0code and codepoptrying0code assert and retract a codetrying0code predicate which slightly modifies how some of the other predicates operate, so that I wouldnt have to duplicate the code used by checking predicates for the trycheck predicates. codeisnoninterfering2code is nondeterministic. In codetryingcode mode, codeisnoninterferingcode marks instantiated variables as codetry1code so that the instantiation can be retracted by codecleartry0code after the constraint is checked. p

Negative 85786 pId like to add some business logic to my spring applications authorization process and I think that implement a custom AccessDecisionVoter is the best solution.p  pThat would be great, but I havent found any way to add this new voter to the authorization process without completely redefine the AccessDecisionManager bean. This is very inconvenient because my business logic should be added transparently and does not require any specific decision manager. Instead, it should only tells his opinion vote and let the enclosing application apply its own authorization policy.p  pEven the spring securitys suggested example a hrefhttpsspring.ioblog20090103springsecuritycustomizationpart2adjustingsecuredsessioninrealtime relnofollowhttpsspring.ioblog20090103springsecuritycustomizationpart2adjustingsecuredsessioninrealtimea uses this approach.p  pI have found also a promissing solution at a hrefhttpforum.spring.ioforumspringprojectssecurity109476howtoaddvoterstothedefaultaccessdecisionmanagerp570570post570570 relnofollowhttpforum.spring.ioforumspringprojectssecurity109476howtoaddvoterstothedefaultaccessdecisionmanagerp570570post570570a, that might add additional voters to any AbstractAccessDecisionManager using a bean post processor, but the method setDecisionVoters key to such solution is deprecated and thus its out of question.p  pSo, I was wondering if there is some way to add my voter to the current AccessDecisionManager without having to take care of it.

Negative 85786 pWe use Kendo Grid for heads down data entry in an accounting application. We need the grid to behave similar to QuickBooks.

Negative 85786 pI am currently trying to understand arrows and FRP, and I came upon a question, which I cannot seem to map to FRP, namely how to model a road network.p  pI thought I could model a road network as Arrows, where each Arrow represents a road segment. It accepts streams of cars at locations and times and produces the same type, albeit with different locations and times.p  pSo far so good. But this model does not take into account, that segments may get jammed. While each segment could well respond to heavy traffic and delay cars more and more, the more congested it gets, there would be no backwater effect, i.e. the jam would not propagate backwards to other road segments.p  pI suspect I am applying too much OO thinking here, instead of focusing on what needs to be computed, but I cannot get it right in my head.p  ul liHow can I model a road network with Arrows such that backwater effects are taken into accountli ul

Negative 85786 pIm working in a situation where were moving from having a bunch of transactional fact tables to a more complicated picture with aggregates, snapshots, etc. In the past, there were a few cases where data needed to be aggregated by month, but previous developers had just put the key for the first day of the month it belonged to into a column in the fact table, and pointed it to the usual date dimension. This seems to work OK, we have daymonthyear hierarchies in the cubes for each date dimension, and users are doing fine when they need to look at things by month.p  pWhen I read around  mostly Kimballs work, but other guides as well  the suggestion is that we should be using a shrunken dimension in these cases. a hrefhttpwww.kimballgroup.com201108designtip137creatingandmanagingshrunkendimensions relnofollowThe Kimball Group even specifically mention it in regards to a Month dimensiona. But Im really not finding a whole lot of information about implementing them past that article, and brief writeups that seem to be rephrasing parts of it.p  hr  pstrongOne of my particular concernsstrong is that at the moment, people using our cubes are used to having one date dimension for each different type of date with yearmonthday hierarchies, and they just only go down to month level when thats what they need. If this is going to result in a separate dimension with a yearmonth hierarchy, then it seems like it might be unwelcome clutter. But is this the intentionp  pThe last two paragraphs in the linked article are the only thing Ive found tackling how this should work in the presentation layer, and I just dont get what theyre trying to describe. It feels short a couple of examples to flesh out how this should appear in a cube. Normally, Id just trialanderror this, but timescales are very tight. So...p  ul liIf I do this, what is the intended display in the cube Would I have two separate date dimensions, with one that only goes down to monthli liIf the above is correct, is there really much point in this, seeing as people can currently happily query things at a monthly level without it I feel like Im missing what the benefits really are. I can see its more semantically correct were at month level, so holding first day of the month is hacky and will show unrelated attributes, but with users who are already used to this, Im not convinced thats enough reason to spend more time on this just now. I can see it could perform better given itd be a smaller dimension, but were not having performance issues asis. Am I missing somethingli liIf I do go ahead with the changes, any tips on getting the shrunken dimension working in the cube Normally I can dig around online until I narrow something down to the best couple of options, but theres really not much around, and Id appreciate hearing from someone whos done this before. Not looking for anything huge, but something either written a little more technically than that article or a miniexample would probably leave me feeling a lot clearer about what needs doing and why. The Kimball article especially confused me when discussing needing to join the base dimension to the shrunken dimension in order to see attributes.li ul  pFirst two points are the big ones, because Id know whether I need to make any data warehouse changes, and get them done if so  I would be very glad for an answer on those, even if you cant cover the third point.p

When I searched I found that this is because TKinter is single threaded, and the main gui thread may get stuck with some tasks, but even after Ive used some simple threading the window still freezes. p  pHere is a sample code of what Im doing, p  precode   import threading   from Tkinter import  from PyQt4 import  from tkFileDialog import askopenfilename import numpy as np import xlrd  global columnList  def openfile filename     fileNameinput Enter file name example.dat     colCount input Enter number of columns in the file      try         workbook  xlrd.openworkbookfilename         sheetworkbook.sheetbyindex0         columns  []         for i in range 0,sheet.ncols1            columns.appendnp.array sheet.colvaluesi,1  make a list, each index has a numpy array that represnts a column.            if i0                columns[i] columns[i].astypenp.float         Preprocessing depth         m columns [0]         for i in range m.shape[0]             m[i] m[i]2 1          mm.astypenp.int         columns[0]m          print sheet.rowvalues0,sheet.ncols           removing nans         indexinputenter the column index to interpolate          m columns [index]         for i in range m.shape[0]1, 1, 1             if np.isnanm[i]                 mnp.deletem,i                 columns[0]np.deletecolumns[0],i                 columns [index] np.deletecolumns[index],i      except IOError         print The specified file was not found      return columns [0], columns [index]   class Interface     def initself, master         frame Frame master         frame.grid stickyY          self.title Labelmaster,textKriging Missing data Imputation, fgblue, fontHelvetica, 18         self.selectfile Label master, textSelect the file that contains the data must be an excel file , fontHelvetica, 12           self.title.grid row1, column5, columnspan 4, pady 20,0         self.selectfile.grid row3, column1, stickyW, pady20,0, padx5,2         self.browsebutton Button master, textBrowse, commandself.browser, fontHelvetica, 12, width12         self.browsebutton.grid row3, column3, pady20,0          self.varColumn StringVarmaster         self.varColumn.setdepth         self.columnLabel Labelmaster,textSelect a column to process, fontHelvetica, 12          self.columnList OptionMenu master, self.varColumn,nan, ,           self.columnLabel.grid row5, column1, pady20,0, stickyW, padx5,0         self.columnList.gridrow5, column 3, pady 20,0           self.missinglabel Labelmaster, textSelect missing data indicator , fontHelvetica, 12         self.var  StringVar master         self.var.setnan         self.menu OptionMenu master, self.var,nan, ,           self.missinglabel.grid row7, column1, padx5,2, pady 20,0, stickyW         self.menu.gridrow7, column3, pady 20,0          self.extrapolate Label master, textSelect a range for extrapolation max800 , fontHelvetica, 12         self.maxextra Entry master          self.extrapolate.grid row9, column1, padx5,2, pady 20,0,  stickyW         self.maxextra.grid row9, column3, pady20,0          self.alabel Label master, textenter the value of a range , fontHelvetica, 12         self.avalue Entry master          self.alabel.grid row11, column1, padx5,2, pady20,0,  stickyW         self.avalue.grid row11, column3,  pady20,0           self.startbutton Button master, textStart, fontHelvetica, 12, width12         self.pausebutton Button master, text Pause, fontHelvetica, 12,width12         self.stopbutton Button master, textstop, fontHelvetica, 12,width12          self.startbutton.grid row13, column1, pady30,0          self.pausebutton.grid row13, column2, pady30,0         self.stopbutton.grid row13, column3, pady30,0        def browser self         filename  askopenfilename         x,v threading.Thread targetopenfilefilename         openfilefilename          we must then send the file name to the function that  reads it somehow.  window Tk  main window. starter Interface window   window.mainloop keep the window open until the user decides to close it. codepre  pIve read that Tkinter is not thread safe, and I maybe using some threading in some other functions, so how can I solve the problem of freezing with using threading Or, shall I use another GUI builder like PyQt4 p  pAny help is appreciated. p  pThanks. p

Negative 85786 pI am developing an app IOS platform using HTML5, CSS3, angular and cordova3.8 and stuck with an major issue.p  pI have a page with footer having three buttons. On click of each button a modal comes up from the bottom. Modal position is set to fixed and inside it as scrollable container. scrollable container contains a text area where user can input some text. Whenever the modal comes up, text area is focused so that keyboard comes up by default. The issue is whenever native keyboard comes up webview is pushed up and entire modal gets scrolled.  I saw same issues been posted by others and I tried few solutions mentioned in reply for those questions like using ionic keyboard plugin, setting scrollTop to  0 on textarea focus. But nothing worked out. In config.xml, I have set DisallowOverscroll to true.p  pIt would be great helpful if someone help me with this issue p

Negative 85786 pIm trying to create a contact form on my own. I noticed that it can be achieved by placing the form inside an article, instead of a custom html module.p  pIn the client side, it seems to work. I even added a captcha manually the recaptcha plugin doesnt seem to work for me. The problem is, I set forms action property as mail.php, and just added this mail.php file to the the template root. The mail.php supossedly retrieves the data send by post, and finally composes and sends the email, showing a message send notification.p  pAnyway, when I click on submit, the form page is just reloaded. I guess that Joomla cant find my mail.php. I guess that this issue is related to the joomla structure and my inability to place the mail.php.

One returns codeLinuxallportscode and one returns codeLinuxcode from codeSystem.getPropertyos.namecode.p  pWhat does codeLinuxallportscode mean  And why would one system return one, and one system return the other  Is there an internal state in JAVA that could change this property or somethingp  pbNOTEb The specific hardware emmay notem be identical motherboard, chipset, PCI cards, etc. but we dont expect this to change the os.name right  If hardware would affect os.name property, that would be great to know for sure.p  pBoth machines PXE boot from the same OS image Ubuntu, and we confirmed that JAVA verbuild is identical, output of codeunamecode is identical, so we are quite confident the environment is identical.  p
Negative 85786 pI want to build SPA web app with Angular.js, however it will use Codeigniter MVC on the server side.p  pI am confused because to follow the Codeigniter MVC rules all views should be under applicationviews folder and those should be accessible by calling an controller method which will return view. I read about angular angular.js structure and I think the solution a hrefhttpsscotch.iotutorialsangularjsbestpracticesdirectorystructure relnofollowdescribed herea is very good. However, following this structure all views excluding index should be in public htmlappmodulename folder. p  pI am wondering where html views should go To public HTML or to applicationviews folder and what is the difference, how it could affect my further appp  pI hope that I described my problem well enough.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 85786 pI use scientific linux Fedora with an AFS. I try to run a binary file from Php without results. I saw the log error and I have denied permission. I changed everything to 777, but nothing is changed. I think that the problem is that the apache folder is under my directory inside the AFS directory, and Im the owner of the files here. I tried to change the owner of the files with is apache user, but is not possible also as sudo. I looked for a user named apache accordingly to my httpd.conf, but I didnt find it inside AFS. I want that apache could execute the files inside the Afs. Thanks for help.p

Negative 85786 pIm an intern at a small company who is making some fixes to a 15 year old access database that is used to keep track of customers, jobs, etc. Im trying to write an update query and cant seem to get to work the way I need it to. Here is my sitation.p  pI have two tables. One contains Company information. The other contains Contact information. The primary key of the company table is also in the contact table, for a onetomany relationship. E.g., if a company has 3 contacts, the CompanyID number that is from the primary key of the Company table is associated with the three contacts in the Contacts Table.p  pOk. Now the problem is that there is some legacy code in a form, called Company, that searches simultaneously for both contacts and companies. The problem is that there is a field in the contacts table called ContactCompany that is being used by this old search function. If a user changes the Company name with the form, the Company name is updated on the Company table, but NOT in the Contacts table.p  pI decided that an update query would be the way to go, to sync up the Company Name information on both forms. I tried to design it so that if the ID numbers matched between the tables, the company name in the Company table would get copied over to the contacts table. My code is belowp  precodeUPDATE Company INNER JOIN Contacts ON Company.ID  Contacts.CompanyID AND Company.ContactCompany  Contacts.ContactCompany SET Contacts.ContactCompany  [Company].[ContactCompany] WHERE [Contacts].[CompanyID][Company].[ID] codepre  pWhen I run the query Access tells me that it is updating X number of records, but the records do not update. p  pPlease note that I used query builder the SQL code was autogenerated by access when I go into SQL view.p  pIm not very experienced with VB all of my knowledge has been from googling stuff. If someone could give me some pointers on what Im doing wrong or how to proceed Id be grateful. Thanksp

Negative 85786 pI need some advice about mean.js server side internal API design.p  pIm creating a mean.js module to handle network diagrams. I have a model of a graph and I want to include a reference to the user who created the graph and allow comments for which I have a dedicated comments module.p  pMy code is as followsp  precodevar mongoose  requiremongoose, Schema  mongoose.Schema      Graph Schema   var GraphSchema  new Schema     id  type String, index true ,     title  String,     about String,     dateCreated type Date, default Date.now ,     dateModified type Date ,     createdBy          type Schema.ObjectId,         ref User     ,     licence          type String,         default ,         trim true     ,     comments [type Schema.ObjectId, ref Comment],     date  type Date, default Date.now ,     hidden Boolean   mongoose.modelGraph, GraphSchema codepre  pIm referencing the User and Comments objects via the Mongoose type Schema.ObjectID however it got me thinking that this is creating coupling between the modules. What is the recommended approach to this API design  The user and comment are both being served to my client side as REST resources, would it be possible to make the mongoose model reference the URI for the REST resource. I figure then if I was to do a change like move my user management to an external service I would just have to update the REST URI in the MongoDB record, whereas the way I have it now I would have to update every module that references the user object.p
Negative 85786 pIm refactoring PHP code to move from mysql and mysqli functions to PDO, and would like to accomplish this as efficiently as possible.p  pI use a file I call core.common.php. I initializes the PDO database access object, has SESSION management features, and other features such as generic message and error notification functions in the form of s.  I use the MsgBox and ErrBox functions extensively while developing and debugging.  This file gets included at the top of every PHPgenerated web page.p  pI have managed, at least through emsomeem testing, to successfully pass the PDO object by injecting the PDO object in the construct method to classes that require database access.p  pIt seems to me that this approach, while it still works so far, would only apply to each visitor of the site...  Each visitor can use the same PDO connector throughout all pages they visit on the site.p  pMy real questions are... What happens when there are many visitors   Does each get their own PDO instance   Would this mean that there would be many instances of database connections p  pThe reason Im asking is the host I currently use has limited my resource usage due to...  according to them...  excessive resource usage.  It is a shared server.  They suggest upgrading to a VPS Virtual Private Server, and, of course at additional cost.p  pIs the host scamming me for more   What, in the eyes of the Pros here, would be my best approach to this issue  And...  Absolutely for all...  Be critical and specific.p  pAny ideas are greatly welcomed p

But when I tried reinstalling a lower version of the railties gem4.0.0, the command prompt still asked me to upgrade to the latest version in order to continue. I also installed Passenger web server to check the compatibility and a similar error popped up but this time with the passenger gem. Please look into this accordingly.

Negative 85786 pOur application is caching Entity Framework objects, so that our loadbalanced sites can share cached items, instead of server A and B potentially displaying different content using inmemory cache.p  pHowever, after we have done a deployment, we cannot retrieve the object from cache. The following error is thrownp  pThe deserializer cannot load the type to deserialize because type System.Data.Entity.DynamicProxies.BannerFDE1BA817D206A7F0FED7955D1DAA7B97FEEF3213D26B91515A9AC18E73619EC could not be found in assembly EntityFrameworkDynamicProxiesMyAssembly, Version1.0.0.0, Cultureneutral, PublicKeyTokennull. Check that the type being serialized has the same contract as the type being deserialized and the same assembly is used.p  pFrom what I gather, we have cached the EFproxied version emof the old DLLem to AppFabric, and now retrieving this object is tripping EF over because it does not understand its type in the context of our new DLLs. Weve done a few migrations between these 2 deployments, so effectively the DB model has changed.p  pHow can I work around this I think Ill have to remove the cached objects from AppFabric and readd them in  but then we may hit the same problem the next release that we push out.p
