Positive 5 pIm am trying to use tablesorter to parse json returned for a php POST request.p  pThe Post request returns the json successfully, however, the tablesorter doesnt function correctly.  From what I can tell, only the static table data is taking the tablesorter. The tablesorter is not being applied to the returned JSON data that is being formatted into the table rows.p  pSo basically, what I get is a the filter functionality on the header values that are manually placed in the HTML body.  I believe that this is happening because the returned json is not in the DOM when tablesorter is being applied to the table.

Negative 5 pIve got a number of batch processes that run behind the scenes for a LinuxPHP website. They are starting to grow in number and complexity, so I want to bring a small amount of process to bear on them.p  pMy source tree has a bunch of cpp files and scripts, organized with development but not deployment in mind. After compiling all the executables, I need to put various scripts and binaries on a cluster of machines. Different machines need different executables, scripts, and config files for their batch processes. I also have a few of tools that Ive written that belong on every machine. At the moment, this deployment process is manual and error prone.p  pIm guessing Im just going to end up with a script that runs at the root of the source tree and builds a smaller tree of everything necessary for any of the machines. Then, Ill just rsync that to the appropriate machines. But Im curious how other people are managing this type of problem. Any ideasp

Negative 5 pOne thing I have never truly understood is the concept of character encoding. The way encoding is handled in memory and code often baffles me in that I just copy an example from the internet without truly understanding what it does. I feel its a really important and much overlooked subject that more people should take the time to get right including myself.p  pI am looking for some good, to the point, resources for learning the different types of character encoding and converting between them preferably in C. Both books and online resources are welcome.p  pThanks.p  phr p  h2Edit 1h2  pThanks for the responses so far. I am especially looking for some more info involving how .NET handles encoding. I know this may seem vague but I dont really know what to ask for. I guess I am curious as to how encoding is represented say in a C string class and whether the class itself can manage different encoding types or there are seperate classes for thisp
Negative 5 pI have a model library namespace codeTest.App.Model.EFcode with the Entity Framework implementation in it.  This has all of the entities provided in the EF designer for me which I want to use.  Within this codeModel.EFcode implementation, I have several repository classes.  I want to create interfaces for these classes and place them in a seperate interface library codeTest.App.Model.Interfacecode.  So I do so, obviously the implementation library needs a reference the interfaces.  BUT, I notice that the interfaces need to know about the objects in the EF designer since I want to reuse them.  I cant create a reference from the interface library to the ef implementation because then Ill have a circular reference.p  pSo, as I write this, Im coming to the conclusion that Ill probably need a codeTest.App.Entities.EFcode that has the Entity Framework created entities.  That way my interfaces lib could reference without having to know about the codeModel.EFcode.  p  pDoes that sound like the way to go p
Negative 5 pTotally new to flash and actionscript. What I want to do is retrieve a URL into a page probably in a hidden frame or something, populate the form it contains with the correct fields via my script, including possible data to upload, then submit it back. I guess an analogy usecase would be if I had a user choose a picture and then which site to upload it to tinypic, flickr, etc, the script would download the main page, fill in the form data, attach the pic, and submit it. I saw a similar example in php somewhere, but I need to do it in flash. I can probably get it eventually by myself, but if someone could point me in the right direction keywords, functions to useavoid, etc Id really appreciate itp

Negative 5 pI have to implement some scripting capabilities in our product. The scripting will typically be used for simple things such asp  precodeIF param1 gt 5  param3 AND current time gt 18.00   SET param2 TO 3 ELSE   SET param2 TO 4 codepre  pAnother very common task is to let a parameter vary over the day, preferably using some line diagram with setpoints that can be moved around visually etc.p  pNow, I need inspiration for how to implement this. The very outdated tool our clients use today is little more than a graphical basic dialect you dont have to type the script in plain text but can drag symbols such as IF, THEN, ELSE, Parameter, Current time, etc, onto a canvas, and you have to know and understand the syntax and semantics. I think we could do better.p  pIve been looking around for graphical languages, but Ive yet to find a compelling system.p  pFor example, theres the Lego Mindstorm language, that is very simple but its very directed to automation, and does not handle math and logic very nice. Theres labview, which seems a little too complicated for the typical users. Theres ladderprogramming as used for PLCs, but my experience is that they are also very automationoriented and doesnt handle math very well. Theres the interconnectedboxes approach of Yahoo Pipes and some software synthesizers, but they also get cumbersome to work with when math is needed, and control sequences are not very natural. Then theres very simple, wizardstyle alternatives, such as the filters in Outlook and Evolution, but I dont think they are flexible enough.p  pSo, what graphical languages have you stumbled upon and kindof liked I know hardly no programmers, myself included, enjoy these kind of languages, but they serve a purpose here I think.p

Suppose I have an array of items.br Each item has 3 strings.br These strings are UTF8 strings from many languages.br I want to send these strings to the client via a Web Service in Java.br The client part is Silverlight. In the Silverlight app,br I get the XML, parse it and use LinQ to extract data from it and I use that data in my Silverlight app.br When I try to escape the characters, somehow the parser in the Silverlight throws an exception saying that theres an illegal character in the source string XML string after debugging I found out that actually there IS an illegal character but I dont know how to produce a guaranteed legal XML string.p  pEdit Thank you all for your support. I strongREALLYstrong appreciate it.br I solved my problem.br Turns out somewhere in my code I was producing an illegal character and appending it to my result string.br The question still remains How can I produce a legal XML file even though Im providing it some illegal characters  note that I solved the problem by eliminating the illegal character before producing the XML so I still wonder what if I wanted to somehow send it over but since my problem is solved and theres tons of answers here, I guess the future readers have a head start to begin the journey to face this problem.br I didnt have the time but Im sure these will help.br Theres lots of answers and helps so I cannot select one of them to be my specific answer.br But I have to choose one of them.br I sincerely thank all of the responses.p
Negative 5 pLets say I have a relational database with tables OrderableCategories and Orderables. They are in a relation of onetomany with one OrderableCategory attached to multiple Orderables.     Therefore, an OrderableCategory instance in LINQ has members codeIDcode, codeNamecode and an codeEntitySetltOrderablegt Orderablescode. While sent via WCF wsHttpBinding if it matters anyhow, the EntitySet is translated to simple codeOrderable[]code. An codeOrderablecode Instance also contains a member called codeOrderableCategorycode which is simply an instance of this orderables category. While sent via WCF, I guess something like this happens an codeOrderablecode instance fills its codeOrderableCategorycode instance with fields from this category, but its codeOrderable[]code is also filled with other orderables in this category. These orderables have its codeOrderableCategorycode filled with this category again and so on, so that I could theoretically call for a received orderable o codeo.OrderableCategory.Orderables[0].OrderableCategory.Orderables[0]. ...code and so on. Im only guessing that the server gets into an infinite loop and when message size exceeds the quota, it disconnects and I see an exception of service shutting down. How can I avoid this scenario and have the benefits of relations in my database I think my suspicions are correct, because when I disabled one of the properties made it internal in LINQ Class Designer, the data is filled oneway only and the codeOrderablecode has no longer its codeOrderableCategorycode member, it works. But I would like to know if this could be achieved without compromising the property.p

Negative 5 pApple Threading guide saysp  blockquote   pFor multithreaded applications, Cocoa frameworks use locks and other forms of internal  synchronization to ensure they behave correctly. To prevent these locks from degrading performance in the singlethreaded case, however, Cocoa does not create them until the application spawns its first new thread using the NSThread class. If you spawn threads using only POSIX thread routines, Cocoa  does not receive the notifications it needs to know that your application is now multithreaded. When that happens, operations involving the Cocoa frameworks may destabilize or crash your application.p      pTo let Cocoa know that you intend to use multiple threads, all you have to do is spawn a single thread using the NSThread class and let that thread immediately exit. Your thread entry point need not do anything. Just the act of spawning a thread using NSThread is enough to ensure that the locks needed by the Cocoa frameworks are put in place.p blockquote  pIn my iOS app, Im starting several pthreads from C code right from the start. To be sure the app behaves right, according to the doc above, I create a fake NSThread that does nothing. I dont like creating such useless code usually its WTF, when you first read it and I want to avoid doing so. Is there any better way to put my app into multithreaded modep

Negative 5 pI have developed an Android application that is handling multitouch in a view. I basically track the several MotionEvents that can occur like ACTIONUP, ACTIONMOVE, ...

For every handleTouchStart, the appropriate handleTouchEnded is called. This is crucial for my app. Its a 2D sidescroller with a steering area in the left lower portion of the screen. If  for some reason  the handleTouchEnded method is not called when the user lifts a finger from the touchscreen, the players character continues running.p  pIve received reports from players on other devices like the HTC Desire that in rare occasions, the character does indeed continue running in a direction even if they lifted their finger from the steering area on the screen. I concluded that this can only happen if handleTouchEnded is not called which in turn means that no ACTIONUP or ACTIONPOINTERUP event is generated.p  pAre there device specific implementations of multitouch support Is there no guarantee that for each ACTIONDOWN or ACTIONPOINTERDOWN MotionEvent, an appropriate ACTIONUP or ACTIONPOINTERUP MotionEvent is called Or am I missing something Is my onTouch implementation even correctp  pMy broader question would be are there better ways to handle multitouch touchscreen input for actiongames Im basically mimicking the left and right controls of a gamepads steering cross. Ive found that Androids UI buttons dont offer enough flexibility because they cant track onPress and onRelease events... or do theyp

Negative 5 pI have a postgres database with a table that contains rows I want to look up at pseudorandom intervals.  Some I want to look up once an hour, some once a day, and some once a week.  I would like the lookups to be at pseudorandom intervals inside their time window.  So, the look up I want to do once a day should happen at a different time each time that it runs.p  pI suspect there is an easier way to do this, but heres the rough plan I have Have a settings column for each lookup item.  When the script starts, it randomizes the epoch time for each lookup and sets it in the settings column, identifying the time for the next lookup.  I then run a continuous loop with a wait 1 to see if the epoch time matches any of the requested lookups.  Upon running the lookup, it recalculate when the next lookup should be.p  pMy questions Even in the design phase, this looks like its going to be a duct tape and twine routine.  Whats the right way to do thisp  pIf by chance, my idea is the right way to do this, is my idea of repeating the loop with a wait 1 the right way to go  If I had 2 lookups back to back, theres a chance I could miss one but I can live with that.p  pThanks for your helpp

Negative 5 pOn sites like SO, Im sure its absolutely necessary to store as much aggregated data as possible to avoid performing all those complex queriescalculations on every page load. For instance, storing a running tally of the vote count for each questionanswer, or storing the number of answers for each question, or the number of times a question has been viewed so that these queries dont need to be performed as often. p  pBut does doing this go against db normalization, or any other standardsbestpractices And what is the best way to do this, e.g., should every table have another table for aggregated data, should it be stored in the same table it represents, when should the aggregated data be updatedp  pThanksp

The only conditional option it gives you is to chose whether [NoneAllAny] of the following are true.

Negative 5 pI followed the instruction from Rick Regan a hrefhttpwww.exploringbinary.comhowtoinstallandrungmponwindowsusingmpir relnofollowhttpwww.exploringbinary.comhowtoinstallandrungmponwindowsusingmpira. Unfortunately, for some reasons, the static library only works with C. For C, the compiler always complains about linker problems. There are several differences between the current version that I use 2.4.0 with the version of Rick Regan. On the other hand, I also followed the readme.txt inside codebuild.vc10code folder, but I still couldnt figure out why it was broken. Im running Windows 7 x64 and using Visual Studio 2010  Ultimate. To be more specific    p  ul liFirstly, I download the source of MPIR version 2.4.0 from a hrefhttpwww.mpir.org relnofollowhttpwww.mpir.orga, i.e. codeSource tarball bz2code.li liNext, I download codeyasmcode from a hrefhttpyasm.tortall.netDownload.html relnofollowhttpyasm.tortall.netDownload.htmla. I download both codeWin64.execode and codeWin64 VS2010.zipcode, and put both of them into my codeVCbincode directory. I also renamed the codeyasm1.1.0win64.execode to codeyasm.execode  li liI then open the codempir.slncode inside codebuild.vc10code folder, and build all the codelibcode projects under codereleasecode mode since I just want to use static libraries. li ul  pAfter building those solutions, it generate a folder named codeWin32code, and inside this folder there is another folder named codeReleasecode in which there are four other library filesp  ul limpir.libli limpirrxx.libli limpir.pdbli limpirxx.pdbli ul  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comvTnJo.png altenter image description herep  pBesides, the codelibcode folder inside codebuild.vc10code also generates two other foldersp  ul lipWin32 img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comJuDPN.png altenter image description here  pli lipx64br img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comJt2vv.png altenter image description herepli ul  pNext, I copied all the library files from codebuild.vc10libcode to my codeCProgram Files x86Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0VCincludecode as well as codempir.hcode and codempirxx.hcode to my codeCProgram Files x86Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0VCincludecode.br After finish all these steps, I create a Win32 Console Application project, and add two codeAdditional Optionscode under codeProject PropertiesLinkerCommand Linecode. They are p  ul limpir.libli limpirxx.libli ul  pThen I built some examples with C and it worked as expected. However, when I tried this particular examplep  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt using namespace std  pragma warningdisable 4800 include ltmpirxx.hgt pragma warningdefault 4800  int main int argc, char argv[]      mpzclass aBigPO2      aBigPO2  1073741824 230     aBigPO2aBigPO2 260     aBigPO2aBigPO2 2120     aBigPO2aBigPO2 2240     aBigPO2aBigPO2 2480     aBigPO2aBigPO2 2960     aBigPO2aBigPO2 21920      cout ltlt aBigPO2 ltlt endl  codepre  pIt failed with many errorsp  precode1gtmain.obj  error LNK2001 unresolved external symbol gmpzsetsi 1gtmain.obj  error LNK2001 unresolved external symbol gmpzinit 1gtmain.obj  error LNK2001 unresolved external symbol gmpzmul 1gtmain.obj  error LNK2001 unresolved external symbol gmpzclear codepre  pAnd I have no idea why this happened. I even tried to copy other alternatives from codeWin32code folder but it still produced the same errors. But Im not sure how these files are different though. Im running Windows 7 x64 but I dont think my Visual Studio is x64. I wonder mixing 32bit and 64bit could cause this issue. Any idea Thank you.p

The web application will parse through the content of form submission response, and see if the submission is successful or not.p  pThe script that should be loaded into each iframe within the main window should read the iframe ID, some divs from the main window, and entire content of that iframe, and send it as  a POST request to my web app.p  pCan such a scenario be implemented using Greasemonkey Note that initially when the page with iframes is loaded, at that stage the iframes are blank at this stage no data from iframes should be sent to my web app. Only after user submits all 10 forms, and the iframes are all loaded with respective form submission responses, now the js should send the data within each iframe to my web app.p  pOne more question currently I plan to use Google Chrome with appropriate runtime parameters to disable the same origin policy...But if the above scenario can be implemented using Greasemonkey script, then will I need to disable Same Origin Policy in Firefox also Also, there is an extension in Firefox to add CORS enabler to a web page, can I combine that script with the code for above scenario, so that even if an iframe has different domain compared to main window, even then the data of each iframe is submittedp

Negative 5 pThis question is more for general discussion on sharing values in SpecFlow. Please provide any constructive feedback you may have based on your experience in SpecFlow.p  pI am relatively new to this technology, and when looking for a solution to sharing values among step definition files, I found codeScenarioContext.Current.Getcode and codeScenarioContext.Current.Setcode. These are very handy, but as I see it, there are a couple of problems.p  ol liThere is quite a lot of typing involved in this approach.li liValue types are inserted and retrieved with string indexes, so string constants or enums need to be used to ensure consistency among step definitions.li liIt might not be safe to assume that the value youre trying to retrieve has been inserted.li ol  pI have come up with an abstraction that I think makes some of this a bit easier to live with, and Im wondering what people think about it.p  pstrongProblem has my value been setstrongp  pMy solution to this was to wrap the codeScenarioContext.Currentcode in a singleton accessor class. This class behaves like codeScenarioContext.Currentcode, except that it throws an codeAssertInconclusiveExceptioncode when the value cant be found.p  precode    private static ScenarioContextAccessor instance      public static ScenarioContextAccessor Instance              get                      if instance  null                              instance  new ScenarioContextAccessor                           return instance                    private ScenarioContextAccessor        public T RetrieveltTgtstring index              try                      T val  TScenarioContext.Current[index]             if val  null                              throw new Exception                           return val                  catch                      throw new AssertInconclusiveExceptionindex   of type   typeofT.Name   was not found in the current scenario context.

Any property that accesses a value type uses a string constant as the index.p  precode    private string FolderName              get                      return ScenarioContextAccessor.Instance.RetrieveltstringgtFolderingScenarioContextKey.FolderName                  set                      ScenarioContextAccessor.Instance.SetFolderingScenarioContextKey.FolderName, value                    private UserDocumentMetadata Metadata              get                      return ScenarioContextAccessor.Instance.RetrieveltUserDocumentMetadatagt                  set                      ScenarioContextAccessor.Instance.SetltUserDocumentMetadatagtvalue               codepre  pSo now I can access my shared values as easily as if they were simple properties.p  pPlease offer any emconstructiveem feedback you may have.

Negative 5 pWhile implementing the inapp billing for Android application, I came across a problem.  p  pLet me explain the scenario firstbr We have a content server data server which has the list of products.br When user selects one from the list, he can be able to purchase it.br The purchase logic runs perfectly after I put my credit card detail using my test account.br In returns I am getting a signed data in Android device.  p  pMy Question isbr 1. Should I have to strongverify the signed data in Android devicestrong and then send some information or the data to Content server, which in return sends the product I think this may not be good since there is no flow at server side to verify that the request is valid or not strongor more precisely that the signature data is generated by google market or notstrongbr 2.

Negative 5 pOk so I am trying to make a system that has three parts. A menu, a content area, and a pagination area. Each of these areas, excluding menu, is loaded via a .load call from jquery at run time. I am doing this as a wordpress plugin by the way.p  pFor instance at load, I load the posts.php via .load into the .content class and the page.php via .load into the .pagination class. This is all done with default settings, ie I send default settings via post method of load. The menu code is there from the start. p  pThe issue is with pagination. I would like it so when you click the next page it loads the next content and move the page up on the pagination system, all with out loading the whole page again in wordpress. I figured jquery would work here but the issue is that if I call pagination as a jquery call, when a user clicks the next page, the detection would have to be nested in the first pagination call, right Which because a massive loop. p  pSo the issue is how to make a pagination system that will call the next content and load it into the content area and move the page up in its own system, without having to load the whole page again due to it being a plugin in wordpress.p  pAny helpp  pstrongeditstrong I want to point out that I am newer to jQuery.p

Negative 5 pI have a complex script   that Jenkins executes on build  which needs to check for events in codevarlogsyslogcode. In order to do so, I added the user jenkins to the group syslog belongs to and set the file permissions to 0640.p  pThe script above runs perfectly fine when manually executed, but when invoked by Jenkins build system it fails indeed, the output console shows that the script has not the permission to read codevarlogsyslogcode when invoked via Jenkins.p  pA quick check with codewhoamicode shows that the building process runs with jenkins as user, though. Hence, I cannot understand why the script behavior is different.p
Negative 5 pI was recently asked to try to solve a data integrity problem with a Filemaker database app that has been published to the Web. p  pThis app collects job applicant data, through a series of views. There have been reports from a handful of users that during their experience using the app, they would see another applicants data, while traversing through the application. It seems like these users all exceeded the session timeout threshold and then were revealed somebody elses data in the form.p  pI am looking at the JSESSIONID cookie that is being generated since that is the only link that I see between a browser session and the app. The JSESSIONID cookie is set to expire in the past and is of type sessionp  pThe JSESSIONID values also seem incredibly similar here are two JSESSIONIDS that I received when testing the appp  p 02442D0AA37DEF0512674E8Cbr  02442D09A38288D712674E8E p  pHas anyone experienced a similar issue with Filemaker apps published to the webp  pIs there anyplace else that I need to look besides at the way the JSESSIONID and Filemaker 11 relate In other words, are there other known security vulnerabilities with the Filemaker Web Publishing engine that anyone is aware ofp  pWith appreciation,p  pSlinky66p

Negative 5 pIs there any implementation of strongsparse arraysstrong or equivalent stronglistsstrong in strongFortranstrong.p  pIn the stage of computation of large data set we pass say an array of size of coden10000code to a subroutine to do some stuff on them. For example, finding similar elements in it and listing them for each item sequentially. That is, for item one, to find all similar items through the list array and to store the resulting marks. The resulting could be large as the list for each element. Note that regarding the criteria the similarity we use is not symmetric which means we need to iterate the evaluation for all items fully. The resulting therefore could be in different length for each according to criteria being used. Storing all the results therefore requires sparse arrayslist which is available in Python asp  precode R  an array              an array L  []                    list initialization for e in R               iteration on all elements of R      r  similarse,R,criteria   r is array  different in size for each element     L.appendr           store the ranks in list L code pre  pFor simplicity now we use usual arrays in Fortran where for codenlt1000code it is codenncode.

Negative 5 pI will show some minimum code, since I dont think my company wants me showing a whole lot, although we are currently just doing research.p  pWe are using POCO in Entity Framework 4 to save data back to a database.  We are using data annotations to try to reduce the amount of duplicate validation we have to do which was a problem with our old classic ASP solution, where we had the SAME validation occurring on three different levels of the application.p  pWe want to include business rules in our model, which includes making sure that fields that are validated against other tables are valid we dont use dropdowns in our model, so users can type in anything.  For example, we are storing room information in a building.  The room has a field called Room Type.  Valid room types are defined in a different table.p  pWe also want to have immediate clientside validation.  For example, we have number fields that have to be between 0 and 32767.  If the user types in 1, we use client side validation to immediately respond to the user to let them know 1 is invalid.

Negative 5 pIm currently working on a new game for iOS using Cocos2D. The game needs to advance states after x amount of time since the first launch. So for examplep  blockquote   pState  Timep      ol   liinitial launchli   li24hrs li   li48hrsli   ol blockquote  pMy first idea was to just get the data and time on first launch and save it to a file.  Then I could check it ever now and again to see how much time has passed. The problem with this is I need it to be in realtime so that the changes will take effect immediately once the state is reached. It also needs to continue when the user is not using the app. The functionality Im looking for is kind of similar to how the iOS strategy games work where you build structures that take x amount of time. p  pAnyway my questions is is there some sort of library that can accomplish this and how can I get it to continue after the user exits the app p

Negative 5 pI am attempting to create simple top down side scrolling style app in android.  Basically an image sits in the bottom center of the screen which does not move.  A background image behind this will move based on the tilt of the device.p  pIf I dont move translate the image and I rotate it based upon the first images center point, the background image rotates correctly around this point.  If I translate the background image at all however, the rotation is no longer accurate.  It seems that the rotation is applied based on the images Top, Left not the screen top left, so if I translate the image by 100 units down the screen, it now rotates 100 units below where I want it to.p  pBasically I am looking for a way to rotate an image no matter where it is located on the screen by a fixed position on the screen that never changes.  Hopefully this will create the illusion that the image at the bottom of the screen is moving when in fact it is the background that is moving.

Negative 5 pConsider this scenario. I have a small enterprise project dev environment. We use archiva as our artifact repo.p  pIngeneral, I would like to have PROJECTSPECIFIC profiles set up, namely because tests will differ on a perproject basis.p  pHowever, the one thing I would LIKE to have constant, is a profile in my settings.xml file, which is active by default, used for development. Do I need to have my team members manually edit that file and place their ARCHIVA credentials in there ldap system, so that they can access the internal repop  pShould I just not put a password on it My other alternative is using a master password to encrypt a shared password, so nobody could see it, yet they would all have generic readonly access to the internal repo for snapshot dependencies and stuff. However, then they would also need the securitysettings.xml file which contained the encrypted master password, and doesnt that defeat the purpose of that systemp  pfinally can multiple profiles be active at the same time, or is that unnecessary For example, if I have the dev profile active by default which contains the artifact repo settings, encrypted svn credentials for releases, and then I specify different profiles in certain POM files, am I only to pick ONE profile Lets say I want to use Bamboo for CI, and there are some test profiles which use the surefire plugin and whatnot. Will these profiles coexist with the activeByDefault DEV profile that exists in settings.xml, or can only one profile be activated at one time All CI needs is the SCM information, so technically it shouldnt need access to the internal archiva repo, so I suppose that if I was using a test profile automatically using CI, it wouldnt need anything from the  profile.p  pIm confused. Im so close to having a fully mavenmanaged build environment, just trying to iron out those few kinks. Thank you.p

Negative 5 pIm looking to build a pipeline pattern with Scala. I wish after I write the pipeline objects, they could be connected together like thisp  precodePipeline1  Pipeline2  Pipeline3 ... codepre  pI have experimented with a few ideas so far. Some work and some dont. But none of them seems to completely get rid of boilerplate code. The following is the closest Ive got.p  pFirst define the Pipeline and Source abstract classp  precode I is the input type and O is the output type of the pipeline abstract class Pipeline[I, O]p Pipeline[,  lt I]     val source  p   val name String   def produce O   def statsString  abstract class Source[T] extends Pipeline[AnyRef, T]null codepre  pNext, I created two pipelines and try to link them togetherp  precode this creates a random integer class RandomInteger extends Source[Int]    override val name  randInt    def produce       scala.Math.roundscala.Math.random.asInstanceOf[Float]  10       def statsthis pipeline is stateless    multiply it by ten class TimesTenp Pipeline[, Int] extends Pipeline[Int, Int]p    private var count  0  this is a simple state of the pipeline   override val name  Times   def produce       val i  source.produce     count  1  updating the state     i  10      def stats  this pipeline has been called for   count   times   object TimesTen     this code achieves the desired connection using     but this has to be repeated in each pipeline subclass.     how to remove or abstract away this boilerplate code    def that Pipeline[, Int]  new TimesTenthat  codepre  pThis is the main class where two pipelines are linked.p  precodeobject Pipeline    def mainargs Array[String]      val p  new RandomInteger  TimesTen     printlnp.source     for i lt 0 to 10       printlnp.produce     printlnp.stats     codepre  pSo this code works. But I would have to repeat the code in the TimesTen companion object in every pipeline class I write. This is certainly not desirable. Is there any better way to do this Reflection might work, but I heard bad things about it, such as anything involving reflection is bad design. Im also unsure about Scalas support for reflection.p  pThank you for your time.p  pstrongUpdatestrong I designed this toy problem to make it easy to understand. As a general solution, and as my application requires, each pipeline object has a state, which is ideally encapsulated within the object itself rather than exposed to every other pipeline. I have modified the code above to reflect this. I wish there could be an objectbased solution. Im still experimenting and will let you know if I find one.p  pstrongUpdate 2strong After some thoughts, I think the idea of the pipeline is really just a generalized function that contains some internal states as well as the ability to compose a codeFunction0code function with a codeFunction1code function. In Scala, the codeFunction0code class does not have the codecomposecode or codeandThencode method. p

But if its not then the node with stop itself strongemand All node before that stopemstrong will be removed. p  pThis has to be occurred in the same section id and it will delete only the user node leave the section id even if it is empty after deletion of user node.

Negative 5 pI am facing a problem.p  pI have a href which calls a javascript function deleteelementonpage when i click on it.p  pSo when i click the HREF with my mouse, everything is fine and the function gets called.p  pHowever, because the HREF has focus, if keep hitting my enter key, the function gets called again and again and again leading to undesired outcomes.p  pHow can i prevent this from happeningp  pI was thinking of  1. Blurring the focus on the href when my function is called  I could do this, but this will mean I have to manually do this for every single HREF because jquery.blur can only be triggered at an individual element level.

Negative 5 pI have narrowed down an earlier question I asked and found out what is wrong, but cannot solve it. p  pI have a variable that needs to be set within one event function BEFORE the next event fires.p  pThis is not happening, because I retrieve the variable via an Ajax call. And even though I think I have all the ajax settings right   it doesnt happen. I am using console logging in Firebug, and the console log with 2 in it gets logged BEFORE the other log entry that should be made first with 1 in it. p  pIts part of a datepicker instance, with an ajax call. Full code below. By the way  I have taken the ajax call out, and inserted a hardcoded variable to test  and it works perfectly. So it is the ajax that is not working correctly.p  pThe variable varDate is declared outside the document ready functionp  precodeltscript typetextjavascriptgt  var varDate  toby document.readyfunction codepre  p... and the main code here p  precode.subjectdatepick.datetimepicker     timeFormat hhmmss,     startDate01011996,     clickInputtrue,     beforeShow functioninput,inst           var source    inst.id.attrsource         var sourceid    inst.id.attrsourceid         var thing  .ajax             type GET,              url ajaxgetunavailabledates.php,             dataType text,             async false,             global false,             data                  sourcetype source,                 sourcedbid sourceid                   ,             success functionmsg                    console.log1  got the result                  varDate  msg                               console.log2  ajax complete  logging console              console.logPost AjaxvarDate      , codepre  pWhat the console does here  is log the variable incorrectly first with the SECOND logging event, and then the next event for the datepicker fires.

Negative 5 pIn its simplest form, the problem is as follows. I have two divs Ldiv and Rdiv filling up my screen. Widths are 60 and 40 respectively, and heights vary according to the amount of content. Ldiv floats left and Rdiv floats right. The problem is that, as I narrow the window and push Rdiv against Ldiv, I seem to lose the right margin of Rdiv unless I make its width 3539 instead of 40. I have tried wrapping both inside an enclosing div container but this hasnt worked any better.p  pCan this be fixed by making one of the divs say, Ldiv a fixed width in which case the layout is not entirely liquid, but that wouldnt matter too much Ive read a number of posts here which say this is the way to go, but I cant see why it should. Many others say that with only 2 divs they should both float, but is there a nonfloating alternativep  pThanksp

Negative 5 pI have a page that I am using an Ajax Accordion and when I run the site it works perfectly fine,  but when I am in the design view of VS2010 everything looks like a jumbled mess. The accordion is put into what to me looks like a list box, there are no panes to minimize, and there is a lot of scrolling up and down to look at the controls that are in each pane.p  pI am not sure if this is just how it is supposed to be or if I am doing something wrong, because in my work with dreamweaveralthough its not an Ajax Accordion I found that you could collapse each pane in its design view, and it would more accurately show the look of what you have just created. So is there any way to achieve thisp  pIf there is any code that could be useful I can provide it, Thank youp

Negative 5 pstrongUpdate 2strong emI think this is a better explanationemp  pI have two callbacks, and each is filling up an array. I want to merge these arrays somehow. The naive way to do it is to wait until the arrays are filled, then merge with a for loop. I cant do that because theres no real way to check if the callbacks are done.p  pThe next step might be something like this Each time an object is downloaded by a callback, it checks the merge array called mixed, and sees if it contains a partner object. If it does then merge into that partner object. If it doesnt, then insert that object. p  pIm worried about race conditions callback 1 sees the array is empty, decides to insert into it, but then control switches to callback 2, which inserts first. Callback 1 should now merge instead of insert, but when control switches back, it inserts instead.p  pWhat could help is if I could make an atomic check and insertmerge block of code. Is there a way to do thatp  hr  pstrongUpdate 1strong Now with code, and more wordsp  pThanks for your response, everyone. I went and tried to simplify the code as much as I could. p  pstrongWordsstrongp  pI have an array called mixed. Mixed should end up with all objects of type A, and if they have analogue objects of type B also known as privates, they should be merged. p  pThat means using two functions that use callbacks  getAllA and getAllB. Right now, I call both, wait a bit manually, then run a for loop that does that merging.p  pWhat I need to do is edit my code so that the merging happens in callbacks. However, I cant think of a way to do that merging in a way that doesnt create a race condition. p  pNaively, I might want to first fill up mixed with objects of type A, then go iterate through the B objects and merge them as needed. However, I cant do that because theres no way to see if youre done with oncontactadded in firebase. What I think I want is a concurrent array structure, but I dont know how to use a builtin one. Im worried about making my own because I dont know how to check to if I did it wrong.

Negative 5 pIm writing an application that will enable the creation of SQL files within visual studio. The user will enter commands via the Package Manager console which will generate sql scrips and deposit them in a specific directory within the Visual Studio Project.p  pThe problem I have is that, when the files are generated, they are present on the file system, but not in Visual Studio. This is expected of course, as I need to then go and actively include the files within Solution explorer, but this isnt what I want. I want the files to Magically appear in solution explorer immediately after theyre generated.p  pIve seen various solutions to similar problems mostly featuring amendments to the .csproj file such as thisp  precodeltCompile IncludeSql.sql gt codepre  pbut this isnt what im looking for. What im after is similar to how, for example, Entity Framework or MvcScaffolding work, where files  folders just magically drop into the project when commands run in PMC.

This is not happening when I click or touch on  a href link inside the content page.p  pCan you help mep

Negative 5 pOur application builds an Access database .mdb and then starts a different application with the codeShellcode command which needs ReadWrite Access to this very database. The problem is that on some systems our application seems erratically  to retain an exclusive lock on the database, preventing the other application from accessing it. Only after closing down the first application can the other application proceed.p  pThe specific Error that is raised is Error 3028, which seems to be specific for DAO 3.51 Access 97 which we indeed employ. I cannot understand why some systems are affected and then not consistently and others never. I thought that it might be a timing issue and built in a codeSleepcode period between building the database and launching the other application, but that does not help.p  pWhat is going onp  pEDIT I now created a workaround by creating the database in a separate file and then copying it. Now the second program should always be able to access it and any remaining lock problems will surface in the first program, which I maintain. I will follow up later when our users have been able to test this.p

Negative 5 pHello and thanks in advance for your response.p  pI have my licensed app uploaded to the Play Store. I can test and get expected results with all of the static test license responses Licensed, Not Licensed, etc. So far so good.p  pBut if my test device has no internet connection, the license check ALWAYS fails. This is not how I understand the ServerManaged policy to work. If an install is found to have been licensed sometime in the recent past, the policy is supposed to cache information in a shared prefs file and use it if there is no internet connection.p  pSo I temporarily commentedout the obfuscation of the data in the prefs file that the license system creates. When I look at the data, I see that the retry count and other stuff is set to zero. This is not what I expect. With data like this, it is behaving for me as if I were using a Strict policy and I am not.p  pI am presuming that this is an artifact of using the test response system and that real users will get actual data in their obfuscated shared prefs that permits them to operate in the absence of an internet connection.p  pSo I have tried setting the server response to Respond Normally. When I do this, I ALWAYS get a NOT LICENSED response. And I guess this makes some sense because I have not purchased the app and downloaded it.p  pSo how can I, as the developer, experience exactly what my endusers experience I want to be able to test how this all works without an internet connection, for example. I cannot seem to figure out how to do this I guess I could purchase my own app but I am not sure that will even work since the test device is logged into the test account. And it makes no sense for a developer to have to purchase their own app.p  pThanks for any suggestions.p

Negative 5 pUsing Googles Visualization API, I use google.visualization.data.group to create subtables based on my raw data. My raw data uses the trick of vUS, fUnited States to display something other than the value, but when I use the aggregation function, the formatting is eliminated leaving only the US portion.p  pIs there any way to retain the original formatting, or an easy way to add it back on DataTables created using the group aggregationp  pSample datap  precode[2010, vMA, fMorocco, v002, fAfrica, v002, fNorthern Africa, 21.12724], [2010, vAW, fAruba, v019, fAmericas  , v019, fCaribbean, 0.98], [2010, vAF, fAfghanistan, v142, fAsia, v142, fSouthern Asia, 0.9861], [2010, vAO, fAngola, v002, fAfrica, v002, fMiddle Africa, 5.11774], codepre  pAggregation Functionp  precodevar countryData  google.visualization.data.group   rawData,    [0, 1],    [column 4, aggregation google.visualization.data.sum, type number]  codepre  pEditp  pOn further thought, its probably impossible to group with format since there is no guarantee that the format for each value will be consistent. With that in mind, its probably better or only possible to write a function that will add the formats to each column of my data. So the question becomes, How the heck do I do thatp  pI would really rather not create my raw data as unformatted values alone, and then additional tables for looking up the formats for each value. That would require an additional 2 tables one for regions which is 28 rows, one for countries which is over 240 rows, and then creating two functions to look through each value in the grouped table which will have 30 years of data, meaning thousands of lines adding the values.p  pThat seems like a really complex solution.p  pIs there some way to do this with modifier functions Can I write a function to return each value in the table as a v US, f United States formatted object Or is there an easy way to write a column formatter that will look up the appropriate value in my original table and adopt that format Which would cause the least headaches both for me who has to write it, and for the users who have to load itp  pEDIT 2p  pIt looks like I should be able to create a formatter for the new table using something like thisp  precodefunction dt, row      return          v dt.getValuerow, 1  1000000,         f dt.getValuerow, 1  1000000  M       codepre  pBut the issue becomes that since I am not dealing with number formats, I would have to create some sort of lookup table that will take the value, look it up in a lookup table, and then return the appropriate format. It also looks like I may have to loop through the whole table, row by row, which is thousands of lines.p  pI cant imagine that there isnt an easy way to do this without some brute force looping and assigning values.p  pEDIT 3p  pSo I tried something tricky. Rather than setting each row as a valueformat, I created the valueformat portion as a string, and then after grouping used eval to evaluate the objects. This worked great. Here is the datap  precode[2010, v MA, f Morocco, 21.13], [2010, v AW, f Aruba, 0.98], [2010, v AF, f Afghanistan, 0.99], [2010, v AO, f Angola, 5.12], codepre  pHere is the new codep  precode  var countryCount  countryData.getColumnRange0.count    for var i  0 i lt countryCount i      countryData.setValuei, 1, eval  countryData.getValuei,1      codepre  pThe issue is that when I output this to a Google DataTable, it shows v AE, f United Arab Emirates despite the fact that checking the result with eval properly gives mep  precodegtgtgt eval  countryData.getValuei,1   Object vAE fUnited Arab Emirates codepre  pSo what am I doing wrong herep

Then gearman executes the code to get a particular file but that file was on the server that went down. How can I setup gearman to wait for the server that went down to finally get the right file... Also it might happen that the servers might not go down but since gearman talks to the other servers it might execute the code on another machine looking for a file that is on another server.p  pHow can I get around this problem  Without having to isolate each gearman servers from each other. Because I will use it for other things that dont have the same restrains.p

Negative 5 pIm taking the first steps into the MvvmCross framework and Im trying to decide the best approach in terms of project and classes structure.  My biggest concern now is to decide how should I organize my viewmodels in order to share data between them and at the same time to follow the mvvm guidance.p  pI have simple example  with to views and respective viewmodels Main and Configuration. The main view has some controls binded to properties in the viewmodel. The configuration view enables the user to change text color, number of items in the list, etc... When the user changes the configuration, this should be reflected in the main view.p  pMy first approach was to create separate view and viewmodels. But how could I notify the main view that the configuration was changed  I saw the Sphero project under a hrefhttpsgithub.comslodgeBallControl relnofollowGithubSlodgea and I realized that a viewmodel has direct references to other views. In this way, it is fairly easy to notify the main view each time the configuration changed. But isnt this a deviation of the decoupled viewmodels that mvvm recommendsp  pCould I get some insights on the best way to approach this type of class structuringp

Negative 5 pI would like to make a good performance hit test for png images and other shapes. I dont really care what shapes they are because with this technique there is no performance issues at checking not setup.p  pI intent to collect all the images on the screen in a secondary canvas just for hit test. For each image drawn I will create a new color which is attached to that particular image. Then I draw all of them in the canvas, each image will have a different fill color.p  pWhen I click on a pixel x, y it will get the color r, g, b. Every color is mapped to a image, so I get the image clicked with no error I dont waste with finding what was hit with that click.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comH3t61.png altenter image description herep  pI know it will be limited to 25625625616 777 216 items because those are all the colors but I dont think it will be a problem for now...p  pSo what I really need is to know how to put those fill colors on the secondary canvas which is based only on the visible pixels for each image.p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comt0ucP.png altenter image description here As you can see to the right its the hit test map. So if I click on the black shade c I instantly know Ive clicked on the blue box without any other calculation.p  pOne improvement it would be to cache the alpha data. Also reuse the same alpha data for each image instance we must take care about scaling and rotation.... p  pthanksp

Negative 5 pIve recently started working on a new project and have come across some difficulties using the AjaxControlToolkit more specifically the AjaxFileUpload control.  Ive used this toolkit and control on other projects successfully but Im not sure whats going on in this one.  Ive referenced the AjaxControlToolkit, put the required lines in my web.config, put the required lines in my aspx pages and set up a script manager and everything seems to be good.  The site launches without error and it sort of shows up but its not working properly.  Basically whats showing up is a blacked out box that looks like the Upload button, which when clicked allows me to select a file.  However none of the other functionality of the control is working.  The first two blocks in the image are two seperate FileUploadControls and the 3rd block is an asyncfileupload control....Anyone have any idea whats going onp  psee image here a hrefhttpimg571.imageshack.usimg5713417screenshot20130223at111.png relnofollowhttpimg571.imageshack.usimg5713417screenshot20130223at111.pngap  precodelt Register AssemblyAjaxControlToolkit NamespaceAjaxControlToolkit TagPrefixAjaxControlToolkit gt at top of page    ltAjaxControlToolkitToolkitScriptManager IDtsm1 runatservergtltAjaxControlToolkitToolkitScriptManagergt on page  ltAjaxControlToolkitAjaxFileUpload IDajaxupload1 runatserver gton page         ltpagesgtweb.config         ltcontrolsgt             ltadd tagPrefixAjaxControlToolkit namespaceAjaxControlToolkit assemblyAjaxControlToolkitgt         ltcontrolsgt     ltpagesgt  codepre  pAs Ive said the project builds and launches fine, no errors, and as you can see in the screenshot it attempts to build the controls but something is off...p

Negative 5 pIm look for the how do you find it because I have no idea how to approach finding the algorithm complexity of my program.p  pI wrote a sudoku solver using java, without efficiency in mind I wanted to try to make it work recursively, which i succeeded withp  pSome backgroundp  pmy strategy employs backtracking to determine, for a given Sudoku puzzle, whether the puzzle only has one unique solution or not. So i basically read in a given puzzle, and solve it. Once i found one solution, im not necessarily done, need to continue to explore for further solutions. At the end, one of three possible outcomes happens the puzzle is not solvable at all, the puzzle has a unique solution, or the puzzle has multiple solutions.p  pMy program reads in the puzzle coordinates from a file that has one line for each given digit, consisting of the row, column, and digit. By my own convention, the upper left square of 7 is written as 007.p  pImplementationp  pI load the values in, from the file, and stored them in a 2D array I go down the array until i find a Blank unfilled value, and set it to 1. And check for any conflicts whether the value i entered is valid or not. If yes, I move onto the next value. If no, I increment the value by 1, until I find a digit that works, or if none of them work 1 through 9, I go back 1 step to the last value that I adjusted and I increment that one using recursion. I am done solving when all 81 elements have been filled, without conflicts. If any solutions are found, I print them to the terminal. Otherwise, if I try to go back one step on the FIRST element that I initially modified, it means that there were no solutions.p  pHow can my programs algorithm complexity  I thought it might be linear [ On ], but I am accessing the array multiple times, so im not sure p  pAny help is appreciatedp

Negative 5 pIve got a program that uses Jetty version 8 to send an http post.  My response handler works, but Im getting an http response code 303, which is a redirect.  I read a comment that jetty 8 has support for following these redirects, but I can not figure out how to set it up.

Negative 5 pFor a project Im currently working on Ive noticed that many of the set lookups Im doing come clustered, so even though my set contain 100k elements, lookups are highly predictable, so that if I now lookup X, my next lookup will be X with 90 probability.

Before I implement something like this myself, are there any existing libraries for doing this Any advicep

Negative 5 pI have a .NET Web solution with an Azure Cloud Service project and a single webrole. I deploy it to the East coast West coast datacompute centers for failover purposes and have been asked to automate the deployment using Powershell MSBuild and Jenkins.p  pThe problem is i need to change the Sql Azure database connectionString in the Web.config prior to packaging and publishing to each deployment. Seems simple enough.p  pI understand that the webrole properties Settings tab allows you to add custom configuration properties to each deployment with a type of either string or Connection String but it looks like the Connection String option applies to only Blob, Table or Queue storage. If I use the String and give it an Sql Azure connection string type it writes it out as an  keyvalue pair and Entity Framework and the Membership Provider do not find it.p  pIs there a way to add a perdeployment connection string setting that points to Sql Azurep  pThanks,p  pDavidp

Negative 5 pGenerally, when youre documenting code using Doxygen, you place the comments directly before or after whatever it is youre documenting.

For any transformations on this triangle and I assume all shaperenderers that occur and then get emdrawnem, these transformations then affect all meshes. This is a real pain.p  pAs transformations on meshes are handled by actually altering the vertices what I could see in the source, I think something else is at play where the OpenGL transformations are not being reset after the ShapeRenderer is transformed Its very frustrating and it does seem like a glitch but it would be a pretty big one seeing as I cant see it not being spotted until now. Any suggestionsp  pIm running on the latest nightly build of LibGDX using OpenGL ES 1.xp
Negative 5 pYes this might be a duplicate of a million other questions like it, but for me it still doesnt work.

Given the restriction of 10,000 URLs per file im going to need to make a sitemap index and link to at least 6 sitemap files in that index.p  pI dont know what the most efficient way of doing this is. My idea was to go to my DB, take the codeTOP 10000code rows, run my codeforeachcode on the data and generate my links. My first idea was to create placeholder sitemap files eg. sm1.xml, sm2.xml, etc. and after each 10,000 rows increment the file index and insert the next 10,000 into the next file. The problem is that the data in the DB is always being added to, so next month I could have 70,000 URLs  meaning Id have to create another placeholder file.p  pSo with this in mind, Id like to create the individual sitemap files dynamically but I dont know how. p

Negative 5 pI currently have a Macro which is connecting to a sybase database using ODBC. Its making the connection by running the followingp  pSet conX  wrkODBC.OpenConnectionConnection1, , True, strConnp  pwhere strConn  ODBCDSNServerNameAPPDaily TaskDBdbnameUIDunamePWDpwdp  pThe problem I am having is that this connection is working for some ServerNames but not others. When it doesnt work I get a  Error 3146  ODBCcall failed.p  pWhat I dont understand is where it is pulling the server details from. So for example, when using embarcadero rapid to connect to a sybase database, it will use the sql.ini file to pull the server connection details based on the servername.p  pI have checked and all the Sybase Servers I am testing are in the sql.ini file and my env variables are pointing to the correct sybase version. Ive checked ODBC and it is only picking up a SQL Server driver.p  pCan anyone please explain how ODBC pulls the server name connection details I dont understand why it works for some server names, but not others FYI, I have tested the uname and pwd is rapid to make sure it is correct.p  pAny information would be much appreciated.  p

Negative 5 pIm just beginning to get into flash game programming. I know enough to make a functioning project, but not how to make it efficient or do specific tasks, in this case how to add a preloader. Ive found several tutorials online, but none that go along with how Ive seen is the best method to program. From what Ive seen, it is best to program all of my code into one .as file and link this file to the main document. This makes it easy for me to make all of my variables global in scope, which lets me addChildremoveChild in various different functions. The only problem is that I cant find a tutorial on creating a preloader with this method in mind. All tutorials that Ive found generally have two frames in the timeline, one with the preloader and one with the content, but Ive been told this is not a good way to program. If anyone could help Id appreciate it a lot. I can paste the source code of one of my learning projects if it would help to provide an answer to my question.p

Negative 5 pI have a config file formatted as JSON that I need to load into Perl and then partially overrideextend with new settings loaded from a separate JSON file.  The particular settings that might be addedchanged vary, so I want to make this override as flexible as I can.p  pMy plan is to merge a new partial config into the existing full config object  either in JSON or as a Perl nested data structure after using decodejson.  That conversion works fine.p  pIs there a simple and efficient way to do this in Perl, short of recursively walking through my complex data structure and making a lot of specific comparisons  Ive looked into HashMerge and it is mangling my data.

Negative 5 pIve been trying out google app engine endpoints api as a backend for a new project. The app engine project is working fine, but im struggling to find information  about how to structure my android application.p  pIve moved all my data models from the android project over to the app engine project  for the purpose of creating Endpoints.  However ive created multiple endpoints for the same entity, for example ive created one searchEndpoint and one personEndpoint for the same model Person.p  pWhen I generate client libraries i get multiple Person models in the android application. This means that i cant really use the model in my android application.p  pSo my question is Is it recommended to use the endpoint models on the client side Or do i need to create wrapper classes on the backend side and convert them to my own model on the android application.p  pIt seems like the point of using the client libraries over a normal HTTPRequest disappears if i dont use the model classes directly.p

Negative 5 pI have inherited some code in a recent project that makes use of some CSS3 selectors to add classes to some top level tab navigation. Due to the way this has been implemented on the backend, the JS is searching the window.location.pathname to match a string, and then using that in another function to add the classname in the DOM.

Negative 5 pI have a couple of if statements within a timer function, checking if the enemys hp is 0. The enemies are added into an array. When one enemy hp hits 0, they are taken from the array and removed. When the array length is 0, the game goes to the next level. For some reason, when the first enemys hp reaches 0, then it automatically goes to the next level without even checking the other enemys hp. It worked on the first level, where I only had 1 enemy, but the second level, I have two enemies. I would have to defeat the second enemy, then the first in order for it to go to the next level.

Negative 5 pI have a CMS I built using Classic ASP with VBscript.p  pId like to convert the registration page to ASPX and make it work ASYNC AJAX so that a person can change one field and that field autoupdates the database but not the whole page.p  pOptimally, I can send Session variables to that page from my .ASP but it is not necessary Important. I dont want to choose the wrong framework just in order to keep my session vars I am happy to manually save a cookie to the users machine or even use a querystring so that when they pull up the ASPX registration page, it knows who it is talking to. Session vars depend on cookies anyway so no biggy.p  pOh Another factor It would be great if I could utilize as much of my existing Classic ASP code on that page as possible.

Negative 5 pOkay, so I lately have been reading about ES5 lexical environment scope and I am not sure if I really understand what is going on with how variables are stored in EcmaScript. I did some research but it didnt clarified my information, only brought me up to two questions. So there they arep  ol lipThe first one is about ES3 codeactivations objectscodecodevariable objectscode. After reading ES3 Specification and some sources on the Internet I can assume that they are just normal object, for example like those created by codenew Objectcode, but none of the sources says yes, this is just a plain object directly. Moreover, Dmitry Soshnikov wrote on his blog the emphasis is minep  blockquote   pstrongSchematically and for examplesstrong, it is possible to present variable object as a normal ECMAScript objectp blockquote  pand that quotation doesnt let me be sure about what really an activation object is. So this is the first question is an activation object a regular EcmaScript object If not, then what is it otherwisepli lipIn ES5 we now have codeobject environment recordscode, which seem to be more or less the same that ES3 activation objects, and codedeclarative environment recordscode, which replaced activation objects in functions and trycatch statement. So, assuming that object environment records strongarestrong just plain EcmaScript objects, then what is a declarative environment record The specification doesnt clarify this, furthermore, from what Ive read there I cannot imagine that this is not implemented as an object. So, again, if declarative environment records are not ES objects, then what are they and how are they implemented and represented during the code executionpli ol  pThank you very much in advance for brightening that topic for me.p  pstrongEDITstrong I think I need to clarify what is this question about. The main thing that I want to know is what is the exact difference between activation objectsobject environment records and declarative environment records. Thats what Im interested in most.p

Negative 5 pSorry, this is the best title I can come up with.p  pI am hoping someone on here can give me an explanation to this behavior. My employer just decided to upgrade CF 8 to CF 10 yeah, I know. However, some of the servers are on CF 10 and some are on CF 8. I know it is not supposed to be like this but this is not within my control. Anyway, I have the following codes. It breaks in CF 8 but works in CF 10 without errors. In CF 8, it is saying that element a is not defined in local, which is expected and I dont have a problem with that.  After all, local is declared twice and a is not defined in the second one.p  pBut in CF 10, no errors generated and local.a is returned by the function. To me, CF 10 should throw an error either because the same reason why CF 8 fails or because local is a reserved word in CF 10 local was introduced in CF 9.  Why is it that CF 10 does not throw any errorsp  precodeltcfcomponent namemyComponentgt ltcffunction namemyFunction returntypeNumericgt ltcfscriptgt var local  StructNew local.a  1 ltcfscriptgt  ltcfset local  StructNewgt  ltcfif local.a is 0gt lt do something gt ltcfifgt  ltcfreturn local.agt ltcffunctiongt ltcfcomponentgt codepre

By now I have a SQL Statement timed every second to retrieve the Data and show it on the Client. The problem The whole application starts lagging and is slowed down which makes sense. And now I need your help. How can i improve this. I thought about different things. First of all I had the idea to check just every 5 minutes or so, if someone is online. But I dont want to wait 5 minutes, until I see the correct online  offline list. So this opportunity isnt really possible. My next idea was to just retrieve the data, when the Table is updated because someone goes online. I thought of a trigger, but is it possible to write a trigger, which is invoked on update, but calls a Method in my C code I have really no idea, and I hope you can help me.p  pWhat would you recommend for such an application p  pGreetingsp

However, that step does not run if the build fails early. p  pThe problem is that subsequent builds do not always use the same build path and project builds fail due to them looking for registered dlls in the wrong place since theyre still registered in COM from a previous failed build.p  pThe simple solution is to ensure that the unregister script runs at the end of every build regardless of fail or pass, however this is not so easy with our build tool. Is there another way to unregister dllstlbs without their original source file present in its registered path p

Negative 5 pI am trying to improve the development and deployment experience in our company by trying to limit the overhead in using multiple environments. We currently have 3 environments emDebugem, emTestem, emReleaseem. This means I have multiple configuration files codeweb.Debug.configcode, codeweb.Test.configcode, codeweb.Release.configcode.p  pWe are using NuGet packages to deploy the internally developed libraries. The library itself is responsible for the configuration values it uses. This is easily done with a hrefhttpdocs.nuget.orgdocscreatingpackagesconfigurationfileandsourcecodetransformations relnofollowNuGet transformation filesa. Thus, when adding a package to a project, the correct environment transformation file is applied to the correct .config file. Using SlowCheetah and some manual modifications to the csproj file, this works quite well. When switching the build configuration during development, the correct .config file is used when creating a deployment package it also uses the correct .config file.p  pThe problem arises when I want to use a codeparameters.xmlcode file to allow the release manager to change the configuration values when deploying. a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryff39806828vvs.11029.aspx relnofollowHow to Use Web Deploy Parameters in a Web Deployment Packagea He sometimes wants to set up a separate environment to do be able to test certain things, whilst not disturbing the existing test environment. p  pIn theory, the use of a parameters file is the perfect solution. In reality it seems the parameters file is not capable of using the configuration values from the corresponding configuration file when no values are passed. This means that, when we provide a parameters file, we must define the actual default values for each possible replacement value. And of course, this complicates things as their is only one parameters file for all configurations. Always specifying every configuration value when deploying is also not preferred, because this means that, when a configuration value changes, we must change it in two places the NuGet package and the deployment script which deploys to the default environments.p  pWhat would be the easiest way to solve our problem How can we tell the web deploy wizard to use the default values from the .config file generated when creating the deployment package if no value is filled inp

Negative 5 pIm at my wits end trying to test a groovy sql query. The idea is to use groovy to execute a sql query that will pull some data from a legacy MS SQL database and return it in a format that my application can use. Writing the groovy script was simple enough but testing it is another matter. Currently Im using hypersonic to create an inmemory db for testing. When my test runs, I create a table and attempt to populate it with some test data from an xml file. The table creation works fine, but the data insertion fails with user lacks privilege or object not found GROUP.p  pThe problem seems to be that hsql is converting all my column names to uppercase. So even though the actual column name is Group it is being converted to GROUP for the insert statement. GROUP conflicts with the group keyword so the query fails.p  pI have no control over the column name in the legacy DB so I need some sort of workaround.

Negative 5 pI can do the following in my program to get a simple open file dialog and print the selected file path.

Negative 5 pI have a View which will sometimes be occluded by a PopupWindow whose showing is triggered by touching the View. When this happens, Id like to immediately transfer the stream of touch events to the PopupWindow. I cant just overlay a View in the same hierarchy because this happens in an IME covering a fraction of the screen area I need to capture gestures in.p  pIve tried sending an ACTIONCANCEL the the Views root container and dispatching my own ACTIONDOWN MotionEvent to the Popwindow. Ive also tried overriding the bottom Windows root dispatchTouchEvent and dispatchGenericPointerEvent methods to do nothing and return false when the popup is active. Neither of these approaches worked.p  pIf I simply lift my finger after the PopupWindow appears and put it down again, obviously I receive touch events no problem. I need to understand what happens when I do this that makes my original window relinquish touch focus and reset its dispatch state. Calling requestFocusFromTouch on my PopupWindows content view when it appears and before I lift my finger returns false.p  pIm quite happy to subclass and override where necessary, as I have full control over all the components involved.p
Negative 5 h2The problemh2  pIll start with a simplified parsing problem. Suppose Ive got a list of strings that I want to parse into a list of integers, and that I want to accumulate errors.

Ill use codeReadercode here, but we could just as well represent the failure type as something like codePosition gt Throwablecode. We can reuse our first nonwrapping codeInvalidLinecode above.p  precodedef parseLineline String  line.parseInt.leftMap   error gt ReaderInvalidLine Position, error.getMessage   def parseLineslines List[String]  lines.zipWithIndex.traverseU    case line, pos gt parseLineline.leftMap.runpos.toValidationNel  codepre  pOnce again this produces the desired output, but also feels kind of verbose and clunky.p  h2Questionh2  pI come across this kind of problem all the timeIm parsing some messy data and want nice helpful error messages, but I also dont want to thread a bunch of position information through all of my parsing logic.p  pIs there some reason to prefer one of the approaches above Are there better approachesp

Negative 5 pHow can I control the rendering loop frame rate in KineticJS The docs for Kinetic.Animation show a frame rate being passed to the render callback, and Kinetic.Tween seems to have no frame rate logic, but I dont see anyway to force, say, a 30fps when 60fps is possible.p  pLoads of context for the curious follows, but the question is that simple. If anyone reads on, other advice is welcome. If you already know the answer, dont waste your time reading onp  pIm developing a music app that combines some DOMbased GUI controls current iteration using jQuery Mobile and Canvasbased GUI controls using KineticJS. The latter involve some animation. Because the animated elements are triggered by music playback, Im using Kinetic.Tween to avoid the complexity of remembering how long a given note has been playing which Kinetic.Animation would require doing. p  pThis approach works great at 60fps in Chrome on a fast machine but is just slow enough on iOS 6.1 Safari iPad 2 that manipulating controls while animations are happening gets a little janky. Im not using WebGL unless KineticJS or Chrome does this by default for canvas, and thats not an option when I package for native UIWebView.p  pAs Im getting beyond prototype into wanting to make more committed tech decisions, I see the following options, in order of perceived goodnessp  ol lipFigure out how to cap the frame rate. Because my animations heavily use alpha fades but do not involve motion, I believe I could get away with 2030fps and look fine. Could also scale this up on faster devices. pli lipDont respond immediately to touch inputs, but add them to a queue which I poll at a constant interval and only use the freshest for things like touchmove. This has no impact on my noninteractive animated elements, but tackles the problem from the other direction, trying to reduce the load of user interaction. This would require making Kinetic controls static and manually tracking touch coordinates not terrible effort if it actually helped. pli lipRewrite DOMbased GUI to canvasbased KineticJS rewrite WebAudiobased engine to HTML5 audio leverage CocoonJS or Ejecta for GPUacceleration. This means having to handcode stuff like file choosers and nav menus and such bad. Losing WebAudio is pretty serious as it eliminates features like DSP effects and very finegrained, lowlatency timing which is working just fine on an iPad 2. pli lipRewrite the app to separate DOM based GUI and WebAudio from Canvasbased elements, leverage CocoonJS. Im not sure ifhow well this works out, but the fact that CocoonJS passes JavaScript code as strings between the 2 components makes me very skittish about how solid this idea is. Its probably doable, but best case Im very tied to CocoonJS moving forwards. I dont like architecting this way, but maybe its not as bad as it soundspli lipMake animations less juicy. This is least good not because of its design impact but because, as it is, Im only animating 20 simple shapes at any time in my central view component, however they include transparency and span an area 1000x300. Other components like sliders are similarly barebones. In other words, its not very juicy right now.pli lipOvercome severe allergy to ObjectiveC forget about the browser, Android, and that other mobile OS. Have a fast app that performs natively and has shiny Appleapproved widgets. My biggest problem with this approach is not wanting to be stuck in ObjectiveC reality for years, skillsetwise. I just dont like it. pli lipBuy an iPad 3 or later. Since I already am pretending Android doesnt exist I dont have any devices to test, why not pretend no one still has iPad 2 I think this is passing the buck  if I can get acceptable performance on iPad 2, I will feel confident about the apps performance as I add more features. pli ol  pI may be overlooking options or otherwise naive about how to tackle this. Some would say what Im trying to build is just silly. But its working empretty wellem just not ready for prime time on the iPad 2. p

Negative 5 pstrongOriginal Questionstrongp  pSo Ive been reading up alot on how to do a Perspective transform on an image in pure Python but I cant get it to work. p  pThe transform itself is pretty simple, its just a small equation, but Im having trouble with the function for creating the coefficients from certain anchor points in the image. Ive gotten a working code that completes without errors with the help of the excellent numpybased answer a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions14177744howdoesperspectivetransformationworkinpilfrom another posta, but my issue is that Im trying to do this in purePython. The coefficients turn out redicilously low, and nothing pops up on my resulting image. p  pOne issue could be in the porting of the numpy functions like dotmatrix, multiplication, and inverse matrix that Im trying to do in pure Python functions.

Negative 5 pIve been thinking about scheduling and load balancing algorithms, and I came up with a problem that I think is interesting.p  pThere are N cages and M zookeepers. Each cage has a size S and a number of animals A. The frequency with which a cage must be cleaned is computed as some function of A  S smaller cages with more animals get dirty faster. The difficulty of cleaning a cage is computed as some other function of A and S, the details of which are unimportant the size of a cage contributes most of the difficulty, and the number of animals contributes a little. Once every three days, any cages that are due for cleaning are cleaned cleaning day. Zookeepers are completely identical and interchangeable. Zookeepers need to do a similar amount of work each cleaning day, and to not have to do much more work than any other zookeeper. The duration of time that a cage takes to clean is not part of the problem its assumed that time is roughly reflected by difficulty, and that there is always enough time in the day for a zookeeper to complete their assigned tasks.p  pThe scheduling algorithm must tell each zookeeper which cages to clean on each cleaning day, such thatp  ul lieach cage is cleaned at its ideal frequency or as close as possible,li liassigning a minimal and roughly equal number of cleanings per zookeeper per cleaning day,li liand assuring as equal a workload as possible across all zookeepers i.e., over a period of time, the aggregate difficulties of each zookeepers workload are as close to equal as possible, and cages are distributed among zookeepers with roughly 1M probability.li ul  pIm wondering what an approximation algorithm for such an optimization problem would look like. It bears a resemblance to several different classic examples of NPhard schedulingresource utilization problems maybe it is reducible to one such problem and Im just missing it. If we get rid of the frequencyperiodicity of tasks element, it is similar to the classic a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiMultiprocessorscheduling relnofollow titleMultiprocessor schedulingmultiprocessor schedulinga or finite a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiBinpackingproblem relnofollow titleBin packing problembin packinga problem.p

Negative 5 pWhile using codeSwingWorkercode to sequentially update my front end, I think I may have found a bug.p  pI have create a server which listen for connections. A connection might only initiate in a few minutes, so I created a little connecting animation that plays while the server is waiting for a new incoming connection. p  pA codeSwingWorkerltT,Tgtcode is used to update a codeJLabelcode every 0.5 seconds with a character, which in the end, creates a character that bounces from one end of the panel to next, upon connection, the animation is removed and the codeJLabelcode is updated with different text.p  pThis has been working all fine and dandy, but I have recently realised that the animation sometimes freezes, but yet, every time I ran the animation, it stopped and the codeJLabelcode updated correctly.p  pstrongI then realised that the codeJLabelcode text does not update when I am on a different workspace.strongbr emEdit Where workspace refers to the ability to switch between desktops workspaces in Linux Im on Linux Mint 15.

Negative 5 pIm using Asterisk 11, a Cisco SPA303 Phone, and Twilio.p  pI can make outgoing phone calls without any issue and the call quality is top notch. On an incoming call however, my extension and phone ring, however when I answer the phone, there is no audio on either end and 30 seconds later, both calls end. Using Twilios PCAP log, it shows that my asterisk server sends a BYE when answered. Asterisk however does not log a single thing on incoming calls. All SIP traffic is logged on outgoing calls. Does anyone have any idea whats going onp  pUpdate Turns out that I had my incoming extensions in the wrong context, once that was updated, incoming and outgoing calls worked without a hitch. I marked arheops as the answer because the logging of unanswered calls lead to the diagnosing of the problem.p

Negative 5 pI have been looking at Swift the last couple of days and it looks good, I am confused on a point though even after review of the guide Apple published.p  pI understand that memory management in Swift uses ARC and therefore quite safe, however in situations where Id like more fine grained control of object creation and destruction Im slightly confused.p  pTake these two simple examplesp  pIn ObjC, when youd for example like a UIViewController you intend to push to stay around for the lifetime of your app and only be created once say because its expensive to create, youd make it a property and then wrap its Alloc Init like thisp  pif self.myProperty      self.myProperty  [[MyObj alloc] init] p  pThis way it only creates once, keeps state and the same object instance can be reused indefinitely, yielding known object references, and good performance not having to recreate each time the viewController goes out of scope.p  pAnother example of this is with NSMutableString, vs Swifts String.p  pYou can set an NSMutableStrings string many times and it will keep the same object reference, however this doesnt seem to be the case with a Swift String when changing it.p  pThis may just be deprecated thinking in Objective C but is there a best practice with regard to keeping around expensive objects or to keep state same object for certain objects during the lifetime of their usage.p

Negative 5 pTake the case when a big chunk of some parent repository is taken as a mostly starting point for another child repository, deleted from the original, and made a submodule instead.  All of this has already been completed and is in the past now.p  pI see that code.gitinfograftscode would allow one to preserve the history for codegitblamecode and codegitannotatecode, and can possibly be employed ex post facto.p  pHowever, what if the files are not exactly the same  E.g. one version was deleted from the old original parent repo, and a slightly modified version was committed to the new submodule child one  Can a reference still be made  Especially if both repositories continue to be updated, and one would rather not have to deal with rewriting any past history any more than need be.p

Negative 5 pI am working on a user space tcp stack mostly just for fun and I am having some trouble testing it against the unix tcp stack. Currently the only form of testing is done via unit tests. However, I want to test my tcp stack against a real kernel tcp stack. I tried the following setups without much success. p  ul lipusing raw sockets I wrote a simple echo tcp server that accepts connection using the kernel tcp socket. The tcp server listens to port 8080 on localhost. My tcp client uses the user space tcp stack. However, the kernel sends a tcp rst whenever the client sends a syn to the server. It kind of work after I modified iptable to drop all tcp rst packets. However, even though the 3 way syn, synack, ack handshake is established, the server cannot recv any packet that my client sends. I eventually gave up on raw sockets.pli lipusing tuntap Similarly the echo server uses kernel tcp socket and listens on localhost port 8080. The client opens a tap device. The tap device has an ip of 10.0.0.1 and my client assumes an ip of 10.0.0.2. I am able to ping 10.0.0.2 from my computer. However, when my client sends a syn to the tcp server over the tap device, the server does not respond. pli ul  pNote I am using ubuntu 12.04.p

Negative 5 pIm currently working on a java project in eclipse that uses 64bit SWT libraries. A lot of the computers this program might be used on have 32 bit operating systems, so to avoid making a 32bit and a 64bit version, I want to explore dynamically loading a 32bit or 64bit SWT library depending on the JRE being used at the time.p  pI found some references to using ClassLoader, ServiceLoader, and similar objects, however Im not sure how that would fit in with eclipses structure, and if eclipses structure even allows for this type of loading in the first place. Additionally, I am unsure how to check which jvm is being used inside the code, which I assume would be a prerequisite for knowing which SWT libraries would load correctly.p  pIf you guys would be able to provide any suggestions or directions in which to focus my research, that would be great. Im currently pretty unsure on how to proceed.p  pThanksp

Negative 5 pI am trying to process some business logic after user hit a URL. There will be a heavy loop running in server side. The browser will be loading we can see the spinning animation on top while waiting server return the result. p  pWe dont discuss is that correct or not to perform heavy loop in HTTP connection, my question is that, while the browser is waiting for the result, and, if user want to stop the processing, by closing the browsertab or pressing ESCAPE or pressing the X cross button at the browser bar, likely, the browser will stop to receive any data from server side. Now, my problem is, the server thread that is processing heavy loop will not stop somehow even browser not to receive data anymore. How am I going to stop thatp  pI thought that, according TCP transmission, if one end of sockets is closed, another end will be notified and closed as well. I expect my server will have something like socket close exception thing thrown out by the codeServletcode. But it is not, so the loop in codeServletcode is still running until it finished. Any idea how can I stop it It will lead to Out of memory issue if the user keep on hitting the URL and cancel the request.p

Negative 5 pThe w3c standard for the deviceorientation eventp  pa hrefhttpw3c.github.iodeviceorientationspecsourceorientation.htmldeviceorientation relnofollowhttpw3c.github.iodeviceorientationspecsourceorientation.htmldeviceorientationap  pThe W3C standard describes how the alpha attribute of this event is supposed to change when the device is rotated around its zaxis.p  pThe zaxis points towards you when holding the phone in front of you while youre looking straight at its screen. It is a normal vector of the plane coinciding with the screen.p  pIt seems to me that things work slightly  annoyingly different on my windows phone. The alpha attribute changes with rotation around the xaxis as well in portait mode, that is. p  pHow to repeat p  ol liHold up the phone in front of you in portait mode.  li liMake sure gamma is negative, meaning the phone it slightly tilted backwards. li liNow make sure that alpha is approx. zero degrees meaning the phone is centered on its yaxis. li liTilt the phone slightly to the left, make alpha approx 30 degrees, while making sure gamma stays negative.  li liNow turn the phone slightly towards you making gamma positiveli ol  pNotice how, the moment gamma becomes positive, the alpha value jumps 180 degrees. This is not described in the W3C standard, or did I miss somethingp  pp  pAnother strange thing happens when you go to landscape mode. When tilting the phone around its zaxis in landscape mode, not the alpha attribute, but the beta attribute seems to change To make the alpha attribute change in landcape mode, you have to turn the phone around its original xaxis, which, for instance, means turning the top of the phone which is now on the left side, as you are in landscape mode away from you. p  pp  pI dont have an android or iOS device at my disposal at this time, but at least the emulator in the Chrome desktop browser behaves completely different and in agreement with the W3C standard, it seems. p  pp  pI put a simple test script herep  pa hrefhttplocaboa.comwpdotest.html relnofollowhttplocaboa.comwpdotest.htmlap  popen it on your smartphonep  pp  pAm I doing something wrong  missing something p  pAny ideas as how to correct thisp  pp  pedit just tested it on an iPhone, seems to behave the same way as the windows phone...p

Negative 5 pI am programming a raycasting engine. p  pThe starting position of a ray is given by the position of the player who is standing inside a 2Dgrid. p  pWhen casting a ray into a direction, I have to determine the grids that the ray is intersecting.p  pThe indepth description of the concept is here a hrefhttpwww.permadi.comtutorialraycastrayc7.html relnofollowhttpwww.permadi.comtutorialraycastrayc7.htmlap  pThere is a small inaccuracy which causes some trouble. I believe that the problem is caused by an incorrect calculation of the grid steps. p  pHowever I lack the mathematical understanding to fix that problem.p  pProblem descriptionp  pWhen the ray is heading to the left, the grid intersection step size is slightly different than the step size when its heading to the right. p  pWhy do I even care about this Its causing the problem that some horizontal grid intersections are further away from the player than vertical grid intersections when vertical and horizontal intersections are close to each other, specifically in corners. Since I am using different textures for vertical intersections, the look of horizontal walls are ruined, because a vertical texture is used on small parts of the wall, even though its an horizontal wall.p  pIs this problem caused by a flaw in my algorithm This is how I calculate the first horizontal grid intersection and the grid stepsizep  pFind first grid intersectionp  precodeif currentangle gt 180      firstgridhorizontaly  intp.posy  Fieldwidth  Fieldwidth  Fieldwidth  else      firstgridhorizontaly  intp.posy  Fieldwidth  Fieldwidth  1  firstgridhorizontalx  p.posx  p.posy  firstgridhorizontaly  tan 180  currentangle codepre  pCalculate the step sizep  precodeif currentangle gt 180      gridstepsizehorizontaly  Fieldwidth     gridstepsizehorizontalx  Fieldwidth  tancurrentangle  180  else      gridstepsizehorizontaly  Fieldwidth     gridstepsizehorizontalx  Fieldwidth  tan180  currentangle  codepre  pAs you can see I am always using 180  current angle to determine the direction of the xvalue.

Negative 5 pIn a chroot based on CentOS 6.4 Im working in, linking against ncurses with ld 2.20 succeeds, but linking with ld 2.24 fails. I dont directly invoke the linker, gcc is handling it  gcc 4.4.7 is using ld 2.20, and gcc 4.8.2 is using ld 2.24.p  pHere is a minimal example that fails to link with gcc 4.8.2  ld 2.24 in my particular environment.p  precodeinclude ltncurses.hgt include ltstdio.hgt include ltstdlib.hgt  int main      WINDOW window  NULL      if window  initscr          printfError initializing ncurses.         exit1           halfdelay50     getch     endwin  codepre  pstrongSuccess ld 2.20strongp  pcode gcc main.c lncurses Wl,verbose  grep ncurses.succeeded attempt to open usrlibgccx8664redhatlinux4.4.7........lib64libncurses.so succeeded codep  pstrongFailure ld 2.24strongp  pcode optgcc4.8.2bingcc48 main.c lncurses Wl,verbose  grep ncurses.succeeded attempt to open usrlib..lib64libncurses.so succeeded optbinutils2.24binld24 tmpccCxUFxl.o undefined reference to symbol halfdelay lib64libtinfo.so.5 error adding symbols DSO missing from command line collect2 error ld returned 1 exit status codep  pNote that both commands appear to link against the same libncurses.so.p  pFor what its worth, in a different chroot based on CentOS 5.4, there is a different libncurses version, and it links fine with ld 2.24, but unfortunately, building in that chroot is not an option. The nm utility shows that the static libncurses.a here does have the required symbols nm lists no symbols for libncurses.so  so Im just assuming they are similar.p  pIn the CentOS 6.4 chroot, however, nm shows that all of the ncurses symbols Im getting undefined reference messages for are indeed undefined or not present in libncurses.a in the Centos 6.4 chroot, which is confusing, because linking with gcc 4.4.7 works. Something is not right.p  pAlso, I tried producing an object with gcc 4.4.7, and then linking with gcc 4.8.2, but that did not help.p  pIm confused as to why the one compiler  linker would succeed while the other would fail. Is this an ABI issue Does anyone know what is happening here Are there any flags I can pass to gcc to make the new linker workp

Negative 5 pI have a PHPMySQL website website 1 that has a login system that only asks for a PIN code just a long numeric string. A user has 2 ways of login in with this codep  ol liGoing to the website 1 login page and enter the code in a typical login form li liClicking in website 2 on a link that carries his PIN code as a GET value. The link has the format a hrefhttpmyURL.comlogin.phppin123456789 relnofollowhttpmyURL.comlogin.phppin123456789a. That just calls a function that receives the PIN as a parameter and processes the login. strongWebsite 2 is located in a different domainserver than website 1strong.li ol  pUntil here everything works fine.p  pNow comes the question. I would like to know if when using the second method described above, if its possible to only allow the login assuming the PIN is correct strongONLY if that link has been clicked in a specific websitestrong.p  pThe way it works now, anyone with the link could use it to login into website 1. I want to prevent that, I want to allow that to happen if that link has been clicked win website 2.p  pThe idea would be to detect the referring website in the login function, and only allow it if it matches the URL or any other unique identifier of website 2. p  pIf using a plain link would not allow for this that wouldnt be a problem, Im flexible as to what way I could use for this, but in the end it would need to be something that only meant a click for the users in website 2.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pI think its good to add this since some of the commentsresponses talk about the security of doing this which is great of course. The main reason to do this is to force the users to visit website 2 before going to website 1. Basically so they cant enter that URL in their browser and log into website 1, I want to only be able to use that link if theyre clicking it from website 2. I explain this because security is not a huge factor here, if a few savy users can get around whatever method I implement its not a big deal, its more important that the method is as simple as possible to implement in website 2 since I dont run that website and I will need to ask people there to do whatever is needed.p

Negative 5 pI have an application in this particular case Microsoft Lync which stays either minimized or in the background, until I notice the flashing taskbar icon and activate it deliberately. Together with greatly appreciating that it is not forced on top, like other chat app.s I used in the past, this time I tend not to notice the flashing icon and miss important chat requests, infuriating people  p  pIs there a way to programatically determine the status of an icon on taskbar and when it changes state, make a separate dialog window popup  Right now, the only notification Lync gives is a sound but considering I am in a open office environment and my laptop sound is either muted or constantly directed to a headphone, which is most of the time out of my ears. I much prefer a visual notification but am unable to find it in Lync settings. p  pAlso, if there is a possibility to accomplish that, Id like to use it for things other than just Lync. So, a general answer is much more appreciated. But, in the immediate future, Ill settle for something specific to Lync only.p

Following code with codegdbcode will explain my question in detailp  precodeanilanilInspironN5010Desktop gcc g code.c anilanilInspironN5010Desktop gdb q .a.out Reading symbols from .a.out...done. gdb list 1   include ltstdio.hgt 2    3   int mainint argc, char argv[] 4    5       int i 6       for i 0 iltargc i 7           printf pn, argv[i] 8       return 0 9    gdb break 8 Breakpoint 1 at 0x40057a file code.c, line 8. gdb run perl e print xddxccxbbxaa perl e print xccxddxeexff Starting program homeanilDesktopa.out perl e print xddxccxbbxaa perl e print xccxddxeexff 0x7fffffffe35d 0x7fffffffe376 0x7fffffffe37b  Breakpoint 1, main argc3, argv0x7fffffffdfe8 at code.c8 8       return 0 gdb x2x argv[1] 0x7fffffffe376 0xaabbccdd  0xeeddcc00 codepre  pIn above shown lines I have used codegdbcode to debug the program. As command line arguments, I have passed two hexadecimal arguments excluding the name of the program itself codexddxccxbbxaacode and codexccxddxeexffcode. Owing to the littleendian architecture, those arguments should be interpreted as code0xaabbccddcode and code0xffeeddcccode but as you can see the last line of above shown debugging shows code0xaabbccddcode and code0xeeddcc00code. Why is this so What am I missing  This has happened with some other arguments too. I am requesting you to help me with this.p  pPS 232  4294967296 and code0xffeeddcccode  4293844428 232  code0xffeeddcccode. I dont know if still there is any connection.p
Negative 5 pA product Im working on uses a hrefhttpwww.pjsip.org relnofollowpjsip and friendsa to do some VOIP calls between machines.

Negative 5 pIm starting to get stumped on this. Im developing a C.NET Web API service and frontend application to use it.

It starts on a login page, which sends a request to my Token URI with a username, password, and grant type. This is successful and the return is the token. The page changes to home and a test ajax call is sent to apivalues to grab value.

I tried to create a symlink uploads in the public directory before I packaged the app as a war file to homeusernameuploads permissions are set to 777 directory but that doesnt work I get a 500 error.p  pAlso how can I access the production.log after I deployed the war file Or where should I place the logsp  pstrongUPDATEstrong I figured out how to config Carrierwave to store uploads outside the war filep  precodeif Rails.env.development     CarrierWave.configure do config       config.root  UsersUsernameusernameuploadsuploads     end elsif Rails.env.production     CarrierWave.configure do config       config.root  homeusernameusernameuploadsuploads     end end codepre  pNow Carrierwave uploads the files without a problem, but I get a 404 error when I try to view them. I tried to include a symlink inside the war file to the uploads folder but no success. I tried to create it before running warble war, and also after the app was deployed to Tomcat  inside the appname folder .p  pAny idea how to solve thisp  pstrongUPDATE 2strong I found a working solution here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions315093configuresymlinksforsingledirectoryintomcatConfigure Symlinks for single directory in Tomcatap  pIn short cd into the exploded war directory  you can find this under tomcatwebapps  that tomcat created  if the name of the uploaded war file is yourapp.war then the directory name will be yourapp in Tomcat 8 .  Create an uploads folder with codesudo mkdir uploadscode Create a mount point codesudo mount bind pathtoactualuploaddirectoryuploads uploadscodep  pI havent yet tested this with Wildfly, but I will later today or tomorrow. If I remember correctly it wont automatically explode war files by default.p  pstrongI would still like to know additional, simpler, different solutions for the problem though, and also opinions about the solution I found.strongp

Negative 5 pI am trying to figure out an issue I am seeing when using Spring Web MVC v4.1.4. The issue seems to be around the use of the XForwardedPort header. Everything works fine when testing locally, but when deploying to a real target environment a request to our service errors out with a NumberFormatException.p  pThis is tracked down to a change in 4.1 line 136 at a hrefhttpgrepcode.comfilerepo1.maven.orgmaven2org.springframeworkspringwebmvc4.1.4.RELEASEorgspringframeworkwebservletsupportServletUriComponentsBuilder.javaavf relnofollowgrepcode.com sourcea which parses the port from XForwardedPort without any checking of format. In 4.0, the port was only parsed off of XForwardedHost.p  pThe cause is that XForwardedPort is getting built up as a list comma separated ports much like I have seen listed for XForwardedFor. I am trying to figure out if this is standard and Spring should be checking for that possibility, or if this is something we will need to handle outside of Spring long term.p  pIn looking at the a hrefhttptools.ietf.orghtmlrfc7239page7 relnofollowRFCa, there is no mention of XForwardedPort, and that all extensions should be submitted for review. Is this port list a valid behavior which I should file a defect with Spring and possibly submit the fix for, or is this a nonstandard case which we should look to solve long term in our environment to work with Spring 4.1.xp
Negative 5 pIm working on fixing a site that has been built by someone other than me. I am required to fix the menu scroll in mobile view. So far all I really know is that if you resize the browser then you are suddenly able to scroll, but if you are using a mobile then this is not the case.

Negative 5 pI have two Django Models X and Y that both have a type field, and Y is a ForeignKey for X.  When displaying the list rows of X, Django automatically shows me a choice box for Y, including all possible instances of Y.  However, I want to limit the ForeignKey choices to those that have the type set the same as the current object.p  pI have looked at plenty of related questions on this, and have learned that one way of accomplishing this is to override the codeformfieldforforeignkeycode method of codeModelAdmincode, and because I need to know the type of the current object, I also need to override codegetformcode and add a reference to the current object to the request.p  pThis works when editing the form for an individual instance, but does NOT work when loading the admins tablebased view for all instances of the Model.  Apparently it calls codeformfieldforforeignkeycode, but not codegetformcode, so the object reference that Im looking for doesnt exist.  Any thoughts on how to make this workp

However, there is no difference between the first codelscode command and the second codelscode command. I am not entirely sure what I am doing wrong. Perhaps I am using the wrong Ssh type. I have provided the code and the output I am getting. I have also added the output that I expect.p  precodeusing Tamir.SharpSsh  namespace SSHNetExample      class Program              static void Mainstring[] args                      SshExec ssh  null             try                              Console.WriteConnecting...                 ssh  new SshExechost, username, password                  ssh.Connect                  Console.WriteLineOK 01, ssh.Cipher, ssh.Mac                 Console.WriteLineServer version0, Client version1, ssh.ServerVersion, ssh.ClientVersion                 Console.WriteLineUse the exit command to disconnect.

Negative 5 pI am checking out the PromisesA Specification, but could not understand the following thingsp  pOn Section 1. Terminology,p  p1.1. codepromisecode is an object or function with a then method whose behavior conforms to this specification.p  p1.2. codethenablecode is an object or function that defines a then method.p  pSo What is the difference between the terms codethenablecode and codepromisecodep  pAlso in Section 2.3. The Promise Resolution Procedure,p  pThe promise resolution procedure is an abstract operation taking as input a promise and a value, which we denote as code[[Resolve]]promise, xcode.p  pSo my question isp  pWhy is it denoted within 2 opening and closing brackets Is there any conventionp  pThank you very much.p
Negative 5 pIm very new to Cython, and know the basics of CC compilation.p  pHeres what Im trying to dop  pThere is a decently large library written in C that I want to incorporate in my Python program. In particular, its the implementation of board logic for GNUGo. Im experimenting with building AIs for it. I need this routine to be fast, and using a Python implementation of the logic has been too slow.p  pThe Cython documentation says that I should create a code.pxdcode file that lists method signatures that are defined extern from the code.hcode files. I should then create a wrapper class in the corresponding code.pyxcode file, and manually create Pythonside function calls that hook into the method signatures listed above.p  pThe issue I have is that the library I want to implement isnt a single C file like the documentation example. It uses multiple C files, with their own interdependencies, and the game board is represented as a set of global variables that are defined extern all over the place. I really, really dont want to write code.pxdcodes for all the required C files. p  pThe GNUGo documentation suggests that I can create a codelibboard.acode file  is this conceptually different from a code.ocode file, and is there a way to include this file into Cython I ideally want to treat it as a blackbox that lets me do a method call, have the library deal with its crazy global variable nuttiness, and return the desired output.p

Negative 5 pI created branch from my working copy. In it I renamed the file using codesvn renamecode and made some modifications to it.

Negative 5 pMaybe i explain what should be achieved first  maybe the attempted solution is wrong p  pWe have some Maven Projects that are assembled into a final war file. We use Maven profiles to define the actual Variables required for different environments such as local, staging, demo, production etc...p  pFor the Projects we are using Gitflow to manage releases. This leads to the problem that version changes done on a release or hotfix branch are always merged back to the pom of the developbranch. Excluding the pom obviously is no solution, other changes are supposed to be mergedp  pSo we want to pass the information about which version of which project should be used when invoking the build. From a logical point of view this seems to be the most accurate position for this purpose.p  pEven if it is not recommended to set versions in the pom a variable, it seems to do exactly what we need. p  pFor example, building the project with codemvn Dplugin11.0.0.0 Dplugin21.3.4.5 clean installcode will build the whole Project perfectly fine. For the devenvironment it should always refer the latest version, which is called dev in our case. p  pSo we made a Run configuration for the arguments codemvn Dplugin1dev Dplugin2dev clean installcode.p  h3The actual problemh3  pHow can we advice Eclipse to use emourem RunConfiguration when doing an automatic mavenbuildp  ul liIf I select Run Configuration  dev it builds as expected. li liIf I just clean the project and let it autobuild, eclipse builds without args, leading to a corrupt project, cause now all the versions are null.li ul

Negative 5 pSo I know you might say, this is not a good question and a simple search can give me my answer, but it is not true. I have read a lot about testing and its importance. I know writing test cases helps to find the potential errors while programming. Also when you read the books they all are just repeating the same abstract definition. But after writing a lot of test cases, I came to this conclusion that it is not that much helpful neither preventing the potential errors nor increasing the product quality. p  pSo just imagine we have a test case as below over a bunch of our functionsp  precodeAssert.IsTruedivideNumbers4,3  1 Assert.IsTruedivideNumbers4,2  2 Assert.AreEqualdivideNumbers8, 4, 2 Assert.Thatdivide10,2, Eq5 codepre  pSo, while writing a test case, normally we are trying to assert the truthfulness of a bunch of very basic issues like Are two equations true Is the result of this function equal to a desired result Are they equal Does it fail Is an object an instance of a specified class,.......p  pI have worked in a lot of software development teams. Almost in all the times and in all the teams, after writing some test cases we encounter a situation where we see the functions of strongAssert Classstrong cant help us since they are very basic while the errors normally raises in a specific situations that are not a matter of being true, being equal, not being null,.... p  pSo, why do really write test cases Why we really need them and how they can help us increasing the product quality and decreasing the potential errors p

Basically I want the user to select files, and once selected, it will start uploading. I tried setting codeautoUploadcode to codefalsecode and do all the validation and error handling manually in codefileuploadaddcode, but the problem is it throws all kinds of errors when I do a codedata.files.spliceindex, 1code. Im guessing its because the array pointer gets messed up and the script is written to handle that. I also tried firing codedata.submitcode manually everytime an image is selected, which was pretty dumb of me because then codedata.submitcode gets fired as many times as there are images selected.p

Negative 5 pI come from a database background but am learning C. A lot of examples I see especially when it comes to data collection talk about creating objects with properties. For example, entering a new employee you would create an instance of the employee class and set its properties such as name, title, salary etc. This data would then be persisted in the back end database as a new records.p  pIm wondering what the advantage of this is over, lets say, a data form that displays the fields to match DB columns, includes validation and logic checks to conform with business rules.p  pIs there a rule or a best practice as to when one is better than the other Ultimately the data will be sent to the database be it via collecting form values or object properties.p

Negative 5 pWe have clickdimensions installed in a 2015 CRM version. This environment previously used Exact Target for email marketing automation.

This actually may be the problemp  precodedocument.readyfunction    var myPlaylist  new jPlayerPlaylist     jPlayer jplayerN,     cssSelectorAncestor jpcontainerN   , [                      title,             artist,             mp3,             oga,             poster               ],      playlistOptions        enableRemoveControls true,       autoPlay false     ,     swfPath jsjPlayer,     supplied webmv, ogv, m4v, oga, mp3,     smoothPlayBar true,     keyEnabled true,     audioFullScreen false      codepre  pObviously, the above code is setting up a jPlayer with a blank playlist, waiting for users to add something to it.p  pSo, to sum it all up, we wanted to store playlist items when a user adds a new song to the playlist. Weve accomplished that yay. p  pNow wed like to recall that stored information from localStorage, stored under key name localPlaylist, and repopulate the playlist when a user reloads a page on our website.p  pCan anyone please help us out Thanks so much in advancep

Negative 5 pI have xillinux OS based on ubunutu 12.04.LTS installed on my hardware ZYNQ FPGA Board. I have done some hardware reconfiguration and I need to rebuild my kernel after editing the config3.12.0xillinux1.3 file. My question is how do I rebuild the existing kernel on the hardware after making changes to the config filep  pa hrefhttpwww.wiki.xilinx.comUartliteDriver relnofollowhttpwww.wiki.xilinx.comUartliteDriverap  pThis is the page above that I am referring to where they say thatp  pTo enable the uartlite driver in the linux kernel you either have to integrate it or build it as kernel module .ko. You can enable it withp  precodemake menuconfig gt Device Drivers gt Character devices gt Serial drivers gt Xilinx uartlite serial port support codepre  pmake menuconfig  I have to enter this command on the OS running on my hardware in the rootboot.config folder  to enable it p  pWhat does ,  Device Drivers  Character devices  Serial drivers  Xilinx uartlite serial port support THIS MEAN  I have to change directory p  pThe other option as per the link posted above is to add certain lines as below to the config file, for which I would use the nano editor and then save it with ctrlX and then Y.p  precode integrate into the kernel CONFIGSERIALUARTLITEy  build as loadable module CONFIGSERIALUARTLITEm codepre  pBut they say that, After that you of course have to rebuild the kernel and deploy it to your Zynq device.p  pWhere zynq is the hardware I am running my OS on. What commands do I have to use to rebuild the existing kernel on my hardware after making changes to the .config file p  pSo, after rebuilding the kernel with the changes above, I just reboot to observer the changes p  pEDITp  pI was referring to this link, a hrefhttpwww.thegeekstuff.com201306...linuxkernel relnofollowhttpwww.thegeekstuff.com201306...linuxkernelap  pSo, in order to compile the exisiting kernel on the hadrware and build it, I edit the .config file using nano in boot folder and save it. Then, I type make in the same folder as config. Then, I type make modules in the same folder Then I type make modulesinstall Then I type make install Then I reboot the system to see the new kernel installed. Is this the right way of doing it p  pIs this how you recompiled and rebuilt it p  pCurrently in my boot directory, there are 4 files. One config file and 3 .dts files. After rebuilding the kernel, this might change p
