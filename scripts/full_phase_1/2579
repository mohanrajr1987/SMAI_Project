Positive 2579 pI want to implement a feature for Textbox Autocomplete. Currently I using jQuery Autocomplete but I am unable to implement a functionality which is related to search delay For example if I search for New , I will have an autocomplete list having [ New York,New South Memphis .....] Now, if I press S and immediately hit down arrow then I end up with selecting the first item ie New York rather than getting results for cities starting with New S. [A Web service call of search cities starting with New S gets triggered] What I want to achieve is to block the down arrow till the results are retrieved. If anyone can explain what I should focus to achieve this feature or is it not possible due to asynchronous nature of the Web Service call   p  pdiv classsnippet datalangjs datahidefalse div classsnippetcode pre classsnippetcodejs langjs prettyprintoverridecodedocument.readyfunction       locations.keydownfunction           var keyword  locations.val         var url  httpautocomplete.wunderground.comaqformatjsonampcbmyCallbackFnampquery  keyword         .ajax             type GET,             url url,             async true,             dataType jsonp,             error functione                  console.loge.message                                 var myCallbackFn  functiondata      var cities  []     for i  0 i lt data.RESULTS.length i          if data.RESULTS[i].type  city              cities.pushdata.RESULTS[i].name                    locations.autocomplete         source cities     .autocompletewidget.addClassfixedheight codepre pre classsnippetcodehtml langhtml prettyprintoverridecodelthtmlgt ltheadgt ltlink relstylesheet hrefhttpajax.googleapis.comajaxlibsjqueryui1.11.1themesuidarknessjqueryui.min.cssgt ltscript srchttpajax.googleapis.comajaxlibsjquery1.7.1jquery.min.jsgtltscriptgt ltscript srchttpcode.jquery.comui1.10.2jqueryui.js gtltscriptgt ltscript typetextjavascript srccustom.jsgtltscriptgt  ltstylegt .fixedheight  padding 1px maxheight 200px overflow auto  ltstylegt ltheadgt ltbodygt ltdiv classuiwidgetgt ltlabel fortagsgtAutocomplete ltlabelgt ltinput idlocations typetext size50gt        ltdivgt       ltbodygt lthtmlgtcodepre div div p

Positive 2579 pIm developing some multiuser application. In this application multiple users can access and edit data. For the frontand webapp I use AngularJS.p  pI am facing some architectural problem.p  pLets say, there is some data1. This data1 should be accessible for many users view only, but only one user should have the possibility to edit this data1.p  pIf the data1 is marked as inEdit, the other users can only view the last saved version of the data1.p  pNow, I am not quite sure, how to implement this feature.p  pAs for me, there are two ways of doing that.p  pstrongFIRSTstrong Save the object state in the DBp  pstrongSECONDstrong Save the object state in a global servicep  pMy problem is, I dont know, which way is the better one.p  pIf I choose the strongFIRSTstrong approach, I will have following approximate events orderp  ol lipUser gets the list with data loaded from the DB. 1 requestpli lipWhen double clicking on some data set, there will be a request to DB, which will provide data of the data set and its state inEdit or nothing. 1 requestpli lipWhen the user chooses edit on the data set  request to the DB to check if the object is still not in the inEdit state. If it is so  save new state of the object set inEdit and then allow the user to edit the object. If the object is in edit state  notify the user. 1 requestpli lipUser edited data and then clicks save  request to the DB  save new data, and reset objects inEdit state. 1 requestpli ol  p4 DB requestsp  pThe strongSECONDstrong approach has the following orderp  ol lipDB request to get the list of items. 1 requestpli lipDouble click  open data set  request object details from the DB and check for entries in the global service. 1 requestpli lipClicking edit   check for the state in the global service.pli lipWrite the object type and id in the global service if opened for edit.pli lipSaving edits  write edits in the DB and delete the service entry 1 requestpli ol  p3 requests  servicep  pI thing the idea with the service, isnt that good, because if You consider there will be a lot of objects opened and there will be a lot of such objects when the application grows, the service will have to store all the states. And that isnt good for the servers RAM, which will also have to store other data.p  pSo, what would You recommendp  pP.S.

Positive 2579 pIve worked on a webservice using Javas JAXWS and Apaches CXF. Deploying was done with Tomcat 8. So my problem is like this, my webservice class contains some code that initializes certain things for my service and I want that done ASAP, so Ive set that up in a nice method annotated with PostConstruct. I also have a Resource WebServiceContext.p  pSo the problem is as following. I have a method retrieving properties, getting them from the webservices MessageContext. The problem is that at the time PostConstruct kicks in, the MessageContext is still null, which obviously leads to a NullPointerException.p  pAs a temporary solution I have every method exposed by the WS calling my init method if it still wasnt called by anyone else. Not that pleasant. Any tips for working around this p

Id like to remove to clean up the code some. p  pIt is used only internally and I can verify the only methods being used. The problem is that I cant update the client wsdl at the moment. So if I remove the calls from the web service but the clients wsdl isnt updated does that cause problems p  pKeep in mind I am completely positive these methods arent used as its all internal and we control the programs that use the web service. We can update the wsdl for the clients the next time these programs are updated but that will likely be next year.p

Do I need to somehow put these as soap headers Or am I thinking about it all wrong, and I need to do some kind of authentication before I even call the method from what I read, Im supposed to get a token back which I then use for all future method calls  I think I see an example of this in Answer 2 of a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions24492352thebindingtousetocommunicatetothefederationserviceaturlisnotspecifThe binding to use to communicate to the federation service at url is not specifieda. a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comoeRGE.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comoeRGE.png altenter image description hereap  pNote  some other programmers Ive talked to have spent time trying to get this to work, but gave up and instead implemented a proxy in .net.

Positive 2579 pI am stuck in a scenario wondering about the best practice that can be applied for that. I am working on an Ecommerce website dealing in orders, shipments, invoices etc. p  pApart from UI creation in my application i also have the ability to sendreceive data from different suppliersthrough supplier apis xmljson. The application can post ordersshipments to a supplier created in my application or get all ordersshipments from a supplier to import in my app. The scenario varies from supplier to supplier.p  pMy question is what would be the best approach to handle this. Below are the two approaches i have thought of. I am using the first approach right now but i am thinking whether its the right one to be used in this case.p  pstrong1. I have created a generic code to generate JSONXML based on XPATH. For example for below XML generation i use the XPATH as Orders.order.orderNumber codeltOrdersgtltordergtltorderNumbergttestorderltorderNumbergtltordergtltOrdersgtcode The XPATH is stored in database and based on the different configured XPATH in database, complete JSONXML is generated and sent to the supplierGETPOST is also configured in database.strongp  pThe advantage i think of this approach is minimal work to add new suppliers into the system. The disadvantage i think it has is the XMLJSON generation which goes through big loops. As the APIs to be called for suppliersOrders GET etc are mostly fixed, this appears to be a disdvantage.p  pstrong2. I create separate services to handle each supplier calls, create methods that handle each call with XML hardcoded into the applicationWithout configuration in DB through XPATH. For ex, for 2 suppliers SuppA and SuppB. For SuppA orders list is to be downloaded and for SuppB shipments are to be posted. So there will be 2 services in my application handling each supplier calls independent of one another, 1 for SuppA and another for SuppB. SuppA service will call the orders GET api and SuppB service will call Shipments POST api.strong p  pThe advantage of this i think is that it would be fast as XMLJSON generation would not be needed as only the required calls will be coded in the service codes for each supplier. The disadvantage i think it has is that only fixed services can be called. I the first approach anything could be changed through DB, but in this code needs to be changed.p  pPlease suggest on this. Which approach is best for this scenario, the Generic DB configuration or the hardcoded separate supplier servicesp

However, if I try to directly drag the batch file into the command window and execute it, the first command starts and ends up failing to succesfully execute.

Negative 2579 pI have a class that is wrapped with swig, and registered with lua. I can create an instance of this class in a lua script, and it all works fine.p  pBut say I have an instance of a class made in my c code with a call to new X, and I have la luastate L with a function in it that I want to call, which accepts one argument, an instance of X... How do I call that function. Here is some of the code in question Ive omitted the error handling stuffp  pmain.cppp  precodeclass GuiInst extern C      int luaopenengine luaState L   int main      GuiInst guinew GuiInst     luaState LluaLnewstate     luaopenengineL this is swigs module     int errorluaLloadfileL,mainmenu.lua     luapcallL, 0, 0, 0     luagetglobalL,Init     Somehow push gui onto lua stack...     luapcallL, 1, 0, 0     luacloseL  codepre  pmainmenu.luap  precodefunction Initgui     vregionguiCreateComponentGuiRegionVertical end codepre  pAt the moment all I have found that can work is to expose some functionality from the swig generated cpp file, and call that. This is bad for a few reasons... It wont work if I have multiple modulles and I had to change the default linkage specification in the swig file using DSWIGRUNTIME.p  pI add the following to main.cppp  precodeextern C      struct swigmoduleinfo     struct swigtypeinfo     int luaopenengine luaState L     swigmoduleinfo SWIGLuaGetModuleluaState L     void SWIGLuaNewPointerObjluaState L,void ptr,swigtypeinfo type, int own     swigtypeinfo SWIGTypeQueryModuleswigmoduleinfo start,swigmoduleinfo end,const char name  and then to push the value... SWIGLuaNewPointerObjL,gui,SWIGTypeQueryModuleSWIGLuaGetModuleL,SWIGLuaGetModuleL,GuiInst ,0 codepre  pThat gets a pointer to the module, then a pointer to the type, then calls swigs function to register it. It was an unreasonable thing to have to dig into a file thats not supposed to be human readable so it says at the top of the file and is just MESSY but it does workp  pSurely theres a better way to accomplish what Im trying to do.p  pPS from a high level pov what I want is to have lua not refcount the Gui components which are created by the Object Factory in GuiInst, in case Im going about this wrong. This is my first time exposing functionality to a scripting language apart from some very simple and nonswig python modules, so Im prepared to take advice.p  pThanks for any advicep  hr  pResponse to comment by RBerteigp  pGuiInsts contructor is defined to private when swig runs to prevent lua constructing instances of it, so that wont work for me. What I was trying to prevent was the following in luap  precoderengine.GuiRegionVertical rAddengine.GuiButton codepre  pwhich would call gnew GuiButton then register it with the GuiRegionVertical which needs to store a pointer for various reasons, then call delete g, and the GuiRegionVertical is left with a dangling pointer to g.p  pI suspect what really needs to happen is that GuiRegionVerticalAddGuiButton should increment the ref count of the GuiButton, and then GuiRegionVerticals destructor should decrement the refcounts of all of its contents, though im not sure how this should be done with swig.p  pThat would remove the need for the private constructors, the Gui Object Factory and the nasty externs.p  pAm I going about this Wrongp  pThanks.p

Negative 2579 pI am in charge of a program that is used to create a set of nodes and paths for consumption by an autonomous ground vehicle.  The program keeps track of the locations of all items in its map by indicating the items position as being x meters north and y meters east of an origin point of 0,0.  In the real world, the vehicle knows the location of the origins lat and long, as it is determined by a dgps system and is accurate down to a couple centimeters.  My program is ignorant of any lat long coordinates.p  pIt is one of my goals to modify the program to keep track of lat long coords of items in addition to an origin point and items x,y position in relation to that origin.  At first blush, it seems that I am going to modify the program to allow the lat long coords of the origin to be passed in, and after that I desire that the program will automatically calculate the lat long of every item currently in a map.  From what Ive researched so far, I believe that I will need to figure out the math behind converting to lat long coords from a UTM like projection where I specify the origin points and meridians etc as opposed to whatever is defined already for UTM.p  pIve come to ask of you GIS programmers, am I on the right track  It seems to me like there is so much to wrap ones head around, and Im not sure if the answer isnt something as simple as, oh yea theres a conversion from meters to lat long, herep  pCurrently, due to the nature of DGPS, the system really doesnt need to care about locations more than oh, what... 40 km radius away from the origin.  Given this, and the fact that I need to make sure that the error on my coordinates is not greater than .5 meters, do I need anything more complex than a simple latlong to meters conversion constantp  pIm knee deep in materials here.  I could use some pointers about what concepts to research.p  pThanks muchp

Negative 2579 pIm developing an iPhone app using Core Data and Im looking for some general advice and recommendations on whether its acceptable to pass data between ViewControllers versus doing a local fetch in each ViewController as you navigate to it. Ordinarily I would say it all depends on various factors e.g. performance etc but the passing data approach is so prevalent in my app and Im spooked by all the stories about Apple rejecting apps because of not conforming to their standard guidelines. p  pSo let me put another way  is it nonstandard to pass data between VCs p  pThe reason I pass data so much is because each ViewController is just another view on to data present in my object model  graph. Once I have a handle on my first object in the first view controller which I of course do have to fetch, I can use the existing object composition   relationships to drill down into the next level of detail into data and so I just pass these objects to the next VC.p  pSeparately, one possible downside with this passingdatatoeachVC approach is I dont benefit from what I perceive to be the optimisationbenefits that NSFetchedResultsController provides in terms of efficient memory usage and section handling. My app is readonly but I do have one table with 5000 rows and Im curious if I am missing out on NSFetchedResultsController benefits. Any thoughts on this as well Can I somehow still benefit from NSFetchedResultsController goodness without having to do a full fetch as I would have already passed in the data from my previous VCp  pThanks a lot.p
Negative 2579 pI have a split viewbased app that presents a masterdetail interface, and uses a popover to present the master list when in portrait mode.

If I havent scrolled past the top of the second section, it correctly remembers its scroll position when the table is presented again.p  pSimilarly, in landscape mode, if I scroll the table past the top of the third section and then rotate to portrait, when I come back to landscape the scroll position is always set such that the first row of the third section is at the top of the list.p  pI tried calling codescrollToNearestSelectedRowAtScrollPositionanimatedcode in both the master view controllers codeviewWillAppearcode, as well as in the split view delegates codesplitViewControllerpopoverControllerwillPresentViewControllercode, to no effect.

Negative 2579 pbHere is the scenariobp  pI am currently working on a legacy reporting system for a company which collects data from sensors. The database SQLServer 2005 is fairly big ca. 500 GB with hundreds of MBs being added every day. The system runs a series of nightly jobs in order to aggregate and transform the newly added data into a staging database from which the reports are issued. These jobs can take hours to complete and are written entirely in SQL, resulting in hundreds of stored procedures some being up to 3000 lines long containing tons of business logic. The system has been in ongoing development for almost three years, and has become a maintenance nightmare. p  pbMy dilemmabp  pWe would love to rewrite parts of the system most urgently the nightly jobs on a platform better suited for expressing and maintaining complex business logic aka C. The problem is that we frequently need to debug the data collection process in order to detect bugs in the system and more often than not inconsistencies in the source data. The only place where we can detect these issues is the production environment. The big advantage of the current implementation in SQL is that we can just copypaste parts of the scripts to analyze the outcome of each intermediate step. This would hardly be possible with a C solution, since we cannot install visual studio on the production environment.p  pbFinally, the questionbp  pDo you have any good suggestion of how to maintain our flexible debug capabilities on the production environment AND find a way of expressing complex business logic in a sane wayp

Negative 2579 pC certainly isnt my strong suit so I appreciate all the generous folk sharing their knowledge. Im working with a Windows Form and Ive read up on events and have found some excellent help on how to modify a TabControl so I can have an OnDraw event that will add some coloring to the tabs.p  pThe color of each tab is based upon the state of a connection variable Current green Lost red Stale yellowp  pThe OnDraw event works excellent for updating the color of each tab, but that only occurs when the user selects a different tab to view.p  pWhat I would like to happen is for the color of each tab to be updated whenever the connection state changes. For example, lets say Tab1 is colored green, but then the connection state changes to stale so now the tab needs to be colored yellow but it wont get colored like that until the user clicks on a different tab and the OnDraw event is triggered.p  pSo Im trying to figure out how to do that. When the OnDraw event is triggered normally by the user clicking on a different tab a DrawItemEventArgs parameter is passed into the even handler. That variable is already populated with the pertinent data needed to figure out which tab was clicked on, the boundaries of that tab and etc. So I am unsure where it came from or how I can programmatically recreate such a call to recolor the tabs whenever the connection variable changes.p  pPlease let me know if I need to clarify anything Thank you. p

Negative 2579 pIm relatively new to unit testing, and have become concerned by the fact that the quantity of my test code is dwarfing my production code when I have case statements where certain calls to external functions are repeated but with different arguments and subsequently different outcomes.  After my questions is some javascript pseudocode apologies if this is formatted incorrectly for a public function called calculateDeltas.  In the code below, populateDeltas is a private function that I am testing indirectly through the test for calculateDeltas.p  pThe problems Im struggling with are the followingbr 1. Im testing calculateDeltas in 4 different ways to cover the 4 different branches.br 2. In this way, Im effectively testing populateDeltas 3 times.  There are a handful of assertions for each test of populateDeltas and these tests are effectively being repeated 3 times with different arguments.br 3. One thought I had was to test populateDeltas in isolation.  In that case arent I now testing implementation and, more importantly, stronghow would I ever know the whole function calculateDeltas works if Im never testing it as one whole unitstrongbr 4. Even if this is a good idea how does that simplify my test for calculateDeltas  I presume I would just verify somehow that populateDeltas was called.br 5. In that case, how am I verifying that the output of calculateDeltas is what I actually expect in the context it was calledbr 6. In other words, how do I know calculateDeltas works without running integration tests on private functionsbr 7. Doesnt this all violate the spirit of BDD which is to guard external, as opposed, to internal behavior and populateDeltas represents internal behavior, while calculateDeltas represents external behavior  p  pThanks for any insight, Im a bit lost.

Negative 2579 pIm trying to squeeze as much out of my memory as possible. I have a matrix of code4.9999995e13code ints but they only need to be true or false  basically I only need one bit of storage for each of these ints.p  pI understand that there are no single bit types in C maybe someone can explain why, to me, and I also know that if a codeshort short intcode existed it would be 1 byte, same as char. However all of the logical operations in C return ints as well as a few other functions.p  pSo my questions arep  ul liIs there some way of making a codeshort short intcode existli liIf I was to use codecharcode instead, would I have performance decrease because of all the casting to codeintcode that would have to be doneli liIs there another way that Im missingli ul  pJust incase its relevant, I am compiling with GCC for C99.p  pThanks.p  pemEDITem Ive just seen on a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiCsyntaxPrimitivedatatypes relnofollowthis wikipedia pagea that there is a codeBoolcode type, is this actually standardp

IPacket packet  IPacket.make      whilecontainer.readNextPacketpacket gt 0                         Now we have a packet, lets see if it belongs to our audio stream                   if packet.getStreamIndex  audioStreamId                                     We allocate a set of samples with the same number of channels as the               coder tells us is in this buffer.                              We also pass in a buffer size 1024 in our example, although Xuggler               will probably allocate more space than just the 1024 its not important why.                            IAudioSamples samples  IAudioSamples.make512, audioCoder.getChannels,IAudioSamples.Format.FMTS16                              A packet can actually contain multiple sets of samples or frames of samples               in audiodecoding speak.  So, we may need to call decode audio multiple               times at different offsets in the packets data.  We capture that here.                           int offset  0                             Keep going until weve processed all data                                     whileoffset lt packet.getSize                              int bytesDecoded  audioCoder.decodeAudiosamples, packet, offset                 if bytesDecoded lt 0                     throw new RuntimeExceptiongot error decoding audio in   filename                  offset  bytesDecoded                                     Some decoder will consume data in a packet, but will not be able to construct                   a full set of samples yet.  Therefore you should always check if you                   got a complete set of samples from the decoder                                                                        if samples.isComplete                                      writer.encodeAudiostreamIndex, samples                                                   else                                     This packet isnt part of our audio stream, so we just silently drop it.                           do  whilefalse               codepre

Negative 2579 pOk, so my question is kind of convoluted, so Ill try to be as clear as possible.  Because a collection of radio buttons does not have a SelectedItemValue property, I have collected my radioButtons into a ListBox, based on some XAML I found online.  Now, in order to save space on the UI, that ListBox is taking over the content of a ComboBox popup.  So when you click the comboBox, what drops down is a list of radiobuttons in a WrapPanel.  I have been able to successfully bind the RadioButton listbox control by itself to an itemssource and bind selected value to a property, but once inside the combo box, I cannot seem to get the selected value binding to work properly, ItemsSource still works fine.p  precodeltStyle xKeyRadioButtonList TargetTypexType ListBoxgt     ltSetter PropertyBackground ValueWhitegt     ltSetter PropertyItemsPanelgt         ltSetter.Valuegt             ltItemsPanelTemplategt                 ltWrapPanel BackgroundTransparent gt             ltItemsPanelTemplategt         ltSetter.Valuegt     ltSettergt     ltSetter PropertyItemContainerStylegt         ltSetter.Valuegt             ltStyle TargetTypexType ListBoxItem gt                 ltSetter PropertyMargin Value5 gt                 ltSetter PropertyTemplategt                     ltSetter.Valuegt                         ltControlTemplate TargetTypexType ListBoxItemgt                             ltBorder BorderThickness1 BackgroundTransparentgt                                 ltRadioButton FocusableFalse Width120                                         IsHitTestVisibleFalse                                         ContentBinding Name                                         IsCheckedTemplateBinding IsSelectedgt                                 ltRadioButtongt                             ltBordergt                         ltControlTemplategt                     ltSetter.Valuegt                 ltSettergt             ltStylegt         ltSetter.Valuegt     ltSettergt     ltSetter PropertyControl.Templategt         ltSetter.Valuegt             ltControlTemplate TargetTypexType ListBoxgt                 ltBorder BorderThickness0 Padding0 BorderBrushTransparent BackgroundTransparent NameBd SnapsToDevicePixelsTruegt                     ltItemsPresenter SnapsToDevicePixelsTemplateBinding UIElement.SnapsToDevicePixels gt                 ltBordergt             ltControlTemplategt         ltSetter.Valuegt     ltSettergt ltStylegt ltStyle xKeyRadioButtonCombo TargetTypeComboBoxgt     ltSetter PropertyTemplategt         ltSetter.Valuegt             ltControlTemplate TargetTypeComboBoxgt                 ltGridgt                     ltToggleButton                              NameToggleButton                             DataContextTemplateBinding ItemsSource                             ContentBinding ElementNameDropDownContent, PathSelectedItem.Name                             Focusablefalse                             IsCheckedBinding PathIsDropDownOpen,ModeTwoWay,RelativeSourceRelativeSource TemplatedParent                             ClickModePress gt                     ltContentPresenter                             NameContentSite                             IsHitTestVisibleFalse                               ContentTemplateTemplateBinding SelectionBoxItemTemplate                             ContentTemplateSelectorTemplateBinding ItemTemplateSelector                             Margin3,3,23,3                             VerticalAlignmentCenter                             HorizontalAlignmentLeft gt                     ltPopup NamePopup PlacementBottom IsOpenTemplateBinding IsDropDownOpen                             AllowsTransparencyTrue FocusableFalse PopupAnimationSlidegt                         ltGrid NameDropDown SnapsToDevicePixelsTrue                               MinWidthTemplateBinding ActualWidth MaxHeightTemplateBinding MaxDropDownHeightgt                             ltBorder xNameDropDownBorder BackgroundWhiteSmoke                                     BorderThickness1 BorderBrushBlackgt                             ltListBox NameDropDownContent StyleStaticResource RadioButtonList                                       WidthTemplateBinding MaxWidth                                      SelectedValueBinding PathSelectedValue, RelativeSourceRelativeSource TemplatedParent                                      ItemsSourceTemplateBinding ItemsSourcegt                             ltListBoxgt                         ltGridgt                     ltPopupgt                 ltGridgt             ltControlTemplategt         ltSetter.Valuegt     ltSettergt     ltStyle.Triggersgt     ltStyle.Triggersgt ltStylegt codepre  pMy use of that looks like thisp  precode    ltComboBox NameSourceComboCtl                TextSource                SelectedValuePathCodeId                DisplayMemberPathName                SelectedValueBinding PathSourceCode               StyleStaticResource RadioButtonCombo               Width60                MaxWidth150 gt codepre

Negative 2579 pIve got a CMake project that includes and links against two libraries, say codeAcode and codeBcode actually its more than two and one of them is boost stuff, but that doesnt really matter here. Both are located via codeFindSomething.cmakecode scripts that correctly populate the standard CMake variables such that include directories are added viap  precodeINCLUDEDIRECTORIESAINCLUDEDIRS INCLUDEDIRECTORIESBINCLUDEDIRS codepre  pand linking is later done viap  precodeTARGETLINKLIBRARIESmytarget ALIBRARIES BLIBRARIES codepre  pNow, the problem is that both libraries can either reside in a user based location or in the system directories Im on linux by the way, CMake 2.8.2  or in both. Lets say codeAcode is only in codeHOMEusrincludecode and codeHOMEusrlibcode while codeBcode boost in my case resides in both the system paths codeusrincludecode and codeusrlibcode AND in the user based paths  in different versions. The find scripts can be made to find either the system or the userbased library codeBcode, this works.p  pThe trouble starts when I want to link against codeBcode from the system paths.codeBINCLUDEDIRScode and codeBLIBRARIEScode correctly point to the systemwide locations of the headers and libraries. But there is still codeAINCLUDEDIRScode that points to a nonsystem include directory and ultimately also the headers for library codeBcode are taken from this location, while the linking for codeBcode uses the version from the system paths via codeBLIBRARIEScode which leads to conflicts, i.e. linking errors.p  pChanging the order of the codeINCLUDEDIRECTORIEScode statements does not seem to change anything. I checked the origin of the symbols that cause the linking errors via codenm linenumberscode on the object files.p  pWhat can I do Is there a trick to p  ul liforce the ordering of the include directories even if this would mean to give precedence to a system path although there is also a userbased location specifiedli litell CMake to use codeAINCLUDEDIRScode for all headers from codeAcode and codeBINCLUDEDIRScode for all headers from codeBcodeli ul

Negative 2579 pIm looking for some implementation guidance.  What are the pro and cons of using the wcf bindings or using the plain vanilla .net rabbitmq api. Are the moment we are not constrained to  use either.  I new to rabbitmq, but done a bundle of wcf. p  pWe have a product which collects info from publishers on each device. The product is behind the firewall at the moment. The publisher will need 34 channels.p  ul liRequestResponse to publish the metric to publishsubscribe on server with ack from server.li liUpdate channel, to update publisher rulebase for metric discovery from server.li liHeartbeat channel to check server is up and respond to server heartbeat.li liPossible dead letter channel.li ul  pPublisher will be cross platform. Thinking of hosting on Mono, on Linux, BSD, Solaris, Android, MacOs, iOS, and possibly AixHPUX. Dont know how effective wcf endpoints would be in these instances.  p  pServer will have multiple workers, each receive same message from own queue, ack it and process it against their own rulebase.  I would like the workers to be event driven. Server needs to be high performance, 10k to 100k messages per minute.  No messages can be lost from publisher to server. p  pIm swinging towards using the plain api as it offers more flexibility as regarding stuff like threadingserializationsession managementsecuritycompression but the product may be moved to Azure and offered as SaaS or PaaS, and having wcf endpoint would make sense to talk to publishers on both onoff windows, but that would be in the longer term. p

Negative 2579 pI have various Nuget packages installed to my solution. Some in my domain project and some in my MVC Front End project.p  pThis all works quite happily. However if you get the project new from source control I can see I have all the packages in the packages folder. However they all appear to have an exclamation after them in References for the projects. p  pIf I use nuget command nuget install .ProjectFolderPackages.config it seems to install the pacakges again but the refrences still dont appear. I have to manually install them using nuget manage references and install them individually. Which is a bit of a hassle for new developers starting projects.p  pSeems a bit odd Is something wrong or is this normal Shouldnt NugetVS2010 know that all packages exist and be happy as the packages are all in the local file system from source control I know there is a debate about keeping them there but lets leave that asidep  pThanksp  pGraemep

Negative 2579 pWeve got an old legacy win32 service, developed with C, and weve just recently noticed that when the service starts up and stops, there is an informational message in the event logs about our missing event descriptions. To be more precise, the message looks like thisp  blockquote   pThe description for Event ID 0 from source [application] cannot be   found. Either the component that raises this event is not installed on   your local computer or the installation is corrupted. You can install   or repair the component on the local computer.p blockquote  pSo we understand what this means, basically were missing a library which has a message table compiled into it. This way when the event ID for changing status startstop arrives, it can look up the message and print it in the event logs.p  pThe question is, for these universal messages changing status etc which pretty much every service is going to have, surely there are default message table that we can use, rather than having to go to the trouble of creating another project, just for this, adding registries and updating our installer.p  pSeems like a lot of hassle for something that should surely be a default somewhere Like the standard win32 error messagesp  pIve created a number of managed services in the past, and Im pretty sure we didnt need to do anything like this beforep  pThanks in advanced p  pAndy.p

Negative 2579 pI am working on a performance critical system that has a lot of logging. I am planning to do my major computation in a thread that sticks to one core, and logs in another thread that sticks to another core. How do I achieve that in pthreadsetaffinitynp p  pI imagine that my code would look like p  precodevoid logsomethingconst stringamp st    pthreadsetaffinitynppthreadself,sizeofcpuset,ampcpuset   LOG string st    int main     while true         do some computation       logsomethingsomething      codepre  pMy question is, when I call pthreadsetaffinitynp in logsomething, would it do the logging in the cpu I specified, and while doing the logging, return to the while loop of main and continue the computation p  pOr it will switch the entire program to that cpu set, and will only return to main method after logging p  pThanks p  p[EDITED] I use logging as an example but my practical problem is more complicated than that. For example, I might have to update a dynamic parameter every minute, and while I am updating the parameter, I still want to continue my computation in the main method based on the old parameter i.e. I just cant stop my main computation for parameter updating. Therefore the process of updating the parameters might have to be migrated to another thread that sticks to another core. So I am looking for a generic solution of separating the computation, not just an efficient logger. p  pSorry for the confusion. p

Negative 2579 pI have a self hosted F WCF Server that is used to return cached data to our application.  The amount of data can range from a single row to tens of thousands. Because of the large differences in data, I set the values in the app.config to handle a very large data items.  Everything was working fine until a week ago when something broke and the server just stopped working.  It took me a few days to get things and I never quite figured what was wrong.

raw sockets instead  Please let me know if there is other code that you want to see, but its quite involved so I didnt want to post it all.p  pstrongUPDATEstrong Per Richard Blewett, Ill explain what Im trying to do and any guidance on the best way to configure this would be great.p  pBasically, Im moving much of our business logic to an app server since much of it right now is contained in SQL Server stored procedures, and were finding that due to the complexities of the queries, SQL is simply too slow.  By querying SQL, transforming the data using F libraries on the app server and then caching it, I find that Im able to drop times from 2060 secs per request down to less than 3 after the data is cached, although most of that is due to the latency issue described above.  I know that 3 secs might be okay in some instances, but I know that it can go faster since it was working before, and eventually we want this be deployed on a cloud solution would then would involve 1000s of users, so I want this to be able to scale well.p  pThe type of data what were returning is generally going to be less than 10 columns, with each of those generally being strings of less than 100 chars or decimals.  But the data will have lots of rows, ranging from a few hundred to tens of thousands.  The number of clients will range from just a handful to possibly 100 or more at a time although for the time being there are very few clients at this level.  The application that will be deployed on our various client sites, though will later be deployed in a cloud solution.p  pSince the data is mostly used for reporting, most of the calls are for read only data, hence the caching.  Usually a user runs a report, modifies a parameter, then runs the report again, so there will be call for a lot of data at once, then nothing for seconds or minutes.  There are some batch reporting processes though where a user will run a series of reports often hundreds in a row and therefore would be a large number of calls for data, again ranging from a few hundred rows to tens of thousands at a time.p  pI hope that this is enough to go on.  Thanks againp

Negative 2579 pI quote from The C Programming Language by Kernighan amp Ritchiep  blockquote   pAny pointer can be meaningfully compared for equality or inequality with zero. But the behavior is undefined for arithmetic or comparisons with pointers that do not point to members of the same array. There is one exception the address of the first element past the end of an array can be used in pointer arithmetic.p blockquote  pDoes this mean I cannot rely on codecode for checking equality of different pointers What are the situations in which this comparison leads to a wrong resultp

Negative 2579 pSuppose Im loading a large number of objects from a database. These are normal, plain PHP objects, no inheritance from anything fancy. Suppose I might change a few of these objects and want to write them back to the database, but only use the fields that actually differ in the UPDATE ... SET ... query. Also suppose that I dont know in advance which objects are going to be changed.p  pIm thinking that I need to make a copy of all the objects loaded, and keep around for reference and comparison, should I need to write objects back to the database.p  pI see two possible approachesp  ul liI can either clone all the loaded objects and store in a separate list. When saving, look up the object in the list using an index, and compare the values.li liOr, I can simply serialize everything loaded into a string, and keep around. When saving, find the serialized object in the string somehow, unserialize it, compare the values, and there you go.li ul  pIn terms of efficiency mostly memory, but speed is also a consideration, which would be favorablep

Please review context of original question below as may be needed.p blockquote  pMy issue is that I have a ViewModel class as the datacontext to a window.

What Ive ultimately found is that no matter what source or path I give it, it just wont cooperate.  HOWEVER, just by playing around with scenarios, I said the heck with it.  Lets look.  The Textbox control has its own DataContext property.  So, in code, I just FORCED the textbox.DataContext  MyViewModel.MyDataTableObject and left the path to just the column it should represent MyDataColumn, and it worked.p  pSo, that said, how would I write the XAML for the textbox control so its DataContext property is set to that of the datatable object of the view model the window but cant get that correct.

Negative 2579 pIm planning to rewrite a small C OpenGL font library I made a while back using FreeType 2 since I recently discovered the changes to newer OpenGL versions. My code uses immediate mode and some function calls Im pretty sure are deprecated now, e.g. glLineStipple.p  pI would very much like to support a range of OpenGL versions such that the code uses e.g. VBOs when possible or falls back on immediate mode if nothing else is available and so forth. Im not sure how to go about it though. Afaik, you cant do a compile time check since you need a valid OpenGL context created at runtime. So far, Ive come up with the following proposals with inspiration from other threadssitesp  ul lipUse GLEW to make runtime checks in the drawing functions and to check for function support e.g. glLineStipplepli lipUse some defines and other preprocessor directives that can be specified at compile time to compile different versions that work with different OpenGL versionspli lipCompile different versions supporting different OpenGL versions and supply each as a separate downloadpli lipShip the library with a script PythonPerl that checks the OpenGL version on the system if possiblereliable and does the approapriate modifications to the source so it fits with the users version of OpenGLpli lipTarget only newer OpenGL versions and drop support for anything belowpli ul  pIm probably going to use GLEW anyhow to easily load extensions.p  pstrongFOLLOWUPstrong Based on your very helpful answers, I tried to whip up a few lines based on my old code, heres a snippet no testedfinished. I declare the appropriate function pointers in the config header, then when the library is initialized, I try to get the right function pointers. If VBOs fail pointers null, I fall back to display lists deprecated in 3.0 and then finally to vertex arrays. I should maybe also check for available ARB extensions if fx. VBOs fail to load or is that too much work Would this be a solid approrach Comments are appreciated p  precodeif definedWIN32  definedWIN32  definedWIN32     define OFLWINDOWS      other stuff...     ifndef OFLUSESGLEW          Check which extensions are supported     else          Declare vertex buffer object extension function pointers         PFNGLGENBUFFERSPROC          glGenBuffers           NULL         PFNGLBINDBUFFERPROC          glBindBuffer           NULL         PFNGLBUFFERDATAPROC          glBufferData           NULL         PFNGLVERTEXATTRIBPOINTERPROC glVertexAttribPointer  NULL         PFNGLDELETEBUFFERSPROC       glDeleteBuffers        NULL         PFNGLMULTIDRAWELEMENTSPROC   glMultiDrawElements    NULL         PFNGLBUFFERSUBDATAPROC       glBufferSubData        NULL         PFNGLMAPBUFFERPROC           glMapBuffer            NULL         PFNGLUNMAPBUFFERPROC         glUnmapBuffer          NULL     endif elif someothersystem codepre  pInit functionp  precodeifdef OFLWINDOWS     bool loaded  true       Attempt to load vertex buffer obejct extensions     loaded  glGenBuffers           PFNGLGENBUFFERSPROCwglGetProcAddressglGenBuffers                    NULL ampamp loaded     loaded  glBindBuffer           PFNGLBINDBUFFERPROCwglGetProcAddressglBindBuffer                    NULL ampamp loaded     loaded  glVertexAttribPointer  PFNGLVERTEXATTRIBPOINTERPROCwglGetProcAddressglVertexAttribPointer  NULL ampamp loaded     loaded  glDeleteBuffers        PFNGLDELETEBUFFERSPROCwglGetProcAddressglDeleteBuffers              NULL ampamp loaded     loaded  glMultiDrawElements    PFNGLMULTIDRAWELEMENTSPROCwglGetProcAddressglMultiDrawElements      NULL ampamp loaded     loaded  glBufferSubData        PFNGLBUFFERSUBDATAPROCwglGetProcAddressglBufferSubData              NULL ampamp loaded     loaded  glMapBuffer            PFNGLMAPBUFFERPROCwglGetProcAddressglMapBuffer                      NULL ampamp loaded     loaded  glUnmapBuffer          PFNGLUNMAPBUFFERPROCwglGetProcAddressglUnmapBuffer                  NULL ampamp loaded       if loaded         stdcout ltlt OFL Current OpenGL context does not support vertex buffer objects ltlt stdendl     else          define OFLUSESVBOS         stdcout ltlt OFL Loaded vertex buffer object extensions successfully         return true           if glMajorVersion gt 3.f          stdcout ltlt OFL Using vertex arrays ltlt stdendl         define OFLUSESVERTEXARRAYS      else           Display lists were deprecated in 3.0 although still available through ARB extensions         stdcout ltlt OFL Using display lists         define OFLUSESDISPLAYLISTS      elif someothersystem codepre

Negative 2579 pI have a Samsung Galaxy SII which has USB host support built in, and a Motorola Droid original which also has USB host hacked in.  The SGSII runs Android 3.x and the Droid runs 2.x.  p  pI ported libusbcompat to Android mainly just crosscompiling it so that I can plug in an external device and use it, which has a driven that requires libusbcompat.  The driver was also ported to Android and links to my port of libusbcompat.  On top of all of this is an application which has a JNI interface to use the driver and libusbcompat.p  pOn the Droid running Android 2.x, all of this works perfectly.  I can initialize the device with my ported driver, and it can use libusbcompat to do its thing.p  pHowever, on the SGSII running 3.x, calls to libusbcompat to list USB devices, query them, etc. all fail.  Libusbcompat running from within my application is able to find the root USB bus, but the list of USB devices always comes up empty and queries to them fail.p  pNow, if I compile a simple standalone executable which links to libusbcompat and simply tries to list the USB devices and run it emoutsideem of my application e.g., in an adb shell, it is able to find the root bus and all of the USB devices on the SGSII.

Negative 2579 pProblem I have to connect a Lego NXT robot to an Android device via bluetooth. The NXT is running leJos, so I can use normal Java code on it. Those devices will send and receive messages from each other. Now, the Android part is clear to me, i did similar things in the past using the Message and Handler classes of Android API.p  pIs there a similar API in standard Java and how to use it I found a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq107026221509025thisa related thread, but couldnt figure out how it should work. Then I found the a hrefhttpjava.sun.comdevelopertechnicalArticlesEcommercejms relnofollowJava Message Service APIa JMS from Java EE.

Negative 2579 pIm making my first game with appMobi after creating some games for Android using Java. I basically intend to create a endless runner arcade game, 2d, top view.p  pIm using appMobi with plain JS and CSS3 without any other library such as Impact.p  pI started by doing some tests with canvas and created a very simple demo where you control a ball basically a circle rendered using canvas with the accelerometer and need to collect other balls. Ive tested it with my Galaxy S2, and an iPhone 4 and it looked like the iPhone ran it much better, so I started writing a simple engine to use dom elements instead. I basically created an object that connects to a  tag, and holds a position vector, also added a draw function that basically does the following this.element.style.leftxpx and the same for top and y.p  pOn my main loop ive called the draw function on the objects and updated their location according to my game logic, and recalled the mainLoop using this window.requestAnimationFrame wrapperp  precodewindow.requestAnimFrame  function        return  window.requestAnimationFrame                       window.webkitRequestAnimationFrame                 window.mozRequestAnimationFrame                    window.oRequestAnimationFrame                      window.msRequestAnimationFrame                     function callback                  window.setTimeoutcallback, 1000  60                     codepre  pThen I moved on to creating a camera object to control screen positioning and made it successfully scroll the background using css backgroundposition property. Ive tested it with my new Galaxy s3 and with a s2 with some graphics on 2 200x200 pngs, and a background and everything ran smooth at 60 fps. I was very pleased with the results and really got excited to test on an iPhone 4 iOS 4.x , but to my disappointment it ran at 23 FPS  30 times slower than my android. I started making a lot of changes currently Im using a viewport of 720x1280 so Ive tried using 320480, using canvas instead, removing scrolling background, resizing images, but to no avail, while the android performed well on all variations.p  pBest I got was 5 FPS. I got another iPhone to test, an iPhone 4S with iOS5 and got very very unstable FPS. ranged from 3  50 but was unplayable  no chances anyone would play it, and Ive not even started to pack it with content.p  pI really want to take advantage of crossplatforming and it would be a shame for me to give up on the Apple market, so any tips or advise will be warmly receivedp  pThanks, Gabrielp
Negative 2579 pIve spent the last six hours pouring over documents from Google and I still dont know how to get started with this. All I want to do is make it so my existing Android app can read files from Google Drive, upload new files to Google Drive, and edit existing files on Google Drive.p  pIve read that Drive SDK v2 was focused solely on making it easy for Android and mobile in general developers to use it, and yet there seems to be virtually nothing in their documentation about it.p  pIdeally, Id like someone to point at some decent documentation, example, or tutorial covering how to do this keep in mind Im using Android. They have plenty of stuff on how to use Drive with the Google App Engine I have already looked at it and I have no idea how to go from that to an Android app.p  pI need to know which libraries I need to download and add to my project, what I need to add to my manifest, and how I can ultimately get a list of files from Google Drive, download one, and then upload a modified version.p  pIdeally, Id like it to handle accounts automatically, the way that the officially Google Drive app does.p

Negative 2579 pI have a form in an ASP.Net MVC project on which I am using qTip2 to display validation erros. On that form, I also have text fields that are activateddeacivated depending on choices made with radio buttons. When fields are not to be used, I set their disableddisabled properties. This ensures that client side validation jQuery unobtrusive validation for these fields is also deactivated. Now, I am wondering how to reset the qTip2 bubbles for fields that get disabled.p  pLets say I have radio buttons 1 and 2 that enable text boxes A and B respectively. Lets also say that radio button 1 is selected by default, and that text boxes A and B are required fields when the corresponding radio button is selected. If I press on the Submit button without filling any text field,  a qTip error bubble appears beside text box A. Now, if I press on radio button 2, I have to clear that bubble, disable text box A and its validation, and enable text box B and its validation. However, if I press submit at this point without filling text box B, no error bubble appears and the form is not getting submitted.p  pI tried various combinations of the following commands to accomplish this, but then the validation errors get completely disabledp  precode.qtip.remove .qtip.hide input.inputvalidationerror.removeClassinputvalidationerror  watch out for the error message labels or they wont go away form.datavalidator.resetForm form.validate.form codepre  pNo matter what combinations of these commands I execute after a radio button got clicked and the proper textboxes disabledenabled, the qTip bubbles disappear, but they never reappear even if I click on the Submit button and other errors should appear on the form.p  pI am probably not using the right commands to reset qTip validation bubbles.p

Negative 2579 pIm attempting to convert a Jpeg file with, 200 dpi, to a PDF file, however, when I save the file as a PDF I think its changing the dpi to 72, and thus making the image larger.

Negative 2579 pI know its a bizarre questionp  pThe requirement is due to the existing code which expects the result of the XPath query to be a single node.  Unfortunately, we are unable to make code changes at this time due to factors outside of our control unless no workaround exists, which would probably mean that we would have to delay our release.p  pIn my case, the XPath currently returns an integer value countp  precodecountsomeNodenode codepre  pThe code uses codeXPathNavigator.SelectSingleNodecode method, which, of course, fails because the result is not a node.p  pInstead, I need the XPath to return a node, albeit a fake one.  Is it possible  Note that because .NET is used, the XPath would have to be 1.0 not 2.0.p  pP.S. And, yes, well look into refactoring the code in question ASAPp

Negative 2579 pI am relatively new to JQuery, so please excuse this question if it seems trivial.  I have a page, as outlined by the HTML below, with three tab elements, each of which may have an unspecified number of collapsible elements within.

What I am unable to do with the following code is activate the collapsible elements.  I am guessing that some JQuery is required that is different from that presented on the Bootstrap documentation.  I have tried various permutations of the activating functions listed there, but because I am not yet very well versed in the use of JQuery, have been unsuccessful.

Negative 2579 pThe problem arises when a computer has more than one hard drive.  The excel spread sheet will not align up properly.  When the next computer in the array fills in the spread sheet, it will not place its data under the 2 drives from the previous machine. If all the machines have one drive, all is great.  The c drive should line up with the rest of the data To understand what I mean, I have attached a screen shot of what I am talking about.  Check out the Drive info.  The C drive will continue to be more out of whack as more machines are added.

Negative 2579 pIm currently working on an app that matches users based on answered questions. I realized my algorithm in normal RoR and ActiveRecord queries but its waaay to slow to use it. To match one user with 100 other users takesp  precodeCompleted 200 OK in 17741ms Views 106.1ms  ActiveRecord 1078.6ms codepre  pon my local machine. But still... I now want to realize this in raw SQL in order to gain some more performance. But Im really having trouble getting my head around SQL queries inside of SQL queries and stuff like this plus calculations etc. My head is about to explode and I dont even know where to start.p  pHeres my algorithmp  precodedef matchuser   ascore  self.actualscoreuser.tof  self.possiblescoreuser.tof  100   bscore  user.actualscoreself.tof  user.possiblescoreself.tof  100    if self.commonquestionsuser  []     0.tof   else     match  Math.sqrtascore  bscore  100  self.commonquestionsuser.count     if match lt 0       0.tof     else       match     end   end end  def possiblescoreuser   i  0   self.userquestions.selectquestionid, importance.findeach do n     if user.userquestions.selectid.findbyquestionidn.questionid       i  Importance.findbyidn.importance.value     end   end   return i end  def actualscoreuser   i  0   self.userquestions.selectquestionid, importance.includesacceptedanswers.findeach do n     useranswer  user.userquestions.selectanswerid.findbyquestionidn.questionid     unless useranswer  nil       if n.acceptedanswers.selectanswerid.findbyansweriduseranswer.answerid         i  Importance.findbyidn.importance.value       end     end   end   return i end codepre  pSo basically a user answers a questions, picks what answers he accepts and how important that question is to him. The algorithm then checks what questions 2 users have in common, if user1 gave an answer user2 accepts, if yes then the importance user2 gave for each question is added which makes up the score user1 made. Also the other way around for user2. Divided by the possible score gives the percentage and both percentages applied to the geometric mean gives me one total match percentage for both users. Fairly complicated I know. Tell if I didnt explain it good enough. I just hope I can express this in raw SQL.

These functions are, however, not used by my tool.p  pI wonder how this additional dependency is caused by debug builds  is it possible that these debug symbols are produced for all symbols, not only the ones I use, and for these debug symbols, the default parameters are also requiredp  pThis is with Sun Studio 5.10 on Solaris.p

Negative 2579 pI am trying to calculate Chi Square discrepancies for my data and for a similar simulated dataset to evaluate the fit of a model using Bayesian inference. My problem is that my dataset contains missing values but my simulated dataset does not, so I cant compare the discrepancy stats from each.p  pHere is some simulated data similar to what Im working withp  precodep lt arrayrunif30001956, 0, 1, c3000, 195, 6 N lt arrayrpois3000195, 10, c3000, 195 y lt array0, c195, 6 forj in 1195   fork in 16     y[j,k] lt rbinom1, N[j], p[1,j,k]      foo lt runif50, 1, 195 bar lt runif50, 1, 6 fori in 150   y[foo[i], bar[i]] lt NA  codepre  pThis gives my response variable y with some missing values NA. Now I calculate basically a Chi Square for my data y and for a simulated ideal dataset y.new. However, y.new does not have any missing values, so when I try to compare the sum of E and E.new, E.new should always be larger if I leave out the missing data in y but not y.new. p  precodeeval lt arrayNA, c3000, 195, 6 E lt arrayNA, c3000, 195, 6 E.new lt arrayNA, c3000, 195, 6 y.new lt arrayNA, c195, 6 fori in 13000   forj in 1195     fork in 16        eval[i,j,k] lt p[i,j,k]N[i,j]        E[i,j,k] lt y[j,k]  eval[i,j,k]2  eval[i,j,k]  0.5        y.new[i,j,k] lt rbinom1, N[i,j], p[i,j,k]   Create new ideal dataset        E.new[i,j,k] lt y.new[i,j,k]  eval[i,j,k]2  eval[i,j,k]  0.5           very slow think about how to vectorize instead of nested for loops  fit lt sumE fit.new lt sumE.new codepre  pMy question is how best handle the missing values Currently, the code above cannot subtract eval from y because of the missing values. Even if it could, the fit and fit.new wouldnt be comparable. My idea is to find the location of the missing values in y and drop those same [j,k] values from all the other arrays that Im using. Any suggestions on how to best do thisp  pEDIT Im getting a very strange result. Whether I run the code as above or as below using sweep, E[1,,] is much smaller than E[1,,]. What is particularly strange is that eval[1,,] and eval[1,,] appear to be the same. I even tried replicating y[j,k] to make it y[i,j,k] where each y[i,,] were equal, just to see if it was the handling of different size matrices that was the problem. Does anyone know why this would be the case In theory, with this simulated data, I think all the iterations of E[i,,] and E.new[i,,] should be somewhat similar. Below is some summary info to show what Im talking about. This seems like a new question, but it relates to my original question, I just thought it must be the NA that were causing the problem but it seems like that might not be the only thing going on.p  precodegt summaryeval[1,,]        V1                 V2                 V3                V4            Min.    0.01167   Min.    0.01476   Min.    0.0293   Min.    0.01953    1st Qu. 2.60909   1st Qu. 2.35093   1st Qu. 2.5239   1st Qu. 1.85789    Median  4.85460   Median  5.12719   Median  5.2480   Median  4.35639    Mean    5.09371   Mean    5.39451   Mean    5.3891   Mean    4.72061    3rd Qu. 6.91273   3rd Qu. 7.44676   3rd Qu. 7.5431   3rd Qu. 7.06119    Max.   15.81298   Max.   14.94309   Max.   14.9851   Max.   16.25751    gt summaryeval1[2,,]        V1                 V2                 V3                V4             Min.    0.06346   Min.    0.06468   Min.    0.2092   Min.    0.006769    1st Qu. 2.44825   1st Qu. 1.93702   1st Qu. 2.4226   1st Qu. 2.426689    Median  4.16865   Median  4.01536   Median  5.0771   Median  4.833679    Mean    4.85646   Mean    4.64887   Mean    5.3450   Mean    5.169656    3rd Qu. 6.64691   3rd Qu. 6.96278   3rd Qu. 7.7034   3rd Qu. 7.229125    Max.   13.00335   Max.   13.79093   Max.   17.2673   Max.   17.915080    gt summaryE[1,,]        V1                V2                V3                 V4            Min.   0.00001   Min.   0.00000   Min.   0.000003   Min.   0.000008    1st Qu.0.02744   1st Qu.0.02723   1st Qu.0.023008   1st Qu.0.035854    Median 0.11750   Median 0.11889   Median 0.109138   Median 0.146706    Mean   0.39880   Mean   0.41636   Mean   0.353876   Mean   0.479533    3rd Qu.0.46435   3rd Qu.0.40993   3rd Qu.0.390625   3rd Qu.0.604021    Max.   4.43466   Max.   4.83871   Max.   6.254577   Max.   5.231650    NAs   10        NAs   8         NAs   8          NAs   10          gt summaryE[2,,]        V1                 V2                  V3             Min.     0.0000   Min.     0.00003   Min.     0.00002    1st Qu.  0.8213   1st Qu.  0.42091   1st Qu.  0.36853    Median   2.0454   Median   2.31697   Median   2.39892    Mean     8.0619   Mean     9.40838   Mean     6.38919    3rd Qu.  5.6755   3rd Qu.  6.34782   3rd Qu.  4.89749    Max.   395.9499   Max.   172.83324   Max.   120.93648    NAs   10         NAs   8           NAs   8           codepre  pThanks, Danp

Negative 2579 pfirst thanks to everyone for their contributionsassistance to these forums. Ive searched online for days and I cant find a solution tofigure out whats wrong. I have a form panel, which initially has a single row container using hbox layout of a set of fields comboboxes, textfields, buttons, etc which a user can use to build boolean statement. This container also has buttons for AND, OR and DEL which can be used for appending another row boolean statement or deleting the current row to the form panel. I have local stores for the combobox values and this works all works finegood...sort of. My problem is after a user has typed in a value into any of the comboboxes and when they add a new row, the combobox list of the new row is limited to what was chosen in the prior row  and only that value. I can see that the store of the new rows combobox has all the right values via firebug, but these arent accessible through the GUI. I thought it was a browser issue, but cant shake it in Ffox nor IE. Its never a problem if they only select via the mouse. Ive tried stripping down the combobox config, etc, searching online, using a fieldset instead of container.

Negative 2579 pI used to be on codeDreamweavercode, but I have since really gotten into codeAptanacode Studio 3. I have finally gotten the code coloring down correctly, but one thing I really miss from codeDreamweavercode is the dynamic discovery and completion using custom classes. I cannot figure out how to do that in codeAptanacode Studio though. Here is what I meanp  pWith codeDreamweavercode I could create a file such as class.phpp  precodeltphp   class Test     function construct       function something     var  test     return var       gt codepre  pAnd then I could include it in say index.phpp  precodeltphp  includeonceclass.php  test  new Test echo testgtsomething  gt codepre  pOnce I included the class in my code and then typed test  new  codeDreamweavercode would then automatically popup Test for me to chooose. And then of course any variables to pass along. Also, when I typed test codeDreamweavercode would also pop up a list of the functions within that class for me to choose from as well and it would do this dynamically.p  pSo my question is How do I get this same functionality with codeAptanacode Studio 3 I am currently using codeAptanacode Studio with the remote explorer to open and edit files from a webserver. I have found a few suggestions via codeGooglecode about using projects, but I am not really interested in projects right now. I just want to open the file and edit it andor just create a new file directly on the server.p  pSo, is there anyone out there who knows how to get codeAptanacode Studio to dynamically detect custom classes and use them for code completion like codeDreamweavercode doesp  pThanks to everyone in advance.p

Negative 2579 pI am trying to wrap my head around IoC containers. As I delve deeper into this design pattern I come across multitudes of abstraction layers, interfaces and concrete classes when before I was simply instantiating a datacontext class, using it and then disposing of it.p  pWhilst I am keen to continue forward there are some outstanding issues I dont know how to resolve and would like some clarification and guidance.p  ol lipIn a generic web application with 2 projects mvc web amp data layer containing e.f., if our dependancy resolver expects a repository that implements a specific interface allowing us to switch repositories at any time in the future, where is this interface defined  I dont see how it can be defined in the mvc web project because then the data access layer will become dependant on it and it cannot reside in the data access layer as then the mvc project depends on the dal and ive missed the whole point of this excercise.  So is the answer to define it in both projects and have each project reference its own copy ..Is that even possible Or do i need to create a third service layer project and stick one interface declaration in it and have both projects reference thispli lipIve seen a number of articles talking about Unity IoC with interfaces such as IProductRepository, IClientRepository and IProductService, IClientService this is what I was referring to in my opening paragraph. Am I correct in assuming that each of these instances is supposed to reference a table in my database If so what happens if i have 50 tables do i need to create 50 repository interfaces and 50 table related interfaces just to decouple everything And how does using EF with POCO classes impact things do i need to have each POCO implement its own specified interfacepli ol  pthanksp

For example, the PathView object documentation at a hrefhttpqtproject.orgdocqt4.8qmlpathview.html relnofollowhttpqtproject.orgdocqt4.8qmlpathview.htmla doesnt say what properties its model needs to support.

Negative 2579 pThis is a serious question, I am stuck at this point between understanding it and not at all. I got very confused with the time reading different resources and would like someone to point me in the right direction.p  pI am working with Android platform, until now I have used the codeCanvascode, some codeOpenGL ES 1.0code, but mostly through engines or already built code to try and understand it. p  pMy goal is to ACTUALLY understand codeOpenGL ES 2.0code. I do not want to go straight to the complicated stuff and start with easy stuff, but I just dont get how to do it. I can get a square, and I can set up a camera and matrices to tell you the truth I really dont understand the whole matrix system and how it works, if I am right it was a emfixedfunctionpipelineem which you didnt need to change in codeOpenGL ES 1.0code but now its a emprogrammablepipelineem which you have to set up on your own. p  pI do not get how to use the coordinate system, I know that the origin is the center of the device and each turn to the edge is 1, so from center to left it would be negative 1.p  pThere were some ways however to make it into a different coordinate system, maybe just use proportions or multiply matrices to set the coordination to something that I was used to from the codeCanvascode. p  pBasically what I need help with is how do I progress from here I feel as if I got to somewhere, but I am still nowhere.p  pI really need some advises on how to properly use codeOpenGL ES 2.0code, for now all I am planning on is a simple 2D game, maybe side scroller too so I will have to mess with the camera matrices.p  pThank you for your time, I will greatly appreciate any help. p  pI am less interested in the transformation matrices since I do not think that 2D game would really use that, maybe only when I mirror the characters sprite so it would look as if he is walking in a different direction, but Im pretty sure this is possible to be made simple by changing the coordination and width.p
Negative 2579 pI have a set of C classes generated by the a hrefhttpjson2csharp.com relnofollowjson2charpa web utility from a JSON response resulting from a REST call.

I tried to use the property in a emforloopem using the arrays strongLengthstrong property but the Length property is unavailable in the current scope.  Im guessing this is because it is an internal class  p  pTo work around the problem I added a public property called strongCountBreedsstrong that just returns the array Length. That works fine.  But Im wondering if there is a way to get the Length of an internal classs array property without having to make properties just to expose the Length property of the array  If not, is there a way to iterate the array without adding IEnumerable support to the classp  pI know I could remove the internal specifier but Id like to keep it if I can.  Code snippets belowp  precode The internal class I want to iterate. internal class Breeds       [JsonPropertybreed]     public Breed[] Breed  get set       [JsonPropertyanimal]     public string Animal  get set        This property was added to facilitate for loopsthat iterate the       entire array, since the Length propery of the array property       can not be accessed.     public int CountBreeds              get                      return Breed.Length                 internal class Breeds   Code that iterates the above class.   gtgtgtgt This doesnt work since the Breeds Length property   is unavailable in this context.   Add the breeds to the list we return. for int i  0 i lt jsonPF.Petfinder.Breeds.Length i     listRet.AddjsonPF.Petfinder.Breeds.Breed[i].T    gtgtgtgt This does work because I added manually the CountBreeds   property not autogenerated by json2csharp.

Negative 2579 pBackground  A part of my system uses utf8encode to convert html code to utf8 format before passing it on to jsonencode.p  pProblem Everything was fine until I entered UTF8 charactersChinese into the system. I noticed that the mentioned UTF8 characters were encoded twice and came out garbled. p  pSidenote I have no experience with charset encoding and whatnot until now. Perhaps I dont need to use utf8encode before jsonencode since my database and connections are already set to utf8. Without the Chinese characters in the html code, mbdetectencoding would return ASCIInot ISO88591. But I couldnt get through jsonencode without returning null... thus the use of utf8 encode which worked until now.p  pUpdate I finally solved the issue by typecasting the html code as string via stringhtml before assigning it to jsonencode.p  pThanks to all who posted here that led me to the final solution.p

Negative 2579 pI have two intertwined problems to solve.p  pMy stock photography website is driven by a PERLscripted program called ImageFolio, purchased in 2005. The program allows for display of photos by categories, or by searching keywords, which then deliver pages of thumbnail images matching the contents of an entire category, or images with keywords or image titles matching the search terms. Clicking a thumbnail image displays a dynamically generated page showing a larger view of the image. p  pSince the same images can be displayed from multiple searches, its important to designate a emcanonicalem page in the HEAD section of the dynamically generated pages by using a strongRegExstrong expression to capture the relevant variable information from the dynamic URL, to create and specify a stronglink relcanonicalstrong tag in the HEAD section of each page.  Corresponding strongMODREWRITEstrong statements are required in the .htaccess file to translate those static canonical links back to properly structured dynamic links to deliver the proper content.p  pSome typical dynamically generated URLs and preferred static URL substitutes arep  pemDirect link to a category displaying a page of thumbnails from that categoryembr strongDYNAMICstrong www.artminds.comcgibinImageFolio4imageFolio.cgidirectAthleticsandSportsbr strongDESIRED STATIC CANONICALstrong www.artminds.comstockphotosAthleticsandSportsbr strongMODREWRITEstrong Same as dynamic above  p  pemSearch for images by clicking a clickable keyword on an image pageembr strongDYNAMICstrong www.artminds.comcgibinImageFolio4imageFolio.cgiimg0ampsearchsix20packampcatallampboolphrasebr strongDESIRED STATIC CANONICALstrong www.artminds.comphotosearchsixpack.htmlbr strongMODREWRITEstrong cgibinImageFolio4imageFolio.cgisearchsixpack  p  pemSearch for images by typing a keyword in the search boxembr strongDYNAMICstrong www.artminds.comcgibinImageFolio4imageFolio.cgisearchsixpackampboolandampcatampx0ampy0br strongDESIRED STATIC CANONICALstrong www.artminds.comsixpack.htmlbr strongMODREWRITEstrong cgibinImageFolio4imageFolio.cgisearchsixpack  p  pemDisplay single image page from clicking a thumbnailembr strongDYNAMICstrong www.artminds.comcgibinImageFolio4imageFolio.cgiactionviewamplinkOnLocationampimage1038310.jpgampimg0ampsearchsix20packampcatallampttampboolandbr strongDESIRED STATIC CANONICALstrong www.artminds.com1038310Muscularyoungmanposingshirtlesswithcowboyhatandbluejeans.htmlbr strongMODREWRITEstrong cgibinImageFolio4imageFolio.cgiactionviewamplinkOnLocationampimage1038310  p  pemstrongNotestrong The long file name in the DESIRED CANONICAL immediately above comes from the image caption which is displayed in the HTML Title Tag of the image display page, retrieved via variables in the script program that extract the embedded metadata in the image file.

Negative 2579 pIm using mysql and Im having trouble thinking of a query to count the number of usersvisitors for a certain date range. The way that Im currently doing it is using php, I select the date range and process the data in a for loop and then just count them there. Its actually pretty easy, but the problem is that this method does not work for bigger data of a few million rows. The alternative is to count the distinct values using mysql only and just return a count and not actual data by utilizing the index on the timestamp column. Also, converting the column to a datetime is not an option. Any ideas how I can achieve thisp  pHeres a sample result set of what I needp  precodedate      count 50113     14 50213     44 50313     23 50413     13 codepre  pMy problem is that I dont know how to group the timestamp column by day.p

Negative 2579 pIm trying to reverse a string in C. The reverse function simply assigns the character at a given location in a for loop to a temp object. I cannot see any logic errors within the program, and the program compile successfully under gcc 4.7.2 with this commandp  precodegcc Wall stdc99 reverse.c codepre  pTo recreate the problem p  p1. Run the program and enter a string into your shellp  p2. Once finished inputting, press enterand or your EOF signal. p  pThe problem is that neither the original string is printed, or the reversed string. This is also an exercise from KampR second edition, if you have completed this exercise, a different solution to mine would be appreciated. p  pI think the bug is caused by the absence of a null character, the famous printf requires a null terminated string to print input to cin. The getline function assigns a null character to the end of the array, surely the null character will be the first character in the string thereto ending the printf and thus no characterliteral is printed. p  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt  define MAXLINE 1000  int gelinechar s[], int lim void reversechar line[],  int length  int main       char s[MAXLINE]     char t[MAXLINE]     int k, len      while len  getlines, MAXLINE gt 0          if len gt 1              reverses, len          printfs, s     return 0   void reverse char input[], int length       char temp[MAXLINE]     int j  length     for int i  0 i lt length i, j               temp[i]  input[i]             input[i]  input[j]             input[j]  temp           int getlinechar s[], int lim      int c, i      for i0 cgetchar  EOF ampamp cn i          s[i]  c     if c n          s[i]  c         i          s[i]  0     return i  codepre

Negative 2579 pI have an idea for a social web app and part of the idea is to pull data from localstorage onto the server database. The reason for this is say you have an idea and you want to put it on your next status for this social app, but you have no signal and wireless anywhere. You write out the status on the app and it saves it to the localstorage for use when they get back to somewhere where they can connect their phone online.p  pThey then get to a place where they can go online, the app then detects that there is a change in the localstorage and then pulls it from there and saves to the server database.p  pIs this at all possible, if so how would you go about implementing it If its not at all possible, do you think this could be sometime in the futurep  pI look forward to hearing from your comments and answers on this one as I think it could be quite a big discussion.p

Negative 2579 pIm used to working with Swing to create GUIs but for a recent project Ive chosen to switch to JavaFX. Im having some trouble with recreating a certain layout I used to make using a GridLayout.p  pI desire the following behavior 2 columns that scale proportionally with the size of their parent that center their contents.p  pUsing Swing, I would make JPanel with a GridLayout 1 row, 2 columns and add 2 JPanels with a BorderLayout, adding the actual content to those panels with the centered constraint. Then I could add the first panel to any container that has a layout that stretches with the frame and all would be well.p  pI seem to be unable to recreate this behavior in JavaFX in a simple way. I can think of ways to do it using bindings and combining several panes but I was hoping there is a layout that does this automatically. Ive tried using TilePane, HBox, GridPane, AnchorPane, SplitPane and even BorderPane but none of them seem to do what I want them to.p  pIs there a recommended way to accomplish this I would much prefer not to embed Swing into the application. Basically what I want is to be able to split the content into two columns that automatically stretch with the StageScene JFrame.p

We saw a strong20200strong performance improvement compared to FileAppender with codebufferedIOtruecodebrbr strongbufferedIOstrongboolean    When true  the default, records will be written to a buffer and the data will be written to disk when the buffer is full or, if immediateFlush is set, when the record is written. File locking cannot be used with bufferedIO. Performance tests have shown that using buffered IO significantly improves performance, even if immediateFlush is enabled.brbr strongimmediateFlushstrongboolean When set to true  the default, each write will be followed by a flush. This will guarantee the data is written to disk but could impact performance. Flushing after every write is only useful when using this appender with synchronous loggers. Asynchronous loggers and appenders will automatically flush at the end of a batch of events, even if immediateFlush is set to false. This also guarantees the data is written to disk but is more efficient.p  pBy using above attributes we can control the writing data to the file, But I didnt find the way to store the log in memory and then log it after reaching particular buffer size. brbr strongUpdatestrong Added new feature request in LOG4J2jiraproject a hrefhttpsissues.apache.orgjirabrowseLOG4J2401 relnofollowLOG4J2401a.p

Negative 2579 pIn my project I have two models which have identical attributes, methods and everything the same. p  pat the moment they are in appmodels in separate rb files, with quite some repetition of code. p  pI would like to export all that code to a separate file and have the two files referring to it, and have mode DRY code. p  pIve tried the following, but it didnt work p  precode appmodelsorder.rb class Order lt ActiveRecordBase   beforesave  self.version  1     attraccessible order   attraccessible filleddate    validates order, presence gt true end codepre  pand one of the referring orders is p  precode appmodelsrealorder.rb class RealOrder lt Order   belongsto User, inverseof realorders end codepre  pbut this doesnt work, and I get a codeCould not find table orderscode when I try to use the models.p  pAlso Im thinking that codeOrderscode is not a real model, so probably the codeappmodelscode is not really the right place for that file, though Im not sure in what directory it should be. p  pthanks, p  pUPD1  The structure I would like to achieve in the end is a situation where I have two identical database tables, with two separate models that are based on the same code. I would like to write such code only once in a separate superclass file. So Im looking for DRY code, not DRY database. p
Negative 2579 pA very common coding practice is to separate the interface of a class from the implementation of its member functions through the use of code.hcode and code.cppcode files on a perclass basis. So codeclass Foocode would be realised with a codeFoo.hcode header file and a corresponding codeFoo.cppcode file. p  pThis is often thrown out of the window in the special case of generic classes and instead a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiHeaderonly relnofollowheaderonlya libraries are used to keep the compiler happy even though it does clutter the interface file with implementation details.p  pIve recently come accross some code written as follows. The code.hcode file contains the interface and a codeincludecode to a code.hppcode file which contains the implementation of the generic member functions. p  pe.g. for a simple container of type T codeValue.hcodep  precodeifndef VALUEH define VALUEH  template lttypename Tgt class Value  public     ValueT value     void setT value     T get const private     T data   include Value.hpp  endif codepre  pand the corresponding codeValue.hppcodep  precodeifndef VALUEHPP define VALUEHPP  template lttypename Tgt ValueltTgtValueT value  datavalue    template lttypename Tgt void ValueltTgtsetT value      data  value   template lttypename Tgt T ValueltTgtget const      return data   endif codepre  pThis has the advantage of better separating interface and implementation coupled with the further benefit of actually compiling in my limited testing.p  pMy question is then strongare there any hidden pitfalls with adopting this conventionstrongp
Negative 2579 pIm using CodeBlocks with MinGW, under Windows 7. Im writing a multithreaded web crawler with libcurl, using a a hrefhttpcurl.haxx.selibcurlccurlsharesetopt.html relnofollowCURLSHa object with CURLLOCKDATACOOKIE enabled to share cookies among different threads. Once a handle receives a cookie, it is successfully shared among every other handle. However, I need to copy the initial set of cookies from Firefox or Chrome. I found that they store cookies using sqlite, and Ive been able to read cookies from both of them from within my program. The problem is, how do I give these cookies to libcurl Ideally, there should be some way to feed these cookies to my CURLSH  object, so that they get distributed to every handle. I have found no such thing.p  pFollowing a hrefhttpwww.cookiecentral.comfaq3.5 relnofollowthis documenta, I can try to save the cookies I read from my browser to a emcookies.txtem file, which reduces to finding a correspondence between the fields in the database used by FirefoxChrome and the Netscape format. Netscape uses the following formatp  blockquote   pdomain flag path secure expiration name valuep blockquote  pThe problem comes with the flag field. I dont know what to write there. Firefox uses the following fields file emcookies.sqliteem, table mozcookies, which correspond with the Netscape format as follows is this correctp  blockquote   phost  path isSecure expiry name valuep blockquote  pChrome uses the following fields file emCookiesem, table emcookiesemp  blockquote   phostkey  path secure expiresutc name valuep blockquote  pSo, to create this emcookies.txtem file, Im only missing that flag field. The document linked above saysp  blockquote   pflag  A TRUEFALSE value indicating if all machines within a given domain   can access the variable. This value is set automatically by the   browser, depending on the value you set for domain.p blockquote  pWhich doesnt really tell me what to write there. However, writting a file and then reading it seems like unnecessary work, given that Ill first load the cookies from FirefoxChrome in RAM, and I should be able to give them to libcurl directly without going through the hard drive. Ive found the a hrefhttpcurl.haxx.selibcurlccurleasysetopt.htmlCURLOPTCOOKIE relnofollowCURLOPTCOOKIEa option, but it is missing some fields namely, domain. Also, that option doesnt seem to save the cookies for posterior use. It looks like I would need to call it for every transaction with only the cookies of the corresponding domain and what if these cookies get changed I would not want to check for changes manually, given that libcurl can do that.p  pSo, given that I have all my cookies from FirefoxChrome in memory, how do I give them to libcurl If the only option is to use a emcookies.txtem file, what should I write in the flag fieldp
Negative 2579 pIm having problems understanding how does a form submit in Spring 3 MVC work.p  pWhat I want to do, is to create a controller which would take the users name and display it to him.

But looks, it works in a very different way. If I remove the linep  precodemodel.addAttributeperson, new Person codepre  pfrom showHelloPage method I get an common exception Neither BindingResult nor....p  pAlso, on the beginning, the sayHello method looked likep  precode... public String sayHelloModelAttributeperson Person person, Model model  ... codepre  pI mean, it had the ModelAttribute annotation. I added it, because in the tutorials I have read, it was always present. But after I removed it, everything worked well, as it did before.p  pstrongSo my question isstrong  what is the use of the ModelAttribute anonnatation Is it some way to omit a modelAttribute attribute in a form And the second part, what is the way maybe some annotation to make a form automatically bind inputs values to the proper beans properties which would be declared as a method parameter Without a need of adding an empty bean before sending a form as I have to do it now.p  pThanks for your replies which arent links to the Springs documentation, because I have already read it.p

When the device is offline, I am appending the log to a text file. p  pOn every run, I am planning to check the reachability of the server and if it is reachable a background thread is started which rotates the log file, uploads the old log file using POST request to the server and deletes the old log file from device.

Negative 2579 pUsing plone 4.p  pI last used plone 5 years ago, am rusty with python and generally do not consider myself a developer these days. I am just wondering if what I am trying to do isp  ol liPossible without coding.li liIf not, what are the resources I need to read up on, before I get somewhere.li ol  pStatement of the problemp  pI am developing a plone site for a medium sized academic organization it does not have its own IT department and is generally unaware of CMSes. The organization has one overall leader. The organization is divided into 5 groups consisting of various users. Each of these 5 groups has a group leader. The plone site has internal and external publication workflow it came as an addon, I think.p  pI have created 5 groups Group15 on my plone site to reflect this structure. I have also created a group called GroupLeaders that contains the 5 leaders of the 5 groups. Each user has a personal folder. Further, each group has a group folder. There is also an overall organization folder. p  pRead r  write w  internal publication ip  external publication ep permissionsp  pUser folder  user r w ip ep Group folder  user r w, group leader r w ip ep Organization folder  user r w, group leader r w ip, organization leader r w ip ep.p  pFurther, group leaders are also nominal members of their groups. Finally, the organization leader belongs to one of the 5 groups. The organization leader and group leader are never the same person.p  pThe identities of group leaders and organization leader change after a fixed period of 2 years. Upon losing their leader status, the users become simple members of that group users.p  pI am trying to implement the following workflowp  pUsers in any of the groups can create documents of any kind in their personal folder which is published externally immediately. All documents created by a user in a Group folder have to be approved for internal  external publication by the concerned group leader. However, mere membership in GroupLeaders is not enough. Only the GroupLeader of group 2 say should be able to approve  deny edits made by a member of group 2. So, I need something like meta codep  pIf member belongsto GroupLeader ampamp member belongsto Group 2    assign approval workflow to member endp  pHow do I do thisp

Negative 2579 pRunning on a 8core 64G EC2 instance, I have a Java application whose main thread caches some dozends of gigabyte of data in a Hashmap. When the caching is done, 16 worker threads are spawned being subclasses of Thread. They receive a reference to the Hashmap. The worker threads just read the cached data, they never ever modify it. Id expect that all worker threads see the same cached data. This isnt however the case. It turns out that the data in the Hashmap has holes. For some keys the worker thread sees no values. This happens always for the same keys When I spawn just 1 worker thread, all is fine however. Any ideas whats going wrong herep

When I remove it then both execute but clf.fit takes very long time to converge for large datasets. My data size is 600 x 12 matrix for both positive and negatives. Can you tell me what exactly njobs will do and how it should be used Also is there any faster fitting technique or modification in code that can be applied to make it faster p  pProblem 2 also StandardScaler should be used upon positive and negative data combined or separately for both  I suppose it has to be used combined because then only we can use the scaler parameters upon the test sets. p
Negative 2579 pI have a problem where multiple objects are created and then they need to be enriched, the problem is creation support multiple objects to be created so batched, while enrichment interface allows one object per call.

Negative 2579 pI have many large wordlist files and want to create hash tables with them to speed up aircrack. I know very little about hash tables.

Negative 2579 pId like to set up a video calling service while doing serverside work with the video stream in Node.js.

I considered using something like Binary.js to transfer video data, but that would be much slower.

Negative 2579 pI have a comment box set up on various pages of a website. Since all the comments posted are stored in a common database, I have it send the website each comment is made on usingp  precodeSERVER[REQUESTURI] codepre  pThe page then displays all comments that match the current page. The problem Im having is having comments show when there are slight alterations to the url, for example, if the url has comments at the end of it I have a shortcut link at the top of the page that scrolls users down to the comments section using an anchor tag like that, it now only displays comments that also have comments at the end of the url they were created on. Obviously this is a problem since users that scroll down on their own wont have comments on the end of the page url and then they wont see all the comments.p  pThis is the function Im using to find the appropriate comments in my database to displayp  precodefunction findcomments      global connection      query   SELECT       query . FROM comments      query . WHERE pagename  .SERVER[REQUESTURI].     query . ORDER BY created DESC     displaycomments  mysqliqueryconnection, query     confirmquerydisplaycomments     return displaycomments  codepre  pSo Im wondering if there is a better way to display the correct comments. I guess I could have a value like a page ID number I specify for each page that will post with the info, but Id rather have a solution that I dont have to remember to update every time I create a new page that needs a comment box.p  pAny help would be super appreciatedp

Negative 2579 pI posted before, but I was focusing on why my app was crashing from Testflight but from Xcode.

Would it require maybe a Team.class to link everyone or can it be handled by local references and I just cant find any examples.p

Negative 2579 pemPreamble Im trying to follow TDD methodology on my project while being new to Node.js in whole and Zombie.js in particular.emp  pI have an all AJAX HTML page I load with Zombie.js. That page performs few XMLHttpRequest queries to my server, and loads few JS files via codeltscriptgtcode tags with GET arguments to them JS files are generated on fly. However, starting server, all the supplementary stuff, resetting states of all these is very expensive, and keeping track of autogenerated JS files is complex to implement, so I want to essentially mock communication server without page noticiting.p  pOne approach Ive thought about is replacing codeXMLHttpRequestcode with hook object of my own via codebrowser.evaluatecode, but using this way I gain no control over how browser does any other requests, like for codeltscript srcfoo.jsmagicquuxgtcode or codeltimg srctracker.gifkeyfoobargtcode.p  pSecond approach is to redirect whole browser instance through proxy, and implement proxy of my own  that would suffice, but Id prefer not to implement fullpledged HTTPS proxy for testing purposes only, as Ill end up testing proxy, and this wont end easily p  pSo, is there other solution, maybe, that will give me precise control about what is Zombie.js telling to outer world and what does world answerp
Negative 2579 pI find very frequently that while Im prototyping, and I change the base type of the code behind class, or something like that, that the two files become completely unaware of  each other.

But this does not work. It doesnt seem to compile the XAML at all unless there is a code behind.p  pWhat can I do to reconnect these two files, in most casesp
Negative 2579 pI coded a VBA script in Excel which adds new data into a Datasheet with previous information. Before doing that, the new data is copied into a provisional Datasheet. To prevent duplicates, I create an additional column and do a VLOOKUP of IDs. If the ID from the new imported data is already in the Datasheet with the old data, this row is marked as duplicated and will be deleted. The nonduplicated rows are then copied into the final Datasheet, where all the data is stored.p  pRight now I use a column reference AA in the VLOOKUP and I dont know if maybe this is the reason why the VBA script needs every day more resources and time to run.p  pAs a Best Practice, should I dynamically reference the range in the VLOOKUP instead of using AA or it doesnt matter in terms of speed When I coded for the first time, I did the test with no more than 4000 rows in the original Datasheet and 4000 rows in the imported data. The macro was done after 90 seconds. Right now, it needs more than 5 minutes and the Datasheet with data is just 40.000 rows large, while the new data is always around 4000 rows.   p

Negative 2579 pIf I have two classes D1 and D2 that both derive from class Base, and I want to construct a particular one based on say, a boolean variable, there are various well known techniques, eg use a factory, or use smart pointers. p  pFor example, p  precode    stduniqueptrltBasegt b     if flag                  b.resetnew D1          else                  b.resetnew D2      codepre  pBut this uses the heap for allocation, which is normally fine but I can think of times where it would be good to avoid the performance hit of a memory allocation. p  pI triedp  precodeBase b  flag  D1  D2       doesnt compile  Baseamp b  flag  D1  D2      doesnt compile  Baseampamp b  flag  D1  D2     doesnt compile  Baseampamp b  flag  stdmoveD1  stdmoveD2    doesnt compile codepre  pMy intention is that D1 or D2 whichever is chosen is constructed on the stack, and its lifetime ends when b goes out of scope.

Further, it would only be suitable for classes that are inexpensive to copy, because despite my explicit request to use move, it does I think still call a copy constructor.

Negative 2579 pWell I created my first custom control with two dependency properties. One is a codedecimalcode and the other one has a codeCustomTypecode of my own. So to test it I created a small project with only a window and tried to bind to it by using the Window itself as the data context like thisp  precodeltsomethinmycontrol MyDependencyPropertyBinding MyCustomTypegt codepre  pWhere codeMyCustomTypecodeis a Property  in MainWindow.cs and this did not work. So I made a guess and  gave the MainWindow a name and then specified the Element name and it worked like thisp  precodeltWindow xClassBC.WPF.TestArea.MainWindow ... xNameMyWindowgt ...       ltsomethinmycontrol MyDependencyPropertyBinding ElementNameMyWindow, PathMyCustomTypegt  .... ltWindowgt codepre  pSo in my experience the ElementName part shouldnt be necessary but it was working so I was satisfied until I tried using it in an ItemsControl. Then things got really weird. First I tried thisp  precodeltItemsControl ItemsSourceBinding ElementNameMyWindow, PathObservableMyCustomTypes gt     ltItemsControl.ItemTemplategt         ltDataTemplate DataTypesomehtingCustomType gt             ltStackPanel OrientationHorizontal gt                 ltLabel ContentBinding Name gt                 ltsomethinmycontrol  MyDependencyPropertyBinding gt             ltStackPanelgt         ltDataTemplategt     ltItemsControl.ItemTemplategt ltItemsControlgt codepre  pThe strange thing here is that codeCustomTypecode has a codeNamecode property and the Binding to codeContentcode in the label works but codeMyDependencyPropertyBindingcode doesnt. I also tried codeMyDependencyPropertyBinding .code without success so just out of curiosity I tried putting elements of type codeTupleltCustomTypegtcode in the collection instead and then binded to codeItem1code like thisp  precodeltItemsControl ItemsSourceBinding ElementNameMyWindow, PathObservableMyCustomTypes gt     ltItemsControl.ItemTemplategt         ltDataTemplate DataTypesystemTuple gt             ltStackPanel OrientationHorizontal gt                 ltLabel ContentBinding Item1.Name gt                 ltsomethinmycontrol  MyDependencyPropertyBinding Item1 gt             ltStackPanelgt         ltDataTemplategt     ltItemsControl.ItemTemplategt ltItemsControlgt codepre  pAnd the incredible thing is that the Binding in the label to codeItem1.Namecode works but the other binding doesnt which really puzzles me because now I really dont see what could be wrong with the path but the one with codeElementNameMyWindowcode works as expected. p  pWhat is going onp  pa hrefhttpsonedrive.live.comredirresid623CC4A0997920005364ampauthkeyAOd0Nmug0fuh2tgampithintfile2c.zip relnofollowHere is a link to a zip with the complete test projecta if you are curious. p

Negative 2579 pIve got a bit of a problem with my code. Im sure that it is something simple, but I just cant figure it out I have been on tons of forums and have read several books... but every answer that I have worked to has failed. I almost guarantee that its the way that I am using my syntax and yes I know... procedural PHP is not really used anymore but I am really a bit of a newbie to this and I am just trying to pick up the basics before moving onto OOP and PDO connections.p  pCould you please help me At the moment I can get the user to select their date from the date picker and the results specifically from that date only will return... only problem is that the event is displaying the eventid as opposed to the name of the event that it relates to 1  5km run for example.p  pSomehow I need to access the events table and pull the row that relates to that specific eventid.p  pI have normalized my database, and according to my tutor it looks ok. To give you an idea what it looks like  logins table all user logins details, results table a history of submitted events events table the events themselves. p  pOn the results table the foreign keys are loginsid and the eventid. The primary key is the resultsid in the results table and the only data stored here is the time and data individual columns.p  precodeltphp  Stage 1.

Negative 2579 pToday I realized something that appeared weird to me I noticed that when I just dop  precodetry      doSomething  catch Exception e   codepre  pit isnt slower at all than if I just dop  precodedoSomething codepre  pSo I ran a test and wrote down some quick code to proove what I saw, the code basically just loops over a function called doSomething lots of times, one time without and one time with trycatch surrounding it. So heres the code to it if you want to test it yourself    p  precodepublic class Main   private static final long LOOPS  1000000L  public static final void mainString[] args      System.out.printlnLoop without try catch loopWithoutTryCatchLOOPS     System.out.printlnLoop with try catch loopWithTryCatchLOOPS   public static long loopWithoutTryCatchlong loops      long startTime  System.currentTimeMillis      for long i  0L i lt loops i              doSomething           return System.currentTimeMillisstartTime   public static long loopWithTryCatchlong loops      long startTime  System.currentTimeMillis      for long i  0L i lt loops i              try              doSomething          catch Exception e                     return System.currentTimeMillisstartTime   public static void doSomething      for int i  0 i lt 250 i              if i  3  0                      i                 codepre  pAnd I received the following output p  precodeLoop without try catch 375 Loop with try catch 373 codepre  pI was surprised so I tested it again and again, but I always got similar results, both ways it runs pretty much in the same time. p  pAnd now my question is Whyp  pI dont really understand it, as far as I know trycatch writes the resources before usage in some kind of table to later  if any exception is thrown  be able to clean it up and reference to the values it had before the exception occured. p  pThis should take at least some time, shouldnt it  I thought it is maybe because I the random example I choose doesnt represent it properly, and in that specific case in which I tested it it doesnt slow down anything, but that seemed very unlikely to me. p  pThen I thought maybe it just takes such a tiny amount of time that it isnt noticable with that few amount of executions, so I ran the test program again with a total number of 10 million loopings, but what I found just prooved what I had already found It takes pretty much the same time for both executions.p  pSo is there any logical explanation for that this is the case or just a examplespecific behaviour of trycatch p  pThanks for any clarification in advance.p

Negative 2579 pI have a naive question about the highprecision number conversion in C here. p  pSuppose the user assigns 0.1 to the double variable xd with this statement, p  pxd 0.1, p  pIt is known that  xd thus obtained is no more exactly 0.1, due to the inevitable machine rounding. p  pI wonder whether we still have a way to get back the original highly precise string 0.1,  from the double variable xd Clearly, it is useless to use codestdtostring xdcode here. Even a high precision library like boostmultiprecision or MPFR seem to be helpless. For example,  codestdtostringboostcppdecfloat10000xd code cannot recover back the lost precision. p  pSo my question is, can we retrieve back the string 0.1 from a double xd that is assigned using the statement codexd0.1code Thank you for your ideas. p

My plan was to store the whitelist in constant or shared memory, and then have each thread run a Binary Search using this shared whitelist.p  pThen I read about things like bank conflicts, where threads are slowed down because theyre accessing memory on the same bank, which causes a serialization of access to occur.p  pIs a binary search going to result in a larger performance loss on OpenCL due to issues like this Would I be better off with some other search algorithm, like a hashp  pstrongEditstrong Let me clarify my program a bitp  pEach thread will do a parralel calculation, but with a different input value.

Negative 2579 pI have my Arduino Yun set up with a web server. The webpage has a series of buttons on it, which control the buzzer playing various sounds, and a button to control a a hrefhttp42bots.comtutorials28byj48steppermotorwithuln2003driverandarduinouno relnofollowstepper motora. Im using the code linked which uses the AccelStepper library.p  pThe button works fine for the buzzer, I click it and it plays the sound. For the motor however, I click the button, and the LED lights up on the driver board for a second after the button is clicked but thats it.p  pI suspect that the motor, unlike the buzzer, needs the command to be true all the time while it moves to its position, otherwise it stops. So the button on the webpage needs to act more like a switch  click to come on and stay on, click again to go off and stay off. But Im unsure how to do this.p  pOr else, perhaps anyone has experience with this stepper motor and knows how to use it without accelstepper. All im trying to do is get the motor to turn to a given position.p  pI hope this isnt too confused. Im so close, yet this motor is causing me a massive pain.

The HttpRequest function doesnt return the response html code properly, a hrefhttpi.snag.gy8S5HM.jpg relnofollowI only receive garbagea.br I think issue 2 might be a pointer related issue with the return struct of HttpRequest, but I wasnt able to fix it. br 3.

Negative 2579 pI am currently implementing an comic reader. The comic reader works by loading pages into a FragmentPagerAdapter, and loading the FragmentImageViews into a custom ViewPager. p  pI have implemented some features such as double tap reset zoom , pinch zoom and given the user the ability to move the comic around the view to be able to zoom in on the comic itself. p  pMy current issue is that if the user is to move the comic page around the view too quickly it will change page. I am trying to implement a way to only allow the page to change if the corresponding side of the comic page itself is shown in the view. To clarify this I am trying to implement a restriction on page changing, so that the page will only change if the side of the comic image is visible on the screen. So if the user is currently looking at a panel on the far left side of the comic page, moving around the page to the right will move the comic around the current child of the viewpager and not change to the next page. p  pSo far i have the view itself, the adapter, and the viewpager accessable, but not sure how to proceed next.p  precodeOverride  public boolean onInterceptTouchEventfinal MotionEvent ev       if placement of current view is in the correct place       trying to retrieve current view      if a  null          a  FragmentPagerAdapter this.getAdapter           currentImageNo  this.getCurrentItem     final View v  this.getChildAtcurrentImageNo      switch ev.getAction      case MotionEvent.ACTIONDOWN         downX  ev.getX     case MotionEvent.ACTIONUP          upX  ev.getY          final float deltaX  downX  upX           if deltaX gt 0 ampamp deltaX gt SWIPEMINDISTANCE              have view , motion event , adapter               swipe right               make right side of image is further left than the side of the viewer              ...                return super.onInterceptTouchEventev                  if deltaX lt 0 ampamp deltaX gt SWIPEMINDISTANCE               have view , motion event , adapter               swipe left              need to check that the side of the image is on the screen then call                 ...              return super.onInterceptTouchEventev                   return false  codepre  pAny and all guidance welcome.p

This works only on tab with suggested or simmilar products, then when i click on add to cart in listed simmilar products it adds to cart over ajax.

Negative 2579 pI am making an application to secure barcodes so the patients at hospitals cant read them. But i want to hear your perspective on it.p  pFirst of all im making this program in C.p  pMy idea is to make a barcode and secure it for patients at hospital for a application which i am developing secret sorry guys.p  pThe way i am going to secure it is to get the following information about the patients.p  ul liTheir unique ID nr its possible in Denmark to do thatli liTheir room nr which they are staying atli liTheir Patient nr the patients have a specific patient numberli ul  pThe unique ID nr is containing 10 chars. The room nr contains 2 digits and the Patient nr contain 10 digits.p  pIf I am predefining each chars and digits to random numbers and letters, and if I for example take 1 char from the ID nr and generate it to 5 chars in my secured code or maybe after I have generated the new code I will secure it afterwards with a AES code or something, would that be a good way to secure the barcode, so the patient cant read the BarCode and get information of it p  pThe problem is that the patient must not scan the other patients barcode and retrieve information out of it, because that will be a big problem. p

Negative 2579 pIm trying to learn some basic concepts of Android development on Eclipse and while creating some simple applications I started having problems with the way Libraries work.p  pWhen I first installed Eclipse and crated a first app following a guide, it worked fine, but after the second project, everything I run crashes on start even if its a blank application.p  pThe only difference I could find at first was that on the project that would work, the libraries androidsupportv7appcompat.jar and androidsupportv4.jar are on the Android Private Libraries folder, and when I start another project I have to add those libraries manually from the adt bundle folder, but they appear as Referenced Libraries, wich I assume is causing the applications to crash by reading the logs the errors mention those library names.p  pHow can I get the Libraries in the Android Private Libraries folder Or maybe what else could be causing thisp  precode1130 140113.386 ETrace13741 error

Negative 2579 pIt is my first time asking here, sorry if i do something wrong also not in my mother tongue.p  pRecently, i moved from SwingampAWT to JavaFX.p  pI am discovering the new Table which is quite different from the Swing version. Better i would say, it needs less operation and do more things, but ... lord, its way more difficult to understand p  pI am currently trying to modify the TableView dynamically. While the addColumn method is not a big challenge, i need help for my deleteColumn method p  pLets talk about my problem p  pI have a scene with many components on it panes, buttons, menus, ... and one pane actually an anchorpane hosts a TableView.p  pI would like to dynamically delete an entire column when this operation occurs  The user right clicks on the TableView  a contextual menu shows up  he selects the item deletep  pSo, basically a contextual menu that offers the option to delete the column where the user rightclicked.p  pI tried this p  p When the user rightclicks on the TableView, this method is called p  precodepublic void setTargetForContextContextMenuEvent event     ifevent.getTarget instanceof Label         ObservableList list Labelevent.getTarget.getChildrenUnmodifiable         activeColumn  TextObservableListlist.getText     ... codepre  pAnd the goal was to set the column name in activeColumn.p  pThen, when the user will select the delete option from the contextual menu, another method would be called to compare the name of the columns and delete the right one.p  pBut it seems that i cant call a getChildren method on the label, only an unmodifiable one. And it does not allow a cast and throw the exception.p  pDo you have a solution to allow me to get the column name p  pOr maybe i am going the wrong way and i have to find another way to delete the rightclicked column, but in this case i will need your help too.p  pThanks a lot for reading, and thanks in advance for your help.p

Negative 2579 pGiven we need to compress and encrypt some file, process it and then decompress and decrypt it.  It is a typical task, but our file is too big to process with one thread or even one computer. We need to split the file for parallel processing. It can be processed by several threads or by several MapReduce tasks. The problem is how can we deal with the compression and encryption of the file which is split.p  pFor example, we have a huge file to be read and processed by several MapReduce tasks. The file is compressed and encrypted. Is there any codecs and encryptors, capable of decompressing and decrypting only a PART of the file that ships to some MapReduce tasks So that the encrypted and compressed file can be emdirectlyem split between the MapReduce tasks or threads. p  pAnother situation is when you process some huge file separated into several parts, and you compress and encrypt the parts separately from each other with some MapReduce tasks or threads, and finally you need to merge the parts. A question is whether you need to decompress and decrypt the parts of the file for merge, or you can do it directly with the help of some sophisticated codec or encryptorp

Negative 2579 pI have hosted an application in the server by using IIS7.5, which contains the certain download and upload functionality for excel file.The application is prepared on MVC4 and Im using ajax to call the upload functionality from view to controller apart from this I have used a java script file upload plugin. everything worked fine in the Local System, but after hosting the upload functionality had a random behavior , sometime its gets uploaded normally and some time it doesnt and continues the process to run till infinite time till the session expires.p  pI have also noticed that the issue occurs mostly when I try to upload the file immediately after downloading the template.and when I reupload the same file after some time it gets uploaded as it was suppose to. The Upload is also successful when we Refresh the page before uploading.p  pPlease help me in finding the issue. Thanks in advance. It doesnt seems to be code issue hence Im not attaching the code.If anyone still needs it then please let me know.p

Negative 2579 pI am trying to work with the Google Project Tango tablet, I currently am sending data from my tablet to Epics Unreal Engine 4 and trying to visualize it properly. The orientation of the cloud data however is having consistent issues lining up with the orientation of the Tangos pose data.p  pCurrently I am taking the pose from the same frame as the xyzIj data, but the resulting point clouds never line up quite right. I tried doing manual rotation and correction of the cloud data so that it matched up with the pose data, however the solution to rotating one set of xyzIj data does not correct the remaining sets either.p  pI am currently under the assumption that the poses I am using to match these sets are in error, but I am unsure as to how to find the correct one.  I also find that using getPoseAtTime tends to produce similarly flawed results, but that may have something to do with the fact that I dont quite understand its usage.p  pIs there a solution to this issue outside of hand correcting each data set that I have failed to realize, or does everyone deal with similar issuesp

Negative 2579 pI have 2 applications, one written in C and the other in JAVA. Lets call these applications C and JAVA.p  ol liC Creates a named pipe via mkfifo have also tried mknod  no difference to the outcomeli liC forks off with the child process invoking a system call to fireup the JAVA application, passing to it, the name of the FIFO file. IE systemnameofjavaapp nameoffifofileli liC parent opens the FIFO for write onlyli ol  pJAVA opens the FIFO for read.p  ol liC sends a handshake message to the FIFO via write.li liJAVA receives handshakeli liC then tries to send subsequent messages to JAVA, via the FIFO.li ol  pHere is where it get weird. Unless C closes not removes the FIFO FD or if the parent process terminates, JAVA will not read from the FIFO. If C sends handshake then closes, all is well and as expected. If C then reopens the FIFO, sends a message to JAVA then C closes, JAVA will read it.p  pFrom all of the examples of FIFO between C and JAVA that I have studied, they only include a single transfer of data. IE, open, writeread, close but not a continuing stream from source to destination, as I require.p  pImplementing an open, readwrite, close at each end works but surely, there must be a bettermore efficient method  more congruent to the ethos of pipes. If so, I would greatly appreciate any inputp

Negative 2579 pIm using the EC2 load balancer. Since Im implementing my own autoscaling policy, I will not use to auto scaling EC2 service that I imagine is well integrated with the Load Balancer. Basically I will scale out istances all from the same AMI. I notice that the load balancer ask to specify all the instances ids whose workload have to be balanced. My question is it is possible to instruct the load balancer to automatically distribute the workload among all the instances belonging to a given AMI In this way every time my scaling system scale out an instance of the given AMI, I dont need to add the new instance to the load balancer configuration. I search about this on google, but I didnt find any useful information. There is maybe something Im misunderstanding about the load balancer usage Because to me it seems to be a quite common feature a load balancer should have. Maybe apply balancing over a given AMI would cause some problems I cannot see Thank you all in advance for the help.p

Negative 2579 pIn a solution I am working on, in a sub project I have added a reference to another project.  After adding the reference, I was able to successfully add the using statement and have the autocomplete pick up the right extension I was looking for.  The code wrote as usual, but when I compiled, I get the error p  blockquote   pThe type of namespace name Name1 does not exist in the namespace Name2 are  you missing an assembly referencep blockquote  pSo I have searched the forums, I have added several other system references and I have gotten nothing.  I ran NuGet to update the solution packages, and that didnt make a difference either.  For some reason, when I add the reference using the add reference popup GUI the reference to Name1 doesnt have a dll file in it.  If I browse to the dll file directly, it still gives me the same issue when compiling.  Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 2579 pI have an app that loads content from a database as well as images from the internet. I am using a codeRecyclerViewcode along with codeCardViewcode to display my content in a list form. p  pEach row has an image on the left side and text on the right.  The problem is that the text loads fast but the image takes time to load, so I want the image to continue loading in the background and then load into the codeImageViewcode object once loading is complete. I have no idea how to tackle this.p

Negative 2579 pThe current site I am supporting is going to become eCommerce. And naturally they need a shopping cart to support it. There will be some sophistication in the sense that they would need to support multiple currencies, multiple languages, delivery methods, subscription models et al.p  pHowever they are not a market place, so they do not really care about multiple vendors or multiple store fronts. p  pSince the site is in PHP, I looked at a few like xcart, opencart, magisto community edition and prestoshop. The dilemma I have is that the current site management is emveryem particular about design, and most of these shopping cart implementations seem tough to me to customize to the level they would want.p  pThe alternative is to write a custom cart, which is a waste of time amp effort since we are reinventing the wheel which has already been reinvented a gazillion times. p  pI want to leverage what the open source community has to give. I feel that the middle path is there is a good package available ONLY as a classmodulebackend  without the front end UI so that I can start using it and building it how I want.p  pHow does the PHP community approach this problem. From a solution implementation perspective, is it better to build one from scratchp  pI am not sure if anything like that exists, though. I would appreciate anyone who can point me to any online resources that will help me in my quest. p  pThank you.p

Negative 2579 pI have three projects in my solution. So I moved my entity model to a separate project class library so it will be easily accessibly by other solutions.p  pHowever, after this moving, I get the following error upon using the codeusingcode statement for running queries on my modelp  blockquote   pXXX type used in a using statement must be implicitly convertible to   System.IDisposablep blockquote  pWhen I look at the solutions, they say that you should reference EntityFramework in your project.

Negative 2579 pBefore I start, I want to tell that I am new to building RESTful APIs and also have never dealt with any authentication. p  pI want to setup a main server which will get API requests from client let the server IPDomain be, api.example.com. I want to be able to use POST request to send a file to the server with an API key. What are the ways that I could authenticate the API key in the main server and then POST the file again from there to another server depending on the API key like two categories 0 and 1p  pIf the file is publicly available on client server, is it good if I just send the url to the main server which passes it to the second server and then download the file there  Once that is done, the client will also have to use a GET request.p  pI am thinking of having wordpress on main server to make registrations easy write a plugin to generate api to each user. Is it a good idea  p  pI have seen this  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11830338webapicreatingapikeysWeb API creating API keysap  pBut the client side will be public all the client side services I will write will be open source and the api itself is open for developers to develop for their own need. So I figured hashing the key with any method can be reversed because its public. I just want to use a single API key around 30 characters and their email and match it in main server.p  pEDITp  pI just figured out something, but i dont know if its a good strategy. If I could ask the users to add the domain from which the will make the request, and then just have only one API key and send it to the server so the server could match between the APIKey and the Domain and if it is listed continue with the POST.p
Negative 2579 pi want some help please, I made this android app that just makes sums as the Fibonacci sequence, but beginning in two numbers read by editTexts. In each sum may happen a mistakeIt happen randomly, because of that, there is a check button.p  pIm showing each result and verification in a different TextView and i think im doing it in a clumsy way, i want to minimize and optimize this code, all advices are welcome Thanksp  pjava classp  precodepublic class ejer2 extends Activity implements View.OnClickListener  int errorcont private

Negative 2579 pI was taking a look at a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5881169whatcolumntypelengthshouldiuseforstoringabcrypthashedpasswordinadthis questiona regarding the field length and type to use for bcrypt hashes. Several the answers mention using the codeBINARYcode MYSQL column type. However, when reading from this column with the mysql node.js module, it reads BINARY columns into a buffer type rather than a string. The bcrypt compare function codebcrypt.comparepassword, hash, callbackcode does not like the buffer typep  precodeError data and hash must be strings     at nodemodulesbcryptbcrypt.js15016 codepre  pThis leads me to two questionsp  pFirst, I assume that what I want to do is codehashbuffer.toStringcode, but I notice in a hrefhttpsnodejs.orgapibuffer.htmlbufferbuftostringencodingstartend relnofollowthe documentationa that there are different character encodings that can be used. Im not sure what the correct encoding to use is since the data doesnt really represent actual characters. Since I want the binary data to remain unchanged, I would guess ASCII. Can anyone confirm thisp  pSecond, I dont understand why not to use the codeCHARcode data type. The hash is specifically made to be a printable string. I understand that the MYSQL comparisons might not be made as expected, but there is no appropriate time to search for or sort by a password hash anyways.p
Negative 2579 pNondeterministic read caused by concurrent write can be demonstrated by the following codep  precodeclass Bar    int val   stdmutex m  public   explicit Barint v  valv     int val      stdlockguardltstdmutexgt lm     return val       void setint v      stdlockguardltstdmutexgt lm     val  v       class Foo    Bar bar  public   explicit FooBar bar  barbar    int val const  return bar.val    Bar bar1 Foo fooampbar cout ltlt foo.val ltlt endl   1 bar.set2   probably executed in another thread cout ltlt foo.val ltlt endl   2 codepre  pI am interested to know what are the design patterns  coding practices to avoid such problem. p  pOne solution I can think of is to make a deep copy, i.e. Foo will have a consistent snapshot of data it depends on, so all reads will get the same result. If Foo owns Bar, we can make Bar ref counted, and let Foo maintain a list of different versions of Bar all mutation to Bar go through Foo, and client only get a snapshot view of Foo which only have access to one version of Bar, i.e. a consistent view. However, if Foo does not own Bar, it becomes a mess and I cannot think of a good solution here.p  pMy opinion is that either the data owner needs to provide versioned access, or there must be a policy enforcing that no write should happen before reader releases the data.p

Negative 2579 pSpring Security can be a nightmare for the new user.  Nothing is solid, everything can be configured by some codeAutowiredcode bean or other, there are a million options, and seemingly simple things become very complex very quickly.p  pltEnd of Rantgtp  pNow then, I have the following requirements and setup for a corporate intranet applicationp  p1 I am trying to avoid the use of security.xml and configure everything with java annotations.p  p2 There is a central corporate cookiebased authentication service which authenticates the user as someone entitled to use the corporate intranet. Usernames and Passwords are handled there, the application does not concern itself with them. There is a wealth of other information there, most of which my application doesnt need.  The one absolute essential there is the userid entered by the user and validated by the service.  This goes into the Principal and also is available as session data.  This service is supplied as a servlet filter.  p  p3 This filter includes a configuration option through which an adaptor can be attached, to perform other tasks, such as getting the authenticated users applicationspecific roles from an applicationmaintained database.  I am using such an adaptor for this task, which adds the roles from the database to an object that winds up in the Session attributes in some structure. By the end of this filters and adaptors execution the users applicationspecific roles are in the session data. p  p4 I have added a class derived from codecom.att.voicetone.cwing.security.AbstractSecurityWebApplicationInitializercode and in its codebeforeSpringSecurityFilterChaincode method, have registered this filter from step 2 which includes the adaptor from step 3 so that it is done first.  All the above is working as I want it to work.p  p5 Now, I am looking at how all this may be tied into Spring Security.  My goal is to be able to use something like thisp  precodeOverride protected void configureHttpSecurity http throws Exception       http.authorizeRequests         .antMatchersindex.html,transcripts.html.hasRoleMYAPPUSER     http.authorizeRequests         .antMatchersassign.html,report.html.hasRoleMYAPPADMIN     http.authorizeRequests         .antMatchers, x, audio.hasRoleMYAPPUSER     http.authorizeRequests         .antMatchersoam.hasRoleMYAPPADMIN   codepre  pIt seems as though what I must do is implement a class that extends codeorg.springframework.security.web.authentication.preauth.AbstractPreAuthenticatedProcessingFiltercode, and insert it into the filter chain and somehow code it to translate the role information into a format that the codehasRolecode calls above will find the information they are looking for.p  pBut this is the point, after all the hard work has seemingly been done, where I run into countless ConfigurationBuilders, AuthenticationManagers, AuthenticationTokens, etc., all of which have many customization opportunities, none of which seem to fit with the simple task I feel is waiting for me, somewhere, in the morass of configurable options, that I havent been able to find through hours of starting at code, javadocs, etc.p  pIf youve followed me thus far, what is the sweet spot I am missing for translating the roles from the above session object so that SpringSecurity can handle them with the codehasRolecode codep  pOr to put it another way, where is codehasRolecode looking and what does it expect to find therep

Negative 2579 pWe have a business process that takes in a string, and based on one of a few criteria makes some modification to the string and then returns it.
