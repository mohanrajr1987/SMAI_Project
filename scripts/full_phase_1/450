Positive 450 pSo I started writing a template in C using XMacros and had the desire to use Generic to overload them. Problem is that would require extending a macro. I know I cant have a selfreferential macro. And I believe I cant expand the definition of a macro like I would wish. I know I could use other techniques and be done with the code like flipping my node insideout and use containerof but Ill eventually have the same problem when implementing typeof so I figured it would be best to solve it now if possible.p  pA toy example of what I wish would work isp  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt  void aint xprintfan void bchar xprintfbn  define matx Genericx, int ax define tempx matx define matx Genericx, char bx, default tempx  int mainvoid          int x     matx      codepre  pstrongIs there any way to accomplish this redefinition or something equivalent If not is there a way to do it in a POSIX compliant way M4, sh, otherstrongp  pFor answers This code pattern seems generally useful in C11 so only using C if possible. I really hate most preprocessors so if its not the CPP then its definitely my last choice.p
Positive 450 pWe have an app that we want uploaded to a site with a different app id based on the the environment its being built in.

Positive 450 pI picked up a project done by another programmer in C under Linux and Im trying to figure out why I get Segmentation Fault when using preprocessor macro with 16 ASCII char array but not when using less or more than 16.p  pThe macro definition p  precodedefine funca,b  char pa char rb whilep p  r  while0 codepre  pand in the code it is used like this p  precodechar str1[16]   0xBD, 0x71, 0x27, 0xF4, 0xB1, 0x24, 0xF7, 0xA0, 0xC4, 0x78, 0x84, 0xBE, 0x79, 0xC1, 0x85, 0x39  char str2[19]   0x70, 0x06, 0xBE, 0x92, 0x7E, 0xB6, 0x8F, 0x52, 0x5D, 0x42, 0x40, 0x8A, 0x01, 0x48, 0x19, 0xCF, 0xE7, 0xF1, 0x80  func1str1,str2 codepre  pBasically that macro shifts each character from str1 with the value of character from same position in str2. Due to the fact that it works with unsigned chars even when, by shifting, it gets negative value it returns modulus of it returning the correct char.p  pSo the issue is not with shifting and the value obtained after shifting is with the size of the string.p  pIf I use str1 of size 1 to 15 or 17 to 90 ASCII chars it works without any issues but when str1 is equal with 16 ASCII chars I get Segmentation fault.p  pIve converted the macro to a function and it works OK even with 16 ASCII chars.p  pAny ideas why this behavior p  pThank youp

Positive 450 pGood Day All,    First, Thank you all for the great postings within this forum.  I was able to create a VBS Macro yesterday by reading the great questions and answers.    I am extremely new to working with VBS in Visio 2010.  A little background, I am an engineer and am now constantly working with very large visio drawings where all shapes are populated with shape data.  Due to security reasons, some of the easy ways to delete the shape data when refreshing are not available for use.  I worked on a VBS script yesterday and finally was able to get a Macro to search the shape data of the object I selected and delete the field I asked it to do.  My only problem is that since I was utilizing different pieces of code from this forum, I dont know how to perform the final step.br    The Macro currently is deleting upwards of 27 shape data fields and the code I got to work opens a Sheet Window for every field it deletes and leaves it open.  What I want it to do is after it deletes the field, it closes the Sheet Window.  Below is the code I am utilizing.p  precodeSub DeleteShapeData Dim selectObj As Visio.Shape  If ActiveWindow.Selection.Count  0 Then     MsgBox You must select a shape first.

Negative 450 pIm  trying to design an application to hold academic reference information.

Negative 450 pSuppose I have a file, urls.txt, that contains a list of URLs Im monitoring.  My monitoring script edits that file occasionally, say, to indicate whether each URL is reachable.

How can I allow that such that I dont have to think about it when manually editing  p  pHere are some possible answers.  What would you dop  ol lipEngage in hackery like having the program check for the lockfiles that vim or emacs create.  Since this is just for me, this would actually work.pli lipIf the human edits always take precedence, just always have the human clobber the programs changes eg, ignore the editors warning that the file has changed on disk.  The program can then just redo its changes on its next loop.  Still, changing the file while the user edits it is not so nice.pli lipNever let a human touch a file that a program makes ongoing modifications to.  Rethink the design and have one file that only the human edits and another file that only the program edits.pli lipGive the human a custom tool to edit the file that does the appropriate file locking.  That could be as crude as locking the file and then launching an editor, or a custom interface perhaps a simple command line interface for insertingchangingdeleting entries from the file.pli lipUse a database instead of a flat file and then the locking is all taken care of automatically.pli ol  pNote that I concocted the URL monitoring example to make this more concrete and because what I actually have in mind is perhaps too weird and distracting  this question is strictly about how to let humans and programs both modify the same state file.p

Negative 450 pI have been developing a custom flash player in flex for use in a web site. I am running into a strange issue and was wondering if I could get some help. I use an hslider component for video navigation. The problem I am running into is when I drag the slider to another point in the video it is not precisely setting the video play head time. I have videoPlayer.playHeadTime  slider.value. For example slider.value  72.11143423 when I set videoPlayer.playHeadTime to that value I get something like this videoPlayer.playHeadTime76.3413222. A completely different number and it varies each time you navigate at how far off it is. All of my code seems to be correct, and every example online seems to follow the same way of doing this. I am not sure why flash is behind the scenes rounding this number but its causing choppy navigation and several other issues with other functions I have for the player. Any help or advice would greatly be appreciated.p  pThank youp

Negative 450 pIm a bit puzzled here. I did a form containing a simple datagridview containing data from an MDB file.

At this point, Ive done everything from scratch in this order, added a datagridview and added a database connection with the wizard when connecting the datagridview to a database. Only this time around I created an SQL connection instead. p  pAnd Visual Studio created MainTableTableAdapter, DBDataSet, DBDataSet.MainTable.p  pThe SQL server is something which was installed automatically when installing Visual Studio and it does seem to work after creating the table adapter and dataset if theres data in it. In some time I plan to use an SQL Server on the internet which hosts the dataset. So I want to be able to easily edit the source. p  pThe only thing missing now is how to add a row, delete selected row and editing selected row via my own textboxes. More like a fillin form. Any ideas to put me in the right direction Ive tried googling it and Ive found some stuff, but most of it contains stuff on how to create the datasets and etc. And Im not sure what Visual Studio has done automatically. And I want to update everything just as easily as I did with these three lines of code when I used a local MDB file. p

Negative 450 pstrongAre we doing it wrongstrongp  pA colleague and I are messing around with an ASP.NET page to act as a portal to view the results from a diagnostic program on a UniData server. Although we do the oddjob of ASPASP.NET at work, it is not our primary language.p  pTo access this server, we have to use UniObjects, which is an API for authenticating and using the UniData server.p  pWe needed each user visiting the website to have to authenticate with UniData and get their own session via the UniObjects library, then be able to use it without signing in again unless the session isnt used with in x minutes.p  pstrongThe method we have come up with is as followsstrongp  pWe have a singleton with a Hashtable. It maps Windows username with a session object.p  pIf the user goes to our page and username doesnt exist in the Hashtable, it redirects to a login page where the session object is created and added to the Hashtable if authentication succeeds. Otherwise, it grabs the users existing session object from the Hashtable and uses that for the request unless it has expired, in which case we remove it and redirect to the login page.p  pEach session object which is a wrapper object for stuff from UniObjects has a lastUsed method. We need to cleanup users sessions since we have license restrictions on users logged into the UniData server, so every time a user gets redirected to the signin page, it checks if any sessions have not been used in x mins, in which case it closes that session and removes it from the Hashtable. It is done here so users wont experience any delay related to checking all sessions on every request, only at login.p  hr  pSomething is telling me that this solution smells, but I dont have enough ASP.NET experience to work out what we should be doing Is there a better method for doing this or is it actually okayp

Negative 450 pWhats the most efficient way to calculate the byte length of a character, taking the character encoding into account The encoding would be only known during runtime. In UTF8 for example the characters have a variable byte length, so each character needs to be determined individually. As far now Ive come up with thisp  precodechar c  getCharSomehow String encoding  getEncodingSomehow  ... int length  new Stringnew char[]  c .getBytesencoding.length codepre  pBut this is clumsy and inefficient in a loop since a codenew Stringcode needs to be created everytime. I cant find other and more efficient ways in the Java API. Theres a a hrefhttpjava.sun.comjavase6docsapijavalangString.htmlvalueOf28char29codeStringvalueOfcharcodea, but according its source it does basically the same as above. I imagine that this can be done with bitwise operations like bit shifting, but thats my weak point and Im unsure how to take the encoding into account here p  psubiIf you question the need for this, check a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2725897reversemassivetextfileinjava27259932725993this topica.isubp  hr  pstrongUpdatestrong the answer from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2726071efficientwaytocalculatebytelengthofacharacterdependingontheencoding27262842726284Bkkbrada is technically the most efficientp  precodechar c  getCharSomehow String encoding  getEncodingSomehow CharsetEncoder encoder  Charset.forNameencoding.newEncoder  ... int length  encoder.encodeCharBuffer.wrapnew char[]  c .limit codepre  pHowever as a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comusers139985stephencStephen Ca pointed out, there are more problems with this. There may for example be combinedsurrogate characters which needs to be taken into account as well. But thats another problem which needs to be solved in the step embeforeem this step.p
Negative 450 pThe version information, displayed when the mouse cursor hovers over the file in windows explorer, is set for a file built by visual studio in the VERSION resource.  I would like to set the version in one place for all the files built by a solution, preferably when I change the version in the install properties.  Is there a way to do thisp  pThe motivation for this is that if the version is not updated for a file, then the installer will leave previous versions of files instead of replacing them with new files.  This happens even when the RemovePreviousVersions property is set.  In order to save the tedious and error prone task of updating the version in every file built and installed, I remove the version resource from all files  which is not elegant.p

Negative 450 pim using Eclipse 3.6 for CC for Linux. I need to compile existing project with my own working makefile.

I unchecked the switch Generate Makefile automatically in Project Properties  CC Build, and instead of many errors got this emem commands commence before first target.  Stop.p  pMay be this project was not imported correctly into Eclipse I know there is such a thing as Standard Make project which will not create makefile automatically but needs my own makefile, but in Eclipse IDE under File New C Project there is no Standard Make project options available.

Negative 450 pI am interested in how others have done Prism and Click Once.p  pSpecifically, if you have a moduledll that is used in several applications, how do you handle deployment of an update to that moduledll  Do you have to open up each application and hit Publishp  pAlso, sometimes, my Prism app does not have references to all the dlls that it uses.  It will just import them via the ModuleCatalog from a file.  Because the project does not see those dlls as references it does not put them in to deploy them.  How do you tell click once to deploy random dlls  p  pTo address the above issue I tried adding all the dlls I was using as a reference to my Shell Project.  But it when I do a build does not even copy all of them to the output directory because it cannot see them being directly used.  This happens most when a module is only used via IEventAggregator.  This of course means that when I do a Publish those dlls are missing.p  pSo, am I able to use Click Once for Prism  Or is it too limited  Is there a better wayp  pAny advice is appreciated.p

In respect to the simple program above, this is what Id like to be able to do where codeCgtcode represents the imagined prompt p  precodeCgt include ltstdio.hgt stdio.h included Cgt int a2 Cgt printfHello World dn, a Hello World 2  Cgt  codepre  pIn other words, Id like to be able to execute individual C commands interactively emIm guessing this would represent onthefly compilation of sortsem. Initially I was misled by the name of the a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiCshell relnofollowC shella codecshcode  but I dont think it will be able to execute C commands on the fly. p  pSo, first and foremost, Id like to know if it is possible somehow to persuade, say, codegdbcode to perform in this manner If not, is there anything else that would allow me to do something similar some special shell, maybe p  pAs for the context  I have some code where I have problems troubleshooting pointers between structs and such here the way a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3311182linuxceasyprettydumpprintoutofstructslikeingdbfromsourcecodgdb can printout structsa works very well  however, to isolate the problem, I have to make new source files, paste in data, compile and debug all over again. In this case, Id much rather have the possibility to paste several structs and their initialization commands in some sort of a shell  and then, inspect using codeprintfcode or even better, something akin to codegdbcodes codeprintcode typed directly on the shell. p  pJust for the record  Im not really persuaded something like this really exists but I thought Id ask anyways  p  pThanks in advance for any answers,br Cheers nbspbr nbsp  p  pstrongEDITstrong I was a bit busy, so havent had time to review all answers yet for accept sorry   just wanted to add a little comment reeminterpreted vs. machine codeem or as mentioned by doronp  blockquote   pThe problem with running C C source interactively is that    the compiler is not able to perform line by line interpretation of the code. p blockquote  pI am fully aware of this  but lets imagine a command line application could even be an interpreted one, that gives you a prompt with a command line interface. At start, lets assume this application generates this simple text file in memoryp  precodeHEADER  int main      MAIN      return 0   codepre  pThen, the application simply waits for a text to be entered at the prompt, and ENTER to be pressed and upon a new linep  ul liThe application checks  ul liif the line starts with codedefinecode or codeincludecode, then it is added below the codeHEADERcode  but above the codeint maincode line  in the temp fileli lianything else, goes below codeMAINcode line  but above codereturn 0code line  in the temp fileli ulli lithe temp file is stripped of codeHEADERcode and codeMAINcode lines, and saved to disk as codetemp.ccodeli licodegcccode is called to compile codetemp.ccode and generate codetemp.outcode executable ul liif fail, notify user, exitli ulli licodegdbcode is called to run the codetemp.outcode executable, with a breakpoint set at the codereturn 0code line ul liif fail, notify user, exitli ulli liexecution is returned to the prompt the next commands the user enters, are in fact passed to codegdbcode emso the user can use commands like codep variablecode to inspectem  until the user presses, say, Ctrl1 to exit codegdbcodeli liCtrl1  codegdbcode exits, control is returned to our application  which waits for the next code line all over again.. etc  ul lisubsequent code line entries are kept in the temp file  placed below the last entry from the same categoryli ulli ul  pObviously, I wouldnt expect to be able to paste the entire linux kernel code into an application like this, and expect it to work  However, I would expect to be able to paste in a couple of codestructcodes, and to inspect the results of statements like, say p  precodechar dat  char int16tmygtstructuregtpdata gtgt 32 amp 0xFF  0x88  codepre  p... so Im sure in what is the proper syntax to use which is usually what I mess up with  emwithoutem the overhead of rebuilding and debugging the entire software, just to figure out whether I should have moved a right parenthesis before or after the asterisk sign emin the cases when such an action doesnt raise a compilation error, of courseem. p  pNow, Im not sure of the entire scope of problems that can arise from a simplistic application architecture as above. But, its an example, that simply points that something like a C shell for relatively simple sessionsprograms would be conceptually doable, by also using codegcccode and codegdbcode  without any serious clashes with the, otherwise, strict distinction between machine code and interpreted languages. p

This is of course understandable, and one could argue that I could just make a list of named members to ignore, but unfortunately these predefined attributes are bound to change with different versions of Python therefore making my project volnerable to changed in the python project  and I dont like that.p  pexamplep  precodegtgtgt class A ...   a10 ...   b20 ...   def initself ...     self.c30 gtgtgt dirA [doc, init, module, a, b] gtgtgt getuserattributesA [a,b] codepre  pIn the example above I want a safe way to retrieve only the userdefined class attributes [a,b] not c as it is an instance attribute. So my question is... Can anyone help me with the above fictive function codegetuserattributesclscodep  pP.S. I have spent some time trying to solve the problem by parsing the class in AST level which would be very easy. But I cant find a way to convert already parsed objects to an AST node tree. I guess all AST info is discarded once a class has been compiled into bytecode.p  pBest regards Jakobp

However, if I execute the commands in the coderuncode block of the class meaning the calls are concurrent, as I am hoping for, it appears as if only one input stream is generated, which all codeBufferedReaderscode consume concurrently.p  pTo debug the issue, I output each consumed line on the console prefixed by which instance of my class was reading the input stream.  I expect something like the following, understanding that they may be out of order from instancetoinstance, but the line order of a single instance would be intactp  precodeexec 0 Line1 exec 1 Line1 exec 2 Line1 exec 0 Line2 exec 1 Line2 exec 2 Line2 exec 0 Line3 exec 1 Line3 exec 2 Line3 ... codepre  pWhats strange is I get the expected number of instances of the very first line of the output codeMicrosoft R Windows Script Host Version 5.7code, but after this line, only one process continues to produce data in the input stream, and all readers randomlyconsume this one stream, such as this examplep  precodeexec 2 Microsoft R Windows Script Host Version 5.7 exec 0 Microsoft R Windows Script Host Version 5.7 exec 1 Microsoft R Windows Script Host Version 5.7 exec 0 line2 exec 1 line3 exec 2 line4 ... codepre  pTo make matters worse, the readers stall and codereadLinecode never returns null.  I read that this type of behavior might have something to do with the buffer size, but when I run only two concurrent threads, even with a short output, it still exhibits the same behavior.  Nothing is captured in codestdErrcode to indicate there is a problem.p  pTo see if this was a limitation of the script host, I created a batch file that codeSTARTcodes multiple instances of the script concurrently.  strongI should state this was run emoutsideem of Java, in a cmd shell, and launches several of its own shells.strong  However, each concurrent instance fully returned the expected results and behaved well.p  pstrongEditstrong As another troubleshooting idea, I decided to reenable concurrency, but stagger my initialization method by inserting the following into my codeY.runcode blockp  precodetry     Thread.sleepintMath.random  1200  catch InterruptedException e     System.out.printlnCant sleep   End try initializemonitor codepre  pinto my code.  I begin to see multiple outputs for the first few lines, but it quickly reverts to multiple consumers consuming the same producer, and as soon as the first completed stream closes, the rest of the consumers fire exceptions.  The next consumer fires an codeIOException Read errorcode, and the rest fire codeIOException Stream closedcodep  pAccording to maaartinus, it IS possible to run multiple, concurrent codeInputStreamscode, so now the question becomes what is causing the undesired behavior  How can I independently grab their input streams  I dont want to have to write to a temporary file just to process the data back in, if I can avoid it.p

Negative 450 pIm making what is basically a toolbar that contains a search field and some buttons. Id like for the search field to grow in size just the width when the parent container gets wider, like when the user adjusts the split pane. Currently, the text field and the buttons will remain the same size and whitespace is added on either side as the container is widened. I can achieve this growing effect by using a codeBorderLayoutcode in the container and putting the buttons on codeLINEENDcode and the text field in the codeCENTERcode. The problem I have with this is that the text field now becomes taller than a standard text field and it looks ugly. This behavior makes sense as the codeBorderLayoutcode manager will give all the extra space this includes vertical and hortizontal space to the codeCENTERcode text field. Ive tried to restrict this vertical growth by placing a maximum size on the text field, but codeBorderLayoutcode will not honor it.p  pHeres what Ive gotp  precodefinal JTextField searchField  new JTextFieldEnter your search terms searchField.setMaximumSizenew DimensionInteger.MAXVALUE, 25 final JPanel controls  new JPanelnew BorderLayout controls.addsearchField, BorderLayout.CENTER controls.addnew JPanel     addnew JButtonSearch addnew JButtonIm Feeling Lucky , BorderLayout.LINEEND codepre  pIt would seem that this behavior is a commonly desired one and it should be easy to implement, but Ive had no luck after looking through all the OracleSun tutorials and Google search results. p  pAnybody have any solutions to this I need to stick with standard Java Swing components  no third party libraries please.p  pThank youp

Negative 450 pIm still somewhat new to multithreading so maybe this is an easy answer, but I tried searching around with locks and synchronized methods but this isnt working out right.p  pI have a system which connects to an ftp site and downloads an xml file to process. The application waits until the file on the ftp site is updated, if it isnt updated it doesnt do anything. If it is updated it downloads the xml file to start processing.p  pBefore we process the xml we check the version of a file on the server, and the version of something in the database, if the versions arent the same, create a new thread and update the file on the server to the new version.p  pSo in code its pretty muchp  precodeiffile.version.equalsdb.version     do work...  else     startUpdateThread   private synchronized void startUpdateThread     Runnable updateRunnable  new UpdateRunnable    Thread updateThread  new ThreadupdateRunnable    updateThread.start  codepre  pThe problem Im having is that the xml file will change on the ftp site in the middle of updating the file on the server and still enter the startUpdateThread method and by the time its finished I will have multiple threads trying to accomplish the same tasks.p  pMy question I guess is, why is the syncrhonized method still being called even though it should be locked, and if Im doing it wrong what is the correct way to approach this without creating multiple threads to accomplish the same tasks.p  pstrongeditstrong A little further explanation of the system, the file on the server gets loaded into a cache when the application starts, so the file.version.equals is really from a cache. The file only needs to be regenerated once every few months its something that is done manually that I am going to make automated. p  pThe file on the server and the xml file have nothing to do with each other, it just happens that this check is triggered when the application sees the file on the server has changed which is roughly every two minutes. To generate a new file and load it into cache takes about 10 minutes. So the check happens about 5 times, thus creating 5 threads, regenerating a file.p  pThe desired result isp  pNormal processing to continue with the xml filep  pONE new thread being created to reload a totally seperate file on the server.p  pHopefully that makes better sense...p

Negative 450 pIm using the CheckBoxTree class which is part of the JIDE Common Layer package httpjidesoft.comproductsoss.htm. What Id like to be able to do is save and load the state of the CheckBoxTreeSelectionModel which is what tracks what boxes are checked or not. I can save it by just saving selectionModel.getSelectionPaths, but my problem is with loading it. When I selectionModel.setSelectionPaths it only checks the boxes for the root and the leaf of the path, but nothing in between. Strangely enough, this also happens when I save the results of getSelectionPaths then feed it directly into setSelectionPaths.p  pFor the FileSystemModel, Im using some code I found which likes to use File objects instead of TreeNodes.

Negative 450 pIt is said that when input parameter is null, compareTo should throw a NullPointerException. However, I am implementing a class which needs to compare fields with the type of String. These fields need not to be mandatory. I wonder in this case,p  p1 What should I return when the input is null Should any notnull strings lexicographically bigger or smaller than nullp  pandp  p2 If this is considered bad practice, is there any supporting arguments Should I force the user to use empty strings instead If using empty string, wont that confuse the case in which the field is not applicable and the case in which the field is empty And if exception must be thrown, then except from warning the user in the manual, what else couldshall I dop  pEDIT I might not express myself clearly here, but in the program I am implementing, the strings that could be null are all fields or a class, which should not be null. In other words, the objects comparedTo uses could not be null, just their private fields could be. So in this case, I believe if I implement compareTo properly, it would not violate the transitive requirement since classes with null fields would be considered the same always.

Negative 450 pI have a form which allows one file attachment, and generates an email to a hardcoded address.  I would like to avoid the possibility of malicious users entering custom mail headers a CRLF injection, so called since email headers end in rn as per RFC.p  pSuppose I run the following function on every piece of data which might make it into the a hrefhttpphp.netmailrefsect1function.mailparameters relnofollowadditionalheadersa parameterp  precodeltphp  function stripcrlfstring return strreplacern, n, string   gt codepre  pThat replaces JUST the carriage return half of the CRLF pair.

Negative 450 pI have a CoreData app that imports information from an .xml file. The file has two sections, summary and detail.p  pIn essence, I have two table views, tvSummary and tvDetail two array controllers, acSummary and acDetail and one mutable array, maDetail.p  pI use the code[acSummary addObjectnewSummaryData]code method to add summary data records to the acSummary array controller when I import a file. Once the file is imported the summary data fields populate the tvSummary table view.p  pWhen I use the code[acDetail addObjectnewDetailData]code method to add detail data records to the acDetail array controller it can take upwards of twenty minutes to import up to 72000 records most files contain between 3600 and 21600 records. Once this lengthy process is completed the imported detail data fields populate the tvDetail table view. When I make selections in the tvSummary table view the data displayed in the tvDetail table view changes to match the selected row. I think this is how it is supposed to work.p  pDuring the Cocoa  Objectivec  Core Data learning process I am still a neophyte I have found I can copy 72000 records to the maDetail mutable array in about five seconds. I have also found I can copy the contents of the maDetail mutable array to the acDetail array controller in about two seconds using the code[acDetail setContentmaDetail]code method.p  pWhat I can not figure out is how to get the acDetail array controller to remember the content it was given when I select a different row in the tvSummary table view. I see references to forcing an array controller save, however, I can not find any documentation on how to implement such a method. Any advice or direction would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 450 pI have a table model that Im trying to implement an insertRow functionality. Ultimately, I would like to have the ability to add rows to the table from top so you would not need to scroll down every time you would like to see newly added rows. Im having a hard time trying to figure out how to implement this. Im thinking a map is not going to be very effective because each time I add a new row at position 0 everything else needs to be incremented by 1. So, everytime I add a row I need to push everything down by one. This seems like once a table gets large its going to be very costly. When adding a value to bottom you suinply just update that row.

However, I need to be able to get new data while the chart is reading data.

Every once is a while the data gatherer locks both arrays and copies the write array into the read array.p  pAre there any better ways to do thisp

Negative 450 pIm writing up an online examination site for an educational institution. Time limits can be set for each assessment, and once a user begins an exam, a new timestamp is created on the server. The problem is that our school computers often lock up and students are forced to restart, losing exam time.p  pI figured out I could store the timer as a cookie, but that could easily be compromised. Any suggestions Thanks.p
Negative 450 pI dont know how to ask this so pardon me if I am unclear and please ask me to clarify. I want to center a page and have a side bar on the right within the centered content, not the right of the viewport. This is pretty simple except I want the element to be as tall as the viewport. However, if the body tag is taller, I want it to be as tall as the body tag. I need this because the sidebar has a background that must repeat along the yaxis to cover the entire viewport. I probably didnt explain anything so perhaps this jsFiddle will clear up any missed details.p  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netdHerb relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netdHerbap  pI can set the code.centercode style to have a position value of static which works but then the absolute positioning is thrown off. I could float the sidebar to the right but the height wont fill the page. I could use JavaScript, but JavaScript shouldnt be relied on for layout especially since the element that depends on it is a quarter of the pages content.p  pAny pointer will be much appreciated.p  pEDIT Changing the body and html tag to have a height of 100 helps but it still doesnt quite behave as I described. If there is content out of the viewport and you scroll to that content, the background wont repeat.p

Negative 450 pRecently I watched a lot of Stanfords hilarious a hrefhttpopenclassroom.stanford.eduMainFolder relnofollowOpen Classroomsa video lectures.

Those matrices just contain discrete values of the same range. Lets say I have 1000s of 20x15 matrices that with values ranging from 13.

Negative 450 pI must admit that Im new to Web services.  When I create a Web service using CXF or Axis, even with custom beans being used to communicate information between the client and the service, the objects are automatically marshalled and unmarshalled for me I mean CXF or Axis create all the necessary files and classes.  So, even though I know JAXB is used by the stack to marshal, and unmarshal objects, but I dont directly need to work with JAXB.  p  pNow, my question is whether I need to work with JAXB directly, as far as Web services are concerned, or that marshaling and unmarshalling will always be handled for mep

Negative 450 pI am facing a weird issue with the AVAudioPlayer class with the codeaudioPlayerDidFinishPlayingsuccessfullycode callback not being called emsometimesem.

Whenever the audio playback finishes, and the codeaudioPlayerDidFinishPlayingsuccessfullycode callback is called, the timer will be invalidated. The callback code is,p  precode voidaudioPlayerDidFinishPlayingAVAudioPlayer player successfullyBOOLflag      [self.progressTimer invalidate]     self.progressTimer  nil  codepre  pHowever, occasionally once in 2030 playbacks this callback is not called. Ive added breakpoints and logging calls to verify that this callback method was not called.p  pThe numberOfLoops for playback is set to code0code so it does not repeat.p  pHeres some additional information if it helps. The repeating timer that is being created updates the UI with the current playback progress. Its code looks like,p  precode voidupdatePlaybackProgress      SoundCell soundCell  [self soundCellForCurrentlyPlayingSound]      NSTimeInterval progress  player.currentTime  player.duration     if progress gt 0          soundCell.progress  progress       codepre  pThe completion callback is not called emsometimesem, so the timer is not invalidated and is called after every 16 ms. I logged the values of codeplayer.currentTimecode, and codeprogresscode inside the codeupdatePlaybackProgresscode method, and it seems the playback is looping over and over. The value of codecurrentTimecode keeps increasing from code0.0code to code1.0code, then back to code0.0code and starts over. The audio, however, is only played the very first time, and not continuously as the value of codecurrentTimecode suggests.p  pThis problem has happened for sounds with a duration of 1 second to over 30 seconds.p  pI am out of ideas at this point, and Google and the Apple Developer Forums dont have anything related.p

Negative 450 pSo I have This EJB annotated at class level with codeTransactionAttributeTransactionAttributeType.REQUIREDcode, so that every method should execute in a transaction unless I override this behavior, when the transaction is committed, the data is meant to be flushed, right So far so good. So now I have a codepublic User findString emailcode method, annotated with codeTransactionAttributeTransactionAttributeType.NOTSUPPORTEDcode so this method is not executed in a transaction, as it only fetches data.p  pOk so I am testing my app, and I have a booter method that creates a couple of entities using an ejb and then uses the find method to fetch one. What, in my opinion, should happenp  pI create entity 1 calling codesaveUser ucode which is executed in a transaction. It commits, the data is flushed.p  pRepeat this step with 2 more entities. their transactions commit, the data is flushed.p  pAt this point I should have 3 entities in my L2 cache using Eclipselink and in my database.p  pI call the codefindString emailcode method. It finds an entity, returns it, no exception, and my code executes nicely, I get excited, I open a beer, and I dont need to ask a question in stackoverflow.p  pWhat actually happensp  pI create all 3 entities. No exception.p  pI call the codefindString emailcode method, it raises an EjbException because it doesnt find the entity, debugging I find out that when this method is called, the database is empty, no data has been flushed even if i call the flush method when i create the entities explicitly, which shouldnt be neccessary anyway. It throws the EJbException, my code stops, I check the database again and NOW the entites are there, once the exception was thrown because they werent there. If I remove codeTransactionAttributeTransactionAttributeType.NOTSUPPORTEDcode from the find method, which causes it to execute the search inside a transaction, my code works.p  pI dont open a beer.p  pSo now seriously, whats going on Why do I need to search for the entity inside a transaction otherwise it doesnt flush anythingp  pEDIT Persistence Unitp  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingUTF8gt ltpersistence version2.0 xmlnshttpjava.sun.comxmlnspersistence xmlnsxsihttpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchemainstance xsischemaLocationhttpjava.sun.comxmlnspersistence httpjava.sun.comxmlnspersistencepersistence20.xsdgt   ltpersistenceunit nameTribunalExpedientes transactiontypeJTAgt     ltprovidergtorg.eclipse.persistence.jpa.PersistenceProviderltprovidergt     ltjtadatasourcegttribunalexpedientesltjtadatasourcegt     ltexcludeunlistedclassesgtfalseltexcludeunlistedclassesgt     ltsharedcachemodegtALLltsharedcachemodegt      ltpropertiesgt       ltproperty nameeclipselink.ddlgeneration valuedropandcreatetablesgt      ltpropertiesgt   ltpersistenceunitgt ltpersistencegt codepre  pNo Exception raised except for the one saying that no entity has been found when I search, after which, the cache is flushed to the database.p

Negative 450 pIm currently struggling with the implementation of a set of file system classes. I guess this calls for the composite pattern if Im not mistaken. So I set up the following classesp  pAn abstract class codeNodecode which has a reference to its parent folder and two classes codeFoldercode and codeFilecode that implement codeNodecode. A folder contains a collection of all its children and methods to add and remove children.p  pThe thing is, I cant figure out how to implement all the methods properly. In all the examples I have seen there is no reference to the parent in the children. How can the codeAddChildcode method ensure that the childs parent reference is set correctly I solved that by checking whether codechild.Parentcode has already been set to the folder or it throws an codeArgumentExceptioncode. The matter is further complicated by the fact that codeAddChildcode might also throw an exception like codeDuplicateNameExceptioncode or something. So my methods look like this nowp  precodeFile.AddToFolder folder      this.Parent  folder     try          folder.AddChildthis      catch          this.Parent  null         throw        Folder.AddChildNode child      ifchild.Parent  this         throw new ArgumentException...     ...  codepre  pNow I have this ugly codeAddTocode method and cannot do something like codesomeFolder.AddChildnew File...code. I wonder how it was implemented with codeListViewItemcode for instance. There I can just do codesomeListView.Items.Addnew ListViewItem...code.p  pMy solution works, but Im not convinced that its the right way to do this. Maybe someone has a better solution or can point me to a good example.

Now, however, I realize that the previous commits from the codeabcode branch which should emneverem end up in master, are all in master.  Its...quite the mess.

Negative 450 pThis is a beginners question about web programming. Basically I have a page that shows a default address using the Google Map API.

Negative 450 pIs it possible to disable instrumentation libraries in a Java application, or to check if any are currently runningp  pMy goal is to prevent users from running instrumentation implementations over my application, for security reasons.p  pIve come up with a theoretical solution on my own after some experimentation, in which I discovered that the codejava.class.pathcode system property ends with the path of the javaagent VM argument jar file, after a path separator character.  From this property, I could check if one of the class path attributes is an external jar not specified by my program itself, and then terminate my application if an alien jar is detected.p  pHowever, the above approach seems somewhat hacky to me, but I havent been able to find a way to directly block the javaagent argument, nor a simple way to detect the instrumentation agent libraryies.  Are either of these cleaner alternatives possiblep

My question isp  ol liConsidering SVG and Canvas, which one is better for similar projectsli liSince Canvas only provides a bundle of lowlevel APIs, is there any existing libraries that handle object rendering, layer management, conflict detection, etc. For instance, with wxWidgets, Qt or MFC, developers do not have to care about window overlay and rendering in a window system. Thanks a lot li ol  hr  pUPDATE 2p  pOK, Ive read the posts and Ill try to avoid such kind of questions. Now Ive found out this librarya hrefhttpwww.kineticjs.com relnofollowKineticJSa, which also implements some of the functionalities of SVG.

Moreover, since we are deploying this application to iPad, we are trying to find out an efficient and easytouse technology to build it.

When I inspect the button in my web application with Firebug after setting the UiBinder stylename to style.createButton, it uses some kind of obfuscated class namep  precodeclassGBMSFK0DJJ codepre  pWhen I inspect it after not having assigned any class name at all, it saysp  precodeclassgwtButton codepre  pAlthough the button seems to have the right class name, the style I defined in the UiBinder style section is not applied. Am I missing something or is this a bug p  pIn case you wonder why I dont just assign my own custom style name to the button Im actually trying to style TreeItems by using .gwtTreeItem, but the button class is probably a nicer example.p

Negative 450 pIm working in visual studio 2010 and have included a crystal report in the project. The report includes all products owned by a client. The problem is that there are thousands of clients and I need to print a selected clients information through code. I have tried printing page numbers matching the id of the client, but some clients have more than one page of products, which causes a printout of page... say 100 for the client with an id of 100, but that page might be for client 91 since some reports for prior clients are multiple pages. My question is how would I go about printing a page for a specific client I have been working on this for days and cant find anything helpful on the internet.p  pThanks for any help in advance.p

Negative 450 pMy problem is, that I am running a webapp on Tomcat7 on a 2GB 2Core VPS and when the app crashes with heapoverflow exception Tomcat doesnt start or stop. When I try to access it via the browser it just hangs.p  pIf I try to stop it looks like it stops but if I do it repeatedly it is supposed to throw an exception because its already stopped, but this  is not the case. Only after 15 minutes am I able to start it up again.p  pI know that I should solve the heapoverflow problem, but the thing is I am simply not able as the framework I am using turned out to be nod thread safe and I have to create a new instance of a memory heavy object for every request  I tried to come round the problem by adding some basic controller which only allows certain amount of objects to be created and the rest of the request are redirected to a Sorrypage. Since it is for a UNI project and the main goal is not being able to serve hundreds of users its not important to make the framework thread safe. p  pStill I need to know why Tomcat does it after it crashes. Also it would help if you would have a better idea how to limit the number of these objects being in the memory at the same time.p  pp  pAt the moment the only solution I can see is to get say 2GB of more RAM so I will be able to serve some 1520 users at a time.p

Negative 450 pSimple question. If I use springdata to generate CRUD methods for my DAO layer, should I still write unit tests against the generated methods Or would that be the equivalent of unit testing library codep  pThanks in advance.p  pEDIT To clarify, Im asking whether or not the unit test needs to be written emin addition toem a suite of integration tests that get run before a release. For example, a a hrefhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiUnittest relnofollowunit testa for the findAll method of the DAO layer would be similar to the followingp  precodeclass DepartmentDAOTest extends spock.lang.Specification      ...     def returns all departments         setup        def result  new ListltDepartmentgt        when        result  dao.findAll        then        result.size  EXPECTEDSIZE      codepre  pWhereas an a hrefhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiIntegrationtest relnofollowintegration testa would be run probably by a test team or developer by hand, possibly before tagging a new release. This could either be automated using a hrefhttpjwebunit.sourceforge.net relnofollowJWebUnita or a hrefhttpwww.gebish.org relnofollowGeba, and tests every component including the platform to ensure they work as expected when integrated.p  pIf I were to write the DAO implementation by hand using JdbcTemplate there would be no question that I should unit test every method. When I unit test the service layer which makes calls to the DAO layer I can mock out the DAO layer so I dont test it twice.p  pIf I make a call into a thirdparty library like pdfbox for generating a PDF, theres an expectation for each method to work because it is tested as a part of the pdfbox project. I dont test that their drawSquare method really draws a square, but during integration testing Ill see that my export PDF functionality correctly exports a PDF the way we want it to. p  pSo the question should really be reworded as, Under which testing phase should I test my usage of springdatap
Negative 450 pI just got a project in my Computer Science class. We got the assignment to use a Password Decryption solution provided by our teachers, and adapt it to be used across our network in a MasterSlave relationship.p  pThis means that a Master Server have to contact dormant Slaves Clients. We are kind of confused here, as we want to use multiple slaves to decrypt the encrypted passwords we got, but we cant design a system in which the Server is the one to initiate connection to the clients rather than the clients initiating connection to the server.p  pWe have to send the Slaves a list of Encrypted Passwords and make them send back results by comparing them to an encrypted version of a dictionary.p  pWe discussed treating the Master as a Client and the Slaves as Servers, but this would be a problem since you cant stream to different servers through the same port. You would have to change the ports. If this is the only solution then so be it. Any helpp

Negative 450 pI have an asp.net page with a timer embedded in an UpdatePanel UpdateModeConditional, ChildrenAsTriggersfalse. The timer is responsible for updating some components of that page every few seconds.p  pThere are also some HyperLink controls on the page and they open a JQueryMobile dialog when clicked datareldialog. The problem is that the timer i mentioned causes postback every few seconds. So when a dialog is opened and then closed, the first such postback after then causes the dialog to open once again. p  pUsing the relexternal as another attribute of the HyperLinks I mentioned solves the problem, but this is no solution for me. This causes full redirection to the dialog page instead of showing it using AJAX as if on top of current page.p  pMy idea was to stop the timer when any hyperlink is clicked.

However, I also want to be able to push changes up into myproject, but not yet immediately create a pull request to get them merged into originalproject until my branch is complete and tested.

Negative 450 pI am making use of a third party codeFooClientImplcode Java class, which implements the codeFooClientcode interfacep  precodeinterface FooClient      public FooOutput processFooFooInput inputData  codepre  pwhich processes data passed to it by communicating over a TCP socket on a particular port number on codelocalhostcode to a thirdparty, nonJava codefooservercode process. Each codeinputDatacode instance can be processed standalone i.e its embarrassingly parallel. codefooservercode is rather slow but just runs on a single core, so Id like to be able to manually fire up multiple instances of it on separate ports , and have multiple codeFooClientImplcode instances to access it  one for each server instance. So far this is easy.p  pHowever Id also like to create a codeConcurrentFooClientImplcode class which also implements the codeFooClientcode interface, but under the hood, keeps track of a pool of codeFooClientImplcode instances or subclass instances maybe 8, and processes the incoming data with the first unused instance after the code.processFoocode method is called waiting until one is available if necessary. That way, other code could instantiate codeConcurrentFooClientImplcode and it would look the same to the calling code, only faster.p  pIm very new to threading, and Ive walked through the a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavasetutorialessentialconcurrencyindex.html relnofollowJava Concurrency tutoriala, but this use case seems somewhat different from the examples there. p  pI emthinkem I need to create a codeThreadcode subclass codeFooClientImplThreadcode which wraps a codeFooClientImplcode instance. And I think I also should use a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase6docsapijavautilconcurrentExecutors.html relnofollowcodeExecutors.newFixedThreadPoolcodea to manage a fixedsize pool of clients, and that should maybe have a a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase6docsapijavautilconcurrentThreadFactory.html relnofollowcodeThreadFactorycodea which  produces instances of codeFooClientImplThreadcode. And then in codeConcurrentFooClientImpl.processFoocode I could wrap codeinputDatacode somehow in an implementation of a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase6docsapijavautilconcurrentCallable.html relnofollowcodeCallablecodea to submit them to the pool. But these instances would need to get hold of a particular codeFooClientcode instance so they could in turn call codeFooClientImplThread.processFoocode and actually talk to the codefooservercode running on the appropriate port. I emguessem they could call a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase6docsapijavalangThread.html relnofollowcodeThread.currentThreadcodea and cast the result to codeFooClientImplThreadcode. But intuitively that feels hacky to me although I dont know if  trust my intuition here, and Im not sure whether it would work or whether it is sensible..p  pAm I on the right track with my possible solution here, or is there a  more sane approach I should takep  pstrongUpdatestrong I ended up implementing a solution like the one described. Surprisingly, it mostly worked as expected, except of course I realised I hadnt thought through what would be needed for background processing while maintaining the outwardfacing API. As far as I can tell, this is not possible in the oneatattime callertriggered API I outlined above. It would need to be replaced by a producerconsumer pattern or something, which I ended up doing, albeit in a different way.p

Negative 450 pIm trying to add Gamma correction to my rendering engine. I have two problemsp  p1  Math.pow is REALLY slow relative to being called thousands of times per second. So I will need to create a precalculated gamma table that can be accessed instead of calculating on the fly. This is extra information, not the actual problem.p  p2 Currently, I can only do this by unpacking the integer pixels, applying the gamma through replacing the RGBA channels with their corresponding gamma modified values, and then repacking the pixels and sending it back to the image buffer. The performance hit isnt emterrible...em  but it is knocking a solid 60fps fixed timestep down to around 40fps or so with several images being rendered.p  pI tried implementing the integer unpackingpacking in native code, only to see no performance improvement and get VM crashing probably memory checking errors but I dont really care to fix it now.p  pIs there a way to apply the gamma without unpackingpacking pixels If not, what method would you recommend using to do thisp  pN.B.

Negative 450 pESRI gives access to moving data from tables to arrays and back. I have a script that takes census data from an api call and converts it into arrays, does some simple math, and then, ideally, puts it out into a table.

Negative 450 pI need to access the Server.MapPathvirtualPath method in a controller in an MVC 4  ApiController.p  pThe answer is usually to access it from ControllerContext.HttpContext.Server.  However, unlike MvcControllers, the ControlerContext for an ApiController has no HttpContext.p  pThe WebApiAppication that is instantiated in Global.asax.cs has an HttpContext element Context.  However, unlike MVC 3 and earlier, I cant find a way to access the WebApiApplication from a controller. Earlier generations stored a reference to it in a static Instance variable. MVC 4 removes that.p  pAlso, Im trying to find something that will also work without a ton of extra scaffolding when I call the controller methods from a unit Test. I think I could access it, even in a WebApi Controller, using HttpContext.Current at least it compiles, but I cant mock that for testing. Im talking unit testing here, where you call directly to the Controller methods.  Ive seen some recent tutorials where you unit test with a thin HttpClient, and thus test the whole stack.  That seems more like lowlevel integration testing to me.p  pThis doesnt seem like it should be that difficult, but Ive spent several hours googling it and trying things, and my heads getting bloody from beating it against the wall.p

Negative 450 pI sometimes observed the page shifting when opening a dialog.p  precodelta classmyLink hrefjavascriptvoid0gtclickMeltagt a.myLink.clickfunctione myDialog.dialogopen codepre  pA while back, I found that adding codereturn falsecode in the click callback fixed the behavior.p  pI just learned today that I should use codee.preventDefaultcode instead.p  pSo, I am going back to get rid of all my codereturn falsecodestatements, and I am starting to question whether I needed them in the first place.  Most times, I dont get the same behavior even without the codereturn falsecode.  I dont know if it relates to the browser type or version, the jQuery version, the jQueryUI version, or my JavaScript.p  pI am starting to now believehope it only happens when the target is an anchor link, and what I think is happening is that when the dialog is opened, the default behavior of the link triggers and goes to the top of the page.  Is this correct, or is it causes by something elsep  pThanksp

Negative 450 pOk so I have a fairly simple question which I could not find a concise answer for. I am wondering if i need to worry about calling a codelockcode statement when reading the elapsed property of a codeStopwatchcode while it is still running. p  pAlso is a codeStopwatchcode what I should be using to measure runtimes of a thread. I have read in other similar questions a codeDispatchTimercode could be used.

Some simple code to illustrate what I am talking about.p  precode class foo         private bool isRunning  get set        private Stopwatch sw  get set        public void StartThread                  this.isRunning  true           new Threadnew ThreadStartthis.DoWork.Start           this.sw.Restart                   public void StopThread                  this.isRunning  false           this.sw.Stop              private void DoWork                  whilethis.isRunning                           Do Stuff                         public TimeSpan GetRuntime                  return this.sw.Elapsed              public foo                  isRunning  false           sw  new Stopwatch          codepre  pSay in an application using the above class I were to call codeGetRuntimecode from a different thread before I stop the codeStopwatchcode would I need to add a codelockcode statement to ensure that I get the correct data, and that I wont be blocking the codeStopwatchcode from continuing to run. Or am i correct in thinking that it does not need a codelockcode and will be fine as is.p  pI do understand that you can theoretically run as many reads as you would like, I am just curious seeing as the Elapsed properties backing store is constantly being written to if that changed things or not. I have read a lot of information about thread safety, but I am just looking for a clarification and confirmation I am indeed thinking about this correctly.p

In IE 8 when I try to click and drag the scrollbar, it immediately becomes unclicked just after mousedown, preventing any IE users on 32bit machines from using this scrollbar feature. Everything else about the scrollbar works fine, like clicking the arrows, clicking the space between an arrow and the scrollbar, and using the mousewheel.p  pI have tried removing the codebehavior urlResourcesPIE.htccode rule, but the problem persists.p  pDo divs with overflow auto not workhave bugs in IE 8p  pAlso, this has been tested in 32bit and 64bit versions of FF and Chrome, and everything works fine there, too.p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pI have tested this consistently and I cant seem to figure out whats going on, nor can I see any examples of this ever happening to anyone else online. I tested it with the only rule for codediveventBoxcode being codeoverflow autocode, codeoverflow scrollcode, codeoverflowy autocode, andor codeoverflowy scrollcode and the problem STILL persists. Every time I click the scrollbar in IE 8 no compatibility mode it loses focus.p  pI find it as hard to believe that this is a known bug because of the zero relevant search results as it is to believe that this is something I have messed up, since all it takes is one div with overflowing content producing a scrollbar to cause this glitch.p  pIf I was a rich man, back when Internet Explorer 8 was being developed, I would have gladly paid for everyone from Microsofts Internet Explorer Project Team to take a class on best practices and adhering to standards.p  pstrongUpdate 2strongp  pActually if I doubleclick the scrollbar really fast and hold down the second click, I can actually get a hold of it in IE 8. Of course, this is still no good from an enduser perspective, but perhaps that behavior will help explain the cause.p  pstrongFinal Update Solutionstrongp  pFrom the advice I received from the comments to this post, I decided to remove all script and CSS and start adding things back in, one at a time. The error wasnt in any script, but in CSS. For whatever reason the codebehavior urlResourcesPIE.htccode set on the main site wrapper div Far up the DOM tree from the problem element was apparently causing the problem. I still dont know how, but the solution for me was to simply remove PIE from that element, which in turn broke the other two PIE references, which I was able to fix by setting their position to relative. For now, everything seems to work fine in IE 8, but the moment I experience any other problems as a result of using PIE, I will purge it from my site.p

Thus I am hesitating between using an interface and I am hesitating a hrefhttprpy.sourceforge.netrpy2.html relnofollowrpy2a and a hrefhttpwww.rforge.netRserve relnofollowRservea.p  pWhich one would be more recommendable to begin withp  pWhile reading some bits throughout the internet, I had an impression that Rserve is slightly better off then rpy, since it allows to use a separate server and had a more deep integration with python, but I havent been able to find any more distinctions.p
Negative 450 pI am confused how to take inputs from file. In many of hacking challenge sites input will be in the format p  pno of test casesp  pcase1p  pcase2p  p..so onp  pMy question is what is the best way to read the inputs. Whether i should read all the cases in one loop, store it in an array and then perform operations on the inputs in separate loop OR just use one loop for both to read and perform operations on input. Is there any performance issue between these two methodsp
Negative 450 pI am experimenting with the ability to dynamically invoke procedures or functions that reside in a function table. The specific application is a DLL that exports a pointer to a function table together with information on the number of arguments and types. The host application then has the ability to interrogate the DLL and call the functions. If they were object methods I could use Rtti to invoke them but they are normal procedures and functions. The DLL has to export normal function pointers not objects because the DLL could be written in any language including C, Delphi etc.p  pFor example, I have a record declared and filled out in a DLLp  precodeTAPI  record         add   function var a, b  double  double         mult  function var a, b  double  double end PAPI  TAPI codepre  pI retrieve the pointer to this record, declared asp  precodeapiPtr  PAPI codepre  pAssume I also have access to the names of the procedures, number of arguments and argument types for each entry in the record. p  pAssume I want to call the add function. The function pointer to add will bep  precodeapiPtr.add   I assume this  will give me a pointer to the add function codepre  pI assume there is no other way other than to use some asm to push the necessary arguments on the stack and retrieve the resultp  pFirst question, what is the best calling convention to declare the procedure as, cdecl Seems easiest for assembling the stack before the call.p  pSecond question, are there any examples online that actually do this I came across a hrefhttpwww.swissdelphicenter.chtorryshowcode.phpid1745 relnofollowhttpwww.swissdelphicenter.chtorryshowcode.phpid1745a DynamicDllCall which is close to what I want but I simplified as below, it now returns a pointer EAX to the resultp  precodefunction DynamicDllCallproc  pointer const Parameters array of Pointer pointer var x, n Integer     p Pointer begin n  HighParameters if n gt 1 then begin    x  n    repeat      p  Parameters[x]      asm        PUSH p      end      Decx    until x  1 end asm   CALL proc   MOV p, EAX  lt must be changed to FST result if return value is double end result  p codepre  pendp  pbut I cant get it to work, it returns a value for the first parameters instead of the result. Maybe I have the calling convention wrong or maybe I misunderstand how to retrieve the result in EAX.p  pI call DynamicDllCall as followsp  precodevar proc  pointer     parameters array of Pointer     x, y, z  double     p  pointer begin   x 2.3 y  6.7   SetLengthparameters, 2   parameters[0]  x  parameters[1]  y   proc  apiPtr.add   p  DynamicDllCallproc, Parameters   z  double p codepre  pAny advice gratefully received. I appreciate that some may feel this isnt the way one should go about doing this but I am still curious if it is at least possible.p  pstrongUpdate 1strong I can confirm that the add function is getting the correct values to do the addition.p  pstrongUpdate 2strong If I change the signature of add top  precodeadd   function var a, b, c  double  double codepre  pand I assign the result to c inside add, then I can retrieve the correct answer in the parameters array assuming I add one more element to it, 3 instead of 2. The problem therefore is that I misunderstand how values are returned from functions. Can anyone explain how functions return values and how best to retrieve them p  pstrongUpdate 3strong I have my answer. I should have guessed. Delphi returns different types via different registers. eg integers return via EAX, double on the other hand returns via ST0. To copy ST0 to the result variable I must use FST result rather than MOV p, EAX. I least I now know it is possible in principle to do this. Whether it is a sensible thing to do is another matter I must now think about.p
Negative 450 pI want my iOS app to follow the common pattern of having a main view where signing up or signing in is required to access the app, so if it is the first time the app is run in the device or the user is not logged in, that is the view displayed, and another app view is displayed otherwise.

Negative 450 pI am running some MySQL queries on a pretty large table not on Facebook scale, but around a million rows, and I am finding them very slow. The reason, I suspect, is that I am querying on an codeidcode field, but that codeidcode has not been declared as primary key, and also no index has been declared.p  pI cannot set the codeidcode field to primary key, because it is not unique, although its cardinality is pretty close to 1. Under these circumstances, if I do a codealter tablecode to add an index on the codeidcode field, is it supposed to boost up the query speed, given that it is not a primary keyp  pAnd supposing it does, how long will it take for the index to develop fully so that the queries start executing quickly I mean, the moment the prompt appears after executing the codealter tablecode, or is it that even though the prompt appears the index building will go on internally for quite some time I am asking before doing it because I am not sure whether declaring index on nonunique field corrupts the db or notp

Negative 450 pMy question goes a little bit deeper than written in the headline. Let me explain the situation.

I can iterate over each kind individually. So far, so fine.p  pBut now my use case is the following Based on some criteria, I get either a containerOne or a containerTwo object. I need to iterate over the edges. But because the types are different, I cannot emeasilyem do so without code duplication.p  pSo my idea is the following I want to have an iterator with the following properties   Regarding its traversal behavior, it behaves either like a codestdvectorltedgeOnegtconstiteratorcode or a codestdvectorltedgeTwogtconstiteratorcode, depending on how it was initialized.   Instead of returning a codeconst edgeOne ampcode or codeconst edgeTwo ampcode, codeoperatorcode should return a codestdpairltint,intgtcode, i.e., apply a conversion.p  pI found the a hrefhttpwww.boost.orgdoclibs1540libsiteratordocindex.html relnofollowBoost.Iterator Librarya, in particularp  ul liiteratorfacade, which helps to build a standardconforming iterator andli litransformiterator, which could be used to transform codeedgeOnecode and codeedgeTwocode to codestdpairltint,intgtcode, but I am not completely sure how the complete solution should look like. If I build nearly the entire iterator myself, is there any benefit to use transformiterator, or will it just make the solution more heavyweightli ul  pI guess the iterator only needs to store the following datap  ul liA flag bool would be sufficient for the moment, but probably an enum value is easier to extend if necessary indicating whether the value type is edgeOne or edgeTwo.li liA codeunioncode with entries for both iterator types where only the one that matches the flag will ever be accessed.li ul  pAnything else can be computed onthefly.p  pI wonder if there is an existing solution for this polymorphic behavior, i.e. an iterator implementation combining two or more underlying iterator implementation with the same value type. If such a thing exists, I could use it to just combine two codetransformiteratorcodes.p  pDispatching i.e., deciding whether a containerOne or a containerTwo object needs to be accessed could easily be done by a freestanding function ...p  pAny thoughts or suggestions regarding this issuep

Negative 450 pI am writing a script that automates the completion a web form in my Rails app using the form entries given on the client side. However, this site uses Javascript, and so Mechanize is out of the question.p  pHowever, everything Ive read about Mechanizes alternatives  Watir Webdriver, Selenium, Capybara Webkit  all focus seemingly exclusively on testing. However, my Rails web app would take in form entries from users, and then enter them using one of these tools into another website.

Negative 450 pWhen creating a hyperlink in powerpoint or word 2010 to take the user to our website, the link changes from what I put in powerpoint to include a target tag after the domain name followed by the remainder of the link. This then for some reason forces the user to log in again before accessing the website a secured site even if they are already logged in. However, if the link I provided is pasted in the browser as I thought powerpoint would basically do, everything works as intended and the user is brought to the desired location within our site if logged in.p  pI ended up getting it to work via a method with vba, but I was wondering if anyone could explain why this might be happening. Im not entirely sure if this is something on our end or something to do with powerpoint or maybe both. Thanks.p

Negative 450 pI recently tried implementing radix sort for a vector of pair of integers where the second element is considered only when the first elements are equal. I did so by applying counting sort twice  first to the second element of the pair, and then to the first element. Here is how I implemented the counting sort at firstp  precodevector to be sorted of size n. vectorltintgt arr  arr gets filled here   N1 is the maximum number which can occur in the array. N was equal to n in my case vectorltvectorltintgt gt matN  for int i0iltni      mat[arr[i]].pushbacki   array in which the sorted array will be stored vectorltintgt arr2  for int i0iltNi      forint j0jltszmat[i]j arr2.pushbackarr1[mat[i][j]]  codepre  pThe first for loop obviously runs in On. Since the mat array has exactly n entries, it will be accessed at most 2n times in the second nested loop. This implies that the above code has a time complexity of On, as it should have.p  pI then compared the running time of this code with the STL sort which has a time complexity of  Onlogn by running both of them on an array of 106 elements. To my great surprise, the STL sort ended up performing slightly better than my implementation of radix sort.p  pI then changed my counting sort implementation to the followingp  precodevector to be sorted of size n. vectorltintgt arr  arr gets filled here  N1 is the maximum number which can occur in the array. N was equal to n in my case vectorltintgt tempN,0  forint i0iltni temp[arr[i]]  forint i1iltNi temp[i]temp[i1]  array in which the sorted array will be stored vectorltintgt arr2n  forint in1igt0i arr2[temp[arr[i]]]arr[i] codepre  pThis time, the radix sort did run about 56 times faster than the STL sort. This observation has left me wondering why is it that the my first radix sort implementation runs so much slower than the second one, when both of them are Onp

Negative 450 pI am working on an application that will provide audio input to some device. The device expects the audio input to be provided in the form of raw audio data stream 16 bit, 48kHz. So, irrespective of the format of audio data in the wave file 8bit, 16bit, 24bit, 32bit etc., I want to extract raw audio data from the WAV file. I planned to use stronglibsndFilestrong library for this purpose. I modified the C sample code of libsndfile as shown belowp  precodeinclude stdafx.h include ltsndfile.hhgt  static void createfile const char  fname, int format, const short buffer,const   unsigned intamp len          file      int channels  1   A Mono wave file.     int srate  48000       printf Creating file named sn, fname       SndfileHandle file  SndfileHandle fname, SFMWRITE, format, channels, srate       int x  file.write buffer, len    static void readfile const char  fname         SndfileHandle       file       file  SndfileHandle fname        const unsigned int uiBuffLen  file.channels  file.frames     short data  new short [uiBuffLen]      memsetdata,0x00,uiBuffLen      int x  file.commandSFCSETSCALEFLOATINTREAD, voiddata, uiBuffLen     file.read data, uiBuffLen    Read the audio data in the form of 16 bit short integer      Now create a new wave file with audio data in the form of 16 bit short integers     createfile ConvertedFile.wav, SFFORMATWAV  SFFORMATPCM16,data, const unsigned intampuiBuffLen       Now fill a buffer containing audio data and dump it into a file so that the same can be fed to a device expecting the raw audio data      unsigned char bytBuffer  new unsigned char[uiBuffLen2]     memsetbytBuffer, 0x00, uiBuffLen2     file.readRawbytBuffer, uiBuffLen2      FILE  pFile     pFile  fopen RawAudio.dat,w     if pFileNULL              fwritebytBuffer, 1, uiBuffLen2, pFile         fclose pFile                  delete [] data     delete [] bytBuffer       int tmainint argc, TCHAR argv[]      The sample file is a Mono file containing audio data in float format.     const char  fname  MonoWavFile.wav       readfile fname       return 0  codepre  pWell, the above code might look horrible, but I am just looking for the idea at the moment. I use a file MonoWaveFile.wav which is a mono wave file and has audio data in the form of 32 bit float values.  I create a new file ConvertedFile.wav using the libsndfile library. This file has audio data in 16bit PCM format. I play this file in a media player and I see that the conversion has been done properly.p  pThen I create another file RawAudio.dat to save only the audio data, which I can use to feed the audio input to the device. The file is created and when I send it to the device, the audio is not proper at all. This indicates that I am doing somthing horribly wrong. Can any one let me know what wrong I am doing I have never worked on anything like this before, so I will appreciate if I get any sort of help.p

This works fine.       printAlldb, 1 THIS would work.

I have looked through the ListViewItem and ListView styles in the generic.xaml file and edited them in my App.xaml file... but I havent been able to find any settings that made the correct change.p  pIn the ListViewItem style with the key ListViewItemExpanded, I tried changing the ToHorizontalOffset propertiesp  precodeltVisualState xNameHorizontalSelectionHintgt     ltStoryboardgt         ltSwipeHintThemeAnimation TargetNameSelectionBackground ToHorizontalOffset23 ToVerticalOffset0 gt         ltSwipeHintThemeAnimation TargetNameContentBorder ToHorizontalOffset23 ToVerticalOffset0 gta         ltSwipeHintThemeAnimation TargetNameSelectedBorder ToHorizontalOffset23 ToVerticalOffset0 gt         ltSwipeHintThemeAnimation TargetNameSelectedCheckMark ToHorizontalOffset23 ToVerticalOffset0 gt         ltDoubleAnimationUsingKeyFrames Storyboard.TargetNameHintGlyph                                 Storyboard.TargetPropertyOpacity                                 Duration000.500gt             ltDiscreteDoubleKeyFrame Value0.5 KeyTime000 gt             ltDiscreteDoubleKeyFrame Value0 KeyTime000.500 gt         ltDoubleAnimationUsingKeyFramesgt     ltStoryboardgt ltVisualStategt codepre  pI also tried changing the ListViewItemReorderHintThemeOffsetp  precodeltxDouble xKeyListViewItemReorderHintThemeOffsetgt40.0ltxDoublegt codepre  pwhich is used in the RightReorderHint and LeftReorderHintp  precodeltVisualState xNameRightReorderHintgt     ltStoryboardgt         ltDragOverThemeAnimation TargetNameReorderHintContent ToOffsetThemeResource ListViewItemReorderHintThemeOffset DirectionRight gt     ltStoryboardgt ltVisualStategt ltVisualState xNameLeftReorderHintgt     ltStoryboardgt         ltDragOverThemeAnimation TargetNameReorderHintContent ToOffsetThemeResource ListViewItemReorderHintThemeOffset DirectionLeft gt     ltStoryboardgt ltVisualStategt codepre  pNone of these even made any visible difference and Im not sure what to try next.

Negative 450 pI do a WCF client call over a secured connection HTTPS. This call takes very much time about 30 to 40 seconds. Then I get a chain trust exception.p  pSo i added the following code to ignore this errorp  precodeSystem.Net.ServicePointManager.ServerCertificateValidationCallback       a, b, c, d gt true codepre  pThe call works now without an exception  but its still very slow. During investigation using Fiddler I recognized that there where four additional HTTP requests which all times out. The last call is the call from my request which works.p  pSo I know the reason for the delay.p  pFiddler shows CryptoAPI as the user agent for the additional calls. I know that CryptoAPI tries to resolve the certificate chain by downloading the missing certificates  but the host isnt available.p  pI know, I can manually install all needed certificates to the certificate store. Then it works and the additional requests are gone.p  pBut I wonder if is it also possible to disable the certificate chain check via CryptoAPI Its an intranet service and therefore the check isnt really important.p

Naturally, I display instances of a persons codeSetltCommunicationgtcode in a datatable.

This is not sufficient here since I can only add one transient element with a codenullcode PK.p  pThe only option offered by the a hrefhttpdocs.jboss.orghibernateorm4.3manualenUShtmlsinglepersistentclassesequalshashcode relnofollowhibernate manuala is to implement equals and hashCode in terms of business equivalence. Since the Communication object is basically a glorified codeStringcode, this is not possible. A user needs to edit every aspect of the object.p  pIve thought about creating a sequence service that reserves a id for the transient entity and assigns it to the object on creation. But I fear this interferes with Hibernates ability to determine if the entity is transient or not.p  pSo the question is are there better options to edit, add and delete transient objects when I cant provide business keyp

Negative 450 pI am in the process of planning out a rock paper scissors game using swing that will follow the MVC design. The purpose of this is to learn more about how MVC works, and not to be usefulfunctional. The design I have right now has a form that allows the user to create new games, and then the games appear in a JTabbedPane so that the user can have multiple games running at a time. I have 2 questions about this systemp  pShould the rock paper scissors logic be handled in the model, or should the logic be handled in the controller I have an enum that represents the different choices and an algorithm to find out who won, but I am a little confused as to where that should actually be handled.p  pMy second question might be a little confusing. The way I have it planned out right now is I have a JPanel called GamePanel and each game has one of these as a tab in the TabbedPane. What is the proper way to link my GamePanel with my Game data that comes from the model In the simplest case, each game has a GamePanel and a Game object for storing the data. What is the correct way to link these together in the controller so that through an event system I can easily take user input and modify the correct game based on it The first thing that comes to mind would be a HashMapGamePanel, Game but that doesnt seem to be very elegant.p

I think it works in the codestdarraycode example, though, because the values given are compiletime constants known to be within the domain of codefloatcode. Here, on the other hand, the variadic template uses codeintcode for the parameter types and the conversion happens within the constructors initializer list where the values arent known at compiletime.p  pI dont want to do an explicit cast in the constructor since that would then allow for all numeric values even if they cant be represented by codefloatcode.p  pThe only way I can think of to get what I want is to somehow have a variable number of parameters, but of a specific type in this case, Id want codefloatcode. Im aware of codestdinitializerlistcode, but Id like to be able to enforce the number of parameters at compile time as well.p  pAny ideas Is what I want even possible with C11 Anything new proposed for C14 that will solve thisp

Negative 450 pIm working on a custom version of Android on a device with a closed source camera HAL, so Ive had to add a camera wrapper, which is a lib that Android loads instead of the vendor camera, so that bugs and peculiarities with the vendor implementation can be worked around. Ive found that I need to vary the behavior between apps, so that while in Snapchat I dont want to implement a certain parameter, for example, Hangouts crashes if I dont set it. The problem is Android doesnt tell the camera which app is using it. I tried the following code to see what my pid was but the result was systembinmediaserver not exactly what I had in mind. Asking for parent id was even worse, it just returned 1. What I seek is trivial in Android java, but Im constrained to C and whatever includes I can find in Bionic here.

Negative 450 pIm designing a new software solution that includes a .NET web app hosted in IIS, from which users can trigger various pieces of functionality again, has to be .NET code to execute asynchronously in the background. Im looking for appropriate technologies and architecture to use to accomplish this. Some important features that need to be supported arep  ol lipWhen the background functionality completes, the web application needs to be informed so that it can then inform the users on the browsers via websockets.pli lipIf the process executing the functionality crashes, on restart of that process it must be able to detect that the code did not complete and restart execution of that codepli lipIt must be possible to schedule the background functionality to start at some point in the future. Again, if the hosting process crashes, on restart it must become reaware of the scheduled task so that it still successfully starts executing the functionality at the appropriate time.pli ol  pIf the background functionality is implemented by launching a new thread within the IIS instance, this makes 1 easy to implement. However, special code would have to be written to support 2 and 3 and it seems that many believe that hosting background functionality that needs to be able to recover from a crash or be scheduled in the future, inside the Web App, is bad practice.p  pAnother option is to host the background process in a windows service. If so, what is the best way to solve 1, 2 and 3 This would all still require custom code  so is there software available that handles these requirements alreadyp

The main reasons coming to mind are that we can track how much every customer spends in terms of billing, and speed up the database since Cloud SQL is just a MySQL instance.p  pSteps for the creation would require editing a properties file in the packaged .war file, adding the certificate used to log in as a service account, and  probably something that I am missing at this moment Pp  pThis question is somehow related a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions17716697createanappengineprojectidcommandlinerq1Create an App Engine Project ID command lineap

By thinking of it, someone can call my restful method to generate any form token he wants using session id he found by brute forcing or whatever, and then call any other restful method to change anything for that user.. also, my server should be limited to be accessed only from the application... cant restrict origin because the IP changes from phone to phone... what are the restriction my server should havep  pI am a starter at security for web apps and any advice, explaining and help would really help is my application secure enoughp

Negative 450 pCurrently I am working on a very simple java ball program. The program consists of a ball that falls from the top of the screen and bounces on the floor before coming to a rest. The program uses a method that is called 50 times a second the rate at which the gametimer ticks and in which refreshes the screen and places the ball at its current x and y positions which are affected by gravity and the s key. When the s key is pressed the balls height is increased. However, in the current version of my program the ball just jumps 50 pixels when the s key is pressed. How would I make it so there is a smooth transition when the s key is pressed The high refresh rate is kind of confusing me. Here is my current code not including the method the refreshes and the method that draws the ballp  precodepublic void keyPressedkeyEvent event      if event.KeyCode  KeyEvent.VKS          firstball.BallLocation        public void BallLocation      currentPositionY  currentPositionY  50  currentGravity  codepre  pThanks for your helpp

Negative 450 pI am trying to implement kmeans algorithm for a certain Music Recommendation System in Java.br I have generated 2 arrays,codeplaysFinal[]codethe total playcount of an artist by all users in the dataset and codeartFinal[]code the unique artists in the entire dataset .

Negative 450 pI have an app I want to publish in both Korean and English. However, after researching the localization methods for Android, it seems that theres a lot disadvantages to the translation method where you dump different string xml files into the res folder, like you wont be able to finecode any particular function for one language and not the other for example, in my applications clock that lives within the app, the English version will display 750AM is the current time while I want the Korean version to display it is 7O Clock and 50 minutes in Korean. And theres extra strings in the English version thats not in the Korean version ... so its kind of a mess. p  pAre there any disadvantages or conventional wisdom against making two separate apps except for the fact that any future updates you make, you will have to do it into two different projectsp

Negative 450 pI created a user control that functions as a keyboard.  I arranged the buttons in the control in the exact same manner as a keyboard, and set codeControlStyles.Selectable, falsecode.  This allows the focus to stay in a textbox that the user selected on the parent form.  I also set the style of the user control to not be selectable.

Negative 450 pIm currently in the process of making a pretty large Akka based Java application and Im running into a couple issues that bug me to no end.p  pMy current package layout looks kinda like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comi6zYG.png altProject Structurep  pMy codeMobilecode class serving as the supervisor of the actors inside the codeactorscode package.p  pSince I dont want to create a new set of Actors for every codeHttpClientcode and codeAccountcode, I pass those around in message objects, which are stored in the messages package, together with the endpoint codeActorRefcode that receives the final result. This does however create a very cluttered codemessagescode package with a different message for each actor. Eg. codeMobileForActor1code, codeActor1ForMobilecode, codeMobileForActor2code etc. Now my question is, is there a Convention to use for this sort of stuff that deals with this problem and is my structure codeMobilecodecodeActor1codecodeMobilecodecodeActor2codeetc. the way Akka wants it to be or do I have to just sort of waterfall the messages codeMobilecodecodeActor1codecodeActor2codeetc.p  pRight now Im sending a codeConnectMessagecode to my codeMobilecode actor which then sends it to codeActor1code, codeActor1code processes it and sends a new message back to codeMobilecode, codeMobilecode sends that response then to codeActor2code and the cycle continues with a new message being created based on the old message. Eg. codenew Message2message1.foo, message1.bar, message1.baz, newComputatedResult, newComputatedResult2, etccodep  pIs this good practice or should I include the old instance which may contain info that isnt useful anymore and include the new stuff Eg. codenew Message2message1, newComputatedResult, newComputatedResult2, etccodep  pOr should I do something completely differentp  pI thought about using TypedActors but those require the use of a waterfall pattern and I dont know how I would pass on the ActorRef of the listener that wants to receive the final result.p  pI hope I made myself understandable enough because English is not my maiden languages and that the question is clear to everyone.p  pIm a beginning Akka developer and love the idea but since the documentation doesnt cover this very well, I figured this would be the best place to ask.

Negative 450 pI am newbie in Wordpress development. One of my client is asking to create a new project. My Clients needs are   p  pBasically he wants to add contests for city wise. On the website entering page, a user sign up form would be there. If a user enters a zip code then according to zip code hisher city will be traced and this entry would be filled under this city. After signing up heshe could upload their videos on the server. There will be an another option to record audiovideo online on the website. To record video on live contestant needs to pay little amount. Admin can create couple of logins for the CMS. These users can login and only see contestants videos not their private information. These users can send video download link to anyone as they want. Admin also wants to run sweepstakes for cities.   p  pCan I create this whole project in Wordpress  If I could, then which plugins do I need to research more  Thanks in advance.p

My query is how to use these parse objects in my mail so that content of mail changes dynamicallyI have few table entries in mail which should change according to data entered by user If possible could you provide me with sample JS code. I have Googled about this but couldnt find much documentation related to this topic. Or should i use some Mandrill API in some other languages such as Python Thanks in advance.p

Negative 450 pMy question is more related to how WebSockets on the client workbehave with threads in .Net and what I am looking for as an answer would be more of a low level explanation on how the OS interacts with the .Net thread when it receives data from the server on its socket. p  pSuppose I have a client that opens 1000 sockets to a server asynchronously. It then sits there waiting for updatesevents to come through. These events can arrive at different times and frequencies. p  pAssuming that every time data comes in via a socket, a thread needs to pick it up and do some work on it, am I correct to assume that bIFb all the 1000 sockets receive data at the same time I will then have 1000 threads 1 thread per socket coming from the Thread Pool to pickup the data from the socket What if I wanted to have 3000 sockets open p  pAny clarification on this is very much appreciated.p
Negative 450 pIm trying to implement a threeway diffmerge algorithm in python between, say, the base version X and two different derivative versions A and B, and Im having trouble figuring out how to handle some changes.p  pI have a linebyline diff from X to A, and from X to B. These diffs give, for each line, an opcode which is either codecode, if the line didnt change, codecode if a line was added, codecode if the line was removed, and codeccode if the line was changed which is simply a codecode immediately followed by a codecode, indicating a line was removed and then replaced, effectively modified.p  pNow Im comparing corresponding opcodes from the Adiff and the Bdiff, to try to decide how to merge them. Some of these opcode combos are easy codecode and codecode means neither version changed the line, so we keep the original. codecode and codecode means that a line was added on one side and no change was made on the other, so accept the addition and advance to the next line only on the side that added the line. And codecode and codeccode is a conflict that the user must resolve, because one one side a line was changed, on the other side the same line was removed.p  pHowever, Im struggling with what to do with a codecode and a codecode, or a codecode and a codeccode. In the first case for instance, I added a new line on one side, and deleted a subsequent line on the other side. Strictly, I dont think this is a conflict, but what if the addition was relying on that line being there I guess that applies to the entire thing something added in one place may rely on something somewhere else to make sense. The second case is similar, I added a line on one side, and on the other side I changed a subsequent line, but the addition may be relying on the original version of the line.p  pWhat is the normal approach to handling thisp

Negative 450 pI am currently writing a JSON parser using Java but Im having trouble deciding which tactic I should use for this task. Note that answers on this are going to influence future tactics for me, so please try to keep your approach as generic as possible this is just an example.p  pFirst of all we need the parser, but then I thought of the following why not create an codeenumcode for the JSON codearraycode and JSON  codeobjectscode Eventually the code will be much more object oriented and if a new type in JSON comes out which is never going to happen probably you have to write less code. So my codeenumcode would look like thisp  precodepublic enum Brackets    Object , , JSONObject.class,   Array [, ], JSONArray.class    public final char startChar   public final char endChar   public final Classltgt correspondingClass   private Bracketschar start, char end, Classltgt corresponding      startChar  start     endChar  end     correspondingClass  corresponding     codepre  pThrough the standard enum methods one could basically iterate over the actual enumerations and take proper actions on proper situations.p  pTo come back on the new JSON types, it is imaginary. Lets say person X says, lets add ,  objects which stands for Y. I want something where you can add something very easy without a hassle, with this enum I only have to add a new enumerationp  precodeY , , JSONY.class codepre  pTo me it really looks hardcoded if you just use those two objects  so it would look likep  precodepublic class Parser       ......    public Object getJSONString t        if ....            return new JSONObjectt        else f   ....              return new JSONArrayt              return null         ......  codepre  pOf course the constructors would be different and stuff, but that is not the pont, and if you do it through reflection it is only based on the enumeration and the algorithm should do the rest for you  So this will look likep  precodepublic class Parser    ....   public Object getJSONString t       forBrackets b  Brackets.values          if  ....               return b.correspondingClass.getConstructorString.class.newInstancet                     return null     codepre  p.p  pSo what is a better practise, to hardcode if you know that only those two objects will be available or do it through reflection and make your life easier if a new socalled JSON type comes outp  pI want to emphasize that this is not about the algorithm on how to parse it properly, but more about what is better to do.p

Unfortunately, the documentation is a bit ambiguous so that I was not able to figure out how to implement my jacobian function.p  pIn order to verify how emodeintem has to be called, Ive been using the following somewhat silly codep  precodefrom scipy.integrate import odeint lmax  5  def f1y, t     ydot  np.zeroslmax     for i in rangelmax         ydot[i]  y[i]2y[i]3     return ydot  def fulljacy, t,     J  np.zeroslmax, lmax     J[0,0]3y[0]2  2y[0]     J[1,1]3y[1]2  2y[1]     J[2,2]3y[2]2  2y[2]     J[3,3]3y[3]2  2y[3]     J[4,4]3y[4]2  2y[4]     return J   initial conditions and output times delta  0.0001 yini   np.array[delta]lmax times  np.linspace0, 2delta, 100  y, infodict  odeintf1, yini, times, Dfunfulljac, fulloutput1 printf1 nst 0, nfe 1, nje 2.formatinfodict[nst][1],                                                 infodict[nfe][1],                                                 infodict[nje][1] codepre  pUsing the full NxN jacobian matrix the integration is successfull. Using only the diagonal and emmu0em and emml0em the integration succeeds as well. p  pTo test the banded matrix use case Im creating an artificial 3xN banded jacobian using emmu1em and emml1em, where all the derivatives off the diagonal are zero. This causes a weird behavior of the solver similar to what I see in my original problem where the offdiagonals are non zero.p  precodedef bandjacy, t     J  np.zeroslmax, 3     J[0,1]3y[0]2  2y[0]     J[1,1]3y[1]2  2y[1]     J[2,1]3y[2]2  2y[2]     J[3,1]3y[3]2  2y[3]     J[4,1]3y[4]2  2y[4]     return J  y, infodict  odeintf1, yini, times, Dfunbandjac, fulloutput1, mu1, ml1 printf1 nst 0, nfe 1, nje 2.formatinfodict[nst][1],                                                 infodict[nfe][1],                                                 infodict[nje][1] codepre  pWhat is the proper way to use the banded jacobian option with SciPys integrate.odeintp

Negative 450 pIm working to learn some good frameworks o set of frameworkslanguages for to build some RIA java based, not exclusively businessoriented ones.

But whats means reinforcing what can be the good partner serverside for GWTp  pIve gived a look at Vaadin, but i dont like so much that philosophy the Gwt idea to spare the elaboration load from server and client is winning, in my opinion, while in Vaadin, if i dont understand wrong, the elaboration is almost only serverside.p  pNow the question is what is the best 2014 practice road  Only GWT  GWT  server side add ons and what addons  Vaadin Or something differentp

Negative 450 pThis question is very abstract in the sense that it comes from me, as a designer, with very limited knowledge about web and front end development constraints, so please be gentle. p  pIve been assigned with the task of designing a proposal for a digital signature service. The service is a web view, and the target is exclusively touch based devices. The service will feature a hand signature field, where the user will input their actual signature using a finger gesture. Now, I would prefer this step to provide the user with the entire screen real estate that is, signing in fullscreen landscape, but I dont know if its technically feasible. Basically, the user will type in general info probably in portrait in standard text input fields using her onscreen keyboard, and then finally for the signature tap an element which preferably will launch a emlandscape viewem for the user to enter a signature. Can someone tech savvy with good knowledge of web development for mobile please shed some light on whether implementing such a behavior in a web view, which should force the UI to go landscape, is possiblep  pProducing a view similar to thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comNtRLN.png altenter image description herep  pstrongDisclaimerstrong Im not doing any development myself, this is simply for me trying to avoid delivering a design proposal which isnt technically possible.p

Negative 450 pI have this homework to do and too much time on my hands, so I want the answer to be perfect instead of just correct. It is all theoretical with no real database behind it. I wondered, whether it would make a performance difference to switch position of WHERE statements as followsp  pOrder is a table of orders with an order number as primary key. Customer is a table of customers with customer number Cno as primary key. Cno is foreign key in table Order. My task is to formulate a select statement that gives me all the orders for customers named Meier, Name is a data column of the customer table.p  pMy first idea is to connect the tables with the foreign key and filter with the namep  precodeSELECT O. FROM Order O, Customer C WHERE O.Cno  C.Cno AND C.Name  Meier codepre  pI visualize this statement to make a LARGE table with all customer and order data and then to filter with the name.p  pThen I had the idea I might make the intermediate table smaller to win some performance, so I thought I might reduce the amount of customers to fetch orders for first. I thought of thisp  precodeSELECT O. FROM Customer C, Order O WHERE C.Name  Meier AND O.Cno  C.Cno codepre  pNow I see that imaginary intermediate table to only include orders for customer Meier and to not to be so large any more.p  pThen again, I thought Oracle probably optimizes all of this away on its own, so I dont need to worry about it.p  pWould there be a difference in the performance of these queries, just because the sequence of two whereclause statements is reversedp

Negative 450 pAs an exercise, Ive been working on replicating a hrefhttpenigmadevice.com relnofollowthis gamea. In case it becomes inaccessible, the premise of the game is to take a quote thats been scrambled by swapping pairs of letters eg replace A with M and vice versa, and unscramble it to its original arrangement.p  pAs Im studying this game, I realize its almost trivial to extract the solution from the source  there are any number of breakpoints you can place to access it. Ive been trying to come up with a way to obscure the string in a way that it isnt immediately accessible, and the only thing I can think of is some kind of native obscuring function before the quote even has a chance to land in a variable.

Since I have a dependency B in A, I mock it with Mockito. For both tests, I was told that I should assume that the dependency b is fully tested and properly working since we want to test the business logic in A.p  pAt first it looks like that I dont have to test anything for codereportSomethingcode since it only involves calls to codebcode and they are all working The only thing I can think of to test is whether they are actually called and the order of the calls, correct So should I just call a.reportSomething and then do the verification One thing that bugs me is that whether I should stub the b.process1 and b.process2 to return anything. I tried without stubbing anything and it worked, but whyp  pFor testDoSomething, I think what Im really testing is the calculateFinal method. But since it uses the data from the Request object, I need to set that data in Request codercode first. Since codercode directly comes from codeb.process2code, I should stub the method call to return a Request object with that data. But I could skip the stubbing of codeb.process1code, right p  pIs this a right thinking process Did I miss something or misunderstand something If its right, is there a better and cleaner way to write it Thank youp  precodepublic class ATest     private static final int SCORE  100      Mock     private B mockB      InjectMocks     private A aClient      Before     public void setUpTest         MockitoAnnotations.initMocksthis           Test     public void testReportSomething          what should I test here          Request r  new Request           is it necessary to include the following two lines         whenmockB.process1anyRequest.class.returnr         whenmockB.process2anyRequest.class.returnr           aClient.reportSomethingr         InOrder inOrder  inOrdermockProcesser         inOrder.verifymockProcesser.process1anyRequest.class         inOrder.verifymockProcesser.process2anyRequest.class         inOrder.verifymockProcesser.reportanyRequest.class           Test     public void testDoSomething          Is this correct         Request r  new Request         r.setFinalSCORE           I skipped this line and it still works         whenmockB.process1anyRequest.class.returnr          whenmockB.process2anyRequest.class.returnr         assertSCORE  2, aClient.doSomethingr          is it still necessary to verify the call to mockB       codepre

Negative 450 pI am currently trying to port our existing app to Swift. I used a lot of 3rd party libraries in the old app, but I want to avoid that in the new implementation, because it gave me some heavy compatibility issues with newer iOS versions.p  pSo here is my situation I previously used a MMDrawerController a hrefhttpsgithub.commutualmobileMMDrawerController relnofollowhttpsgithub.commutualmobileMMDrawerControllera to create a main menu, that can be swiped in from the left at any time regardless which ViewController is shown in center as main view. Now I am trying to achieve the same functionality with UISplitViewController in my Swift app.p  pEverything works fine on the iPad.   Landscape MasterViewController main menu is visible all the time. Thats ok because we have enough space  Portrait MasterViewController can be swiped in from the left or can be toggled via displayModeItemp  pBut I am facing issues on iPhone and I am not sure if I could solve them anyhow. Is there a way to show the MasterViewController via UIBarButtonItem from ANY ViewController that is in the detail navigation stack I know its impossible to show it as an overlay like on iPad, but I need a functionality to toggle the current DetailViewController with the MasterViewController and vice versa.p  pAny ideas are appreciated...p  pThanksp

That means it does not move from its address space as that would take time. p  p2  The buffer is the data structure used in the interop.

Negative 450 pI have a SignalR solution that is deployed to an Azure Web Role cloud service, not Azure Web Site and in order to ensure we can maximise the number of connections to each instance I need to make some changes various ASP.NET settings as detailed in this article a hrefhttpwww.asp.netsignalroverviewperformancesignalrperformancetuning relnofollowhttpwww.asp.netsignalroverviewperformancesignalrperformancetuningap  pThe appConcurrentRequestLimit and requestQueueLimit settings were easily changed with a startup task that uses APPCMD to make the relevant changes.  However, the maxConcurrentRequestsPerCPU setting resides in the aspnet.config file which cannot be changed via the same mechanism.p  pI have tried updating that file directly with a startup task just a basic file replacement for now, however it seems to get replaced by the Azure runtime after the startup tasks have completed and so the change is lost.  I can RDP into the machine and make the change manually so I have seen that it works however that is not sustainable for a service that we expect to scale up and down on demand.p  pAny ideas on how to change this setting in an Azure environment would be appreciatedp

Negative 450 pLets say I create a rotating file logger with python using RotatingFileHandler. I set number of files to 10, and each file size to 1 MB. My question is related to how the rotation happens. Is it that the rotation happens by keeping all the 10 files open and ensuring the contents of each file is modified as and when a line gets added to the latest file If that is so, then there should be at least 10 file descriptors that are always open.p  pSay each file has 100 KB chunk rows, so each has just 10 rows. So when another row of 100 KB is inserted through this rotating log handler, wouldnt the last row of each file be put at the top of the next file from newer to older So it makes sense to keep all the file descriptors open all the time, doesnt itp

Negative 450 pAccording to a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comgoogleappscalendarv3referenceeventsmethods relnofollowhttpsdevelopers.google.comgoogleappscalendarv3referenceeventsmethodsa, there is a delete method. Instead, I only find a remove method. I understand the difference is that remove only takes the event off that specific calendar, whereas delete takes it off any calendar it was on. So what happened to delete Is the documentation wrong and the remove method is the replacement with option arguments to handle various casesp
Negative 450 pThere are plenty of examples of CSS equal height columns, Holy Grail layouts, clever implementations of codedisplay tablecellcode and of course some delicious codedisplay flexcode ideas out there, not least here on SO.p  pBut Im trying to achieve something that I havent been able to find anywhere else, and I havent been able to achieve without resorting to JS, which I would rather avoid.p  pIm trying to create a set of equalheight parent containers, each of which have a set of child elements which share height between cards. Each card is separated from other the adjacent cards by a gutter. Apparently I cant post images because Im new, but its much easier to explain visually. So heres a link to a free image hosting site a hrefhttppostimg.orgimageltcd8ns1l relnofollowhttppostimg.orgimageltcd8ns1lap  pIn the image, youll see three cards 1, 2, 3, each of which has three sections 1a, 1b, 1c, 2a, 2b, 2c, 3a, 3b, 3c. Each section within a card is the same height as the equivalent section in the other cards ie. 1b  2b  3b, 1c  2c  3c, etc. The height of each equivalent section eg. 1b, 2b amp 3b is determined by the height of the tallest of those sections ie. the tallest b. The height of the tallest section is determined by the amount of content inside this section. p  pI have been able to achieve this visually using a codedisplay tablecode method, including separate tablecell elements for gutters between cards, but unfortunately the markup is disordered and unsemantic, something like thisp  pdiv classsnippet datalangjs datahidefalse div classsnippetcode pre classsnippetcodehtml langhtml prettyprintoverridecodeltdiv classtablerowgt ltdiv classheadinggtheadingltdivgt ltdiv classguttergtltdivgt ltdiv classheadinggtheadingltdivgt ltdiv classguttergtltdivgt ltdiv classheadinggtheadingltdivgt ltdiv classguttergtltdivgt ltdivgt ltdiv classtablerowgt ltdiv classbodygtbody text hereltdivgt ltdiv classguttergtltdivgt ltdiv classbodygtbody text hereltdivgt ltdiv classguttergtltdivgt ltdiv classbodygtbody text hereltdivgt ltdiv classguttergtltdivgt ltdivgt ltdiv classtablerowgt ltdiv classfootgtfooterltdivgt ltdiv classguttergtltdivgt ltdiv classfootgtfooterltdivgt ltdiv classguttergtltdivgt ltdiv classfootgtfooterltdivgt ltdiv classguttergtltdivgt ltdivgtcodepre div div p  p...Horrible.p  pSo I was also been able to get something working with codedisplay flexcode.

Negative 450 pPretty much just the question. I have a client that is requesting a negative design with nearly white text all over the webpage, but testers are saying that its annoying to copy and paste from the website as everything shows up as white text when copying into Word or the like.p  pIs there a way to either preemptively remove formatting when a user tries to copy text from the website Or is there a way to hijack what actually gets put on the clipboardp

Negative 450 pI have two views in this scenario, tableviewA and tableViewB. When I click on a table row cell in ViewA, I want to start the spinning indicator.p  pas of now when I hit the cell, it performs a segue into ViewB. Then in ViewDidLoad in ViewB, it downloads long running operation, then loads new tableview cells. After the tableviewB loads I want to turn off the spinning indicator in ViewA.p  pSo far I put the indicator in viewA like sop  pViewAp  precode voidviewDidLoad  [super viewDidLoad]   self.activityView  [[UIActivityIndicatorView alloc] initWithActivityIndicatorStyleUIActivityIndicatorViewStyleGray] self.activityView.frame  CGRectMake0.0, 0.0, 35.0, 35.0 self.activityView.center  self.view.center [self.view addSubviewself.activityView]   voidtableViewUITableView tableView didSelectRowAtIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath  [self.activityView startAnimating] codepre  pViewBp  precode voidviewDidLoad  [super viewDidLoad]  LONG RUNNING OPERATION HERE codepre  pso obviously Im doing something wrong.  What happens now, is I only see the indicator turn on in ViewA after the long running operation in viewB finishes. The indictor turns on for a split second, then switches the view.p  pany ideas on the correct way to do thisp

Negative 450 pIm currently writing a web application that provides some database manipulation. The system also needs to be capable working with different databases.The problem is that certain fields in the database have to be updated with data from a RESTful api.  To perform these updates, I use a Quartz.NET schedule that makes a job for every table that needs to be updated.This job checks if it needs to update the relevant database. If it does, it gets the information from the RESTservice. When I dont use multithreading, there are no problems with accessing the RESTserivce. But when I use Quartz.net, the server returns a 401 error for some requests. This behavior is inconstistent and doesnt always happen. Im using RestSharper to make these calls with a custom Authenticator for digest authentication.

Negative 450 pFirst things first, I apologize, since I know there are other questions related to this on StackOverflow already. Unfortunately, none of them seemed to have comprehensive answers, and others did not solve the issue I am having.p  pI am attempting to register for real time updates on Facebook for a strongpagestrong. Essentially, when an admin of a page posts a status update, or shares something, Id like to be notified about it.p  h2GRAPH API Versionh2  pBefore I begin, Id like to start out by saying that Im using strongFacebooks GRAPH API v2.3strong.

I cant imagine Facebook would just remove that feature, but at this point Im not ruling anything out. p  h2What Ive Tried So Far...h2  pI set up my app to have a strongTab Pagestrong component, and succesfully filled out all required information for this in the App Control Panel. This was required for my next step, which was adding the application as a tab to my page. p  pTo my understanding, it is required that my app be a tab on the page I am wanting updates for in order to receive updates for that page. Or at least, the page needs to have installed the app, which occurs when the app is added as a tabp  hr  pIve made a codePOSTcode request to codepageidtabscode to create a tab for my app on my page.

Negative 450 pComing from Python, where I would simply use type to find out the type of an object, C, lacking introspection, is forcing me to better grasp its data types, their relatedness, and pointers, before moving on to more advanced topics. strongThis is a good thingstrong. So I have the following piece of code, which I will tweak in various ways and try understand the resulting behaviorp  precodeint mainint argc, char argv[]      int i  0     fori  0 argv[1][i]  0 i           printfdn, argv[1][i]          char letter  argv[1][i]      switchletter          case 2             printfd 2n, i             break codepre  pIf I run this and pass the number 2 as a single argument, nothing happens. My understanding then is that because I have defined argva hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma4395891389110 titlehere1a[i] as a emcharem, comparing it to 2 an int will return false, hence the code does not get called. And indeed, if I change the case from 2 to 2, the code does get called. Makes sense, but it leads me to my first questionp  pstrongQ1.strong I have read in various places that to C, a character and an integer are essentially the same thing. strongSo why doesnt C know that the 2 passed as an argument should be interpreted as an integer and not a stringstrong After all, C allows me to, for example, use the d string formatter for characters.p  pIf I then change the type of variable emletterem from a char to an intp  precodeint letter  argv[1][i] codepre  p... I still get the same behavior as in the first variant i.e. nothing happens, even though now I am apparently comparing an int to and int in the case statement. This leads me to surmise that although I am defining emletterem now as an int, C is still reading it in as a char on the command line, and just calling it an int isnt enough to change its type from the point of view of subsequent program flow.p  pstrongQ2. Is the above reasoning correctstrongp  pSo now I figure that if I change the type of letter to an int using atoi, things should go OK. Sop  precodeint letter  atoiargv[1][i] codepre  pWhen I now try compile, I getp  precodeSwitch.c1427 warning incompatible integer to pointer conversion passing       char to parameter of type const char  take the address with amp       [Wintconversion]         int letter  atoiargv[1][i]                                                      amp usrincludestdlib.h13223 note passing argument to parameter here int      atoiconst char  codepre  pI then look up the documentation for atoi and see that it can only be used to converted a string a more precisely, a const char , not a character. I would have though that since a char  is just a sequence of chars, that atoi would work with both. And apparently there is no equivalent of atoi for a char, rather only workarounds, such as the one described a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma4395891389110 titlehereherea.p  pAnyway, I decide the take the warnings instructions, and place an ampersand before the value knowing that this implies a memory address, but not yet knowing why it is being suggested. Sop  precodeint letter  atoiampargv[1][i] codepre  pWhen I do so, it compiles. And now the program in this final form  with letter defined as an int, with the case statement comparing to an int, and with atoi being passed the address rather than value of codeargv[1][i]code  runs successfully.p  pBut I dont know why, so I strip this down to test the values of codeargv[1][i]code and codeampargv[1][i]code by printing them. I observe that the program will only compile if I use the s string formatter to print codeampargv[1][i]code, as it tells me that codeampargv[1][i]code is a char .p  pstrongQ3. Why is codeampargv[1][i]code, an address in memory, a char strongp  pIn my printout, I observe that the values of codeampargv[1][i]code and codeargv[1][i]code are the same, namely 2. Sop  pstrongQ4. Why didnt the compiler allow me to use codeargv[1][i]code, if its value is no different to that of codeampargv[1][i]codestrongp  pstrongQ5. Any time Ive printed a memory address in a C program, it has always been some long number such as 1246377222. Why is the memory address  the value in this casestrongp  pNo doubt there will be someone objecting that this mammoth post should be split into separate posts with separate questions, but I think the flow of trialanderror, and the answers you provide, will help not only me but others looking to understand these aspects of C. Also feel free to suggest a better title for the post.p  pMany thanks.p

Negative 450 pI am sitting programming an atminternetbank as a school assignment and i am wondering the safety of creating an object where you save a currentUser. The atm should be able to run at a laptop. To this atm assignment there is a related database. When you login with a matching username and password it saves the info with balance to the User object as currentUser. My question is, how safe is the password and especially the balance. Is it possible to manipulate with the info outside the program. Thinking of just getting the balance when needed directly from the database and directly updating the balance when something new has happened. Thanks in advance.p

Negative 450 pWell, Im working on a mobile application with ionic framework. In one of my views, the user can edit your name, password and also its image. For this I am using the CordovaFileTransfer plugin and it works great for me. Im managing to change the image and all the data I need. But not even like getting to change the data in my database, update the application. Let me explain.p  pWhen the user changes their image or their data, the web service response returns a status 1 if achievement make the change successfully and also the URL of the image and the new name change. This we have in localStorage variables and  rootScope within my application which update once it receives a status one from my server but to return to my dashboard application that is not updated, I close and open the application again and reflected the changes.

I can select items at will. I even have made some progress in eliminating already used items from the lists.

Negative 450 pI am currently trying to make a database for the place I work. We put partial social security numbers into the system to keep the patrons separate so we know who is who and I am trying to figure out if there is a way to make that easier. We are looking for a way to keep people from using the each others social security cards [something that does happen] so while I understand how to make a single column unique, I was wondering if there is a way to make it so that all of the SSN columns would be unique, as there would be multiple.p  pMain SSN Spouses SSN Childrens SSNsp  pSometimes there are up to seven or eight children and they all have to go in a separate column. So is there a way to make all of those SSN columns unique from each other And if not in Access, is there a program that does it We are currently using MyDatabase but I havent found a way to make anything unique in there.p
Negative 450 pThe origin of my question effectively stems from wanting to provide an implementation of pthreads on Windows which supports user provide stacks.  Specifically, codepthreadattrsetstackcode should do something meaningful.  My actual requirements are a bit more involved than this but this is good enough for the purpose of the post.p  pThere are no public Win APIs for providing a stack in either the Fiber or Thread APIs.  Ive searched around for sneaky backdoors, workarounds and hacks, theres nothing going.  In fact, I looked that the winpthread source for inspiration and that ignores any stack provided to codepthreadattrsetstackcode.  p  pInstead I tried the following solution to see if it would work.  I create a Fiber using the usual combination of codeConvertThreadToFibercode, codeCreateFiberExcode and codeSwitchToFibercode.  In codeCreateFiberExcode I provide a minimal stack size.  In the entry point of the fibre I then allocate memory for a stack, change the TIB fields Stack Base and Stack Limit appropriately see here a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiWin32ThreadInformationBlock relnofollowhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiWin32ThreadInformationBlocka and then set ESP to the high address of my stack.p  pIn a real world case I would setup the stack better than this and change EIP as well so that this step behaves more like the posix funciton codeswapcontextcode, but you get the idea.p  pIf I make any OS calls when on this different stack then Im pretty much screwed codeprintfcode for example dies.  However this isnt an issue for me.  I can ensure that I never make sure calls when on my custom stack hence why I said my actual requirements are a bit more involved.  Except...I need exceptions to work. And they dont  Specifically, if I try to throw and catch an exception on my modified stack then I get an assert p  blockquote   pUnhandled exception at 0xXXXXXXXX ....p blockquote  pSo my vague question is, does anyone have any insight as to how exceptions and a custom stack might not be playing nicely together  I appreciate that this is totally unsupported and can happily except nil response or go away.  In fact, Ive pretty much decided that I need a different solution and, despite this involving compromise, Im likely to use one.  However, curiosity gets the better of me so Id like to know why this doesnt work.p  pOn a related note, I wondered how Cygwin dealt with this for ucontext.  The source here a hrefhttpszupervigyor.ddsi.husourceinopenjdk66b181.8.13cacao0.99.4srcvmjiti386cygwinucontext.c relnofollowhttpszupervigyor.ddsi.husourceinopenjdk66b181.8.13cacao0.99.4srcvmjiti386cygwinucontext.ca uses codeGetThreadContextcodecodeSetThreadContextcode to implement ucontext.  However, from experimentation I see that this also fails when an exception is thrown from inside a new context.  In fact the codeSetThreadContextcode call doesnt even update the TIB blockp  pstrongEDIT based on the answer from avakarstrongp  pThe following code, which is very similar to yours, demonstrates the same failure.  The difference is that I dont start the second thread suspended but suspend it then try to change context.  This code exhibits the error I was describing when the trycatch block is hit in codefoocode.  Perhaps this simply isnt legal.  One notable thing is that in this situation the codeExceptionListcode member of the TIB is a valid pointer when codemodifyThreadContextcode is called, whereas in your example its 1.  Manually editing this doesnt help.p  pAs mentioned in my comment to your answer.  This isnt precisely what I need.  I would like to switch contexts from the thread Im current on.  However, the docs for codeSetThreadContextcode warn not to call this on an active thread.  So Im guessing that if the below code doesnt work then I have no chance of making it work on a single thread.p  precodenamespace  HANDLE ghSemaphore  0  void foo      try              throw 6          catch...

Negative 450 pI am trying to create a simple Win32 DLL that contains a function that will return, given the name of a processapp, a list of Window IDs of the apps main window. The most efficient way is to leverage the managed code Process.GetProcessesByName method. However, while the resulting DLL work in certain machine, it failed to be loaded into memory in other. Turn out the DLL is dynamically linked to a specific version of CRT library msvcr120.dll in specific. So if the target machine doesnt have the same version of CRT library installed, the DLL wont work. p  pI have tried to build the DLL by statically linked to the CRT library using the MT switch but the switch to enable CLR support for the managed code is incompatible with the MT switchp  pI have also tried to rid the DLL of CRT library altogether by using the NODEFAULTLIB switch and use just WINAPI calls. While I can build the nonmanaged portion of the DLL successfully with no dependency on CRT, but when I include the managed porton and turn the clr switch on, I am getting the following errorsp  pezeInstallScriptCA.obj  error LNK2001 unresolved external symbol .cctorFYMXXZ .cctorFYMXXZ .NETFramework,Versionv4.0.AssemblyAttributes.obj  error LNK2001 unresolved external symbol .cctorFYMXXZ .cctorFYMXXZp  pAnyone has suggestion how to create a WIN32 DLL that is version independent of CRT and it is CLR enabled in VCp  pThanks in advancep

I was thinking maybe there was some strange thing, like PHP was passing the values in the array by reference, or passing values of variables in general by reference and maybe that was causing problems, but I dont see that thats the case.  I cant see why setting the value of the following array position to the value Ive stored in temp would cause the program to eat up that much memory.  The loop in this case is only for an array with a count of 19.

Negative 450 pIve got an issue with an SSRS 2012 report rendering differently between environments and Im pretty sure that it is down to SSRS being at a different patch level. However, the one that works is on code11.0.2332code and the one that doesnt work is on code11.0.5058code. This is a problem as we dont want to downgrade the server upon which it doesnt work My next thought was to see if the version of SSRS tools that I am using to edit the report might be on a patch level that produces a report that renders fine on code11.0.2332code but not on code11.0.5058code. To throw more spice into the mix, my tools are version code11.0.3402code I get this from VS 2012 HelpAbout. Id like to get those tools up the same level as the server upon which it isnt working code11.0.5058code in the hope that editing the report with the patched tools will make the report work on code11.0.5058code. I installed SQL Server SP2 on my dev box but this did not upgrade the tools. I havent been able to find the relevant package that will do this upgrade. Any ideas Thanksp

Negative 450 pIm building a screen with fixed number of tabs 3, with a text size of 12sp and dynamically changing text and indicator color based on the selected tab. Do not want sliding tabs.p  pFor this, Im setting a custom text view while creating these tabs, since I want to change the text size there doesnt seem to be any method to change text size in TabLayout and text color. Now, how do I retrieve the text view attached to these tabsp  pIt would have been a lot easier had Android Design Librarys TabLayout exposed these methods.p  ol liSet Indicator Colorli liSet Indicator Heightli liChanging text sizeli liGet Custom Text Viewli ol  pI did a workaround for 1 and 2 by using reflection not sure if thats the best way.

Negative 450 pFrom a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7058737isepollthreadsafethis questiona I know that I can call codeepollctl2code while another thread is blocking on codeepollwait2code.

Negative 450 pIm trying to create a rest service that can accept both http and https traffic. The reason for this is that my company offers our customers both a hosted and nonhosted solution.

Negative 450 pI have a form containing a bunch of time sheet entries. Now most of these entries are related to some kind of job we have running through the shop, but not always. When there is, you just pop the job ID into the corresponding time sheet entry and a lot of relevant information about the job is displayed  which is necessary. p  pHowever, my problem occurs when a time sheet entry DOES NOT relate to a specific job. I still want to use the same form and mechanisms to input the entry, but if the entry isnt supplied with a Job ID, Access tells me that it cant find a record in the Job table that corresponds with the entry. It will not let me save the record at that point. p  pSo Jobs have a onetomany relationship with the timesheet entries, but only when a relationship exists at all. How do I make Access not freak out when a Job ID isnt supplied Ive already checked the relationship and it is not enforcing referential integrity. Also the Job ID field is not marked as required in the time sheet entries table. p

Negative 450 pIve got a fairly lengthy question about how to design an application, and would appreciate any input.p  pThe application Im working on needs to allow a user to create tasks for their clientone user has one or many clients. These tasks will create push notifications on the clients device at the due at time specified. The client will then either mark it as completed, not completed, or ignore it. Those responses completed, not completed, no response will be logged by the application that created the push notifications. The tasks being created can have a schedule, or be standalone. The schedules can be nonterminating. For this reason, the current design is that the initial task object contains its own schedule, and the repeated tasks generated by the schedule for the purposes of sending push notifications, and displaying them to the user on the schedule page are nonpersisted. p  pIm trying to tackle the problem of how to track which tasks repeated nonpersisted instances have been completed. Currently, a separate model for responses has been created. Each instance of that model corresponds to a single completednot completedno response reply that the application receives. This is causing me a lot of problems, namely how to track which response object corresponds to a tasks repeated nonpersisted instance, and how to record the response for the nonpersisted instances. Currently, the only way to get the repeated nonpersisted instances is to call a method on the initial persisted task object, and give it a date range. This returns an array of the nonpersisted dummy tasks, that share all the same attributes as the original, including ID, the only difference being the due at attribute, which is when the push notification will fire. p  pWhat Im wondering is if there is a better way to handle the responses. Another possibility Ive considered is having an array of hashes on the persisted task object, which would contain the due at time of the nonpersisted instance, and the reply it received.p  pI hope Ive explained this thoroughly and concisely enough, and I really appreciate any input I can get on the correct way to solve this. p

Negative 450 pI had a UINavigationController set as initial view controller. The root view controller for that navigation controller shows a menu where users can see product categories In case thats interesting for anyone . The root view controller loads JSON data from an URL, so it takes a little while until the view shows up which is fine. That data will be use in all the app, so its an important step.p  pWell, since the data load takes a while, I added a new UIViewController where I show an image with an UIActivityIndicator. Of course, the data load takes place in this UIViewController now instead of the root view controller.p  pSo, the idea is that after the data is loaded, the root view controller takes the place. To accomplish this I put an invisible UIButton on the new view controller and added a UIStoryboardSegue to the navigation controller, so I trigger that segue programmatically after the data is loaded.p  pAfter the data gets loaded, the navigation controller actually appears and shows of course the root view controller. The problem is when I click any button on the root view controller, the segue performs correctly, but from the second view controller UITableViewController if I press any cell, it takes me back to the new view controller the one that shows an image and loads the data. Well not actually any cell, because sometimes  it takes me actually forwards to the third view controller also UITableViewController, but the same problem occurs in this view controller. If I click the back button on the navigation bar in any view controller, it takes me back to the new view controller and not really back in the navigation stack.p  pHere is ViewDidLoadp  precodeoverride func viewDidAppearanimated Bool      super.viewDidAppearanimated      load.loadAllProducts     load.loadCategories      self.performSegueWithIdentifiermainStoryboardSegue, sender self  codepre  pAnd PrepareForSeguep  precodeoverride func prepareForSeguesegue UIStoryboardSegue, sender AnyObject      let destination  segue.destinationViewController as UINavigationController     let homeViewController  destination.viewControllers.first as HomeViewController     homeViewController.categories  load.categories     homeViewController.products  load.products  codepre  pI really appreciate any help, thanks a lotp

And I want to explicitly instantiate this function template for codeintcode.p  pSo I wrote in the larger.h the followingp  precodetemplate lttypename Tgt const Tamp largerT a,T b codepre  pI wrote in larger.cpp the followingp  precodeincludeltiostreamgt includelarger.h const Tamp largerT a,T b      return altbba  codepre  pIn the main.cppp  precodeincludeltiostreamgt include larger.h int main     template int     constamp largerltintgtint,int     stdcout ltlt larger6,8 ltlt stdendl  codepre  pWhen I compile and try to run main.cpp,I get the following errorp  precodeerror expected primaryexpression before template  template int codepre  pI am unable to proceed further.

Negative 450 pIm liking LightInject after looking at its features in a hrefhttpwww.palmmedia.deblog2011830ioccontainerbenchmarkperformancecomparison relnofollowoccontainerbenchmarkperformancecomparisona. It has a good set of features including interception and its fastp  pAnd your documentation is pretty good. One thing that works well is the serviceRegistry.Register configuration strategy.p  pBut Im using that to set up a container full of references for functionality provided by DLLs that are instantiated in an MS MVC web app. And I dont see explicit discussions about that scenario.p  pHow can I set up the registration and the PerRequest scoping so that all the lifetimes are within the httpcontext lifecyclep  pIm guessing that the serviceRegistry registrations in the classes deriving from ICompositionRoot will not automatically be recognized if the perrequest scope is configured in the methods of the web app.p  pAnd thanks for your excellent tool Kimball Johnsonp
Negative 450 pLets say I have a site with a central div, approximately 50 of the width of the window, with other divs either side of it filling up the remaining space. The spanning divs are fixed, and dont move, nor can they scroll.p  pAt the moment, when my mouse is over one of the spanning divs, I naturally cant scroll the central div. My question is this is there a way to ALWAYS have scroll focus on a particular div, no matter where the mouse is located on the pagep  pEDIT What I actually have is thisp  precodeltdiv idwrappergt     ltnav idsidebargtltnavgt     ltdiv idrhsgtltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pwhere wrapper and sidebar both have position fixed, and sidebar and rhs are adjacent in the center of wrapper i.e. margin 0 auto to sit them in the middle. Scrolling with my mouse over either wrapper or sidebar does not scroll rhs, despite the positions being fixed so Toni Leighs answer doesnt work for me here.p
Negative 450 pI have a new project, and i dont know where to start.p  pAt the moment i havep  ol liDevice that send data on commands to the serverli liClint which send the commandsli liServer who must share and store the datali ol  pDevice 1 synchrone always connect every 3 minutes if it is online to the server, and send the asked data on a command.p  pNow the problem  The clint have to send the commands, and has to wait for its device. For this i have to make a smartcard authentication, and i dont know whats the best way to handle it.p  pThis works as followp  ol liThe client push a command to the server.li liThe server wait for the device when it is online, it start the process.li liThe device send a key backli liThis key needs the clint, to complete the authentication.li liClint send the authentication key to the serverli liThe server send the key to the device.li lidoneli ol  pWhat is the best way to handle a async clint and sync devices with one server.p  pThe clint is write in c Windowsp  pThe Device Daemon is write in PHP Unixp  pNow the question how can i handle them together. I prefer to see them separated because the device info is realy important.p  pif there some books about a similar project PHP, i like to hear that.p  pI already made a test case with sharedmemory what works, but maby there are better solutions.p  pSorry for my bad english, and already thanks p
Negative 450 pI am new to c and mono. and I encountered a strange question. I have 2 projects in my solution. and one is dependent on another one called CoreLogic. Ive already set up the dependency and the compilation is successful. However, when I run it and sent it a request, the program throws an exception likep  blockquote   pserver Error Could not load type Logic.RedisStorage from assembly   CoreLogic, Version1.0.5750.32870, Cultureneutral,   PublicKeyTokennull.p blockquote  pthe strangest thing is that I can see the Logic.RedisStorage class is present in the assembly CoreLogic of xamarin studio. but the program still complains. So, what is wrong here a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comPHAbB.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comPHAbB.png altenter image description hereap  pstrongEDITstrong Ive tried to readd the dependency of CoreLogic, but it turns out no luck. here is what the mono has complained a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comGLTfU.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comGLTfU.png altenter image description hereap  pthe assembly version does match what server is dependentI can not upload imgs right now, so check following link for detailp  pa hrefhttpswww.evernote.comlAPWLUXOQa5pAxrm3MUZDhxZ88KkJ2Y5bhl0 relnofollowhttpswww.evernote.comlAPWLUXOQa5pAxrm3MUZDhxZ88KkJ2Y5bhl0ap
