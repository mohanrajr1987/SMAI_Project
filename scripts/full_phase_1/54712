Negative 54712 pIve recently inherited an application that makes very heavy use of session, including storing a lot of custom data objects in session. One of my first points of business with this application was to at least move the session data away from InProc, and off load it to either a stateserver or SQL Server.p  pAfter I made all of the appropriate data objects serializable, and changed the web.config to use a state service, everything appeared to work fine. p  pHowever, I found that this application does a lot of object comparisons using GetHashCode. Methods that worked fine when the session was InProc no longer work because the HashCodes no longer match when they are supposed to. This appears to be the case when trying to find a specific child object from a parent when you know the child objects original hash codep  pIf I simply change the web.config back to using inproc, it works again.p  pAnyone have any thoughts on where to begin with thisp  phr p  pEDIT p  pqbeuek thanks for the quick reply. In regards top  blockquote   pThe default implementation of GetHashCode in Object class return a hash value based on objects address in memory or something similar. If some other identity comparison is required, you have to override both Equals and GetHashCode.p blockquote  pI should have given more information on how they are using this. Basically, they have one parent data object, and there are several arrays of child objects. They happen to know the hash code for a particular object they need, so they are looping through a specific array of child objects looking for a hash code that matches. Once a match is found, they then use that object for other work.p

Negative 54712 pI have a PHP script setup using Jquery .post which would return a response or do an action within the targeted .php file within .post.p  pEg. My page has a form where you type in your Name. Once you hit the submit form button, .post is called and sends the entered Name field value into mywebsite.xyzfolderajaxscript.phpp  pIf a user was to visit mywebsite.xyzfolderajaxscript.php directly and somehow POST the data to the script, the script would return a response  do an action, based on the submitted POST data.p  pThe problem is, I dont want others to be able to periodically call an action or request a response from my website without using the website directly. Theoretically, right now you could determine what Name values my website allows without even visiting it, or you could call an action without going through the website, by simply visiting mywebsite.xyzfolderajaxscript.phpp  pSo, what measures can I take to prevent this from happening So far my idea is to ensure that it is a POST and not a GET  so they cannot manually enter it into the browser, but they could still post data to the script...p  pAnother measure is to apply a session key that expires, and is only valid for X amount of visits until they revisit the website.  Or, just have a daily code that changes and theyd need to grab this code from the website each day to keep their direct access to the script working eg. I pass the daily code into each post request. I then check that code matches in the ajax php script.p  pHowever, even with these meaures, they will STILL have access to the scripts so long as they know how to POST the data, and also get the new code each day. Also, having a daily code requirement will cause issues when visiting the site at midnight 1200am as the code will change and the script will break for someone who is on the website trying to call the script, with the invalid code being passed still.p  pI have attempted using .htaccess however using strongorder allow,deny deny from allstrongp  pPrevents legitimate access, and Id have to add an exception so the websites IP is allowed to access it.. which is a hassle to update I think. Although, if its the only legitimate solution I guess Ill have to.p  pstrongIf I need to be more clear please let me know.strongp

Depending on the technology used OpenGl, DirectX, GDI, it hooks the Vsync and does its capture with glReadPixels,..., without perturbing it.  Doing this does not solve my problem, since I want the full composed screen image including 3D and the rest AND a smooth 3D app.p  pThe UScreenCapture seems to use a fast DirectX call to capture the whole screen, but the openGL 3D app is still out of sync.p  pDoing a BitBlt is too slow and CPU consumming to do real time 30 fps acquisition at least under windows XP, not sure with 7p  pMy question is to know if there is a way to achieve my goal with Windows 7 and its brand new DirectX compositing enginep  pWindows 7 succeeds to show live VSynced duplicated previews of every app in the taskbar, so there must be a way to access the currenlty displayed screen buffer without perturbing the rendering of the 3D OpenGL app p  pAny other suggestion, technology  thank youp

Negative 54712 pI have a treelike model where in strongall situations but onestrong, I want to scope the results to only return the roots.p  precodeclass Licence lt ActiveRecordBase   defaultscope conditions gt  parentlicenceid, nil     belongsto parentlicence, classname gt Licence   hasmany nestedlicences, classname gt Licence,            foreignkey gt parentlicenceid, dependent gt destroy end  class User lt ActiveRecordBase   hasmany licences end codepre  pUsing codedefaultscopecode seemed like an awesome idea because the various models which have associations to Licence there are about 4 of them and also any code using find, would not need to do anything special.  The reason it emisntem an awesome idea is that the default scope also applies to the codehasmanycode, which results in never finding the children.  But the codehasmanycode is the emonlyem place which needs to bust out of the scope, so as far as default behaviour goes, I think this codedefaultscopecode is quite reasonable.p  pSo is there some good way to get around this specific problemp  pHere is one which I am not too fond of because it uses SQL for a nearly trivial queryp  precodehasmany nestedlicences, classname gt Licence, dependent gt destroy,   findersql gt SELECT l. FROM licences l WHERE l.parentlicenceid  id,   countersql gt SELECT COUNTl. FROM licences l WHERE l.parentlicenceid  id codepre  pAlternatively is there some way to apply a named scope to an association from the model  e.g. something along the lines of this nonsensecodep  precodeclass Licence lt ActiveRecordBase   namedscope roots, conditions gt  parentlicenceid, nil     belongsto parentlicence, classname gt Licence   hasmany nestedlicences, classname gt Licence,            foreignkey gt parentlicenceid, dependent gt destroy end  class User lt ActiveRecordBase   hasmany licences, scope gt roots    a scope option doesnt really exist end codepre  pI know I can also do thisp  precodeclass Licence lt ActiveRecordBase   namedscope roots, conditions gt  parentlicenceid, nil     belongsto parentlicence, classname gt Licence   hasmany nestedlicences, classname gt Licence,            foreignkey gt parentlicenceid, dependent gt destroy end  class User lt ActiveRecordBase   hasmany licences, conditions gt  parentlicenceid, nil  end codepre  pBut that really isnt very DRY.  Actually having to do every single query through codeLicence.roots.findcode instead of codeLicence.findcode isnt very DRY either, to be honest.  Its just asking for a bug to occur where the scope isnt used.p

Ive read a hrefhttpgroups.google.comgroupandroiddevelopersbrowsethreadthreada2aac88a08cb56c2b7dff4ba388cd664lnkgstampqSurfaceViewb7dff4ba388cd664httpgroups.google.comgroupandroiddevelopersbrowsethreadthreada2aac88a08cb56c2b7dff4ba388cd664lnkgstampqSurfaceViewb7dff4ba388cd664a which sort of answers my question but as far as I can tell, its a sort of tough luck answer. So heres my problemp  pIm using SurfaceView in the normal way lockunlockAndPost to draw a bitmap of my game background whenever the surface is changed e.g. orientation etc and Im rendering a series of moving circles up to 30 with a radius of about 25.f. The x,y data for the positions of these circles is coming from a server and that all runs fine.  All circle objects are stored in a list and their position is updated taking care to ensure this update is synchronized.  However, when I draw these circles to the screen during canvas.lock , most of the time they render fine but occasionally e.g. once every few seconds some of the circles seem to tear or flicker briefly for a frame. The number of circles is always constant so thats not the problem and theres no concurrent modifications to the list of circles as I said, it is synchronized.  I have even tried drawing all these circles to a Bitmap on each  render loop and drawing that bitmap to the main canvas. This just seems to affect the perfomance even more 13FPS as opposed to 30FPS when drawing circles directly to main canvas.  Sorry if the information is a little vague guys, trying to keep the company happy p  but I was just wondering if anyone could give me a clue Or am I just out of luck. I should note that the positioning data coming from the server is realtime data and it is vitally important that the rendering reflects these realtime positions.p  pThanks for any help Chrisp  pEDITp  pFair enough.

Negative 54712 pI am currently working on an internal settings menu for my app I know the global one for all application settings. For the Menu I am using the Three20 lib.p  pMy question Is there a table cell for Three20 TTTableViewController which looks like the cells in the global preferences menu What I need is a cell with a caption on the left side, the value on the right side and also a accessory item on the right side. I didnt find anything like that.p  pAnother thing is, that the builtin table cells in the Three20 lib wont display any accessory item. I also set the value for the URL propert to something like ttblablabla and I am reacting on the url forwardings, but the accessory items arent displayed.p  pThanks for your helpp  pC YAp

Negative 54712 pHi Dr. Nickp  pIm trying to tighten things up for our app admin, and in a few places we have some pretty skeezy code.p  pFor example, we have Markets, which contain Deals.

Negative 54712 pIve inherited the maintenance of some scientific computing using Parallel Python on a cluster.

Negative 54712 pI have a table to store data for the phones and it has about 50 columns .......... should be inserted on average 30 million phones in one year ........ however, it is necessary to store a history of these phones, for example, if I want to change a field in a phone at a given date, latter I need to know at any given time, the values that had this phone. It occurred to me to have a historical and a main table, where in the main, I have the latest values of the cell, and in the historical all the changes that were made. Now this is a duplication of data, because if you change only one field, I insert into the historical table all the values, even those not changed, and in the main,this last record, so the historical table will grow enormously. how could I manage to not store too much information that may not be changed and retrieve data from a phone at any given time.p

Negative 54712 pI have an AJAX  prototype related question. I have an AJAX call currently placed inline, in the onclick i promise ill move it out of there  event, looking like thisp  precodeonclickvar pn  yards.value inventory.updateWorking... new Ajax.Updaterinventory,ajax.phpaccheckInventoryampproductID.someproductid.ampyardspn,methodget, evalScripts true, asynchronous true, onCompletefunctiontrinventory.updatetr.responseText codepre  pFile called ajax.php then gets the data from GET[], displays a small text input field. When filled in and clicked on a submit button, it calls a function which reads the relevant data from the file, and prints a result on the screen. The purpose of all this code is inventory check.p  pSo, when a user clicks on the get inventory button with the onclick defined as above, everything works nice, the user fills the yardage, the right result pops up, everybody happy. But what makes it less usable is the fact that in case a user wants to do stronganother inventory checkstrong, the entire page needs to be refreshed. If its not, then when clicking on get inventory button, the user will be getting the same result of the last check again, not the text input field.p  pSo, my question is, how do I make that after one inventory check, the whole thing sort of resets itself so that the next time a user clicks on get inventory button, hell be offered to fill the text input field again, and hence get the new result.p  pIm sorry if I didnt make myself clear enough. Im very new to AJAX and prototype, and this is my colleagues work I need to finish...Thanksp

News will list all sorted news items. Events will list events in a potentially arbitrary order i.e. userweighted. Volunteer will be a form that will send an email to the volunteer manager.p  pThese volunteertype, dataentry forms are going to be used in multiple places throughout the website and Id like it to be rather simple for users to create these forms and get the data back from them either through email or a backend interface.Furthermore, a section should be capable of having both forms and normal pages.p  pI dont know how well written this post is but thats the gist of it. Normally Id choose Drupal but Im not sure the person managing the website is going to be able to use it without having to come back to me constantly although I might revert to it depending on whats available.p  pI was wondering what other recommendations you guys have for a system thats easy and intuitive but powerful enough to handle what I listed above.p  pI should note that while Id prefer it to be a PHPbased CMS any opensource CMS should suffice for this project.p
Negative 54712 pI have a question regarding the Facebook API and would like to gain some insight into nuts and bolts of the Facebook API.p  pIm planning to write an App in PHP. This would be a birthday alert app. A user would visit our website, login wih their Facebook Account and done  We send them alerts as and when their friends have birthdays.p  pHow can this app work in the background because connections for a user keeps on changing. We cannot store all the data in a database because of two things p  precode 1 Constantly evolving connections  2 Violates Facebook Terms. codepre  pWe need to be able to store only the UIDs of the users and then use that UID to somehow fetch a users connections and their corresponding date of birth on a daily basis. p  pPlease let me know if this can be done or not, Because what ive learnt so far of the Facebook API, well need an Access Token to access a users personal information. And this Access Token is persistent only for the time until heshe is logged in.p  pIm sure there might be some other way to achieve this that i might have overlooked.p  pI would highly appreciate if any of you could guide me in the right direction.p

Negative 54712 pI am basically familiar with RPC solutions available in Python XMLRPC and Pyro. I can make an remote object by binding it on the serverside and then I can get proxy object on the client side on which I can operate. When I call some method on remote object e.g. proxy.getfile then the rpc mechanism tries to serialize a resultant object a file in this case. This is usually expected behavior, but what I need is to get a file object as another remote proxy object instead of getting it transferred to client sidep  precodeafileproxy  proxy.getfile codepre  pInstead ofp  precodeafile  proxy.getfile codepre  pI could rebind this object on serverside and handle such case on the client side but this would require some boilerplate code. Is there a mechanismlibrary that would do this for me It could for example keep objects remote until they are primitive ones.p

Negative 54712 pI am creating a binary editor for some very large binary files.  One of the software requirements is that the editor cannot modify the original file, so the target file must be an edited copy of the original. p  pI want to design the editor in such a way that copying of the file only takes place once it will be a 20 minute process.  I know that I can lock the file while it is being edited, but if the user exits the program, they will have to go through the whole 20 minute copy process over again, unless I can find a way to determine that they are still in their original editing session.p  pIs there some simple process you can think of by which I can allow the user to register the copied file somehow as an editable file, and when they are completed with all of their changes, finalize the file  p  pIdeally, such a process would allow me to emdetect whether or not the editable file or the transaction information has been tampered withem inbetween editing sessions tampering or finalization would cause another copy to occur, if the file is edited again.p

Negative 54712 pHi I have a question on possible stack optimization by gcc or g..p  pSample code under FreeBSD does UNIX variance matter herep  precodevoid main     char bing[100]    ..    string buffer  ....    ..  codepre  pWhat I found in gdb for a coredump of this program is that the address of bing is actually lower than that buffer namely, ampbing[0] lt ampbuffer.p  pI think this is totally the contrary of was told in textbook. Could there be some compiler optimization that reorganize the stack layout in such a wayp  pThis seems to be only possible explanation but Im not sure..p  pIn case youre interested, the coredump is due to the buffer overflow by bing to buffer but that also confirms ampbing[0] lt ampbuffer.p  pThanksp

Negative 54712 pIm currently trying to bind the DataGrid.ItemsSource to a custom RowCollection, which implements IList and INotifyCollectionChangedp  pcodePublic Class RowCollectionof Tbr     Implements IListOf Tbr     Implements INotifyCollectionChangedbr Private List As New ListOf Tbr ...codep  pSorry for the VB code, Ill be translating all my code to C soon.p  pNotice the class strongdoes notstrong derive from any existing CLR collection.

Negative 54712 pI have a main menu with an action bar.  On create, I run a thread that hits my server for a current status.

I know the function to remove the default message on click from a form, but the problem thats occuring is that after a user has initially clicked in the message area to remove the default, if they then click in the message area again, it removes what theyve written I guess an example would be if they noticed a spelling mistake or need to change part of their message.p  pThere must be a way to solve thisp  pThe code for the text area isp  precodelttextarea namemessage idmessage rows9 cols55 tabindex9   onclickthis.valuegt   ltphp ifisseterror echo message else echo Please use this area for any other information about your enquirygt lttextareagt codepre

Negative 54712 pI am trying to modify CodaSlider 2.0 httpwww.ndoherty.biztagcodaslider to use percentagebased widths, instead of hardcoded pixel widths, to allow for fluid resizing. Ive gotten it to work fabulously, except for a small glitch in IE7 Firefox does not exhibit this behavior when I try and move back to panel 1.p  pWhen I run the default index.html that comes with codaslider 2.0, everything works fine in IE7. I then sub in images instead of the default text and that works fine as well. I then changed the CSS and JS to use percentage widths  this works great, except for when I try and return back to the first panel  when I do that, say, from panel 4, instead of smoothly animating back to panel 1 the view jumps instantly to halfway between panel 1 and panel 2, and THEN animates back to panel 1.p  pThis can be seen at a test site I set upp  pa hrefhttpwww.lootcorp.comanimateissue relnofollowhttpwww.lootcorp.comanimateissueap  pThe source of the modified CodaSlider JS file I am using is below. Note I stripped out all nonessential code to simplify debugging.p  pThe problem is tied to the linep  precodeoffset   panelWidthz   codepre  pI thought maybe the animation didnt like getting fed 0 as a value, so I tried feeding it 0 and 0px when panel 1 was selected  same result. The end result is correct  eventually the div is positioned properly at marginleft 0, but I have no idea why it skips to a position halfway between panel 1 and 2 before doing so. Animation from panel 4 to 3 or 2 works fine. I tried using left instead of marginleft with the same results.p  pBug or stupid, overlooked mistake Any advice is greatly appreciatedp  pjs file sourcep  precode    function      Remove the codaslidernojs class from the body     body.removeClasscodaslidernojs      Preloader     .codaslider.children.panel.hide.end.prependltp classloadinggtLoading...ltbr gtltimg srcimagesajaxloader.gif altloading... gtltpgt   var sliderCount  1  .fn.codaSlider  functionsettings       settings  .extend         autoHeight true,         autoHeightEaseDuration 1000,         autoHeightEaseFunction easeInOutExpo,         autoSlide false,         autoSlideInterval 7000,         autoSlideStopWhenClicked true,         crossLinking true,         dynamicArrows true,         dynamicArrowLeftText amp171 left,         dynamicArrowRightText right amp187,         dynamicTabs true,         dynamicTabsAlign center,         dynamicTabsPosition top,         externalTriggerSelector a.xtrig,         firstPanelToLoad 1,         panelTitleSelector h2.title,         slideEaseDuration 1000,         slideEaseFunction easeInOutExpo     , settings      return this.eachfunction           var slider  this           var panelCount  slider.find.panel.size          var panelWidth  100         var panelContainerWidth  400          var navClicks  0  Used if autoSlideStopWhenClicked  true           Surround the collection of panel divs with a container div wide enough for all panels to be lined up endtoend         .panel, slider.wrapAllltdiv classpanelcontainergtltdivgt          Specify the width of the container div wide enough for all panels to be lined up endtoend         .panelcontainer, slider.css width panelContainerWidth            Specify the current panel.

Negative 54712 pIm having memory leak issues with a third party c dll.  For certain calls, the dll allocates memory for the string, passes it out as a char and then expects to receive that pointer back so that it can deallocate the memory.p  pHere are some comments from the header file, a couple of examples of where the char get returned, and the signature of the Release method.p  pThe dll is called SWAPI, its from a trade clearing house  if anyone has perhaps wrapped this already Id love to talk to them.p  precode    Strings returned by the API are similarly normal nulterminated C strings.     The user should not attempt to change any of the bytes or read past the     terminating nul of any returned string.

Knowing that javascript does not deal with binary very well, all the data is comming back is in C structs What are my options p  pMy biggest concern is that having to send the messages via ASCII.  Ideally what I want is a way to send my messages via the C struct and have my gui read them efficiently without having to convert expensive. p  pI have read the Websocket api and it does not seem to be geared for what I want to do.  Are there any other technologies that would do what I am looking for while allowing me to use all the nice javascript uivisualization code.p  pThanksp
Negative 54712 pIve been working on this problem all day and Im ready to pull my hair out.  I found some answers here and on the web that say that this is caused by trying to do something with a View within the thread instead of in the UI thread.  But Ive tried all of the ideas handlernew thread that Ive seen and still cant get it to work.  I programmed in C for many years as a hobby and now Im a newbie at JavaAndroid.  Im programming with Eclipse and the Android 2.1 platform.  I want my application to work with as many of the Android phones as possible and I think all of the features that Im using are compatible with API 1. I also saw that there is something called AsyncTask, but will that cause a problem with people who have old phonesp  pSo here is what my app does.  When I click on a button, the app goes online to a website and downloads an xmlrss feed.  Then it parses it and puts the data into a listview using a custom adapter that I created.  The downloading and parsing can take anywhere from 1 second to 15 seconds, so I wanted to add a progress dialog.  After adding that, that is where I started getting the error message in the title of this post. The app does the downloading successfully my example xml file on the web has 8 records in it so its very small but then I see the error before the listview is displayed.  So I guess I need to know exactly which part of the view is causing the error, and then how to fix it.p  pHere is the code I have removed all of my testing code from the last few hours so it is clean and will be less confusing to all of you... and mep  precodeSuppressWarningsserial public class ClubMessageList extends ListActivity implements Serializable  private static final String TAG  DGMS News private ArrayListltCMessagegt mmessages  null private MessageAdapter madapter private ProgressDialog mProgressDialog  null  private Runnable downloadMessages  Need handler for callbacks to the UI thread final Handler mHandler  new Handler  SuppressWarningsunchecked Override public void onCreateBundle icicle      Log.iTAG, Starting the ClubMessageList activity     super.onCreateicicle      setContentViewR.layout.list     setTitleDGMS News  Clubs      try               check to see if we already have downloaded messages available in the bundle         mmessages  ArrayListltCMessagegt icicle  null  null  icicle.getSerializablesavedMessages           if there are no messages in the bundle, download them from the web and then display them         if mmessages  null                      mmessages  new ArrayListltCMessagegt             this.madapter  new MessageAdapterthis, R.layout.rowclub, ArrayListltCMessagegt mmessages             setListAdapterthis.madapter              downloadMessages  new Runnable                 public void run                      getMessages                                           Thread thread   new Threadnull, downloadMessages, DownloadMessages             thread.start             mProgressDialog  ProgressDialog.showClubMessageList.this,                       Please wait..., Retrieving 2010 Show data ..., true                  else  messages were already downloaded, so display them in the listview dont download them again                      Log.iDGMS News, Starting activity again.

Negative 54712 pI want to keep a large ordered list millions of elements in Google App Engine datastore. Fast insertion is required.p  pThe simplest way would be adding an indexed property or column ordernum representing the order. For example, a list [A, B, C] would be stored like thisp  precodecontent   ordernum     A         1    B         2    C         3   codepre  pHowever, this doesnt give you fast insertion. For example, If I want to insert X after A, I have to renumber B and C to make room for X, i.e., let B become 3, C becomes 4, and X be 2. This would be a disaster if I have millions of elements.p  pI found a feasible solution called gap approach described a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions330482bestwaytosaveaorderedlisttothedatabasewhilekeepingtheorderingherea. This approach keeps a gap between adjacent elements. Like thisp  precodecontent   ordernum     A         1000    B         2000    C         3000 codepre  pWhen I want to insert X after A, I can simply add X with its ordernum set to 1000  2000  2  1500, no renumbering required.p  pBut with these gaps becoming smaller, renumbering may be required. My question is, is there any known strategy on renumbering And deciding the size of gapsp  pThanksp  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pHeres more detail. Say I have a list of elements in database, and every element has an integer property named mynum. The value of mynum is an arbitrary positive integer. Suppose I have a list [A, B, C, D], and their mynum arep  precode element    mynum        A          5            B          2    C         10    D          7 codepre  pNow, lets define an accum operatorp  precodeaccumn  element[0].mynum  element[1].mynum  ...  element[n1].mynum codepre  pSo the accum values for each element arep  precode element    mynum   accum      A          5        5    B          2        7    C         10       17    D          7       24 codepre  pBut accum values probably should NOT be stored in database because the list is constantly updated.

If i add inline styling then it works perfectly in safari as well.

Negative 54712 pThis question mightmight not be related to programming but there is a huge number of programmers that might know what it is.p  pWe have published ASP.NET MVC2 web application that uses Linq on the web server with IIS 7.5.  This web application is automatically copied and served by 2 other servers thanks to Distributed File System set on all 3 servers.  So in total there are 3 web servers on 3 different machines with load balancer configured.p  pNow with this configuration our web application does some weird stuff as processing transaction where there are two inserts to two tables and data is inserted only into one table or it does simple select by id which is primary key and returns more than one record. Also there are some conversion problems and others.p  pThe problem appears only when there is a huge amount of visitors hitting  the website. Otherwise is fine. The very curious thing is when there is only one server switched on and the other 2 are shut down all works finebit slower even with huge volume of usersstress test. No errors no exceptions.p  pAlso we run stress test on the static page which doesnt retrieve any data form db with all 3 servers on and it also works.p  pHas anyone else had this issuep  pFor the web application we use C Asp.Net MVC2, repository pattern, linq to sql Server MS Windows 2008 R2, MS SQL 2008 R2p

Negative 54712 pWhen a web server gets a POST of a form, parsing it into paramvalues pairs is quite straightforward. However, if the values contain nonEnglish chars that have been encoded by the browser, it must know the charset used in order to decode them.p  pIve examined the requests sent by two posts. One was done from a page using UTF8, and one from a page using Windows1255. The same text was encoded differently. AFAIK, the Contenttype header could contain a charset after the codeapplicationxwwwformurlencodedcode, but it wasnt using Firefox.p  pIn a servlet, when you use coderequest.getParametercode, youre supposed to get the decoded value. How does the servlet container do that Does it always bet on UTF8, use some heuristics, or is there some deterministic way Im missingp

Negative 54712 pI have just implemented a codeWeakEventDelegatecode class in .NET.p  pI had seen other articles to the effect of implementing such a thing in a hrefhttpcode.logos.comblog200808eventsubscriptionusingweakreferences.html relnofollowhttpcode.logos.comblog200808eventsubscriptionusingweakreferences.htmla and a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.combgregschechterarchive20040527143605.aspx relnofollowhttpblogs.msdn.combgregschechterarchive20040527143605.aspxap  pHowever, the implementation I arrived at is less complicated though less flexible, and seems to do the job, so I was wondering whether there was something I had missed.p  pIs there any problem with the following implementation, except for its relative lack of flexibilityp  precodepublic class WeakEventDelegateltTEventArgsgt      where TEventArgs  EventArgs      private readonly WeakReference handlerReference      public WeakEventDelegateActionltobject, TEventArgsgt handler              handlerReference  new WeakReferencehandler           public void Handleobject source, TEventArgs e              Actionltobject, TEventArgsgt unwrappedHandler  Actionltobject, TEventArgsgthandlerReference.Target         if unwrappedHandler  null                      unwrappedHandler.Invokesource, e                codepre  pstrongEDITstrong My only intent in writing that class was to prevent the implicit reference from the publisher to the delegate to prevent garbage collecting of the subscriber.p  pMeaning that, instead of writingp  precodevoid subscribe      publisher.RaiseCustomEvent  this.HandleCustomEvent  codepre  pI would writep  precodeprivate readonly WeakDelegateltCustomEventArgsgt customHandler  new WeakDelegateltCustomEventArgsgtthis.HandleCustomEvent void subscribe      publisher.RaiseCustomEvent  customHandler.Handle  codepre  pThe main usecase I have in mind for that class is for a few collection classes subscribers that have a lifetime that I can only barely control.

Negative 54712 pAre there any librariesetc. that implement lightweight text compression in JavaScriptp  pMy real goal is to slightly shorten some text and make it inconspicuous at a glance.  It neednt provide security  the text will be displayed for the user.  Ideally the compression could be tweaked to output only the query charactersp  precode[.amp,azAZ09] codepre  pso it can be passed in a URL.  Actually, this is kind of important  if other characters are used theyd have to be percentencoded, which will probably make the text larger than the original.  Of course rare characters could be percentencoded if needed.p  pAny ideas  Failing that, suggestions for making a simple one  The compression doesnt have to be great but shorter URLs would be nicer.  The text to be compressed should be English sentences mostly lowercase letters, spaces, and punctuation with the occasional uppercase letters, digits, and newlines.p

If you are sure youre not intentionally defining a core class, then this is the most likely explanation of whats going on.p  pHowever, you might actually be trying to define a class in a core namespace, the source of which you may have taken, for example, from a nonAndroid virtual machine project. This will most assuredly not work. At a minimum, it jeopardizes the compatibility of your app with future versions of the platform. It is also often of questionable legality.p  pIf you really intend to build a core library  which is only appropriate as part of creating a full virtual machine distribution, as opposed to compiling an application  then use the corelibrary option to suppress this error message.p  pIf you go ahead and use corelibrary but are in fact building an application, then be forewarned that your application will still fail to build or run, at some point. Please be prepared for angry customers who find, for example, that your application ceases to function once they upgrade their operating system. You will be to blame for this problem.p  pIf you are legitimately using some code that happens to be in a core package, then the easiest safe alternative you have is to repackage that code. That is, move the classes in question into your own package namespace. This means that they will never be in conflict with core system classes. JarJar is a tool that may help you in this endeavor. If you find that you cannot do this, then that is an indication that the path you are on will ultimately lead to pain, suffering, grief, and lamentation.p  p[20111109 174215  RcsCoreSettings] Dx 1 error aborting [20111109 174215  RcsCoreSettings] Conversion to Dalvik format failed with error 1p

Negative 54712 pI would like to expose the methods of a class as functions after decoration in my local scope. For example if I had a class and decoratorp  precodedef somedecoratorf     ...transform f...     return decoratedf  class Cobject     def initself,x         self.x  x     def fself,y         Some doc string         return self.x  y     def gself,y,z         Some other doc string         return self.x  y  z codepre  pand if I didnt care about automizing the process I could add the following code to my module the followingp  precodesomedecorator def fCinstance,x     Some doc string.     return Cinstance.fx  somedecorator def gCinstance,x,y     Some other doc string.     return Cinstance.gx,y     codepre  pto the effect that the following evaluate to Truep  precodec  C0 fc,1  c.f1 codepre  pBut I would like to be able to do this automatically. Something likep  precodemyfuns  exposemethodsMyClass for funname, fun in myfuns.iteritems     locals[funname]  somedecoratorfun  foo  MyClassdata somefunctionalityfoo,args  foo.somefunctionalityargs codepre  pwould do the trick although it feels a little wrong declaring local variables this way. How can I do this in a way so that all the relevant attributes of the method correctly transform into the function versions I would appreciate any suggestions.p  pP.S.p  pI am aware that I can decorate methods of class instances, but this is not really what I am after. It is more about 1 a preference for the function version syntax 2 the fact that my decorators make functions map over collections of objects in fancy and optimized ways. Getting behavior 2 by decorating methods would require my collections classes to inherit attributes from the objects they contain, which is orthogonal to the collection semantics.p

Negative 54712 pI am looking to create a layout for my site where a sidebar is fixed at the right side of the viewport with a 30 width content is to the left of it until the browser window reaches a certain width, at which point I want the content and sidebar to be centred and no longer grow with the browser window since it becomes hard to read at extremely large widths. Here is an idea of the html being usedp  precodeltbodygt ltdiv idsidebargtsidebar contentltdivgt ltdiv idcontentgtarticles, images, etcltdivgt codepre  pAnd here is some of the basic HTML being used to format itp  pre classlangcss prettyprintoverridecodesidebar      width 30     position fixed     right 0     top 0     backgroundcolor gray  content      width 70     marginright 30     maxwidth 49em  codepre  pAt this point, when the content gets wider than 49em, it sticks to the right side of the page creating an everincreasing gap between it and the fixed sidebar. What I would like is to have it reach a max width of 49em, have the sidebar reach 21em so they are still 7030 and remain fixed, but have that whole 70em worth of width centered in the viewport. p  pI also want the background colour of the sidebar to span the entire way from the edge of the content to the righthand side of the screen i.e. a containing div that centers both the sidebar and content with a max width of 70em doesnt work since the background of the sidebar would only go to the edge of the containing div instead of the viewport. That one isnt as important because it might look fine to put some sort of textured background on the body element to make it look like as though the page is sitting on some textured surface not ideal, but fine. I just havent been able to center the sidebar and content while maintaining the sidebars fixed positioning.p  pThanksp  pUpdate heres a very rough schematic of what I am looking forp  pABCDp  pB is the content area with a max width of 49em. C is the sidebar with max width of 21em AND it has to have fixed positioning. A and D would be the margins each half of the difference between the viewport width and 70em. Background of D must be the same colour gray as the sidebar. Background of A must be white.p

Negative 54712 pOn the Javascript side of things I registered an event listener to a text codeltinputgtcode for the codeonkeyupcode event.p  pEach time the event is triggered, a function is invoked that creates an codexmlhttprequestcode object that passes the inputs codevaluecode as an url encoded codePOSTcode variable to the request.p  pThe request page is an codeaspxcode script which accepts the post variable, does some processing on it, and adds the processed input as a parameter to a MS SQL query.  The result set produced from executing the query is placed into a codedatasetcode which is converted to XML and then transformed via an XSLT into XHTML that is then inserted into the page that made the ajax call via the codeinnerHTMLcode injection method.p  pIf youve followed me so far, the result is a fulltext search on an MS SQL DB that produces results for each key release.  It is also worth mentioning that I am using MS SQL 2005 and IIS6.0.p  pThe system seems to work great, except for one testcase.  That is when someone just pounds input as fast as they possibly can the server eventually returns code501 internal server errorscode for each request.  After a few minutes, it seems to fix itself and operate normally again.  I was unable to gleam any useful information from IIS about these internal errors.p  pNow this is mere speculation, but my first assumptions were that either there were too many open simultaneous requests that had not yet finished, or that there were too many requests being made in a short period.p  pMy initial thought was to create a emqueueem of these codexmlhttprequestscode and only open one at a time.p  pHowever, rather than the queue I tried thisp  pEach codeonkeyupcodep  ol liCall codeabortcode on the last codexmlhttprequestcode that was generated by codeonkeyupcodeli liCreate a new codexmlhttprequestcode for this codeonkeyupcodeli ol  pThis procedure appears to eliminate the problem.p  pWhat I was unable to do was determine the root cause of this issue is it a server limitation or is it a browser limitation  Is there some other way to solve this problem without needing this abort procedurep  pI can post code if necessary, but the code is very lengthy and many technologies are at use in this project so Im not sure if it would really help anyone answer this question. p

Negative 54712 pI have read in a number of places that using reflection to set internal fields during TDD is bad as it probably implies that we have not yet sorted our interface for the Class under test. However I would like to present a scenario which i think is perfectly plausible and I cannot think of any clean solution to the problem at hand except Reflection. p  pHere is an example class with a corresponding testp  precodepublic Class Movie     public string MovieNameget private set     public void AddExternalReviewIMovieReview review          Logic that needs Unit testing.       if  review.MovieName.EqualsMovieName                  Do stuff..             codepre  pUnitTestp  precode[Test] public Class MovieTests     public void CanAddExternalReview           MovieReviewStub movieReviewStub  new MovieReviewStub        movieReviewStub.MovieName  The Godfather        Movie m  new Movie       Need to Set object m statei.e set Property MovieName to The Godfather       Only way to do that seems to be relection.        m.AddExternalReviewmovieReviewStub       Assert on some condition.      codepre  pIt is quite common to have properties that cannot be set by a Classs normal Clients. However the UnitTest Class may need access to such PropertiesFields so that it can set the relevant state necessary for the Test. As far as I can see reflection is the only way out.  This must be quite a common requirement, yet most articlesdiscussions on the web seem to frown upon the use of reflection in TDD. Any ideasinsights would be most welcome.  p

Negative 54712 pWe have put together a very comprehensive database of retailers across the country with specific criteria.  It took over a year of phone interviews, etc., to put together the list.  The list is, of course, not openly available on our site to download as a flat file...that would be silly.  p  pBut all the content is searchable on the site via Google Maps.  So theoretically with enough zipcode searches, someone could eventually grab all the retailer data.  Of course, we dont want that since our whole model is to do the research and interviews required to compile this database and offer it to  endusers for consumption on our site.p  pSo weve come to the conclusion there isnt really any way to protect the data from being taken enmasse but a potentially competing website.  But is there a way to watermark the data  Since the LatLon is precalculated in our db, we dont need the address to be 100 correct.  Were thinking of, say, replacing 1776 3rd St with 1776 Third Street or replacing standard characters with unicode replacements.  This way, if we found this data exactly on a competing site, wed know it was plagiarism.  The downside is if users tried to cutandpaste the modified addresses into their own instance of Google Maps  in some cases the modification would make it difficult.p  pHow have other websites with valuable openlydistributed content tackled this challenge  Any suggestionsp  pThanksp

Negative 54712 pIve been trying to figure out how to access the results of the nginx upload module from embedded perl using nginxperl or lua using the embedded lua module. Ive only been able to find examples of how to use the module with fastcgi or similar, something I would, if possible, like to avoid having to use.p  pSimply letting the uploadpass have a luaperl content handler does not seem to work with the body being somehow truncated to just the first line yes, Ive told it to wait for the body and made sure its not written to a file.p  pAt least when using Perl I havent tried Lua, but Im suspecting the same thing will happen, the complete body as raw multipartformdata can be made available if one does a proxypass to another nginx instance.p  pMy question is threefold. Firstly is this expected behaviourhow are arguments passed from the upload module Secondly, is it possible to access the results of the upload module without reparsing the multipartformdata using a perllua library in the content handler. p  pFinally, if the latter is not possible, can I use multipartformdata parser used by nginxupload without manually exporting the functions and using some form of FFI.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 54712 pAlright, I have to deploy an ASP.NET application with a Silverlight component to multiple staging environments. The app depends on a Wcf service that is part of a different project but should always be hosted on the same server as my project albeit on a different port. I do not want to have to remember to modify the address of the services endpoint in the ServiceReferences.ClientConfig file every time I deploy to a new environment. Since there is no way to specify multiple ServiceReferences.ClientConfigs for a project like you can with Web.Configs, I followed the advice a hrefhttptimheuer.comblogarchive20100405managingservicereferencesinsilverlightapplicationsfordifferentenvironments.aspx relnofollowherea to create a reference for each environment in my ServiceReferences.ClientConfig. I then specify the name of the desired endpoint as a setting in the Web.config of my main project and pass it as an initial parameter to the Silverlight component. This is where I hit a wall. I use slsvcutil to generate an asynchronous client for my web service. As far as I can see, the only way to pass the desired endpoint address to my service client is through its constructor. Here is an example of the typical service callp  pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecodeyield return new WebServiceResultltServiceClient, MethodCallCompletedEventArgsgt    client gt client.MethodNameAsyncparam1, param2, ...,   result gt  ....   codepre  pHere is an abbreviated definition of the class WebServiceResult.p  pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecodepublic class WebServiceResultltT, Kgt  IResult   where T  new   where K  EventArgs     private readonly ActionltKgt callback    private readonly ExpressionltActionltTgtgt serviceCall    private ActionExecutionContext currentContext     public WebServiceResultExpressionltActionltTgtgt serviceCall, ActionltKgt callback           serviceCall  serviceCall       callback  callback         public void ExecuteActionExecutionContext context            currentContext  context        var lambda  LambdaExpressionserviceCall        var methodCall  MethodCallExpressionlambda.Body        var eventName  methodCall.Method.Name.ReplaceAsync, Completed        var eventInfo  typeofT.GetEventeventName        var service  new T        eventInfo.AddEventHandlerservice, new EventHandlerltKgtOnEvent        serviceCall.Compileservice         public void OnEventobject sender, K args            if callback  null callbackargs       codepre  pSince the generic T is constrained to be something with a parameterless constructor, how should I specify the name of the desired endpointAddressp

Negative 54712 pI have a question on usage of curl command. So basically we are trying to consume couple of  third party services have which supports ssl. We have two different vendorsp  ol lipOne vendor has configured their service with ssl which needs a client authentication. For which we had two keys one is private key with public key of ours .we gave our public key to them and we got their public key with certificate.we had a unix client with curl for that we generated the .pem file with the following command cat server.crt serverpublickey.key  server.pem and used curl command to call thier service.It worked fine.In this vendor case we never used to get the wsdl from browser. It used to show it needs a client authentication.pli lipWe have another vendor which services are configured with ssl but they did not configure with client authentication.So we were able to hit the wsdl link the browser which used to asked us to accept their certificate and we accepted the certificate in the browser and we were able to see the wsdl file. Technically when we hit any site with https they send the public certificate and public key .so browser encrypts the data with the key and send back to the server and when we get the data from the server the browser decryption happens with the public key. Now the question is how to call this services from curl  I guess the previous vendor for every request we send our public key so that they will know it is coming from our side. In the other vendor case they have an authentication service .once we authenticated successfully they are sending us a session id which we need to use for the respective calls. This is the reason why i guess they never had a client authentication configuration with their ssl. Again this is my guess... pli ol  pNow my question is for the second vendor we have only the certificate which we got it in the browser. Can some one tell how to call the curl command with the certificate and make call to the third party service p  pI might be wrong in some concepts.Any answers to my understanding is also appreciablep

Negative 54712 pstrongtldr versionstrong p  pI get errors when using OLE DB SNC10.0 connection managers after a few nights of running, could connections not be properly timing out  Switching to ADO.NET Connection Managers and sources seems to fix it, whyp  pI apologize for the generic title but there are too many details to state in a single line.p  pstrongTechnologystrongp  pIn all cases the database server, both source and destination are SQL Server 2008 R2p  pstrongThe setupstrongp  pI have a set of SSIS packages that run one after another in the middle of the night.  There are 7 of them currently.  They all perform a similar set of tasks they first connect to a source database and copy the data to a staging database.  Then they do various transformations within the staging database.  Finally the process connects to a target database and fills it with data.   p  pI set up all the connections as OLE DB connections SQL Native Client 10.0 so that I can use them with Lookup components and other OLEspecific components.   p  pstrongThe problemstrongp  pWe have been experiencing issues repeatedly with our automated runs of the SSIS package.  Generally I will test it running manually from my station, it will run fine then well save the SSIS package into the SQL Server and schedule it and it will run fine.  A few nights later, we will get an issue such as  p  blockquote   pSSIS Error Code DTSEOLEDBERROR.  An OLE DB error has occurred. Error code 0x80004005.   An OLE DB record is available.  Source Microsoft OLE DB Provider for SQL Server  Hresult 0x80004005  Description Protocol error in TDS stream.p blockquote  porp  blockquote   pSSIS Error Code DTSEOLEDBERROR.  An OLE DB error has occurred. Error code 0x80004005.   An OLE DB record is available.  Source Microsoft SQL Server Native Client 10.0  Hresult 0x80004005  Description Unknown token received from SQL Server.p blockquote  pWhen searched for online, both of these point toward connection issues and specifically emnetworkem connectivity problems.  p  pstrongWorkaroundstrongp  pI found that a quick, if not always simple, solution to these issues is to replace the source nodes with ADO NET Sources rather than OLE DB Sources.  This is acceptable within my Data Flow tasks for some cases, but in the cases where I need to use a Lookup component, or some other such tool that only works with the OLE sources, this is not a good enough solution if I will still encounter these issues.p  pstrongQuestionstrongp  pI know there are tons of differences between ADO.NET and OLE DB connections, but one primary thing I noticed is that the OLE DB connection manager has two timeouts, both defaulted to the value of 0 which generally means disabled no timeout.  The ADO.NET connection manager has a single timeout and its set to the value of 15 15 seconds.  p  pHow do these two connection managers handle the timeouts and closing connections  With a value of 0 in an OLE DB connection manager timeout, will that connection never be closed unless something is done on the SQL Server  Could this be part of my issue, with so many dataflow tasks opening OLE DB connections and then not being closed  Is there anything I can do in an SSIS package to forcefully close these connectionsp  pstrongemEDITemstrongp  pHere is a screenshot of the data flow task in question.  I have altered some of the names to protect the innocent, etc.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com51BSI.jpg altenter image description herep  pThe task as pictured here will run completely fine and works 100 of the time.  If I change that ADO.NET Source to an OLE DB Source I get the errors mentioned in the post.  I have, in some other cases, went through and eliminated Lookups by expanding the source query.  In this task I have not. p

Negative 54712 pI wanted to ask this questions since our application is really close to bproduction stageb and we do not want to mess any data.p  pIm using bRedisb as the data layer between bNodeb and bDBb, and I am doing operations that involves multiple data insertions to different tables.

The reason why I am going to use multiple clients is because when I tried to the insert the multiple datas to multiple tables it gets mixed up. I am going to try this method, however my concerns are do I have to close each redis client in case of an error Another question is, if using multiple clients does not prevent the data getting mixed, what additional precautions could be appliedp

Negative 54712 pProblem In the code presented I am trying to index 26000 geofences polygons. I have tried many combinations of 1inserting the data and 2indexing the data that some are not presented in the code for brevity. I have imported all the data with prebuilt index importing the data and then making the index and making the index and importing the data partially with waiting for nonstale index. In all cases it eats up all the memory and fails by fail I mean I wait for 30 minutes for completing the indexing process. One interesting observation happened in partial inserts with prebuilt index It always starts to eat up all memory around 1790 entries.p  pEnvironment I have tested this on 2 machines 1 4 GB Ram, Dual Core 2.56 CUP 2 12 GB Ram, i7 CPU. I used Visual Studio 2012 which should not be important targeted .NET 4.0 with RavenDB build 2230. The only external library used here other than RavenDB client libraries was NetTopologySuite NuGet.p  pSide Note and Background I am doing my spatial calculations using 2 inmemory data structures a KDTree and an RTree with static data no insertdeleteupdate. Now a new step added to my project which needs to updateinsert some data twice a day because of that I searched for a replacement to remove the burden of housekeeping of this part and I came up with SQLite RTree module. It is fast enough using some parallel programmingit is a mostly readonly database. So far RavenDB is not much of a choice strategic decisions etc but I liked to play with it and it was disappointing. To be precise I love RavenDB 960 and I really am angry with RavenDB 2230.p  pI have used the inmemory trees and tested SQLite with 3,000,000 polygons again to be precise bounding boxes and failed to use RavenDB for 26,000 polygons.

Negative 54712 pI have seen applications that consume all the available space of browser window without any scroll bars on browser window, but scroll bars for specific divs for instance, jsfiddle, which uses scroll bars for html, css, javascript and results divs but no browser window scroll bars.

Pardon me but as a beginner I have to ask this. Is there a specific term for such layouts.

This is because there are millions of rows and we do not want load of one clients database to disturb the performance of another clients database.p  pThis is not an optimal design becausep  ul liManaging separate connections for each client is not flexible,li liChanges need to be propagated across more than one database, and li liA new database need to be created for each new client.li ul  pstrongQuestionstrongp  pIs it possible to include all this data into one database but have some form of physical isolation between the client data so that it performs similarly to having several databases  p  pThis isolation would NOT be at a table or schema level, but more at a row level.

Negative 54712 pIm sure its something fairly simple, but for the life of me I cannot figure out why my child processes are doing no work, getting waited on, then the last one is pausing like Im not closing the pipes properly.  At any rate, Ill post a bunch of code but this is what its doingp  ol lipThe program parses a txt document and takes all individual words, and sends them along a pipe roundrobin style to a specified number of child processes.  I have a 1 dimensional array that holds the pipe FDs with every even index being a read, and every odd index being a write pipe.pli lipAfter the parsing is finished, the program closes the readwrite pipes prior to forking children to close the pipes with the parent. Then, within a for loop, the specified number of child processes are spawned and the write end of the corresponding pipes are closed off in the child, and the read ends are opened.  fgets MUST be used to take the input from the pipes I know, annoying, but its a requirement.  pli lipAfter the child is done, it gets waited on by the parent process.  There are some comment and debugger lines that Ive tried to get to help me, and from them it seems like the child processes are being forked and entered correctly, the write pipe is closed, the read pipe is opened, but when I do the fgets function, it immediately exits and gets waited on by the parent.  Interestingly, not all children get waited on.  If I want the number of children to be 3, 2 processes are waited on, the 3rd gets hung up.  If I want 10 processes, 5 get waited on, and the 6th gets hung up.pli ol  pSo, I am pretty certain it has something to do with fgets but I cannot figure out why  I have a hunch it may be something to do with newline characters being in the wrong spot when theyre sent along the pipe fgets reads up until newline, right but based on the code written and some additional debugging statement the input into the pipe from the parent process seems to be newline terminated properly. p  pAt any rate, heres the code for both the parser then the bit with creating the children p  pParserp  precodechar buf[PIPEBUF]      int wordCount  char buffer[PIPEBUF] char temp char word[50] FILE inputFile  fopenfileName,  r OPENS file Parsing and distributing words round robin to pipes whilefgetsbuffer, sizeof buffer, inputFile     remove all nonalpha chars in buffer and converts to lowercase     int i     fori  0 i lt strlenbuffer i         ifisalphabuffer[i]  0 0 means it is not a letter             buffer[i]                     else             buffer[i]  tolowerbuffer[i] turn the current word to lower case                   parse words and sends them to the sort processes in a roundrobin fashion     temp  strtokbuffer,   splits along spaces     iftemp  NULL         strcpyword, temp         strcatword, n puts newline at the end          int j  0     whiletemp  NULL         FILE input  fdopenpipefds[j21], w         closepipefds[j2] closing read pipes in parent         fputsword, input puts into write pipe         printffputs done successfully with pipe d with contents sn, pipefds[j21], word         closepipefds[j21] closing write pipe after write is done         temp  strtokNULL,           iftemp  NULL             strcpyword, temp             strcatword, n                  ifj  numChildren  1             j  0                  else             j                need to close all parent writes, and parent reads its done with everything fori  0 i lt numChildren i     closepipefds[i]  codepre  pParent forking and getting piped datap  precodeCollection of children need to be created specified by numChildren int count forcount  0 count lt numChildren count     printfCount dn, count      switchp  fork      case 1         perrorCould not create child         exit1      case 0         printfEntering childn         child case, GET INPUT FROM PARENT TO SORT SEND TO SUPPRESSOR Uses both input and output         count[0]  read, count[1]  write         closepipefds[count21] closing write pipes in child         printfwrite pipe closed in childn         FILE output  fdopenpipefds[count2], r opening the read pipe from the parent write pipe         printfread pipe opened in childn         fgetsbuf, PIPEBUF, output gets data from read pipe         printfchild read pipe contents read fgets with buf contents sn, buf         printfchild read pipe closed dn, getpid         execlpsort, sort, sortStuff,charNULL         closepipefds[count2] closing read pipe after reading is done         count  numChildren         break      default         parent case  p holds pid of child          printfI am the parent, PID dn, getpid         child  waitampstatus         printfWaited on child dn, child          break        codepre  pI apologize in advance for the code, Im not the best C programmer, so things tend to get a little messy.p

Negative 54712 pFor a given table in my system of record RDBMS, I need to implement a functionality to export the records incrementally. For example, if a user runs an export job which returns x number of records, I want to return a snapshot id back to the user. For the next export job, user will pass that snapshot id to me and using that I should be able to export only the records that have either been modified or added since. Ideally I would like my snapshot ids to be reusable. In other words, I do not want my snapshot ids to expire, but this is not a hard requirement.p  pGiven that I have LASTUPDATEDATE Timestamp column in all my tables, whats the best way to solve this problemp  pI am not looking for code, tools or commands. I am just looking for the logic of how I should generate this snapshot id and recognize it in subsequent calls to perform an incremental export of records in a given table.p

My first app is a simple magic 8 ball app, that gives a random answer when the user shakes it. She says after she opens the app, and shakes the app instead of receiving a random answer like I do on my nexus 4, the app simply shutsdown and takes her back to her home screen.p  pHeres the code that I think may be causing it. I added the Finish to shut down the activity after a user hits the homescreen, so it would clear out the randomly generated answer instead of storing it for days. p  precodeOverride public void onPause      super.onPause     mSensorManager.unregisterListenermShakeDetector     finish codepre

Negative 54712 pIm making a news archive. I want the news archive to have several options. At first I want the archive to have the option to only display news posted in a certain year and an option to display only news thats posted in a certain category. These features are both saved in my database at every post so with a small php code I can easily find posts created in e.g 2013.p  pThe problem is is that I want to make buttons in my news archive. Buttons that can make the user decide which feature is enabled or not if you understand what Im saying. I want the users to have the ability to make sure only posts of e.g 2013 appear on their screen but on the same time only posts of e.g sport news appear.  By making two features for the user to enable, I couldnt think of a way linking them to the correct page.p  pIf they click on a specific year they will go to article.phpyear2013 for example. But if you also want to use the other feature category its impossible because you will be send to article.phpcategorysport for example and the posts will no longer be searched on their published year but only on their category. p  pI want to make sure that if one featureoption is already enabled the other will only add ampcategorysport at the end of the URL so the URL becomes article.phpyear2013ampcategorysport which makes sure the user can select multiple features at the same time.p  precode   ltul classarchivegt             ltligt             ltdivgtYearltdivgt             ltulgt             ltligtlta hrefarticle.phpyearallgtEvery yearltagtltligt             ltligtlta hrefarticle.phpyear2013gt2013ltagtltligt             ltligtlta hrefarticle.phpyear2012gt2012ltagtltligt             ltligtlta hrefarticle.phpyear2011gt2011ltagtltligt             ltligtlta hrefarticle.phpyear2010gt2010ltagtltligt      ltulgt         ltligt           ltulgt     ltul classarchivegt             ltligt             ltdivgtCategoryltdivgt             ltulgt             ltligtlta hrefcategoryallgtGeneral newsltagtltligt             ltligtlta hrefarticle.phpcategorysportgtSport newsltagtltligt             ltligtlta hrefarticle.phpcategoryinternationalgtInternational newsltagtltligt             ltligtlta hrefarticle.phpcategorynationalgtNational newsltagtltligt          ltulgt         ltligt           ltulgt codepre  pI hope you understand my problem and look forward to hear from some of youp

Negative 54712 pIm currently in the process of prototyping a few small apps, intended for release on Mac and Windows.  Naturally this means Cocoa with ObjectiveC on the Mac and .NET with C on Windows.  Unfortunately, since these two languages are quite different, working on 4 apps is more like working on 8 since I have to do everything twice.  p  pTo some degree this is unavoidable, but Im exploring ways to share some of the common codefunctions that deal with platform independent stuff calculations, formulas, etc..  p  pI considered CC, but since it needs to be compiled into a DLL for use in C it doesnt seem worth it. p  pNow Im looking at using a scripting language like Lua, which is showing some promise, but its not without its share of complications as well.

Negative 54712 pFor my Symfony application I build a deployment script with ANT.

Negative 54712 pI have a button in an MVVM application that is hooked up to a command in the view model. The handler for the view model command does some file IO particularly calling File.Copy to create or overwrite an existing file.p  pNow, it seems that when I doubleclick on the button, this command handler gets called twice. Since both handlers are now trying to access the same file to copyoverwrite it at the same time, Im getting an IOException.p  pIs there anyway to deal with this situation short of catching the IOException and ignoring it This does not seem to be a guaranteed catch although there may be unrelated problems with the rest of the system that causes that to happen.p

Negative 54712 pthis is a code from a chat bot, and its purpose is to save into a file all information about an user.

Negative 54712 pIm learning D3 and my toy application is a visualizer for a 2dimensional gravity simulation using a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiLeapfrogintegration relnofollowSymplectic Velocity Verlet Integrationa.p  pI have had quite some success animating and drawing a path using bound structured data, but it seems to me that D3 isnt really designed for attaching data to more than one element. It sort of assumes that for any given data that there is a clear and simple SVG element that should own it, and this is evident in the direct storage of data within the codedatacode property inside the DOM. p  pIts not clear, though, the proper way to represent a datum with more than one SVG element. For instance, Id really prefer to draw a path emandem a circle for each planet, the path traces its past position and can have a bunch of clever linelength and color interpolation applied, and the circle plots its current position. p  pI can even come up with a few more elements I might want to draw A vectorarrow for velocity... A vectorarrow for acceleration...p  pIn my case, my master data structure is constructed like this, and is dynamically maintained in this structure p  precodevar data  [] function makeParticlex, y, vx, vy             state vector plus goodies                      return [                                        x, y,                                       vx, vy,                                     0, 0,                                       []  path                              ]                                                                                 data.pushmakeParticle400, 100, 0.5, 1 data.pushmakeParticle300, 100, 0.5, 2  and so on codepre  pEach element of data is a planet, which contains its current state vector position, velocity, and cached acceleration needed for the integrator as well as its path history which is an array of positions which is kept truncated to some reasonably large length.p  pCurrently I am updating the path history like this p  precodevar paths  d3.selectsvg.selectAllpath.datadata paths.enter.appendpath  put cool transitions here paths.exit.remove                                      paths.attrstroke, red                                .attrd, functiond                                        return lineDrawerd[6]                                                                                        codepre  pThis works fine, each path tracks its own copy of its own planets path.p  pIts not immediately clear to me how to extend this elegantly to include my circle at the head of each path. I certainly do not want to duplicate the entire datum into the circles DOM element as the path data is simply not necessary for it.p  pstrongEditstrong in light of my selfanswer p  pI am hoping that someone can help to elucidate a way to use groups to make datadriven the set of things to draw for each datum. e.g. code[position, velocity, force, path]code as data where they are visualized using, respectively, a circle, an arrow closed path, an arrow closed path, and an open path. It is also possible that this is completely overthinking it because these properties are sort of fixed.p

Negative 54712 pI was recently discussing enums vs public static final constants with a friend. I told him that public static final constants are more maintainable than enums, sometimes faster android developer docs confirm this, and more convenient as well. I also said that you lose functionality when using enums as wellp  ol liYou cannot extend an enum.li liYou cannot instantiate an enum.li ol  pHe then said you shouldnt be using an enum if you need to instantiate or extend an enum. I then replied thats why we should just use constants because it is more maintainable What if mid project we need to instantiate an enum or extend it Then we would have to change everything. p  pAn example demonstrating enums vs constants I made to illustrate my pointp  precodepublic enum WeekDay     We will start at 1 for demonstration   SUNDAYSunday, 1, MONDAYMonday, 2, TUESDAYTuesday, 3, WEDNESDAY         Wednesday, 4, THURSDAYThursday, 5, FRIDAYFriday, 6, SATURDAY         Saturday, 7    Notice we cannot do this...This is where enums fail.

These methods can also be replicated if needed in public static final constant classes. Aside from the switch I dont see any enum advantages.p  pIn conclusion, is an enum really better than public static final constants If so, where did I go wrong Is their something I am missingp  pEDIT You cannot use generics in enums as well.p

Negative 54712 pa hrefhttpwww.runescape.comRunescapea is a large online game with a pureJava client which runs in the browser as a signed applet. It is pretty unique in that regard, with the other major example I know being a hrefhttpwww.puzzlepirates.comYohoho Puzzle Piratesa. Due in part to the forces in the game economy, there is a large population of automated players running various bot software to grind for ingame resources.p  pThese bots are some of the most complex Java applications I have seen, especially with regard to modifying the JVM state at runtime. Im curious how these work, not necessarily specific to a particular game but more generally. You can Google for examples pretty easily. Im not going to direct link any because some of them are allegedly associated with malware.p  pFrom what I can figure out, this is the approximate flow of what the bot doesp  ol liLaunches and attaches to the game applet. Im not sure if this is a result of launching the applet in the bots current JVM or a result of attaching to the games JVM after it launches.li liReads the game state. This at least means getting a reference to the current Applet and reading off of its Graphics. Im not sure what else is involved here. I know some bots get references to some of the games own objects and call their getters to read internal state programmatically.li liFakes input. As far as the game can tell, its receiving regular mouse and keyboard events. However, these are faked at the AWT level, since these bots can run fine when not in the foreground, and they do not use the system cursor.li ol  pHow are each of these steps performed What would I do if I wanted to write a similar bot for a similar game Specificallyp  ol liShould the bot launch the game, or attach to the game after it launches Which of these approaches is feasiblereasonable How are they done In each case, how feasiblereasonable is it to get references to the games Applet What about JFrames or other AWTSwing components it containsli liGiven a reference to the games various AWTSwing components, how does the bot go about reading them Whenwhere is it safe to do thisli liHow does the bot call into the game code to call getters for client state Note that the game code is obfuscated, and the names likely change with every build even if the overall topology of the code is almost the same. How does the author find these methods of interest to begin withli liHow does the bot send fake AWT input events How does it do so in a reasonable and consistent mannerli ol  pIm not necessarily looking to write such a bot, although this is one of the more interesting pieces of software Ive seen lately, so Im definitely looking to learn more about it. Interestingly enough, I think a lot of the stuff here could be applied to nonadversarial situations such as automated UI testing.p  pThank you all for your time and your helpp
Negative 54712 pI need to compute using ssjs the options inside the combobox which is withing an editable column inside the Dojo data grid. The combobox values need be computed based on a column value in the same row. For e.g if column B has the value 1 the the selection in column E should display the options 5,10,15 and if the value in column B is 2 the options should be 10,20,30. Update Below is my code until now, I need to populate the values in the columns labeled Relative Ranking  SC Level 1, Relative Ranking  SC Level 2 and Relative Ranking  SC Level 3 based on the values in the column Grade Cluster. Based on the Grade Cluster for a particular row I need to get the count of how many documents have the particular Grade Cluster and accordingly populate relative ranks. For e.g if there are 10 rows having the Grade Cluster G1 then I need to populate the values 110 to 1010 in the Relative Ranking columns in each of the rows having the Grade Cluster as G1.p  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingUTF8gtltxpview xmlnsxphttpwww.ibm.comxspcore xmlnsxehttpwww.ibm.comxspcoreex dojoThemetrue dojoParseOnLoadtruegt ltxpthis.resourcesgt     ltxpdojoModule namedojox.grid.cells.dijitgtltxpdojoModulegt     ltxpstyleSheet hrefDojoGridStyle.cssgtltxpstyleSheetgt ltxpthis.resourcesgt ltxpthis.beforePageLoadgtlt[CDATA[javascriptvar key  sessionScope.key     var curDBNotesDatabase  session.getCurrentDatabase     var vwlkApprViewNotesView     var collDocApprNotesDocumentCollection     vwlkApprView  curDB.getViewvwlkApprSCID     collDocAppr  vwlkApprView.getAllDocumentsByKeykey      viewScope.scApprDocCount  collDocAppr.getCount]]gtltxpthis.beforePageLoadgt  ltxppanel idpnlScreening styleheightautowidth100.0gt     ltxerestService idSCViewDatagt          ltxethis.servicegt             ltxeviewItemFileService viewNamevwlkApprSCID                 defaultColumnstrue keys  javascriptsessionScope.key                 keysExactMatchtrue varapprDocgt                 ltxethis.columnsgt                     ltxerestViewColumn namerrValuesgt                         ltxethis.valuegtlt[CDATA[ javascriptvar apprRow  requestScope.getapprDocprintapprRow]]gtltxethis.valuegt                     ltxerestViewColumngt                 ltxethis.columnsgt             ltxeviewItemFileServicegt         ltxethis.servicegt     ltxerestServicegt     ltxedjxDataGrid iddjxDataGrid1 selectionModesingle         rowsPerPage90 autoHeight100 singleClickEdittrue         storeComponentIdSCViewData jsIdapprSCGirdgt         ltxedjxDataGridColumn iddjxDataGridColumn1             fieldAppraiseeEmpID labelE.No width2gt         ltxedjxDataGridColumngt         ltxedjxDataGridColumn iddjxDataGridColumn2             fieldAppraiseeName labelE.Name width6gt         ltxedjxDataGridColumngt         ltxedjxDataGridColumn iddjxDataGridColumn3             fieldAppraiseeGrade labelGrade width2gt         ltxedjxDataGridColumngt         ltxedjxDataGridColumn iddjxDataGridColumn4             fieldAppraiseeCWLCluster labelGrade Cluster width2gt         ltxedjxDataGridColumngt         ltxedjxDataGridColumn iddjxDataGridColumn5             fieldAppeTotImpRate labelAppraisee Impacted Rating width5gt         ltxedjxDataGridColumngt         ltxedjxDataGridColumn iddjxDataGridColumn6             fieldApprTotImpRate labelAppraiser Impacted Rating width5gt         ltxedjxDataGridColumngt         ltxedjxDataGridColumn iddjxDataGridColumn7             fieldRevTotImpRate labelReviewer Impacted Rating width5gt         ltxedjxDataGridColumngt         ltxedjxDataGridColumn iddjxDataGridColumn8             fieldApperFinalGrade labelAppraiser Final Grades width5gt         ltxedjxDataGridColumngt         ltxedjxDataGridColumn iddjxDataGridColumn17             fieldApperRelativeRank labelAppraiser Relative Ranks width5gt         ltxedjxDataGridColumngt         ltxedjxDataGridColumn iddjxDataGridColumn9             fieldRevFinalGrade labelReviewer Final Grades width5gt         ltxedjxDataGridColumngt         ltxedjxDataGridColumn iddjxDataGridColumn10             fieldRevRelativeRank labelReviewer Relative Ranks width5gt         ltxedjxDataGridColumngt         ltxedjxDataGridColumn iddjxDataGridColumn11             fieldSCFinalGradeL1 labelFinal Grading  SC Level 1 width5             editabletrue cellTypedojox.grid.cells.Selectgt             ltxethis.optionsgtlt[CDATA[javascriptvar states  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]return states]]gtltxethis.optionsgtltxedjxDataGridColumngt         ltxedjxDataGridColumn iddjxDataGridColumn12 fieldSCRelativeRankL1 labelRelative Ranking  SC Level 1               width5 editabletrue cellTypedojox.grid.cells.Selectgt      ltxedjxDataGridColumngt ltxedjxDataGridColumn iddjxDataGridColumn13          fieldSCFinalGradeL2 labelFinal Grading  SC Level 2 width5gtltxedjxDataGridColumngt         ltxedjxDataGridColumn iddjxDataGridColumn14             fieldSCRelativeRankL2 labelRelative Ranking  SC Level 2             width5gt         ltxedjxDataGridColumngt         ltxedjxDataGridColumn iddjxDataGridColumn15             fieldSCFinalGradeL3 labelFinal Grading  SC Level 3 width5gt         ltxedjxDataGridColumngt         ltxedjxDataGridColumn iddjxDataGridColumn16             fieldSCRelativeRankL3 labelRelative Ranking  SC Level 3             width5gt         ltxedjxDataGridColumngt         ltxedjxDataGridColumn iddjxDataGridColumn18             fieldAppraiserName labelAppraiser Name width6gt         ltxedjxDataGridColumngt         ltxedjxDataGridColumn iddjxDataGridColumn19             fieldReviewerName labelReviewer Name width6gt         ltxedjxDataGridColumngt         ltxpeventHandler eventonRowClick submittrue             refreshModepartial refreshIdpnlScreeninggt         ltxpeventHandlergt     ltxedjxDataGridgt ltxppanelgtltxpviewgt codepre

However, I need to add HTML capability to emails, so that I have configured FOSUserBundle to use TwigSwiftmailer instead, so, I changed the config file to the followingp  precodefosuser     dbdriver orm  other valid values are mongodb, couchdb     fromemail         address infoivexsolutions.com             sendername iVex Solutions     firewallname main     service         mailer fosuser.mailer.twigswift         resetting         tokenttl 43200     12 horas         email             template   DesytecGestionBundleResettingemail.txt.twig     userclass DesytecGestionBundleEntityUsuario codepre  pAfter I changed that, mails are not being received by recipients. The most frustrating thing, is that the Send method call returns that it has correctly sent the email. Nothing is stored in log...

The expression used something like . or . and the rest of my expressions. Unfortunately, I neglected to copy it down and the answer has been deleted. After that I have tried tweaking it quite a bit but nothing has worked. Any extra help is appreciated. p

Negative 54712 pI have a MATLAB script which does complex transforms and calculations in very large 3D matrices e.g. 50,000 x 300 x 100. I cannot do anything else on the computer while the script is running because the script is very memoryintensive, which is fine but why does the computer remain slow after the script has finished running and the variables are no longer in the workspace I assume this must be something to do with the way memory is allocated in the MATLAB scriptp  p[I am running Mac OSX 10.7 and MATLAB 7.13]p

Negative 54712 pI have an Entity Framework DbContext with two different DbSets.p  pIn my view I am combining these two sets into the same view model and listing them in the same table.p  pI want to support table paging to be able to query only a page of records at a time sorted by a particular column.

I could simply take the page size from both tables and then sort in memory but the problem comes into play when I am skipping records.

Negative 54712 pI am using Marathon Java desktop application testing tool to automate regression testing. Marathon uses Jython so I can use Java libraries and Python libraries. As my script goes through filling out certain fields, various fields appear or dont appear based on values that I entered in previous fields. I need to skip over the fields that arent there for the obvious reason. When fields are disabled, but still there, this is fine because I can usep  precode    if Component.isEnabled         do something     else         do something codepre  pThe problem is when the component doesnt exist. Is there any way, in Java, to test for the existence of a component For example, codeComponent.existscode would suit my needs, but there isnt such a method in the component class.p  pI would prefer to solve my problem by using an codeif Component.existscode statement, but I am able to get around it using a try, except block. However, this leads to major execution time issues for the script. It tries to find the component for 2 or 3 minutes before it throws an exception. The only way I could see around this issue is if there was some sort of statement like codetry for x secondscode and move on if component is not found. Is there any way to limit the amount of time you try any given statementp

Negative 54712 pI need some memory management and was hoping I could base it on some codestdcode container. My requirements arep  ol lielements have only a default constructor no copy, no move, nothing elseli liThe container can be expanded at the back by a small contiguous block of elementsli liI even know roughly how many elements I will need in total, even better, at any time how many I will need eventually. These are estimates, though.li liI dont really need an iterator, but a way to obtain the running number of an element would be handy.li ol  pSo, I would need something that can be expanded by adding chunks, like codestddequecode. But with codestddequecode, I cannot guarantee that expansion by, say, 8 elements, gives me a contiguous block. And codestddequecode doesnt have codecapacitycode so I cannot adapt from a codestddequecode.p  pThis would mean that I have to write my own, correct emnote I dont want to know how to write my own, but only if I have toem.p  pstrongEditstrong to clarify only the blocks of elements obtained at each expansion has to be contiguous, but not the whole container  that would obviously contradict with the other requirements.p  pstrongEdit for jalfstrong So what is this for a spatial octtree for sorting 3D points. The tree nodes refer to cubic cells and form a linked structure with parents and daughters linked using pointers. Sibling nodes are not linked, but are adjacent in memory. The total number of nodes is not known in advance because the number of points per final node 1, but an estimate can be obtained. During tree building, when dividing a nonfinal node, a contiguous chunk of up to 8 new nodes must be obtained and will then be linked into the tree. Moving or copying those nodes would invalidated any existing links pointers to them.p  pstrongAnother Editstrong Just to clarify some discussions. Any design that is based on codestdvectorltTgtcode must not use coderesizecode andor codereservecode. Both would require copy or move constructor of codeTcode under certain conditions. Even if never called under these conditions, the code wont compile.p

Negative 54712 pI have a simple asp.net mvc 5 site with its own authentication system. Users can sign in either using my sites account or from external such as facebook or google, etc... I want to add a commenting system to allow users feedback on the sites content. p  pI have tried using Disqus by embedding its universal code script snippet and things seem to work fine. However, the problem is that Disqus requires users to log in again via its own authentication. If users have signed in to my site, I dont want users to do that again just to leave comments. After some searching around I concluded that Disqus was not really what I need and decided not to use it.p  pNow I am trying to determine whether theres a commenting system thatd be easy to integrate to my site or if I should just implement my own. I dont care too much about nested comments, if its supported then better but otherwise no big deal. p
Negative 54712 pI have created a hidden field in my JavaScript and this hidden filed is used to capture the  value that users select from the message box.

Negative 54712 pI created a logging library codeliblog.socode.

Here i created a daemon codelogdcode which putsactually should codefile pointercode codertfilecode. p  pThats what i want to do.  Here codeliblog.socode is a dynamic libarary, codelogdcode starts on boot up and it should set file pointer to codertfilecode and codelogrtclientcode should get the file pointer and print some logs.p  pProblem comes to share the common variable codertfilecode.  I tried other suggestions suggested in p  pstackoverflow a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1433204howdoishareavariablebetweensourcefilesincwithexternbuthow[1]a first solution was to use codeexterncode and complete the task. For my situation i though for a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10355339howtoshareavariableanditsvaluebetweenmanysourcefileinclanguage[2]a this. Rather than making a global variable put the variable to scoped file and use codegetcode and codesetcode functions to access the values. p  pbut both options didnt worked for me let me Explain. p  ol liI Have tocompiled all the files codeliblog.socode codelogdcode and codelogrtclientcode separately so, it was showing error when codelogrtclientcode had declaration of codertfilecode but not defined because its defined in codelogdcode. which was notcant compiled with codelogrtclientcode. Though all the files linked to codeliblog.socodeli liWhen i tried second options, results were unexpected, codelogdcode calls to codeliblog.socode sets and gets the file pointer but when i ran codelogrtclientcode codertfilecode doesnt had the expected pointerFile pointer. Means allocation for codertfilecode for both are differen. li ol  pCan any one suggest me a solution. Hope this explains everything. p

Negative 54712 pI am using the Intel Xeon Phi coprocessor, which has up to 240 threads, and I am working on minimizing the number of threads used for a particular application or maximize performance while being within a percentage of the best execution time. So for example if I have the following measurementsp  ul liThreads  Execution time li li240       100 s li li200       105 s li li150       107 s  li li120       109 s li li100       120 sli ul  pI would like to select a number of threads between 120 and 150, since the performance curve there seems to stabilize and the reduction in execution time is not that significant in this case around 15 of the best measured time. I did this using an exhaustive search algorithm measuring from 1 to 240 threads, but my problem is that it takes too long for smaller number of threads obviously depending on the size of the problem. p  pTo try to reduce the number of measurements, I developed a sort of binary search algorithm. Basically I have an upper and lower limit beginning at 0 and 240 threads, I take the value in the middle and measure it and at 240. I get the percent difference between both values and if it is within 15 this value was selected after analyzing the results for the exhaustive search I assign a new lower or upper bound. If the difference is larger than 15 then this is a new lower bound 120240 and if it is smaller then it is a new upper bound 0120, and if I get a better execution time I store it as the best execution time. p  pThe problem with this algorithm is that first of all this is not necessarily a sorted array of execution times, and for some problem sizes the exhaustive search results show two different minimum, so for example in one I get the best performance at 80 threads and at 170, and I would like to be able to return 80, and not 170 threads as a result of the search. However, for the other cases where there is only one minimum, the algorithm found a value very close to the one expected.p  pIf anyone has a better idea or knows of an existing search algorithm or heuristic that could help me I would be really grateful.p

Its really frustrating.p  pSo basically, I could use help figuring out how to do the watermarks on the two larger sizes, and then also I just want to know if the code below is as efficient as it could be. It seems a bit slow when creating the 4 sizes on my local machine.p  precodevar fileName  req.files.photo.name,     fileBaseName  fileName.substr0, fileName.lastIndexOf.,     uploadRoot

Negative 54712 pThe problem is simple I want to move and later, be able to rotate an image. For example, every time i press the right arrow on my keyboard, i want the image to move 0.12 pixels to the right, and every time i press the left arrow key, i want the image to move 0.12 pixels to the left.p  pNow, I have multiple solutions for this 1 simply add the incremental value, i.e.p  precodeimage.x  0.12 codepre  pthis is of course assuming that were going to the right.p  p2 i multiplicate the value of a single increment by the times i already went into this particular direction  1, like thisp  precodevar resultNumber  0.12  numberOfTimesWentRight1 image.x  result codepre  pBoth of these approaches work but produce similiar, yet subtly different, results. If we add some kind of button component that simply resets the x and y coordinates of the image, you will see that with the first approach the numbers dont add up correctly. it goes from .12, .24, .359999, .475 etc.p  pBut with the second approach it works well. Its pretty obvious as to why though, it seems like  operations with Numbers are not really precise.p  pWhy not use the second approach then Well, i want to rotate the image as well. This will work for the first attempt, but after that the image will jump around. Why In the second approach we never took the original position of the image in account. So if the originpoint shifts a bit down or up because you rotated your image, and THEN you try to move the image again it will move to the same position as if you hadnt rotated before.p  pAlright, to make this short How can i reliably move, scale and rotate images for 110 of a pixelp

Also I return string which represents the whole control content from the method getaccValue.p  pI tested my implementation using application Inspet.exe from Windows Kits. I see acc role, name value which I provides in the IAccessible methods.p  pstrongTHE PROBLEM ISstrong Screenreaders do not read the whole content of the control. Screenreaders read the only text entered to the control, but not the content of the inserted objects.p  pI suggest that Screenreaders do not use IAccessible interface for RichEdit control.p  pstrongMy question to the comunitystrong does anybody have experince with Accessibility support for the RichEdit control with inserted OLE objects.

This currency is earned or purchased. p  pCurrency is given to players periodically.p  pCurrency can be purchased in lots 1,5,10,20,50,100 or atleast that is what I wanted.p  pGoogle Play v3 forces you to store ownership details of consumable items on their servers.p  pYou can not purchase the same item over until it is consumed first, removed from ownership according to google, and therefore not possessed in your game any more.p  pThis presents some really painful problems to resolve... if I am understanding this correctly.p  pDo you make a ton of duplicate store items to handle the players ability to make multiple purchases of the same item should he want to restock Can you make free items that are tracked p  pWhat if the player buys a 100 pack, uses 99. Then uninstalls and moves to another device Hell get all 100 back.

Negative 54712 pHello I am designing an app which needs to send CSSHTML mail to various clients. What i have done so far is complete the app and send all the data to be stored in Parse Cloud as parse objects.

I have Googled about this but couldnt find much documentation related to this topic. Or should i use some Mandrill API in some other languages such as Python Thanks in advance.p

Negative 54712 pThe a hrefhttpdocs.jboss.orghibernateorm4.3manualenUShtmlch11.htmlobjectstatemakingpersistent relnofollowhibernate documenta saysp  h2persisth2  blockquote   ppersist makes a transient instance persistent. However, it does not guarantee that the identifier value will be assigned to the   persistent instance immediately, the assignment might happen at flush   time. persist also guarantees that it will not execute an INSERT   statement if it is called outside of transaction boundaries. This is   useful in longrunning conversations with an extended   Sessionpersistence context.p blockquote  h2saveh2  blockquote   psave does guarantee to return an identifier. If an INSERT has to be executed to get the identifier  e.g. identity generator, not   sequence, this INSERT happens immediately, no matter if you are   inside or outside of a transaction. This is problematic in a   longrunning conversation with an extended Sessionpersistence   context.p blockquote  pSo I am trying with a small example on how this works.

Negative 54712 pIm putting together a site that I want to be responsive to browser resizing. The site pulls one set of CSS styles for a page under 768px, another for any window larger than 768px. p  pI have a javascript slider jcarousel beneath my feature video at.    If I open a window larger than 768px using Chrome, then the javascript slider works fine.  If I reduce the size of the window, the slider is hidden with a displaynone style and other content is shown. And if I resize the window larger, the slider appears and works fine.p  pHowever, and heres my problem ... If I open a browser smaller than 768px, the CSS hides my javascript slider at the start, and shows my other content. But when I resize the window and make it larger over 768px, the slider doesnt work right.  Im assuming the javascript and its associated styles need to be activated initially. Is there a way to get this working when a smaller window is opened firstp
Negative 54712 pIm using nginx and Dojo to build an embedded UI driven by a set of JSON files. Our primary target browser is Chrome, but it should work with all modern browsers.p  pChanging the JSON files can change the UI drastically, and I use this to give different presentations to different users. See my previous question for the details a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions23506626configurenginxtoreturndifferentfilestodifferentauthenticateduserswithConfigure nginx to return different files to different authenticated users with the same URIa, but basically my nginx configuration is such that the same URI with different users can yield different content.p  pThis all works very well, except when someone switches to a different user. Some browsers will grab those JSON files from their own internal cache without even checking with the server, which leaves the UI display the previous users presentation. Reloading the page fixes it, but boy would I rather the right thing happened automatically.p  pThe obvious solution is to use the various cache headers, but they dont appear to help. Im using the following nginx directivesp  precodeexpires epoch etag off ifmodifiedsince off addheader LastModified  codepre  p... which yields the following response headersp  precodeHTTP1.1 200 OK Server nginx1.4.1 Date Wed, 24 Sep 2014 165832 GMT ContentType applicationoctetstream ContentLength 1116 Connection keepalive Expires Thu, 01 Jan 1970 000001 GMT CacheControl nocache AcceptRanges bytes codepre  pThis looks pretty conclusive to me, but the problem still occurs with Chrome 36 for OS X and Opera 24 for OS X although Firefox 29 and 32 do the right thing.

In some points, a few proxy servers are getting out of sync and their cache file size gets stuck and not being updated.p  pSo you can see in the output of my command that there are 7 servers with a cache file size of 36079435 bytes and there are 3 more servers which are out of sync, with a cache file size of 36079435.

Negative 54712 pI have a library where I have a template class which takes a struct type as template argument and does some operations like savedump in file, openopen a file to save the struct data etc.p  precodetemplateltclass Tgt class MyDataSaver codepre  pso the users of the library create their structs with any members they wish and then write size, serialize like simple functions in struct which the template class uses and does the operations. creating new instance of template class p  precodestruct StructType    int i   char ch    int size  return sizeofi  sizeofch   templateltclass Archivegt   void serializeArchive arar amp i amp ch   MyDataSaverltStructTypegt myData  And then myData.save  and myData.open. codepre  pNow my question, I want to convert the library to a dll. How can I restructure this code or create a new class, which can allow the library users to use the dll instead of the library with minimal change in code at library users endp  pOne crude approach I can think of is, create a new template class and have a byte array in it and export this and some how be able to store the struct type through this new class.p  pI want a dynamically linked dllnot those dlls which link with applications using lib files which application can load. So if I make a change in dll, like change the data save media, or use crt file functions rather than OS specific one, the app using the dll should still be able to load and use it as if nothing was changed. So all changes, OTHER than changing the interface should have no impact on application.p

Negative 54712 pI understand that the concept of folder does not exist in AWS S3 and that everything is merely a pair of key amp value. This is actually an issue for me because I have implemented a class to work with S3 to access files and folders. To get the list of folders I have to fetch the list of all keys which may be about 50,000 objects and find out the folders based on the position of  character.p  pI searched the Internet to find an easier way of doing so but I did not find anything. However when I run S3 Browser I see that it can very quickly list the folder names. I tried to sniff the network and see what S3 API is used by S3 Browser and how but since S3 Browser uses SSL I did not go anywhere.p  pCan you please let me know if I can somehow find out all the kes in S3 which represent a folderp  pExamplep  precodeF1 F1F11 F1F11F12 F1F11F12File1.ZIP F1F12F12File2.ZIP F2 F2F1 codepre  pI want to be able to get F1 and F2 quickly without having to retrieve the subdirectories and files.p  pCheersp

The problem is that when I attempt to add a line to the ArrayList that stores all the shapes and then redraw them on the JPanel, the line is being stored but not redrawn.p  pSo, for example, say that I select the line tool from the JMenu at the top. Then I click and drag, and the line appears, from the point where I clicked to the mouses current position. I release the mouse and the line still remains. When I go to draw another line, clicking and dragging, the first one disappears once I release the mouse.

Negative 54712 pI am developing a Facebook Application using Laravel 4 and MySQL. I need to create pending events for those who are invited to join the app. Each invitation will be recorded as pending for the user. Upon joining, they have to finish all those events. If they havent finish them, they will still be redirected to all the list of pending events until they have done everything on it. Only those specific events they have invited on for will be listed. When done, the user will then be redirected to the homepage. Do I still need to create a table for pending events and corresponding Facebook ID I still need to store those Facebook IDs of those who have been invited so I may know the events that was sent to them. My client is suggesting not to create another table only if possible. If this is the case, how can I achieve this since the Facebook user is not yet registered when they received the invitation.p  pThanks in advance. p

Negative 54712 pIm new to theano and Im trying to adapt the autoencoder script a hrefhttpdeeplearning.nettutorialcodedA.py relnofollowherea to work on text data. This code uses the MNIST dataset as training data. This data is in the form of a numpy 2d array. p  pMy data is a csr sparse matrix of about 100,000 instances with about 50,000 features. The matrix is the result of using sklearns tfidfvectorizer to fit and transform the text data. As Im using sparse matrices I modify the code to use the theano.sparse package to represent my input. My training set is the symbolic variable p  precodetrainsetx  theano.sparse.sharedtrainset codepre  pHowever, theano.sparse matrices cannot perform all of the operations used in the original script there is a list of sparse operations a hrefhttpwww.deeplearning.netsoftwaretheanolibrarysparselistofimplementedoperations relnofollowherea. The code uses dot and sum from the tensor methods on the input. I have changed the dot to sparse.dot but I cant find out what to replace the sum with so I am converting the training batches to dense matrices and using the original tensor methods as shown in this cost functionp  precode def getcostself      tildex  self.getcorruptedinputself.x, self.corruption      y  self.gethiddenvaluestildex      z  self.getreconstructedinputy      make dense, must be a better way to do this      L   T.sumSP.densefromsparseself.x  T.logz  1  SP.densefromsparseself.x  T.log1  z, axis1      cost  T.meanL      return cost  def gethiddenvaluesself, input      use theano.sparse.dot instead of T.dot     return T.nnet.sigmoidtheano.sparse.dotinput, self.W  self.b codepre  pThe getcorruptedinput and getreconstructedinput methods remain as they are in the link above. My question is is there a faster way to do this p  pConverting the matrices to dense is making running the training very slow.

Negative 54712 pI currently use the following array formula to find the most common word or number in a range, ignoring any blank cellsp  precodeINDEXD1D10,MODEIFD1D10ltgtISNAMATCHD1D10,A1A1,0,MATCHD1D10,D1D10,0 codepre  pI am now looking to do something slightly different. I still want to find the most common word or number in a range, however I now have 2 lists the first is a list of positive wordsnumbers and the second is a list of negative wordsnumbers. p  pTo illustrate using an example the colour green appears in the positive list 4 times and the colour blue appears twice in the positive list, but green appears 3 times in the negative list and blue does not appear at all in the negative list. Using the above formula on the first list would return green as the most common word. However I now want it to take into account that green is not the most common word given the combined lists i.e. 4 positives  3 negatives  1 green, and 2 positives  0 negatives  2 blue. p  pIn the below image, using the formula under each list shows green to be the most common word. I would like to combine these lists and cancel out any instances where the colour appears on both instances  so 3 of the greens on the positive list would be cancelled out with the 3 greens on the negative list, leaving only one left.p  pIn essence, I suppose I am trying to create a tally or ledger of some kind where rather than numbers that add or subtract I have words whose emfrequencyem is added or subtracted.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comh8RbI.jpg altenter image description herep  pThanks for the help, and apologies if I havent been too clear in the taskp

Negative 54712 pIm a bit stuck with caching of php files which I request via javascript every xx seconds to reload automatically.p  pstrongMy Situationstrongp  pI have one normal PHP file lets call it index.php with a cachecontrol header likep  preheaderCacheControl public, maxage60pre  pand then normal content. Now I have a content block which I request via jquery to be refreshed automatically every 60 seconds. This content block is another PHP file which we call contentblock.php for now.p  pThis .php file have also a cachecontrol header set which is every 30 seconds.p  pstrongProblemstrongp  pAs you will notice now this 30sec header will be in middle of the  content and thus I get a warning about Cannot modify header information... etc. So the reason for this error is clear for me. My problem is that .php files are by default set to 3600 minutes on my server, so once I remove the 30sec cachecontrol header line, the jquery will request the cached file for 3600 minutes max.p  pSo my question is if I can somehow set individual cachecontrol header in a .php file which gets requested via jquery by another php file which have already a cachecontrol header set Its maybe a simple solution to it, but somehow I couldnt find anything useful to this question, so any ideas and advices are welcome p

Negative 54712 pI am looking for a way to take codewindow.location.hostnamecode and end up with the base domain name, regardless of situation. So from all ofp  precodehttpexample.domain.com httpswww.example.domain.com httpswww.example.domain.comstuffindex.php codepre  pI would end up withp  precodedomain.com codepre  pAnd from codeexample.domain.co.ukcode would result codedomain.co.ukcodep  pI have searched many questions on this topic here on SO and it seems like none ever really result in a complete answer. Some involve using complicated regex that its hard to tell if wouldnt sometimes fail. And other answers only net a result of codeexample.domain.comcode. p  pI am utterly floored that there is not just a simple way of getting this value in JavaScript. I am writing a plugin for websites that uses cookies to store user preferences. I am concerned that if a user sets preferences while using the plugin on a page from one hostname, say codeone.domain.comcode, on the off chance they go to use the plugin on another page hosted on codetwo.domain.comcode, they would need to set their preferences all over again. When I set the cookies, I would like to be able to set them sitewide at the codedomain.comcode level. Because this is a plugin, the domain name will not be known and needs to be calculated starting from codewindow.location.hostnamecode.p  pSo is there a standard way of arriving at what Im looking for Or am I just approaching this the wrong way I suppose I could just have a configuration setting for the website owner to input their base domain name and get it that way, but Id prefer not to go that route if possible. And honestly, Id still like to know how to do this anyway. Thanks in advance for any suggestionsp

Negative 54712 pI have a Chrome app Im developing that needs node.js to function. The sequence of events is start node which then hangs the terminal as it doesnt end, start the app, terminate the app, terminate node.p  pAlthough I havent checked it out yet, I believe there must be a way to terminate node from within the app via some call, so lets ignore termination for the moment.p  pSince an app cant make OS calls due to security policy, theres no way for the app to start node. Right Therefore a script is needed to start node and then call chrome to run the app. Problem is that node hangs the script so chrome never gets called unless you send node to the background. When I send node to the background to allow the script to continue, the app cant communicate with it for some reason unknown to me. Why  I also tried a coproc and that also wont provide communications.p  pHow can someone automate starting node and then calling chrome to start an appp

Negative 54712 pbr Maybe the title is not the best, but I would like to get a solution for my SlideView problem.br The SlideView works well with almost every page as I would like, except with ListView and Pivot. Is there a solution to override the horizontal gesture on a ListView to slide the page horizontally to the menu br I think the Pivot case is more complex, because it has 3 PitovItem and I dont know how can I differentiate the horizontal gesture. But maybe somebody has a good idea for it.p  pThanks in advancep
Negative 54712 pI have a rather strange behaviour in an app that is monitoring some CLCircularRegion objects.p  pstrongWhat the app is expected to dostrongp  pWhenever a region is entered or left, an entry in a quite simple UIManagedDocument not located in the iCloud will be updated or created. Furthermore, a NSLocalNotification will be fired telling me which region has been affected and how long the user stayd within the region.p  pstrongWhat really happensstrongp  pThe Notifications are fired as expected, so the delegate methods are fired. Even the duration is calculated correctly. BUT, whenever the app was in background for a longer time  what means about an hour or more  there are no objects updated or created in the UIManagedDocument. This behaviour is hard to debug, because I cannot reproduce it with the debugger attached or in Simulator, just on my iPhone 5S running iOS 8.1.3.p  pstrongWhat I already tried outstrongp  pEven if the UIManagedDocument handles context saving by itself, I tried to call the context saving directly from the location managers delegate method. Without any success. Turning on the location update background capability lead the app to be rejected from the app store, because there is no need to do background location updates when working with region monitoring.p  pstrongQuestionstrongp  pDoes anyone out there face similar problems or knows how to do the trickp  pthank you in advance, Peterp

Lets say I have this table in a Rails projectp  precodecreatetable documents, force true do t    t.text    tags end addindex documents, [tags], name indexdocumentsontags, type fulltext codepre  pI have an integration test that creates a few codeDocumentcode instances with varying tag combinations, which the method Im trying to test should return by way of a fulltext search. Unfortunately, it turns out that InnoDB doesnt rebuild its fulltext indices until the current transaction ends, meaning that my search comes up empty. p  pIf I build the test data in fixtures e.g. in advance, outside of the transaction that rspec uses for each test it all works fine, but is there any way for me to tweak the data and run a search against it within the same test p

Negative 54712 pI have a fairly complicated database set up with lots of foreign key relationships and want to know if there is an easy way to insert an entry into one of these tables.p  pThis is the table that holds some of the foreign keys.p  precodeCREATE TABLE package      id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,     masterid INT NOT NULL UNIQUE,     libraryid INT NOT NULL,     FOREIGN KEY masterid REFERENCES masterid,     FOREIGN KEY libraryid REFERENCES libraryid  DEFAULT CHARSET  utf8 codepre  pWhen this table is set up, it ends up only holding two foreign keys and Primary Key meaning everything in here is numbers. This is what I want to happen but that also means that an codeINSERTcode statement for this table would look likep  precodeINSERT INTO package masterid, libraryid VALUES 235, 12 codepre  por something like that...p  pIs there and way to make a statement likep  precodeINSERT INTO package masterid, libraryid VALUES [masterfield], [libraryfield] codepre  pwhere codemasterfieldcode and codelibraryfieldcode are entries those tables Im not sure how this would be handled either because no other field in the master table is unique so what would happen if there were two entries...p  pAnyway if anyone knows how to do something like that it would be greatly appreciated Doing all this inside MySQL is preferable but I have no problem with doing this using PHP.p

Negative 54712 pI have a bunch of toolstrip buttons with transparent backgrounds in WPF. When the user mouses over the outside of the button, nothing happens, because that part of the button is transparent.

Negative 54712 pI have this assignment in which Im supposed to create a maze solver in Java. The algorithm I decided to apply works the following way its a recursive method to move that calls itself again each time it finds a path. If it runs into a dead end, it calls the second recursive method goBack, which keeps going back until it founds a new path.

Negative 54712 pI am trying to plot arrows pointing at a point on a curve in python using matplotlib.p  pOn this line i need to point vertical arrows at specific points. This is for indicating forces acting on a beam, so their direction is very important. Where the curve is the beam and the arrow is the force.p  pI know the coordinate of said point, exactly, but it is of cause changing with the input. This input should also dictate whether the arrow points upwards or downwards from the line. negative and positive forces applied. I have tried endlessly with plt.arrow, but because the scale changes drastically and so does the quadrant in which the arrow has to be. So it might have to start at y lt 0 and end in a point where y  0. The problem is that the arrowhead length then points the wrong way like this lt. instead of . p  pSo before I go bald because of this, I would like to know if there is an easy way to apply a vertical arrow could be infinite in the opposite direction for all i care pointing to a point on a curve, of which I can control whether it point upwards to the curve, or downwards to the curve.p

The code should define a class LuscherClm and I want be able to do the followingp  precodegtgtgt c40Luscher4,0 gtgtgt gtgtgt c400.12 gtgtgt ltprint the result of the evaluationgt codepre  pFirst question at the moment I would have to do something likep  precodegtgtgt c40Luscher.init4,0 gtgtgt gtgtgt c40.eval0.12 Segfault  codepre  pMy first question is therefore how do I have to modify the method table to have more operatorstyle casts instead of the member functions init and eval.p  pHowever, my code has other problems and here is the relevant part the underlying C class works smoothly, I use it in production a lotp  pThe destructorp  precodedestructor static void clmdestructPyObject capsule     void ptrPyCapsuleGetPointercapsule,zetfunc     Zetafunc zetptrstaticcastltZetafuncgtptr     delete zetptr     return  codepre  pThe constructor it returns the pointer to the capsule. I do not know whether this is correct. Because in this case when I call, clmLuscherClm.initl,m, the clm object is a PyCapsule and has no attribute eval so that I cannot call clm.evalx on that. How should this be handledp  precodeconstructor static PyObject clminitPyObject self, PyObject args     return value     PyObject resultNULL      parse variables     unsigned int lval0     int mval0     ifPyArgParseTupleargs,li,amplval,ampmval         stdcout ltlt Please specify l and m ltlt stdendl         return result           class instance     Zetafunc zetfuncnew Zetafunclval,mval     instanceCapsulePyCapsuleNewstaticcastltvoidgt   zetfunc,zetfunc,ampclmdestruct     return instanceCapsule  codepre  pSo how is the capsule passed to the evaluate function the code below is not correct since I have not updated it after moving from CObjects to Capsules.

Negative 54712 pIm trying to figure out how best to architect my app.  But for starters trying to understand typical practices with respect to where to put things, and how the app should wire up to things like server.js, how server.js should work, and how you keep a persistent connection open for the website, and any backend services or modules.p  pThis is a general question but let me try to be more specific, as specific as I can since I am new to Node.. and for a basis to start on with this question.p  pLets say I plan on designing a simple Express App.p  pIve got this kind of structure for example so farp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com61HxO.png altenter image description herep  pRight now in strongserver.jsstrong, I am just playing around with trying to connect to a mySQL database.

So in it I have youre typical stuff like setting the view, var app  express, importing an express route definition from another module in my routesindex.js, stuff like that.p  pif Im going to keep a database connection open, or other things open, how is that best organizeddone by conventionp  pIf you look at this example code, hes moving the var app  express definition into service.js a hrefhttpsgithub.commadhumsnodeexpressmongoosedemoblobmasterserver.js relnofollowhttpsgithub.commadhumsnodeexpressmongoosedemoblobmasterserver.jsa.  He keeps an open connection running and started from there, which makes sense, hence server.p  pso should app.js do much  what is best practice or scope of what this should be doing.  Once I start modularizing things out into their own .js files and node modules, how does the app.js morph through all those refactorings, meaning in the end whats its role and is it very thin in the end where its just used to wire stuff upp  pThen what should strongwww.jsstrong which is now required by express 4 have and its rolep  pIts kinda hard for me to start with just one aspect so Im kinda going all over the place here in the above.  I just want to know common conventions for putting stuff in app.js vs. server.js and then best way to keep and managed open connections to things...both in the backend and frontend such as http requests coming in, what should be the central point  routes of course but then so is app.js responsible for referencing routes  p  pI have found a few resources such as a hrefhttpwww.terlici.com20140825bestpracticesexpressstructure.html relnofollowthisa but looking for more so if you know any or have any input, please reply.  Im more interested in the talk around app.js, server.js, connections, www.js, and where things should wire up to each other with these particular specific parts.

Negative 54712 pWell, Im migrating my Android project to use the Clean Architecurep  pa hrefhttpsgithub.comandroid10AndroidCleanArchitecture relnofollowhttpsgithub.comandroid10AndroidCleanArchitectureap  pThis means that part of my code is within the domain module pure Java, no dependency with Android. For this project, Im using Dagger 2, that generates source using the annotation processor during compile time.p  pI have the following Gradles configuration for my projectp  precodeapply plugin java  sourceCompatibility  1.7 targetCompatibility  1.7  configurations      provided   sourceSets      main          compileClasspath  configurations.provided         runtimeClasspath  configurations.provided          test          compileClasspath  configurations.provided         runtimeClasspath  configurations.provided        dependencies      def domainDependencies  rootProject.ext.domainDependencies     def domainTestDependencies  rootProject.ext.domainTestDependencies      provided domainDependencies.daggerCompiler     provided domainDependencies.javaxAnnotation      compile domainDependencies.dagger     compile domainDependencies.rxJava     compile domainDependencies.joda      testCompile domainTestDependencies.junit     testCompile domainTestDependencies.assertJ     testCompile domainTestDependencies.mockito     testCompile domainTestDependencies.jMockLegacy     testCompile domainTestDependencies.commonsCsv  codepre  pIn my test source, I created the interface TestComponent and the Dagger is suposed to generate the DaggerTestComponent. When I try to build my project either through command line or Android Studio, I receive compilation errors of strongcannot find symbolstrong and then strongExecution failed for task domaincompileTestJavastrong.p  pI tried to change the provided with compile and testCompile. Its still not working.p  pWhat is strange is that, after the failure of the compileTestJava, I can find the generated DaggerTestComponent.java in strongdomainbuildclassesteststrong. So, if its being generated, why am I receiving this compile errorp  pIts important to note that this problem only happens in the test source. I have generated source of Dagger 2 being used in the main source.p  pUPDATEp  pI commented every place that was trying to use the DaggerTestComponent and tried to build again. In the strongdomainbuildclassesteststrong, now I can find not only the DaggerTestComponent.java but also the .class resulted of the compilation. So, its generating the source file and compiling it. Why is the compilation of files using it not working It seems like some order problem, like the generated source isnt ready yet at the time of the compile of the other sources.p
Negative 54712 pI am trying to write a code that will basically ask the user to input 5 names. It will then create a list of those names, and print them out. Subsequently, it prints a sorted version of the list. Next, the code will print the third name in the list.

I needed to take a break from this project to work on something else for a while.When I came back to it a week ago to make a release of the game, there was a robovm update and things started to fall apart afterwards. Robovm got bumped up to 1.3, which caused compilation errors in source code. I tried o upgrade libgdx to 1.6.2 but it didnt help at all. I am almost at release phase and I do NOT want to deal with code changes at all, not to exhaust my testers.p  pI restored my projecteclipse installation from an earlier backup I have.

Negative 54712 pSuppose we have a function which accesses some globally shared data  and suppose this function will be called by multiple concurrent threads.p  pNaturally, we need to somehow synchronize access to this data.  Is it possible to do this via a mechanism where we have an atomic flag, and whichever thread manages to set the flag can then proceed to access the shared data  Whereas the losing threads will not block on a lock, but simply return from the function.p  pSomething like the followingp  pGiven some globally shared data along with a synchronization flagp  precodenamespace global     int x   int y    stdatomicflag syncflag  ATOMICFLAGINIT   codepre  pAnd our function which will be accessed by concurrent threadsp  precodevoid race      See if we won the race        if globalsyncflag.testandset            We won              globalx  10       globaly  11        else           We lost...       return      codepre  pDoes the above code guarantee that codeglobalxcode and codeglobalycode will be safely accessed by only a single thread, and that no race conditions will occur  Or is this emnotem guaranteed due to memory ordering problemsp  pNote we never actually locked a mutex or anything, so no thread ends up blocking.  The idea here is simply to ensure that only one thread is allowed to access nonatomic global variables here.p  pOf course, after the winning thread is done, we would need to somehow safely clear the atomic flag if we ever intend on calling coderacecode again.  That is a problem I havent thought much about yet, but it is really beyond the scope of this question.p  pSo is the above code racecondition free for a single call to coderacecodep

Negative 54712 pIm building a meteorjs app and deploying it as a native cordova app for Android and iOS.p  pI need to deep link to my app, so I can launch it by following a link on a website.p  pIve implemented URL Scheme using the cordova plugin by Eddy Verbruggen a hrefhttpsgithub.comEddyVerbruggenCustomURLscheme relnofollowhttpsgithub.comEddyVerbruggenCustomURLschemea and I managed to get my app launched by following a link of the myapp format.p  pThe problem is that, even though the app is getting successfully launched, the handleOpenUrl hook is not getting triggered. p  precodeMeteor.startupfunction      handleOpenURL  function handleOpenURLurl          console.logreceived url   url          parse url and proceed accordingly       codepre  pNothing gets logged. So I have no way of passing any parameters to my app, or even detect that the app was launched via a link that follows the myapp URL scheme.p  pAlso, I noticed that even though my app is already open, if I switch to the browser and click on a special myapp link, instead of switching to my already open app, a new instance of the app is getting launched.p  pem[edit] Turned out the two problems were related. Once I prevented a new instance of the app from being initialized, the handleOpenUrl function was triggered successfully.emp  pIm using the Android emulator for all my tests. I havent had the chance to test on iOS yet.p  pem[edit] iOS didnt give this problem at all. It was only an Android problem.emp  pIf anyone out there has any experience on implementing custom URL scheme in meteorjs, your feedback is much appreciatedp

Negative 54712 pIm writing an app in JavaFX that needs to occasionally load large CSV files around 1,000,000 lines long or possibly more.p  pWhen a user clicks a button to start loading the file, a Service is started to load the contents, with a progresscancel dialog showing in the meantime. The codecallcode method in the Service is basically a while loop that loads another line from the CSV file on each iteration.p  pThe problem is that when I start the service, the progress bar indeterminate style becomes jerky. Dragging the dialog is also jerky and laggy.p  pI wasnt having good luck searching on the web for a solution, but the closest I found was to put a codeThread.sleepcode in the loop, giving other things like GC a chance to catch up.p  pThis solution seemed to reduceremove the stuttering, but it would add a lot of time to loading the data. I am also guessing that the exact time to sleep would vary between different processors.p  pIs there any way to dynamically figure out how longoften to sleep for Or call some method that would block for just long enough to keep the GUI responsivep  pThe code for my servicep  precodepublic class CSVLoadingService extends ServiceltListltObservableListltDoublePropertygtgtgt  private ObjectPropertyltFilegt srcFile  new SimpleObjectPropertyltgt private IntegerProperty startIndex  new SimpleIntegerProperty0 private ObjectPropertyltCharactergt csvDelimeter  new SimpleObjectPropertyCSVParser.DEFAULTSEPARATOR private DoubleProperty invalidCSVReplacement  new SimpleDoubleProperty0 private ObjectPropertyltDialoggt dialog  new SimpleObjectPropertyltgtnull  Override protected TaskltListltObservableListltDoublePropertygtgtgt createTask      return new TaskltListltObservableListltDoublePropertygtgtgt          final ObjectPropertyltFilegt srcFile  srcFile         final IntegerProperty startIndex  startIndex         final ObjectPropertyltCharactergt csvDelimeter  csvDelimeter         final DoubleProperty invalidCSVReplacement  invalidCSVReplacement          Override         protected ObservableListltObservableListltDoublePropertygtgt call throws Exception              if startIndex.getValue lt 0                 throw new IllegalArgumentExceptionStart index cant be negative.             if srcFile.getValue  null                 throw new IllegalStateExceptionFile cant be null.              final ObservableListltObservableListltDoublePropertygtgt result  FXCollections.observableArrayList               Read the data from the CSV file.             try final CSVReader reader  new CSVReadernew BufferedReadernew FileReadersrcFile.getValue,                     csvDelimeter.getValue,                     CSVParser.DEFAULTQUOTECHARACTER,                     startIndex.getValue                               Read first line.

If I use the new version of the code only, the code breaks. Basically I want to use both jar files legacy and the newer version. How do I tell spring to differentiate since the class names are the same in both jar files  If possible, would you please provide an example p  pThe ideal solution would be to remove the legacy code, however for this particular instance, I just need to make a quick modification to it. p

Negative 54712 pI have a problem while Im working on a search function at Windows Access that allowed me to search after 3 things. In this case, its first name, Last name and CPR. Now the CPR means its a serial of unique numbers to each users on my Database. p  pIt started as a macro then I changed it into VBA code because I want it to have the option to search after 3.p  pwhen its in macro, it can only find 2 things because the limit for write characters in macro is 255, which is the reason that I changed it to VBA code which the characters limit should be unlimited.p  pAh, I almost forgot, the codes in danish, but I think the basic functions of the code is almost pretty much same everywhere so...p  pHere is the problem p  precodeOn Error GoTo SgEfterFornavnErr      If IsNullFormsNavigationsformularNavigationUnderformularSearchFor Then         Beep         Exit Function     Else         DoCmd.SetFilter Sgnings foresprgelse, [Fornavn] Like  amp [Forms][Navigationsformular][NavigationUnderformular][SearchFor] amp  Or [CPR] Like  amp [Forms][Navigationsformular][NavigationUnderformular][SearchFor] amp  Or [Efternavn] Like  amp [Formularer][Navigationsformular][NavigationUnderformular][SearchFor] amp ,          Exit Function     End If   SgEfterFornavnExit     Exit Function  SgEfterFornavnErr     MsgBox Error     Resume SgEfterFornavnExit codepre  pIt keeps saying that Syntax error missing a comma in query expression  which I dont understand Did I do something wrong orp
Negative 54712 pI was thinking R does not use pointers nor references. However, I have faced the issue of dynamic changes into a function. Heres a MWE to make my point clearp  precodegt a  functionx 2 gt b  functionx ax gt b4 [1] 2 gt a  functionx 3 gt b4 [1] 3 codepre  pwhile I was expecting changing codeacode wont change codebcode. For example, if I dop  precodegt a  functionx 2 gt b   a gt b4 [1] 2 gt a  functionx 3 gt b4 [1] 2 codepre  pI understand in the first case no copy of codeacode is done instead R looks for a function codeacode into the GlobalEnvir each time I call codebcode while in the second one it makes a copy, is that correct  But if my function codeacode is iteratively modified while I want codebcode to use it as it was at the right moment where I defined codebcode, what is the right way to do it. For now, I have thought using a copy of codeacodep  precodegt a  functionx 2 gt aa  a gt b  functionx aax gt b4 [1] 2 gt a  functionx 3 gt b4 [1] 2 codepre  pbut this wont work if I update codeacode more than once because Ill also update codeaacode.p  pthanksp
