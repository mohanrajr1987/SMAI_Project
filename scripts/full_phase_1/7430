This integer need not remain consistent from one execution of an application to another execution of the same applicationp  pDoes this mean following hashmap.putmyObject, objectValue When the map is passed over the network or is serialized and deserialized at the other end and we do hashmap.getmyObject, then we mightmightnot get objectValue in returnp  pI have seen in applications where a webservice request is sent over a network to another server and request contains hashmap with some key value pairs and when the get operation is done on hashmap at the receiving server, it returns the same  object everytime. But the key in those cases is String. Will I not get the same object , had my key object is not String Is it that when I override the hashCode in my customized object being used as key and considering a good implementation of hashcode, then I will get the same results over networks or even after serializing and deserializing. What is the best way to make sure I get the consistent results on hashmap everytimep

Positive 7430 pFor a homework assignment which is stated asp  pIn this homework, you will implement a keyvalue hash map with a external chaining collision policy. A hash map maps keys to values and allows O1 average case lookup of a value when the key is known. This hash map must be backed by an array of initial size 11, and must have a size of 2n  1 when the table exceeds greater than, not greater than or equal to a load factor of 0.67. The array must be resized before the new key regardless of whether or not its a duplicate is actually added into the array. The load factor and initial size values are provided as constants in the interface and should be used within your code.p  pWere given a MapEntry class already written, and a HashMap class to write up. How would I intialize this array codeprivate MapEntryltK, Vgt[] table  new MapEntryltgt[STARTINGSIZE]code doesnt work because of the generics situation.p

Positive 7430 pThe scenario is a kind of simple.p  pI get a value, in range between code0 and 2x x27code. Now i would like to use this value also as key for a hashmap. In the hashmap I then just store an index source of the value. x may be also greater then 27, so I have to use a memory efficient data structure.br I first tried an unorderedmultimap, but there is a big overhead, disqualifying it. Then i tried an unorderedmap of vectors. But by increasing number of vectors in the map, the overhead is also too big. So I thought of just using a 2d Array with reallocating for dynamic size.br But as I learned here on stackoverflow calling 227 times malloc creates also an overhead, so i tried thisp  precodeuint64t length  uint64t pow2.0,27 uint64t  hashmap hashmap  uint64t  mallocsizeof  hashmap  length uint64t  values  uint64t  mallocsizeof  values  3  length   forint i  0iltlengthi     hashmap[i]  values  3  i  Destroys the whole datastructure hashmap[0]  uint64t  reallochashmap[0],sizeofhashmap[0]4 codepre  pI allocate code3  siezof  valuescode to keep track of actual length and maximal length of the bucket. br But as the comment says the reallocating destroys the whole arrray, maybe because there is no bookkeeping via malloc on the pointer  that it just stores 3 elements Is there a way to do a realloc on this structure Or do u even know a better structure for my intendp  pEdit cause of dausamas Answerp  pWhile using the following Code, Im excpierencing performance problems runtime and memoryp  precodestdunorderedmap ltuint64t, stdvectorltuint64tgtgt m uint64t length  1ULltlt22 forint i  0  iltlengthi      m.emplacei,vectorltuint64tgt     m.ati.pushbacki  codepre  pI reduced the length to 222 cause i aborted the 227 implementation at a runtime of 7 Minutes and a memory usage of 8GB. br This snippet has a runtime of 60 seconds and a memory usage of 1.7GB. Compared to the above array implementation thats alot, array took 4GB of memory and a runtime of 1.7 seconds at 227 elements. Maybe Im doing something wrongp

Positive 7430 pI have a problem which is about creating a map with 2 different keys. The keys would possibly be of the same type though. The question is similar to this,p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7921863howtocreateamapwith2keyvalueHow to create a map with 2 key valueap  pBut it does also differ since the keys does not need to be set at the same time. So more concretely, the properties should be that,p  p1 One of the keys are sufficient to get a value from the map.p  p2 In case one of the keys are set, the other key can be set given the first key.p  p3 The user should not need to bother what key it uses the first or the secondp  pThe theory is to implement this using 2 maps as this,p  precodepublic MultiKeyMapltK1, K2, Vgt   private HashMapltK1 , Vgt map1 private HashMapltK2, Vgt map2  public MultiKeyMap     map1  new HashMapltK1, Vgt     map2  new HashMapltK2, Vgt   public void putK1 k1, V v            public void getK1 k1, V v            public void putK1 k1, K2 k2, V v     map1.putk1, v     map2.putk2, v  codepre  pHowever, when I get to the part with one value I get confused, The keys may both be of the same type eg. String, so how would I make a difference between the values. One alternative would be, that in case the second value is of the same type as the first, then I just add it to the first map using duplicate values. Would this be a good option My point is, this would affect the syntax since the user would still just call codemyMap.getmyKeycode, further, I would also guess this would be an optimization since I only need one map. I would just need a flag like codeboolean secondKeyAvail  falsecode. I should be able to handle 2 by myself. This is more to give context and motivate why this question is not the same as the linked one.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pDue to some of the comments I will try to clarify a bit. This is the scenario. Before I need to read the map I will encounter one of keys always the same one. However, this key object may sometimes not be accessible at the time I need to read the map. I will then have a default value which is not added to the map. However, in this case I will have the second key, and if this happen I would have been able to set the second key using the first key. However, if the key is of the same type I will not know if I have the K1 key or the K2 key with the call myMap.getmyKey.p

Negative 7430 pI have clients that need to all connect to a single server process. I am using UDP discovery for the clients to find the server. I have the client and server exchange IP address and port number, so that a TCPIP connection can be established after completion of the discovery. This way the packet size is kept small. I see that this could be done in one of two ways using UDPp  ol liEach client sends out its own multicast message in search of the server, which the server then responds to. The client can repeat sending this multicast message in regular intervals in the case that the server is down until the server responds.li liThe server sends out a multicast message beacon at regular intervals. The clients subscribe to the multicast group and in this way receives the servers multicast message and complete the discovery.li ol  pIn 1. if there are many clients then initially there would be many multicast messages transmitted one from each client. Only the server would subscribe and receive the multicast messages from the clients. Once the server has responded to the client, the client ceases to send out the multicast message. Once all clients have completed their discovery of the server no further multicast messages are transmitted on the network. If however, the server is down, then each client would be sending out a multicast message beacon in intervals until the server is back up and can respond.  p  pIn 2. only the server would submit a multicast message beacon in regular intervals. This message would end up getting routed to all clients that are subscribed to the multicast group. Once the clients receive the packet the clients UDP listening socket gets closed and they are no longer subscribed to the multicast group. However, the server must continue to send the multicast beacon, so that new clients can discover it. It would continue sending out the beacon at regular intervals regardless of whether any clients are out their requiring discovery or not.p  pSo, I see pros and cons either way. It seems to me that 1 would result in heavier load initially, but this load eventually reduces down to zero. In 2 the server would continue sending out a beacon forever.p  pUDP and multicast is a fairly new topic to me, so I am interested in finding out which would be the preferred approach and which would result in less network load.p

I think this is due to the fact that the war is not finding this library, even though it is in the codelibcode folderclasspath.  If I try to uncomment the first two modules to add the first party libraries codecore.jarcode and codetag.jarcode, all of a sudden the properties files can no longer be found they are located, for now, in codelibclassescode, so that, I hope anyway, they are picked up by the classloader.  Ideally Id like to put classes in its own directory and add it to the classpath separately, but for now I am just trying to make this work.  p  pI have tried some other things, including manually adding codecore.jarcode to the wars codemanifest.mfcode file, changing codeUseJBossWebLoadercode to true in the codejbossservice.xmlcode file under the codejbossweb.deployercode, and various combinations of the above, to no success.  I either lose the codeclassescode directory from the classpath codelibcode folder and none of my properties files get picked up, or the war cant access the proper class from the jar.  I think there must be some configuration that is wrong, and while Ive tried reading up on the way JBoss does EAR deployments and classloading, I cant seem to adapt it to my current setup.  p  pAny suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  p  pHere are some sites that I have been looking atbr a hrefhttpraibledesigns.comrdentryjbossclassloaderlogic relnofollowRaible Designs JBoss ClassLoader Logica  p  pThese are just a few of the sites I have looked at.  The problems might stem from the setup of the project as well, as this is a large established project that is to an extent being migrated from a weblogic deployment to Jboss.  So if there is anything that SHOULD work, but doesnt, it might be an issue with some of the codeproject configuration.  Unfortunately, I am not at the point yet where I can tell if its a JBoss related problem, or a problem with the project.p

Negative 7430 pI recently sat down to port a simple Rails app I have to JSF using Seam to get a feel for which I would be more productive in. The Rails app is RESTful, which I like. Upon starting into JSF, I was surprised to learn, perhaps incorrectly, that JSF only support POSTs, which makes it inherently nonRESTful.p  pI searched around a bit but cannot find a satisfactory answer. JSFSeam appears to be very popular, but it doesnt make sense to me that it would forbid all HTTP methods but POST. Is it true that JSF inherently does not allow for a RESTful architecture, or am I wrong and RESTful JSF is possible inherently or through a pluginp

Negative 7430 pI am new to iphone development. I want to display the actual size of the image in image view. I have created image view by using Interface builder and set the properties. Now the problem is, I have set into Scale to Fill, then the image will be stretched in the full screen. Now i want to display the actual size of the image will be displayed in image view. For example 52X52 size image should be displayed with the same size in the image view.The  1200X1020 size image should be fit to the size of the image view .So according the size of the image it should fit to image view and i want the image smaller than image view should retain its original sizeIt should not stretch to fit the image view. Is it any possible solution to achieve it, please guide me.p  pThanks. p

Negative 7430 pHi    Im not a CSS expert so I might be missing something obvious. Im trying to set a relative size header and footer so that on larger monitors, the header and footer are larger than on smaller screens. To do this, Im using a percentage height. However, this only works if I set the codepositioncode to codeabsolutecode. The problem is, setting it to absolute means that it overlaps the main part of the screen inbetween the header and footer. Setting it to relative doesnt work since it relies on items being inside the headerfooter. This is what my header looks likep  precode.header      positionabsolute     top0px     backgroundcolorwhite     width100      height30   codepre  pthe ASPX page simply containsp  precodeltdiv classheadergtltdivgt codepre  pIs there a way to get relatively proportioned header and footersp  pThanksp

That should be fast, since, we can figure out the exact 200 rows, due to the nested index. And then sort the resulting 192003800 rows.p  pIf one were to implement it in the most optimal way, you would put a heap from the set of all blogid based streams and pick the one with the maxpublished and repeat it 200 times.

Negative 7430 pIm reading data from a custom data format that conceptually stores data in a table. Each column can have a distinct type. The types are specific to the file format and map to C types.p  pI have a Column type that encapsulates the idea of a column, with generic parameter T indicating the C type that is in the column. The Column.FormatType indicates the type in terms of the format types. So to read a value for a column, I have a simple methodp  precodeprotected T readColumnValueltTgtColumnltTgt column    switch column.FormatType        case FormatType.Int       return TreadInt     codepre  pHow simple and elegant Now all I have to do isp  precodeColumnltintgt columnnew Columnltintgt... int valuereadColumnValuecolumn codepre  pThe above cast to type T would work in Java albeit with a warning, and because of erasure the cast would not be evaluated until the value was actually used by the callerat which point a ClassCastException would be thrown if the cast wasnt correct.p  pThis doesnt work in C. However, because C doesnt throw away the generic types it should be possible to make it even better I appears that I can ask for the type of T at runtimep  precodeType valueTypetypeofT codepre  pGreatso I have the type of value that Ill be returning. What can I do with it If this were Java, because there exists a Class.Cast method which performs a runtime cast, I would be home free  Because each Java Class class has a generic type parameter indicating of the class is for it would also provide compiletime type safety. The following is from my dreamworld where C Type class works like the Java Class classp  precodeprotected T readColumnValueltTgtColumnltTgt column    TypeltTgt valueTypetypeofT   switch column.FormatType        case FormatType.Int       return valueType.CastreadInt     codepre  pObviously there is no Type.Castso what do I dop  pYes, I know there is a Convert.ChangeType method, but that seems to perform conversions, not make a simple cast.p  pUpdate So its seeming like this is simply not possible without boxingunboxing using TobjectreadInt. But this is not acceptable. These files are really big80MB, for example. Lets say I want to read an entire column of values. Id have an elegant little method that uses generics and calls the method above like thisp  precodepublic T[] readColumnltTgtColumnltTgt column, int rowStart, int rowEnd, T[] values    ...  seek to column start   for int row  rowStart row lt rowEnd row        values[row  rowStart]  readColumnValuecolumn     ... seek to next row codepre  pBoxingunboxing for millions of values That doesnt sound good. I find it absurd that Im going to have to throw away generics and resort to readColumnInt, readColumnFloat, etc. and reproduce all this code just to prevent boxingunboxingp  precodepublic int[] readColumnIntColumnltintgt column, int rowStart, int rowEnd, int[] values    ...  seek to column start   for int row  rowStart row lt rowEnd row        values[row  rowStart]  readInt     ... seek to next row  public float[] readColumnFloatColumnltfloatgt column, int rowStart, int rowEnd, float[] values    ...  seek to column start   for int row  rowStart row lt rowEnd row        values[row  rowStart]  readFloat     ... seek to next row codepre  pThis is pitiful. p

Negative 7430 pstrongBRIEF SUMMARY OF WHAT I WANTstrong If I take a file name as argument of a function, how do I include that file name in the path location such that the name of the file in the path location is the one user enters. If you didnt understand what I am saying, then read below for explanationp  pstrongSECONDARY EXPLANATIONstrong p  pI am making a general function which requires calling a software called CMG. The software needs a code.datcode file, whose name I am taking as argument in the function with general name in the argument as codeReservoirModelCMGBuildercode. As  you can see in the partial code below, this codeReservoirModelCMGBuildercode file is kept in a folder whose path location I have entered. However the problem is since the file name is in quotes, so it does not identify the file name in the code. What I want is I take name of the .dat file name, needed for CMG, from the user and store it in name codeReservoirModelCMGBuildercode, and then use this name in the path location to pick up that file.p  pSimilarly I want to do this thing for codeReportqrwdcode and codeReportqrwocode.

Negative 7430 pWe have inherited a very convolved project 500kloc with a stronglotstrong of preprocessor conditional logic, most of which is no longer relevant, and I want to clean it up. p  pIdeally codecppcode or another tool could be used to expand only emsomeem of the conditional logic, and leave all other preprocessor macros, defines, and includes alone in the output.p  pFor instance, suppose we have this set of codep  precodeinclude ltfoogt define baz define bara doa1                 while0 ifdef X   if Y gt 20     if Z gt 5       sofarsogood  true     endif     ifdef baz     something     endif   else     otherthing   endif else   if Z gt 10     wow.this.is.bad   endif endif codepre  pThe tool I want and might write if Stackoverflow cant find something would be a version of CPP that accepts not only the list of definitions for a particular invocation, but also a list of defines to respect during expansion. Any preprocessor symbol not in the second list is completely left alone. An example is in orderp  precodecpptreadlight DY22 onlyY codepre  pwould producep  precodeinclude ltfoogt define baz define bara doa1                 while0 ifdef X     if Z gt 5       sofarsogood  true     endif     ifdef baz     something     endif else   if Z gt 10     wow.this.is.bad   endif endif codepre  pandp  precodecpptreadlight DY22 DZ8 DX onlyY,baz,Z codepre  pwould give mep  precodeinclude ltfoogt define bara doa1                 while0 ifdef X       sofarsogood  true     something else endif codepre  pNotice that even though codeXcode is defined, it was left behind, because it didnt appear in the codeonlycode list. Also note that codebazcode emwasem in the codeonlycode list, and so was expanded once it was defined in the source.p  pI tried a hacksolution escaping uninteresting stuff using a pipeline like the following my own gsub tool is used, but it does what you might expectp  precodefunction escapetr      gsub defineinclude 1 lt 1        echo include simple.h ampamp gsub            cpp C P DY301 DZ gt 1.new   codepre  pNow I can filter out a lot of stuff, and then put the things I want the preprocessor to expand in codesimple.hcode. Comments are left alone, and codelinecode directives are left out.p  pThis emalmostem does the trick, in that includes are not pulled in, codedefinecode blocks are not defined, and so not expanded into the body. But of course it doesnt let me specify the set of conditional logic that Id like to keep in the output. Thats bad. Some of it is important to keep conditional. p  pcodeifcode nests, and the codeelsecode and codeendifcode tokens dont lexically match, putting the problem beyond a regex pipeline. I need a fullblown parser, something practically identical to cpp itself, but with finer grained control of what is expanded. p  pHence, before digging into a preprocessor to implement, I thought Id ask if anyone has seen such a tool before. I cant be the only one to have inherited a preprocessor spagetti nest full of dead branches. p

Negative 7430 pIm creating a forum, and I want to keep track of which threads have been updated since the user last visited. So I have an array that I keep in SESSION that is basically structured as code[boardid][threadid]  1code. If the threadid and boardid are set, then the thread has not been read and the board contains unread threads. When a user views a thread, I just codeunsetcode the appropriate board and thread id. However, Ive having problems with getting unset to work with arrays like this.p  pFirstly, I have a session class to make handling session data a little nicerp  precodeclass Session  private namespace  public function constructnamespace  default      thisgtnamespace  namespace      Erase all variables in the namespace   public function clear      unsetSESSION[thisgtnamespace]   public function setname, value      SESSION[thisgtnamespace][name]  value   public function getname      ifissetSESSION[thisgtnamespace] ampamp arraykeyexistsname, SESSION[thisgtnamespace]          return SESSION[thisgtnamespace][name]           return null   public function issetname      return issetSESSION[thisgtnamespace][name]    public function unsetname      unsetSESSION[thisgtnamespace][name]    codepre  pThen I have a CurrentUser class representing the current user.

I also have methods to remove board and threads from the array.p  precode    public function buildUnreadListsince       Build a new since last visit list     forumModel  new ModelForum     newThreads  forumModelgtfetchThreadsSinceDatesince     foreachnewThreads as thread          tmp amp thisgtunreadThreadsList         tmp[thread[board]][thread[id]]  1                     public function removeThreadFromUnreadListboardid, threadid      threads amp thisgtunreadThreadsList     unsetthreads[boardid][threadid]      public function removeBoardFromUnreadListboardid      threads amp thisgtdatagtunreadThreadsList     unsetthreads[boardid]  codepre  pThis is where Im running into problems. Im getting a codeIndirect modification of overloaded property SessionunreadThreadsList has no effectcode error on codethreads amp thisgtdatagtunreadThreadsListcode How can I either fix this problem or design a better solution I thought about creating a class that keeps track of the array so I dont have to have an array of arrays of arrays of arrays, but Im not certain on persisting objects and creating an object just to manage an array feels really dirty to me.p

Negative 7430 pI honestly have no idea if this question has been asked before, or something similar like it. Its hard to search on such a thing.p  pSo, here goes. I would like my webpage to run a program PHP would be the correct choice here, yes hosted on the server, and then use the output of that program to print to a webpage. However, the program doesnt print its output all at once, thus, when Ive tried this before, it waits until the program exits successfully before printing output, rather than printing it as it is received. Which makes sensep  pHow would one go about printing output to the webpage as each new result is returned That is, after displaying the webpage, have entries be added to a div as the program outputs lines of text.p  pAjax Javascript Im just looking for what the be the correct way to go about this, not code.p

Negative 7430 pNot sure if anyone has run into this issue. I am trying to use oozie for running a simple MapReduce job that searches for a string value in HDFS location and if it finds it it outputs it.  When I submit the job, oozie successfully executes but I dont get the expected output.  It seems that my mapper never was invoked since it did not filter out any of the expected results.

Negative 7430 pstrongSummarystrongp  pFor some reason, my member function template that invokes a lambda function fails to compile with emerror C2275 ... illegal use of this type as an expressionem, but when the function is moved out to be a free function it compiles correctly.p  pstrongDetailsstrongp  pFirst I have a base class that keeps codefunctioncode instances in a codevectorcode. Only derived classes can add codefunctioncode instances to that codevectorcode by calling codeaddexternalcode. All codefunctioncode instances can be publicly invoked by calling codeinvokeexternalscode. A derived class will add lambdas as codefunctioncode instances. Those lambdas will in turn call the base class function template codeinvokeinternalcode with another inner lambda. The template parameter to codeinvokeinternalcode is an exception type that will be explicitly caught when executing the inner lambda in codeinvokeinternalcodep  precodeusing namespace std  class base  public     void invokeexternals              for auto it  funcs.begin it  funcs.end it                      it                protected     void addexternalfunctionltvoidvoidgt func              funcs.pushbackfunc           template lttypename Tgt     void invokeinternalfunctionltvoidvoidgt func              try                      func                  catch const Tamp         catch ...           vectorltfunctionltvoidvoidgtgt funcs  codepre  pThen I have two trivial free functions that throws codelogicerrorcode and coderuntimeerrorcode exceptions. These functions are to be used in the inner lambda that is invoked in codeinvokeinternalcode p  precodevoid throwslogicerror      throw logicerror   void throwsruntimeerror      throw runtimeerror  codepre  pIn the codederivedcode class constructor, two lambdas are added with codeaddexternalcode. Each of those lambdas call codeinvokeinternalcode with inner lmbdas. The first call to codeinvokeinternalcode will explicitly catch the codelogicerrorcode that codethrowslogicerrorcode will throw. The second call to codeinvokeinternalcode will explicitly catch the coderuntimeerrorcode that codethrowsruntimeerrorcode will throw.p  precodeclass derived  public base  public     derived              addexternal[this]                      invokeinternalltlogicerrorgt[]                              throwslogicerror                                addexternal[this]                      invokeinternalltruntimeerrorgt[]                              throwsruntimeerror                              codepre  pAnd to tie all this together, codederivedcode is instantiated and codeinvokeexternalscode is called to invoke the external lambdas added in the codederivedcode constructor.

Negative 7430 pLets say I want to create a website that contains one page.  All the content is dynamic and generated using JavaScript with DOM replacement.  The good thing about this is that it creates a better user experience, especially for applications that contain catalogues online stores, galleries, etc.  The problem now comes with linking.  Lets say Im browsing the site and I feel like sharing that particular thing Im looking at with someone, but the problem is the link is always the same since its JavaScript thats doing the magic.  So the question comes  how can I create a fully JavaScript run website while maintaining the ability to linkp  pNow theres hash linking, but Im failing miserably.

Device and Interface. p  pA Device have some Interfaces.br  Device class have the following methodes p  ul livoid addInterface String nameli livoid removeInterface Interface ili liInterface getInterface Interface i    I should have wrote  Interface getInterface String interfaceName li livoid printAllInterfaceli ul  pInterface class have the following methodes p  ul livoid connectInterface Interface interfaceToConnectTo li livoid disconnectInterface Interface interfaceToDisconnectFrom li livoid printAllConnectionli ul  pBasically, I create two device, add some interfaces to each and finally make some connection between interfaces.p  pA device know all its interfaces. An interface know all other interface it is connected to.p  pBut given an interface how do I know to what device it belongp  pIf Interface is aware of Device, they become tightly coupled. For what I learn so far it is not really good OO. An other way would be to browse all device to know if they have the Interface I am looking for. It seems really inefficient. I am sure I missed something obvious. Can anybody sees itp  pThanksp  pupdate   This can be seen as shapes and connections in a MS Visio file. the interface is really just a connector on a shape. The device is the shape. p

Negative 7430 pI have a fairly simple android app, it gets protobuf data from a web server and has a java class generated by protoc.p  pNow I have no need for any other data than this data in my app. So i thought I would simply use this data rather than wrapping it since this would just be a lot of extra work.p  pHowever sometimes i expand the tree with new data nested messages in proto file and then i need to be able to insert these in the current tree which is not allowed since the java class always returns unmodifiableList.p  pI am now thinking that i could get the list with reflection, thus modifiable. It does not seem like a great solution but it beats doing extra work for wrapping the class and all the stuff therein. So my actual question is, is this a big no no or would it be okay.p  pI read somewhere that even within google they argue if its smart having the protobuf objects as data structure or only as pure sendrecieve messages.p

Negative 7430 pIm displaying text and xml on a webpage through a servlet. The servlet just loads the HTMLXML to the page on load through calls in the getPost method.  Now that I have that working the way I want it to my next step is to replace the static display text with calls to the database so that it can display information dynamically.  My question isp  pWhat is the best way to do this. Im using JPA and entities for persistence but I have a choice of making direct calls to the persisted items or going through an DataEntity Access Object which I have created.  I followed a tutorial that used EAOs and Entities with EJBs as a way of teaching best practices. I dont see the value in doing this yet, however.  It seems overly complicated to go through 3 classes when I could just access the data directly. p  pSo is this the preferred method or should servlets access data directly or through EAOsp  pThanksp

Negative 7430 pI am writing an SQL Server schema comparison tool and I need to extract out the text expression of both default amp check constraints from tables from any database version 2000, 2005, 2008 and the forthcoming 2012 version.p  pI am using the SQL Server 2000 Northwind database as my source database and SQL Server 2008 as the target database.  When I encounter the code[CKBirthdate]code check constraint on the codeEmployeescode table it contains the text code[BirthDate] lt getdatecode.  When scripted out via TSQL and then run in SQL Server 2008 R2 it becomes code[BirthDate]ltgetdatecode and the spaces are stripped out.  p  pI have tried stripping out the spaces, which works great, but was after reading a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1206514asimplewaytogeneratesqlserversstandardformofanexpressionthisa I was shocked to see that SQL Server changes the expression so it no longer matches the original expression.p  pI am having a bit of difficulty in getting the strongnormalizedstrong text from the checkdefault constraint and I dont really understand why SQL Server performs this normalization rather than just leaving the original text intact  This normalization process is making it virtually impossible do an exact comparison.p  pI have tried the followingp  ul liCreating a temporary table with a single sqlvariant column, but this causes an exception to be thrown because the column name used in the check constraint expression does not exist in the temporary table.  I could parse the expression to extract the column names and create them dynamically, but this would cause a degradation in performance.li liUpdating the check constraint back into the text property and then performing a codeRefreshcode to get the text back out.

Negative 7430 pIm somewhat new to Entity Framework 4, and Ive got a particular scenario thats left me stumped. I have two basic entities codeCylindercode and codeLocationcode. There is a manytomany mapping table between the two. In other words, a Cylinder has a collection of Locations and a Location has a collection of Cylinders.p  pIm using integer Ids as the Pk for both Cylinder and Location.p  pThese entities are retrieved as two collections Cylinders and Locations from the same context and edited on the client. Editing codeCylinder.Location[0]code will change the corresponding Location in the Locations collection, i.e. its the same object.p  pNow, when it comes time to save on the server, my update method takes a list of Cylinders and a list of Locations. Saving the Cylinders and Locations independently is straight forward.p  pstrongUPDATEDstrongp  pMy initial approach is as followsp  pSave Locations...p  precodeforeach var cylinderLocation in cylinderLocations      if cylinderLocation.ChangeTracker.State  ObjectState.Added         cylinderLocation.Insert     else if cylinderLocation.IsDirty         cylinderLocation.Update  codepre  pCylinderLocation.Insert looks like thisp  precodepublic static void Insertthis CylinderLocation cylinderLocation      using var context  new CylinderManagementModelContainerGetConnectionString              if cylinderLocation.Cylinder  null             cylinderLocation.Cylinder.ModifiedTimeStamp  DateTime.Now          cylinderLocation.ModifiedTimeStamp  DateTime.Now          context.CylinderLocations.AddObjectcylinderLocation          context.SaveChanges        codepre  pstrongUPDATEstrong The CylinderLocation Insert saves the CylinderLocation and the Cylinder if one is mapped however, when the SaveCylinders step executes below, it still thinks there is a new Cylinder with an Id  0. In other words, cylinders[0].Id  0, but location[0].Cylinder[0].Id  0.p  pSave Cylinders...p  precodeforeach var cylinder in cylinders      if cylinder.ChangeTracker.State  ObjectState.Added         cylinder.Insert     else if cylinder.IsDirty         cylinder.Update  codepre  pBut things get confusing when I try to save a new Cylinder and a new Location and they both need to be mapped to each other. In other words, codeCylinder.Id  0code, codeLocation.Id  0code and they both need to be saved and mapped to each other.p  pI was hoping that I could update the Ids after the save takes place i.e. use property changed and update the original entities however, it seems that once the entities are serialized to the server, codeCylinder.Location[0]code is no longer the same object in the Locations collection, i.e. its a different instance. So the Id update doesnt work.p  pIm open to any suggestions.p  pThanks.p

Negative 7430 pI created this page a hrefhttpikwebdesigner.comspecialcharacters relnofollowhttpikwebdesigner.comspecialcharactersap  pWhen you click on the strongtopstrong navigation, it takes you to a place within the same page. I need the nav link to stay highlighted until I click another link in the strongtopstrong navigation. I already know about CSS strongfocusstrong. But the focus style will disappear when I click elsewhere. p  pIve searched this site and Google for the past few months and all Im getting is current link highlighting for external pages. I already know how to do that using PHP. What I dont know how to do is make active links that are on the same page stay highlighted once clicked.p  pI need something, possibly jQuery, that will add an strong.activestrong class so I can style it. And the link should stay that color until I click another link within that same group.p  pIve seen this done on a few sites, I open the code and try to duplicate it, but it doesnt work for me. I was wondering if there was someone you could help me with. p  pemBonus points if the highlightedactive link could change depending on the different section I was on would be an awesome plus as well. Ive seen this too.emp  pI use a lot of jQuery, so perhaps something in jQuery would be best. Thanks in advance. I, however, dont know jquery or javascript. I dont know how to write it. I usually just find someones codetutorial that works. In this case I havent be able to find something like this.p

Negative 7430 pFirefox 11 was pushed out the release channel this morning, and much to my chagrin one of the 3rd party libraries that I use in our Intranet specifically, Hookbox now triggers a Security Error in the console when it starts up.

It would be helpful if I could know what specifically the type or cause of the Security Error is, for example.p  pIm not really asking for help sorting out my specific issue, but I was hoping there was information available about Javascript Security Errors in Firefox in general.p

Negative 7430 pI have a database with a simple flyweight table referenced by another table. Lets call them, respectively, Category and Product.p  pThe Product table has several columns, one of which is a foreign key column complete with constraint to the CategoryID to a row of the Category table. Its simple, and I have many of them in this particular database. p  pI am using Linq in Visual Studio 2008 to represent this data in my application. Both tables appear as normal, and neither have anything special in their properties that would indicate the behaviour Ill describe.p  pIn the database itself, there are several Product rows which have codeCategoryID1code. There are two or three that have codeCategoryID2code. However, when the data is loaded into my application through Linq, iterating through codecontext.Productscode shows that the first three have codeCategoryID1code, codeCategoryID2code and codeCategoryID3code, and all the rest of the rows have codeCategoryIDNULLcode. This is not how it appears in the database. There are no other anomalies in this database.p  pHelpp  pedit Ive posted an answer below, but maybe the DevExpress guys can chime in Im happy its now working correctly but Im not happy that I still dont understand what went wrong.p

Negative 7430 pI have created a JPanel which contains an arbitrary number of JLabels, laid out with a leftaligned flow layout manager.

Negative 7430 pIm implementing a screenshot feature for Android 2.3 I know that ICS has a screenshot feature already. Im using the Android Screenshot Library ASL for short project as a base, and Im modifying it to suit my needs. I can also freely modify Androids source code for it. The goal is to have something like what the Galaxy Note does you take a screenshot with a key press combo and then an editor shows up which allows you to change the image however you like. You could take a screenshot anywhere on the main screen, while using apps, etc.p  pRight now I have 3 working parts a native binary that captures the screen buffer, a service that talks to the native binary and retrieves the screenshot, and the editor. But Im not sure how I could join the 3 things together. The native binary can be added to the Android prebuilt part and init.rc can be modified to execute it as root when booting I still have to do this though. The editor is a simple app that can be included in Android as well. But I still cant figure out what to do with the service.p  pIdeally Id like to capture a key press combo say power button and volume down, or maybe two of the front buttons, which would trigger the service. The service would then call the binary to take a screenshot and launch an intent to open the editor with the screenshot. However, as far as I know a service cannot catch key presses. Besides, the service has to be bound somewhere in order to know when it has to take a screenshot, so I guess that I should modify Android itself to start the service and bind to it at startup, but the documentation regarding Android source code is lacking and I have no clue where to start looking.p  pDoes anyone know what component of Android is in charge of the key presses, and where I should bind my service Is my approach even possible at allp  pThank you in advance for any possible help.p

Negative 7430 pIm writing a malloc function for a college assignment.  Heres a basic layout of my ideap  p1Define a node struct with pointers to previous node, next node, as well as a char for size and vacancy.  Each region in the heap will contain a hidden node with this information.p  p2Malloc function.  Starting with first node loop through each node checking for vacancy.  If a node is vacant and is large enough return a ptr to the beginning of the region not including the node. If no space is available use sbrk to allocate requested space PLUS space for a node. p  p3Free function. Go to pointer passed as parametersizeofstruct node and set the vacancy to vacant.  Then starting with the beginning of the list, traverse the list merging adjacent free spaces.p  pHow does this approach sound  My main concern is with actually starting the linked list.  For instance, should I create a node with sbrk before I start to do any allocations and store a ptr to it as a global variable If so how do I initialize a first node before I allow the malloc function to be called by a driver programp  pThanks in advance.  Im not asking for someone to write my code, only to provide some insight and suggestions regarding my ideas. p

Negative 7430 pI need a script that runs several times per day to build tables dozens of them in a new database and copy certain information from an old database, which I will call the prev database.p  pI want to copy the STRUCTURE of each of the tables from the prev database to the new database.  Thats easy to do thanks, google.  I also want to be able to have the same information indexed in the new table.  The indices are sometimes on columns and sometimes combinations of columns.  I can build these indices manually easily enough  even though theres a lot of them.  However, Im wondering if theres an SQL scripting way of telling SQL, Come on, man, look at the indices in that prev table and put the same ones in this here new table.p  precode rename underlying files of old db.

Negative 7430 pI have a page in my ASP.NET web application that is essentially a tool for generating adhoc reports. Users set values among a multitude of critera and then submit those to retrieve a result set. The SQL needed to get the result is generated at runtime in code I use the SQL to create a SqlDataSource and then tie that to a ListView. Up to that point everything is working just fine.p  pWhat I cant figureout is how to, then, dynamically generate the columns for the ListView. The problem lies in the fact that I dont know the numbernames of the columns at compiletime, since they are dependent upon the output of the dynamicallygenerated SQL. I assumed this would be a very simple little exercise, but I cannot seem to find a simplified example that illustrates how to do this.p  pMy existing code is almost irrelevant, since Im basically asking for groundup examples. Im not even sure if my approach is correcti.e., using a ListView in markup and trying to manipulate its template in code, at runtime.

Negative 7430 pIs there an easy way to filter out NonIntentional stories from the Facebook Graph API.  For instance, when I check a users feed I get tons of John Smith is now friends with xyz posts, which are not actually posted by a user.  p  pThe graph API used to not return these at all.  For older Facebook apps, there is a migration setting Include recent activity stories which suppressed these, but new apps dont get that migration option.  p  pIve resorted to a RegEx and checking for a storytags attribute, but I was hoping theres a cleaner way maybe a query flag to the feed endpointp  pThanksp  pNickp

Now were back on track.p  pIs there a way to get Facebook to present the auth screen after the user logs into a signed out Facebook account, and from there get them back into my app automaticallyp  pstrongCase 2 User presses Cancel on auth screenstrongp  pWhen the user presses Cancel on the auth screen, they are left in the Facebook app.  Only way back to our app is to fast app switch or tap our apps icon.  However, if they press the Login button on the auth screen, everything is fine. Theyre in our app, ready to post to Facebook. p  pProgrammatically on my end same things are happening as in Case 1.  p  pAnyway to handle that Cancel scenario differently, such that I can cancel the users post to Facebook, but theyre still in our appp  pstrongEDIT 1strong I uninstalled the Facebook app from my iPhone and tested.  Both scenarios work the way I want them to, when using Facebook via web browser. So this looks like a different behavior between the Facebook iOS app and the Facebook mobile web pageapp.p  pThanks in advancep  pDelp

Negative 7430 pI have looked through a ton of tutorials and suggestions on how to work with DropDownList in MVC.

However, Ill only answer requests for files that descend from a fixed codeparentcode directory.p  pThe first potential security problem that comes to mind is that an evil user may request paths with code..code embedded.  Another potential problem are symlinks, though these should not be an issue since I control the local filesystem and there wont be any simlinks under codeparentcode.p  pMy question is therefore whether it is enough to check for the existence of code..code among the path components.

Negative 7430 pIm trying to set up my own autoscaling system on AWS and Ive set up alarms for any instance spawned with a specific AMI ID.p  pWhen I check the the metrics which are only monitoring one server, they get information just fine.

Negative 7430 pHow can I do incremental deployment of my code to a large cluster in the cloud I mean if I have a cluster of say 300 nodes and I want that cluster to get updated with my latest build code but only on the files that are changed binary and data files, how can I go about it p  pI came across murder but it doesnt seem to do incremental file deployment and copies everything down to every node.  p  pI also looked at chef but that does not seem to be a good fit for incremental total code deployment too and it is more suitable to run your installer on every machine and make sure the installed code config files are up to date according to the chef server. It does not look like to bother with the version of the installed program. So I see chef have file control but maybe make sense to use it for a config file but not sure if it makes sense for a code project that has hundred of binaries and data files. p  pI can sure write my own system to do this but I am wondering if I have a better option for large cluster incremental deployment especially during the development phasep  pIn my case, the servers are windows and cloud is aws.p

Negative 7430 pSuppose I have a class Person with the following properties and methodsp  ul licodepublic string FirstNamecodeli licodepublic string LastNamecodeli licodepublic House CurrentHousecodeli licodepublic void BuildHousestring streetAddresscodeli ul  pHouse is a separate class with some simple properties like street address.p  pWhen I first create a codePersoncode object, I databind a WPF window to it.  Person starts out with a codeFirstNamecode and codeLastNamecode, but their codeCurrentHousecode is null.  This is a stupid example but for the sake of argument lets say the person has to build a house before they can live in it.  Databinding to codeFirstNamecode and codeLastNamecode works as expected.p  pNow lets say I want to move this person into a house.

I have a label that shows the persons address bound to codeMyPerson.CurrentHouse.StreetAddresscode with an codeUpdateSourceTriggercode of codePropertyChangedcode.  When I first show the screen the codeCurrentHousecode object is null and the label is blank expected behavior.  However when I call codeBuildHouse123 anywhere stcode, I expect the databound label to have its value changed to 123 anywhere st.p  pThis is not whats happening and Im starting to suspect its because when the window is initially open, the CurrentHouse property for the databound codePersoncode object  is null.  Are my suspicions correct  If so, what do I need to do to enable databinding on the label once the CurrentHouse object is no longer null p

Negative 7430 pIm a beginner in iOS development, so maybe its a dumb wish from my side. Nevertheless, the thing is Im making a Statistics section of my app, which should let user choose a certain month and year and he would get some statistics results for that period of time of different entries he entered before. The hard part is that I also would like to implement the whole year selection for months component, so user could choose, for example, All for month and 2013 for year and he would get statistics for the whole 2013 year. I was unable to find any examples like this on this site or in google at all, because in all cases DatePicker returns you the certain date, and not the range of the dates. So I came to conclusion, that maybe its not the way how you do such a task in iOS One of the options I thought about was to implement two date pickers, one for from and one for til, but it seems a bit tedious... Basically, I want user to be able to select certain month or a year to see the statistics for that period of time. Id appreciate if you could give me some advice how you usually proceed with tasks like this one in iOS. Thanks.p  pupdate Thanks everyone for the answersp

Negative 7430 pI have an application built in FlashBuilder written in actionscript that when I launch the application its very responsive and smooth running.  However, over time and after interacting with some sliders in the application the program slowly becomes more and more unresponsive and less smooth.

However, after the application has been running for a while when taking the same action of 0 to 100 and moving the slider at the same rate from 0 to 100 I might only get a handful of values instead of maybe 50.p  pDoes anyone know why this is happening and what I should check to reduce this leakage of performancep

Negative 7430 pi found some posts dealing with this topic, but our situation is a bit different, so I post it here, hoping someone can help us with it. The situation is We develop a rich client that is started via webstart loaded from a server. In the client we use spring 3.0.5 for dependency injection, nothing else so far. Since we had big trouble with slow component scans because of AOP in spring, we do not use all spring jars but the followingp  precodespringasm3.0.5.RELEASE.jar springbeans3.0.5.RELEASE.jar springcontext3.0.5.RELEASE.jar springcontextsupport3.0.5.RELEASE.jar springcore3.0.5.RELEASE.jar springexpression3.0.5.RELEASE.jar codepre  pThe effect we have is strange If we start the rich client via webstart it is quite fast component scan in a few seconds.  Now for some reason i try to start our client as regular application by just having all jars on my computer and starting the app with a huge classpath. In this scenario it takes 35 minutes depending on the computer to boot the app. In the log i can see its the spring component scan that takes so long. Of course the used jar files are 100 identical in both solutions. So my fundamental question is Where is the difference here I would have expected it all the way round. Long time in Webstart and fast as application. Does anyone have a hint what could cause those long startup times in the application scenariop

Negative 7430 pIve got an issue with my fieldset in Zend Framework 2. The user is able to save his personal data over a form. If he already save this, they should be prefilled with the data from database. This worked fine as it was only a form, but I need the address data in a fieldset, so that I can use it at other parts of my program. Now the input fields stays empty.p  pAt the beginning, I fill the personal data in a session. My data looks like thisp  precodeobjectApplicationModelProductPersonalData247 3       [telprotected]gt string0       [birthdayprotected]gt string10 20130101      [addressprotected]gt objectApplicationModelAccountAddresses248 15              [firstnameprotected]gt string5 Ernie          [surnameprotected]gt string6 Muppet             ...         codepre  pAs you can see, the data is already bind to the given objects, PersonalData as main, and Addresses for the fieldset. This seems to work then. Then I put it in my formp  precodeoFormgtsetDataoFormgtgetHydratorgtextractSESSIONgtgetPersonalData return new ViewModelarrayformgtoForm codepre  pThe addressFieldset has a hydrator and a binding, which does work, because all objects are perfectly filled. The only problem is, that when I open the page, the inputfields are empty, only birthday and telephone are filled, which are directly on the formp  pMy form implements the addressfieldset like thisp  precodeaddressFieldset  new AddressFieldsetlang addressFieldsetgtsetUseAsBaseFieldsettrue addressFieldsetgtsetNameaddress thisgtaddaddressFieldset codepre  pI think that it might be just a problem with the correct addressing of my fieldset, but I cant explain why it would be filled correctly after posting the data then. All I want is that he fill the setData in my Fieldset.p  pI hope you understand my question and could help me.br Thanks a lot,br Svenjap  pEDIT I analysed it a bit more now, its very strange and I dont know what went wrong. When I debug I can see that fieldsetgetValue returns all data I need. So I thought that the binding might be wrong and I did this to debug it step by stepp  precodevalues  thisgtformgtgetaddressgtgetValue addressFieldset  thisgtformgtgetaddress aValues  addressFieldsetgtgetHydratorgtextractvalues addressFieldsetgtbindValuesaValues codepre  pI went to the Fieldset.php and bindValues does perfectly what it should it is only a recapitulation anyway, call the hydrator and fill my object. But if I show in the elements, all values are NULL. I already checked my elements twice. The only different between the model and the elements is a different order of declaration. I call the method setUseAsBaseFieldtrue in the fieldset and the form, too. I cant understand why the data is in values but not in elements.p

So it can not be device realated issue. The results can be seen here a hrefhttpimageshack.usphotomyimages1678ac.png relnofollowTest resultsap  pMy conclusion after testing was, that netsnmp seems to cache the selected auth and priv protocol for one user name.

Negative 7430 pI am using dynamic keyword to work with an outside assembly and it works fine as far as accessing its methods and primitive type members are concerned.

Negative 7430 pI want to adjust the machine keys dynamically in code during runtime, for an IIS hosted ASP.NET MVC 4 website.p  pThe machine keys, encryption and validation keys as well as algorithms to use, are stored in a database. Instead of reading the values from the codeweb.configcode file, I want to inject those values during application startup and let the system use those instead.p  pIs there any way to accomplish that without having to change codeweb.configcode at all to only change the in memory configurationp  pI have tried accessing the configuration section but it is marked as readonly and is also sealed, so I cannot override codeIsReadOnlycode. However, there is a codesettercode that is an indicator, to me, that there may be a way to potentially remove the readonly flag.p  precodevar configSection  MachineKeySectionConfigurationManager.GetSectionsystem.webmachineKey if configSection.IsReadOnly         configSection.ValidationKey  platformInfo.MachineKey.ValidationKey        configSection.DecryptionKey  platformInfo.MachineKey.EncryptionKey        ...  codepre  pIs there any way to accomplish this  The only alternative I can see is to use a custom method like AppHarbor, however I would rather stick with the built in approach if it is possible at all.p  pIn case someone asks why I want to do that, the reason is, this is for a large number of identical websites running in a webfarm. Hence, having nonautogenerated keys is a must must be the same on each server. Also each website should be isolated and should not share the same keys. As all websites are identical in their physical representation, they share the same physical location. That is the reason the web.config file cannot contain application specific settings.p  pEdit It would be very helpful to confirm, at least, if it is simply not possible. As said, one can use custom authentication and encryption methods which would avoid using the machine key settings altogether. Thanks.p

Negative 7430 pI have this question thats been bothering me for a while now. At first glance it might seem like a fairly basic question, but there doesnt seem to be a clear answer. My basis for asking this question is a Python project that uses PostgreSQL through SQLAlchemy, but the specific language and tools used dont really matter.p  pThe basic question is where to put logic when using an ORM More concretely, what logic should go into methods of my mapping classesp  pThere seem to be some clearcut cases, for instance, basic validation of properties, such as minimum length or whether or not something is an email address should belong in the ORM layer or even in the database itself.p  pA simple concrete example is in order, so lets assume we are storing User objects, Users have an  emailaddress which is their unique id, a password and an activation id. When an account is created an activation id is assigned and mailed to the user, which she then uses to set a password.p  pLets look at a couple of scenariosp  ul liUser creates an accountli liUser activates account i.e. sets a password.li ul  pSo when the user creates the account we need to run some basic validation   Email address correct  ORM   Email address unique  ORM or Database unique constraint   Set a random activation id  ORMp  pWhen the user activates her account I run into problems. I would want to validate the supplied password e.g. long enough Enough digits, but the model should stores the password using some sort of hashing or encryption algorithm. There seem to be two optionsp  p1 Check activation id, and password validity outside of the model, hash the password then set the User.password to the hash, and User.activation id to null to signal an active account.p  p2 Create a User.activateactivationid, password method that validates everyting and sets the User.password and User.activationid properties accordingly.p  p3 Hybrid option, do option 1, but have some sort of hook or event set the activationid  null when the password gets set, if we assume either activation id or password can be set, then this hook satisfies a basic consistency property of the model.p  pIve searched on the internet and there are some sources that talk about this problem including some SO questions, but none really answer the question.p
Negative 7430 pIn the past Ive dealt with optional search criteria by dynamically adding filters to a Linq query like thisp  pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecodepublic IEnumerableltCustomergt FindCustomersstring name      IEnumerableltCustomergt customers  GetCustomers     var results  customers.AsQueryable     if name  null              results  results.Wherecustomer gt customer.Name  name          results  results.OrderBycustomer gt customer.Name     return results  codepre  por similarly using predicates, where you basically just move the lambda from the Where into a codeFuncltgtcode codeor ExpressionltFuncltgtgtcode if using LinqToEntities, like thisp  pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecodepublic IEnumerableltCustomergt FindCustomersstring name      FuncltCustomer, boolgt searchPredicate  customer gt true     if name  null              searchPredicate  customer gt customer.Name  name           IEnumerableltCustomergt customers  GetCustomers     var results  customers         .WheresearchPredicate         .OrderBycustomer gt customer.Name     return results  codepre  pHowever I cant figure out how to do something similar when the Where clause is buried somewhere in a nested subquery.

Negative 7430 pThis question is specific to strongNativestrong mobile applications e.g. IOS, Android, WP apps that are not actually using a browser to access a web site.p  pWe have an existing ecommerce website that takes payment for most of the major credit cards, and it also performs payer authentication via the stronga hrefhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwiki3DSecure3DSecureastrong program implemented as strongVerified by Visastrong and strongMasterCard SecureCodestrong. This helps negate fraud and reduce chargebacks.p  pemThe existing implementation is such that during checkout and payment stage, it involves redirecting the customer away from your website, to a bank  card issuer website where the customer can enter their previously setup password to authenticate that they are indeed the card holder. The website will then redirect the customer back to your website with information needed to complete the transaction. There is quite a bit more to it, but thats the basic premise of it.emp  pSo were working to create a strongnativestrong app for IOS initially that is not just the user browsing with Safari to the website, but an ObjectiveC implementation that gives a native experience that is rich and task focussed UI and easy for the user to operate.p  pWhat we cannot do is open n browser window from the native app for the user to be redirected somewhere, for authentication, and then redirected back. The reasons for this arep  ul liThis is a native app, not a web site, so there is nowhere URL to redirect back to.li liThe user experience is terrible switching from a clean UI to a squinty and differently styled web form on another website, and then back.li ul  pHas anyone had to try and implement strong3D Securestrong VbV  SecureCode using a Native app emWPIOSAndriodem Can it be done Did you take a different approachp  pThanks for readingp

Negative 7430 pI am trying to make an autonomous State machine. Below is pretty much the code I have.

However, the dia2dump only cocreates the dia80.dll at run time .... and even if I unregister it, but leave dia90 registered  dia2dump will then complain it cant find the dll at all.  CoCreateInstance failed  HRESULT  80040154 p  pIm not sure if this is because I am on a 32 bit machine, or because I am compiling under VS2008... or I registered the wrong dia90.dll somehow... or what  How do I figure it outp  pThis is what Ive tried so farp  pI modified dia2dump.cpp to load the dll based on a the uuid of a forward reference to the class DiaSource I hoped that the uuid would be able to find the active version of the class in the registry and supply the correct number, but VS2008 apparently doesnt work that way  it computes the uuidof in some other fashion ... because even with diaguid.Lib deleted, and CLSIDDiaSource becoming undefined I verified it cant find it. using uuidofDiaSource still caused it to find the CLSID for msdia80.dll  not 90.p  precodetypedef class DiaSource hr  CoCreateInstanceuuidofDiaSource,CLSIDDiaSource,                          NULL,                          CLSCTXINPROCSERVER,                         uuidofIDiaDataSource,                         void  ppSource codepre  pSo, why is this not also linking to the CLSID for msdia90.dll  I dont have the diaguid.Lib for version 90  just the dll.  But I do know, in the registry that there are two uuids  CLSIDs  one for each version of the dll.p  pHKEYCLASSESROOTCLSID4C41678E887B4365A09E925D28DB33C2  msdia90.dll  HKEYCLASSESROOTCLSIDBCE364342C24499EBF498BD99B0EEB68  msdia80.dllp  pAlthough, in the latest MSDN page at this time 2013, the name of the variable is still CLSIDDiaSource , suggesting the class is named the same in the new dll... So I dont know why there are two different CLSIDs for the dlls... a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryhd8h6f4628vvs.12029.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryhd8h6f4628vvs.12029.aspxap  pEDIT I got it to link CoCreate, I think, by doing this trick as a workaround, but the original error still happens when I run it with version 90  so my guess was wrong...p  precodeclass declspecuuid4C41678E887B4365A09E925D28DB33C2 msdia90  hr  CoCreateInstanceuuidof msdia90 ,  codepre  pSo, Im totally lost.

Negative 7430 pIve stumbled across a problem that Im having trouble figuring out a solution to.

Negative 7430 pIm trying to use codeSystem.Reflectioncode to get the same result for a property as with using the codemetadatacode, specifically the codeIsComplexTypecode property. The problem that Im facing is that I couldnt find the logic that MVC Framework uses to determine if a property is complex or not.

Negative 7430 pI have a model Team with one property TeamMembers which is a list of the class TeamMember. TeamMember itself right now only has the Id and Name Properties for testing.p  pI created the CRUD Views automaticall and can enter the normal properties of Team Id, TeamName, Location, etc. just fine, but of course the View doesnt know what to do with List, so just for testing purposes I hardcoded this into the create methodp  precodevar TeamMembers  new ListltTeamMembergt TeamMembers.Addnew TeamMembers  Name  Bob  Team.TeamMembers  TeamMembers codepre  pThis seems to work. When I create the new Team, and set a breakpoint right at the end of the Create method, I can see the entry in the inspectorhover. Also a table TeamMember I save the model in a local DB is created in the DB with and entry for bob, including a TeamId referencing the Team I just created.p  pNow when I try to output the Details for a Team, TeamMembers returns null. No error, nothing, just null. Shouldnt it return something anything An Object, a Reference,...p  pThe goal is to create a Team and have TeamMembers contain a whole bunch of TeamMember entries that I can later iterate through and output them in a list, etc.p  pCan anybody tell me where my mistake lies Is there a concept I didnt grasp, or some stupid oversightp  pThank you for your time.p

Negative 7430 pIve somewhat recently made the switch to SASS for writing my CSS. I build sites in Wordpress. Ive developed a CSSwriting method that I thought was a smart way to organize CSS by specific Wordpress page. My method isp  p1 through some php magic, I give every new Wordpress page a unique class all the way up in the body tag. So if my site has 4 pages, the body tag on each page has a unique class as so      , , etc...p  pI thought this would give me a great shortcut for styling CSS elements that appear on multiple pages but that I need styled a bit differently on each page. For example, lets say I have this markup on all 4 pages of my sitep  precodeltsection classmodulegt     ltdiv classpricegt         ltdiv classceneteredgt             ltpgtsome text ltspangttextltspangtltpgt         ltdivgt     ltdivgt ltsectiongt codepre  pBUT, I need that span inside the p tag to be styled differently on page 4. Easy, I thought. I my SASS, I would just use my unique page body class and do thisp  precode.page1, .page2, .page3       .module          colorred          .price              colorblue              .centered                  colorgreen                  p span coloryellow                                  .page4       .module          colorblack          .price              colorblack              .centered                  colorblack                  p span colorblack                                 codepre  pSo the first SASS block is for my first 3 pages, and the second block is for my 4th page. It styles everything exactly how I want it, and make organizational sense to me to basically mimic my html nesting with my SASS nesting. Of course, since Im so specific with my SASS nesting, if I want to override a CSS rule further down my SASS page, I need to be just as specific with my nesting or use the important rule, which I like to avoid.p  pI thought everything was fine with this method  looked great in all my browsers, until I looked on IE9. I noticed in IE9 developer tools that my CSS file was just stopping halfway down and half of my rules werent even being loaded. I inspected more and I noticed my SASS method was outputting a HUGE number of selectorsrules for each element Im trying to style.p  pThe above example for that span tag within the .page1, .page2, .page3 nesting alone is outputting dozens of rules. I sort of realized this would happen, but I didnt think it was problematic since my CSS was 100 valid.p  pSo my questions arep  ol lipIs this just a terrible method of writing CSS Do I need to rewrite everything to eliminate so much nestingpli lipWhy does IE9 and under just stop reading my CSS if it comes to a CSS rule with too many selectors pli ol  pIve used various selector counter tools and according to them, my CSS sheet is well under the limit that IE9 imposes they tell me my stylesheet has 1744 selectors.p  pHere is my sheet a hrefhttpwallstreetprep2.comwpcontentthemeswallstreetprepstyle.css relnofollowhttpwallstreetprep2.comwpcontentthemeswallstreetprepstyle.cssap  pIm fearing I need to just rewrite my SASS and get rid of nesting up to the body tag level p

Negative 7430 pI have this question related to memory barriers.p  pIn a multithreaded applications a memory barrier must be used if data is shared between them , because a write in a thread that is runing on one core , may not be seen by another thread on an another core. p  pFrom what I read from other explanations of memory barriers, it was said that if you have a single thread working with some data you dont need a memory barrier.p  pAnd here is my question it could be the case that a thread modifies some data on a specific core, and then after some time the scheduler decides to migrate that thread to another core.p  pIs it possible that this thread will not see its modifications done on the other corep

Negative 7430 pIm using Python to extract data using Steams API.  I have a randomly generated list of Steam IDs.  The problem is, not all of these IDs point to valid accounts.  When I try to access the account for which there is no object value, the program gives me a KeyError.  The Steam API will output a [response] level object for any requests, so when i print using that topmost level, I will get a response for every request.  However, if I go one more level in e.g. [response][gamecount], the program will fail when it gets to an account which does not have any [gamecount] value.  How do I tell python to just skip these accountsp  pExample outputp  paccount with game Removed extra returns for readabilityp  precode response      gamecount 1,     games [                      appid 205790,             playtimeforever 0              ]  codepre  paccount without gamep  precode     response        codepre  pMy current codep  precodeimport urllib2, random, sys, json  list  opendpythonSteamUserIDs.txt.read.splitlines SteamID  strlist   for SteamID in list[0101]     request  urllib2.Requesthttpapi.steampowered.comIPlayerServiceGetOwnedGamesv0001key05475AE5A8410CE01236A8A29E1DEE8Eampsteamidsampformatjson SteamID, headersUserAgent Mozilla5.0 Windows NT 6.2 Win64 x64 AppleWebKit537.36 KHTML, like Gecko Chrome32.0.1667.0 Safari537.36     response  json.loadurllib2.urlopenrequest     request2  urllib2.Requesthttpapi.steampowered.comISteamUserGetPlayerSummariesv0001key05475AE5A8410CE01236A8A29E1DEE8Eampsteamidssampformatjson SteamID, headersUserAgent Mozilla5.0 Windows NT 6.2 Win64 x64 AppleWebKit537.36 KHTML, like Gecko Chrome32.0.1667.0 Safari537.36     response2  json.loadurllib2.urlopenrequest2 codepre

Negative 7430 pIn my app user will have a list of items, each item will have a thumbnail,the thumbnails are downloaded from the net, so i want to save the images in the app directory, so that the app wont download thumbnails every time, now i am saving images in codeNSLibraryDirectorycode, and there are many directories available like codeNSDocumentDirectory,NSApplicationSupportDirectory..code those images will be downloaded if they are not present in the NSLibraryDirectory.My question is which directory is the correct place to save these thumbnail images so the user need not download the images every time. Previously i used codeNSDocumentLibrarycode but i have read that those will be backed up by iCloud and apple could reject the app for that. So, i have changed to codeNSLibraryDirectorycode and everything is working fine. Is it okay to do so. Any better way to store images like that.Thank youp

Negative 7430 pOkay, so I may need some perspective here.  Someone recently asked for a responsive web design for their site, but also want it to be supported in IE8.  p  pMy immediate reaction was No.  In all honesty, I pretty much just jumped to it not being possible, but Ive since learned that, with alot of spackle, you can make it work.  The Guardian has a good post on a hrefhttpwww.theguardian.cominfodeveloperblog2013oct14mobilefirstresponsiveie8 relnofollowthisa.  Even after learning this, I still have the same gut reaction of no.  I probably should be inspired by the attitude of the folks at The Guardian, but Im not.  p  pIt seems to me that there are more headaches that will await me beyond just the multiple stylesheets and checks for browser type, as typically, when someone wants this type of backwards compatability, they want the experience to still be identical. p  pAm I just way off base here  What are some of the tangible items found in HTML 5 and a typical responsive web design that would clearly be lost or very very difficult to shim for IE8  Maybe I just need an attitude adjustmentp

In fact this is a simplified version of the entire java application that Im building. A number of clients send their public keys to the server at regular intervals. The server listens at a port. It receives the public keys, gets the ip addresses and puts them in a ConcurrentHashMap. The ConcurrentHashMap is then sent back to the clients. In this way the clients will know who is online. In this simplified version the server gets the public key and ip of one client and sends back the ConcurrentHashMap with the clients public key and ip only.p

As i need this control to integrate in winform application.p  p2 How do i go in designing and programming such control. I mean can someone provide a class diagram or flow chart for this. How do i place the events in correct positions.p  p3 how do i get the data stored in the database in this control as it is being read and written from the winform application.p  p4 And if possible can someone tell me what contols and logic should i use for the particular parts of this control.p

Negative 7430 pWhat should i write as a custom expression when setting the States Measurement Unit for an indicator. Usually you have just Percentage and Numeric. I have two fields F1 and F2 in the report and i want an indicator that goes from ColorA to ColorE through colors BCD when the RATIO F1F2 between the two fields goes from the minimum to the maximum of the values in my tablix. For instance, if the F1F2 minimum values in the data i load is 5 and the maximum is 15, therefore when the ration F1F2 is 10 then the indicator should appear somehow of colorC the middle one. I can do this when i have just one field using percentage but i cant manage to do the same if the value is given with a formula.p

Negative 7430 pSo Im doing a simple board game in unity. My process is that when I press a button, the program will generate a random number from 19 and my character will change position from his initial position to the next position depending on what is the resulted number.p  pMy process works fine. My character moves the way it should, but I have a small problem in my touch input. When I press my button, it will generate a number and show it in a GUIText for JUST A MILLISECOND and then it will change back again to 0 when I let go of my button. I think my problem is that the resulted number only appears in the GUIText when I hold the button and comes back to 0 when I let go. And that is not only the problem the other problem is that when I hold my button longer it keeps on generating and accepting numbers so it totally messes up my process. My question is how can I prevent my button from processing after just ONE click and how can I show the resulted number in my GUIText after the click. Ive experimented on my if statement changing it to different Touch Phase properties but still I cant get it right.

Than I blur this screenshot with CSS Webkit Filter. Last thing to do I tracked the scrolling from the side and set it equal to the blurred Screenshot, so it scrolls with the site and everything behind the Navbar looks like actual side blurred. p  pNow my issue, when I click on one of the Menu Items the site begins to scroll. It works perfectly but as soon the site scrolls and changes height, with the blurred Canvas inside the scroll animation is very choppy and it lags like hell. p  pIn Chrome everything works perfectly fine, but on Safari its lagging. So I started searching for the failure. I think the issue is the scroll animation and the height animation running simultan when something is actually inside the div. I think another problem is that I used overflow hidden in CSS.

Negative 7430 pJust to be clear I dont need or want two entities that are the same.p  pI have an entity in my model which has relationships with several other entities throughout the model.  Its getting a bit messy in the graphical editor style and I think I recall that there iswas a way to have multiple copies of an entity in the editor all of which are just a graphic representation of the same, underlying, entityp  pI cant figure out how to do it, however, so before I drive myself nuts trying to figure out how can anyone tell me if this can be donep  pI would just carry on experimenting but I know how flakey the model editor used to be and I really dont want to screw it up.p  pThanksp
Negative 7430 pI use Drupal 7 and would prefer to do so but if I need to use Drupal 6 I will.  I have a Drupal 7 site that I allow advisors to create authenticated users. I am an admin on the site so I see and can do everything. All that an advisor can do is create and edit authenticated users. Is there a way to make a view that displays the users that the particular advisor has created while the advisor is logged inp  pIf you dont understand what Im saying let me put it this way. I am the admin of the site so I can do everything. I created a user role called advisor. Theres also an authenticated role for users. Advisors can create authenticated users. So I have Advisor 1. Advisor 1 created 10 users. I also have Advisor 2. Advisor 2 created 3 users. Id like a page more than likely built with views  and Ive used views before on other sites so Im familiar with them  Id like a page that Advisor 1 could go to once logged in and it would display all of the 10 users that they created. Advisor 1 wouldnt see the users that Advisor 2 create.p  pIs this possible Any help on this would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance.p

Negative 7430 pSo Im running into a bit of a wall here. I have a main.c program that plays around with linked lists, and at some points passes in a value of a node thats to be deleted from the list. The kicker was that it was supposed to do it using call by reference. Im fairly certain like...85 that Ive got all the things I need for the remove node function, but Im probably just not implementing it right.p  pSo this is the initializing function that all the others in my List.c file derive fromp  precode Call by reference  This is a linked list without dummy head node void initList alist, int fCompvoid , void , void fPrintvoid , void fFreevoid       ifalist  NULL              alistgthead  NULL         alistgttail  NULL         alistgtsize  0         alistgtcmpData  fComp         alistgtprintData  fPrint         alistgtfreeData  fFree          else              printfInvalid NULL list pointer passed inn       codepre  pThis is my removeNode functionp  precodeint removeNodeList alist, void obj Node cur, prev  alistgthead, start  alist.head void temp  obj  iftemp  cur      alistgthead  curgtnext     freecur     return 1   else ifobj  alistgthead      for cur  startgtnext cur  NULL cur  curgtnext          if alistgtcmpDatacurgtdata, temp  0              prevgtnext  curgtnext             freecur             return 1           end if         prev  cur       end for   end else if  return 0   end removeNode codepre  pList alist and void obj are the linked list elements and the element to be deleted, respectively that are passed in from main.c. The function is supposed to use cmpData which needs to be passed two void pointers from the init function to compare the current element being looked at with the element to be deleted then either return 1 if it does delete it or 0 if it doesnt.p  pThank you in advanced for any and all helpp  pstrongemUPDATEemstrong So my code posting is now the one that Ive got to work. It deletes the node as it is supposed to. HOWEVER, do I have enough free in it I have a memory leak checking program and it keeps telling me that I need two more frees in here, and it seems to specifically be the removeNode function since nowhere else in my program gets flagged.p

I can upload files for instance using Tiny MCE but only limited file types. This is why I am using an HTML file containing the JS code and not a JS file. p  pI have no direct control over the layout or template used for the page. p  pI can create custom CSS and JavaScript scripts but I have no control over the sequence of when these are loaded i.e. I cant position them on the page. p  pJQuery is installed by default so I do have access to some features Im not entirely sure which version. p  pAny suggestions of a more reliable way to load this code given these limitations would be welcome...p

Negative 7430 pLast year, I deployed a project in client server by encoding all the files using Zend Guard Loader PHP extension and after the deployment we have done some quick changes  fixes as per the client emails and deployed the files without encoding on live server as a matter of urgency which we have done so many times after the deployment so now I am on a stage that I dont have a list of files which deployed without encoding on live server.p  pNow Client is coming this year for upgrading the solution by further integrating new modules which require major impact on the current solution. So before moving ahead with the new modules integration i would like to generate one report that what are the files currently deployed on live server without encoded.p  pNow coming to the technical discussion, I have searched in Google and came to one solution that we can able to check whether the file is encoded or not using the Zend Guard Loader  PHP API. a hrefhttpfiles.zend.comhelpZendServer5zendguardloaderphpapi.htm relnofollowhttpfiles.zend.comhelpZendServer5zendguardloaderphpapi.htmap  pAPI provide one function strongboolean zendloaderfileencoded voidstrong but actually this function doesnt accept any argument as it always checks the current file whether the current file is encrypted or not using Zend guard.p  pBasically I would like to go through each folder and further files inside it on the server for checking whether its encoded or not.p  pLooking forward for your further direction path.p

Negative 7430 pSo I am trying to create a project with two canvas elements, each with its own paperscript, and with buttons on the outside of each that control certain functions within both.p  pUnder the documentation under Paperscript, it saysp  blockquote   pPlease note   When including more than one PaperScript in a page, each script will run in its own scope and will not see the objects and functions declared in the others. For PaperScript to communicate with other PaperScript or JavaScript code, see the tutorial about PaperScript Interoperability.p blockquote  p... which is unfortunate because that tutorial reads as followsp  blockquote   pComing very soonp blockquote  pIve gotten stuck very quickly in this process. Ive tried putting functions in global scope, calling them from outside their canvas, and seeing them print on the wrong canvas.  Ive tried exporting functions via a module and it seems to run the function .  And worst, the paper.projects object is an array with one project in it, the first canvas.p  pSo Im stumped.p  pAnyone know how to do thisp  pEDIT So apparently there is a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions24439046paperjsinteroperabilitythis answera but I dont see how that gets me being able to call functions in the PaperScript scope from global scope scripts.  p  pThat just seems like a script to call global functions in the PaperScope, which doesnt work for me if Im trying to make outside buttons do things.p  pClearly Im missing something.p  pSECOND EDIT I have played around with various global functions, either in window.global or just sitting by themselves with no var declaration... but what seems to happen is that when I try to call a function which I have defined, say asp  precodeglobals.makecircle  function       var o  new Path.Circle         radius 50,         center new Point 200,200       codepre  pin the main scope, it will just as soon run in the wrong window as the correct window.  Also there is an incredible delay before it runs which I cant figure out.p  pTHIRD EDIT For clarity.p  pI have codefirstcanvas.jscode attached to codecanvas1code in my HTML, I have codesecondcanvas.jscode attached to codecanvas2code. Both are referenced as paperscript type, asp  precodeltscript typetextpaperscript srcscriptsfirstcanvas.js canvascanvas1gtltscriptgt         ltscript typetextpaperscript srcscriptssecondcanvas.js canvascanvas2gtltscriptgt codepre  pI create codewindow.globalscode object as Jurg suggests. I call it from main.js with a button, such asp  precodewindow.globals   document.readydfs.onclick, window.globals.makecircle codepre  pI add this function to globals in codefirstcanvas.jscode as above.p  pIf I have most recently clicked on canvas2, clicking on the button with codeidDFScode will cause the function to run, extremely delayed, on canvas2.p  pAnd codepaper.projectscode does not list both projects, so I cant use the codeactivatecode functions.p

Negative 7430 h2This is not a factorial only problemh2  pIf I have 5 items and I wanted to know how many possible ways they could be arranged, the answer is 5 or 120. However my situation is I need to know how many possible ways 5 items could be arranged while the list still meets a certain condition.p  pIf I told you to make a list of heights based off of the requirement code2,2,5code where the first two numbers are how many heights you can see looking down the left and right of the list respectively, and the third is how many total items there are you may come up with something that looks like thisp  precode               X                X            X   X            X   X   X 2 gt    X   X X X          lt 2            X X X X X            X X X X X            A B C D E codepre  pFrom the absolute left looking down the list I would only be able to see two of the heights and the same is true from the right, and since there are five items, it is one possible face of the condition code2,2,5code.p  pMy problem is figuring out how many ways you could arrange this while keeping the code2code from the left and code2code from the right part, in tact.p  pObviously the arrangement codeABCDEcode works. You could even have some of the followingp  precodeADCBE ABDCE ADBCE ACBDE ACDBE codepre  pSo figuring out how many different ways there are while keeping the two ends in tact isnt too hard it would just be code3code I believe. However it gets interesting when you change up the sides. For example these combinations would workp  pAEBCD ABECDp  pAnd this is because we are assuming in this particular situation C is the tallest and can cover up all of the ones to the left of it so putting a short one to the right of it would still maintain visibility of code2code from both sides so long as the third highest one is in between the farthest left, and the highest one.p  pWith this rhetoric implemented, it makes sense to stress that the only information an algorithm or formula can get is simply code2,2,5code so you cannot put a face on the heights but you do you know there has to be a tallest and a second tallest and so on because they are all unique heights, which is where I came up for the basic posterchild arrangement of my ABCDE.p  pI am looking for basically any way to find this number in base 10. My thoughts are that based off of the code2,2,5code we can create some function that tells us how many variations there cannot be, and we can subtract this from codeNcode, or code5code.p  h2Edith2  pThings we can guarantee ourselves.p  ul liAll heights are uniqueli liThe second highest value has to appear on one of the sides.li liThe highest value can never appear on any absolute sidesli liMoreli ul

Negative 7430 pmaybe another one stumbled upon this topic and found a nice solution. Using the HATEOAS REST approach with help of Spring HATEOAS project works pretty well for link building to resources. But in the end, to map flattened resources back to an entity object tree, I need to disassemble my link and query the persistence backend. Example given, I have an entity Item, referencing ItemType Manytoone. Natural key of item is the composite of ItemType foreign key and Item code itself. The URL I map in ItemController using the link builder is p  precodeRequestMappingcatalogitemsitemTypeCodeitemCode codepre  pNow a unique link for an item is e.g. a hrefhttpwww.sample.comcatalogitemspabc123 relnofollowhttpwww.sample.comcatalogitemspabc123ap  pTo invert this link I do some very ugly string workp  precodeOverride public Item fromLinkLink link      Assert.notNulllink     String baseLink  linkToColorTypeController.class.toString       String itemTypeAndItemPart  link.getHref.replacebaseLink,      int indexOfSplit  itemTypeAndItemPart.indexOf     ItemType itemType  new ItemType     itemType.setCodeitemTypeAndItemPart.substring0, indexOfSplit     Item item  new Item     item.setItemTypeitemType     item.setCodeitemTypeAndItemPart.substringindexOfSplit  1     return item  codepre  pAnd all the time I am wondering, If there isnt a much nicer and more flexible approach beware of any query string part, that will break the code to do this inverse mapping. I actually do not want to call another MVC controller from within a controller but it would be nice, to somehow utilize the dispatcher servlet disassembly functions to deconstruct the URL into something more handy to work with. Any helpful hints for me Thx alot p

But when I try to render the texture bound to the framebuffer, the texture only shows black, where it actually should be red, right p  pAlso, the codeglCheckFramebufferStatuscode returns codeGLFRAMEBUFFERCOMPLETEcode so I suppose that the error lies within the rendering part, rather than the initialization phase. But Ill show the initialization code anyways.p  pThe initialization codep  precodepublic RenderableTexture initializeint width, int height, int internalFormat, int[] attachments, boolean useDepthBuffer      ifGLContext.getCapabilities.GLEXTframebufferobject          System.err.printlnFrameBuffers not supported on your graphics card           this.width  width     this.height  height     hasDepthBuffer  useDepthBuffer      fbo  glGenFramebuffers     glBindFramebufferGLFRAMEBUFFER, fbo      id  glGenTextures     glBindTextureGLTEXTURE2D, id      glTexParameteriGLTEXTURE2D, GLTEXTUREMINFILTER, GLNEAREST     glTexParameteriGLTEXTURE2D, GLTEXTUREMAGFILTER, GLNEAREST      glTexParameteriGLTEXTURE2D, GLTEXTUREWRAPS, GLCLAMP     glTexParameteriGLTEXTURE2D, GLTEXTUREWRAPT, GLCLAMP      glTexImage2DGLTEXTURE2D, 0, internalFormat, width, height, 0, GLRGBA, GLUNSIGNEDBYTE, ByteBuffer null       ifuseDepthBuffer          rbo  glGenRenderbuffers         glBindRenderbufferGLRENDERBUFFER, rbo         glRenderbufferStorageGLRENDERBUFFER, GLDEPTHCOMPONENT24, width, height         glFramebufferRenderbufferGLFRAMEBUFFER, GLDEPTHATTACHMENT, GLRENDERBUFFER, rbo           glFramebufferTexture2DGLFRAMEBUFFER, attachments[0], GLTEXTURE2D, id, 0      int[] drawBuffers  new int[attachments.length]      forint i  0 i lt attachments.length i         ifattachments[i]  GLDEPTHATTACHMENT             drawBuffers[i]  GLNONE         else             drawBuffers[i]  attachments[i]      glDrawBuffersUtil.toIntBufferdrawBuffers      ifglCheckFramebufferStatusGLFRAMEBUFFER  GLFRAMEBUFFERCOMPLETE         System.err.printlnWarning Incomplete Framebuffer     glBindFramebufferGLFRAMEBUFFER, 0      return this  codepre  pcodeinternalFormatcode has the value of codeGLRGBA8code and codewidthcode and codeheightcode have the value of 512 and 512. codeattachments[]code only contains 1 value and thats codeGLCOLORATTACHMENT0code. codeuseDepthBuffercode is set to codetruecode.p  pThe code above is only called once.p  pThis is the rendering codep  precodepublic RenderManager draw      glClearColorbg.x, bg.y, bg.z, bg.w     glClearGLCOLORBUFFERBIT  GLDEPTHBUFFERBIT      texture.bindAsRenderTargettrue     texture.releaseRenderTarget     quad.draw      return this  codepre  pI set the clear color to black code0, 0, 0, 1code and then clear the screen.

Negative 7430 pI was working on a little program I had to make some time ago, and I wanted to short it up.p  pThis little program was about one thread creating several child who would redirect their standard outputinput one to another with pipes in order, except for the last child, who wont redirect its standard output, like this.p  precodeParent pipe  child1   pipe   child2  pipe   last child                                   OOOO gt Stdout codepre  pFirst time I face this code, I made a matrix with a dimension of [nchild][2], and made a pipe from every position of that matrix, so it was very easy to connect every pipe to every child when needed. But now I want to try it only with 2 pipes, and playing with inheritance.p  pMaybe Im not explaining myself really well, so I think everything would be better understood with my code,so here we go. p  pre classlangc prettyprintoverridecodepipingfunctionint numberofchild      int i     int olddesc[2]     int newdesc[2] Here I create the descriptors of the pipes Ill use     int olddir     int newdir     ifpipeolddesclt0  pipenewdesc lt 0  I create the pipes         Error           olddir  olddesc     newdir  newdesc And attach the directions to the arrays direction we will see later why     fori  0 i lt numberofchild i         chaddr[i]  fork         switchchaddr[i]             case 1                 Error trace             case 0                 dup2olddesc[0],0 Here I redirect the pipe who connect the previous childs pipe to the standard input                 ifi  numberofchild  1                     dup2newdesc[1],1 And here, except from the last child, I redirect the standard output to the pipe who will connect to the standard input of the next child                 closeolddesc[0]                 closenewdesc[1] I close the descriptors I dont need                 Several child operations with standard inputoutput end up returning 01 after the pipeline is connected, so no child will create any child             default                 ifi  0                     dup2olddesc[1], 1 I want the standard output of the principal proccess only on the first pipe                 olddir  newdir Here I would want the direction of the old pipe to be the direction of the new pipe, in order to achieve the pipeline                 ifpipenewdesclt0                     Error                 break         End of switch     End of for     closeolddesc[0]closeolddesc[1]closenewdesc[0]closenewdesc[1] I dont need these descriptors anymore, as they must be redirected to the standards inputoutput of the process they need. End of function codepre  pWell, there is my code. I think I can see the mistake Im doing, when I make olddir be newdir, and create the pipe, Im doing olddir to be also that new pipe right So here comes my questionp  pIs there any way to achieve that change I mean, the thing I want is to equal olddir who is the address of olddesc, right so if I change that address olddescs address will be also changed, right to newdir, in order to continue with the pipe I created before to redirect the standard output of the next child, but I also want newdir to be a NEW pipe. p  pI dont really know if I explained myself right, Im not a native speaker and its a bit difficult to explain these kind of ideas in other language. Feel free to correct any grammar mistake, Id appreciate it, and to ask any question about the code, as maybe Im not giving the point I wanted to.p  pThanks.p

Negative 7430 pI needed to sort an array of large sized objects and it got me thinking emcould there be a way to minimize the number of swapsemp  pSo I used quicksort but any other fast sort should work here too to sort emindicesem to the elements in the array indices are cheap to swap. Then I used those indices to swap the actual objects into their places. Unfortunately this uses On additional space to store the indices. The code below illustrates the algorithm which Im calling strongIndexSortstrong, and in my tests, appears to be faster than plain quicksort for arrays of large sized objects.p  precodetemplate ltclass Itrgt void IndexSortItr begin, Itr end      const sizet count  end  begin       Create indices     vectorltsizetgt indcount     iotaind.begin, ind.end, 0       Sort indices     sortind.begin, ind.end, [ampbegin] const sizet i, const sizet j              return begin[i] lt begin[j]            Create indices to indices. This provides      constant time search in the next step.     vectorltsizetgt ind2count     forsizet i  0 i lt count i         ind2[ind[i]]  i       Swap the objects into their final places     forsizet i  0 i lt count i              if ind[i]  i              continue          swapbegin[i], begin[ind[i]]          const sizet j  ind[i]          swapind[i], ind[ind2[i]]         swapind2[i], ind2[j]       codepre  pNow I have measured the swaps of the large sized objects done by both, quicksort, and IndexSort, and found that quicksort does a far greater number of swaps. So I know why IndexSort emcouldem be faster.p  pBut can anyone with a more academic background explain whyhow does this algorithm actually work its not intuitive to me, although I somehow came up with it.p  pThanksp  pstrongEditstrong The following code was used to verify the results of IndexSortp  precode A class whose objects will be large struct A      int id     char data[1024]       Use the id to compare less than ordering for simplicity     bool operator lt const A ampother const              return id lt other.id            Copy assign all data from another object     void operator  const A ampother              memcpythis, ampother, sizeofA        int main      const sizet arrSize  1000000       Create an array of objects to be sorted     vectorltAgt randArrayarrSize     for auto ampitem randArray          item.id  rand       arr1 will be sorted using quicksort     vectorltAgt arr1arrSize     copyrandArray.begin, randArray.end, arr1.begin       arr2 will be sorted using IndexSort     vectorltAgt arr2arrSize     copyrandArray.begin, randArray.end, arr2.begin                Measure time for this         sortarr1.begin, arr1.end                     Measure time for this         IndexSortarr2.begin, arr2.end            Check if IndexSort yielded the same result as quicksort     if memcmparr1.data, arr2.data, sizeofA  arr1.size  0          cout ltlt sort failed ltlt endl      return 0  codepre  pstrongEditstrong Made the test less pathological reduced the size of the large object class to just 1024 bytes plus one int, and increased the number of objects to be sorted to one million.

But it makes me think, what if stdsort could, at compile time, check the object size, and depending on some size threshold choose either the existing quicksort implemenation or this IndexSort implementation.p  pAlso, IndexSort could be described as an stronginplace tag sortstrong see a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma300674833357851samgaks answer and my comments belowa.p

Negative 7430 pIve upgraded from Mule 3.5.x to 3.6.x and since the old http transport is deprecated in 3.6.x I wanted to migrate to the new HTTP connector.p  pHere is the original code for calling my webservicep  precodelthttpoutboundendpoint refOrderEndpoint docnameGetApprovedOrdergt     ltcxfjaxwsclient serviceClasscom.acme.orders.IOrderServiceBean                 portOrderServiceBeanv20Port                 operationgetApprovedOrderOp gt lthttpoutboundendpointgt codepre  pThe point I have got to with the new connector is as followsp  precodeltcxfjaxwsclient serviceClasscom.acme.orders.v20.IOrderServiceBean portOrderServiceBeanv20Port operationgetApprovedOrderOp gt lthttprequest configrefhttp.request.config pathacmeservicesOrderServiceBeanv20 methodPOST gt codepre  pThe issue that I have is that with the old version of the code, after calling the web service, the payload would be the response [java] object.

Negative 7430 pI am using Xamarin Studio to make an Android Application that gets some commands from the URL it is loading inside a WebView. the way it works is that at the end of the URL after the query string it has an anchor tag. for example it could bep  blockquote   pa hrefhttpwww.google.comLoginenccdVvAfxwMmyIpsfsfDAlTUKrMDoActionOnDetectingThisInTheURL relnofollowhttpwww.google.comLoginenccdVvAfxwMmyIpsfsfDAlTUKrMDoActionOnDetectingThisInTheURLa.p blockquote  pwhere I hope to use OnPageStarted method in the WebViewClient class to see if the  part of the URL matches anything I want it to act on. The problem is that the application does not see the  part of the URL ever. I have checked this in a browser and the anchor tags are there. I am confused as to where to go from here, p

If you observe row with strongId 18strong has strongStudId 22strong and strongFeeId 8strong and strongBalance 100strong, now row with strongId 22strong shows strongBalance 0strong with same student and same fee, meaning this 22 student has paid all fees of strong8 FeeIdstrong,  so I dont  want this student for strongFeeId 8strong. Now the same student has paid fee with strongFeeId 9strong, row with strongId 19 amp 23strong and has two strongBalance 2300 and 2200strong, so I want to show that strongStudId 22strong has strongBalancestrong of 2200 remaining for strongFeeId 9strong, meaning I want to show row with strongId 23strong and strongemNOTemstrong the row with strongId 19strong.

Negative 7430 pI am developing a website with PHP and sending requests with cURL.p  pI have a website, that does some calculations, that I need to get a response from. I am sending requests via cURL Currently what Im doing is to send a request, wait 10 sec and send it again max 3 times, if no good response is received. If all request fail, I flag them for manual fix. p  pThe thing is I want to send a request with 30 sec timeout, and on the 10th second, if no response is received, to send another one with 20 sec timeout, on the 20th second to send last one with 10 sec timeout. Is such thing possible p  pOr if my current code remains and I continue to send requests every 10th second with timeout 10 sec each, can I continue to listen to the first one after I send the second and first and second when Im sending the thirdp  pThank you in advancep

Negative 7430 pI have been following the Christian Richards Photon Server Framework tutorial for quite a bit now, fixing errors here and there. I have came across something that doesnt even throw an error, yet its not doing what it should be. At the end of the tutorial photon episode 14, Christian shows us that the sub server should be registered and showing in the logs. When i build my project, then open it up with the photon control, the logs show everything but that. The logs throw no errors, but do not display what they should be.  For example, the Proxy log SHOULD be saying that it received a register request but it doesnt, as well as the Login saying that there is no existing response handler.p  pComplexServer Logp  blockquote   p48068 195646.598  Service Photon Socket Server starting 48068   195646.598  Config File   CPhotondeploybinWin64PhotonServer.config 48068 195646.599    Will produce at most 10 crash dumps 48068 195646.599  Action run   as exe 48068 195646.600  Server Starting... 48068 195646.600     Tick count 42761421 wraps in 49.2153 days 48068 195646.600    Tick count 64 42761421 48068 195646.600  Photon Version   3.4.8.2804 48068 195646.600  PID 45344 48068 195646.600  Config File CPhotondeploybinWin64PhotonServer.config 48068   195646.601  Will NOT log unimportant exceptions 48068 195646.604    Not using performance counters as they are not currently installed.

Negative 7430 pI am using Xcode 7 GM version to test my app for iOS9.p  pMy app works find on iOS 8 amp 7, while I am testing my app on iOS9 simulator, I find my view size is not correct. I setup my view controller in xib, using autolayout and size class. I only support portrait mode, so all of my constraints are only installed in wcompact, hregular. p  pAfter debugging using Reveal, I found that, the self.view, a UIViewController of mine, embedded in UINavigationController, is always 600600 size and never changed after autolayout.p  pI see there is constraint height600, width600 for self.view, but I never explicitly specify them. The point is why iOS 9 is behavining like this and how do I fix it Thanks.p  pThe self.view is like the root view and I got no chance to set autolayout for it. No idea why it is always and never changed. p  pScreen shot a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comj8eJX.jpg relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comj8eJX.jpg altenter image description hereap  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comxv0Pd.jpg relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comxv0Pd.jpg altenter image description hereap

Negative 7430 pThis is my first time developing in Ruby on Rails, and I am using Neo4j for a database.  I have installed a test version, created some models representing nodes, and written a basic test to make sure everything is working.  The test is very simple it fetches all users and prints their names.p  pWhen I connect to the test database directly and execute Cypher queries to insert data, the tests find the data and react to it correctly.  However, when I specify data in the testfixturesusers.yml file, it does not load.  The test finds only the data inserted manually.  Here is the yml filep  precodeone   name Dan two   name Sam codepre  pWhat am I doing wrong  Is there some setting I have to enable to load yml data into neo4jp  pUPDATE It appears that neo4j is not compatible with Rails fixtures, and for good reason the language is incapable of describing relationships.  I am in the process of developing new, expanded syntax and an implementation that will allow fixtures to be used to test Rails apps that use neo4j.p
