However, when I click on the print button, it appends a print to the URL and gives me a page I have no problem parsing with BeautifulSoup.p  pWhen I enter the url with print appended, it redirects to the nonprint page.

Negative 8488 pA customer is complaining that our code used to write files with Japanese characters in the filename but no longer works in all cases.  We have always just used good old char  strings to represent filenames, so it came as a bit of a shock to me that it ever worked, and we havent done anything I am aware of that should have made it stop working.  I had them send me a file with an embedded filename in it exported from our software, and it looks like the strings use hex characters 82 and 83 as the first character of a doublebyte sequence to represent the Japanese characters.  Poking around online leads me to believe this is probably SHIFTJIS andor Windows codepage 932.p  pIt looks to me like what is happening is previously both fopen and ofstreamopen accepted filenames using this codepage now only fopen does.  Ive checked the Visual Studio fopen docs, and I see no hint of what makes an acceptable string to pass to fopen.p  pIn the short run, Im hoping someone can shed some light on the specific Windows fopen versus ofstreamopen issue for me.  In the long run, Id really like to know the accepted way of opening Unicode and other filenames in C, on Windows, Linux, and OS X.p  pEdited to add I believe that the opens that work are done in the C locale, whereas the ones that do not work are done in whatever the customers default locale is.  However, that has been the case for years now, and the old version of the program still works today on their system, so this seems a longshot for explaining the issue we are seeing.p  pUpdate I sent off a small test program to the customer.  It has verified that fopen works fine with the SHIFTJIS filename, and stdofstream does not.  This is in Visual Studio 2005, and happened regardless of whether I used the default locale or the C locale.p  pIm still interested if anyone has an explanation for this behavior and why it mysteriously changed  perhaps a service pack of VS2005 and hoping to put together a comprehensive best practices for handling Unicode filenames in portable C code.p

Negative 8488 pIm writing some optimized C code that basically runs through an array and does something to each element. What it does depends on the current value of the element so something likep  precodefor i0 i lt alen i      if a[i]  0          a[i]  f1a[i]      else if a[i]  2  0          a[i]  f2a[i]      else          a[i]  0  codepre  pIm returning to C after many years working in dynamic languages, where my practice has been to try to write straightforward code and not create lots of local variables for things that I can just refer to directly, like a[i] above.  emI am very much aware that best practices are to write readable code and trust that the compiler is smarter than you and will do good optimizations.emp  pIf I were writing the code above in assembler, I would load a[i] into a register once and then just use that value each time because I know that a[] is private memory and wont change between references.  However, even a smart compiler might do a load every time because it cant be sure that the memory hasnt changed.  Or do I have to explicitly declare a volatile for the compiler to not make this optimization.p  pSo, my question is should I expect better performance by rewriting with a local variable like sop  precodefor i0 i lt alen i      val  a[i]     if val  0          a[i]  f1val      else if val  2  0          a[i]  f2val      else          a[i]  0  codepre  pOr does stuff like O3 take care of this automatically for me  The code Im optimizing takes days to run, so even modest improvements will make a difference.p

These users then save their votes, and it goes into a database where results can then be displayed. These 20 tokens would replenish once a week, or month, or biweekly or something.p  pThis is the basic idea. Im not asking if this is a good idea. I would just like to know if there is a poll pluginaddon type thing that I can just install on my site that would support this or if this would have to be custom madep  pAdditional features on this site would be that there would be a different section, where users would vote on a typical poll. This poll would ask what topics should be added to the first main poll.p  pIf a plugin exist that would support this could someone tell me or it.p  pOr if this were custom made. How intense would it be I have a novice understanding of PHP and MySQL is this something I could dop  pI appreciate the help,p  pThanksp

Negative 8488 pI must be retarded with searching, because heres another seemingly common problem that I havent been able to solve.p  pHeres my problem  I am using WPF and MVVM, and I have a statemachine that executes in the model.  If an error occurs, I need to pass information up to the ViewModel to display the error.  This part seems to work okay.  When the user clicks the desired behavior, the code in the model continues, and looks at the object the user interacts with to determine what to do next.p  pThe problem is that the model needs to reload a file, which updates the GUI with the contents of said file.  Because the model is executing in a thread, you can imagine what Im going to ask next  how the hell do you synchronize with the GUI properly  In MFC, I would have used either SendMessage or PostMessage to accomplish the GUI update.p  pIve a hrefhttpwww.codeproject.comKBcsbegininvoke.aspxread articles for WinFormsa that suggest using InvokeRequired to automatically call BeginInvoke if necessary.  I actually didnt know that BeginInvoke would accomplish what I wanted, so I was encouraged to learn this.p  pemstrongHow do I actually call BeginInvoke from my model  Does this method even apply to WPFemstrong  I went ahead and implemented a delegate and then called Invoke, but I get the same error that tells me the collection cant be modified from this thread.  I also tried BeginInvoke for the hell of it, but I assume that also wouldnt work because it would just launch from a different thread anyway.p  pConfused.  If I have missed something really obvious thats been posted about all over the internet, go ahead and give me a verbal lashing, I probably deserve it.p  pstrongEDITstrong  I should probably also add that I am looking for something other than a timer or BackgroundWorkerbased solution, unless thats the emonlyem way to solve this in WPF  MVVM.  Also, I wonder if any of the MVVM toolkits would have facilities for this sort of thing already...p

Negative 8488 pI found a question already with a possible solution, but I had already tried the method suggested before reading it, and it even says its inconsistent. So I guess Im wondering why this doesnt workp  precodeimg.clickfunction      var imgwindow  window.openimgwin.html,,width460,height345     alertimgwindow.findimg.attrsrc  codepre  pThe goal is to set the new windows codeimgcode to the same codesrccode as the image that the user clicked to open the new window. But in the above scenario, Im just trying to tap into the new window to get what its alreadyset src. I have codeimgwin.htmlcode already written with a default codesrccode for the image, so it should alert that url. Instead I just get codeundefinedcode.p  pI also tried the following which should be identical on the back end, but with the same resultsp  precodeimg.clickfunction      var imgwindow  window.openimgwin.html,,width460,height345     alertimg,imgwindow.attrsrc  codepre  pI even tried variations of wrapping the codeimgwindowcode variable in codecode in case somehow jquery wasnt picking up on the variable as a DOM element.p  pThe only thing I can guess is that since codewindow.opencode is a method, jquery doesnt treat it like a DOM element, even though all documentation from basic javascript tutorials treat the variable as both a method to open the window and the pointer to the windows inner DOM.p  h2Noteh2  pI usually prefer and recommend to other developers the use of the jqueryui dialog widget, but in this scenario, the images are actually webcam feeds that the user will want to pop out of the main window and have open even if the main window is closed, so while I appreciate the move from popup windows in general, please avoid suggesting alternatives that involve samewindow widgets.

Negative 8488 pI wonder if anyone could help me with a problem Ive been having.p  pI have a number of large images available, but due to space limitations, I cant create multiple copies of these at various sizes. I have used PHP GD functions to resize the images to the sizes I need and output them to the browser. This works, but obviously takes some processing time, which therefore impacts pages load times. Im fine with this, but I only want to show the image once its fully loaded, and have a loading gif in its place until that time. Im using jquery to do this.p  pThe problem Im having is making the page functional whether the client has javascript enabled or not. If JS is not enabled, I want standard img tags to be outputted, otherwise the images are removed and replaced with a loading gif until they have been fully loaded. The link below shows a simple nonjavascript unfriendly example of a what I want to do try turning JS off a hrefhttpjqueryfordesigners.comdemoimageloaddemo.php relnofollowhttpjqueryfordesigners.comdemoimageloaddemo.phpap  pIve been testing the basics using the code below. The attr function will be replaced with something like remove. This is just a test to make something happen to the image before the browser tries to load it.p  precode document.readyfunction    Thumbnails .thumbnail img .attrsrc,    codepre  pIn IE, this works correctly  the image source is replaced with  BEFORE the client browser gets a chance to start downloading the image. In firefox however, it downloads the image, and THEN changes the source. It seems to me that firefox is loading the jquery onready event later than it should. As far as I know, this should be executed before the standard onload event and before anything has started loading. If it helps, Im testing it with a good number of images on screen 81.p  pAm I doing something wrongp

Negative 8488 pIm getting this warning. What Im trying to do is have a family of classes and a parallel family of protocols. The class Piece has a declaration like thisp  precodeinterface Piece  NSManagedObject ltPieceModelgt    ...  property nonatomic, retain Player owner  ...  end codepre  pPieceModel has thisp  precodeprotocol PieceModel ltNSObjectgt  ...  property readonly, nonatomic, retain id ltPlayerModelgt owner  end codepre  pAnd of coursep  precodeinterface Player  NSManagedObject ltPlayerModelgt  ... codepre  pIt seems to me this should all be totally safe. Users of the protocols see that something conforming to the PieceModel protocol has an owner that should conform to the PlayerModel protocol. And in fact, every instance of the Piece class returns a Player instance for the owner property, which conforms to the PlayerModel protocol. I do see why there is such a warning. It would not be so safe to try to assign any object that conforms to PlayerModel to owner, since it might not belong to the Player class, but that is not a problem in this case because the property is declared as readonly for the protocol.p  pNotice I also declared the property as retain, which if I am not mistaken is meaningless for a readonly property, but I also got a different warning about a mismatch between the protocol and the class if I didnt do that. At least the compiler does not complain that one property is readonly and the other is not.p  pI know I could just declare the class property as returning codeid ltPlayerModelgtcode, but that would be undesirable for a couple reasons. Users of Piece objects that have them statically typed as Pieces would have to do a cast to get something statically typed as a Player. Also, I would have to write the property implementation myself instead of just using synthesize, or in this case actually dynamic Core Data generates the property implementations.p  pSo, can I instruct the compiler to suppress this warning Or is there a better way to write this code that wont generate the warningp

Negative 8488 pI have a table that contains partial data that is of no use to the user viewing my application. The viewer wants to see a similar table that has all the values calculated out, and wants to be able to quickly query THAT data. Normally, this would be the perfect place to use a View. Unfortunately the complex nature of the calculations limit my use of Views, so I need an alternate solution. I was thinking of doing something like the following...p  pTable A contains backend data. Any time this table is updated, a trigger fired that updates Table B, which shows the result of these calculations. Table B can be queried quickly at this point.p  pMy only concern is that the calculation procedure is somewhat lengthy, and Table A has the potential to be updated many times in bursts. Are there any solutions that are almost like a Before Select trigger So basically Table A could be updated many times in a row, but the calculation would only occur when Table B was queriedp  pHeres an example timelinep  ol liTable A is Updatedli liTable A is Updated Again [Dont run SP since nobody needs Table B data yet]li liData is requested from Table B [Run SP to update Table B before getting data]li liTable A is Updatedli liData is requested from Table B [Run SP to update Table B before getting data]li liData is requested from Table B [Dont run stored procedure because Table A wasnt updated between requests for Table B data]li ol  pSo my questions arep  ol liIs there anything existing like what I described aboveli liIf not, is there a way to make triggers hold off until the completion of a batch of updatesinserts Table A wont be modified very often, so I can live with a slow trigger when it is updated. The only problem is that when Table A emdoesem get updated, it is normally hundreds of rows at a time and I dont want a slow trigger to run every time.li ol  pThanks for any solutionsinsightp  pEdit  A little more detail on why I think at least the trigger implementation would be slowp  ol liThe application that will be sending the UpdateInsertDelete statements is using LINQtoSQL, which isnt particularly good with batch operations. So if I wanted to delete a bunch of records, it would send a bunch of delete statements instead of a batch delete statement. Is there any way to group delete statements and have the trigger run after that Maybe Im getting too far off topic here.li liThe calculations Im speaking of involve some recursive functions and some decisionmaking processes. The data Im actually dealing with is scheduling data. So Table A contains tasks which may or may not have a scheduled start. If there is no scheduled start defined, it has to derive it from its predecessors scheduled start  its predecessors duration. In some cases the predecessor might not have that information either, hence the recursive query that keeps digging until it finds the result. Its not painfully slow, but if it had to run on every insertupdatedelete, it would get there. The Table B I refer to above is basically the same table, but it already has the calculated scheduled start data within which needs to change on update of Table A.li ol

Negative 8488 pSorry if this makes no sense. Please comment if clarification is needed.p  pIm writing a small file upload app in web.py which I am deploying using modwsgi  apache. I have been having a problem with my session management and would like clarification on how the threading works in web.py.p  pEssentially I embed a code in a hidden field of the html page I render when someone accesses my page. The file upload is then done via a standard POST request containing both the file and the code. Then I retrieve the progress of the file by updating it in the file upload POST method and grabbing it with a GET request to a different class. The session apologies for it being fairly naive is stored in a session object like thisp  precodeclass session      def initself          self.progress  0         self.title           self.finished  False      def advanceself          self.progress  self.progress  1  codepre  pThe sessions are all kept in a global dictionary within my app script and then accessed with my code from earlier as the key. p  pFor some reason my progress seems to stay at 0 and never increments. Ive been debugging for a couple hours now and Ive found that the two session objects referenced from the upload class and the progress class are not the same. The two codes, however, are as far as I can tell equal. This is driving me mad as it worked without any problems on the web.py test server on my local machine.p  pEDIT After some research it seems that the dictionary may get copied for every request. Ive tried putting the dictionary in another and importing but this doesnt work. Is there some other way short of using a database to seperate the sessions dictionaryp

Negative 8488 pI am using jQueryMobile for a mobile application. Obviously I want the UI to load very quickly, but the application has more than one tool so I want to only load the relevant external JS libraries for the pages when they are navigated to. For the main application 90 of the pages I just want the jQueryMobile core files i.e. the latest jquery core from the Google AJAX libraries and the jQueryMobile JS amp CSS. However, for the remaining 10 I need Google Maps v3 with geolocation enabled so the Google Gears external library and the MarkerClusterer library I have 400 markers that I want to plot only if I have to.p  pAs I understand how jQueryMobile works all via internal AJAX requests, you emmustem have all the libraries for the whole application load when the application initializes. This makes my application emreallyem heavy when the user first requests the mobile site all core files, plus all mapsgelocationmarker cluster files. I want to avoid that happening, as it will scare many potential users away especially when only a subset of my users want the geolocation goodiness.p  pI have tried loading just the Google Maps components at the end of the relevant page before the footer div and also tried putting them into the ltheadgt tag in the relevant page. However both these fail to initialize checked with console.log output attached to the functions.p  pAnd yes, before you ask, I am using the pagecreate live function and am addressing the correct div If I put everything related to Google Maps into the root page head tag everything works just fine as it shouldp  pI feel like this must be a pretty common question selective loading of page components with jQueryMobile. I couldnt find anything online via Google  most jQueryMobile tutorials are the common garden Hello World variety, so if you have anything to offer I am all ears Links to selective loading tutorials also welcomep  pThanks in advancep

Here is a shot of the reportp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comwxwsv.png altreport screenshotp  pThis seems to indicate that Regex.Replace is the bottleneck and I should therefore try to reduce or eliminate this use as much as possible.

Remember, as Deepak points out, to adopt the codeUITableViewDatasourcecode and codeUITableViewDelegatecode in the header file.p

Negative 8488 pYes, Im one of those fellows that is learning C coming from Java, being spoiled with an automatic garbage collector. Theres a particular situation where Im wondering whether Im leaking memory or not. Lets consider in Cp  precodebool test  new boolfalse test  new booltrue delete test codepre  pAm I leaking memory here Or should I first call codedeletecode before assigning a new value Like thisp  precodebool test  new boolfalse delete test test  new booltrue delete test codepre  pMy gut feeling tells me the first is right, as the pointer codetestcode points at the same address in memory, and assigning a new value to its variable, will not change this address. Or does the codenewcode operator allocate a different address in memory Can anyone give me a clue, or did I get it wrong all togetherp

Negative 8488 pI read this in literature that leftdeep join tree are less favorable than right deep tree as far as parallelism is concerned.

Negative 8488 pI have a thorny question about transforming Linq Expressions. I had a good search about, but I couldnt find anything that seems to cover this case. Im reasonably familiar with Linq, at least in terms of creating and passing lambdas to methods, but Im somewhat weaker on the Expression stuff. p  pFirst, some context I have a generic persistence solution based on NHibernate used inside a number of DDDish projects. For special cases where a given collection of children within an aggregate could be essentially infinite ie very large indeed, I cannot simply map a set or bag as it would never be acceptable for the entire collection to be loaded into memory. In this architecture its not possible for code consuming the API to talk to the Repository directly to do a query or limit the results that way. I could of course not have a collection in the API at all and expose methods to retrieve relevant subsets of child objects instead and if this doesnt work thats what Ill do, but Im trying to do something slightly different and Ive emalmostem got it working...p  pThese projects are being mapped with Fluent not automapping, and so I added a method to my base map class in the formp  precodeHasManyQueryableltTCollectiongtExpressionltFuncltT, IQueryableltTCollectiongtgtgt memberExpression, ExpressionltFuncltT, TCollection, boolgtgt selector codepre  pThis method derives the relevant codePropertyInfocode from the first codeExpressioncode which specifies the member to map. The selector codeExpressioncode contains the relationship between the parent and child objects as a substitute for a normal NHibernate mapping.p  pSo, suppose I have a selector in the map for a domain type codeUsercode which is codeTcode abovep  precodeHasManyQueryableltTransactiongtx gt x.Transactions, u, t gt t.User  u codepre  pThis specifies a mapping between the subset of all codeTransactionscode where codeTransaction.Usercode is the supplied codeUsercode emuem, and the codeUser.Transactionscode property which is codeIQueryableltTransactiongtcode. When an actual codeUsercode object is constructed, I need to turn this into p  precodeExpressionltFuncltTransaction, boolgtgt expression  t gt t.User  this codepre  pwhere codethiscode is the codeUsercode object being constructed. In other words, I want to take a general rule that says how to map codeUserscode to codeTransactionscode and turn it into a rule about mapping emthisem codeUsercode to codeTransactionscode. I can then use this expression to generate an codeIQueryableltTransactiongtcode from the Repository by doing a Linq query, thusp  precodereturn Repository.ForltTransactiongt.Whereselector codepre  pThis can only work when the selector is codeFuncltTransaction, boolgtcode, hence my ultimate need is to turn the original expression, which would generate a codeFuncltUser, Transaction, boolgtcode into codeFuncltTransaction, boolgtcode.p  pThis gives me an codeIQueryablecode collection where all the query operations are being done as LinqtoNHibernate queries and thus the entire collection never gets loaded into memory yes, I know you could frame a query that would actually make it do that, but I can catch those at code review time.p  pPhew. Hope that makes sense.p  pAnyone with leet Expression rewriting skills able to point me in the right directionp

Class c  Class.forNameclassName         Object o  c.newInstance          Q2Generator g  new Q2Generator  Class created from the JET Template         String result  g.generateo         System.out.printlnresult       codepre  pBut obviously, codec.newInstancecode doesnt work for an interface. Is there another way I could possibly feed an object of the interface through to the codegeneratecode method I need the object of the interface because in the Q2Generators codegeneratecode method, it takes information about the method declarations in the interface from the object argument.p  pIm not sure if that provides enough context, but if it isnt enough there are more details in another question I asked here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7762304usingjettogeneratecodeindentingcodeUsing JET to generate code Indenting codeap  pThanks.p
Negative 8488 pIm an independent developer coming from Java to .Net Desktop.  So Im up against a learning curve and tend to think in terms of Java technologies.p  pAnyway Im making a native desktop app for Windows later you will buy it and we will all be happy  The app will be made with C and WPF for the best user experience very important.  While the priority is this best possible user experience I still want my code to be as portable as possible for future ports to other platforms.  Obviously the GUI parts will be platform specific but there is also a lot of database type code that could be cross platform.p  pSo for a certain package in the Full desktop API I guess you guys call it the framework is there a place I can get all this compatibility infop

return. If you only databind the Date proeprty and not the hours and minutes than you find that both of those are set to 0. p  pThe reason for this is that once you navigate off of a tab you dispose of the user controll and when you navigate back you greate a new user controll .Net 4.p  pBinding to the Hours and minutes is fugly, and does not amke sense for the consumer as it expects a DateTime object.p  pIm tring to figure out what the corect pattern would be for making the hours and minutes reload when the usercontrol gets recreated.p  pthis is how the usercontrol is used in the applicationp

Negative 8488 pIm making a prime number sieve using Eratosthenes Sieve in C using multiple threads, but when I use more than one thread, the results are inconsistent.  The range it has to be able to go through is 1232.  When run with a smaller range, like 11024, it comes up with the right number of primes usually, but as the range gets bigger, so does the margin of error.  Im assuming its a race condition, since I dont use mutexes and would prefer not to, since it shouldnt be necessary with how the program is set up, or theres something wrong with how Im sending data to the thread function.  Im still getting used to C and its pointersreferencing.  The number of primes it finds is always greater than or equal to the actual number, never less than.  The index of the bit in a bitmap gets set to 1 for composite numbers.  Its probably just some stupid little bug Im overlooking from lack of CC experience.  Please let me know if Ive been unclear about anything.

Negative 8488 pOk so I have built my WCF service and its functioning great However, I am starting to implement it into our preexisting piece of software now and I am instantly running into the question, do I only use the proxy generated code and get rid of the dll that I used initially Or do I keep both, and make distinctions between the two very obvious p  pWhat I mean by keeping distinctions is, having a ServerUser and a LocalUser property that represent the same user object. However, my LocalUser property would be filled via the dll that the app initally ran with, if the application service is unavailable.p  pMy main reasoning for this thought pattern is that if I remove my dll, I have a single point of failure. If for some reason my ServiceHost is just not up and running, but the DB server is, I would want my users to still be able to do their job. The features that the new WCF implementation utilize are not dependant for employees to do their job. It is more of a convenience in what the WCF service provides. Also, building in this kind of logic to the Service would allow service modifications more readily available in a non IIS hosted environment. p  pAlso, is there a way to build in logic on the service so that when I pull down the proxy code for the client that it just knows to access the DB manually if the ServiceHost is unavailable If this was a possibility, I think about 90 of all my problems would disappear.p  pThank you in advancep

Negative 8488 pI recently spent some time to try minitest in my rails model tests and it works great.p  pI found a lot of resources on how to configure rails to use minitest amont the others the excellent railscast on this topic.

MySQL has a connector for EF4, the current version is 6.3.5 and its main functionalities are working fine but it still has issues with a few methods, e.g. System.Data.Objects.ObjectContext.CreateDatabase System.Data.Objects.ObjectContext.DatabaseExists which makes it difficult to fully use the modelfirst approach. Its possible by manually editing the MySQL script available with the CreateDatabaseScript method. The MySQL team doesnt seem eager to solve those bugs, Im not sure what the commitment level actually is from their part but it certainly is lower than it once was. That being said, the same methods fail with SQL CE too they are not implemented, and I dont see the MS team as likely to tackle that soon.p  hr  pRan out of space below... it just becomes a problem when create a database, and it does not create the log.ldf file, but just the ldf file, then use the database, and it creates a log.ldf file... now you have 2 ldf files.. one becomes invalid..  Then when done with the database, delete it, then try to create a new, and a ldf exists, it will not work....  p  hr  pit turns out this is just the way it is with EF4, and they changed with EF4.5 beta to create the log.ldf file to match what is created when the database is used.p  pthanks for time. p

It could have just been a warning instead of a fullfledged error. Afterall we could want to keep the catch block as a backup for some future changes we might make or maybe the programmer just forgot to remove it after some edits. p  pI know i know it saves us from unnecessary keystrokes etc. etc. But it shouldnt bother compiler that much to raise an error. Or is there some other reason for thisp  pAlso an IOException catch block in the code produces an compiler error but an Exception catch block does not... why is that Thnx in advancep

Negative 8488 pIm building an app that allows users to view pictures off a website. I load the pictures on screen, and then once the user taps on one, I give him the option to add it to his favorites.p  pSo as to allow him to view the images offline, I store the UIImageJpegRepresentation in an NSMutableDictionary which later goes into NSUserDefaults.p  pWhen the user is in the onlineimage viewing section, if he comes across a favorited image, he can remove it from favorites I check if thats one of his favorites by comparing the NSData to what Id stored into NSUserDefaults.p  pNow heres the problem when the user goes into the favorites section and loads the images from NSUserDefaults, the comparison of the NSData in NSUserDefaults to the NSData of the image in the image views on the screen fails. So when he taps on an image while in the favorites section, its not detected that the image itself is a favorite in NSUserDefaults and I assume the two NSData are different for some reason.p  pCould someone please shed a light on why this happens and potentially give a hint on how to solve itp

Negative 8488 pI have found help for subclassing of a mapped superclass, and I have found help on how to map a TreeMap.   However, I can not find anything that covers using a TreeMap in a subclass at all.  Here is the situation    I am adding a function to a longexisting application.  That application has mapped entities, a certain set of which, form a hierarchy.   There is a , for instance that establishes the base class.  Then there are many many MANY subclasses that use the  elements to map the individual subclasses.  The subclasses all use  elements to reference the additional table that holds the attributes of the subclass.  This has worked for several years and life has seemingly been good.p  pNow along comes my work effort and I need to use a TreeMap in my new subclass entity extending the same base class as all of the others so the first thing that I do is attempt to map it the same way other subclasses do,  with a  inside a .p  pMaking the story short, I got an error when I started the app and Hibernate began mapping.  Researching this error led me to review the DTD for hibernate mapping files and, guess what  According to my interpretation, one can not configure a Map of any kind inside a .p  pThat same research exposed me to the  which CAN contain a Map.   So, off I go configuring a  inside the base class mapping.p  pWhen I did this, I got bizarre errors referencing symbols that I cant even find in the code, in mappings.... anywhere   More research and I find a reference in the Hibernate reference manual, Chapter 9, that says that Hibernate does not support mixing of  and  elements.  So that cant be done either.p  pMy question is  is there a solution that I have missed along the way  From the sound of things it seems that you can NOT configure a map in a subclass if you are using  because the  inside it wont take a map....     and, while a Map can be configured in a , I doubt that I can gather up much support around here for wading through the current mapping files and remapping ALL  entities as  entities.p  pHas anybody got any ideas   If I am not looking at this right, believe me, I am willing to accept that and learnp  pThanks in advance for any help that might be provided.p

Negative 8488 pIm trying to get a better sense of codeRubycode. So Ruby makes codeMixinscode a first class concept. In codeCcode one can create codeExtension Methodscode that act on codeInterfacescode. So both techniques provide a mechanism that is widely known as a codeMixincode.p  pIt might be good to compare both approaches on a specific example. p  pstrongEnumerable in Rubystrongp  pLets take all those beautiful methods that work up on a collection. In Ruby those are codeallcode, codeanycode, codecountcode and a lot more a hrefhttprubydoc.orgcore1.9.3Enumerable.html relnofollowhttprubydoc.orgcore1.9.3Enumerable.htmlap  pFrom the documentation emThe Enumerable mixin provides collection classes with several traversal and searching methods, and with the ability to sort. The class must provide a method each, which yields successive members of the collection.emp  pstrongEnumerable in Cstrongp  pIn codeCcode there is the feature called codeLINQcode that also provides those methods codeAllcode, codeAnycode, codeCountcode and a lot more.p  pIf you want to make your class codeLINQ enabledcode you need to implement the codeIEnumerableltTgtcode interface which forces you to also provide a method codeGetEnumeratorcode which conceptually is very close to the ruby approach.p  pSo from the perspective of a bird your class now gained all those methods mentioned above. How did it happend p  pWell code.NETcode defined all those codeLINQcode methods as codeExtension Methodscode on the codeIEnumerableltTgtcode interface. And since you implemented this interface you now mixin all those methods. p  pI wonder how much both approaches differ and if there are things codeRuby Mixinscode can do that codeCscode codeInterfacecode  codeExtension Methodcode Strategy cant Well, beside the fact that codeRuby Mixinscode can be mixed at runtime.p

Negative 8488 pI am trying to use Jenkins to keep my master branch stable, as described a hrefhttpblog.cloudbees.com201203dontphunkwithmystablebranch.html relnofollowherea.  Basically, developers check push into the integration branch and only the Jenkins instance merges from integration into master.  My project consists of multiple RTL verilog, vhdl, etc subcomponents which each have their own testbench and can be built separately.  The gitplugin supports filtering based on changed files before running a test, but I want to require all the changed subcomponents to build successfully before merging. i.e. If my directory structure looks likep  precodesrc     A     B     C     share test     A     B     C codepre  pIf something in just srcA changes, then only test A needs to succeed before merging integration into master.  If srcshare changes, then tests A, B, and C need to run before merging integration into branch.  All of the tests can be run in parallel.  p  pIve looked into using forkplugin and parameterizedtriggerplugin, but it looks like they need to be statically configured.  Is there a way of dealing with this type of dynamic dependency diamond and having Jenkins merge integration into master only if everything succeedsp  pThanks in advancep

Negative 8488 pI am using the a hrefhttpwww.woothemes.comflexslider relnofollowFlexSlidera jQuery plugin to run a slider on my sites homepage. I picked this slider because it is responsive. The big problem Im having with it is that I have it inside of a codepositionfixedcode element and it is causing problems with the responsive scaling. When I make my browser window wider the slides scale up, awesome. However when I scale the window down the slides do not scale back down. This only happens when the slider is located within a fixed element. This problem also happens with the demo that FlexSlider provides. In the demo to make it break all you have to do is add codepositionfixedcode to the codeltsection classslidergtcode element.p  pDoes anybody have an ideas on a workaround for this problem Changing my container element to something other than fixed is not an option.p

So, I am at a lost on how to solve this issue where there is a candidate key but the information in the records for the duplicates on this candidate key column are different. What I want to have done is what Excel 2007s Remove Duplicates procedure does where duplicates on one column can be removed and retain others.p

Negative 8488 pI am a relative newcomer to R and not a mathematician but a geneticist. I have many sets of multiple pairs of data points. When they are plotted they yield a flattened S curve with most of the data points ending up near the zero mark. A minority of the data points fly far off creating what is almost two J curves, one down and one up. I need to find the inflection points where the data sharply veers upward or downward. This may be an issue with my math but is seems to me that if I can smooth and fit a curve to the line and get an equation I could then take the second derivative of the curve and determine the inflection points from where the second derivative changes sign. I tried it in excel and used the curve to get approximate fit to get the starting formula but the data has a bit of wiggling in it so determining any one inflection point is not possible even if I wanted to do it all manually which I dont. Each of the hundreds of data sets that I have to find these two inflection points in will yield about the same curve but will have slightly different inflection points and determining those inflections points precisely is absolutely critical to the problem. So if I can set it up properly once in an equation that should do it. For simplicity I would like to break them into the positive curve and the negative curve and do each one separately. Maybe there is some easier formula for s curves that makes that a bad ideap  pI have tried reading the manual and its kind of hard to understand likely because of my weak math skills. I have also been unable to find any similar examples I could study from. p  pThis is the head of my data set            x           y        [1,]    1  0.00000000        [2,]    2  0.00062360        [3,]    3  0.00079720        [4,]    4  0.00085100        [5,]    5  0.00129020p  pX is just numbering 1 to however many data points and the number of X will vary a bit by the individual set.p  pThis is as far as I have gotten to resolve the curve fitting partp  blockquote   pposcurve1 lt nlscurvefitting  scalxscal,data  cbind.data.framecurvefitting,                         start  listx  0, scal  0.01       Error in numericDerivform[[3L]], namesind, env         Missing value or an infinity produced when evaluating the model       In addition Warning messages       1 In minx  no nonmissing arguments to min returning Inf       2 In maxx  no nonmissing arguments to max returning Infp blockquote  pAm I just doing the math the hard way What am I doing wrong with the nls Any help would be much  much appreciated.p

The CP mocks are needed to simulate the environment of that BT orchestration. We cannot control individual mocked responses via SSonar requests the for cloudport incoming client requests are made by Production code and cannot be altered or controled by our SSonar client. The only Tasks functionality that worked for us is a DBtable working as an offline channel bw SSonar and CP SSonar writes in it and CP reads from it. CloudPorts reading of, say, responseXmls, from DB works fine but we cannot find a way to implement further behavior controlling logic on the CP side. Therefore, this stackoverflow posting.

Negative 8488 pI was writing a shell script , where it will look for filesZIP in a directory using ls command and unzip them in destination , the problem is that the file name is having spaces between ,so when script is scanning it considering only name after space p  pExample if File name is a b c.zip , only c.zip is considered to be file name and then it say file not found.p  pSo please let me know how to handle this p  pi thought if i can enclose the file name in double quotes it should work.so i was looking how can i add the double quote to last field of ls command . i need all the field of ls command since i am checking for file size and timestamp as well before unzip ,so i need to enclose only file name with double quotes which is the last field of ls command.p  pRegards, Sathyap
Negative 8488 pHi there trying to make a game and sturgging as its the first time iam playing around with the gui in java. All i am trying to figure out is how do i make a box with a black border which is this size foe example p  precode                                                                                                     codepre  pThen when the user clicks on it it will change the black border to a red border and then the user can write a number in it from 15. Thanks for the help. p
Negative 8488 pHello I wanted to poll the public about my idea of doing a string class like codestdstringcode that would have a feature of being able to work on buffers provided by the client.p  pWhat are the dangers that you forsee  is it a classic smell  etcaeterap  pI mean like sop  precodechar ext[64]  0 mystring sext, mystringacquireRW sizet len  s.size sizet pos  s.findzboub mystring s2s    uses true alloccopy semantic here. codepre  pSo I forsee 2 strategies codeacquireRWcode and codeacquireROcode that would permit modification of characters in codeextcode or not. And in the codeROcode case for any nonconst method, and codeRWcode cases in methods where buffer has to be expanded it would alloc amp copy at this moment only.p  pIn a way, the codemystringcode type becomes a decorator of the codecharcode type.p  pOf course being careful of not freeing the external buffer before the decorator is left as a requirement to the client.p  pThanks for sharing your concernsp

Negative 8488 pTitle Conditional Validation for ViewModel Fields on ASP MVCp  pI have a question about ASP MVC validtion. Lets say that I have the follwing View Modelp  precodepublic class PersonViewModel      [Required]     public string Name get set       [Required]     public string Email get set   codepre  pAccording to this when I submit the form MVC will validate that both fields have values. However, in my website I have the situation where the Email can be turned off in a global site setting, so the model will only render the Name Textbox on the form. Now when I submit the form it still asks me for the Email field since it is indicated as Required, despite there is no way the user can fill that field now.p  pIs there a solution for this type of scenario when using ASP MVC validationsp

Negative 8488 pI currently have a dll containing a TForm descendant that gets displayed when an exported function is called. The client applications have varying release cycles so this minimizes unnecessary changes to them when the dll has to change. There are well known problems with this approach stemming from dll and client apps having different instances of TApplication so I wont elaborate further. BPLs are the recommended solution to this problem but arent currently an option because the client applications are compiled in different versions of Delphi and Id like to keep the option open for reuse in a few nondelphi applications as well.p  pTo avoid these problems I am attempting to replace the dll with an ocx containing a self contained emActive Formem control that can be displayed in the client applications by dropping it onto a form either in a TOleContainer or as a wrapped control.p  pUsing the documentation and some tutorials I created an ocx project, active form and registered it. I then set about getting it into a test application. I had no problem getting the control to display in a TOleContainer but it wouldnt respond to mouse or keyboard actions. I thought it might be a limitation of TOleContainer so I imported the ocx using Import Component and dropped the resulting VCL component wrapper onto my form. Same result. No response to any mouse or keyboard actions. With the exception that rightclicking the control displays a Properties context menup  pIve read and reread the documentation and tutorials and dont see that Ive missed any steps. According to them it just works. Im sure there is something Im missing.p
Negative 8488 pI am building a a hrefhttpsgithub.comrailsapirailsapi relnofollowJSONonly applicationa, it is basically a leaner Rails, with fewer middleware and fewer modules. This is an application being built in Rails 4.p  pI want toe to develop a simple app that can administrate the data in the database for the mainapp. For this I would like to use a hrefhttpactiveadmin.info relnofollowActive Admina or a hrefhttpsgithub.comsferikrailsadmin relnofollowRails Admina. But both options somehow use the underlying models and their validations, requirements and such to build on top of. p  pThis means that I need to share at least the models between the main application and the RailsAdmin application.p  pHow would I best do this Is there a good guide on how to build an administrationapplication in a separate rails app next to your main one, instead of having it integratedp  pAs a sidenote another good reason to keep the admin in a separate application from the main app, but on a shared database, is the myriad of dependencies, a gem like ActiveAdmin comes with.p  pAlso note that I am not simply interested in running admin on a different domain or different server, but mostly to keep main app lean and focused. And to keep the dependencies with which something like ActiveAdmin comes, out of my main app.p  hr  pfootnotesp  ul liActiveAdmin, nor RailsAdmin are a problem for performance in themselves. Its that they require all Middleware, whereas a JSONonly Railapp, needs only very few modules, helpers and Middelwares RailsAPI, offers such a slim stack. Performance is not about Admin vs. no admin, but FullRails vs RailsAPI.li liPerformance is not my main problem, the dependencies and bloat is I now have a Rails applicatio that is so slim, focused and lean, that it can measure itself with most Sinatra apps . With only three additional gems each with a few dependencies of their own and a very thin stack of Middelware, I can upgrade, manage and debug very easily.li ul  pMore practical I emdontem have Devise Its a JSONAPI, so tokenauthenticated, emdontem have any views or templateengine. No Formtastic, No Paperclip, Rmagic, Kminari pagers and so on and so forth. All of which will be added to my app when I pull in just an admin. p

beyond the stage and then remove them from the stage and splice from the Array but ... when I increase the speed of spawning when i have 2 rows with 5 ships on the stage or morethat doest work.p  pAnd

Negative 8488 pI have a website that has seperate domains but runs on the same the server. They have seperate logins and are basically seperate entities even though they use the same pages with varying artwork controlled by javascript.p  pWhat I am basically looking for now is a way to control Domain Jumping. Thus I want to have a way to check the current url and the previous url and then compare domains. If the domains differ then the person would be redirected to the previous page or login page of the previous url.p  pI tried to do this with the SESSION variable but I cant seem to get the logic right.p  pHas anyone got an example they could show mep  pOk the brain is finally waking up. What ive done is created 2 session variables, 1 for the current domain and 1 for the previous domain. Then on each page I compare the current and previous domains. If they dont match I redirect the user back to the previous domains logon page and if they do match I set the previous domain equal the current domain.p  pDoes this seem like a robust solution or is there a better way to do this p  pThanksp

Negative 8488 pMy goal is to have a Postgres setup that I can use to develop my rails app and then push it to Heroku without having to change the database config file. Seems simple enough, rightp  pIve seen plenty of things on the internet about PostgreSQL 9.2.x not running on OS X 10.8, and Im still struggling to get it working with Rails. Not realizing that a version of PSQL shipped with OS X, I set out to install it. NOTE Im sort of debugging in circles, so things may not have worked as I expected.p  pIve tried downloading and installing using a hrefhttpwww.postgresql.orgdownloadmacosx relnofollowthe official graphical installer listed herea,  and I rebooted my Mac. I saw an extra user account was created, and I promptly deleted it. I know, I know, probably what caused some heartache down the line, but it didnt seem reasonable to have an extra user account sitting around.p  pUpon running my rails app, it couldnt connect to postgres. I tried running psql from Terminal. p  precodepsql could not connect to server No such file or directory     Is the server running locally and accepting     connections on Unix domain socket varpgsqlsocket.s.PGSQL.5432 codepre  pI then proceeded to install Postgres with homebrew. I installed homebrew, then postgres. Same thing. I googled a bit and ran into a thread on the Postgres forum. What I got from it was that something changed between OS X 10.7 and 10.8, but that wasnt the cause of my problem.p  pNext, I tried using a hrefhttppostgresapp.com relnofollowselfcontained the Postgres.appa. Now, I was able to create users and connect to the database. Rails was able to connect to Postgres, but complained that the database that I defined in codeconfig.yamlcode was absent. So I created it  or so I thought. p  pRunning codeCREATE DATABASE mydbcode in the selfcontained version of PSQL didnt work  even though without the self contained app, PSQL would have that socket error. I then tried creating a new user with write access. Nope. The codeCREATEcode was silently failing. p  pI tried adding localhost to my environment variable and it seemed to have solved the port error  but now Rails was having trouble finding Postgres again.p  pI uninstalled the brew version.

Negative 8488 pSolution a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions17381652primefacesdialognotreopeningwhenajaxcloseeventlistenerincludedherea. Showing and hiding codedialogcode from within bean.p  hr  pI have a codedialogcode and showhide buttons which works fine. Dialog reads codebooleancode value from backing bean and updates its codevisiblecode attribute which makes it show or hide. Everything works fine until I close dialog using default close button, which fires ajax codeclosecode event. From that moment on showhide buttons does not work, or rather dialog does not update its codevisiblecode state. It stays closed forever.p  pI found out that, after ajax event is fired, everything updates correctly except dialog codevisiblecode attribute. Buttons works fine, they updates backing bean correctly I can see it in log file, and also dialog panel is updated correctly I can see correct codeshowDialogcode value displayed on screen.p  pI know there are other ways to showhide dialogs, yet I am really curious what is happening in this case  why it works that way Is there any way to display dialog by reading visibility value from bean and whats more important to update bean value when dialog is closingp  pMy XHTMLp  pre classlanghtml prettyprintoverridecodelthformgt     ltpcommandButton valueshow d1 actionListenertestBean.enableShowDialog updatedialogIdgt     ltpcommandButton valuehide d1 actionListenertestBean.disableShowDialog updatedialogIdgt lthformgt ltpoutputPanel iddialogIdgt     showDialog value  testBean.showDialog     ltpdialog headerd1 visibletestBean.showDialoggt         ltpajax eventclose listenertestBean.disableShowDialog updatedialogIdgt         test     ltpdialoggt ltpoutputPanelgt codepre  pAnd backing beanp  pre classlangjava prettyprintoverridecodeManagedBean ViewScoped public class TestBean implements Serializable      private static final Logger LOGGER  LoggerFactory.getLoggerTB      private boolean showDialog      public boolean isShowDialog          LOGGER.infogetter isShowDialog, showDialog         return showDialog           public void enableShowDialog          showDialog  true         LOGGER.infoisShowDialog set to true           public void disableShowDialog          showDialog  false         LOGGER.infoisShowDialog set to false       codepre
Negative 8488 pI have two sets of 2D points, separated from each other by a line in the plane. Id like to efficiently find the pair of points, consisting of one point from each set, with the minimum distance between them. Theres a really convenient looking paper by Radu Litiu, emClosest Pair for Two Separated Sets of Pointsem, but it uses an L1 Manhattan distance metric instead of Euclidean distance. p  pDoes anyone know of a similar algorithm which works with Euclidean distancep  pI can just about see an extension of the standard divide amp conquer closest pair algorithm  divide the two sets by a median line perpendicular to the original splitting line, recurse on the two sides, then look for a closer pair consisting of one point from each side of the median. If the minimal distance from the recursive step is d, then the companion for a point on one side of the median must lie within a box of dimensions 2dd. But unlike with the original algorithm, I cant see any way to bound the number of points within that box, so the algorithm as a whole just becomes Omn.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 8488 pOk, Ive searched a little about this problem and didnt find much.br For example i have one worker and two different sources of tasks. One of them is scheduled with beat, starting one little tasks each hour, another one have enormous number of tasks, which will be going non stop for something about month. Problem is that this little tasks will never ran, or it will be with huge delay.br So, of course i tried to separate them in different queues but this makes no sense since both of them are processed by single worker two different workers are ok, but its not the case of my question. I want to know if there is built in mechanism for prioritizing queues for celery worker. Or, at least i would like if someone will point me on some information about how do worker selects which task from which queue must be processed at that moment. With one queue it seems to be straightforward, linear. But what about different queues processed by same workerp  pThank Youp

Negative 8488 pIm developing a game on iOS and Android in C using cocos2dx. I have a function that implements the A pathfinding algorithm. I have developed and tested this on iOS and it works flawlessly. On Android, however, this function causes a crash. How is it possible that the same C logic will run smoothly on the one device, but not on the otherp  pUnfortunately the function is a rather large one, but Ill post it anyway. If its too long to read through, Ill be happy with some general pointers regarding the sort of pitfalls that may cause a crash on one device device but not the other. Heres what I think is happening. A pathStep struct which contains a few ints, and also has a pathStep pointer to its parent the previous step for the initial step is created. Its index is set to equal the start index, and its address is added to the open list. Somehow, though, when its retrieved from the open list at the beginning of the loop, its index has changed from whatever it was set to to 0.p  pHeres the functionp  precodestdvectorltpathStepgt

Negative 8488 pMy app has a bacground service in it, which currently uses C2DM. I want to migrate to GCM.p  pThere are 2 GCM implementations available to mep  p1 using gcm.jar and replace the C2DM email address with the sender ID p  p2 use Google Play Services and the GoogleCloudMessaging class to register for GCMp  pOption 1 above provides the simplest migration path from C2DM to GCM, however, that gcm.jar is deprecated. So Id be moving from one deprecated push mechanism C2DM to another GCM using the gcm.jarp  pOption 2, requires you to check that the GooglePlayServices are up to date on your device before you can register for GCM. You can make the Google Play Services ready for use by calling GooglePlayServicesUtil.getErrorDialog api. However, I cant call this api from a background service as it may result in screens being displayed to the user, something which you should not do from a background service.p  pCurrently I have both C2DM and GCM using Google Play Services active in my Android client. I would prefer to have just GCM active, and to drop C2DM, but if the Google Play Services are not ready for use on the device, then I cant use GCM. Now I could have a situation where my background service is not registered for GCM and if it had continued to use C2DM it would have be registered for that. p  pQuestionsp  p1 What is Googles recommended migration path for C2DMGCM for background services. Should I use the gcm.jar approach, even though its deprecatedp  p2 If Google Play Services are not currently available on the device, should you fall back to using C2DM, rather than call GooglePlayServicesUtil.getErrorDialogp  p3 Having both C2DM and GCM active in my client is unsatisfactory. When I register for GCM using GoogleCloudMessaging.registersenderId, a com.google.android.c2dm.intent.REGISTRATION message is broadcast, which is picked up my my C2DM receiver. I can not tell if the message is a C2DM registration message or a GCM registration message. Is there a way to distinguish between the 2 registration messages I know that GoogleCloudMessaging.register returns the registration Id, but it also results in that com.google.android.c2dm.intent.REGISTRATION message being broadcast which seems unnecessary and confuses the real C2DM receiver.p  pI welcome your advise  insight into my problem. The documentation around Google Play services seems a little light and does not address its use from background services.p  pKind regardsp

The first and most problematic to me is when I try to use the stream object as a normal fstream object. If I open the fstream in its constructor, then all is fine and dandy as can be seen in the first two anonymous scopes. But if I allocate the fstream object and then attempt to open it later, Bad Things happen.p  pIf I try to invoke boostiostreamsstreamopen, I get compiler errors saying that it cant convert parameter 1 boostfilesystempath to a boostiostreamsfiledescriptorsink. Why should that not work when it can be constructed with a boostfilesystempath In either case, attempting to call boostiostreamsfiledescriptorsinkopen by using the streams operator fails an assertion as shown in the third anonymous scope. This is quite evil as it would seem to me that it should throw an exception instead of failing an assertion. Failing an assertion would indicate to me that theres a bug in the boost code.p  pThe second failure I have is that the codetypedefcodeed fstream and ofstream seem to work well, compile and link just fine. But when I try to use the ifstream, I get a linker failure when trying to call ifstreamopen I get this on Windows MinGW configuration as stated before as well as on OS X 10.8.5 with codeApple LLVM version 4.2 clang425.0.28 based on LLVM 3.2svncode. Since it compiles fine and the only difference between the two there is whether its a source or a sink... and both should be able to open a file... it makes me think that this is also a bug in boost.p  pAny thoughts or suggestionsp

Usually I am able to determine which cells are bold and which are not using this UDFp  precodeFunction isBoldcellBold     Application.Volatile     If cellBold.Font.Bold  True Then         isBold  1     ElseIf cellBold.Font.Bold  False Then     isBold  0     Else         isBold  0     End If End Function codepre  pThis works well on cells that actually have bold applied to the cells EXCEPT that the data is imported and the original source alters the text from regular to bold by altering the font, not by applying bold to the cell.p  pFor example, the regular font is Times New Roman and the bold font is Times New Roman Bold.  Because of this, although on the page it looks as though the cell has had bold applied to it, the UDF above doesnt work.p  pHow can I alter the UDF so that the font is identifiedp

Negative 8488 pI have tried to implement face detection algo for people with wide range of skin color, in different illumination conditions e.g. darkness, disco lights, sunny day. First thing that comes in mind is based on thresholding of Hue and Saturation as they are illumination invariant as mentioned in many papers. But I this wont work when a person is illuminated by Blue or Red light. Moreover in darkness too it is not giving the result. p  pI also tried using Voila jones HaarCascade for multiple face detection in OpenCV, but it also can not detect a lot of faces in normal light condition. p  pFalse detection throught HaarCascade method can be prevented by keeping a check of skin percentage. And to avoid missing the detection, I tried to find the skin portions first and then apply Voila jones in that region. But this too doesnt work.p  pCan anybody please suggest  what feature am I missing to consider for the face detection in different light conditions  p

Negative 8488 pIm trying to figure out the best way to attach two fixed width divs to a fluid center div. Ive searched around for an answer to this problem but most people require a 3 column layout to fill the entire width of the screen, whereas I would like a variable amount of whitespace either side.p  pThe intention is that the fluid div will wrap around images scaled to a fixed height but variable width. p  pIdeally if the edge of the screen is reached the two fixed divs wont go any further. Could this be done with pure cssa framework or is it easier to use javascript Im using node.js serverside if it helps.p  pRight now Im using inlineblock as a way to make it work, but it seems buggy when using percentage widths.

In reallife usage, you wouldnt want to immediately prompt someone to login        like this, for two reasons        1 JavaScript created popup windows are blocked by most browsers unless they        result from direct interaction from people using the app such as a mouse click        2 it is a bad experience to be continually prompted to login upon page load.       FB.login      else         In this case, the person is not logged into Facebook, so we call the login        function to prompt them to do so. Note that at this stage there is no indication        of whether they are logged into the app. If they arent then theyll see the Login        dialog right after they log in to Facebook.

EG by grouping the zips for an offer into a set I get     1, set[84121, 84101, 58103, 58102 ....]p  pThen grouping the second list by state     UT, set[84121, 84101, .....]p  pSo now I can run a set difference between all 50 states iteratively  So it UT zips  zips for offer 1 is an empty set. I can subtract UT zips from Offer 1 and add UT and so on. So if offer 1 has all zips for UT and AZ and only a few from Washington DC I want to end up with p  precodeoffer, location 1, UT 1, AZ 1, 20011 .... .... codepre  pThen I run the same process iteratively for all cities to up convert the remaining zip codes for every offer.p  pNeedless to say this process is extremely inefficient and does not scale well. I am not sure what a better solution would be.  I have looked into this post a hrefhttpcodingwiththomas.blogspot.com201106setintersectionanddifferencewith.html relnofollowherea and though this method works well for intersecting 2 sets I dont see it fit for my case.

Negative 8488 pThere is a webapp, where every request consumes various external resources. The webapp tracks those consumed resources with request scooped bean. Then HandlerInterceptors afterCompletion method calls TaskExecutor to store this information in DB. All is fine and dandy, but there goes the requirement to add bandwith consumption as another resource. Counting outgoing response size is a typical task for servlet filter along with response wrapper and custom stream implementation. So this is done and is also working.p  pThe problem is that Id like to aggregate two things together. Obviously, I cant pass bytes sent to Spring HandlerInterceptor, because filters doFilter hasnt completed yet and the amount of bytes sent isnt known when the interceptor runs. So filter must be the place to aggregate all the resource usage and start async task to store it in DB. The problem is how can I pass data from HandlerInterceptor to Filter. Ive tried simple request.setAttribute but surprisingly it didnt worked.p  pAs a side note Im aware of request scooped bean lifecycle and at the handler Im creating a simple POJO populated with data from scooped bean.p

I have tried numerous configurations, but it is still difficult to gauge an optimum one.p

Negative 8488 pI believe there will be a relatively simple solution for this, however I am yet to find it.p  pI am creating a simple rdlc report in a visual studio 2012 windows forms application, adding a dataset and dragging and dropping these fields into my tablix. All this worked fine, however I now want to add a tablix inside one of my row fields. I want it to look like the image below, and I want to do it fairly painlessly through the designer.img srchttpi.stack.imgur.commYDbP.png altenter image description herep  pAbove is an exmaple of the table I am trying to create, with all contained fields in the same row of the same dataset with the Date, Start, and End fields being the problem areas I cannot create.p  pI have tried to create these, however I get the errorp  pThe tablix Tablix1 has a detail member with inner members. Detail members can only contain static inner members.p  pAfter this I deleted some groups, and it compiled, however it then only showed the first line of data from the datatset.p  pI also wondered whether there may be a way to move the tablix headers from rows to columns, so the headers go down the left instead of across the top, but I cannot seem to find a way to do this either.p  pI am fairly new to this so any help is much appreciated.p  pThanks.p

Negative 8488 pUsually I use Mathematica, but now trying to shift to python, so this question might be a trivial one, so I am sorry about that. p  pAnyways, is there any builtin function in python which is similar to the function named strongInterval[min,max]strong in Mathematica  link is  a hrefhttpreference.wolfram.comlanguagerefInterval.html relnofollowhttpreference.wolfram.comlanguagerefInterval.htmla p  pWhat I am trying to do is, I have a function and I am trying to minimize it, but it is a constrained minimization, by that I mean, the parameters of the function are only allowed within some particular interval. p  pFor a very simple example, lets say strongfxstrong is a function with parameter strongxstrong and I am looking for the value of strongxstrong which minimizes the function but strongxstrong is constrained within an interval strongmin,maxstrong . [ Obviously the actual problem is just not onedimensional rather multidimensional optimization, so different paramters may have different intervals. ]p  pSince it is an optimization problem, so ofcourse I do not want to pick the paramter randomly from an interval. p  pAny help will be highly appreciated , thanks p

That works, but it is not a very nice pattern, and methods in the interface are growing again and again, and even if I created an Adapter, that makes too many methods a game must implement.pli lipSecondly, I so decided to use strongeventsstrong to make the interface lighter, and a game can listen to some event triggered by the core.pli ul  pThat works too, and it is a good pattern, but another inconvenient comes to mep  pEvery game listen to a same event, so if a player creates a game instance of any game then the core dispatch the event codeevent.game.createdcode, every game is notified.p  pI can add a condition in every game listener method like codeif game.name  chess returncodep  pBut I have too many game, and that makes too many methods called for nothing, for every event...p  pThat is why I returned to the first method, call an interface method, then I am sure that the method of the good game bundle is called, and not all games methods when core notifies a game instance creation or any other event.p  pstrongAn inconvenient stays againstrongp  pI have many games, then many game bundles that are booted for nothing, because only core bundle and maybe one game bundle are used in a query.p  pDo you have some ideas or the same problem p
Negative 8488 pI have two Viewmodels, a view and two partial views and a controller method for submit. Lets name them, BigViewModel, SmallViewModel, Page.cshtml, Options.cshtml, Submit.cshtml and SubmitBigViewModel method in controller.p  pSmallViewModel is included in BigViewModel as one of the properties.p  plike, p  precodepublic class BigViewModel      public bool Confirm  get set      public SmallViewModel s  get set   codepre  pNow, Page.cshtml has a division where Options.cshtml resides where user can input few options like sorting, searching etc. This Options.cshtml uses a viewmodel called SmallViewModel. When you click on Submit button which is on Options.cshtml partial view, it opens a dialog box that is Submit.cshtml which asks for confirmation and submit button. This confirmation information is stored in BigViewModel. Now, when I hot submit it goes to SubmitBigViewModel method in the controller.p  pMy problem is how to include SmallViewModel data into BigViewModel from Submit.cshtml partial view page. Because, when I go to the SubmitBigViewModel method, I only see Confirm  TrueFalse. But smallViewModel is null. p  pHope, question is clear enough. I didnt know how else to ask. Please help.p

Negative 8488 pDear Javascript programmers,p  pGoogles Closure Library is always good for driving people crazy. I hope you can help me on this issuep  pI want to catch the codeondevicemotioncodeEvent by javascript within a function within the Closure lib. Without Closure everything works fine with the following code which I grabbed from this page thanks to the author a hrefhttpwww.peterfriese.dehowtousethegyroscopeofyouriphoneinamobilewebapp relnofollowhttpwww.peterfriese.dehowtousethegyroscopeofyouriphoneinamobilewebappap  pThe following snippet shows my codep  precodeif window.DeviceMotionEvent  undefined      console.logDME     window.ondevicemotion  functione      console.logODM       handle events like e.rotationRate     ...       codepre  pThis works perfectly in a standalone html page. Both codeconsole.logcodes are triggered.p  pIn contrast, Closure seems to have a problem with codewindow.ondevicemotion  functione code because the console logs DME but not ODM. There are no compiler warnings or errors.p  pHas anybody recognized such a problem, too I sadly have no idea why Closure acts so stupid more probably strongemIemstrong am so stupid. p  pThanks for reading Any help appreciatedp
Negative 8488 pIm working on a proof of concept for using GraphDBs specifically Titan 0.4.4 on HBase. For that I  created a relatively simple graph I have companies that buy and sell products. A sale is associated with a department of the buyerp  precodebuyer name BUYS departmentIdgt product name ltSELLS seller name codepre  pI filled the graph with 1000 buyers and sellers each as well as 1 million products. Each product is sold by exactly one company and bought by randomly chosen 1 to 5 departments of 1 to 6 companies. So I roughly end up with 1 million vertices and 11.5 million edges.p  pNow I want to query the graph for the following Return all products which name matches a given substring S bought by department D of company with name C, which I implemented like suchp  pGet start vertexp  precodestartgraph.query.hasname, C.vertices codepre  pwhich due to the vertex index I created returns relatively quickly after warmup lt 1ms. Now to get the respective products I run thisp  precodenew GremlinPipelinestart.outEBUYS.hasdepartmentId, D      .inV.hasname, new LowerCaseContainsPredicate, P .toList codepre  pThe response time for this against an HBase backend 10 m3.xlarge nodes on AWS EMR was incredibly long, with a single consumer averaging at about 1.5s per query I picked random buyers, departments and product names and iterated 1000x, which returns around 260 product records. In order to take a possibly faulty HBase configuration out of the equation I ran it against a local BerkelyDB 4 CPUs, 8 GB VM memory, 16 GB total memory.p  pThis sped up the queries of course, returning in  160ms for a single threaded application, which is not really a race car but still acceptable. Adding more parallel requests resulted in a quick degradation of response times, 10 parallel requests came in at avg 1.2s.p  pSo I ran a comparison with Neo4j 2.1.3 using this Cypher queryp  precodestart buyernodecompanynameC match buyer[BUYS departmentIdD]gtproduct  where product.name  i.P. return product codepre  pwhich returns much faster 46x depending on number of parallel requests,  50ms for single thread, 270ms for 10 in parallel. Now there is a Blueprints implementation for Neo4j so I tried that as well to find out if its the DB engine or the way I query that makes the difference.p  pTurns out that running Gremlin queries against Neo4j is about as slow as running it against Titan  in fact its even slightly slower.p  pAll tests were run as a Java application in a single VM with embedded graph DBs to avoid any networking impact. I also noticed that the very first query always takes a lot longer, so the application ran a random query first before starting the benchmark. The code is pure Java using the GremlinePipeline Java class, the snippet above is literally the Java code it is running except for the predicate, which is only instantiated once. Cypher queries were run by using a parameterized constant query string and passing in the respective parameter map.p  pThis is the first time Im using a graph DB so Im wondering if Im doing something fundamentally wrong with the Gremlin query or if BlueprintsGremlin is just inherently slow.p

Negative 8488 pNOTE Although this question refers to a spreadsheet to solve the problem, I am also open to using PHP or Javascriptp  pI have a spreadsheet for forecasting my personal financial budget for the next 3 years. The goal is to pay as much as possible on the highest priority debt until it is paid off and then the next debt in priority begins to receive all extra monthly funds until it is paid and so on. I want the debt payments to auto calculate their payments, but I run into a circular reference error since computing the debt payment requires considering the debt balance which is computed using the debt payment. In addition the net income and thus checking balance use the debt payments to derive their values so it makes another circular reference when trying to self compute the debt payment.p  pIs there a financial function that can compute the maximum possible payment without referencing the debt balance Something that takes a starting balance and interest rate and looks at the sum of payments already made I think I can get around the Checking Balance circular reference.p  pBelow is a sample of my spreadsheet.

Negative 8488 pWe have a web application that receives incoming data via RESTful web services running on JerseyTomcatApachePostgreSQL. Separately from this webservice application, we have a number of repeating and scheduled tasks that need to be carried out. For example, purging different types of data at different intervals, pulling data from external systems on varying schedules, and generating reports on specified days and times.p  pSo, after reading up on Quartz Scheduler, I see that it seems like a great fit.p  pMy question is should I design my Quartzbased scheduling application to run in Tomcat via QuartzInitializerListener, or build it into a standalone application to run as a linux daemon e.g., via Apache Commons Daemon or the Tanuk Java Service Wrapper.p  pOn the one hand, it strikes me as counterintuitive to use Tomcat to host an application that is not geared towards receiving http calls. On the other hand, I havent used Apache Commons Daemon or the Java Service Wrapper before, so maybe running inside Tomcat is the path of least resistance.p  pAre there any significant benefits or dangers with either approach that I should be aware of Our core modules already take care of data access, logging, etc., so I dont see that those services are much of a factor either way.p  pOur scheduling will be data driven, so our Quartzbased scheduler will read the relevant data from PostgreSQL. However, if we run the scheduling application within Tomcat, is it possiblereasonable to send messages to our application via http calls to Tomcat Finally, fwiw, since our jobs will be driven by our existing application data, I dont see any need for the Quartz JDBCJobStore.p

Negative 8488 pI am currently trying to parse dates and times to convert them to milliseconds from epoch.p  pFor this purpose I am using SimpleDateFormat for parsing with code like thisp  precodepublic static long parseDateString date     Parse   SimpleDateFormat format  new SimpleDateFormatyyyyMMdd, Locale.US   Date parsedDate  format.parsedate     Get milliseconds   Calendar cal  new GregorianCalendar   cal.setTimeparsedDate   return cal.getTimeInMillis  codepre  pPlaying around I discovered that SimpleDateFormat does allow parsing of 19700000 which is parsed as 19691130. Thinking about it, it completely makes sense. When the parser just sums everything so that 1969 is actually understood as 19691130 and with 0 monts a yearoverflow does not happen. Unfortunately, I does not change anything that this date is not valid at least as I understand dates.p  pIs there a way to add validitation by not using thirdparty libs or java 8 target is Android or do have to stick with regex and validation by handp  pThank you in advancep

Negative 8488 pWe have a database project with views which join to tables in another database.  The other database is in a different solution.

Negative 8488 pIn our WPF app we have one Main Window and a bunch of buttons that open popup EditReadOnly Windows. In the Main Window we also have a ContentControl that gives notifications in the bottom right corner.p  pWhat I want to achieve is to have these notifications popup in the very front of all Windows. I know I can use codePanel.ZIndexcode to make it the front ViewElement inside the Main Window itself, but Id also want it on top of the popup Windows that might be in front of it.p  pIs there a way to achieve this I know I could put this ContentControl with Notifications inside a seperate Window instead of the MainWindow itself, but then Id had to remove the borders and bar of the Window, remove it from the Windows Taskbar at the bottom and a bunch of other stuff to make it lookact the same as it is right now, which I preferably avoid.p  pSo, what is the best way to approach this and is it even possible without putting it in a seperate Window, and have that pop up in front of every other window every time a new Notifications comes upp

Negative 8488 pNot sure if this is a good SO question. Please advise if not.p  pSo, Ive had Apache2.2 and some local sites set up for a really long time. Suddenly, they dont want to load. I get spinning wheels and EVENTUALLY they load but, I would think localhost should load pretty quickly. They always used to.p  pThe only change Ive made recently is that, last week, I started rewritingredesigning one of the sites. I wanted to make sure I was working with a certain codebase, so I actually moved the code out of the root directory, hit it in the browser, saw it was nonexistent, put the new code in and reloaded the browser. It took longer than expected to load stuff up but then it got moving and I continued coding and seeing changes as expected, etc.p  pThen, I shut down last night since I was away. I started up the machine tonight and have been having these issues all night  on ALL the locally hosted sitesp  pIve restarted Apache a couple times and it hasnt helped much. My Task Manager claims Im at over 40 with Firefox eating up nearly 300MB of memory.p  pAll external sites are loading just fine.p  pThoughts as to what might be causing this and where to look nextp  pThanksp  pEDIT Im noticing that its taking the images longer to load than the text. Semiexpected, but figured Id mention it in case it helps.p

Negative 8488 pIve been searching all over for this and Im surprised I havent found it yet.p  pIm using Windows 7. Ive got TortoiseSVN 1.8 with command line tools available but if there is a solution using another client that will work, Im open to other options.p  pIm trying to reset the cached auths for a specific repository on an svn client.p  pIve have a group of projects 15 that get built all together.  We have setup batch files using the svn command line client to checkout and build the projects which work great on the individual developers machine since the svn client caches their credentials.p  pHowever, we are setting up a central build machine for releases instead of having one person responsible for release builds and we would like for anyone to be able to login and run a build using their own credentials.p  pThe problem we have is that if we leave the svn client using its default settings, then anyone logging into the machine will use the previous persons credentials.  If we switch the svn client to not cache credentials, then the build process its all scripted remember has to prompt for every project which results in the user typing their password 15 times just to do a build.p  pWe are part of a large company and our svn server houses a lot of different repos for other teams and some developers use multiple repos so I cannot simply clear the cache directory after the build because that would wipe out all cached repos instead of just ours as far as I can tell, svn only caches by server, not by repo.p  pIs there any solution I can implement that will prompt for svn credentials on the first project that gets pulled from svn in the batch file, uses those credentials for all projects in the script but then clears the cached credentials for only those projects or the whole repo when the script finishesp  pIve tried several different method to try and reset the credentials for a specific project but I am not having any luck.  Even if my script has to go reset them individually, that would be ok.p  pSomeone on another so thread suggested using svn switch on the project and providing a different user via username when done but that doesnt seem to work on windows they were using OSX.

Negative 8488 pI would like to branch and decide on a Trait implementation to use within a function at runtime see codepolyreadcode in the code sample below. The trait object is constructed inside of the branch arms of an if expression and only needs to live for the life of codepolyreadcode yet I need to codeBoxcode it because the trait cant be borrowed from within the expression arm, up to the binding that Im attempting to assign it to.p  pI understand logically why the borrow ends too early, but it seems like the borrow checker should be able to extend the borrow up to the surrounding scope when the if expressions value is bound. I realize this is probably a naive notion, but Id like to understand more about why its not possible.p  pIm a bit unhappy with the solution I have now because it requires a heap allocation even though I feel like I shouldnt need one, since I only hold onto the box for the life of the function. I suppose this is because we dont know the size of codereadercode that would be required on the stack until the branch is taken, but couldnt it just be represented as a union in the compiler, since we at least know the maximum size.p  pAs an aside, I actually dont know how valid my concern about the codeBoxcode being heap allocated is to begin with.

Negative 8488 pOne would think it would be essential for a VoIP app to obey the same rules as the stock phone app but it turns out to be almost impossible to implement ringing correctly. Several things I triedp  ol lipLocal push notifications with ring sound.p  pstrongGoodstrong obeys both Silent and DND modes.p  pstrongBadstrong the sound can be no longer than 30 seconds, and it only vibrates once when the notification appears. So to achieve the ringing effect the notification has to be repushed e.g. every 6 seconds, effectively spamming the notification center. Also push notifications do not soundvibrate if the app is active so the app has to detect that and ring differently.pli lipcodeAudioServicesPlayAlertSoundcode.p  pstrongGoodstrong proper API seemingly designed specifically for this task.

Negative 8488 pI am researching ways to automate the creation of a Linux development environment.  I use packer to build a VirtualBox image, and ansible to provision the machine.p  pMy question is this is it possible to use ansible to generate an Eclipse workspace and an arbitrary number of projects in that workspace based on a list of github repos  Put another way, Id like to give ansible a list of github repos, and on provision have it clone them already doable and easy to understand and set up Eclipse projects such that when a developer sits down to my newly built and provisioned VM, heshe can open Eclipse and start working on any of the repos almost instantlyp  pIve seen numerous examples of how to get Eclipse installed using ansible, and Ive already got that working properly.  I just cant figure out how to go the extra mile and get the dev environment set up automatically.p

Negative 8488 pCan please summarize the eventssteps that happen when I try to execute a readwrite system call. How does the kernel know which file system to issue these commands.p  pLets say a process calls write. Then It will call syswrite. p  pNow probably, since syswrite is executed on behalf of the current process, it can access the strongstruct taskstructstrong and hence it can access the strongstruct filesstructstrong and strongstruct fsstructstrong which contains file system information.p  pBut after that I am not seeing, how this strongfsstructstrong is helping to identify the file system.p  pEdit Now that Alex has described the flow...I have still doubt how the readwrite are getting routed to a FS, since the VFS does not do it, then it must be happening somewhere else, Also how is the underlying block device and then finally the hardware protocol PCIUSB getting attached.p  pA simple flow chart involving actual data structures would be helpfulp  pPlease help.p

Negative 8488 pI had a table that nearly reached 20 columns. p  pI find each one necessary since its a project table, and the project has columns that indicate stuff such as when it was created, when it was updated, its id, who started it, who finished it, some metadata such as keywords, the content of the project itself, a brief description and some other stuff. p  pI was happy with my table, but then I browsed some questions through stackoverflow and saw stuff like emyour table should never have more than 10 columnsem and suggestions that if it was the case, you should split your table into smaller ones.p  pFollowing StackOverflows advice, I split my table into two tables, but Im finding it more complicated to manipulate. Now, when each project is created, I have to create two new records, each one for each table. I have to handle errors on the creation of either record, which means that if the creation of the record on the second table fails, I have to do emyetem another query to rollback the creation of the first record. Data retrieval and record deletion has also been made more complex, since now I have to do that on two tables.p  pIm using the Sails.js framework, and trying to use associations, but I find that its pretty much the same, I still have to repeat tasks for each table.p  pstrongIs it really worth it to split your table into smaller ones if it gets that big Or should I just keep my 20 column tablestrong My project is new, not even online, so I dont know performance.

Negative 8488 pIve got a rather large PHP web app which gets its products from numerous others suppliers through their APIs, usually responding with a large XML to parse. Currently there are 20 suppliers but this is due to rise even further. p  pOur current set up uses multi curl to make the requests and this takes about 3040 seconds to complete and is too long. The script runs in the background whilst the front end polls the database looking for results and then displays them as they come in.p  pTo improve this process we were thinking of using a job server to run in the background, each supplier request being a separate job. Weve seen beanstalkd and Gearman being mentioned.p  pSo are we looking in the right direction, as in, is a job server the right way to go Were looking at doing some promotion soon so we may get 200 users searching 30 suppliers at the same time so the right choice needs to scale well if we have to load balance.p  pAny advice is great fully received.p

Negative 8488 pHow should I store the codepointercodes returned from codemalloccode I have a small parser that allows nested codeincludecodes in the source files, meaning the first source file can include codefoocode, then codefoocode can include codebarcode and so on. p  pThis feature forces me to keep the memory allocated to each file intact, while opening new files  therefore allocating new bunch of memory, and keep parsing them until the last file is opened and the last line is parsed, and then I can start codefreecodeing up the memory from the very last opened file.p  pThe first thing came to my mind was to implementing a emStackem to keep track of the allocated memory. As Im doing this for the purpose of learning codeCcode, I started reading up how can I store returned pointers from codemalloccode, however there is so much noise around similar topics like how to cast codemalloccode that I couldnt find anything helpful.p  pThen I checked the codemalloccode documentation and it says that codemalloccode returns codevoidcode pointers, but as far as I know it is generally not recommended to use void pointers as you cant dereference void pointers.p  pI dont think I need to dereference codemalloccode pointers, since I will only need to pass them to the codefreecode and I shall be fine, however I was wondering if there are any wellknown solutions regarding properly storing these pointers in my stack p  pThe goal is simply to keep track of the allocated memory via stack, so at any moment the pointer to the most recent allocated memory can be popedout and freed when needed.p

Path tickets[0].customer.Merchant.Addresses[0].p blockquote  pI know that each Address object has a Merchant property that points back to the Merchant and causes the loop.p  pI have read that codeRefenceLoopHandling.Ignorecode is supposed to just ignore the references, after the initial one, and not serialize them and all should work, but what happens when I do that is I get an infinite loop and my worker process grows to the size of my physical memory and I have to kill it.p  pUsing codePreserveReferencesHandling  PreserveReferencesHandling.Objectscode instead of the code.Ignorecode does work to return all the objects and their references, but I have an iOS app that I assume will not be able to convert that JSON because I have read that you need to deserialize with json.net for this to work.p  pI dont want to hard code any codejsonIgnorecode attributes on the property collections because there are times when I need that collection populated, like when I am returning a list of addresses and I want their Merchant property populated.p  ol liWhy isnt code.Ignorecode working as all the other posts on the topic suggestli liIf I have to stick with codePreserveReferencesHandling.Objectscode, how would the iOS app be able to use this JSON formatli ol

Negative 8488 pCan anybody of the Java EE crowd tell me, what were the reasons in those days to make the validation more lenient and dont fail on erroneous XMLsp  pFound a description in the docs, but no background information...p  blockquote   pSince unmarshalling invalid XML content is defined in JAXB 2.0, the Unmarshaller default validation event handler was made more lenient than in JAXB 1.0. When schemaderived code generated by JAXB 1.0 binding compiler is registered with JAXBContext, the default unmarshal validation handler is DefaultValidationEventHandler and it terminates the marshal operation after encountering either a fatal error or an error. For a JAXB 2.0 client application, there is no explicitly defined default validation handler and the default event handling only terminates the unmarshal operation after encountering a fatal error.  a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavaee7apijavaxxmlbindUnmarshaller.html relnofollowfrom Interface Unmarshallerap blockquote  pstrongEDITstrongbr Ill provide an example..p  precodeUnmarshaller unmarshaller  getJaxbContextpackages.createUnmarshaller  sets event handler to DefaultValidationEventHandler    error and fatal error lead to an exception  DefaultValidationEventHandler is not default by default anymore unmarshaller.setEventHandlernull Object o  unmarshaller.unmarshalfile codepre  pThis is the rt 1.7.060 implementation of the Setter calledp  precode   Allow an application to register a validation event handler.   ltpgt   The validation event handler will be called by the JAXB Provider if any   validation errors are encountered during calls to any of the   ltttgtunmarshalltttgt methods.

For instance p  pwhat is the correct relationship between Books and Tags where a Book will have many Tags but Tags will not be unique to each book or owned A Tag would be a collection consisting of name, id fields. Is it absolutely necessary to have a BookTag Associations collection with bookid and tagid p  pWhat if I want to use that Tag with another collection, such as Magazines  would I need another through association with a MagazineTag Associations collection or is there a more elegant and less repetitive way of accomplishing thisp  pHere is an example Gist a hrefhttpsgist.github.comononotofucb268fd3c5d8b37da376 relnofollowhttpsgist.github.comononotofucb268fd3c5d8b37da376a  Im certain theres something fundamentally wrong about my approach but cant quite place it.

What Im not sure of is that when Im disposing off myInterface explicitly in the finally block of my C code then shall I explicitly dispose off myInteface.MyPathDiciotnary[key] as well because if I already disposed off myInterface then an invocation of MyPathDictionary[key] on it myInterface should automatically be disposed off.p  pAny suggestions regarding this conundrum will be appreciated.p

Negative 8488 pIm making a JCL logging bridge that operates over several lets say two logging implementations like log4j. Depending on configuration of all these implementations the bridge than makes custom global decision whether to log and than logs to all or none of the underlying implementations.p  pLogging implementations usually have methods like thisp  ul lipublic codeisLevelEnabledcode to test loggabilityli lipublic codelogLevelmsgcode which use the test methods and eventually logs messages via li liprotected codelogInternallvl, msgcode which logs without additional testsli ul  pNow since I make custom decision if level is enabled, I cannot use the public log methods that make the standard decision and I need to use the protected method directly.p  pI know, that I can access the protected members from the same package so I added an intruder class with the same package as the logger class of target implementationp  pre classlangjava prettyprintoverridecodepackage com.log.lib  logging library logger in dependency jar public class Logger    protected void logInternalint lvl, String msg     library logging without additional level testing     codepre  pre classlangjava prettyprintoverridecodepackage com.log.lib  my class to access protected method of library logger public class LoggerAccessor    public void logLogger logger, int lvl, String msg      logger.logInternallvl, msg     codepre  pThis worked fined until I ran the code on an application server which provides one of the logging implementations loaded by different classloader than my application. I got an codeIllegalAccessExceptioncode. So this is how I learned about strongruntime packagestrongs e.g. a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma33875204222213quick explanation herea.p  pI can invoke the method via reflection by granting accessibility and I even have an automatic test of runtime package and select between direct invocation and reflection. But the reflection is always used on the application server where the application runs. And since logging is an extensively used activity the reflection is kind of bottleneck here.p  pstrongSo I askstrong Is there a better faster way to invoke the protected method from different runtime package or to log e.g. via log4j without its decision makingp

Negative 8488 pAlright so I want to know if doing this would affect the code, and if Im doing it correctly.p  pSo basically, lets say in one file I have a dictionary called commands inside a class, and in another an object of the other class is made, and the dictionary is used. During runtime, I edit the dictionary and add new functions. Now I need to reload the dictionary without having to restart the whole script because this would affect a lot of people using my services. If I send a signal to the script its a socket server that indicates that the dictionary should be reloaded. How would I reimport the module after its already imported midcode and would reimporting it affect the objects made of it, or do I have to somehow reload the objects note that the objects contain an active socket, and I do not wish to kill that socket.p

Negative 8488 pI want to have emnem for now only two, but I will need more mostbottom windows but preventing them to be covered by other mostbottom windows which were created before.p  pSo, lets suppose we have 3 windows like this, created in this orderp  ul liAli liBli liCli ul  pcodeAcode will cannot cover codeBcode or codeCcode. codeBcode will cover only codeAcode, but not codeCcode. codeCcode will cover codeAcode and codeBcode and will emnotem get covered by any of the previous created windows codeAcode or codeBcode.p  hr  pTo create the windows I used a hrefhttpsgithub.comatomelectronElectronJS former atomshella and did the followingp  precodevar App  requireapp   , BrowserWindow  requirebrowserwindow     var mainWindow  null  ...  App.onready, function      mainWindow  new BrowserWindow         width 100       , height 50       , resizable false       , frame false       , type desktop          mainWindow.loadUrlfile  dirname  ..index.html     ...  codepre  pcodetype desktopcode will accomplish what I want, but only for one window. If I start another window like this could be the same application, started twice, for example, they will be always on bottom, but the first window can cover the second window, which I dont want to happen since codeBcode should not be covered by codeAcode.p  pIs it possible to do this under x11 I was looking at a hrefhttpsgithub.comsidoraresnodex11codenodex11codea and I saw a hrefhttpstandards.freedesktop.orgwmspec1.3ar01s05.htmlthere is a window propertya to set the desktop type I wonder if Electron does the same or not codeNETWMWINDOWTYPEATOM  NETWMWINDOWTYPEDESKTOPcode.p  pOr is there any other known solution for this casep
Negative 8488 pIm currently writing a small program in C on a Mac, and with some C code in it and need to retrieve binary data from a socket which works well, but I also need to cut off the HTTP header.p  pSo basically, I connect to a server, send a HTTP GET request, and get a HTTP 200 standard header followed by the binary data. I do only need the binary data and the ContentLength field of the header.p  pMy function so farp  precodevoid readbinarydatassizet len,long long remaindata, FILE fd, int sock      char buffer[BUFSIZ]      int checker  0     int currposition  0      while len  recvsock, buffer, BUFSIZ, 0 gt 0 ampamp remaindata gt 0           ifchecker  4 gt http header until currposition1, data starts at currposition2         forchar pointer  buffer currposition lt len  pointer              ifpointer  r  pointer  n                 checker                          else                 checker  0                           ifchecker  4                 break                          currposition                  fwritebuffer, sizeofchar, len, fd         remaindata  len       codepre  pI would initially pass remaindata  999 just to get into the while loop and yes I need some error handling there but thats not the problem at the moment.p  pNow the codeforcode loop should check for the rnrn at the end of a HTTP header would I get it like thatp  pAnd then, how could I copy the binary data from buffer to another buffer to write it with fwrite to a file without the HTTP headerp  pThat would be sufficient for me, but I thought I could also try to rerun this function with the extracted ContentLength information to fill remaindata.. guess thats not needed anymore after the while loop is completed.p  pBut then again, can the coderecvcode function return lt 0 even if theres still data left to readp  pstrongSo to concludestrongp  ul liis my codeforcode loop correctli lihow can I cut the HTTP header from bufferli lican I safely delete the ampamp remaindata  0li ul
