Then I have an interceptor to check if the user is authenticated when a Call is made.

Positive 1201 pWe are working on a website with a static frontend, API Gateway  Lambda as the backend, DynamoDB as the DB. I saw there were a couple similar questions to this one, but Im looking to understand the matter throughly to build a complete and robust solutions, since I hope to build several websites using this stack.p  pThis one is a fairly basic website we have an codeindex.htmlcode page, a codeblog.htmlcode page and a codeportfolio.htmlcode page. We also have an html page for single portfolio entries lets call it codeportfolioentry.htmlcode and a page for single blog articles lets call it codeblogpost.htmlcode.p  pSo I see theres a way to specify an index page and an error page, so you can have a nice clean url for your index. There are also rewrite rules, which are more like redirects.p  pI guess my best bet to deliver different blog posts would be to pass a query string to codeblogpost.htmlcode mywebsite.comblogpost.htmlpostpostalias and have the code.jscode ask the API different content depending on the query string.p  pIs there a way using S3 to route codemywebsite.comblogpostaliascode to codemywebsite.comblogpost.htmlpostpostaliascode and pass the response to the client without redirecting Im both interested in clientside url rewriting via JS to have nice URLs for humans AND serverside routing to catch crawler requests and have SEOindexing of pages for specific posts, for example.p  pHow should I go about this Is there a way to achieve all this using what S3 and JS provide or do I have to put a proxyrouter like nginx in front of S3 to handle route requestsp  pWe are really committed to the whole S3ApiGatewayLambdaDynamo architecture and we would really love to do without server.p

Positive 1201 pim trying to create a virtual testing environment. for purpose of testing, im going to send udp packets to application running inside the virtual machine. i want to control source ip of the packet when it is received by the application.p  pi tried different vagrant configurationsp  precodeconfig.vm.network forwardedport, guest 1111, host 11111, adapter 2 codepre  porp  precodeconfig.vm.network forwardedport, guest 1111, host 11111, hostip x.x.x.x codepre  pbut no success.p  pit seems to me that this can not be solved by Vagrant alone. unfortunately, im completely unfamiliar with iptablesroute.p  plet me explain the problem in greater detail ideal scenario is to be able to send this from within virtual environment itself  application is listening on some port P. then test script sends data to host1port1 and it comes through one interface and application sees its source ip as 1.1.1.1, and when script sends packets to host2port2, application sees it as though its coming from 2.2.2.2.p  pkeeping it inside virtual environment is good because i can use just the image across QA local machines and build servers, as it will contain everything.p  pif this configuration is not possible though i dont see why, configuring virtual box to have 2 or more ports forwarded via different interfaces, so that sending packets to them results in different source addresses.p

Positive 1201 pIm trying to introduce a version rollback within my .net web api application.p  pRight now Im using RoutePrefixs on classes to define the version like sop  precode[RoutePrefixapiv1] public class SomeController  codepre  pSomeController has some api endpoints on itp  pNow Ive written a custom ControllerSelector, which handles the rollback so that if someone requests apiv2... it looks to see if v2 exists, and if it doesnt it looks for v1, etc.p  pI havent been able to even test this though, because something blocks the routes prior to the call to ControllerSelector.  Its like .NET realizes what routes exist prior to calling the ControllerSelector, and decides not to call ControllerSelector because it doesnt think we want to handle the route.  It results in a 404.p  pIs there anyway for me to make routes get passed through properly to the ControllerSelector even if there are no controller classes that use RoutePrefixs and Route attributes to explicitly define those routesp  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comDUlX5.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comDUlX5.png alterror responseap

Negative 1201 pBefore I start here, I am using C.  I would like to do some transforms using the ColorMatrix class.  The problem is that sometimes an overflow occurs for r, g, or b.  Instead of clamping the value at 255, the matrix loops around and starts again at 0.  This means that, for images which should appear all white, they begin to turn black again.  I am using this to model intensity over different line rates for line scan cameras.  Does anyone know of a way to get around thisp  pBTW, I do have other other methods in mind, and I could do the matrix transforms myself, but I am more interested in a solution to this specific problem if there is one of course.p

Negative 1201 pIts a very common scenario some process wants to drop a file on a server every 30 minutes or so.  Simple, right  Well, I can think of a bunch of ways this could go wrong.p  pFor instance, processing a file may take more or less than 30 minutes, so its possible for a new file to arrive before Im done with the previous one. I dont want the source system to overwrite a file that Im still processing.p  pOn the other hand, the files are large, so it takes a few minutes to finish uploading them. I dont want to start processing a partial file.  The files are just tranferred with FTP or sftp my preference, so OSlevel locking isnt an option.p  pFinally, I do need to keep the files around for a while, in case I need to manually inspect one of them for debugging or reprocess one.p  pIve seen a lot of adhoc approaches to shuffling upload files around, swapping filenames, using datestamps, touching indicator files to assist in synchronization, and so on.  What I havent seen yet is a comprehensive algorithm for processing files that addresses concurrency, consistency, and completeness.  p  pSo, Id like to tap into the wisdom of crowds here.  Has anyone seen a really bulletproof way to juggle batch data files so theyre never processed too early, never overwritten before done, and safely kept after processingp

Negative 1201 pTo illustrate the Q. Ill really oversimplify the example in reality the code is much more convoluted.p  pSay you have a flex control, which underneath contains a datagrid. Something likep  precodeltmxDataGrid idgrid dataProviderdocument.itemsgt     ltmxcolumnsgt     ltmxDataGridColumn headerTextColumn 1 dataFieldnamegt     ltmxDataGridColumn headerTextColumn 2 dataFieldvaluegt     ltmxcolumnsgt ltmxDataGridgt codepre  pWhere document is a Model object, containing some data. You provide a selection setter on the control, as the clients dont want to know anything about the underlying datamodel p  precodepublic function set selectedItemtitleStringAllocation     grid.selectedItem   null     for eachvar oObject in grid.dataProvider           var tString  o.title       if t  title                  grid.selectedItem  o          return             codepre  pSo far, so good. Provided document.items is prepopulated, the selection will work correctly. However. What to do if you already know, at the emstartupem of the application, what the selection ought to be  its been passed for example on the URL So, in the flex you might have something likep  precode Initialising now... mycontrol.document  this.document  give the control the document   Fetch titles new FetchTitlesEvent.dispatch  cairngormstyle event   Set the selection  mycontrol.selectedItem  Application.application.parameters.title codepre  pstrongOOpsstrong. Because FetchTitlesEvent operates asynchronously, at the time mycontrol.selectedItem is unable to work. Somehow we need to retrigger that code to set the selection on the control. Now, theres several ways I can think to do this, but all have code smell stenchesp  p1 Do it in the FetchTitlesCommand, after the fetch has been completed   This pollutes the command with knowledge of the view or views that need to know this. Feels like a maintenance nightmare waiting to happen, and means the views are totally bound to commands, and those commands arent reusable. Blech.p  p2 Have a callback from the event when its complete that does it either make some composite command that starts in FetchTitlesEvent and ends in a new command to do the set. Seems fragile to me  how does the maintainer know emwhichem callbacks are neccesarily required And its still binding UI control knowledge into commands. Badness.p  p3 Have some kind of timer, waiting for the event queue to have been quiescent for a number of seconds. Hackity hackhack.p  p4 Do it in the control. Bind to the collectionevents in mycontrol on document.items, monitor for changes. Once the row arrives that matches the selection, select it, and stop monitoring for changes.   Control feels the right place to do it   collection events sometimes throw exciting CHANGE or REFRESH events though   seems an expensive monitor to have lying aroundp  pIm pretty much leaning to 4. Are there any other options that flexers have used before to trap this issue  particularly are there any codified into libraries that I might use, as it must be a fairly generalpurpose problemp

Negative 1201 pIve done a lot of programming but not much in C, and I need advice on debugging.  I have a static variable file scope that is being clobbered after about 10100 seconds of execution of a multithreaded program using pthreads on OS X 10.4.  My code looks something like thisp  precodestatic float somevalues[SIZE] static int  addr codepre  pcodeaddrcode points to valid memory address for a while, and then gets clobbered with some value sometimes 0, sometimes nonzero, thereby causing a segfault when dereferenced.  Poking around with codegdbcode I have verified that codeaddrcode is being layed out in memory immediately after codesomevaluescode as one would expect, so my first guess would be that I have used an outofbounds index to write to codesomevaluescode.  However, this is a tiny file, so it is easy to check this is not the problem.p  pThe obvious debugging technique would be to set a watchpoint on the variable codeaddrcode.  But doing so seems to create erratic and inexplicable behavior in codegdbcode.  The watchpoint gets triggered at the first assignment to codeaddrcode then after I continue execution, I immediately get a nonsensical segfault in another thread...supposedly a segfault on accessing the address of a static variable in a different part of the program  But then codegdbcode lets me read from and write to that memory address interactively.p  pre Program received signal EXCBADACCESS, Could not access memory.

Negative 1201 pHey guys, I want to store a categorized list of URLs. This is an internet radio streaming app, and so I want to have at least three links for each genrep  ul lithe free streaming URL with commercialsli lithe premium streaming URL at 128 kbpsli lithe premium streaming URL at 256 kbpsli ul  pSo every genre will have these three URLs.p  pFor the premium streams, there are also geolocalized streaming URLs, or mirrors, for specific global areas. For example if I am in the United States, I can choose a closest location of the available mirrors for potentially better streaming qualityreliability.p  pThese URLs can, though I doubt often, change, and so I will want to be able to update them, meaning the storage cant be read only. I dont know exactly how I should store the information, let alone in what type of storage sqlite db, XML, or property lists. Im new to all of this so Im sorry if any of those is stupid for this situation, heh.p  pAs for the structure, Im not sure how to accomplish that either. I can possibly have separate filesdatabases, whatever I end up using, for each location, or I could have one big one that is something likep  ul liRockli ul liLos Angelesli ul liFree streamli liPremium Stream  128kbpsli liPremium Stream  256kbpsli ul  pul ulp  pBut I figure the databasefile would quickly become huge.p  pI guess I can also have separate filesdatabases for the free and premium streams, given that premium users most likely will only want to listen to premium streams emBut still have the option of the 128kbps or 256kbps stream, depending on their network reliabilityem. I could then have an option in the settings as to which streams to show free or premium. This should cut down on the size.p  pI later want to present these URLs in a table view and navigation controller. The root view will be the list of the genres, and by drilling down into each genre it will show the free or premium streams. The location such as Los Angeles will be chosen in the settings, and will not appear in the table view.p  pI would appreciate your guys suggestions. I tried to be as clear and specific as I could, sorry if I missed anything. Im not asking for code, just what your ideas and suggestions are on how to design this persistent data store, and in what to store it, given that Im new to this.p  pThanksp

Negative 1201 pI am currently working on a project where I want to search for employees via just one input search term.

So applying John AND Hamburg on the Employee Full text catalog returns 0 records since Hamburg is located in the address table.p  pSo currently I can use OR instead of AND only, likep  precodeSELECT    keyTblSp.RANK  3 AS [Rank],     sp.

One solution I could think of is to somehow compute a column in the Employee Table that holds all necessary values for the full text search like.p  pstrongEmployee tablestrongp  pEmployeeId, Firstname, Lastname, emFulltextColumnemp  pstrongSample datastrongp  p1  John  Miller  emJohn Miller Avenue 12 Hamburg 22335emp  pSo then I could dop  precodeSELECT    keyTbl.RANK AS [Rank],     sp.

I have modified my question below to try and make things cleareremp  pI have a table with the following fieldsp  ul liUserIDli liGroupIDli liActionli liActionDateli ul  pThis table simply stores whenever a user on my system is added to a group action  1 or removed from a group action  1. The datetime is recorded whenever one of the above actions take place, as ActionDatep  pA group is charged for every user they have each month as long as the user was part of the group for at least 15 days of that billing month  a billing month means not the beginning of a month necessarily, could be from the 15th of Jan to 15th of Febp  pI bill my groups every month at the begining of a billing month for all users who are part of their group at that time. Now over the course of the month they might add new users to their group or remove existing users from their group. If they removed a user I need to know if the user was part of the group for at least 15 days of that billing month. If he was then do nothing, if not then the group needs to be refunded for that user as they paid for the user at the beginning of the month but he was part of the group for less than 15 days If they added a user and the user was in the group for at least 15 days ie added within 15 days of billing month AND was not removed before 15 days were up then the group must be charged for this user. If the user did not end up with 15 days as part of the group then we do nothing no charge.p  pSome of the additional complexities arep  ul liA user might be added or removed multiple times over the course of that billing month and we would need to keep track of total number of days that he was part of the groupli liWe need to be able to differentiate between users who are being removed ultimately or added ultimately in order to correctly bill the group. for example a user who has 10 days as part of the group  if he was ultimately removed from the group then we issue a refund. If he was being added to the group then we dont charge  because less than 10 daysli liIn any given billing month the user might not appear in this table since their status was not changed  ie they remained a part of the group or were never part of the group. The truth is that nothing needs to be done with these users as if necessary they will be included in the base monthly calculation of how many users in group todayli ul  pI am starting to realize there is no simple mysql solution and i need a php, mysql combo. Please helpp  pHere is my most recent sql attempt but it does not incorporate all the issues i have discussed belowp  precodeSELECT     FROM groupuserlog   where action  1     and actiondate gt 20100201     and actiondate lt dateadd20100201,INTERVAL 15 DAY     and userid not in select userid                          from groupuserlog                         where action  1                           and actiondate lt 20100301                           and actiondate gt dateadd20100201, INTERVAL 15 DAY codepre

Negative 1201 pOur web application has a feature which uses Flash AS3 to take photos using the users web cam, then passes the resulting byte array to PHP where it is reconstructed and saved on the server.p  pHowever, we need to be able to take this web application offline, and we have chosen Gears to do so.

We dont know how to save a JPG that Flash creates in a local database.

Since no one on our team has extensive Flash background, were a bit lost. p  pIs serialization the way to go Is there a more realistic way to do this Does anyone have any experience with this sort of thing Perhaps we can build a javascript class that is the same as the byte array class in ASp

Negative 1201 pI am designing a Biztalk solution which requires client applications to subscribe and receive only a certain subset of event messages depending on their user permissions.  Subscription will be done through topic or content based routing. The client will subscribe once and receive many messages until they choose to unsubscribe.p  pClient applications will number in the 100s and subscribed topics could change on a regular basis, so defining an individual send port from Biztalk for each reciever isnt a viable solution.p  pI have thought I could build an additional message broker service which holds the individual client subscriptions and distributes messages sent from a biztalk port.p  pI have also seen that a recipient list pattern can be build using orchestrations.  This appears to me to still follow a requestresponse pattern though and I am after 1 way subscribe message to many returned event messages.p  pMy message broker solution seems to me to be doubling up on what Biztalk should be good at so I imagine I am missing some important functionality somewhere.  Has anyone tried such an application before and can give some pointers  Should I be investingating the ESB toolkit as a solution  I have had a look on the net but nothing makes it very clear for this type of topicsubscription model.p  pThanks, Philp

Negative 1201 pCurrently, a hrefhttpwww.db4o.com relnofollowdb4oa does not allow indexing on the contents of collections. What object databases do allow indexing of any individual field in the databasep  pExamplep  precodeclass RootClass     string thisIsIndexed  Field can be indexed for quick searching.    IListltSubClassgt contentsNotIndexed  new ArrayList  Creates a 1tomany relationship.   class SubClass     string thisIsNotIndexed  Field cannot be indexed.  codepre  pFor db4o to search by field thisIsNotIndexed, it would have to load the complete object into memory, then use LINQtoObjects to scan through the field. This is slow, as it means you would potentially have to load the entire database into RAM to do a search. The way to work around this is to have all of the fields you want to search by in the root object, however, this seems like an artificial limitation.p  pAre there any object databases that do not suffer from this limitation, and allow indexing of any string in a subobjectp  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pAnswer 1p  pI found a method which gives the best of both worlds ease of use with a hierarchical structure, and blindingly fast native queries using full indexing on the whole tree. It involves a bit of a trick, and a method that caches the contents of parent nodesp  ol liCreate the nested hierarchy as normal.li liFor each subnode, create a reverse reference to the nodes parent.li liYou can now query the leaf nodes. We are half way there now  we can query, however, its slow as it has to do a join to navigate up the tree nodes if you want to search by some parameter in a parent node.li liTo speed it up, create a cache parameter which caches the search terms in the parent node. Its a method that is initially set to null, the first time its called it does an expensive join, then it mirrors the field, and from that point on the search is extremely quick.li liThis works well for data that never changes, i.e. temperature samples over time. If the data is going to change, then you need some way of clearing the cached values if the value in the root node changes, perhaps by setting a dirty flag in each leaf node.li ol  pAnswer 2 p  pIf you use an Array instead of a List, you can descend into the child node using SODA. If you use a List, SODA doesnt support it, so you simply cant query with SODA or anything else that depends on SODA, such as LINQ, QBE, Native queries, etc.p

Negative 1201 pHey guys, I am still continuing to build my iPhone project and I am having trouble with launching the  facebook application. First of all, I am assuming every SDK Xcode developer knows that the Facebook application doesnt have the facebook or twitter app in the simulation. Since I have a facebook page and a twitter account about my company, I cant seem to test to launch my facebook page from the facebook application or my twitter page from the twitter application because they are not there in the iOS Simulator. So I was wondering how can I open my facebook and twitter page from the facebook and twitter application if they are not there I dont want to use a Facebook or Twitter URL, then load it into a UIWebView, I want to open the Facebook and Twitter application to launch after the click of a button in my project, then the project will close and open either Facebook or Twitter application the ones from the app store, so hopefully someone know how they can help me step by step or if they have a code that knows how to run the facebook or twitter application and sorry if my english is not clear enough, but hopefully you can help me or have a better solution to help solve my problem, thanksp

I want to add data into details and if no IDcode exists, I want to add an entry into the master table.  The problem is I have to first add the name to the fund Master..wait for a unique ID to be generatedfor IDcode then figure that out and add it to my query when I enter the master data.  As you can imagine the queries are going to probably get quite long since I have many tables.p  pIs there an easier way where everytime I add something it searches by name if a foreign key exists and if not it adds it on all the tables that its linked to  Is there a standard way people do this I cant imagine with all the complex databases out there people have not figured out a more easier way.p  pSorry if this question doesnt make sense. I can add more information if needed.p  pp.s. this maybe a different question but I have heard of Django for python and that it helps creates queries..would it help my situationp  pThanks so much in advance p

Negative 1201 pIm trying to design a database for a product aggregator.

When i step in with the debugger, i found that aers y chua are distinct of null. Then in the next two attempts the program crash telling me that it occurs a null reference exception. Im asking how that is happend. I check explicitly that both values are distinct of null, S. The complete code is rather big, but these are the relevant lines.p  pMore infop  pim really sure that IncrementalCB is  null but if i create another checkbox previous to the code that i showed then no exception is throw and the control is showed correctly.

Negative 1201 pShortening identifier names makes the resulting executable smaller in size since MSIL code includes all these names except local variable ones. Does it affect executing the code in .NET runtime in a good way in terms of performance, at least in theory Native machine code doesnt include all those names but it interoperates with .NET runtime. So I wonder if it makes sense to obfuscate namely shorten identifier names the MSIL code in order to increase the runtime performance of the application at least a little.p  pI was surprised by this statement Dotfuscator improves runtime performance. By removing unneeded program elements and renaming identifiers to small names, Dotfuscator can actually speed up programs. a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms227226.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms227226.aspxap

Negative 1201 pSo its possible to align the top, bottom, left, and right of one view with another so that their edges are flush with each other. However, Ive been wondering if its possible to align the centers of two views of different sizes. My situation occurs when I have an ImageView side by side with a TextView, like this [ImageView] [TextView]. The ImageView is bit taller than the TextView and so what I do is add paddingmargins to the bottom of TextView to get it align and look like the ImageView and TextView horizontal centers are aligned. Problem is, when this view is displayed on larger tablet screens, the padding and margins dont work out right and the TextView doesnt look aligned with the ImageView. Im sure there is an easy fix to allow this to always work out, so could someone provide me with some insights Thanksp

Negative 1201 pI am using MVC 3 and one of my views is binding to a rather large model. The actual model has over 130 properties all these are used in the view. Every time when I postback the view it is extremely slow, it takes ages until hits the server side. Is this cause by the fact that I have client validation enabledp
Negative 1201 pCurrently in my application and using the unit of work pattern and generic repository, all my controllers contain all of the business logic. Im in the process of putting everything over to use ViewModels instead of the straight Model.p  pWhile this is a good idea, now comes a question that can significantly separate my business logic in the controllers. For controllers and ViewModels, which should contain most of the business logicp  pIve tried a few ways to get my ViewModels to practically contain all the business logic. However, I do have to have an argument in my ViewModels constructor that takes a Unit of Work. Is this a good ideap  pMy code smell tells me it is. However, I am just a little worried how this will be in consistency with controllers that perform actions that do not need ViewModels. Simply put, actions that do not require to pass a ModelViewModel to a View this case happens on actions that do redirects to other actions. Which means, my business logic can either stay in that action or I could separate that business logic into a function.p  pWhat is the best practice herep
Negative 1201 pI have a specific use case of RabbitMQ in mind, and Id like to clarify certain things and ask for recommendations.p  pConsider this scenariop  p1 I publish two messages, that are tasks to be executed messageA and then messageBp  p2 my consumer gets messageA, executes the task contained in this message, but while the task is running, the server crashesp  pMy question is when the server is restarted, will messageA be requeued, and will it be requeued before messageB same order than before the crashp  pFor what I understand, messageA would be lost if the server was to crash, because my consumer has acknowledged it by default, upon reception of the message.p  pSo my idea is to consume and acknowledge message separately consume first, run the task, and then acknowledge the message when the task has been executed successfully. p  pDo you see a problem with this approach Would you advise me to do anything elsep

I have written code from most of the tutorials on the website as well as online that i could find , but most are geared towards sniffing over ethernet. I am using a mac for my packet captures. Does anyone know of a resource i could use as a guide for sniffing wireless frames and extracting data. I have some experience with cc but am not an expert and just need a place to start with understanding the differences involved with processing the 802.11 frames with pcap.p  pThanks for any helpp

Negative 1201 pIs it possible to wire up the View and ViewModel using both a Declarative DataContext and a Data Template  p  pstrongGoalstrong I want to wire Views with a one ViewModel for designtime and another at runtime.  Currently, using a Declarative DataContext for a designtime VM and a DataTemplatespecified VM for runtime doesnt behave as expected.p  pstrongBackgroundstrong  There are a variety of ways to wire up a View and ViewModel including the followingp  pA. strongemDeclaratively specify the ViewModel DataContext within the Views XAMLemstrong.

Negative 1201 pIve been searching SO and Unity Answers for weeks now and been unable to solve this problem.  I have a 3d object in Unity that is instantiated based on the users current latlong lets say 41.23423, 122.87978 then i want to move the object to the new latlong whenever their location changes. p  pSo 41.23423, 122,87978 becomes 0,0,0 in my 3D environment and i apply changes relative to that original location.p  pI am coding in C and when the action fires for a location change, i compare the two latlongs and calculate distance and angle then do a polar to cartesian conversion and move the object to the new location.p  pMy problem is that the updates are moving the object, but produce some erratic results, which im guessing is a problem in my code.  For example, if i toggle between two locations, the first change will move to 131.6, 0.0, 0.0 but then toggling it back moves doesnt move the object.  Or ive also seen in testing occasions where the first change will yield an unexpected coordinate, but any subsequent changes toggling between two points yields the same relative values for each location.p  pI dont have a good handle on what im doing wrong here, so any help would be greatly appreciated, and apologies in advance if this question is too vague or a duplicate question either problems in my code or perhaps im not approaching the problem correctlyp  pHeres the code for my class that moves the object based on location.  p  precodeusing UnityEngine using System.Collections

Negative 1201 pMy problem is as followsp  pI need to capture every strong320 bytesstrong of raw audio data.br I do this by using an NSTimer that fires a method every 0.02 seconds  that is because i need to record 8000Hz and 16bit mono audio, and ive calculated that it should be 50x a second 8000  16  320  8.p  pSo, knowing that the codeAVAudioRecordercode saves to a file, i can get every strong320 bytesstrong from that file by code[[NSData dataWithContentsOfURL[audioRecorder url]] subdataWithRangeNSMakeRangebytesUsed, 320]code, but the thing that has confused me, is that the moment i start the recording, the data files size is strong4096 bytesstrong and then after 0.5 seconds, its strong9424 bytesstrong and increases by around 5,3k bytes every half a second.p  pSo im confused if im getting the right data and thinking that the settings might be wrong.

This scheme indeed works fine when I do full project clean, however when I update another file, even though Eclipse does execute my external builder, and BuildInfo class is indeed being regenerated, Eclipse still uses old cached version of the class for the final result, so I see old info, which can sometimes be worse than not having build info at all.p  pDo you have any idea how I can tell Eclipse this file is generated and it shouldnt cache it at all, but load it from the disc after my external builder is done and before java builder Is there any other elegant solution to get that data into the buildp  pThank youp

This header file is instead included with the preprocessor and are copiedpasted by the machine instead. The header file may also include other headers but I read something about including other headers in the main file insteadp  pThen the source file is compiled. And afterwards it is linked.

Negative 1201 pIm a little confused on how codemmapcode works with the frameworks on iOS or OSX. p  pIf a file is mapped to virtual memory using codemmapcode and data is requested from it, the the kernel pages in the data to RAM. How does this actually affect how one creates objects p  pIf one usually creates an object using codealloccodecodeinitcode, the memory block is allocated and the object initiated. But what if the data resides in virtual memory, in a codemmapcodeed file Does the codealloccode need to be called on the object Does the allocated memory for the object get filled with the data from virtual memory Or does one skip the codealloccode call and just pass in the pointer to the data in virtual memoryp  pe.g. an image or a sound file, if I know where the file is in virtual memory, how would I setup the object p  pIf one allocates the data, doesnt it get duplicated if the data is already paged into RAMp  pI was thinking that using memory from virtual addresses would remove the need to allocate on the heap.p

Negative 1201 pMy web client sends Json. MongoDB is practically Json. It should be easy, but Im getting tied in knots fighting the C driver in MVC3. It seems theres no easy way to avoid working in C classes. Id have thought it would be easy just to pass Json back and forth with a little filtering.

I get an error when it tries to serialize the first field as some other type, usually trying to convert a string or a date to AsBoolean. Its a shame the driver cant allow the doc to be serialized a little more easily.p  pI had similar trouble trying to use a BsonDocument to represent a dynamic piece of my object graph. I figured better that than a json string, but of course it wont serialize. I ended up using Dictionarylt which is fine.p  pIve also tried these with similar resultsp  precodereturn Jsonmr.GetResults return Jsonmr.GetResults.ToArray codepre  pSo Ive also tried the following Ive seen people have success withp  precodevar jsonText  mr.ToJson  empty var jsonText  mr.GetResults.toJson  Exception No serializer found for type System.Collections.IEnumerator. codepre  pAll I want to do is throw back what looks almost exactly like Json already but I cant figure out how to serialize it.

Negative 1201 pI know vectorized code is faster than using loops. So Ive been trying to do this with this peace of program. I was hoping someone could show me how to improve these for and if loops. The program is meant to calculate the power load curve of a house, taking into account if the different appliances are switch on or switch off at different hours of day, month, year.  The ProbFanSummerWd, ProbCellChargerSummerWd, etc are probability matrix use to decide if the appliance is on or off based on a previous randomic choose. And TotalLoad is the resultant power curve. This function is repeated many times within a larger program and consumes much time.  Is there any suggestion to improve those for and if loop maybe replacing them for a vectorization form.  Hope someone could help me.

Negative 1201 pI would like to use a Groovy closure to process data coming from a SQL table. For each new row, the computation would depend on what has been computed previously. However, new rows may become available on further runs of the application, so I would like to be able to reload the closure, initialised with the intermediate state it had when the closure was last executed in the previous run of the application.p  pFor example, a closure intending to compute the moving average over 3 rows would be implemented like thisp  precodedef prev2Val  null def prevVal  null def prevId  null  Closure c   row gt     println[ prev2Val, prevVal, prevId]      def latestVal  row[val]      if prev2Val  null          def movMean  prev2Val  prevVal  latestVal  3         sql.executeINSERT INTO outputid, val VALUES , , [prevId, movMean]           sql.executeUPDATE testdata SET processedTRUE WHERE id, [row[id]]      prev2Val  prevVal     prevVal  latestVal     prevId  row[id]  codepre  pcodetestdatacode has 3 columns codeidcode autoincremented primary key, codevaluecode and codeprocessedcode. A moving mean is calculated based on the two previous values and inserted into the codeoutputcode table, against the codeidcode of the previous row. Processed rows are flagged with codeprocessedTRUEcode.p  pIf all the data was available from the start, this could be called like thisp  precodesql.eachRowSELECT id, val FROM testdata WHERE processedFALSE ORDER BY id, c codepre  pThe problem comes when new rows become available after the application has already been run. This can be simulated by processing a small batch each time e.g. using codeLIMIT 5code in the previous statement.p  pI would like to be able to dump the full state of the closure at the end of the execution of codeeachRowcode saving the intermediate data somewhere in the database for example and reinitialise it again when I rerun the whole application by loading those intermediate variable from the database.p  pIn this particular example, I can do this manually by storing the values of codeprev2Valcode, codeprevValcode and codeprevIdcode, but Im looking for a generic solution where knowing exactly which variables are used wouldnt be necessary.p  pPerhaps something like codec.getStatecode which would return code[ prev2Val 1, prevVal 2, prevId 6]code for example, and where I could use c.setStatecode[ prev2Val 1, prevVal 2, prevId 6]code next time the application is executed if there is a state stored. p  pI would also need to exclude codesqlcode from the list. It seems this can be done using codec.sqlnullcode.p  pI realise this is unlikely to work in the general case, but Im looking for something sufficiently generic for most cases. Ive tried to codedehydratecode, serialize and coderehydratecode the closure, as described in a hrefhttpjira.codehaus.orgbrowseGROOVY5151 relnofollowthis Groovy issuea, but Im not sure how to save and store all the codecode fields in a single operation.p  pIs this possible Is there a better way to remember state between executions, assuming the list of variables used by the closure isnt necessarily known in advancep

Negative 1201 pBasically Im trying to rotate a Bitmap from an image in an Android App. The reason why I want to do this is that a picture taken from the camera through an intent is displayed horizontally even if its captured vertically, and the orientation is kept as metadata on the image. Correct me if in wrong. The problem is, however, that the image will take up a lot of memory when loaded in, if taken on a phone with a reasonably good camera, and I havent found a way to rotate and save it without the risk of getting OutOfMemoryError. The code below is where ip  ol liLoad in the imageli liCheck if it needs to be rotatedli liLoads a scaleddown version for display in an ImageViewli liRotates the small image if necessaryli liIn a seperate thread load, rotate and save the image, so it doesnt need to in the futureli ol  pIt is important for the application to keep the images in the resolution, but any tricks with encodings are welcome.

Negative 1201 pThe code I am working on is throwing the aforementioned exception. I am not very experienced with multithreaded programming and Im not having a lot of luck troubleshooting this. p  pThe program is written in Java using Processing and OSC. The main OSC event handler is adding elements to a Vector. It is triggered on user input and therefore highly unpredictable. This Vector is also being iterated over and updated in Processings animation thread which happens very regularly at about 60 times per second.p  pOccasionally, the OSC events handler is called as the Vector is being iterated over in the animation thread and the exception is thrown. p  pI have tried adding the codesynchronizedcode modifier to the OSC event handler. I have also attempted to cue changes to the Vector until the next frame  time step  of the animation thread, but Im finding that it just ends up delaying the exception being thrown.p  pWhat can I do to prevent this behavior Is there a way to only access to the Vector if it isnt already in usep  pstrongUpdatestrong Two answers have suggested that the list is having elements added or removed as it is being iterated over.

Negative 1201 pbr  I would like to know how would you address such a problemp  pI have a class codeFoocodep  precodeclass Foo  public     Foo          Foo         float member1  return member1  private      float member1      other members etc...  codepre  pA container class that, among other things, holds a container of pointers to Foo instancesp  precodeclass FooContainer  public    FooContainer        FooContainer        void addFooFoo f foos.pushbackf private    boostptrvectorltFoogt foos  codepre  pMy problem is this at runtime I am required to add new completely different members to Foo, depending on the instructions from the GUI. I could address the problem by creating two decorators like thisp  precodeclass Decorator1  public    int   alpha  return alpha     float beta   return beta  private    int alpha    float beta   class Decorator2  typedef stdcomplexltfloatgt cmplx public    cmplx  gamma  return gamma     double delta   return delta  private    cmplx  gamma    double delta  codepre  pand then I would create two different Foo implementationsp  precodeclass Foo1  public Foo, public Decorator1       class Foo2  public Foo, public Decorator2      codepre  pand use each one according to the GUI command. However such a change would propagate through all my code and would force me to create two different versions for each class that uses codeFoo1code and codeFoo2code e.g. Id have to create codeFooContainer1code and codeFooContainer2code. p  pA less intrusive way of doing this would be to create p  precodeclass Bar public Foo, public Decorator1, public Decorator2     codepre  pand use this instead of codeFoocode. In this case Id call only the functions I need from codeDecorator1code and codeDecorator2code and ignore the others, but this seems to go against good OOP techniques. p  pAny suggestions regarding the problem p

Negative 1201 pI have a database consisting of a large number of images several million and contentsignatures for those images generated by a hrefhttpwww.pureftpd.orgprojectlibpuzzle relnofollowlibpuzzlea which I need to compare.p  pIve run a bunch of different alternatives to try and make it efficient, including various search algorithms with a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiLevenshteindistance relnofollowlevenshtein differencea currently running fastest and with various datapoints as prefilters to cut comparisons down to batches of only a few thousand images but everything Ive tried is still way to slow for production use. I add several thousand images per day, which need to have their signatures compared to everything else in the complete collection.p  pThe two main storage methods Ive used are CouchDb and MySql, both required data storage upwards of 10s of gigs and after just a few million records MySql runs far too slowly even with resultcaching and index keysize variations, the indexes are just too big using an approach similar a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma97803141358220to this onea which is excellent but still slow, and on Couch it just seems incapable of handling large indexes. I also considered services like Amazon SimpleDB which would solve the storage problem but I expect would be very expensive given the memory requirements for such large indexes and may not fare any better than Couch.p  pTable structure is simplyp  precodeImageId int11, Signature VARCHAR1020 implemented as text codepre  pDesired result should be a list of ImageIds given an ImageId. A simple self join ON comparison function is far too slow.p  pMy implementation is to compare existing images, and on an ongoing basis compare new images with the existing base, to achieve these 2 goals... 1 Identify identical or verynearidentical images including resizes, crops and minor color variation, and 2 identify similar images to aid imagesearches who may be interested in images of a similar visual content. The libpuzzle library provides a score which can be used for both I use 95 for the former and 80 for the latter.p  pEssentially my question is, does anyone know of either abr a a different data storage platformbr b a technique using MySql br c or some other presumably custom approachbr Which can be used to linearly compare huge amounts of binary data, in a very efficient wayp

Negative 1201 pI am using NSXMLParser to parse HTML from web sites.  Testing site is under my control but in operation sites will not be.p  pProblem is when parser encounters javascript which contains bad characters.  For example, javascript containing codeifscreen.widthlt521code.  The problem is the lt in the code.  I can see the problem but am unsure if there is any good way round it. the NSXMLParser is reporting NSXMLParserErrorDomain error 68. and I can see why  it is treating the lt as the start of a new tag but  is not a valid tag name character....  But then what would I do with e.g. codeifvarlt20code p  pI actually not interested in the specific content so could do things like global replaceremoval of e.g. lt and  etc. but in some regards that seems a bit of a mess as I was using NSXMLParser to avoid having to start messing around with the content.  If substitution is the best way forward, I can envisage lt and  but any other sequences I should include p  pI am new to Cocoa so may easily have missed something obvious  in which case many apologies.  I did see that others have found similar problems but could not get a good way forward from the questions.p  pI am handling the error OK in a tidy manner but it is preventing my app from doing what it is meant to do  i.e. I need to avoid the error rather than handle it.p  pBackground that application is doing a before and after comparison on the html and looking for changes.  I could swap lt for something really weird, then swap it back when necessary.  I could even check the data for the replace content first to eliminate possible ambiguities e.g. find a UID sequence not in the downloaded page, replace lt with UID sequence, parse page, if need be, replace UID with lt, ditto for .p  pI have looked at e.g. libtidy of libxml2 but cannot find easy documentation and am wary about launching down such a route if it will not solve the issues.p

Negative 1201 pI currently have a device that drives the camera via bulb mode.  It has one cable connected to the bulb connector, and the other to the PC flash connector.  The PC flash signal is only triggered as soon as the shutter is open.  There is up to 100 ms of variable latency between triggering the shutter and it actually opening.  So if I want to expose for exactly 50 ms, I trigger bulb, wait for PC flash signal, then wait 50 ms, then stop triggering bulb.  I now have a USB version of this device that uses the EDSDK, the only problem is that I cant find any sort of EDSDK event that is the equivalent of the PC flash signal.  Is there any EDSDK event that signals the exact moment that the shutter opensp

Negative 1201 pSo, Im having a rather weird problem. I have a server, that when I try to SSH into, immediately closes the connection if I type in the correct password on the first attempt. However, if I purposefully enter a wrong password on the first attempt, and then enter a correct password at the second or third prompt, it successfully logs me into the computer. Similarly, when I try to use public key authentication, I get an immediate closed connection.

Negative 1201 pIm using knockout and the mapping plugin to automatically create my view model. I have a bunch of amounts in my view model that I bind to textboxes. When a user changes an amount in a textbox, all I want is to make sure what they entered is a number, and that its greater than 0, and if it isnt I want to replace what they entered with 0. This seems like it should be SO simple... with a custom binding or subscribe function.p  pEverything Im reading about knockout validation talks about extenders and readwrite computed observables, or adding yet another plugin such as jquery validation. They all seem like overkill for the situation, and the extenderscomputed observables have to be explicitly declared for each observable you want to validate.

Negative 1201 pI am programming in C for a simulation software that is called AMESim and I need help for the management of 2D arrays.p  pAMESim works, like other simulation software such as Simulink or LabView, putting some icons in an ambient called sketch and linking them together, simulating real systems. Behind an icon there is a C function, that is the part that I am writing well, I am updating it from Fortran. The software has a builtin integrator, that calls the various submodels at needed time and manages the progression in time, so I have not direct access to that part of the code.p  pI am experiencing problems in one of these submodels a model of an hydraulic pump where this submodel is not present works perfectly, while when this model is connected the simulation stops abruptly after a certain amount of time after 1.8... seconds of simulated time, or after about 19701980 calls from the integrator. p  pThis submodel does some heavy calculation on tribology using Reynolds equation applied on a 2D surface, that is represented in the code with a matrix, whose dimensions are decided by the user through graphical interface and then are passed to the function as parameters. On these basis, I need to implement the matrix with dynamical arrays, or better with an array of pointers to pointers I say one matrix, but really there are several ones of them, some of integer type and some floating, and also about a dozen of monodimensional arrays. Matrices are of dimension codeLLeMcode, while some arrays have dimension codeLLecode and others have dimension codeMcode.p  pAfter experiencing the problem, I tried to narrow the possible causes of error by progressively disabling parts of the code, until I reached the state that is posted below. Doing various tests, I came to understand that the problem is in the allocation of the matricesarrays at a certain moment, codemalloccode will return an error  a codeNULLcode when trying to allocate a row of one of the matrices. I tried various configurations of the function and of the subfunctions that regulate allocationdeallocation, but I am stuck with the error. This happens also when changing compiler I have tried with Intel and MS VisualC 32bit.p  pHere is the codep  precodeinclude ltmath.hgt include ltstdio.hgt include ltstdlib.hgt include ameutils.h    it is a library of AMESim that has various IO utilities include ltmalloc.hgt include ltstring.hgt include ltdirect.hgt include lterrno.hgt  various functions prototypes void allocatematrixint table, int rows, int columns  void freematrixint table, int rows void allocatematrixddouble table, int rows, int columns  void freematrixddouble table, int rows  bla bla check of parameters and so on  this is my main function void barreldin27wpprova bla bla, there are a lot of parameters  for the calculation that I will skip  ,  double rp, array with real parameters chosen by the user int ip, array with integer parameters double c, array with static double that are saved between calls of the function int ic[6] array with static int     int loop, i double XdibNULL, XwibNULL, XddbNULL, XwdbNULL double MatHNULL, MatPdimNULL, MatxNULL, MatyNULL, DummyMatNULL, MatZpNULL int DummyMatIntNULL, MatrixtNULL, MatrixtnNULL, MatrixpNULL, MatrixpnNULL double VectRNULL, DummyLNULL, DummyMNULL, tetarNULL, tetagNULL, radimNULL these are all of my arrays  allocation of dynamic blocks    allocatematrixampDummyMatInt,LLe,M       repeat for all int matrices    allocatematrixdampMatx,LLe,M       repeat for all double matrices  the program stops with an error from malloc during one of these allocations     VectR mallocLLe  sizeofdouble    if VectR  NULL       amefprintfstdout,Error in allocation of VectRn   amefprintf is internal                             of AMESim, the same as fprintf     AmeExit1 exit function of AMESim         repeated for all dynamic arrays, then initialized to 0.e0 with for cycles  a lot of calculation and subfunctions, that are all disabled in this example function outputs    are set to zero  Deallocation of dynamic blocks freematrixampDummyMatInt, LLe    repeated for all int matrices freematrixdampMatx, LLe          repeated for all double matrices freeVectR VectR NULL             repeated for all arrays  codepre  pThese are the two functions for allocationdeallocation, for space reasons I will write only the integer onesp  precodevoid allocatematrixint table, int rows, int columns    int i,j   table   mallocrows  sizeof table    if table  NULL       amefprintfstdout,Error in memory allocation array of pointersn     AmeExit1        for i  0 i lt rows i       table[i]  malloccolumns  sizeof table[i]      if table[i]  NULL           amefprintfstdout,Error in memory allocation row d n,i         AmeExit1               for j0 j lt columns j          table[i][j]  0                   void freematrixint table, int rows  int i for i  0 i lt rows i          free table[i]     table[i]  NULL      free table table  NULL return  codepre  pI was writing to check if I have messed up something with all the referencingdereferencing of the pointers and to better understand how to control the free space of the heap.

Negative 1201 pI am trying to create a parser using flexbison for a veriloglike language or more specifically verilog with some extra constructs, that is used to generate verilog code and I am having trouble figuring out how to construct my bison rules to handle a general type of constructs that are available in the language.p  pA general example of this construct is thisp  precode output wire          upo, input  wire [40]    upi,   A comment  myif a eq b   input  wire        anclki,   output wire        anrsto, myendif output wire                                           outo  codepre  pIn principle the codemyifcode can be nested and within the code code everything can be within a codemyifcode block, without any codemyifcode. This leads me to believe that my current idea is flawed and that i simply do not understand how to do this mutual recursion.p  pWhat seems to causing me problems is the code,code that is terminating every line within the block except for the final line. My lexer ignores comments and tokenize the lines fine, I also parse the codemyifcode line specially.p  pBelow is the relevant bison rules I have now,p  precodeportdecla  ports     ports port  ports , port  ports , ifs  ifs   ifs ifhead ports TENDIF  if  codepre  pThe codeifheadcode and codeportcode parse the codemyifcode and inputoutput lines fines.p  pAny ideas on how to create these rules would be very much appreciatedp

Negative 1201 pI have a database that has 60 million records. The current set up is there is 1 table with 30 million and a couple small tables with 5 million ish in each one. The data structure is the same for each table. The person who had created our search the first time 34 years ago before i was here used multiple small tables. We are using codematch againstcode for each with joins. My boss and him were under the impression that using multiple tables lets MySQL search each table simultaneously.

Negative 1201 pThis is a general programming question.p  pI have seen on a lot of posts that iterating through a 2d array via a double for loop is horrible ugly etc... Why is thisp  pAre arrays not an efficient data structure compared to dictionaries and such, and also is not a double for loop more efficient than a foreach or other alternative Also if your using a 2d array you are often dealing with a 2d coordinate system. The x and y positions are already built in to the data structure as the indexes of the arrays so you dont need to add ,say, a tuple as a dictionary key  and by changing the for loop paramaters you can very cheaply iterate through different parts of your grid while totally ignoring the parts you dont want to iterate through. For example to avoid the outer rows and columns you could do.. p  precodefor int x  1 x lt Grid.GetLength01 x          for int y  1 y lt Grid.GetLength11 y                      Grid[x,y].DoSomething           codepre  pWith a foreach youd iterate through emeverythingem in the collection and then have something to check whether it is in the coordinate range you want.p

Negative 1201 pIm learning iOS development stuff and what I have found in tutorials and books is that controller layer usually has access to the Views controls directly textfields, labels etc.. Lets consider such an examplep  pAssume, that View has a label called codelblResultcode and a textfield called codetxtDataToAnalyzecode. Than in controler interface weve got something like thisp  precodeproperty nonatomic, retain IBOutlet UILabel lblResult property nonatomic, retain IBOutlet UITextField txtDataToAnalyze codepre  pand some codesynthesizecode statements in the implementation file.p  pI have some experience with JavaSwing development, where most of thinks Im writing manually without any GUI Builders, and what I usually do in MVC is to access the Views controls via getterssetter. For example codevoid setResultString resStringcode or codeString getDataToAnalyzecode. In that way, controller knows only emwhatem pieces of information are displayed in the view, and not emhowem are they displayed. I think it is more flexible it is easier to change the view layer later.p  pI know that iOS has some specific rules, has introduced XIBNIB files etc so maybe my doubts are completely useless in case of iPhoneiPad development. But I am going to write some more serious application for iOS actually rewrite it from Java Swing and thats why I would like to ask youp  pDo you think, I should change the way I am thinking and get accustomed to that new for me approach xib files, creating GUI using dragampdrop and strongproviding controler with information about how data should be displayed in viewstrong  Did you have similar doubts when starting with iOS p

Considering these extend from LinearLayout, I assume the lack of lint warnings is irrelevant, this is still going to cause a loss in performance rightp  pIs there a better way I feel like I am missing something obviousp  pstrongEDIT 2 In case anyone is interested in the solution for this, I have created a custom layout as raphw suggested and will post the source code herestrongp

Negative 1201 pWe wanted to develop a web search app for Android 2.2, and the language were dealing with is Arabic script RTL based.

Negative 1201 pI am having an issue that involves a differentiation between whether a status update belongs to a user or a company. Let me explain Individuals can post statuses as a user or as a company. A user can be a memberowner of a company and switch to a company in the dashboard much like Facebook. The problem is how will we set in the database whether a status was posted by a company or by a user p  pMy solution was to have a company column that was a Boolean variable and when we query for each status to display we check if it was from a company. If so then we grab the companyid and look up the name and other relevant information in the database and display it on the site. Does this sound like the right approach Additionally, does the schema below look correctp  precodeCompany id int11 name varchar 255  Companymembers companyid int11 FKCompany userid int11 FKUsers owner BOOLEAN  Users id int11 name varchar 255  Status id date DATETIME userid  FKUsers companyid FKCompany company BOOLEAN codepre

Negative 1201 pI am trying to return a randomized result of a filter query to give all my documents a fair chance of being on the first page results. In an effort to not confuse users during repeated searches and to easily support pagination the results should stay consistent for the current day.p  pTo do this I have developed the following script sort query. It combines the document id a guid, so already fairly random with a daily salt just the day of year and current year combined and hashes the result to produce what I would expect to be a fairly random string, that only changes as the daily salt changes each day ignore the extraneous elements in this specific query, its generated from code.p  precode   from 0,   size 20,   sort      script        order asc,       type string,       script org.elasticsearch.common.Digest.md5HexdailySalt  doc[id].value,       params          dailySalt 1842013               ,   query      filtered        query          matchall        ,       filter          bool            must [                            term                  tagid Some Tag                            ,                            matchall                         ]                        ,   fields [     id   ]  codepre  pInspired from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9796470randomorderpaginationelasticsearchthis similar question and answerap  pIt works, but not very well. I get slightly different results as I increment the daily salt, but the same documents keep appearing around the top results. They move slightly, but theres definitely a consistent pattern.p  pIve tried to change the hash function to another I found codeorg.elasticsearch.cluster.routing.operation.hash.djb.DjbHashFunction.DJBHASHcode but it gives very similar results of common top results.p  pIm no cryptography expert so I presume this is a behavior of common hash functions and there must be some special hash functions to use for more randomized results based on similar inputs  p  pIs anyone familiar with one available in ElasticSearch Im using a hrefhttpssearchbox.io relnofollowSearchbox.ioa cloud hosted elastic search service so installing my own custom function is not an option.  p  pOr am I approaching this problem from a completely wrong anglep  pstrongEditstrong I just looked at the resultant sort keys produced by the script, and it appears that the script is only being applied to the first page of results, and then sorting that first page rather than applying to the full result set and therefor changing the documents within the first page.p  pHeres my first page results edited for brevity. But you can see on the first page alone that the sort key varies from 0c to fa, for the first 0  20 docs, with a total of 200 docs.p  pUsing dailySalt  1852013p  precode took 2, timedout false, shards      total 1,     successful 1,     failed 0 , hits      total 196,     maxscore null,     hits [         fields              id 27662ef8d2a74fde80f61571b83c4cde         ,         sort [0cbf8b4e7927f0a53a5b82f2630ff9ad]     ,          fields              id d9b11797053f495ea6760ec959dba879         ,         sort [0fa8730a5239f8a3d1286cbe16619bfa]     ,          fields              id 482c893f10834860892e1b25cf442199         ,         sort [295edd71cc48ac41c5e2f91315abf5ce]     ,          fields              id 581fd0f19ecb4e5c920b06413bfbf4f7         ,         sort [4b9f0d17bc2333d13a1963b4f6afb829]     ,          fields              id de3dddb8e2964446ac4c135cc925669d         ,         sort [4c5d0bcb50f5b600e539ba46b33b1007]     ,          fields              id c83ad22e80b440f18e562153a1a1f9e8         ,         sort [55efe0a692ab3205405f1c74732b8205]     ,          fields              id 7bd198294f374e029fd10239b8ae8db4         ,         sort [5adcd22c7c507244d7ba382812accdf3]     ,          fields              id 42fcec43851f4133a8db1d2bf0b86ec8         ,         sort [6757f46bd554e3353a2ebf35c6b3d24c]     ,          fields              id e119132b4e93404785131ce2452f0cdd         ,         sort [6dbcb59a2b5e91523896d57695251b29]     ,          fields              id 7d0acf5d7c1445a297b717939ff512f4         ,         sort [9d99752ec0802e55dcfb3c83bcd2e4bb]     ,          fields              id 2cdc21e43312460b9a18094e4f95a56c         ,         sort [9dc43d1d39e64cfe04c6d7b8f565faaa]     ,          fields              id 0f665cb35648416cb08f146d2a019319         ,         sort [b61bb718fe63a287b6fcdc8bcd638604]     ,          fields              id 1e852d492b3b4d7a9f1b1495b94e723e         ,         sort [ba7ad8a3a6e195a6bc28e341f9d6965b]     ,          fields              id ca2a5922bb424317b61c129925436a1f         ,         sort [bca0411cf8d67b4dcd5b205a5010367f]     ,          fields              id b1dac7607d734b60bd6d08ea9453e68c         ,         sort [be3714cfb2517e98d525aaea6e40cfa5]     ,          fields              id c4b08def59db4ac0b16f0c3fae4c01f2         ,         sort [c4220b31c305d536c7a7d1639da32c66]     ,          fields              id cc7ac1fd3e884503a8372000ebb6e2d9         ,         sort [ceb5710fe2418fe3b353bf7b1f737570]     ,          fields              id 5a5f90c9b44f4ca29d16117c8e9fd388         ,         sort [dc5fea76598633cb08c1459983ebca62]     ,          fields              id 6d811d5b41384a41a1861b9aa2b65623         ,         sort [ea3c55ac123ac9e819b145402407d1de]     ,          fields              id b489d2dab4a144deacde219109edd42f         ,         sort [fab53cc11983b45b081d4b01df555c59]     ]   codepre

But the following precise result may easily be demonstratedp      blockquote     pLet S be a sentence emTem, emUem, emEem  emphraseem  emAem such that tynames emEem  emTem, and let S be a sentence emTem, emUem, emEem  emphraseem  emAem occurring in a proof of S then also tynames emEem  emTem.p   blockquote      p[page 21]p blockquote  pBut Im doubly confused by this.p  pFirstly mdash the above theorem seems backward. If I correctly understand the phrase occurring in a proof of S, then this seems to mean by contrapositive once you have a context that violates the intention that tynames emEem  emTem, all subsequent contexts will also violate that intention. Even if thats true, it seems that it would be much more useful and meaningful to assert the converse, namely, if all contexts so far conform to the intention that tynames emEem  emTem, then any subsequently inferable context will also conform to that intention. Nop  pSecondly mdash neither MLtons statement nor the emDefinitionems statement actually seems to be supported by the inference rules or the Further Restrictions that follow them. A few inference rules have tynames emtauem  emTem of emCem or tynames emVEem  emTem of emCem as a sidecondition, but none of those rules is needed for this program given in the abovelinked documentationp  precodeval r  ref NONE datatype t  A  B val   r  SOME A codepre  pSpecifically rule 4 has to do with codeletcode, rule 14 with codegtcode, and rule 26 with codereccode. None of those is used in this program.p  pAnd coming at it from the other direction, rule 17, which covers codedatatypecode declarations, requires only that the generated type names not be in emTem of emCem so it doesnt prevent the generation of a type name used in the existing value environment except insofar as its already true that tynames emVEem  emTem of emCem.p  pI feel like Im probably missing something pretty basic here, but I have no idea what it could bep
Negative 1201 pIve got this awesome slideshow library working just fine on my site yoinked from codrops, but since Im shifting between different pieces of information, I want to really call out the difference by adding a CSS change so that the background color matches the color of the content in the slide.

Negative 1201 pstrongBackgroundstrongbr I have some code that is connecting to a server to pull data.  However, at some point the program got into a state where it was failing to connect to the server. The problem we were seeing is that the server was continually timing out when we were attempting to reconnect.p  pemPluginem br We have our timeout set to the default values used by our network plugin a Thrift plugin.  These values are 100k millisecond timeout and 300k millisecond readwrite timeout.  Not exactly short timeouts.  Also, every time we attempt to reconnect, we recreate the plugins class, so whatever values its setting internally are reset each time we attempt to reconnect.  I believe timeouts are not the issue. And I believe the plugin is not the issue.p  pemNetworkembr We saw these repeated timeouts occur for half an hour.  When we restarted the service not the machine, it immediately came back online.  So, I know it wasnt a network issue.  That leads me to believe its something in our code that is getting into an invalid network state.  Also, it is a state that we cant control, since our plugin hides all of the good network stuff from usincluding timeouts, keepalive flags, and connection groups among others.  We basically dont have access to the HTTPWebReqest member.p  pstrongQuestionstrongbr When our network settings get into this state, we attempt to close all connections and reconnect to the server.  The goal was to kill all the active connections in order to reset whatever state we got into.  However, when we attempt to reconnect, were getting timeouts on our reconnect.p  pSomehow probably due to the KeepAlive and TCP Pipelining, which we cant control, the network connections remain open even though we have closed all connections.  This leaves us in a bad state and prevents us from cycling our connections to the server.p  pemThe questionembr How can I kill all underlying connections to a server in order to force a reconnectp

Negative 1201 pI am working on Highcharts API, In my chart I am using multiple series with stacked bar charts. The requirement is to show the square marker on an expected valuethat may be sometimes different then the current percentage on each bar in percent view. I have added two series, one is showing bars perfect on the current percentage but the second series appears like straight line on 100. The same scenario works in normal view perfectly.p  pI have tried recreating the problem in fiddle, in the fiddle the temperature series is a straight line rather than displaying the diferent percentage and the other is showing perfect percentage.p  pI am eager to know how the percent view calculates the percentage in case of multiple series. Im looking for some tracks and advices about my code and thank you in Advance.p

Negative 1201 pIn C, I have to implement an ExcelAccesslike quote querybuilder to allow custom sorting of a dataset. If you sort by columns A, B and C in Excel using the query builder or ORDER BY a, b, c in SQL, you get all the As in order, all the Bs within each group of identical As in order, and all the Cs within each group of identical Bs in order, which is what most people understand by sortorder by a, b, c. This seems to be the same as doing sort by c, then sort by b, then sort by a  ie. sorting individually on each column in reverse order  as long as you use stablesort. Which is how Ive implemented it in my program. User says sort by a, b, c, program does stablesort by c, stablesort by b, stablesort by a  same result, with all the datasets Ive used so far. My question is, is this a wellknown equivalence that holds true for any dataset strongprovided a stable sort algorithm is usedstrong and any combination of columns, and is there even a mathematical proof for it I have not found any such proof via Google or other means asking programmers, statisticians and mathematicians so far.p

Negative 1201 pI have two contexts working with visual studio 2013.  The one for the IdentityModel and another context I created for the main database.   The problem I am having is whenever I run the updatedatabase in the package manager console, it creates the ApplicationDBContext DB in both.  The one for my main database never gets created because it seems it sees it as the ApplicationDBContext.   I have tried EnableMigrations ContextTypeName DIMVC.Models.DIDBContext and it does not create the main database tables for the DIDBContext class.  I was able to do this in visual studio 2012 without an issue in creating the database.  That was without the ApplicationDBContext though.  Any help on what I am doing wrong would be greatly appreciated.  p  pBelow are my 2 code files.  The normal IdentityModel and my DIDBContext class I created.

Negative 1201 pI have a main view in my program with a draggable view in it. This view can be dragged around with pan gestures.

Negative 1201 pI already asked a question about a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma58640001279092thisa answer on another topic, but I kind of got very interested to learn from it, so I have another doubt now. In particular, I was looking at the authenticate method, and the data mapper fetch method. I also found a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma109889661279092thisa answer as extremely helpful on this topic where the fetch method is kind of explained, but it is skipped the part where I am in doubt. The user tereko that answers this questions, on couple of occasions suggests that the methods in the data mapper should not be fetchById, fetchByUsername, etc., but rather one fetch method. My question is how am I going to fetch something specific as the methods I wrote, having only the domain object at handp  pFor example, if I have a register service method where I need to check and possibly store username, password and email, I would need to fetch by username to check whether the user already exists, and after that to fetch by email to check whether that email is in the database already. So, how do I know in the fetch method what to do if I only havep  precodemappergtfetchobject codepre  pDo I possibly set fetch options on the domain objectp  precodeaccountgtsetFetchOptions[username] codepre  pAnd then in the fetch method I would check and fetch. Does this makes sense If someone has another idea, share it.p

And I know that angularjs provides custom additional field validators for mixmax length etc directives, so I dont to test those either.p  pBut I still cant help thinking that I need to test my form as a unit, in particular whether its valid or not.br For example, the domain business rules might say that the form can only be submitted if the name, phone number and email fields are all filled out, and that the email address field contains a valid formatted email address.br In this case I would want to write a series of unit tests where I populate the form objects properties with various combinations of data, and assert the validity of the form.p  pMaybe the problem is that Im coming from a java background, and the above pattern re unit testing is certainly what Im used to.p

Although, due to the interactive nature of online learning discussion board, quiz etc, the synchronization should be bidirectional between master and slaves. Plus, slave server should be able to provide transparency to end users, record all interactions locally and update master server once link is recovered race condition and conflicts need to be solved intelligently. These slave servers will be deployed in either Raspberry Pi or other lowpower consumption platform powered by solar.

Negative 1201 pHow can I add rows to this helperp  precode Html.TextAreaForx gt Model.xxx[i].xxx,  htmlAttributes  new  class  formcontrol  codepre  pIt seems like the default is 2 rows, I would like to add to it.p
Negative 1201 pIm working on an OSX application that transmits data to a hardware device over USB serial. The hardware has a small serial buffer that is drained at a variable rate and should always stay nonempty.p  pWe have a write loop in its own NSThread that checks if the hardware buffer is full, and if not, writes data until it is. The majority of loop iterations dont write anything and take almost no time, but they can occasionally take up to a couple milliseconds as timed with CACurrentMediaTime. The thread sleeps for 100ns after each iteration. I know that sleep time seems insanely short, but if we bump it up, the hardware starts getting datastarved.p  pThis works well much of the time. However, if the main thread or another application starts doing something processorintensive, the write thread slows down and isnt able to stream data fast enough to keep the devices queue from emptying.p  pSo, wed like to make the serial write thread realtime. I read a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibrarymacdocumentationdarwinconceptualkernelprogrammingschedulerscheduler.html relnofollowthe Apple docsa on requesting realtime scheduling through the Mach API, then tried to adapt the code snippet from SetPriorityRealtimeAudiomachportt machthreadid in the a hrefhttpsrc.chromium.orgsvntrunksrcbasethreadingplatformthreadmac.mm relnofollowChromium sourcea.p  pHowever, this isnt working  the application remains just as susceptible to serial communication slowdowns. Any ideas Im not sure if I need to change the write threads behavior, or if Im passing in the wrong thread policy parameters, or both. I experimented with various periodcomputationconstraint values, and with forcing a more consistent duty cycle write for 100ns max and then sleep for 100ns but no luck.p  pA related question How can I check the threads priority directly, andor tell if its starting off as realtime and then being demoted vs not being promoted to begin with Right now Im just making inferences from the hardware performance, so its hard to tell exactly whats going on.p

Negative 1201 pbr I have a question regarding the licensing of open source Java libraries and the libraries they depend on.p  pWhen I include open source Java libraries into my closed source commercially distributed Java software, I need to check the licences of those open source libs, but do I need to check their dependencies as wellp  pSo if a open source library A uses the libraries B and C internally, do I need to check B and C libraries for their license compatability, too and then their used libs, too Libraries B and C could be packaged inside library A inside the jar file, or could be added as external dependencies, like in e.g. a pom.xml file for Maven you specify your dependency to library A in your project, and Maven automatically knows the dependencies for B and C and downloads them into your project.p  pDoes this differ from the used licence type, like ASLv2, MIT, LGL or EPLp  pThank you very much for your answersp  hr  pEdit As user Gimby noted in a comment, I do not search for legal advice of course.

Negative 1201 pIn C I am aware that a virtual destructor should generally be used when one intends to inherit from a base class. However, with C I am not sure what should be done. Consider the following codep  precodepublic abstract class Character      private string characterName     public int health      Character                 Character            public virtual void SetCharacterName string tempName               characterName  tempName           public virtual string GetCharacterName               return characterName       codepre  pNote I have heard that Unity3Ds implementation of C is slightly different than standard. Perhaps ignore some minor formatting errors, the code is seemingly functional...p  pMy first instinct was the make the Character destructor virtual, by defining it asp  precodevirtual Character   codepre  pyet doing so causes the IDE to return an error. p  pstrongIn C, is it necessary or considered standard to use a virtual destructor for abstract classes which wish to be inherited Or are there other means of making a virtual destructor with Cstrong p
Negative 1201 pSo Ive been programming for a year but this concept still trips me up sometimes. My understanding is that if you dont initialize and allocate a new object when you create a new variable name using the pointer operator  that the danger is that the value of that new variable will always just be tied to whatever memory address it is youve pointed the name. For example, in 2 if string is set to 6 because array[1] is set to 6 but later the value of element 1 in array changes to 7 then string will return 7. But if I used method 1 where I use a string class method to allocate and initialize a memory address of its own for string then string would stay 6 even if later element 1 is changed to hold a value of 7. Is this right p  pWhats the difference betweenp  precodeNSString string  [NSString stringwithstring array[1]] codepre  pANDp  precodeNSString string   array[1] codepre  pAs a sidenote I have a tough time understanding how this will matter much because if array is immutable then the only way it could be changed is if a new array is initialized and reallocated with a different value for element 1. Also, once my view controller gets popped off of the stack when the user continues to navigate through my app, if it gets called again all of these objects will get recreated from scratch so it usually wont matter. But I just want to make sure I am getting the concept anyways.p

Negative 1201 pI am using the latest version of the Google .NET Client API v1.81.

I have previously authenticated and the key is stored and retrieved via FileDataStore.p  pWhy would it be asking me to authenticate again The problem is because this code needs to run in a background service so it cant open browser tabs. p  pAnother issue I now am getting, when I try and authorise it opens up a new browser window, I select my credentials but the login page then tells mep  pThe redirect URI in the request codehttplocalhost51773authorizecode did not match a registered redirect URIp  pWhy is it trying to use the Authorize url and not the AuthCallbackController. It also seems to randomly change the port number of the redirect uri making registering it impossible.p  pThe ultimate question probably is, if I have a web app and I want the users to sign in using their credentials via the web page and then reuse those credentials at a later date in a background task on the server, how do I go about that I couldnt find any relevant sample app to show how. It appears the FileDataStore does not store the credentials so they can be reused. I have also implemented my own DataStore which saves them in the database which doesnt seem to work either. p  pDigging further into this it appears I need offlineaccess. I have implemented this the same as a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions22094599googleanalyticsoauthwithaccesstypeofflineincsharpGoogle Analytics OAuth with AccessType  Offline in Ca but it still prompts.

Negative 1201 pIn Oracle 10g, I have a SQL which executes reasonably fasteraround 3040 mins approx today. When the same SQL was executed two days back, it took around 2.5 hours for the SQL to get completed. I thought the querys execution plan might have changed. But that was NOT the case. Both execution plans matched. So with DBAs help I got the AWR report generated to find the database activity during the period. Sure enough, this long running query featured along with couple other queries. In the AWR, this query featured in high number of buffer gets, disk reads list but there were atleast four other queries that were even higherthey constituted 98 together. In fact the top query in both lists were around 50  of buffer gets and 80 of disk reads while mine took only about 2 and 0.9 respectively. My query did not feature in any other lists including CPU time and Parsed calls.p  pSo my question  Is it possible that  high amount of buffer gets and disk reads by other queries impact my querys performancep
Negative 1201 pThe best solution for hiding views with the new Autolayout is definitely to create height constraint for the view, connect it and create an outlet for it, and change self.myViewHeightConstriant.constant equals to 0. But suppose the view contains some other views, suppose an imageView and some label below it. Now, the imageView is 10px away from the top and has top space to superview constraint with 10px value. Trying to hide container UIView with constant  0 shows an error in consolep  precodeUnable to simultaneously satisfy constraints. Probably at least one of the constraints in the following list is one you dont want.    Try this 1 look at each constraint and try to figure out which you dont expect  2 find the code that added the unwanted constraint or constraints and fix it.    Note If youre seeing NSAutoresizingMaskLayoutConstraints that you dont  understand, refer to the documentation for the UIView property  translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints      ltNSLayoutConstraint0xc7cedb0 V[UIView0xc7ce1e00]gt,    ltNSLayoutConstraint0xc7ceea0 V[UIImageView0xc7ce270]0   Names  UIView0xc7ce1e0 gt,    ltNSLayoutConstraint0xc7cef30 V10[UIImageView0xc7ce270]   Names UIView0xc7ce1e0 gt   Will attempt to recover by breaking constraint     ltNSLayoutConstraint0xc7ceea0 V[UIImageView0xc7ce270]0   Names UIView0xc7ce1e0 gt  codepre  pThe guess the problem is container UIView has height 0, but the imageView has top space offset 10px from it and Autolayout engine doesnt understand how to handle this situation. Tried to set clipSubviews for container view but that didnt help. Any ideasp  pstrongUPDATEstrong several thoughts, creating an outlet topSpaceToSuperView constraint for the imageView and set its constaint also to 0 doesnt look very appealing. There should be more elegant solution than trashing the code with multiple outlets...p

Negative 1201 pI have the following classp  precodepublic class ResourceInfo      public string Id  get set      public string Url  get set   codepre  pwhich contains information about some resource. Now I need the possibility to check if two such resources are equal by the following scenario Ive implemented IEquatable interfacep  precodepublic class ResourceInfo  IEquatableltResourceInfogt      public string Id  get set      public string Url  get set       public bool EqualsResourceInfo other              if other  null             return false           Try to match by Id         if string.IsNullOrEmptyId ampamp string.IsNullOrEmptyother.Id                      return string.EqualsId, other.Id, StringComparison.InvariantCultureIgnoreCase                     Match by Url if cant match by Id         return string.EqualsUrl, other.Url, StringComparison.InvariantCultureIgnoreCase       codepre  pUsage codeoneResource.EqualsotherResourcecode. And everything is just fine. But some time have passed and now I need to use such eqaulity comparing in some linq query.p  pAs a result I need to implement separate Equality comparer which looks like thisp  precodeclass ResourceInfoEqualityComparer  IEqualityComparerltResourceInfogt      public bool EqualsResourceInfo x, ResourceInfo y              if x  null  y  null             return object.Equalsx, y          return x.Equalsy           public int GetHashCodeResourceInfo obj              if obj  null             return 0          return obj.GetHashCode       codepre  pSeems to be ok it makes some validation logic and uses the native equality comparing logic. But then I need to implement GetHashCode method in the codeResourceInfocode class and that is the place where I have some problem.p  pI dont know how to do this correctly without changing the class itself. p  pAt first glance, the following example can workp  precodepublic override int GetHashCode       Try to get hashcode from Id     ifstring.IsNullOrEmptyId         return Id.GetHashCode      Try to get hashcode from url     ifstring.IsNullOrEmptyUrl         return Url.GetHashCode       Return zero     return 0  codepre  pBut this implementation is not very good.p  pGetHashCode should match the Equals method  if two objects are equal, then they should have the same hashcode, right But my Equals method uses two objects to compare them. Here is the usecase, where you can see the problem itselfp  precodevar resInfo1  new ResourceInfo      Id  null,     Url  httpres.comid1  var resInfo2  new ResourceInfo      Id  id1,     Url  httpres.comid1  codepre  pSo, what will happen, when we invoke Equals method obviously they will be equal, because Equals method will try to match them by Id and fail, then it tries matching by Url and here we have the same values. As intended.p  precoderesInfo1.EqualsresInfo1  gt true codepre  pBut then, if they are equal, they should have the same hash codesp  precodevar hash1  resInfo.GetHashCode  263327347 var hash2  resInfo.GetHashCode  1511443452  hash1.GetHashCode  hash2.GetHashCode gt false codepre  pShortly speaking, the problem is that codeEqualscode method decides which field to use for equality comparing by looking at two different objects, while codeGetHashCodecode method have access only to one object.p  pIs there a way to implement it correctly or I just have to change my class to avoid such situationsp  pMany thanks.p

Negative 1201 pI am just learning Interface Segregation Principle. But after learning i am confused with the scenario in the example.p  pThe concept is  separating the interfaces into simple interfaces. That is well but my question is with hierarchy model or notp  pTake the example i studied in the book.p  pI have one Interface for product with the following propertiesp  precodepublic interface IProduct  decimal Price  get set  decimal WeightInKg  get set  int Stock  get set  int Certification  get set  int RunningTime  get set   codepre  pI just simplify with one class implmentation from the interfacep  precodepublic class DVD  IProduct  public decimal Price  get set  public decimal WeightInKg  get set  public int Stock  get set  public int Certification  get set  public int RunningTime  get set   codepre  pThe problem is when apply to the other categories which have not related properties. When create a class for TShirt, there is no needed for Certification and RunningTime. So as per the Interface Segregation Principle, the interface is separated like belowp  pCreate a new interface, move the movie related properties to this one like belowp  precodepublic interface IMovie  int Certification  get set  int RunningTime  get set   codepre  pSo the IProduct does not have these properties and the implementation like belowp  precodepublic class TShirt  IProduct  public decimal Price  get set  public decimal WeightInKg  get set  public int Stock  get set    public class DVD  IProduct, IMovie  public decimal Price  get set  public decimal WeightInKg  get set  public int Stock  get set  public int Certification  get set  public int RunningTime  get set   codepre  pConceptionally i am ok with this.  But if this about real method implementation like this. When i use dependency injection which interface i used as the type for DVD class.p  pI am confused or i missing something  If i apply the inheritance logic we can use the lower level interface so base interface also inherited. But if i use like this how can implementp

Negative 1201 pWorking on a project for a client, and an aspect of this job is to utilize sessions for individual users on a series of separate websites.p  pUnfortunately, all of the sudden, Im running into innumerable issues with this approach. Mechanize doesnt like cookies obviously, because there is JS involved.p  pThe next choice would be to utilize something like Watir or Capybara to work around this problem. This is what I originally had done, but my client was not satisfied with the speed.p  pSo, questionsp  ol liIs there a good way to get this done wo using a browserdriver and without deeply analyzing the JS of each website, reverseengineering their cookie setting process, and reimplementing that in our codebase my guess absolutely notli liIf not, what would be the best way around this problem my guess browserdriver, like Watir or Capybarali liIf my guesses to questions 1 and 2 sound correct to you, then how can I convince this client that I know what Im sayingli ol  pIts quite irritating to be hired to develop something on the magnitude of difficulty that I was hired to develop, and then to have your recommendations and insight be ignored. How can I better handle this problemp  pThis probably isnt a great question for Stack Overflow, and I apologize for that. I find myself coming here for help quite a bit. You guys usually have good answers. Thank you in advance for answering, if you do.p  pstrongEDITstrong To be a bit clearer, the issue is one of speed vs. reliability. He wants the utmost speed. Obviously, a browserdriver is not going to be the best speed, but it does sort of guarantee, in a way, that you can persist a given session. Mechanize is much speedier, but requires much more finnicky diddling about to get things working correctly. Considering were working with dozens of websites, Im thinking the best route is to emsacrificeem speed and emgainem reliabilityaccuracy. What do you all thinkp  pUltimately, Im looking for your help, because Im at a loss for any more good arguments. I had plenty, but have exhausted them all, and he seems convinced that there is a way to do this without sacrificing either speed or accuracy at least with the amount of human resources invested [a.k.a me]. Ive tried explaining this, that we can have one or the other. Basically, as far as emIem know, we can only have one. The one we should choose is accuracy. How might I be able to argue this in a way that this person might listen more acutelyp

Negative 1201 pI have a complexed problem with python multiprocessing module. I have build a script that in one place has to call a multiargument function callfunction for each element in a specyfic list.

Now, I want each iteration to be carried out by single sub process, but there cannot be more than N subprocesses altogether. If so, main process should wait until 1 of subprocesses end and then perform another iteration. Also, callsumaryfunction need to be called after all the sub processes finish.p  pI have tried my best with multiprocessing module, Locks and global variables to keep the actual number of subprocesses running to compare to N but every time i get error.p  pEDITp  pFirstly, the main process codep  precodeMAXPROCESSES3 lockmultiprocessing.Lock processes0 k0 while k lt lenklist      if processesltMAXPROCESSES  running processes lt N set by me          p  multiprocessing.Processtargetsingleanalysis, argsklist[k],mainfolder,trainingtesting,subsets,positivename,ratiolist,lock,processes         p.start         k1      else time.sleep1   while processesgt0 time.sleep1 codepre  pNow the function that is called by multiprocessingp  precodedef singleanalysisk,mainfolder,trainingtesting,subsets,positivename,ratiolist,lock,processes  lock.acquire processes1 lock.release  stuff to do  lock.acquire processes1 lock.release codepre  pI get the Error that int value processes variable is always equal to 0, since codesingleanalysiscode function seems to create new, local variable codeprocessescode.

Negative 1201 pI have a directory, code.grdfileslat36code that has 7 files in it coden36e114.grdcode, coden36e115.grdcode, coden36e116.grdcode, coden36e117.grdcode, coden36e118.grdcode, coden36e119.grdcode, coden36e120.grdcode. Also beneath code.grdfilescode are other folders named codelat37code, codelat38code, codelat39code. Each contains some files named in the same format as those in codelat36code, only instead of coden36e114.grdcode, the file for the codee114code longitude in the codelat37code folder would be called coden37e114code. Now, not all lat folders contain all the longitudes, but I need them to.p  pI have written a part of the script to determine which lat folder has the most columns in it it is codelat36code with 7 longitudes. I want to compare the longitudes that exist in codelat36code folder to the other folders, and if a column is missing in another folder, I will make it. I can handle the codeif thencode statement, but I am stumped on how to compare the lists in bash.p  pemI was thinking to make a list of the file names in the coderow1code folder, and compare that to the to the files in the other folders, but the names wont and shouldnt match  only the column part of the name will and should match. So far I have tried to make an array of the file names and then parse it for just the column part of the name. Note that these are actually map tiles, so the names are really in the format of coordinates in northing row and easing col e.g. coden36e114.grdcode. So I want to isolate all the codee114code style parts of the names and check and make sure that they exist in the other rows. I hope that makes sense. Below is what I attempted, but I am not great in bash syntax so Im stumped. Thanks so much for the help.      collistraw find maxdirectory name em.grd exec basename  .grd       collist for c in collistraw[] do echo collistraw[c]37 done  where codemaxdirectorycode is the one with the most columns. p  hr  pUPDATE I have removed what I described in italics above and attempted to incorporate the solution from John1024. Below is the code.p  precodecd .grdfiles   for row in lat     do         ls row   sed s.lonlon gtrow.tmp done for f in lat.tmp     do         grep vFf f latXX.tmp gtmissing.tmp         [ s missing.tmp ] ampamp echo f.tmp is missing cat missing.tmp done cd .. codepre  pWhere codelatXXcode is the folder with the most longitudes. John1024s first loop works nicely, and I get the correct lists for each of the codelatcode folders, but the second loop straight up compares the lists , returningp  precodelat37 is missing n36e114.grd n36e115.grd n36e116.grd n36e117.grd n36e118.grd n36e119.grd n36e120.grd lat38 is missing n36e114.grd n36e115.grd n36e116.grd n36e117.grd n36e118.grd n36e119.grd n36e120.grd lat39 is missing n36e114.grd n36e115.grd n36e116.grd n36e117.grd n36e118.grd n36e119.grd n36e120.grd codepre  pI need that loop to compare only empartem of the file name. ie I want to check each folder for the existence of each longitude. So that if file n37e114.grd exists, nothing happens, but if it does not exist, that information is returned and I can execute a command based on the missing file. I hope my edits clear up the naming convention and are understandable. Thanks again for the help. AMp  hr  pSOLUTIONp  pthanks to the help of John1024 I was able to find a solution.

And contrived example might something like thisp  precodeBEGIN TRAN input for test case DECLARE TestName VARCHAR10  bob insert test row INSERT INTO tbl data values TestName display initial state of target row SELECT  FROM tbl WHERE data  TestName do some useful test EXEC MyProc display the final state of the target row SELECT  FROM tbl WHERE data  TestName put the db back where it started ROLLBACK TRAN codepre  pNow Im working with Oracle and PLSQL and Im trying to use a some similar pattern to test my work and not finding it obvious to me quite how to do that. I believe there are a few different ways I might accomplish it but havent gotten anything to actually work. Ideally I would have a single script in which I could run multiple test cases and inspect the result.p  pI am trying to work in PLSQL Developer at this point and understand that might have some differences from how it might work in Oracle SQL Developer or elsewhere. p

Negative 1201 pI created a generic USB HID comms driver capable of monitoring USB events and sendingreceiving data packets to and from devices. Ive been using it successfully since my codeWinFormscode days as much of the code was culled from MSDN and implemented very similarly to the way suggested a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions16245706checkfordevicechangeaddremoveeventsherea. My question is The examples I see continue to rely on what seem to be the old Windows Messaging architecture, i.e. codeSystem.Runtime.InteropServicescode, WMxxxxxxx type messages, registeringhandling these in a purely codeC WPFcode app with codeHwndHandlercode, overriding codeWndProccode, etc. I was wondering is there not a way to handle USB events using a more modern, eventdriven approach, say with codedelegatescode, subscribing to codeEventHandlerscode, etc Even a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions624367howtohandlewndprocmessagesinwpfthisa SO posts suggest refraining from using such archaic methods and I imagine there must be a solution for USB events as well. Thanx.p

That was fixed and it displays fontpreference when clicked. The listener is working but I want to extract the value of the entry the user clicks on, not the key of the entire preference. Is there a method for doing thatp

Negative 1201 pSo were trying to create an across activity image transition from an image in a ListView, to an image in a ViewPager gallery.In doing this transition were seeing the animation happen before the ViewPager finishes loadingdrawing. This causes the image on the ViewPager to flash making the animation look bad.p  pAs a test we put an image overtop to fake the look of the ViewPager being loaded. We then transition from the image in the ListView to this dummy ImageView, and then hide it after the transition is complete. This helped but still didnt create a smooth experience since things would flash once the ViewPager finished drawing.p  pAny tips would be appreciatedp

Negative 1201 pSo Im new to the coding world and I basically have one query. Ive created two html docs, codeindex.htmlcode and codeindex1.htmlcodep  pIve managed to make these two link with my css and js so that both index files use one set of assets, but I want to copy the content from index1 and place it inside of index.html. p  pWhen I do this, the content isnt like it was when it was in my index1 file. The whole look changes and my content is spread out everywhere.p  pWhat am I doing wrong Obviously copy paste is not an option here.p

Negative 1201 pIm developing a small game in flexas3 for iOS, Android and Desktop, im using flexas3 and ADT to compile and package the app.p  pThe problem that Im having only happen on iOS and its related with sound. All the sounds work perfectly during the app the ones that are included in the SWFs and the loaded from external folder. When I leave the iPadiPhone with the app opened, eventually it goes to sleep. After I return to the app, I havent sound and only came back not always after 1 or 2 minutes and pressing some buttons. I set the log to print before play any sound and look fine, with any error. I also have some figure that moves while the sound is playing and works great, except no sound.p  pThis is a bit annoying, because the workaround I had to do is to enable the KeepAwake. If I restart the app I set the to exit on suspend the sound its back p  pAny hints on this Can anyone helpp  pThanks in adavance.p
Negative 1201 pWhen the program is running in the foreground, it works fine.

Negative 1201 pI am using PHP and an external XML file to display an HTML page which allows a user to update an items status using various forminput buttons.p  pThe current format is that you can look at one HTML page with a master list of items and their status, then click on one to move to a new HTML page letting you specify the status of that item. So I can click on Widget X, then see a new page status.phpidX, then click on a button labeled ready, and PHP will use GET[id] to find the relevant XML node and replace its  attribute with ready.p  pFor some reason I absolutely cannot get PHP to use the data from GET to specify an XML node. Here is the current troubleshooting codep  precodeltphp     idx  GET[id] Get id from previous page     xml  simplexmlloadfiletest.xml Load external .xml     array  array100, 200, 300 Basic array for comparison    printrxml Display contents of test.xml xmlgtitem[idx]gtstatus  waiting change item idxs status to waiting  echo ltbrgt  printrxml Display changed xml    Display changed basic array values to confirm idx has a value   array[idx]  123 echo ltbrgt   printrarray   array[idx]  456 echo ltbrgt   printrarray   array[idx]  789 echo ltbrgt   printrarray gt codepre  pAnd here is the contents of test.xmlp  precodeltxml version1.0 standaloneyesgt ltwidgetsgt     ltitemgt             ltnamegtWidget Xltnamegt             ltstatusgtreadyltstatusgt     ltitemgt     ltitemgt             ltnamegtWidget Zltnamegt             ltstatusgtwaitingltstatusgt     ltitemgt ltwidgetsgt codepre  pThe basic array has no problem using idx  GET[id] to choose which array element to change.

Negative 1201 pI have around 10 workers that performs a job that includes the followingp  precodeuser  User.findorinitializebyemail someemailaddress.com  if user.newrecord  ... some code here that does something taking around 5 seconds or so elsif user.persisted  ... some code here that does something taking around 5 seconds or so end  user.save codepre  pThe problem is that at certain times, two or more workers run this code at the exact time, and thus I later found out that two or more Users have the same codeemailcode, in which I should always end up only unique emails.p  pIt is not possible for my situation to create DB Unique Indexes for codeemailcode as unique emails are conditional  some Users should have unique email, some do not. p  pIt is noteworthy to mention that my codeUsercode model has uniqueness validations, but it still doesnt help me because, between code.findorinitializebycode and code.savecode, there is a code that is dependent if the user object is already created or not.p  pI tried Pessimistic and Optimistic locking, but it didnt help me, or maybe I just didnt implement it properly... should you have some suggestions regarding this.p  pThe solution I can only think of is to lock the other threads Sidekiq jobs whenever these lines of codes get executed, but I am not too sure how to implement this nor do I  know if this is even a suggestable approach.p  pI would appreciate any help.p  pEDITp  pIn my specific case, it is gonna be hard to put email parameter in the job, as this job is a little more complex than what was just said above. The job is actually an export script in which a section of the job is the code above. I dont think its also possible to separate the functionality above into another separate worker... as the whole job flow should be serial and that no parts should be processed parallely  asynchronously. This job is just one of the jobs that are managed by another job, in which ultimately is managed by the master job.p

Negative 1201 pRight now Im trying to get along with a vote form in a way similar to Eurovision Songcontest Votes, eg you have a couple of things to choose for but only a fixed number of options to choose from where each option can only be used once.

Negative 1201 pIm pretty much breaking my head over this one. Im running an exact ams Debian system as several other I am managing with the same kernel and same setup, however, the files being created by my java process running as a private user arent getting the execute permission for the owner by default, which breaks the process.p  pThe umask is 0022, so thats correct, Ive tried setting up ACLs, but those seem to be getting ignored. The setup of the users itself also completely matches the setup on other machines where it does work. It starts the java process trough sudo for the specific user.  Im pretty much at the end of what I can think of.p

Negative 1201 pI am encountering Python crashes in certain IDEs, such as PyDev or PyCharm, when in debug mode and when the debugger is at a breakpoint refreshing the variables display.  p  pMy environment involves a C Dll with .NET extensions that are imported into IronPython, then exposed to Python through an RPyC connection. We need the IronPython layer to achieve the loading of the Dll and import of the APIs, then we need the Python layer because of many libraries that are not supported in IronPython.  RPyC is the gateway that allows Python to use the IronPython and C APIs.p  pThe code executes correctly in each IDE ie when not debugging, and via a python command prompt.  Even the debugging used to work with PyDev version 2.7.1.2012100913. But the newer PyDev versions are not working.   p  pAs soon as the debugger stops at a breakpoint, I get the Python has stopped working message and execution stops.p  pI have tried to debug the problem but cannot get beyond the RPyC connection SyncRequest.  At one point I thought I was running into WeakRef instances that got garbage collected, but I can see no way to provefix this.p  pCould this problem be a failure in the way the IDE uses the RPyC connection  In my mind, it seems that the IDE is using background threads to fetch the current attribute values via introspection, and this process through the RPyC connection is crashing. p  pDoes anyone have any explanations or suggestions Thanks.p

Negative 1201 pIm trying to implement a classification algorithm SVM on ECG signals downloaded from Physionet a hrefhttpphysionet.orgphysiobankdatabasecudb relnofollowhttpphysionet.orgphysiobankdatabasecudba in Matlab. Ive downloaded the individual .dat, .hea and .atr files for all the 35 samples. Each sample is around 8 minutes long. To train the classifier, I need 1 sec samples along with their class belongings so that the svmtrain function in matlab can use them. Im confused about how I can extract this required data.  Ive read previous questions and tried rddata.m a hrefhttpwww.physionet.orgphysiotoolsmatlabrddata.m relnofollowhttpwww.physionet.orgphysiotoolsmatlabrddata.ma. This code gives me several problems. Firstly, the sampling frequency of signal is 250 Hz but when I put SAMPLES2READ2500, 20s long signals are read instead of 10. Secondly, I still cant understand how to get large number of 1s samples from the original signals along with the attributes which can be used to train the SVM.p  pAny help is appreciated..p  pPS1 In order to get .atr,.dat and .hea files, I had to individually download the zip files for all 35 samples. If any knowledge about a faster, convenient way to do this is available, please enlighten.p  pPS2 The research paper from which im implementing the algorithm says that i can even use 5s or 10s long samples. But then that duration would contain multiple class belongings for multiple peaks in each signal. What would be the class belonging of the sample then Any suggestions on how this can be implementedp

Negative 1201 pI bought the shittiest book EVER to learn android programming.

I checked in the R file but I couldnt find it. I checked in every file. Nowhere to find. The answer I get from Wiley customer support wasp  pPlease reference a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidwidgetRemoteViews.html relnofollowhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidwidgetRemoteViews.htmla  setOnClickPendingIntentint viewId, PendingIntent pendingIntent Equivalent to calling setOnClickListenerandroid.view.View.OnClickListener to launch the provided PendingIntent. When setting the onclick action of items within collections eg. ListView, StackView etc., this method will not work. Instead, use link RemoteViewssetPendingIntentTemplateint, PendingIntent in conjunction with RemoteViewssetOnClickFillInIntentint, Intent. Parameters viewId     The id of the view that will trigger the PendingIntent when clicked pendingIntent     The PendingIntent to send when user clicks .p  pA dummy doesnt understand all that things. p  pIs it a typo or did I did something wrongp  pI didnt write the whole code.

Negative 1201 pSo I never would have used Djangos codeDecimalFieldcode option if I had known how difficult it would be to serialize my model data into JSON as a result.p  pLong story short, how do I get the float value from a codeDecimalFieldcodep  pMy model looks like thisp  precodeclass DailyReportmodels.Model     earnings  models.DecimalFieldmaxdigits12, decimalplaces4      def earningsfloatself         return self.earnings.tofloat codepre  pObviously there is no codetofloatcode method available, so what do I do insteadp  pBELOW IS LATER ADDITIONp  pThis worksp  precodeclass DailyReportmodels.Model     earnings  models.DecimalFieldmaxdigits12, decimalplaces4      def earningsfloatself         return floatself.earnings codepre  pBut even this seems too complicated.  Im trying to use djangorestframework for all the serializing, since Im using it for restframework stuff in my app generally.  In this particular case Id just like to transform and serialize my data into python lists and dictionaries and then store them as documents in Mongo DB via pymongo 3.p

Negative 1201 pFirst of all, I could not find a better title to describe my problem, sorry for that. Maybe someone could suggest a better title.p  pI have the following codep  precodegridSize  gridResolution  1 . gridStepSize positionsVectorY  gridSize1  2  gridStepSize1  gridSize1  2 positionsVectorX  gridSize2  2  gridStepSize2  gridSize2  2 [ gridPositionMatrixY, gridPositionMatrixX ]  ndgridpositionsVectorY, positionsVectorX codepre  pThis code works fine for me if codegridSize1code  0, codegridSize2code  0 and if codegridResolution1code  1, codegridResolution2code  1. However, if  that is not the case, the matrix  matrices are empty. For example, code[y, x]  ndgrid[], 1  3code returns empty matrices codeEmpty matrix 0by3code. What I would need in that case is code[y, x]  ndgrid0, 1  3code.p  pSo, my question is What is the best way to change the above code to create the desired matricesp  pI could simply check if codepositionsVectorYcode is empty and replace it with zeros. But Im wondering if there is a more elegant solution to this.p  pThank you, p  pAdrianp  pstrongEDIT An examplestrong p  pHere is an example where my code worksp  precodepositionsVectorY  1  2 positionsVectorX  1  3 [y, x]  ndgridpositionsVectorY, positionsVectorX codepre  pThe output isp  precodey        1     1     1      2     2     2   x        1     2     3      1     2     3 codepre  pAnd here is a special case where it does not work If the resolution in y direction is 1, and the size of the grid is 0 in y direction, then my code generates an empty array codepositionsVectorYcode. Then p  precodepositionsVectorY  []  positionsVectorX  1  3 [y, x]  ndgridpositionsVectorY, positionsVectorX codepre  pThe output is p  precodey      Empty matrix 0by3   x      Empty matrix 0by3 codepre  pThat is not what I want, I want that my code generatesp  precodepositionsVectorY  0     instead  of []  positionsVectorX  1  3 [y, x]  ndgridpositionsVectorY, positionsVectorX codepre  pin this special case, with the outputp  precodey        0     0     0   x        1     2     3 codepre  pWhat I want in the end, is to modify my code so it works for the general case, but also for the special case where the resolution in y or x direction can be 1. My temporary solution is using ifstatements, p  precodeifisemptypositionsVectorY     positionsVectorY  0 end  ifisemptypositionsVectorX     positionsVectorX  0 end codepre  pBut I would like to remove them and do it in a more elegant way.p

Negative 1201 pIm working with ArcObjects to set up a batch import from xls and csv files into a geodatabase. That part works fine, but after the import, I want to delete the file. This, however, doesnt work, because the file is still open. None of the interfaces being used descend from IDisposable or expose a Close method. Ive also tried using a ComReleaser to force close all of the COM objects that I open, but that doesnt work either. The only things Ive seen pertaining to closing a connection say that I need to remove all references to these types and force garbage collection, which is against standards for good reason.p  pHeres the method Im using for the excel importp  precodeprivate ServiceResultltIEnumerableltintgtgt InsertControlsFromXlsFileInfo xlsFile    ServiceResultltIEnumerableltintgtgt result  new ServiceResultltIEnumerableltintgtgt     usingComReleaser comReleaser  new ComReleaser       read in the spreadsheet as a workspace     Type factoryType  Type.GetTypeFromProgIDesriDataSourcesOleDB.ExcelWorkspaceFactory     IWorkspaceFactory workspaceFactory  IWorkspaceFactoryActivator.CreateInstancefactoryType      IWorkspace workspace  workspaceFactory.OpenFromFilexlsFile.FullName, 0     IFeatureWorkspace remoteWorkspace  IFeatureWorkspaceOpenWorkspace     IFeatureWorkspace featureWorkspace  IFeatureWorkspaceworkspace     IWorkspaceEdit2 session  IWorkspaceEdit2remoteWorkspace     IMultiuserWorkspaceEdit multiuserWorkspace  IMultiuserWorkspaceEditremoteWorkspace      comReleaser.ManageLifetimeworkspaceFactory     comReleaser.ManageLifetimeworkspace     comReleaser.ManageLifetimeremoteWorkspace     comReleaser.ManageLifetimefeatureWorkspace     comReleaser.ManageLifetimesession     comReleaser.ManageLifetimemultiuserWorkspace      try        session.StartEditingfalse       multiuserWorkspace.StartMultiuserEditingesriMultiuserEditSessionMode.esriMESMVersioned       session.StartEditOperation        Match tableMatch  tableRecReg.MatchxlsFile.Name       string tableName  tableMatch.Success  tableMatch.Groups[1].Value    Sheet1        ITable table  featureWorkspace.OpenTabletableName        result.Value  CopyAllFeaturestable, remoteWorkspace.OpenFeatureClassAppSettings.DefaultSchema  .

Negative 1201 pI have a MySQL instance running on an EC2.  I have a Rails app running on a separate EC2. p  pWhen I start both services, the rails app can talk to MySQL, but after a while MySQL stops responding to the Rails app. If I restart MySQL, it starts listening to the Rails app again, but then stops responding after a while. If I log in to the MySQL EC2, and connect to mysql from the same user from local, it works. It just doesnt respond to the remote user. What could be wrong p

Negative 1201 pI am running Windows 8.1 on an iMac with Yosemite OS in a Virtual Box using v4.3.3 and programming with WinForms using Visual Studio 2013 in C. My form application now from a button click sends Win32 messages to the operating system to move the mouse pointer around the screen. I have studied this pretty carefully  the MSDN documentation, etc.  and have implemented many solutions I have found on the web. They all seem to work fine .. and so does my own .. except for one thing Wheneverwherever I place the cursor on the screen, get its position and begin moving it around following it in various ways  e.g., watching CURSORINFO, etc. the cursor image itself say, initially an arrow remains fixed in the place I left it on the screen. It DOES NOT MOVE.p  pThe cursor positionmouse positionhot spotetc. DOES move around. My cursor image stuck where I left it changes as the cursor position moves over various sections of open applications that capture it. Icons on the desktop highlight as the cursor position moves over them. I can send mouseclick messages to activate them, drag them, etc. Everything seems to work just fine .. except the cursor image is not being redraw after each SendInputforamousemovement message. BTW That function returns just fine without error.p  pThis has become rather frustrating and surprising to me that I find nothing to speak of yet on the Internet about other programmers having this kind of problem. The first sentence in the MSDN mouse input documentation says more or less when it receives a mousemove event message, the operating system moves the cursor position and redraws it there on the screen... Yes, well ... it is not doing that for me. This may have something to do with the virtual machine .. its input device is set for PS2 mouse and I have tried toggling the host key, etc.p  pThis application is for persons with disabilities who need to move the mouse around using alternative input devices. I would appreciate any suggestions and will share code if someone would like to see that.p

Negative 1201 pI am working on a ASPX website driven by SQL Server. One of the functions of the website is to run some reports on the backend database and spit the results out to the user.

Negative 1201 pI have the following strange situation.p  pWe have a process, call it Distributor, that receives tasks over ZeroMQTCP from Client, and accumulates them in a queue. There is a Worker process, which talks with the Distributor over ZeroMQIPC. The Distributor forwards each incoming task to Worker, and waits for an answer. As soon as the Worker answers, it sends it another task if there was one received in the mean time, and returns the answer to the Client over a separate ZeroMQTCP connection. If a task was not processed within 10ms, it is dropped from the queue.p  pWith 1 Worker, the system is capable to process strong3,500 requestssecstrong. The client sends 10,000 requestssec, so 6,500 requests are dropped.p  pBut  when Im running some unrelated process on the server, which takes 100 CPU a busy wait loop, or whatever  then, strangely, the system can suddenly process strong7,000 requestssecstrong. When the process is stopped, it returns back to 3,500. The server has 4 cores.p  pThe same happens when running 2, 3 or 4 Workers connected to the same Distributor, with slightly different numbers.p  pThe Distributor is written in C. The Worker is written in Python, and uses pyzmq binding. The worker process is a simple arithmetic process, and does not depend on any external IO other than Distributor.p  pThere is a theory that this has to do with ZeroMQ using threads on separate CPUs when the server is free, and the same CPU when its busy. If this is the case, I would appreciate an idea how to configure threadCPU affinity of ZeroMQ so that it works correctly without running a busy loop in background.p  pIs there any ZeroMQ setting that might explain  fix thisp  h2EDITh2  pThis doesnt happen with a Worker written in C.p

Negative 1201 pSo I have a modular solution which is deployed in a few different places.p  pProject 1 is my MVC portal website.p  pProject 2 is a Console application deployed on an Azure VM running windows server.p  pProject 3 is a repository class library referenced by both.p  pProject 2 uses Project 1 via the Repository.p  pI have recently run into problems as I work onexpand functionality in my MVC site, the database backing it incurs changes. The way I access the site from my Repository is referencing the DbContext class and interacting with the database via that.p  pSo obviously when I make changes to my database structure in Project 1 I run into problems with Project 2 throwing errors on the server about the database backing the context having changed.p  pA solution to this is obviously not to access the database via the DbContext and run queries referencing specific tables which will not change unless the service in Project 2 changes.p  pI have considered this, but using EF simplifies the operations I perform so much that I would prefer complicating my deployment than writing the SQL queries and doing it like that.p  pIs there another option here or will I just have to rebuild Project 2 and deploy every time I make changes to the Database backing Project 1 Its not that big a deal its just an inconvenience that Im curious if I can avoid.p

Negative 1201 pIm trying to encapsulate the ugliness that is the Document API within an Activity subclass so I can call a simple delete, copy, etc without having to manage the persisted permissions at every file manipulation code block.

If its not a timeout in IE11 then could it be a timeout setting in the firewall, or a router on the networkp
