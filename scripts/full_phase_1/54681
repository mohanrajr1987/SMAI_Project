Positive 54681 pIm having random crashes in my Xamarin Android app which result in native Android stacktraces. These stacktraces contain little actual information and I have no idea on how to continue from here.p  pSome background info App mainly shows lists of remote http images throughout different fragments and activities. App is based on MvvmCross and mainly uses MvxRecyclerview  MvxImageView to show the images. Crashes occur after scrolling and navigating through some lists. Crash mainly happens when returning to an activity on the backstack.p  pMy best guess is that images are being disposed while actually still in use. However, when forcing the images to dispose even when in use, this does not result in a crash but rather in images not showing up. So Im not sure about my theory anymore.p  pWhat can I do to get more information out of this stacktracep  pStacktracep  precode[monort]  [monort] Attempting native Android stacktrace [monort]  [monort] at 0 [0xb6fa9dbf] [monort] at 0 [0xb6f94838] [monort] at 0 [0xb6f94247] [monort] at 0 [0xb6f947e8] [monort] at 0 [0xb6f94247] [monort] at 0 [0xb6f947e8] [monort] at 0 [0xb6f94247] [monort] at 0 [0xb6f947e8] [monort] at 0 [0xb6f94247] [monort] at 0 [0xb6f947e8] [monort] at 0 [0xb6f94247] [monort] at 0 [0xb6f947e8] [monort] at 0 [0xb6f94247] [monort] at 0 [0xb6f947e8] [monort] at 0 [0xb6f94247] [monort] at 0 [0xb6f947e8] [monort] at 0 [0xb6f94247] [monort] at 0 [0xb6f947e8] [monort] at 0 [0xb6f94247] [monort] at 0 [0xb6f947e8] [monort] at 0 [0xb6f94247] [monort] at 0 [0xb6f947e8] [monort] at 0 [0xb6f94247] [monort] at 0 [0xb6f947e8] [monort] at 0 [0xb6f94247] [monort] at 0 [0xb6f947e8] [monort] at 0 [0xb6f94247] [monort] at ZN7android10uirenderer10RenderNode11prepareTreeERNS08TreeInfoE73 [0xb6f946a9] [monort] at ZN7android14RootRenderNode11prepareTreeERNS10uirenderer8TreeInfoE44 [0xb7671dec] [monort] at 44 [0xb6fadf5a] [monort] at 44 [0xb6fb0010] [monort] at ZN7android10uirenderer12renderthread12RenderThread10threadLoopEv153 [0xb6fb4cc9] [monort] at ZN7android6Thread11threadLoopEPv398 [0xb74219de] [monort] at ZN7android14AndroidRuntime15javaThreadShellEPv98 [0xb7623c62] [monort] at ZN13threaddatat10trampolineEPKS122 [0xb74210fa] [monort] at ZL15pthreadstartPv56 [0xb749c218] [monort] at startthread25 [0xb7497599] [monort] at bionicclone70 [0xb748e166] [monort]  [monort]  [monort] Got a SIGSEGV while executing native code.

Positive 54681 pI want to install Xamarin for Android Development in Visual Studio 2015 Enterprise.p  pWhile installing, Xamarin told me that I was missing a lot of features, so it would download and install them for me. The download size was around 2GB, and I have a really slow internet.p  pI wanted to know if there is a way to download Xamarin and all required components separately, using some download manager like IDM, and then be able to use it later to reinstallinstall on another PC.p  pAlso, I was able to find offline setups for JRE and JDK, and also Android Studio and Android SDKNDK, but still, the download size is around 1.5GB, which I presume is for the required Android SDK libraries, APIs and tools.p  pSo, I am just asking for a guide on downloading all the components and store them for installing later.p

Positive 54681 pXamarin Studio was working perfect for me this morning, created a hello world app with no problem. p  pThen I started developing an App, when I tried to build it gave me back a warning about missing Xamarin.Android. Also, Up to this point, I was able to open options, and under projects was the SDK locations folder where you specify your SDK, NDK and Java files. This folder has now disappeared. p  pI cannot change my emulator to the Xamarin Player or any others its just stuck on default, none of my previous projects will run or newly created ones. I have uninstalled xamarin and tried reinstalling it to no avail.p  pVisual studio works perfectly running the solutions even using the Xamarin Player. I would much prefer to use Xamarin Studio for my fourth year project. p  pAny help with this would be much appreciated. p  pI also seen something about Xamarin is now running on Microsoft.Net mode in options, I cant create a mobile app the way I could this morning. It only gives me options to build in asp and one other.p

Negative 54681 pI have a linux box with a bank of modems and need to create demanddial outbound PPP connections to a very large set of remote machines.  Since I have far more remotes than local modems, Id like to launch one or more instances of codepppdcode in codedemandcode mode, but not allocate a particular modem until a connection is requested.  When the connection becomes idle, Id like codepppdcode to release the modem so it can be used for a connection to a different remote.p  pIve been through the codepppd mancode pages and understand the concepts of the codecallcode and codeconnectcode options, as well as the codeoptions.DEVICEcode files and the codeetcppppeerscode directory.  Lock files will tell me which modems are in use or available.  And Im able to connect to multiple remote peers as long as I hardcode the modem assignments.  But I havent found a way to assign them dynamically, say by calling a codegetavailablemodemcode script when codepppdcode needs to dial.  Google doesnt seem to know, either.p  pA workaround might be to detect the need to demanddial with an external mechanism, and then launch codepppdcode to service it, but it seems cleaner to leverage the facility within codepppdcode itself.p  pAny pointers or ideas are appreciated.

Negative 54681 pIm writing regression tests for a inhouse library where the creators are looong gone and Im trying to validate the environment.  A couple of the tests keep failing with that NameNotFoundException only when the jndi name is complex.p  pThis is a stand alone app and is not running with any web containers.

Negative 54681 h1Overviewh1  pI have a Microsoft Word AddIn, written in VBA Visual Basic for Applications, that compresses a document and all of its related contents embedded media into a zip archive.

Im not great at programming but with C I managed somehow to figure it out, without remembering how. It actually looks like an animation because when clicking the button, the height of one row smoothly goes down to 0. p  pBut Im trying to even reach that property and I cant figure out the context. The row is called AnimationRow and I can reach that, but where do I set the height And how would the syntax look likep

Negative 54681 pThe Android app Im currently developing has a main activity that has grown quite large. This is mainly because it contains a codeTabWidgetcode with 3 tabs. Each tab has quite a few components. The activity has to control of all those components at once. So I think you can imagine that this Activity has like 20 fields a field for almost every component. Also it contains a lot of logic click listeners, logic to fill lists, etc.p  pWhat I normally do in component based frameworks is to split everything up into custom components. Each custom component would then have a clear responsibility. It would contain its own set of components and all other logic related to that component.p  pI tried to figure out how this can be done, and I found something in the Android documentation what they like to call a Compound Control. See a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comguidetopicsuicustomcomponents.htmlcompoundhttpdeveloper.android.comguidetopicsuicustomcomponents.htmlcompounda and scroll to the Compound Controls section I would like to create such a component based on an XML file defining the view structure.p  pIn the documentation it saysp  blockquote   pNote that just like with an Activity,   you can use either the declarative   XMLbased approach to creating the   contained components, or you can nest   them programmatically from your code.p blockquote  pWell, thats good news The XMLbased approach is exactly what I want But it doesnt say how to do it, except that it is like with an Activity... But what I do in an Activity is call codesetContentView...code to inflate the views from XML. That method is not available if you for example subclass codeLinearLayoutcode.p  pSo I tried to inflate the XML manually like thisp  precodepublic class MyCompoundComponent extends LinearLayout       public MyCompoundComponentContext context, AttributeSet attributeSet          supercontext, attributeSet         LayoutInflater inflater  LayoutInflater context.getSystemServiceContext.LAYOUTINFLATERSERVICE         inflater.inflateR.layout.mylayout, this       codepre  pThis works, except for the fact that the XML Im loading has codeLinearLayoutcode declared as the root element. This results in the inflated codeLinearLayoutcode being a child of codeMyCompoundComponentcode which itself already is a codeLinearLayoutcode So now we have a redundant LinearLayout in between codeMyCompoundComponentcode and the views it actually needs.p  pCan somebody please provide me with a better way to approach this, avoiding having a redundant codeLinearLayoutcode instantiatedp

Negative 54681 pI think this is the question, anyway. I am using a RelayCommand, which decorates an ICommand with two delegates. One is Predicate for the canExecute and the other is Action for the execute method.p  pBackground motivation p  pThe motivation has to do with unit testing ViewModels for a a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiWindows5FPresentation5FFoundation relnofollowWPFa presentation. A frequent pattern is that I have one ViewModel that has an ObservableCollection, and I want a unit test to prove the data in that collection is what I expect given some source data which also needs to be converted into a collection of ViewModels. Even though the data in both collections looks the same in the debugger, it looks like the test fails due to an equality failure on the ViewModels RelayCommand. Heres an example of the failing unit testp  precode[Test]     public void CreationProjectActivitiesMatchFacade              var all  from activity in facade.ProjectActivities                    orderby activity.BusinessId                    select new ActivityViewModelactivity, facade.SubjectTimeSheet.ToList          var models  new ObservableCollectionltActivityViewModelgtall         CollectionAssert.AreEqualvm.ProjectActivities, models      codepre  p Back to delegate equality p  pHere is the code for the RelayCommand  its basically a direct ripoff of Josh Smiths idea, with an implementation for equality that I added in an attempt to solve this issuep  precodepublic class RelayCommand  ICommand, IRelayCommand      readonly Actionltobjectgt execute     readonly Predicateltobjectgt canExecute       ltsummarygtCreates a new command that can always execute.ltsummarygt     public RelayCommandActionltobjectgt execute  thisexecute, null         ltsummarygtCreates a new command which executes depending on the logic in the passed predicate.ltsummarygt     public RelayCommandActionltobjectgt execute, Predicateltobjectgt canExecute          Check.RequireNotNullltPredicateltobjectgtgtexecute, execute          execute  execute         canExecute  canExecute           [DebuggerStepThrough]     public bool CanExecuteobject parameter  return canExecute  null  true  canExecuteparameter       public event EventHandler CanExecuteChanged              add  CommandManager.RequerySuggested  value          remove  CommandManager.RequerySuggested  value            public void Executeobject parameter  executeparameter       public override bool Equalsobject obj              if ReferenceEqualsnull, obj return false         if ReferenceEqualsthis, obj return true         if obj.GetType  typeofRelayCommand return false         return EqualsRelayCommandobj           public bool EqualsRelayCommand other              if ReferenceEqualsnull, other return false         if ReferenceEqualsthis, other return true         return Equalsother.execute, execute ampamp Equalsother.canExecute, canExecute           public override int GetHashCode              unchecked                      return execute  null  execute.GetHashCode  0  397  canExecute  null  canExecute.GetHashCode  0                 codepre  pIn a unit test where Ive effectively set the execute delegate to the same method canExecute is null in both cases, the unit test fails at this linep  precodereturn Equalsother.execute, execute ampamp Equalsother.canExecute, canExecute codepre  pDebugger outputp  precodeexecute Method  Void ltgetCloseCommandgtb0System.Object base System.MulticastDelegate Method  Void CloseCommandgtb0System.Object  other.execute Method  Void ltgetCloseCommandgtb0System.Object  base System.MulticastDelegate Method  Void CloseCommandgtb0System.Object codepre  pCan anyone explain what I am missing and what the fix isp  p EDITED REMARKS p  pAs Mehrdad pointed out, the getCloseCommand from the debug session looks a bit weird at first.

Negative 54681 pWhen creating a Setup Project in Visual Studio you can specify that a file is Permanent, but there is no option for setting a folder as such. My installer needs to copy some files to an existing sometimes empty folder, but when it uninstalls it deletes the folder if its empty. Id like to prevent that so it doesnt break other addins. Right now Ive added a dummy.txt file and set it as permanent so the folder isnt deleted. Is there another wayp

The first dozen times or so this happened the heights totalled over 18000 hence the magic number above.

Negative 54681 pI have a WinForms application VS 2008, .NET 3.5 that has a form with two different group boxes, and inside of each group box are different sets of radio buttons.  When I run the application, the first group box automatically has the first radio button in it already selected, and the second group box does not have a radio button selected by default.p  pI have looked through all the properties of the radio buttons and the group boxes, and cannot figure out what the difference is between the two.

Negative 54681 pIm porting a class from plain JDBC to use Spring.  Part of this class consists of a block that find the most recent row, updates a field, and selects it into an object to be processed later.  This block should only be executed by one thread on one machine at a time to make sure no two threads process the same row. Weve been handling mutual exclusion by locking the table, but as part of the move to Spring would like to use the transaction management provided.p  pIs the codeDataSourceTransactionManagercode powerful enough to provide mutual exclusion in the case where our code is accessing the database from multiple machinesp

Id like to know if its possible to use the image URLs that I use for displaying the icons elsewhere in a tree control.p  pIve tried simply using the name of the field that contains the URL as the iconField on the tree control, but apparently when the flex framework sees a string field as the icon field it looks for a property on emthe mxml file containing the treeem with a name thats the same as the string value for the field on the tree item.

Negative 54681 pI take a fat JSON array from the server via an AJAX call, then process it and render HTML with Javascript. What I want is to make it as fast as humanly possible.p  pChrome leads over FF in my tests but it can still take 58 seconds for the browser to render 300 records.p  pI considered lazyloading such as that implemented in Google Reader but that goes against my other use cases, such as being able to get instantaneous search results simple search being done on the client side over all the records we got in the JSON array and multiple filters.p  pOne thing I have noticed is that both FF and Chrome do not render anything until they loop over all items in the JSON array, even though I explicitly insert the newly created elements into DOM after every loop as soon as I have the HTML. What Id like to achieve would be just that force the browser to render as soon as it can.p  pI tried deferring the calls every item from the array would be processed by a deferred function but ran into additional issues there as it seems that the order of execution isnt guaranteed anymore some items further down the array would be processed before other items before it.p  pIm looking for any hints and tips here. p

Negative 54681 pThe end goal for this post is to override the ToString method of a concrete implementation of a generic base class while still being able to search the implementation using Linq flattening technique. So if you read this and see a better way let me know.

Negative 54681 pstrongThe Scenariostrongbr I have a mobile phone comparing asp.net website which displays deals of various networks. The data about the deals we receive from the networks is in an excel sheet. We import the data from the excel sheets to the tables of each network in our database.

Negative 54681 pI took a look into the iso images ISO 9660 of small Linux distributions. I found 16 empty sectors, followed by a sector describing the Primary Volume Description. Next sector is commonly a Boot Record containing only descriptive information such as System and Version Identifier and a little endian integer inside the unspecified byterange. Then comes the Supplementary Volume Descriptor and finally the Volume Descriptor Set Terminator.p  pI only guess its a little endian integer in the Boot Record. I found no more Information about this. In all the images I used was the little endian integer smaller than the value for Sector Count from the Primary Volume Descriptor, so I further guess its pointing to a sector inside the Image. Could someone provide more detailed informations about thisp

Negative 54681 pIve set up a REST service and client in PHP and Im having a bit of trouble with PUT. p  pHeres my situation Im coding a REST resource that should accept an array of data and an image. The REST resource should update an existing record, so Im using PUT. Im sending the data with a PHP curl client I wrote. So  pretty much the same situation as if you were sending a HTML multipart form to a PHP script that does a file upload and accepts some additional POST fields  except with PUT and PHP curl..p  pUp till now Ive been sending the PUT request something like this pseudo codep  precodeasomedata  arrayname gt test, userid gt 4 body  httpbuildqueryadata  fh  fopenphpmemory, rw fwritebody rewindfh  ch  curlinit curlsetoptarraych, array   CURLOPTURL gt httpmyapiresourcesomeid,   CURLOPTPUT gt TRUE,   CURLOPTINFILE gt fh,   CURLOPTINFILESIZE gt strlenbody    curlexecch codepre  pand reading the data on the server like sop  precodeparsestrfilegetcontentsphpinput, putdata codepre  p..which works just fine.p  pSo now I would like to add a binary file into the mix.  How would I implement this on the client side  How would I deal with the file on the serverp  pFor a test I set up a HTML form with a file input, copied the raw multipartformdata request it sends, and tried sending that data as a file with curl in a PUT request. That kind of works, but I would have to parse the raw data on the server manually, which Im not sure is the best idea. Alternatively, I guess I could send the file as the body of the PUT request, and add the other parameters in the URL as a query string  but I guess that kind of defies the point of a PUT REST resource..p  pPlease share your thoughts on this.

I was wondering, how would I be able to check if the HttpWebRequest has finished downloading the files and initiate a ProgressBar until it was finished downloading Do you maybe suggest a different approach to the problemp  pEDIT  Additional info The reason why I would need to have a progress bar is because the data is needed in order for the user to advance. If the user would try to advance in the application and he was on a bad wireless connection and the data was still downloading, the method would of course return null. Thus the progress bar would lock the user out of the app until it finished downloading.p

Negative 54681 pSorry if this is extremely obvious, but I have looked and looked for a solution but havent found anything. Im very new to jQuery, so even looking for what I want to do has been hard.p  pI have a page with a bunch of fields and drop down boxes that are populated from a database. So each drop down has the correct item the one stored in the database selected when the page loads. When that option is Other I want my Other text box to show up. p  pSo, the question is how do I showhide that text box based on the selected drop down item when the page loads Everything I have been able to find in my research has been related to the drop down menu changing. This works fine for one of the other pages I have. I dont want to have to reselect Other triggering the change event.p  pThanksp
Negative 54681 pI was thinking of using the Visual C Windows Forms designer to design the UI leaving me to focus on the program functions and logic. I used to make the UI By hand earlier. So does using the Designer instead of coding the UI By hand cause any extra overhead Also will this make my code incompatible with MONOp  pOVERHEAD Any extra memory , extra startup time, decrease in efficiency and performance.p

Negative 54681 pI have a WCF service in Azure. I can reference its IP address and successfully hit it with a browser or with WcfTestclient.exe. Ive gone into GoDaddy and mapped svc.mydomain.com to my IPport and now I cant hit with a browser, but not with WcfTestClient.exe. The error is Error Cannot obtain Metadata from a hrefhttpsvc.mydomain.comService1.svcwsdl relnofollowhttpsvc.mydomain.comService1.svcwsdla... Metadata contains a reference that cannot be resolved httpsvc.mydomain.comService1.svcwsdl.    The remote server returned an unexpected response 408 Request.

Negative 54681 pI would like to establish what is the order of the taskbar items in Windows 7. The reason is that I would like to create an script written in AutoHotkey or C that restore a set of icons to a previous determined order. I want to do this because any Virtual Desktop solutions for Windows forget the great and important point of keeping the taskbar items order, i.e between desktop changes the order of the taskbar items are completely ignored and lost. The reason of why they ignore that fact is maybe because all of them rely in the HIDEUNHIDE approach, they save what windows are active in any desktop and then between switches they Hide or UnHide the corresponding windows.p  pI already found a semi solution writted in QTC a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5931566locationofapponthewindows7taskbarLocation of app on the Windows 7 Taskbara that base his function in find the leftupper pixel position of an item based in his color. I dont like that approach because the use of different themes or visual styles would break his functioning. I hope someone has another suggestion. This question differs from that in the link that Im only interested in the order not in the exact pixel position of any button.p

Negative 54681 pI have a class which reads data from port through TcpClient. Ive created 2 threads. p  ol liPacket Reading Threadli liPacket Processing Threadli ol  p1 Thread continuously reads bytes and once it gets a proper packet it adds that packet in a Queue and initiates the 2nd thread, which then reads packet from that Queue and processes it.p  pThe packet processing should be done sequentially. Therefore each time when the reading thread adds the packet in Queue, it checks that whether that Processing Thread is running or NOT. If NOT then it again starts that thread. This is because we dont want multiple packet processing threads running simultaneously.p  pNow my question is actually related to that checking part. What Ive done is that, Ive added a simple bool variable in my class. And when I strongget into the packet processing threadstrong I set that bool  true. While packet reading thread checks this bool variable, if it is true then it knows that the processing thread is running. And when packet processing thread reaches strongat end, it sets that bool  false.strongp  pIs this the correct way Or is this approach prone to race conditionp  pThanks.p  pstrongUpdate a little detailstrongp  precodedelegate void PacketProcessDelegate PacketProcessDelegate PacketProcess  new PacketProcessDelegatethis.PacketProcessingThread  PacketReadingThread      Packet  GetPacket   thread blocks until packet is NOT received     Queue.Synchronizedthis.Queue.EnquePacket     if this.IsProcessing         this.PacketProcess.BeginInvokenull, null   PacketProcessingThread      this.IsProcessingtrue     whiletrue          Queue syncQueue         syncQueueu  Queue.Synchronizedthis.Queue         ifsyncQueueu.Count gt 0             packet extraction and processing code here         else             break          this.IsProcessingfalse  codepre  pstrongGoalsstrongbr Packet Processing thread eitherbr  should be terminated and should be restarted, but ThreadPool should be utilized in order to prevent creation of a new thread each time.

I need to consolidate the spreadsheet by concatenating all the descriptions into a single record where there are multiple occurrences of the UniqueID value. Generically, I want to loop through the range of potential values and say if UniqueID is equal, then take all of the Description values and concatenate them together in a single row either the first row or a new row then delete all the old rows. Basically, I want to create the ConsolidatedText field in this sample data, and then also delete the extra rows.

Once the Selenium tests are executed, the execution of annotated methods will be recorded.p  pstrongProblemstrong The big obstacle of this project is finding a way to relate an execution of a test case with the traversal of a method, especially that the tests and the application run on different JVMs, and theres no way to transmit the name of the test case down the application,  and no way in using thread information to relate test with code execution.p  pstrongProposed solutionstrong My solution would consist of using the time of execution I extend the JUnit framework to record the time the test case was executed, and I instrument the application so that it saves the time the method was traversed. And I try to use correlation to link the test case with method coverage.p  pstrongExpected problemsstrong This solution assumes that test cases are executed sequentially, and a test case ends befores the next one starts. Is this assumption reasonable with JUnitp  pstrongQuestionstrong Simply, can I have your input on the proposed solution, and perhaps suggestions on how to improve and make it more robust and functional on most Java EE applications Or leads to already implemented solutionsp  pThank youp  pstrongEditstrong To add more requirements, the tool should be able to work on any Java EE application and require the least amount of configuration or change in the application. While I know it isnt a realistic requirement, the tool should at least not require any huge modification of the application itself, like adding classes or lines of code.p

Negative 54681 pI do not have the link anymore as it was a few months back, but there was a great and detailed article about setting the charset of the body being sent to the useragent.p  pThe gist of the article was that when possible, send it via the contenttype header since the useragents parser will know before the body begins being parsed that it is for example utf8, etc.p  pSending it via meta tag means it has to wait for said meta tag to be found, then return to the top of document and begin reparsing the document again.p  pSo for quite a while now, we have been sending the charset via contenttype header, like so in PHP anywaysp  precodeheaderContenttype texthtml charsetutf8 codepre  pAll works great. As far as we can see everything is as should be in all the commonly used useragents.p  pMy question is this, as a backup  failsafe  just in case, should we still send the charset meta tag Will sending it again using the meta tag defeat the purpose of sending it via the contenttype headerp  hr  pstrongeditstrong This is not the exact article, but reiterates the point  a hrefhttpcode.google.comspeedpagespeeddocsrendering.htmlSpecifyCharsetEarly relnofollowhttpcode.google.comspeedpagespeeddocsrendering.htmlSpecifyCharsetEarlya  that when possible, send charset via header.p

Negative 54681 pConsider this simple python code, which demonstrates a very simple version control design for a dictonaryp  precodedef buildcurrenthistory     current       for action, key, value in history         assert action in set, del         if action  set             current[key]  value         elif action  del             del current[key]     return current  history  [] history.appendset, 1, one history.appendset, 2, two history.appendset, 3, three print buildcurrenthistory history.appenddel, 2, None history.appendset, 1, uno history.appendset, 4, four print buildcurrenthistory for action, key, value in history     if key  2         print s, s, s  action, key, value codepre  pNotice that by using the history list you can reconstruct the current dictionary in any state it once existed. I consider this a forward build for lack of a better term because to build the current dictionary one must start at the beginning and process the entire history list. I consider this the most obvious and straight forward approach.p  pAs Ive heard, early version control systems used this forward build process, but they were not optimal because most users care more about recent versions of a build. Also, users dont want to download the entire history when they only care about seeing the latest build.p  pMy question then is, what other approaches exist for storing histories in a version control system Perhaps a backwards build could be used That might allow users to only download recent revisions without needing the entire history. Ive also a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiComparisonofrevisioncontrolsoftwareseena a few different formats for storing the history, namely changesets, snapshots, and patches.  What are the differences between changesets, snapshots and patchesp  pOf the modern popular version controls available, how do they store their histories and what are the advantages of their various designsp
Negative 54681 pI am trying to take an XML file containing multiple orders from an online shopping cart, parse it and output the values of each order as its own text file not XML using C and Visual Studio 2008.

Negative 54681 pWe have complex template classes that have some methods which will not work with certain policies or types. Therefore, when we detect those types at compile time, using typetraits we fire a static assertion with a nice message.p  pNow we do a lot of manual template instantiation as well. Partly it is so that the methods are forced to compiler to syntax check the methods. It also reduces compile time for the library user. The problem is that the static assertions are always fired and consequently we cannot manually instantiate the template class in question.p  pIs there a workaround for thisp  pstrongEDITstrong To make it clearer, here is an example the explicit instantiation in this case will fail on someFunc1p  precode header template lttypename Tgt class someClass    void someFunc    void someFunc1  staticassertfalse, assertionfailed     source template someClassltintgt  Explicit instantiation codepre  pstrongEDIT2strong Here is another example.

Negative 54681 pI have a part of my mvc 3 web app, where I need to allow users admins in this case to manage users.

I am trying to wrap my brain around several FoxPro 9 programs that were written by a nonprogrammer and, having never looked at FoxPro code before in my life, am finding it quite a chore to understand some of its idiosyncrasies. p  pI have a pretty simple SQL statement that is returning information from the Project filebeing used as a table.

The ShortName function returns just the file name, the LongName function returns the entire path and file name and the GetType function is supposed to return a more human readable string that tells me what the file type is. Such as Table, Program, etc . . .p  pstrongHERE IS THE PROBLEMstrongp  pThe GetType function is being run and the return value is being set but the value being returned is being truncated to 6 characters. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comkGpwy.png altenter image description herep  pI have verified that the return value of the function is the full string of text that I expect just before the function exits.

Negative 54681 pIm working on an ASP.NET MVC3 site that, as a platform, works great on its own  but it is meant to be brandedbrandable for 3rd parties.  p  pFor the 3rd parties, it is important I keep brandrelated assets and code isolated in source control, so that they dont interfere with the the assets of other brands, or of the main platform code.  And just as important, I need to have unit tests that prove the branded versions of the site are returning the appropriately branded views, etc.p  pAt face value, it seems I need to have a Visual Studio solution file to contain the projects of the ASP.NET MVC main site platform.  I then need to have a separate VS solution for each brand to contain satellite assemblies, custom views, etc.  The VS solution for each brand would contain a unit testing project that tests branding outcomes.p  pHowever, I dont want the branded VS solution files to hold references to the projects of the main platform site VS project files should belong to exactly one VS solution.  This implies that the branded ASP.NET MVC project files must have a binary dependency on the buildoutput of the main VS solution.  Perhaps I enlist an inhouse Nuget server to aid with this.p  pCan anyone share guidance on the overall solutionprojectfolder structure of the branded projectsassets, so that the main MVC site can be integrated as merely a Nuget package  In short, the branded materials would have a dependency on the main platorm, not the other way around. p  pp.s. If someone has an argument of why all the branded materials, of all 3rd parties, should indeed live in the same solution as the main platform code  Id listen to that too.p

Negative 54681 pI am trying to rewrite my URLs in PHP using the output buffer. Ideally this is so in my source I can keep my links as codeexample.comindex.phpaction123sa456sa2789code but when outputted to the browser it rewrites as codeexample.com123456789code It seems to be working but when it gets to the sa2 rewriting the output buffer tends to break occasionally and all the browser sees is a blank white page. When the page loads it starts an output buffer with gzip and then an output buffer with a rewrite callback. Here is my php.htaccessp  precodeltphp  if obstartobgzhandler     obstart   Handle Rewriting of URLs RewriteURLs  function RewriteURLs   rewrite URLS from output buffer function rewritebuffer       pages     buffer  pregreplaceindex.phppage.is, page1, buffer      subsubactions     buffer  pregreplaceindex.phpaction.sa.sa2.is, 123, buffer      subactions     buffer  pregreplaceindex.phpaction.sa.is, 12, buffer      actions     buffer  pregreplaceindex.phpaction.is, 1, buffer      index.php removal     buffer  pregreplaceindex.phpis, , buffer     return buffer   start for rewriting obstartrewrite    rest of contentpage loading....... gt codepre  p.htaccess to handle the rewritingp  precodeOptions FollowSymLinks   RewriteEngine on   RewriteBase     Rules for pages RewriteRule page[w]  index.phppage1    [L,QSA]   Rules for subsubactions  actionsubactionsubsubaction RewriteRule [w][w][w] index.phpaction1sa2sa23   Rules for subactions  actionsubaction RewriteRule [w][w] index.phpaction1sa2   Rules for actions  action RewriteRule [w]  index.phpaction1    [L,QSA] codepre  pThis looks more and more like a PHP output buffer problem I just cannot seem to find what I am doing wrong.

Negative 54681 pA web app Im working on needs to identify devices as either activated or not activated to prevent them from using services that they havent paid for.  Right now, we store it a webSQL table and if you clear browser settings, you are completely hosed and we have to fix it for you.  p  pIs there a more persistent way to uniquely identify devices to determine their device activation statusp  pIve been looking into evercookie, but it only took a clear and a few force closes of the browser to kill it Android without the force closes, it worked fine even with the browser clear.  Better, but not ideal.  I do not have an iOS device to test it on but all we really care about are those two.p  pAre there better options that I dont know about  Is evercookie a smarter than what Ive currently got or is it unnecessaryp  pJust some background on the business model we are using.  Clients buy device licenses, one device license activate one device as in one device can now be used, not one account.  So multiple devices can be on one account but they need to be activated.  So unique accounts are out.  We NEED a way to force device activation with a web app.p

Negative 54681 pWe are writing an inventory system and I have some questions about sqlalchemy postgresql and transactionssessions. This is a web app using TG2, not sure this matters but to much info is never a bad. p  ol lipHow can make sure that when changing inventory qtys that i dont run into race conditions. If i understand it correctly if user on is going to decrement inventory on an item to say 0 and user two is also trying to decrement the inventory to 0 then if user 1s session hasnt been committed yet then user two starting inventory number is going to be the same as user one resulting in a race condition when both commit, one overwriting the other instead of having a compound effect.pli lipIf i wanted to use postgresql sequence for things like orderinvoice numbers how can I getset next values from sqlalchemy without running into race conditionspli ol  pEDIT I think i found the solution i need to use withlockmode, using for update or for share.

Negative 54681 pi am going to provide a webservice to customers. Idea is to provide a common platform for a number of customers. Customers have to register in my site by filling some details and i will issue them GREEN signal for using this service. And i will give them a vb.net and android application that uses this webservice and also a sample php application to use it in their website if needed.p  pEach customer is considered as an organization. So they can add employees, check employee details, company details, add products, etc. These db operations are done using my webservice. I have read w3schools tutorial about webservices. I didnot understood SOAP architecture clearly. But i know about JSON. And in PHP echoing json output is easy because we need to call jsonencode passing array.p  pBut i donot know how to do authentication. I mean login to webservice application from client application with userame and password. Will storing value in SESSION works, like a normal php application  For client, will it save session in cookie  What is easiest architecture to use JSON Is it possible Please share any reference links that you bookmarked, if you were doing something like this.p  pI donot want to use a complex way. Please help me.I appreciate your response.p

Negative 54681 pI got several XML elements referring to eachother using a parent subelement. Not all toplevel elements need copying, so I have a fixed list of mainsection uniqueNames which do need to be copied.p  pList of mainsections of which subsections should be copied in my XSLp  precodeltxslvariable namemainSectionsgtnewssportltxslvariablegt codepre  pSource XML Main sectionsp  precodeltsection uniqueNamenewsgt ltsectiongt  ltsection uniqueNamesportgt ltsectiongt  ltsection uniqueNametravelgt ltsectiongt codepre  pSource XML Sub sectionsp  precodeltsection uniqueNamenationalnewsgt   ltparent uniqueNamenewsgt ltsectiongt  ltsection uniqueNameregionalnewsgt   ltparent uniqueNamenationalnewsgt ltsectiongt  ltsection uniqueNamecitynewsgt   ltparent uniqueNameregionalnewsgt ltsectiongt  ltsection uniqueNametraveleuropegt   ltparent uniqueNametravelgt ltsectiongt  ltsection uniqueNamehollandgt   ltparent uniqueNametraveleuropegt ltsectiongt codepre  pEtc.p  pBecause the subsections are prone to moving, changing or deletion between developmentphase and production of my XSL, I need to determine dynamically if any given subsection is a child of one of the main sections. There are also countless subsections in total. Hardcoding a list of subsections to copy is undoable.p  pSubsection depth can be really deep, as shown in the example Section citynews has regionalnews as parent, which has nationalnews as parent which has news as parent, so this section needs copying, because it is eventually a child of news. The toplevel section Travel for section holland under subsection traveleurope is not on the list to be copied, so it needs to be ignored.p  pAt first I tried checking each  element if the parent is in the list, but that was just stupid, it only gets me 1 level deep. My last attempt was to create a javascript first indexing all sections, then analyzing the structure eliminating all sections related to mainsections not on the list. But calling the script proved to be a challenge as well, since XSL has no means of its own to call javascript.p  pI am a bit clueless on how to proceed on this... Any solutions or suggestions  p  pThe source XML document is 3500 lines and the info in there does not matter for this question. The question is how do I filter out subsections of subsections of subsections of a mainsection, or How do I determine if a subsection is a child of on of the specified mainsections a few steps up the tree.  Consider the 5 mentioned subsections to be input, then the  output should be p  precodeltsection uniqueNamenationalnewsgt   ltparent uniqueNamenewsgt ltsectiongt  ltsection uniqueNameregionalnewsgt   ltparent uniqueNamenationalnewsgt ltsectiongt  ltsection uniqueNamecitynewsgt   ltparent uniqueNameregionalnewsgt ltsectiongt codepre  pSince p  precodeltsection uniqueNametraveleuropegt   ltparent uniqueNametravelgt ltsectiongt  ltsection uniqueNamehollandgt   ltparent uniqueNametraveleuropegt ltsectiongt codepre  prelate to the travel mainsection, which is not on the list to be copied.p

Negative 54681 pI am aware that one cannot listen for, detect, and perform some action upon encountering context switches on Windows machines via managed languages such as C, Java, etc. However, I was wondering if there was a way of doing this using assembly or some other language, perhaps C If so, could you provide a small code snippet that gives an idea of how to do this as I am relatively new to kernel programming p  pWhat this code will essentially be designed to do is run in the background on a standard Windows UI and listen for when a particular process is either context switched in or out of the CPU. Upon hearing either of these actions, it will send a signal. To clarify, I am looking to detect only the context switches directly involving a specific process, not any context switches. What I ultimately would like to achieve is to be able to notify another machine via the internet signal whenever a specific process begins making use of the CPU, as well as when it ceases doing so.p  pMy first attempt at doing this involved simply calculating the CPU usage percentage of the specific process, but this ultimately proved to be too coursegrained to catch the most minute calculations. For example, I wrote a test program that simply performed the operation 22 and placed the answer inside of an int. The CPU usage method did not pick up on this. Thus, I am looking for something lower level, hence the origin of this question. If there are potential alternatives, I would be more than happy to field them.p

Also, using an NSListView instead of an NSScrollView is not really an option, for a number of reasons.p
Negative 54681 pSince TypeScript doesnt support minification or obfuscation, both of which are features we need, we still need a tool like Googles Closure compiler in our tool chain. Is there anyway to get TypeScript to output javadoc comments automatically, so that Closure can just become an automated stepp  pWithout it, it looks like these tools are largely incompatible, because we need to have javadoc comments, which means we cant use TypeScript. It seems like it would be an easy feature to add, since you know the types of everything.p  pThanks,p  pJason p
Negative 54681 pI am currently in an introductory c class and am working assignment that sorts data. We recently covered structs and I decided to use structs to approach the problem rather than create 3 arrays to hold the information from our data file.p  pThe trouble im having is when im trying to pass my struct to my function. Here is my errorp  precodeanalyzedata.cpp In function int main analyzedata.cpp76 error conversion from weather to nonscalar type weather requested analyzedata.cpp In function int findposofsmallestweather, int, int analyzedata.cpp110 error no match for operator[] in data[pos] analyzedata.cpp110 error no match for operator[] in data[posofsmallest] codepre  pI dont understand the error from line 76. I have done some research about passing structs to functions, and what i found was adding the amp in the type declarations. However, i have no idea what it does or why i would need to do that as we havent covered it in class. I also did try it, but i just got a different set of errors.

Negative 54681 pAfter some time fiddling today I mocked up a quick modular slider for one of my clients website. I wanted to theme the scrollbars so went ahead and picked up the the jQuery plugin called jScrollPane available here a hrefhttpjscrollpane.kelvinluck.com relnofollowhttpjscrollpane.kelvinluck.coma. This simply did the trick and I was able to style the scrollbar with pictures. The only problem I am stumbling upon is that the scroll bar doesnt drag further than the middle, it does scroll horizontally the modules. Here is a quick jsFiddle to describe on my problem a hrefhttpjsfiddle.net95fG6 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.net95fG6a.

Negative 54681 pI have a FrameLayout as the content of a sliding drawer that im replacing with fragments.  When my activity starts the FrameLayout is replaced by a GridView Fragment. When i click on an item in the GridView it replaces the FrameLayout with a TextView fragment. This new fragment has a button that goes back and replaces the FrameLayout again with a GridView Fragment.  This all works fine but for some reason neither the GridView nor the TextView refreshes when changed to, but after i click on a button that gets info from a server which ever one is visible at the time refreshes with the new information.  Is there a way to make android think i need to redraw the GridView and TextView  Ive tried invalidate about everywhere on everything and it doesnt seem to work in the slightest. It seems like android is calling the getView method on the GridView Adapter and then it refreshes but that is never called when the fragment changes to the gridview.p  pSorry for the confusing question and explanation, i dont really know what code to post since there is so much.

Negative 54681 pI would just like to ask how to best represent in database schema the forms with radial button YN that if yes, would have an input field.

Currently I have this very simple schemap  precodetblUser  userid  tblAnswers  answerid userid questionid answer   tblquestions  questionid questiontext codepre  pI think the schema I have right now is fine for most things multiple checkboxes as an answer, radial buttons, etc. But for radial buttons with dependent input field, Im not sure. I would like to have it straightforward and simple by the way...I only have 1 survey per 1 user. And the questions wont change for a long long time perhaps even never. Then again, maybe my current schema would work for radial with input dependency...instead of Yes as an answer, Ill have the input field value instead So in codetblanswercode I could have an codeanswercode like codeStress pillscode instead of Yes or codeNocode. Would that be acceptable Or is that a bad idea Any help would be greatly appreciated.p
Negative 54681 pThis is probably somewhat of a niche problem, but perhaps someone can help me.  Im porting my web services from ASMX to WCF, however Im totally built on Castle ActiveRecord.  To make sure I dont have some sort of weird issue in my configuration, Ive built an isolated repro from scratch using all the latest Castle and NHibernate libraries from NuGet.p  pThe first thing I do is initialize ActiveRecord in codeApplicationStartcode.

However, Id like to not have to do this in all my code, as this works perfectly in an ASP.NET Web Service.p  pstrongSo why does it work in ASP.NETstrongp  pThe reason is works is because ActiveRecord comes with an httpModule called codeCastle.ActiveRecord.Framework.SessionScopeWebModulecode.

Negative 54681 pThe shop I work for is using jenkins for continuous integration and its promoted builds plugin to deploy build artifacts.  However, were having trouble managing this set up as the number of configurations grows.  So my question isp  pstrongHow can I set up a handy CI system from which I can deploy various artifacts in various configurations without manually scripting every possible combinationstrongp  pSome more detailsp  pLets say I have build configurations i.e. branches codeAcode, codeBcode and codeCcode.  There are three deployment  targets codeIcode, codeJcode and codeKcode say for various clients or consumers.  Finally, each deployed instance has various services codeXcode, codeYcode and codeZcode  e.g. website, background tasks and dataservice.  The various services are usually promoted together but sometimes, particularly to get hotfixes out, theyre not.p  pCurrently, we have promotions for each of these combinations.  So to install a typical build Id need to run promotions codeJXcode, codeJYcode and codeJZcode on config codeCcode.  The number of services is unfortunately rising, and getting all those configurations in jenkins without making any error, and furthermore ensure that none of the components are forgotten or mixed up when deployment comes around is getting tricky.  And of course, there are more than three build configs and more than three targets, so its all getting out of hand.p  pSome options that dont quite workp  ul lipParametrized promotions to disable various components.  Jenkins allows parametrized promotions, but the values are fixed the first time you promote.

Negative 54681 pDoes anybody know a way to disable or in some way modify the open functionality in elFinderp  pIm using this in an ASP.NET MVC site and have added additional serverside filtering for file permissions and whatnot.

Hence, server responds with 405. Subsequently, when user clicks, again same HTTP GET without id results in HTTP 405. I am not able to somehow feed id to the GET URL. I have checked JSON, it is in perfect shape, as it works in standalone table, that is declaratively defined.p  pPlease suggest me ways to link a TREE node through its id to Gridx.

Negative 54681 pFor one of our Insights platform, we plan to generate summary SQLite3 databases in the background and let it be rendered on the browser as charts. Currently, we are intending to a serverside endpoint that will service the data requirement. p  pWe are looking to optimize this further by eliminating the serverside endpoint altogether. We are fine from a security perspective to expose the SQLite3 directly on S3 and have a javascript module read and generate the charts. p  pThe SQLite3 files are expected to fairly small  perhaps 46 columns and perhaps 10500 rows of data, and all of them containing one table only. Test runs indicate file sizes of less than 15KB. We dont intend to write or manipulate the SQLite3 on the browser.  We dont need to cache it on the browser as a WebSQL or an IndexedDB form, but we are ok with using them if that is what is needed.p  pFrom my web searches, We are unable to find a Javascript library that can read a SQLite3 file and query it for results. If you know of any javascript libraries that can do this, then please let us know.p  pOn the other hand, if you think that we shouldnt be doing this for whatever reason, then please throw them as commentsanswers too, because this is something we are trying for the first time and seems a little outofthebox, so feedback welcomep

Negative 54681 h1Problemh1  pI intend to write a C11 application for Linux which does some numerical simulation not cryptography based on approximately one million pseudorandom 32bit numbers. To speed things up, Id like to perform the simulation in parallel threads using all cores of a desktop CPU. Id like to use the Mersenne Twister a hrefhttpwww.boost.orgdoclibs1530dochtmlboostrandommt19937.htmlcodemt19937codea provided by boost as the PRNG, and I guess that for performance reasons I should have one such PRNG per thread. Now Im unsure about how to seed them in order to avoid generating the same subsequence of random numbers in multiple threads.p  h1Alternativesh1  pHere are the alternatives that I have thought of so farp  ol lipSeed the PRNG for every thread independently from codedevurandomcode.p  pIm a bit worried about the case when the system entropy pool gets exhausted, as I dont know how the system internal PRNG operates. Could it happen that I accidentially get consecutive seeds which exactly identify consecutive states of the Mersenne Twister, due to the fact that codedevurandomcode is using a Mersenne Twister itself Probably strongly related to my concerns for the next point.pli lipSeed one PRNG from codedevurandomcode and the others from that first one.p  pBasically the same concern as well is it good or bad to use one PRNG to seed another that uses the same algorithm Or in other words, does reading 625 32bit integers from a codemt19937code correspond directly to the internal state of the codemt19937code generator at any point during this generationpli lipSeed others from first with nonMersenne information.p  pAs using the same algorithm to generate random numbers and to generate the initial seed feels somehow like it might be a bad idea, I thought about introducing some element which is not dependent on the Mersenne Twister algorithm. For example, I could XOR the thread id into each element of the initial seed vector. Does that make things any betterpli lipShare one PRNG among threads.p  pThis would make sure that there is only one sequence, with all the known and desirable properties of the Mersenne Twister. But the locking overhead required to control access to that generator does worry me somewhat. As I have found no evidence to the contrary, I assume that I as the library user would be responsible for preventing concurrent access to the PRNG.pli lipPregenerate all random numbers.p  pThis would have one thread generate all the required 1M random numbers up front, to be used by the different threads later on. The memory requirement of 4M would be small compared to that of the overall application. What worries me most in this approach is that the generation of random numbers itself is not concurrent. This whole approach also doesnt scale too well.pli ol  h1Questionsh1  pWhich of these approaches would you suggest, and why Or do you have a different suggestionp  pDo you know which of my concerns are justified and which are simply due to my lack of insight into how things actually workp
Negative 54681 pI have a css that makes a button rotates and increases size. I want to know whether , only through CSS and HTML5, can i make that property run once the page is loaded completely or being loaded.p  pExample I have a rating list of 10 things which are displayed in a table with one entry in each row. In front of each row is a number that displays the current position in the ranking of that particular item.p  pNow what i want to achieve is as the images and links are loaded of the list, the 10 buttons rotate and expand.p  pAlso if this cant be achieve not only via CSS and HTML5, is there a way that Javascript can deal with it A small example if possible would be much appreciated p

Negative 54681 pSo I am using  document.forms[0].onsubmit in my code to check if two duplicate values exist in the text field on my applications , if a user enters two numbers that are the same , then when you click on submit, an alert box pops up telling you that two numbers are the same ..

Negative 54681 pJust as I wrote in the title Right after launching the application if I start a thread which calls a usual method then waits for 10 seconds and this gets repeated till the user quits the app, will it cause any performance issues Or will it have a negative impact on other Threads and AsyncTasks, which might have higher priority Like, lets say I have another thread which is triggered by a button, and it emhasem to be executed instantly even if the main repeating thread is going. Could someone introduce me a safe solution p  pThank you for your answers, I am going to provide you an example I have a button which is expected to be pressed once, so I examine if the user has already pressed it or not every 10 seconds. But beside this ongoing thread the user is able to trigger other short threads like download a 100KB file in the background or load some data from an external database. So as I understand there will be no mess up and I can have that ongoing thread as long as I wish. this is just an example, I intentionally do not use the listener of the buttonp

Negative 54681 pI have jQuery UIs datepicker function running on one of my pages.

It looks like the datepicker function is not available within the scope of my function, even though the jQuerydate object is available.p  pDoes anyone have an explanation or a workaround for thisp  pUPDATE After ragnarok56 posted the jsfiddle demonstrating the code working, I went back to my page to look more carefully at what might be affecting it. This is part of a larger system that administrators can customize by adding their own header and footer code, and it turns out that an administrator had added his own link to an older jQuery script in the footer. I removed that and my code worked as expected. I also replaced my jQuery include with his and my code still worked, so it seems the problem is not the old version of jQuery, but including jQuery twice. It seems strange that this would prevent the jQuery function from working inside a function but not outside a function, so Ill leave this open in case someone can provide an explanation of that behavior.p

Negative 54681 pEssentially, Im simulating objectoriented programming in basic C, due to necessity. For my own convenience, Id like to use a macro or an inline function to reduce the amount of code I need to write. For my 400 variables, each needs a structure likep  precodeint x int getx     return x  void setxint a     x  a  codepre  pI was hoping there was some intelligent way to write this as a macro oneliner, so that I can feed type codefooxcode and itll replace it with all that code. The difficulty, I think, is in using the variable codexcode  as a string, so that it can be used in function titles.p  pIs there some C guru out there whos come across this sort of thing beforep

Negative 54681 pI am looking for a jQuery plugin or pure JavaScript solution which allows for drag amp drop sorting of nested lists. I have come across several examples of this but I need one which will allow particular restrictions.p  pThe restrictions I need are that toplevel items can be reordered but cannot be moved to a sublevel. Also sublevel items cannot be moved into toplevel positions but can be moved between toplevel items as a subitem.p  pI hope that makes sense Ive spent ages searching for a plugin to do this but to no avail. There are some good nested sorting options available but none which will do this.

Negative 54681 pI was wondering what the disadvantages are to having many tables lets say 100,000 rather than one large table.

Negative 54681 pMy Java Program is below. Its my training exercise. The one implements stack stucture for special type of string parsingstring with delimiter.p  pThis delimitermatching program works by reading characters from the string one at a time and placing opening delimiters when it finds them, on a stack. When it reads a closing delimiter from the input, it pops the opening delimiter from the top of the stack and attempts to match it with the closing delimiter. If theyre not the same type theres an opening brace but a closing parenthesis, for example, an error occurs. Also, if there is no opening delimiter on the stack to match a closing one, or if a delimiter has not been matched, an error occurs.

Negative 54681 pI have a div containing text. The text can vary in length from time to time. If the content is long enough to increase the divs height to more than say, 9em, Id like to set the divs height to 9em. The div will already have overflow hidden applied to it via css. Any help is appreciated. Thanksp

Negative 54681 pI think this will be relatively elementary, but I cannot for the life of me figure it out. p  pImagine a dataset in which there are 108 rows, made up of two readings for 54 clones. Pretty much, I need to condense a dataset based on clone column 2, by averaging the cells from [6653], whilst keeping the information for column 1, 2, 3, 654 which is identical for these columns between the two readings. p  pI have a pretty small dataset, in which I have 108 rows, and 654 columns, which i would like to whittle down to a smaller dataset. Now, the rows consist of 54 different tree clones column 2, each with two readings column 4 54  2  108. I would like to average the two readings for each clone, reducing my dataset to 54 rows. Just FYI, the first 5 columns are characters, the next 648 are numeric. I would like to remove columns 4 and 5 from the new dataset, leaving a dataset of 54x652, but this is optional. p  pI believe that a plyr function or something will do the trick, but i cant make it work. Ive tried a bunch of things, but it just wont play ball.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 54681 pAre there any volume issues regarding the Facebook app secret and how many separate connections or applications I can use the same app idsecret on For example, Im creating a SharePoint autohosted Facebook application. Autohosted means that the server component of my app will be automatically deployed to Azure each SharePoint customer. There is no way that I know of, obviously anything is hackable to a degree that a user will be able to get the app id or secret, so Im not concerned about the security aspect of it, or sharing the secret. However, potentially thousands of individual apps could be using the same app idsecret to connect to Facebook. Is this an issuep  pBy the way, Im not necessarily talking about the bandwidthtraffic threshold, Im more concerned with the number of individual connections using the same idsecret. I realize that the policy states If you exceed, or plan to exceed, any of the following thresholds please contact us as you may be subject to additional terms 5M MAU or 100M API calls per day or 50M impressions per day.

I know that there are lookaheads in regex, but I wonder if what I am trying to achieve is possible at all. Even if it was possible, I also worry about the performance hit of using lookaheads since I dont fully understand how they work internally.p  pIs there a way of doing this with a single regex validation, or do I have to search row by row and then try to see if the Xs are all contiguousp  pEdit As a clarification, I am trying to search for blobs of Xs. As long as there are contiguous Xs across columnsrows it can be considered as belonging to a blob.

Negative 54681 pIm fairly sure that in Lua, you can use a given metatables codeindexcode, codenewindexcode, and codecallcode to roughly replicate Rubys codemethodmissingcode.

Every single variable that you use in the context of the table you apply a codemethodmissingcode to is never nil, since I have to return an object that can be called in order to codepass the buckcode of the potential call from the index function to an actual call. p  pi.e. After defining a global methodmissing as above, attempting to call undefined method testprint runs as expected, but the value of testprint when indexed is nonnil, and other methodsvariables that arent responded to, like codethisshouldbenilcode are nonnil.p  pSo is it possible to avoid this pitfall Or can the syntax not be bent to support this modification without modifying the language source itself I imagine the difficulty arises in how in Ruby, indexing and calling are analogous, whereas in Lua they are distinct.p

Negative 54681 pUntil now we have had a postbuild step that uses the Sass gem on the command line to generate our global.css.p  pIm swapping over to Cassette, which uses Cassette.Sass, which uses SassAndCoffee, which apparently uses Sass 3.2.0 p  pHowever when Cassette does the compiling, I get weird nulls in the generated css. Judging by how the page looks, this is invalid css and screwing up the design.p  pFor egp  precode.purecontainer  padding 31px null padding 1.714rem null paddingright 0.9375  codepre  pI thought it may be down to a version difference of Sass as we were using the sass gem for 3.2.8, but if I use the Sass gem version 3.2.0 from the command line, I get the same valid output as before I started using Cassette, without nullsp  precode.purecontainer  padding 31px padding 1.71429 rem paddingright 0.9375  codepre  pSo to summarize, Cassette.Sass using Sass 3.2.0 is not compiling my CSS in the same way as the Sass 3.2.0 Gem from the command line. What should I checkp  pI am not a frontend dev and not very familiar with scss, but if its relevant, this is what our global.scss looks likep  precode  SCSS Helpers  import importsmixins.scss import importsvariables.scss    Pure Grid  import importsextendpure.scss    Theme  import importstypography.scss import importshelpers.scss import importsbuttons.scss import importsforms.scss import importsmodules.scss     Media Queries  import importsmediaphone.scss import importsmediatabletquery.scss import importsmediadesktopquery.scss codepre  pAnd all those imported files exist and there are no SASS compiling exceptions.p  pThe only mentions of null that I can find is in mixins.scssp  precodemixin sizeproperty null, units 4, importance null, mixin null     This mixin will calculate the rem values defined by design 6pxs in mobile and scaled up for desktop    Because IE8 and below dont support rem, we insert the px equivalent for the desktop sizes just before.   pixelsize round6units1fontsizemobilefontsizedesktop  px importance   remsize 1fontsizemobile6units  rem importance   if mixin  minheight      include minheightpixelsize     include minheightremsize      else if mixin  maxheight      include maxheightpixelsize     include maxheightremsize      else      property pixelsize  This number is rounded to the nearest whole number to avoid issues with IE7     property remsize       EXAMPLE OF HOW TO USE    include sizelineheight, 4, important lt important is optional    EXAMPLE OF HOW TO USE 2    include sizemixin minheight, units 4  codepre  pCassette is otherwise quite awesome and I would love to use it, but this is quite a big barrier Any thoughts appreciated, including where else I could post this in the hopes of an answer that might help I am aware that there are other options for compiling Sass, and if I dont get much joy here Ill dump Cassette in favour of MS.Web.Optimization in combination with NSass, but I really want to get Cassette working if I canp  pThanks, Mark.p

Negative 54681 pOkay, Ive exhausted all links and cant seem to find the answer. p  pI have followed a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comguidetopicsmediacamera.html relnofollowthis guidea to creating a video camera app and I cant seem to get the file to save. p  pIn the tutorial it talks about saving to external memory, the phone I am developing on is a Google Nexus 4 and doesnt have external memory So I am trying to save to internal memory but I have no idea how to do this with video. I also read the a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comguidetopicsdatadatastorage.htmlfilesInternal relnofollowstorage optionsa guide too but again, I am finding this of little use...p  pIdeally, I would like to do this so that the recorded video is displayed in the Gallery so any assistancepointing in the right direction would be great My current saving methods looks like the following which replicates that in the android tutorial. I know its here the code needs to be edited but Im not sure what too.p  precode Create a file Uri for saving an image or video  private static Uri getOutputMediaFileUriint type     return Uri.fromFilegetOutputMediaFiletype    Create a File for saving an image or video  private static File getOutputMediaFileint type  To be safe, you should check that the SDCard is mounted  using Environment.getExternalStorageState before doing this.  File mediaStorageDir  new FileEnvironment.getExternalStoragePublicDirectory           Environment.DIRECTORYPICTURES, MyCameraApp  This location works best if you want the created images to be shared  between applications and persist after your app has been uninstalled.   Create the storage directory if it does not exist if  mediaStorageDir.exists     if  mediaStorageDir.mkdirs         Log.dMyCameraApp, failed to create directory         return null         Create a media file name String timeStamp  new SimpleDateFormatyyyyMMddHHmmss.formatnew Date File mediaFile if type  MEDIATYPEIMAGE     mediaFile  new FilemediaStorageDir.getPath  File.separator      IMG timeStamp  .jpg  else iftype  MEDIATYPEVIDEO      mediaFile  new FilemediaStorageDir.getPath  File.separator      VID timeStamp  .mp4  else      return null   return mediaFile  codepre  pPerhaps Im missing something obvious but Ive spent six hours looking at this now trying different things.

Negative 54681 pIam working on a programm which is used to upload and download files onto a FTP server. When I use it on my computer it works just fine. Connection to FTP, down and uploading works great But a friend of mine wanted to test it on his computer and noticed that the programm always caused a socket write error.

When my friend tried it with his it wont work...p  pHe is also using Kaspersky so I suggested he should shut down kaspersky and his windows firewall. But it still dont work. He still gets the socket write error.p  pIn other tutorials it usually worked when people shut down their windows firewall. Do I have to configure kaspersky as well How would I do thatp  pI think it is just all about port restrictions or something like that... When he uses fileZilla to access the ftp it works just fine.p  pThanks in advance p

Negative 54681 pWe are trying to retrieve a list of all the domain users. Problem is there are over 13000 users in the domain, so we are timing out. On the developers.google.com, they give tips to improve performance a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comadminsdkdirectoryv1guidesperformance relnofollowhttpsdevelopers.google.comadminsdkdirectoryv1guidesperformancea. One tip is to retrieve a partial response using the fields request parameter. But we cannot figure out what the correct fields are for codefullNamecode and codeprimaryEmailcode. We tried using the codesetFieldsfullNamecode method in Java  didnt work. We also tried codenamefullNamecode, codenamesfullNamescode and they didnt work either. Same problem for codeprimaryEmailcode. Keep getting the error message codeInvalid field selection fullNamecodep  pAny idea how to get around thisp

Negative 54681 pI want to create a lookup table for texas holdem poker hands. Right now, I am using prime numbers to represent each card, and want to figure out what those cards represent as a total hand. This is because the order of the cards dont matter and the multiplication will provide us with a unique number. Now, I know about the hand evaluators, but they only evaluate the strength of the hand without draws, and do not separate the hands into as many categories as I need.p  pAs an example take the following situation Hand AdKd Flop Kc5d3dp  pd  diamonds, c  clubs, h  hearts, s  spades Now, this would return from the lookup table a pair and also a flush draw. p  pNow this is more tricky Hand AhAd Flop 5c5h3dp  pThis would evaluate to overpair. So, basically, we cannot combine the hand and the flop into a single number, as we want to know exactly how the hand interacts with the flop.p  pI have already created a way of determining if a flush or a flush draw exists and whether a straight or a straight draw exists. So after that, the suits no longer matter, and we dont care about nonpair hands. Basically, given two numbers that represent the hand and the flop, we get back a hand category. For the last example, Aces are the prime number 41, so for the hand we get 41411681 and for the board, we get 773147. Ok now, we go to our lookup table and enter this lookup147, 1681 and it should return OVERPAIR or whatever constant we set it to, in constant time. p  pHow do I implement first the lookup table And the lookup function Im already planning on using a perfect hashing algorithm for both the flop and the hand, but dont really know how to combine them.p

Im assuming they did this for easy maintenance when it comes to updates but as far as I could tell QtCreator doesnt know how the follow the link since its finding the emliblastfm.soem but cant reach emliblastfm.so.1em.p  pI tried to delete the em.soem and em.so.1em files and then rename the em.so.1.0.8em file into just emliblastfm.soem but it still said that it cant find the em.so.1em file, which was kinda confusing.p  pI also tried addid the library manually by right clicking the project and select Add library but when I reached the liblastfms folder, only the emliblastfm.soem file was recognized as a library file and if I added it, the same error occured.p  pSo, any help would be appreciatedp

Negative 54681 pOk, so fgetc returns an unsigned char cast to int, and EOF at... EOF. What if youre trying to read in a config file to a char array, and your implementations char is signed The standard for C99 says that not only is the result implementationdefined to assign an unrepresentable value to a signed variable, but that the implementation can alternatively choose to raise a signal insteadp  blockquote   p6.3.1.3 Signed and unsigned integersp      pWhen a value with integer type is converted to another integer type other than Bool, if the value can be represented by the new type, it is unchanged.p      pOtherwise, if the new type is unsigned, the value is converted by repeatedly adding or     subtracting one more than the maximum value that can be represented in the new type     until the value is in the range of the new type.49p      pOtherwise, the new type is signed and the value cannot be represented in it either     the result is implementationdefined or an implementationdefined signal is raised. p blockquote  pConstructs like this are very commonp  precodeint c, i  0 char arr[1024]  for  c  getcDescriptor  EOF ampamp i lt sizeof arr  1 i          arr[i]  charc  arr[i]  0 codepre  pIts also implementationdefined to perform the cast if char is signed and the value in c is higher than can be represented.p  pI find it extremely unlikely that I have found a problem that thousands of programmers have missed over the years, especially with the ubiquitousness of the construct above.p  pIt seems that there is a possibility that nontext code read through this means could cause issues, since some of the bytes could have values that dont fit in a signed char. Ive never seen a modified version of the above construct that actually addresses this put to use.p  pHave I actually found a flaw relating to the C standard, or noticed something thousands of other programmers have not and failed to implement in their error checkingp

Negative 54681 pI could not find topic like this and that is why I am posting this question. I have a side scrolling game with the character set up in positions with frame labels animation states to stand, jump, run, kneel and fire. She is also made to fire bullets with separate class file. The problem is that right now she is firing bullets in all of the animation states. The question is how do I make this character fire the bullets only on the frame label fire. The frame label fire consists of 2 frames and I want the launching of the bullet to happen on the second frame. Which means that the keyboard space will be pressed for a second or two before it goes to this frame and then it will fire like in real life.  I tried to connect the animation state to the bullets somehow and tried to put the condition in these lines of code somehow p  precodeife.keyCode  Keyboard.SPACE if Animation state Fire 2 fireBullet  codepre  pBut it did not work, it doesnt know what I am talking about. The class file for the bullet is separate and I dont think is relevant to the problem.  The rest of the timeline code is like thisp  precodevar bulletListArray  new Array  ife.keyCode  Keyboard.SPACE  fireBullet    function fireBulletvoid  var playerDirectionString ifplayer.scaleX lt 0 playerDirection  left  else ifplayer.scaleX gt 0 playerDirection  right  var bulletBullet  new Bulletplayer.x  scrollX, player.y  scrollY,  playerDirection xSpeed back.addChildbullet codepre  pThank you.

The reason is, probably, because the old .pem file is valid but the new .pem file is not.p  pI strongly desire to have an error response from the APNS server if the .pem file is invalid, but it seems that the APNS server or apnsclient library isnt returning any error signals even if .pem file is invalid. Ive proved this fact by adding one hundred codeacodes to the line before before codeEND RSA PRIVATE KEYcode in .pem, and running the same python script. Yes, it still didnt receive any error messages.p  pSince APNS server is returning no error messages, its nearly impossible to check if the .pem file is valid...

However, if the mouse hovers in the data area of the GridView, the header stays frozen.  When I hover the mouse over the header then scroll up and down the header stays in place.  When I move the mouse off of the Frozen Header after the up and down scrolling the header either re appears at the top of the page or disappears altogether.  In the scenario of the header disappearing completely, hovering the mouse over the Edit link brings the header back into place.p  pScenario 2  Mouse Hovers Over Frozen Header While Scrolling  As one of the things I tried, I thought to switch the editing links to buttons to see if that would solve the issue.  Scrolling the GridView with the mouse hovered over the Edit buttons have no effect on the header at all.  The header stays in place and works as described.  Scrolling with the mouse hovered in the data area and the Frozen Header in the paneled GridView stays frozen.  However, when I hover the mouse over the header then scroll up and down the header stays in place.

Events range from oneday classics to threeweek grand tours. Some of the more famous races are the oneday classics of ParisRoubaix in northern France, Tour de Flanders in the Belgian heartland, MilanSan Remo along western coast of Italy, and the grand tours of France, Italy, and Spain. Many people who are not cycling fans will have heard of the Tour de France, one of the largest sporting spectacles on earth.  ltbrgt  ltbrgt  Professional cycling is governed by the Union Cyclist Internationale lta hrefhttpwww.uci.chgtUCIltagt based in Aigle, Switzerland.    ltarticlegt   ltarticlegt  ltheadergt     lth3gtThe Top Raceslth3gt  ltheadergt   ltimg alt Stage 10  Tour de France 2013 srcimagesimage1.jpg width75 height100 gtArguably the biggest race of the year is the Tour de France which is held during July. Some riders specialize their riding style to do well in the grand tours, while other riders will specialize in the oneday classics and shorter stage races. The Tour de France typically has between 20 and 22 stages, usually one stage each day. The winner is determined by the lowest overall cumulative time over all stages. Stages include special stages run individually against the clock called time trials, but most stages are massedstart events with all riders covering the same course together. The Tour de France allows teams of 9 riders and typically between 18 and 22 teams are invited to compete in the event.   ltarticlegt    ltarticlegt ltheadergt     lth3gtThe Top Riderslth3gt  ltheadergt    ltimg alt Philippe Gilbert former world champion srcimagesimage2.jpg width75 height100 gtRiders acquire UCI points throughout the year based upon their finishing position in the various races held around the world. The leader on points in any World Tour event wears a special jersey that signifies their leadership position. However, each year, the UCI also hosts the world championship event where the world champion is determined based on the winner of a single day event. For professional riders this event is normally around 150165 miles long. This past year, Rui Costa of Portugal won the event to be crowned the 2013 World Champion. He will wear a special rainbow jersey until the world championship event next year, where he will attempt to defend his title.   ltbrgt  ltbrgt  Other top riders in 2013 were Fabian Cancellara of Switzerland, Tom Boonen of Belgium, and Chris Froome of Great Britan.    ltarticlegt   ltdivgt    ltdiv idsidebar rolecomplementarygt   ltasidegt  ltarticlegt  ltheadergt     lth3gtBikes of the professionalslth3gt  ltheadergt  Professional riders use specific bikes for specific events.

Negative 54681 pI have a slight problem in trying to make my website responsive as well as laying out images nicely with packery.p  precodeltdiv idcontentgt  lt width of this determined through javascript     ltdiv classimagecontainergt         ltimg srcpicture width500 height700gt     ltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pcssp  precode.imagecontainer    maxwidth100  img     width100  codepre  pIve set the codemaxwidthcode at code100code for my codeimagecontainercodes so that theyre never larger than the main codecontentcode div. With the above code, however, the images inside get squashed horizontally as the codeimgcodes codewidthcode, but not codeheightcode is overruled by the codeimagecontainercodes codemaxwidthcode. The simple solution to this problem is of course to remove the codeheightcode value from the codeimgcode, but Ive just painstakingly ADDED it so that a hrefhttppackery.metafizzy.co relnofollowpackerya wont make a mockery of my layout when its loading by placing posts on top of each other. Adding codeheightautocode to the img css also ruins the layout when its loading, just to be clear.p  pThe best solution Ive come up with is to remove the codeheightcode attribute from the image once its loaded, but I was wondering if theres maybe an easier cssonly solution, or a smarter way of doing it with jsp

Suppose the virtual function run is a lot of code, all of which is essentially the same. The only difference in the parent and child classes is what values I want specified in the vector bar, so it would seem to be a little wasteful to redefine the virtual function in the child class. However, if you redefine Childbar, and call Childrun, the Parentbar is used since its defined in the parent class. Is there some way to have the line vector Parentbar  Parentfoo know in the Child class to use Childfoop

Negative 54681 pI need to work with a REST service build with an JAXRS implementation in an heterogeneous environment, so I wondered how the abstractions of programming languages are converted to the real restful endpoints. I think most aspects are clear, but when it comes to asynchronous communications in REST I know several possibilities keeping the connection open, returning a resource that can constantly be queried, chunked messages or the client transmits a callback resource.p  pMy approach was to read the a hrefhttpdownload.oracle.comotnpubjcpjaxrs20frspecjsr339jaxrs2.0finalspec.pdf relnofollowJAXRS 2.0 Specificationa, but I think there is actually little stated about the REST implementation of asynchronous requests. Then I read the a hrefhttpsjersey.java.netdocumentationlatestasync.html relnofollowJersey documentationa and came to the conclusion that the JAXRS implementations just keep the connection open for as long as the processing needs. So with asynchronous JAXRS just refers to the blocking of methods on the serverclient side and does not use any special behavior of REST. My first question Is my analysis correctp  pIf this is the case, I have two new questionsp  ul liIs this really compliant to the REST paradigm in respect to the stateless constraintli liConsidering the longrunning processes that maybe work for days, is an open connection eventually automatically closed e.g. by the OS or by a TCP timerli ul  pThanks in advance p

Thus, I could simulate that Im streaming to port 2222. My code is something like this p  precode  Please note that this is the simplified code  cause it worked   ive just post the key lines Winsock1.Bind 1111 Winsock2.remotePort  2222  WinSock1.GetData myPacket Winsock2.SendData myPacket codepre  pThen I tried playing the stream from port 2222 using ffplayp  precodeffplay udplocalhost2222 codepre  pWell, I dont know why the video quality turned to this badp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comqCZY5.jpg altenter image description herep  pThe point is that, Ive sent the same UDP packets in the same order as the streamingsource. What could be wrong herep  hr  pPS Ive tried a similar experiment like above with TCP, but the endresult video quality was as good as direct streaming. So, could this be a problem of UDP p  hr  pPS2  Ive tested the UDP packet loss amp disorder by replacing the ffplay with a socket that listen to port 2222 amp print out all the received packets. But the result is all 10,000 packets were in correct order amp nothing lost. What a crazy phenomenonp

Negative 54681 pMy iOS app authenticates a user with a login screen upon initial entry into the app and after login success the credentials are stored in keychain. Unless the user goes and logs out of the app, the rest of the times the user opens the app they are authenticated against stored credentials. p  pWhen the user logs out the app is reset to its initial ViewController and the keychain and any stored data is wiped out. There is a sequence that will make NSURLConnection use the TLS session cache and not call codecanAuthenticateAgainstProtectionSpacecode and that is if a user logs in from the main login screen not from stored creds then without closing the app goes and logs out and tries to login again. p  pWhat I have trieddone so farp  ol liI have used this a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosqaqa1727index.html relnofollowhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosqaqa1727index.htmla to solve part of the problem.  I should note that I do not have control over the server so I can not adjust ports or set up the server to route wild card domain names. li liI have implemented the . at the end of the host name for the login screen authentication call and no . on the host name for the stored credentials authentication call.  li liI also tested to see if the server was setup to route wildcard domain names by appending a random number to the beginning of the host name and that did not work.  li ol  pI am looking for a solution other than the . at the end of the host name to trigger codecanAuthenticateAgainstProtectionSpacecode delegate method every time that API call is made. p

The Loyal Customer criteria are as followsp  ul liThe Customer must have been invoiced at least 4 times within 36 months, with invoices falling in the following time ranges  ul liFirst Invoice A  This does not necessarily have to be the first time the customer is ever invoiced, just the first invoice that falls into this patternli liSecond Invoice B  Has to occur from 112 months after Invoice Ali liThird Invoice C  Has to occur from 1324 months after Invoice A li liFourth Invoice D  Has to occur from 2536 months after Invoice Ali ulli liOnce these criteria are met, all invoices with a    date greater than or equal to A are considered loyal customer    invoices  ul liOnly invoices with positive sub totals should be counted    as qualifying invoices A, B, C, or D, but all invoices should be    counted once the customer meets the qualifying criteriali ulli ul  pSo far, Im OK with this.

Negative 54681 pIve searched for anything similar to what Im experiencing for a couple of days now with no luck.  I recently upgraded a suite of Web Forms Applications from .NET 3.5 to .NET 4.5.1.  After cleaning up a few referencing issues surrounding NuGet packages, I managed to get everything building and running locally IIS8 much easier than I expected. p  pHowever, once I uploaded everything to the production server IIS 7.5, Windows Server 2008 R2, I noticed that postbacks, whether they be triggered from a LinkButton or an autopostback on a DropDownList, only work intermittently.  The first load of the page, everything works fine.  Go to the page again a minute later, click the same button, and the postback happens but the event handler isnt reached.  The event handlers are attached either via the OnClick or OnChange properties or the Handles Clause in codebehind.p  pOne thing that I find curious is that when the postback happens on a link button click event and the event handler isnt reached, the form is reset.  Does that suggest a ViewState related issuep  pAgain, everything worked fine when the application was targeting .NET 3.5, and even now that its targeting 4.5.1 everything works fine when debugging on my local machine with IIS8, but running in IIS7.5, postbacks are a huge problem.p  pAny ideas, suggestions would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 54681 pfirst I would like to let you know that I am not very experienced with C, and not experienced at all with SDL. Although I have studied documentation and examples for SDL I cant understand what I do wrong . Here is my casep  pstrongemDescription of Situationemstrong I have a written an application in VS Express 2013  using C that reads a custom bitmap file and does various things with it. Actually this custom bitmap contains many frames , so it is more like a custom animation file. In my main program, after loading the file I have a List of pixels, for each frame.  Since I need to preview the frames loaded I have a Picture Box on the application window. Until now I used the Drawing methods of C to update the preview Picture Box. I simply created a Rectangle for each pixel , filled it with the color it should show, and all worked. Since these animations started getting bigger, with many pixels and frames, this procedure is very heavy and slow. I decided to use SDLDotNet to make things better. I hope I made the right decision, since I am not an expert with graphics. For now I have two possible solutions  One is to ..somehow, not sure how... make SDl draw on the original preview picturebox of my application. Second is to let SDL create its own window and use that for preview. p  pstrongemDescription of Problememstrong I created a class in my project for all the SDL functionality. I use the following code to draw the preview windowp  pcodepublic void InitSdl                      Video.SetVideoMode800, 640, false, false, false, true             Surface sfc  Video.CreateRgbSurface200, 300             vidSfc Video.SetVideoMode200, 300, 32, false, true, false, true, false             background  new Surface200, 300, 32.ConvertvidSfc,true,false             Events.Quit  new EventHandlerltQuitEventArgsgtApplicationQuitEventHandler             Events.Tick  new EventHandlerltTickEventArgsgtApplicationTickEventHandler             Events.Runbr         codep  pwhere vidSfc is a surface in the same class and so is background. The aim is to fill backround with a backcolor, say black, then use primitive methodsor another way that I am still investigating to draw the pixels in the background surface and the ask SDL to draw the background inside the vidSfc. It seems to me from all the tutorials and examples, that it is always good to have a master surface for the final screen output, and other surfaces to do the processing and preparation of frames.p  pOnce the code above runs, I get a separate window which is drawn gray. I cant draw anything in this window, at least with all the ways I have tried. Here is some code that I used trying to redraw bacgkroundp  precodepublic void FillSfcSystem.Drawing.Color c              background.Fillc         background.Update         vidSfc.Blitbackground         vidSfc.Update      codepre  pNothing happens when I run this ... Regarding the Events.Tick and Events.Run , that are commented out, here is my excuse First, I dont need events at the moment other than Quit, which seems to work fine, with some calls I do on application Close. Second, when code hits codeEvents.Runcode it never comes out, so it never returns control to my main application that called the codeInitSdlcode. I assume this is because all of the examples and tutorials I studied refer to applications where SDL is the main program and controls everything, so I havent found some documentation or example to see how could SDL be used as a slave to draw under the control of my application, like System.Drawing in C does.p  pAny input on this will be appreciated, and remember I am new to all this, maybe some questions seem silly, but I am stuck.p  pThank youp  pAlexp

Negative 54681 pHow can I find the source branch commit for a feature branch after the branch has been mergedp  pConsider a git workflow with a master branch and release branches. Master continues forward to the next release. Bug fixes are applied to the release branch, but must be back ported to the master branch.p  pThe feature branch is created on the release branch, reviewed, and merged into the release branch. The feature branch must now be rebased to the master branch to apply the fix to master as well. However,p  precodegit rebase onto master release codepre  pResults in 0 commits. This makes sense as release has moved forward and p  precodegit mergebase HEAD release  codepre  presults in HEAD mergebase being used internally to determine the rebase starting point.

I did do coderunparts vcode to check if it worked alright, and it does, cuz it did execute properly and opened up the website after running that, but the problem is Cron isnt running it like when I tested it with coderunparts vcode for some reason. Its like its being ignored, there doesnt seem to be a permission issue, because if it did it would of shown up in the logs like emGoogle Chrome can not run as Rootem since thats my default browser to run as.p  pI dont believe there is anything wrong with my script since codexdgopen httpexample.comcode runs as expected from the script when tested, and in my crontab when I do codecrontab ecode I have it set like thisp  precode0 0 5 11     etccron.dailyexamplecom codepre  pbut still doesnt execute as it should be.

Negative 54681 pIm seeing odd behavior when having my codeDataGrids selectedItemcode and and my codeListBox SelectedItemcode both bound to the same property.p  pmy backing collection is a codeDataTablecode. I have a codeDataGridcode with the codeItemSourcecode bound to the codeDataTablecode. I also have an codeListViewcode with its codeItemSourcecode bound to the same codeDataTablecode. One view is a grid display of the data, and the other is basically a time line showing the same data visually. Im drawing the items on a canvas which is the codeItemsTemplatecode for the codeListViewItemscode. I then have a codeSelectedItemcode property in my view model that is bound to both collections codeSelectedItemcode. All this is working fine, i select one in the codeListBoxcode it gets selected in the codeDataGridcode and vise versa. I then  have a codepopupcode on each codeListViewItemcode whose codeisOpencode property is bound to the codeisSelectedcode property of the codeListboxItemcode so if you click on an item in the codelistboxcode the popup shows you some info on the item. p  pThe problem is, when  i click an item in the codeDataGridcode I can see the corresponding item in the codeListViewcode is being selected however the popup is not appearing. The weird thing is that if i arrow up or down in the codeDataGridcode the popups do appear, or if i click and drag my mouse selecting rows up and down in the codeDataGridcode the popups also appear. However, if i click a single row in the codeDataGridcode the popup does not appear, even though I can see visually the item in the codeListBoxcode did get selected. I think clicking the cell is somehow eating the selected item or something but im not sure. Kinda stumped on this one.

Negative 54681 pI would like to know if this is the proper way for stopping my periodically called codeservicecode or not. I have a static boolean variable codeisServiceStoppedcode in my codeMainActivitycode where I can start or stop the ongoing codeservicecode by clicking on a button. As you see I reschedule my service in the codeonDestroycode method with codeAlarmManagercode, so if I called codestopServicecode in my MainActvity it would just destroy the service but reschedule it again so there would not be any effect.  This is why I am using a flag, a static boolean variable that I can set in my MainActivity if I click the button to stop the service I set this flag codetruecode and the service will not be rescheduled again as it will not run in the codeonDestroycode method.p  pThis is working, but I personally believe that this is just a bad workaround since if I close the app how would the system find the static variable if only the service is running So what is the proper way doing this Should I put the reschedule part in the codeonStartCommandcodep  pThanksp  precodepublic class AsyService extends Service           Override         public IBinder onBindIntent i                     return null                   Override         public void onCreate              super.onCreate                                  Override         public void onStartIntent intent, int startId                 super.onStartintent, startId                        Override         public int onStartCommandIntent intent, int flags, int startId              Toast.makeTextthis, service starting, Toast.LENGTHSHORT.show             return STARTNOTSTICKY                     Override         public void onDestroy                Right now I have a static variable defined in MainActivity to set the boolean isServiceStopped              if MainActivity.isServiceStopped                 AlarmManager alarm  AlarmManagergetSystemServiceALARMSERVICE                 alarm.set                     AlarmManager.RTCWAKEUP,                     System.currentTimeMillis  1000  15,                     PendingIntent.getServicethis, 0, new Intentthis, AsyService.class, 0                                               codepre  pstrongMainAcvitiystrongp  precodebtn2.setOnClickListenernew View.OnClickListener           Override         public void onClickView v               PendingIntent pendingIntent  PendingIntent.getBroadcastMainActivity.this, 1, new IntentMainActivity.this, AsyService.class, PendingIntent.FLAGUPDATECURRENT             AlarmManager alarm  AlarmManagergetSystemServiceALARMSERVICE             alarm.cancelpendingIntent                codepre

Negative 54681 pI would like to build an infinite picker using Qt. It should be infinite like the iOS timepicker, however I would like it horizontally using approx 1000, variable width and fixed height elements. p  pI have a few ideas, ways how I can solve the problem, but I am not an experience Qt developer so I dont know which one is the right way concerning the stability, changeability, performance, etc.p  pPlease advice me if you think I could use an other approach or in case you have experience with one of the way I solve the problem.p  ol liTricking the userli ol  pI would use the idea from qt a hrefhttpqtproject.orgdocqt5qtwebkitexampleswebkitwidgetsscrollerwheelexample.html relnofollowwheel scroller examplea .p  pI consider using a simple QWidget. I could easily grab the gestures by using the codeQScrollergrabGesturecode. p  pI would set the QScrollPrepareEvent viewport size to the widget size and the content position range to a huge value codesetContentPosRangeQRectF.0, .0, kWidthInfiniteScroll, .0code p  pAfter that I plan to move my drawn elements to their proper place and draw the elements which are not drawn. I would like to draw only those elements that the user can see, because I dont want to use much memory. maybe a few more because of caching an user experiencep  pDisadvantages  I tried to think deep in this solution making some sketch and I figured out that it will be really hard following which element should I draw in next steps because they dont have a fixed width.  Also I consider this a bit low level approach because I have to move and reorganize the screen for every scroll event, I could get also performance issues because of that.p  ol start2 licodeQScrollAreacode and codeQWidgetcodeli ol  pI would use the codeQScrollercode with the same configuration as above however and a huge codeQWidgetcodein example 80.000px wide, the value that I used in codeQScrollercode. I would scroll the QWidget using codeQScrollArea ensureVisiblecode function when I get a scroll event from codeQScrollercode.p  pI could easily figure out which element should be drawn from the QWidgetrepaint event rectangle. I draw or remove elements after I detected repaint based on the rectangle to be updated. p  pExample When I get a scroll event I call codeQScrollAreaensureVisiblecode with the proper parameters, this cause an QWidgetrepaint from where I know that I need to draw a new element and remove the ones which are no more visible.p  pDisadvantages p  pSetting an 80.000 pixel width QWidget to QScrollArea looks a pretty big hacking and performance problem for me. I tried it, it slow like Windows 95.p  ol start3 licodeQGraphicsViewcode and codeQGraphicsScenecodeli ol  pI would do the same as the previous approaches the only difference that I would use the codeupdateconst QRectFamp rectcode function of the QGraphicsScene and the codecenterOnx,ycode function of the codeQGraphicsViewcode.p  pSo when the user scroll I call codeQGraphicsViewcenterOncode, this fires an codeQGraphicsSceneupdateconst QRectFamp rectcode and I could add the missing element to the slider and  easily remove the elements which are not visible any more.the same as abovep  pThis should eliminate the performance problem, however I have the same performance issue as in approach 2strangep  pThis approach sounds the most reasonable and simplest, but I got slow scrolling even if I use a 3000x1000 size QGraphicsScene, strange.  p  pPlease share your experience with me, what do you think, which is the most reasonable. I think there is one good approach for that not 3, which way should I takep  pThanks for your time that you spent answering my questionp

Negative 54681 pIn both perl and python, you have to print some headers if you want and a new line before the page content. Otherwise you get an error  strongcodeEnd of script output before headerscodestrong.p  pIn php things are different. Whenever you print something using either codeprint code or codeecho code, it is assumed as a plain text, even if you try to print a header. To do this print a header, you should use the codeheadercode function which is not available in perl and python.br Some examplesp  precodeltphp  this is a plain text in the page, you can use echo  to get the same result print Contenttype textplain charsetutf8nn codepre  hr  precodeusrbinperl   this is a header with two new lines after it without them you get the error print Contenttype textplain charsetutf8nn  the same is in python codepre  hr  precodeltphp print Some text, no headers are sent, no new lines are printed and you get no errors codepre  hr  precodeusrbinperl print Some text, no headers are sent, no new lines are printed and you get an error.  the same is in python codepre  pYou have to place a new line before text in perl in python but not in php.

Negative 54681 pBefore I delve into the code, what Im looking for is the number of times to do Tab key to check off a check box on a web form because not all will have all four example categories below. Time is an issue, and I do not want to create 4 columns, one for each category and count each gap as a Tab, but condensed like the excel sheet below. There are 99 unique checkboxes to go thorugh, and usually no more than 10 will be checkboxd off. To tab through every single 99 values will take forever based on the If... Then... statement. I know what arrays are to an extent but perhaps not when math is involved how do I perform the math to deduct the number of times to codeCall Tabcode Heres what Im attempting to dop  pThe Excel sheet is set up like thisp  precode                       A            B              C          D                   1    Adult        Mom           Child        Dad                   2    Adult        Mom           Dad                   3    Mom         Child         codepre  pTo check off an ordered checkboxes on a web form, the  is a check markp  pEntry Row 1p  p Adultbr  Mombr  Childbr  Dad  p  pEntry Row 2  p  p Adultbr  Mombr  Childbr  Dad  p  pEntry Row 3p  pAdultbr  Mombr  Childbr   Dad  p  pI want to be able to find out the number it takes to the next item to check off. For example, from Adult to Dad is 3 items down the list, but from Child to Dad is 1 down. From Adult to Child is 2 down the list. The goal is to have VBA look at the String in ActiveCell, whether it is Adult or Mom, and then perform the math of how far down the list the next item is. It will be done in a loop with the For Loop If Then. The web forms check box list will never change.p  pThere is a long list, 99 unique items. The math Im thinking of is taking the position number it previously checked off last, say, it checked off Child, which is position 3, and then the next string value has a value of Dad, which is a 4. Subtract the number, it becomes 1.p  pI found a tutorial online, but it doesnt really tell me how to do math a hrefhttpwww.homeandlearn.orgarraysandloops.html relnofollowhttpwww.homeandlearn.orgarraysandloops.htmlap  precode   Sub ArrayCat     Dim ArrayActiveCell as string    Dim Adult as string    Dim Mom as string    Dim Child as string    Dim Dad as string    Dim n as Integer    Dim next as String    Dim previous as String    Dim I as Integer    ArrayAdult  1   ArrayMom  2   ArrayChild  3   ArrayDad  4     ..

I make liberal use ofp  precodeApplication.SendKeysdos something, True codepre  pAnd I build several different Subs doing different things, such as copying and pasting, tab from field to field, open drop down menus and select a value by using SendKeys, etc. The main purpose of the macro is to act as a person who is doing shortcuts CTRLC, V ALTDown key ALTTab, and so on. I turned all of these into SendKeys. Heres the main Sub calling different actionsp  precode    Sub repeating  Submit several entries worth of data into web form     Call ccnyc5     Call beep       Call lockit     End Sub      Sub ccnycnumCalls As Integer            Dim I As Integer            If Not numCalls gt 0 Then Exit Sub            For I  1 To numCalls     Call getExcel     Call hide     Call replacing take out punctuations     Call copying copies and paste the name of Agency I found on the internet and put into Excel to be put into database via macro     Call wait1     Call aCopyingTwo1 phone Note to StackOverflow, this means skipping a field box which is attachment button. I simply tab twice to go into Phone field box     Call aCopying7  aCopying involves If... Then, seeing if theres anything to copy, and if there is, paste it, Else, it tabs to the next box.

Currently, some involve If... Then, but it can only do one value per category Audience, Type of Organization, and type of Services. Reality is that organizations serve more than one population, more than one type of Org, and have multiple services. Its going to involve math to find out how many empty checkboxes to Tab skip through to the next one. Doing the same thing as aCopying would take more than 20 minutes per form, which is not acceptable. Im trying to find the best solution to this problem. Ill show some of the checkbox code Im using after this sub ends.p  precode      Call bkTab  For some reason, when the County cbeck box is checked, there are 3000 to go through counties, the highlight exits the checkbox after being checked. So, as a result, I use the shortcut Back Tab ShiftTab to complete the rest of the form, which is rather nice because it means not having to tab the entire 3000 counties       Call wait1       Call bkTab       Call backtabs6        Call EndNavei  selecting a drop down value and enter any comments about the Org      Call submit  save form        Next     End Sub codepre  pSome of the check box codesp  precode    The sub to call all Subs to perform check boxes      Sub checkbox     Call aud  Audience check box     Call threeBoxes old fashion tab and check off values       Call getExcel       Call tabnLeft12     Call findCnty  Find out the county it serves and tabcheck      End Sub codepre  pThe code below contains code code which allows me to manually uncomment any category that applies to that org. I tend to find a bunch of orgs that have exactly the same audience, type of org, and services they provide. The easiest is LowIncome Families, Business, and Housing, respectively. That way I dont go back in and commentuncomment every entry. Ideally, and this is what I am looking to do, is to type the type of audience, org type, and services in the excel sheet, evaluate with IfThen or other means of coding, and that way I do not have to uncommentcomment anything, and other people in my department can freely begin to use Excel to put all their findings. The web form is extremely unuser friendly due to the check boxes alone. They cant type the categories, theres nothing they can do except to scroll or tab through the list themselves.p  precode     findCnty code below is also exactly the same for Sub aud as well       Sub findCnty     Dim cnty As String     cnty  ActiveCell      If cnty  Bronx Then     Call getIE          Call tabbs205   Bronx County      Call waitCheck      Call wait25       ElseIf cnty  Richmond Then     Call getIE         Call tabbs1380  Richmond County          Call waitCheck         Call wait90           Call wait10     End if     End sub       After the county is checked, it loses focuses around the check box       and goes to the beginning of the web page. I use the Call bkTab to      finish out the web form and submit      Sub threeBoxes       This is the old way I did things, with the        Call tabs   Advocacy        call waitcheck       Call tabs   Business  Forprofit Organization      Call waitCheck        Call tabs   Communitybased  Nonprofit Service Organization        call waitCheck     .. other Org Types       End Sub codepre  pPlease let me know if you need me to clarify on any points I made with this code.p

Negative 54681 pI have problem with displaying address in text field in one of the apex pages region. Currently I have longitude and latitude text fields, which read their values from draggable marker from the google map. When you drag the marker, the program automatically retrieve geocode and it assigns it directly to appropriate text fields, it works perfectly fine. Now I want to do the same for address, when I drag the marker into any position I want to receive the closes matching address, which will go to the text field. The problem is that I do not know how to format and set right function to display this marker in the text field, all I have now is that when I type the address to the text field and I drag the marker the address is being automatically formatted but it is not updating its current position. The way I used to get the geocode into the text fields is by using procedure in the database, which is later called by apex page using PLSQL and JavaScript.

Negative 54681 pI have a crosscompiled Linux kernel, and it works fine on my Raspberry Pi 2. However, when I later compile modules on Raspberry Pi itself, error is reported.p  pAfter googling, the reason of this problem seems due to the crosscompiling which makes some tools located in codelinuxscriptscode are not suitable for arm architecture but X86. p  pI am not sure that whether it is necessary to compile modules on PC if the kernel is crosscompiled. If not, how could I transfer these tools to Pip

Negative 54681 pI have been doing research on here and have been searching for a solution to the problem. I am new to java so I dont know all of the syntax. I am trying to get my code to transfer items from create methods for the save and load menu items.  The save event handler should call a method save and save the list of parts in the right panel to an XML file.  The load event handler should call a method load and it should display the unmarshalled data in the right panel. I am not familiar with JAXB or XML whatsoever.  I have tried to see if anyone else has done something similar but I cannot complete the code. Can anyone help me out please Below is the entire code.

Negative 54681 pSo Im doing an Android game for an assignment resit. This is not my first app but it is my first game. Ive never been that much of an expert and quite frankly this is hard for me. I hope someone here can help.p  pI actually have two problems to add a score I sincerely hope its not too much. The thing is, I want to display it in a TextView. When the Sprite bad is hit, I want the score to increase by 1.p  pMy first problem is that said TextView doesnt appear on my activity even when Im not putting anything else than text in it. I tried to put it in LinearLayout, or change some parameters for its position, but I didnt find any other helpful thing on internet.p  pMy second problem is for the score, which even if I cant see it, probably doesnt work. I found some helps saying to put a JPanel or JLabel but I dont think this is what I need. I tried a simple thing where I just made it an int that increases in the isHit and then displays it on the page.

Negative 54681 pUnder Windows 7 x64p  pI originally tried to use BIMP to apply a cutout effect to a folder but FUcutout is one of the few that doesnt appear in the plugins list. I read somewhere that was because I hadnt install GIMP while customizing to allow compatibility with older plugin and I dereinstalled to try and fix this to no avail. So I decided to use scriptfu instead but find myself unable to make it work out through the command line.p  pI have checked on a few sites explaining how to batch script including the official GIMP doc and ended with the follow code.p  precodedefine hmdbatchstylize pattern colours smoothness    let  filelist cadr fileglob pattern 1                   while not null filelist          let filename car filelist                 image car gimpfileload RUNNONINTERACTIVE                                           filename filename                 drawable car gimpimagegetactivelayer image                             gimpbrightnesscontrast drawable 35 40             FUcutout RUNNONINTERACTIVE                                image drawable colours smoothness TRUE             gimpfilesave RUNNONINTERACTIVE                          image drawable filename filename             gimpimagedelete image                   set filelist cdr filelist      codepre  pI also register the script but for the sake of simplicity I wont add this code here. Then I open the command line and writep  precodegimp i b hmdbatchstylize CUsersUserDesktop3jpg 32 1 b gimpquit 0 codepre  pin the gimp directory I tried the directory where my files are but gimp isnt recognized as a command there. The gimp console starts up, fails to execute a bunch of dlls and a folder all part of GMIC with the mention Exec format error, then I get two Batch command completed successfully at which point the command line freezes until I close it.p  pI searched online for days hoping to find a solution but no one seems to have the same problem as I do so no solution has worked yet. Help would be greatly appreciated.p  pPS I thought of instead creating a script that would appear in BIMP and act as a middleman to access the FUcutout but I cant find how to pass the current imagefilename being used by BIMP as an argument. If anyone knows how, I feel that might be my simplest way of working around this problem.p

Negative 54681 pI have an API code, which loads a data necessary for my application. Its as simple asp  precode void getDataForKeyNSString key onSuccessid completionBlock codepre  pI cache data returned from server, so next calls of that functions should not do network request, until there is some data missing for given key, then I need to load it again from server side.p  pEverything was okey as long as I had one request per screen, but right now I have a case where I need to do that for every cell on one screen.
