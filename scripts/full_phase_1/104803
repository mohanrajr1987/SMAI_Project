Positive 104803 pMy goal in this was to create an iOS framework that incorporates both Swift and ObjectiveC that I could use in my development projects. The nature of this framework is that the framework itself is undergoing development.

I wanted this to be a framework because I have a few using apps across which I want to use the same framework code.

Negative 104803 pIt is a quite common situation in our applications that some entity have to be represented by an enum for example types, categories, status, and things like that. p  pOften, there are conditions or flows in the code that use the values to decide between one action or another, so the values have to be known in some way for the application i.e. it has to be able to refer to a specific instance to decide instead of referencing the class in a whole. That is why we use enums instead of just a regular class.p  pThe problem is that these entities also need to be stored or at least referenced in the database, as fields of other entities. We usually create a table for each entity, to be capable of having referencial integrity checks in these columns, and also that the data have a meaning in the database alone without the need to refer to the enum to find out what each id means.p  pIdeally, the data for these entities should be populated from the data in the enum, but nowadays we have the values duplicated in the db initialization scripts.p  pIt becomes a bit more complicated when an ORM like Hibernate is used.p  pId like to know how other people handles this kind of situation. p  pIm not fully comfortable with the idea of having a duplication between an enum and a database table, but I havent found a better solution yet. p

As far the customer concerned its a prototype development.p  pThe problem is documentation. We dont have any time estimated and scheduled to prepare the architecture design and detailed design. However Ive created an architecture for the system and created a simple document explaining the architecture and core components etc. as it necessary to shared between the team members and the newbies coming to the project. All other implementation details are reside within the code. For example, were using lot of image processing algorithms, which are not officially prepared as a document.

Negative 104803 pI have a problem with some numpy stuff. I need a numpy array to behave in an unusual manner by returning a slice as a view of the data I have sliced, not a copy. So heres an example of what I want to dop  pSay we have a simple array like thisp  precodea  array[1, 0, 0, 0] codepre  pI would like to update consecutive entries in the array moving left to right with the previous entry from the array, using syntax like thisp  precodea[1]  a[03] codepre  pThis would get the following resultp  precodea  array[1, 1, 1, 1] codepre  pOr something like thisp  precodea[1]  2a[3]  a  [1,2,4,8] codepre  pTo illustrate further I want the following kind of behaviourp  precodefor i in rangelena     if i  0 or i1  lena continue     a[i1]  a[i] codepre  pExcept I want the speed of numpy.p  pThe default behavior of numpy is to take a copy of the slice, so what I actually get is thisp  precodea  array[1, 1, 0, 0] codepre  pI already have this array as a subclass of the ndarray, so I can make further changes to it if need be, I just need the slice on the right hand side to be continually updated as it updates the slice on the left hand side. p  pAm I dreaming or is this magic possiblep  pUpdate This is all because I am trying to use GaussSeidel iteration to solve a linear algebra problem, more or less. It is a special case involving harmonic functions, I was trying to avoid going into this because its really not necessary and likely to confuse things further, but here goes.p  pThe algorithm is thisp  precodewhile not converged     for i in rangelenu[,0]         for j in rangelenu[0,]              skip over boundary entries, i,j  0 or lenu             u[i,j]  0.25u[i1,j]  u[i1,j]  u[i, j1]  u[i,j1] codepre  pRight But you can do this two ways, Jacobi involves updating each element with its neighbours without considering updates you have already made until the while loop cycles, to do it in loops you would copy the array then update one array from the copied array. However GaussSeidel uses information you have already updated for each of the i1 and j1 entries, thus no need for a copy, the loop should essentially know since the array has been reevaluated after each single element update. That is to say, every time we call up an entry like u[i1,j] or u[i,j1] the information calculated in the previous loop will be there.p  pI want to replace this slow and ugly nested loop situation with one nice clean line of code using numpy slicingp  precodeu[11,11]  0.25u[2,11]  u[2,11]  u[11,2]  u[11,2] codepre  pBut the result is Jacobi iteration because when you take a slice u[,2,11] you copy the data, thus the slice is not aware of any updates made. Now numpy still loops right Its not parallel its just a faster way to loop that looks like a parallel operation in python. I want to exploit this behaviour by sort of hacking numpy to return a pointer instead of a copy when I take a slice. Right Then every time numpy loops, that slice will update or really just replicate whatever happened in the update. To do this I need slices on both sides of the array to be pointers.p  pAnyway if there is some really really clever person out there that awesome, but Ive pretty much resigned myself to believing the only answer is to loop in C.p

Negative 104803 pGreetings,p  pIve been writing some nasty code to support the undoredo of deletion of an arbitrary set of objects from my model. I feel like Im going about this correctly, as all the other mutators addingcopypasting are subsets of this functionality.p  pThe code is nastier than it needs to me, mostly because the only way to mutate the model involves calling beginInsertRowsbeginRemoveRows and removing the rows in a range just doing 1 row at a time, no need to optimize neighbors into a single call yetp  pThe problem with beginInsertRowsbeginRemoveRows is that removal of a row could affect another QModelIndex say, one cached in a list. For instancep  precodeParentObj    gtChildObj1    gtChildObj2    gtChildObj3 codepre  pSay I select ChildObj1 and ChildObj3 and delete them, if I remove ChildObj1 first Ive changed ChildObj3s QModelIndex row is now different. Similar issues occur if I delete a parent object but Ive fixed this by pruning children from the list of objects.p  pHere are the ways Ive thought of working around this interface limitation, but I thought Id ask for a better one before forging aheadp  ol lipMove backwards, assuming a provided list of QModelIndices is orderered from top to bottom just go from bottom up. This really requires sorting to be reliable, and the sort would probably be something naive and slow maybe theres a smart way of sorting a collection of QModelIndexes Or does QItemSelectionModel provide good ordered listspli lipUpdate other QModelIndeces each time an object is removedadded cant think of a nonnaive solution, search the list, get new QModelIndeces where neededpli lipSince updating the actual data is easy, just update the data and rebuild the model. This seems grotesque, and I can imagine it getting quite slow with large sets of data.pli ol  pThose are the ideas Ive got currently. Im working on option 1 right now.p  pRegards, Dan Op

Negative 104803 pWe have a PHP app with a dynamic URL scheme which requires characters to be percentencoded, even a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiPercentencodingoldid0Percentencodingunreservedcharacters relnofollowunreserved charactersa like parentheses or aphostrophes which arent actually required to be encoded. URLs which the app deems to be encoded the wrong way are canonicalized and then redirected to the right encoding.p  pBut Google and other user agents will canonicalize percentencodingdecoding differently, meaning when Googlebot requests the page it will ask for the wrong URL, and when it gets back a redirect to the right URL, Googlebot will refuse to follow the redirect and will refuse to index the page. p  pYes, this is a bug on our end. The HTTP specs require that servers treat percentencoded and nonpercentencoded unreserved characters identically.  But fixing the problem in the app code is nonstraightforward right now, so I was hoping to avoid a code change by using an Apache rewrite rule which would ensure that URLs are encoded properly from the pointofview of the app, meaning that apopstrophes, parentheses, etc. are all percentencoded and that spaces are encoded as codecode and not code20code.p  pHeres one example, where I want to rewrite the first and end up with the second form   p  ul liwww.splunkbase.comappsAll4.xAddOnappOPSECLEAforCheckPointLinuxli liwww.splunkbase.comappsAll4.xAddOnappOPSECLEAforCheckPoint28Linux29li ul  pHeres another p  ul liwww.splunkbase.comappsAll4.xappBenfordsLawFraudDetectionAddonli liwww.splunkbase.comappsAll4.xappBenford27sLawFraudDetectionAddonli ul  pHeres another p  ul liwww.splunkbase.comappsAll4.xappBenford27s20Law20Fraud20Detection20Addonli liwww.splunkbase.comappsAll4.xappBenford27sLawFraudDetectionAddonli ul  pIf the app sees only the second form of these URLs, then it wont send any redirects and Google will be able to index the page. p  pIm a newbie with rewrite rules, and it was clear from my read of the a hrefhttphttpd.apache.orgdocs2.2modmodrewrite.html relnofollowmodrewrite documentationa that modrewrite does some automatic encodingdecoding which may help or hurt what I want to do, although not sure. p  pAny advice for rewrite rules to handle the above cases Im OK with a rule for each special character since theres not many of them, but a single rule if possible would be ideal. p

Negative 104803 pwe recently had our SVN repository disappear from the server hosting it.  We still havent figured out how it happened, but we had a semirecent backup which we were able to use to recover the repository.  We didnt lose any work everyone had back ups of their most recent changes on their hard drives but the revision numbers essentially reverted back to older revisions when we started using the old backup of the repository.p  pThe SVN server appears to be corrected now, but Ive noticed some issues with tortoiseSVN which I believe were caused by the changes to the SVN server.  On my local machine I was unable to see any revision that occurred after we reverted to the backup SVN.  I was able to fix this by deleting tortoiseSVN and reinstalling the newer version.p  pNow my colleague is trying to update his SVN trunk and is seeing extremely old versions of files much older then the backup was.  The svn server has the correct files and others are able to access it, so this appears to be an issue with his client.  He has tried deleting tortoise and reinstalling it but this didnt help.  I suspect that tortoise is somehow storingdetecting incorrect information about the SVN server despite the reinstall but I dont know how this is possible.  Does anyone know how we can force his client to check the SVN server and detect the changes that have occurredp

Negative 104803 pI am developing a Darwinian evolution simulation. For performance reasons, its written in C. The sim is represented by an instance of World. The animals are represented by instances of Animal, a fairly complicated object. World has two important methods  p  precodeanimalatint i  codepre  pand  p  precodeevolveint n.  codepre  panimalat returns a nonnull raw pointer to the instance of Animal that represents the ith animal.br evolve advances the simulation possibly stronginvalidating any pointer returned by animalatstrong. I want to make the sim and the animals easily accessible from outside. I have pythonspecific bindings, but im considering learning CORBA or Ice to implement a more generic interface. The problem is how I should expose the animals. I have two ideas, none of which feels satisfactory 1 Rewrite the code slightly to use sharedptr instead of a raw ptr and use a middleware that understands sharedptr semantics. 2 Generate a deep lazy proxy that has the same structure as Animal. Its members would be proxies to members of Animal, recursively. animalat would be actually called in the last moment before referring to the actual data  the pointer would be used and immediately tossed away. This would implement the last moment semantics.p  pI dislike 1 because I would have to introduce a zombie state of the object, which looks inelegant to me. I dislike 2 because the sole purpose of the proxy is to implement the last moment semantics.p  pI am looking for an automatic nonintrusive way using codegeneration to achieve this, because I dont want to obscure the meaning of the original code. Is there any official name for what I call last moment semanticsp

From this point of view, I think the misuse of embandwidthem in digital world is acceptable.p

I have a fairly simple socket routine which works fine in WinXP 32bit, but the socket.connect call is throwing the exception No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it 127.0.0.148000p  pIve added an exception to the win7 firewall for the program, and doubled checked to make sure the rule it added was allowing all ports.p  pThe code I use to setup these simple sockets is as followsp  pstrongListening Socketstrongp  precodebyte[] bytes  new Byte[8192] IPHostEntry ipHostInfo  Dns.GetHostEntrylocalhost IPAddress ipAddress  ipHostInfo.AddressList[0] IPEndPoint localEndPoint  new IPEndPointipAddress, 48000  ListenerSocket  new SocketAddressFamily.InterNetwork, SocketType.Stream, ProtocolType.Tcp  try      ListenerSocket.BindlocalEndPoint     ListenerSocket.Listen1000      while Running              ListenerSync.Reset         ListenerSocket.BeginAcceptnew AsyncCallbackAcceptCallback, ListenerSocket         ListenerSync.WaitOne           ListenerSocket.ShutdownSocketShutdown.Both     ListenerSocket.Close  codepre  pstrongConnecting Socketstrongp  precodeIPAddress IP IPAddress.TryParse127.0.0.1, out IP Socket tTarget  null  if tTarget  null      tTarget  new SocketAddressFamily.InterNetwork, SocketType.Stream, ProtocolType.Tcp   tTarget.ConnectIP, 48000 Connected  true byte[] tBuffer  new byte[8192] string tRecvBuff    while Connected      int tRecv  tTarget.ReceivetBuffer      does stuff here   codepre  pSeems like everything works until tTarget.Connect, where it pauses for a second and then throws the exception listed above.

Negative 104803 pIts a classic login flow. The user can choose between new user or existing user. If the user is new, the name in the login box should validate against the server to see if the username is unique, if its an existing user this check will be skipped since we expect the username to be taken already ofcourse.p  pI added a [Remote] attribute on the viewmodel and added the radiobutton for newexiting user as additional fields. This way the remote validation will just return true if its an existing user, and check the database if its not, to see if the username is taken.p  pThis works great, except when the user decides to change the radiobutton newexisting after entered a username and the remote validation has run. Since remote validation is only automatically run when the username changes thats the property with [Remote] attribute, changing the radiobutton alone, will not have it run again.p  pSo my problem is, how can i force the remote validation to run again I tried the usual hacks by triggering a changefocusblur event on the username input field, but the call is not triggered. I considered adding a similar [Remote] on the radiobutton, but that would really complicate things with two equal looking error messages, placed at the same absolute position.p  pIs there any way to trigger a revalidationp

Negative 104803 pGit is essential to my workflow. I run MSYS Git on Windows XP on my quad core machine with 3GB of RAM, and normally it is responsive and zippy. p  pSuddenly an issue has cropped up whereby it takes 30 seconds to run any command from the Git Bash command prompt, including codelscode or codecdcode. Interestingly, from the bash prompt it looks likes codelscode runs fairly quickly, I can then see the output from codelscode, but it then takes 30 seconds for the prompt to return. If I switch to the windows command prompt by running codecmdcode from the start menu git related commands also take forever, even just to run. For example codegit statuscode can take close to a minute before anything happens. Sometimes the processes simply dont finish. p  pNote that I have MSYS Git installed as well as regular MSYS for things like codeMinGWcode and codemakecode. p  pI believe the problem is related to codesh.execode located in codeCProgram FilesGitbincode.

Negative 104803 pI have some configuration stored in the servlet context, sharing among servlets. The current approach is to load the config into a single copy of static hashmap shared by the servlets when the init method of any servlet is called. But the problem is the servlets just wont die, so the configuration just wont reset even if I changed the configuration in the servlet context. Because the servlet never call init again, they will not reload the configuration into the hashmap. p  pI am using websphere 7, is there any place I can configure when does a servlet die, and a new servlet is bornp  pI think it is too clumsy to reload the configuration from the servlet context when there is a new request.p  hr  pEdit I have a scheduler which will create a new thread to check for a specific data file, if the data file was new, it will create a hashmapwith content of the data file as an attribute in the servlet context.p  pNow the servlets will check for the servlet context for the hashmap and copy it to a static hashmap for shared use among servlets when they are just created and call init. But the problem is that the servlet wont die during the execution, it just make the scheduled action not working.p

Negative 104803 pIm developing a Facebook application that uses SimpleDB to store its data, but Ive realized Amazon does not provide a way to backup that data at least that I know ofp  pAnd SimpleDB is slow. You can get about 4 lists per second, each list of 100 records. Not a good way to backup tons of records.p  pI found some services in the web that offer to do the backup for you, but Im not comfortable about giving them my AWS Credentials.p  pSo I though about using threads. Problem is that if you do a select for all the keys in the domain, you need to wait for the nexttoken value of the first page in order to process the second page and so on. p  pA solution I was thinking for this was to have a new attribute based on the last 2 digits of the Facebook id. So Id start a thread with a select for 00, another for 01, and so on, potentially having the possibility of running 100 threads and doing backups much faster at least in theory. A related solution would be to split that domain into 100 domains so I can backup each one individually, but that would break some of the selects I need to do. Another solution, probably more PHP friendly, would be to use a cron job to backup lets say 10,000 records and save nexttoken, then the next job starts at nexttoken, etc. p  pDoes anyone have a better solution for this If its a PHP solution itd be great, but if it involves something else its welcome anyway.p  pPS before you mention it, as far as I know, PHP is still not thread safe. And Im aware that unless I stop the writes during the backup, there will be some consistency problems, but Im not too worried about it in this particular case.p

Negative 104803 pAfter building 5 Rails websites and having to Deal with Rails 2.3, 3.0 and 3.1 version differences, installation hassles and unexpected memory spikes with Ruby and other gotchas, Ive decided to make the move to Java Backend Web Development using Spring. Im aware that there is a world of difference between the two and JSP development isnt a next step after Rails development, but my major points are thatp  pa Java is a much more mature, faster and efficient programming language compared to Ruby. b Java Spring offers a variety of libraries, tools and plugins that can be selected and configured to custom tailor a web application. c Java itself offers a richer programming language experience compared to Ruby.p  pMy logic here may be vague, however, Im more fed up with Rails development than anything at the moment.p  pMy question finally is that is this a logical move todo Is Java development really something thats a better choice for backend developmentp

Negative 104803 pI think its easier to make sense if you could take a look at my site in question first a hrefhttpwww.10winstreak.com relnofollowhttpwww.10winstreak.comap  pThe main content area is a stream from Own3D.tv, and its just an iframe line 342.  My goal is if I click a particular stream on the right side,  the iframe would load the corresponding stream, and the left side bar Last 10 Matches would also load the corresponding data.  For example, if I click Beis Stream on the right side, the iframe would show, well, Beis stream, and the left side bar shows what it is showing right now.  But when I click on Roy Killanys Stream the iframe would then load that particular stream, and the left side bar populates with another set of defined data.p  pI guess I could achieve it by making separate pages for each stream and just duplicate the page layout so the user has the illusion of staying on the same page, but Id like to learn the proper way to do it.  My research so far tells me that ajax is probably the best option, but I was wondering if theres a pure PHP or even HTMLCSS way of doing thisp  pThank youp

Negative 104803 pRFC 3986 specifies that the a hrefhttptools.ietf.orghtmlrfc3986section3.2.2host componenta of a URI is case insensitive.  However, it doesnt specify what case insensitive means in terms of UCS or UTF8 characters.p  pExamples given in the RFC e.g. codeltHTTPwww.EXAMPLE.comcode is equivalent to codelthttpwww.example.comcode allow us to infer that case insensitive means at least that the characters AZ are considered equivalent to the character 32 ahead of them in the UTF8 character set, i.e. az.  However, no mention is made of how characters outside this range should be treated.  So, given an nonencoded, nonnormalised registered name of www.OL.com, I see three potential forms of normalisation permissible by the RFCp  ol liLower case to www.ol.com then percent encode to www.olE9.comli liLower case only AZ characters to www.ol.com and then percent encode to www.olC9.comli liPercent encode to www.OLC9.com, and then lower case the nonpercent encoded parts to www.olC9.com, producing the same result as 2.li ol  pSo the question is  Which is correct  If its case 1., what defines which characters are considered upper case, and which are considered lower case and which characters dont have a casep

Negative 104803 pIm new in writing Linux device driver, and Im wondering how the kernel codeMakefilecode magically knows what to compile. To illustrate what I dont understand, consider the following casep  pI did a codeinclude ltlinuxirq.hgtcode in my driver code and Im able to find the header file codeirq.hcode in the kernel directory codeKDIRincludelinuxcode. However, this is only the header file, so I thought the codeirq.ccode source code must be out there somewhere. Hence, I looked into the codeKDIRarcharmcode searching for codeirq.ccode since Im using the ARM architecture. My confusion begins here when I found really many codeirq.ccode inside codeKDIRarcharmcode. To simply list a few, I gotp  ul liKDIRarcharmmachat91irq.cli liKDIRarcharmmachdavinciirq.cli liKDIRarcharmmachomap1irq.cli liKDIRarcharmmachorion5xirq.cli limany more...li ul  pIn my codeMakefilecode, I have a line like thisp  precode    MAKE C KDIR MPWD CROSSCOMPILEarmnonelinuxgnueabi ARCHarm modules codepre  pSo I understand that the kernel codeMakefilecode knows that Im using the ARM architecture, but under codeKDIRarcharmcode, there are so many codeirq.ccode with the same name. Im guessing that the codemachdavinciirq.ccode is compiled since davinci is the cpu name Im using. But then, how can the kernel codeMakefilecode knows this is the one to compile Or if I would like to have a look for the codeirq.ccode that Im actually using, which one should I refer to p  pI believe there must be a way to know this besides reading the long kernel codeMakefilecode.

The second thing I should point out before anyone screams SWITCH STATEMENT at me is that not all of these conditions can be handled by a switch statement some are Object specific method calls, some are integer comparisons, etc.p  pThat said, is the following a valid way of making the above code more readable, or is there a better way of doing itp  precodepublic void someMethod      if some condition              System.err.printlnSpecific Condition 1 Error         return           if some condition 2              System.err.printlnSpecific Condition 2 Error         return           if some condition 3              System.err.printlnSpecific Condition 3 Error         return           doSomething  codepre  pSo basically, instead of checking for conditions and reporting errors in else blocks, we check for the inverse of the condition and return if it is true. The result should be the same, but is there a better way of handling thisp

Negative 104803 pI was doing FB and Twitter integration of my application using the ShareKit. Which seems to be an awesome framework which reduces the development time a lot. However there seems to be lots of bugsissues on the framework and looking on to that I discovered that theres a separate version maintained by the Open source community which is called ShareKit 2.0. p  pIt available thorough the git repo and I download the framework as a ZIP bundle. But I cant compile this bundle the culprit seems to be it lacks FBConnect and JSON Kit files. AnyIdea why they havent included these files   Will any version of FB would work with the latest Sharekit Frameworkp

Negative 104803 pWhat is the correct way to be notified once a Swing applet has finished its drawing  Im writing some timing code to measure how long the applet takes and want to include the time to display any graphics.p  pAt the end of my init method which performs all the drawing, I passed in a Runnable to SwingUtilities.invokeLater that slept for 10 seconds.  I saw the delay prior to the graphics being displayed. I would have thought that the delay would occur after the graphics since I had understood it would be queued up after the drawing calls. I tried moving this sleep test code to start and got the same results.  p  pBased on my testing with a javascript alert message, it appears that an onload event placed on a HTML body tag is also triggered prior to the graphics being drawn.p

Negative 104803 pIm developing a store locator webapplication for mobile iPhone. The idea is standard, the device uses its geolocation feature to determince the location and should then display the 510 closest stores on a map. My problem is essentially that I have too many stores 10.000 and havent yet been able to create a nice user eperience. p  pI realize this may be a bit much to ask but Id love to hear your thoughts on this..p  pbPROBLEM SCOPEbp  pi I figure I can only load some of the markers at once rather than all of them which I found that a lot of the lt100 storesfinder apps do.p  pii It should be bad connection friendly i.e. google maps should for example not be made to zoom in and out unecessearily causing new tiles to load and a empty screen to show if the connection is bad p  piii it has to somehow cope with the fact that the device gpstower triangulation can be slow to get an sufficiently accurate fix on your position often a minute or two if indoors or in an rural areap  pbSOLUTIONS Ive triedbp  pI Use getCurrentPositition and from that latlng load 5 closest markers. Issue the snapshot positioning is inaccurate and often the wrong 5 stores are loaded.p  pII Use watchPosition until accuracy reaches lt100m and then load closest 5 markers. Issue often takes way to long to get the position often 1 minute, not a good UX. p  pIII Same as II only markers are loaded contionously while it finding exact position. Issues It gets real jumpy using fitbounds or panTo every time there is an update. I.e. if the user tries to say click a marker while the map is still in find positionmode they will be intrerupted by the map changing bounds and loading more markers.p  pIV Fit bounds to an approximate position using watchPosition and a fixed zoom and use center of the map to get the closest stores. Continously load markers as watchPosition finds a better approximate center or the user himself pans the map. Issues Again, a bit jumpy since watchPosition updates alot. No your position marker.p  pbBACKGROUND INFObp  pIm using much of the standard google method of creating a store finder, shown here a hrefhttpcode.google.comintlsvSEapismapsarticlesphpsqlsearch.html relnofollowhttpcode.google.comintlsvSEapismapsarticlesphpsqlsearch.htmlap  pGoogle Maps v3 API, MySQL database, Haversine formula, JSONP asychronous loading of markerdata, no libraries jQuery or such.

Negative 104803 pThis is a continuation of my original question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8934374whyisd3d10sdklayersdllloadedduringmydx11gameWhy is D3D10SDKLayers.dll loaded during my DX11 gamea I am creating a DX11 game and am using a lowlevel windows key hook to capture AltEnter so that I can toggle fullscreen using my own methods instead of having Windows do it automatically, which inevitably causes problems.

All MyClassVar methods are inline to be as fast as possible, and AltEnter is handled from a separate thread. p
Negative 104803 pI am looking for a way to display other data in a MaskedTextBox than the data it is bound to DataTable.p  pMore specifically The DataTable contains a DateTime column DateOfBirth. Whenever the year is 1900, I would like to display it as empty in the MaskedTextBox while keeping it in the underlying DataTable, because I use 1900 for unknown.p  pExample Value in the DataTable 19001009 [DataBinding] MaskedTextBox emem1009p  pCurrently, I am using the CurrentItemChangedEvent of the BindingSource, to modify the Textproperty of the MaskedTextBox. That works nicely as long as I simply browse through the DataTable. However, as soon as I start editing the MaskedTextBox, 1900 is back.p  pIt would be nicer if I could somehow intercept the value that is passed from the DataRow to the MaskedTextBox, instead of replacing it afterwards.p  pOr maybe there is a way to get the MaskedTextBox to display 1900 as emptyp

Negative 104803 pI have created a custom C 4.0 class to be used in properties of EF 4.1 model classes. The only property of this custom class has Guid as its type. Now, I would be interested to know if I could serialize my custom class into a Guid column on model tables as if it were a primitive type supported by SQL Server 2008 R2.p  pSpecifically, I do not wish to use plain Guid as property, as the model properties have conceptually distant meaning and functionality from Guid. I wont be using the Guid as primary key. Rather, I will use it as a foreign key to access another tablecollection that has nonprimary Guid columnproperty and several rowsinstances with identical Guid. This may sound farfetched but it would be very handy design for this specific purpose.p

Negative 104803 pI am a bit of a beginner with animations and have been experimenting with CoreAnimation for a couple of days.

I have three objectsp  ul lione should be an image, moving according to a given patternli lione should be an UIImage that swaps two imagesli lione should be a text CATextLayer whose content changesli ul  pThe three actions should happen in sync.p  pAs an example, think about a programme showing a sinusoid function, like in a ECG, oscillating between 1 and 1 the first image would then move according to the current value 1, 0.9, 0.8, ... 0, 0.1, 0.2, ... 1, the swap image would show  for positive values and  for negative values, and the text would alternate between Positive and Negative.p  pIve tried with CAAnimationGroup but Im clearly missing something.

Is there any alternative way to do sop  p4 following from 3, is it possible, using CAAnimationGroup, to intercept the events to create a stopstart behaviour Lets suppose I wanted to have playstop buttons, and to resume the animation from exactly where I had left itp  pAs a conclusive question, I would simply like to know if anyone did something similar and, most importantly, if this way of doing things using a CAAnimationGroup is actually the way to go or if its better to use CAKeyFrameAnimation or something else.p

Negative 104803 pI have  scenario where I have 3 different models data being saved from one form, by means of the saveAll pass through method in CakePHP 2.xp  pThe models on the form arep  ol liProjectli liProjectImage li liProjectAttachmentli ol  p1 and 2 are saving perfectly, but I am having problems with the ProjectAttachment fields. If you look at the following image, the fields in question are at the bottom right, highlighted by a red frame a hrefhttpimg.skitch.com20120417bnarwihc9mqm1b49cjy2bp13cf.jpg relnofollowhttpimg.skitch.com20120417bnarwihc9mqm1b49cjy2bp13cf.jpgap  pstrongHere is the situationstrongp  pI have named the fields as follows ProjectAttachment.0.projectid, emProjectAttachment.0.nameem .... ProjectAttachment.6.projectid etc where the numbers are relative to the already present amount of attachments the user has added, as there is no limit. So if the user has ALREADY added 6 documents, the field would be called emProjectAttachment.7.idem and so on. This is because of the naming convention when using the saveAll method.p  pI have made use of two hidden fields, one to store the user ID, the other to store the project ID. p  pThe problem is that if the user does not fill in the Document Title and select a file to upload, the form fails If I remove all validation rules, the form no longer fails BUT a blank ProjectAttachment record is inserted.p  pI suspect the problem may also be that the projectid and userid fields that are hidden already have values in themp  pI gave it some thought, and came up with a simple concept In my controller, before the saveAll call, I would check to see if a blank Document Title field was submitted, and if so, I would completely eliminate the relevant array entry from the strongthisrequestdata[ProjectAttachment]strong array, but this did not seem to work.p  pTo clarify, I am not looking for validation rules. If the user decides they only want to upload images and not touch the ProjectAttachment form, them the saveAll operation must not fail, it must simple not attempt to save the blank fields in the form, if this is at all possible.p  pAny suggestionsp  pKind regards, Simonp

Negative 104803 pThere are lots of way to style ListViews to give them elegant look, but all of them involve modyfying the adapter or writing additional code.p  pWith the release of Android 4.0, unfortunetely things have to change. Google polished their Holo theme and gave it new look. All of the developers are now encouraged to use it, in order to make all apps look the same.p  pAnd heres the problem. Google rolled out 4.0, but there are still people using older Android versions. We cant just leave our previous custom application themes and use Holo, because it will ruin visual experience for users with older devices. And we cant force 4.0 users just to use Holo, because lets be honest  its still not perfect.p  pThe goal is to use builtin themes system and prepare some alternatives for Holo, which will look great on all devices. Then we can just switch between Holo and our themes with just setTheme and no additional problems. Unfortunetely its not that simple. We are limited to the capabilities of existing theme system and some things are just hard to do. And here comes my question.p  pTaking everything Ive mentioned into consideration, how can we control ListView look Im not able to figure out, how top  ul licreate list with rounded corners and make sure the selector background doesnt ruin it when selecting firstlast elementli licreate rounded corners not for the list but sections separated by headers, something like here img srchttpi.stack.imgur.com4AA09.jpg altenter image description hereli ul  pThe solution should affect ListViews created by PreferenceActivity without any additional lines of code.

For every screen of app we are creating an XML with some layouts static implementation. In execution, every time XML file will be read to get all the resources that it wants to display the screen which we designed.p  pThe same design can be achieved by adding few lines in the java code itself dynamic implementation.

Negative 104803 pIs it possible to assign multiple keys per value in a Python dictionary. One possible solution is to assign value to each keyp  precodedict  k1v1, k2v1, k3v1, k4v2 codepre  pbut this is not memory efficient since my data file is  2 GB. Otherwise you could make a dictionary of dictionary keysp  precodekeydic  k1k1, k2k1, k3k1, k4k4 dict  k1v1, k4v2 mainkey  keydict[k2] value  dict[mainkey] codepre  pThis is also very time and effort consuming because I have to go through whole dictionaryfile twice. Is there any other easy and inbuilt Python solutionp  pNote my dictionary values are not simple string as in the question v1, v2 rather complex objects contains different other dictionarylist etc. and not possible to pickle them brbr Note the question seems similar as a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6164973howcaniusebothakeyandanindexforthesamedictionaryvaluecomment150785386164973How can I use both a key and an index for the same dictionary valuea  But I am not looking for orderedindexed dictionary and I am looking for other efficient solutions if any other then the two mentioned in this question.p
Negative 104803 pI am inserting some data into 2 different tables. Im currently using 2 different SQL statements but Ive read from this site that its possible to do this in a transaction.p  pWhich method is better, with regards to the size of the data Currently Im just inserting 2 seperate rows at the same time into 2 different tables, unordered, so I think 2 statements is better.p  pEDIT Sorry I wasnt very clear the database Im working on is trivial, I just wanted to know the performance difference of a transaction vs. 2 seperate statements, and the performance difference as you do more statements.p
Negative 104803 pIve just upgraded my application to ARC, but I am having issues with how it handles classes with delegates. Because I am targeting iOS 4.0 and above, I am using codeunsafeunretainedcode and codeproperty unsafeunretainedcode to store the delegate pointers.p  pHowever, what I am now finding is that the services that include delegates I create in my view controllers are now hanging around after I have removed that view controller, which result in trying to communicate back with the view controller delegate after it has been deallocated... And therefore getting an error with Zombies enabled.p  pHow can I update my code in either the view controller or the service, so that when the view controller is removed popped off the nav controller stack the service with the delegate pointer also gets removed from memoryp

Negative 104803 pIm using JQuery Mobile 1.1.0 to build a simple mobile website that incorporates a listview. Ive got an issue with the nested links and back button presses. On Chrome Linux the URL goes back to codedomain.comampuipage02code but displays only the twirling loader and a blank page, and on Android the listview reappears, but clicking on a new link initiates odd behaviour the twirly loader twirls, a page loads, and then the browser returns to the listview by itself.

The code looked like the followingp  precodeltIfModule modrewrite.cgt      RewriteEngine On     RewriteBase        Canonicalize codeigniter URLs       If your default controller is something other than      welcome you should probably change this     RewriteRule welcomeindexindex.php  [L,R301]     RewriteRule .index 1 [L,R301]       Removes trailing slashes prevents SEO duplicate content issues     RewriteCond REQUESTFILENAME d     RewriteRule . 1 [L,R301]       Enforce www      If you have subdomains, you can add them to       the list using the  OR regex operator     RewriteCond HTTPHOST wwwsubdomain [NC]     RewriteRule . httpwww.domain.tld1 [L,R301]       Enforce NO www     RewriteCond HTTPHOST www [NC]     RewriteRule . httplocalhost1 [L,R301]             Removes access to the system folder by users.      Additionally this will allow you to create a System.php controller,      previously this would not have been possible.      system can be replaced if you have renamed your system folder.     RewriteCond REQUESTURI system.     RewriteRule . index.php1 [L]       Checks to see if the user is attempting to access a valid file,      such as an image or css document, if this isnt true it sends the      request to index.php     RewriteCond REQUESTFILENAME f     RewriteCond REQUESTFILENAME d     RewriteRule . index.php1 [L]  ltIfModulegt  ltIfModule modrewrite.cgt       Without modrewrite, route 404s to the front controller     ErrorDocument 404 index.php  ltIfModulegt codepre  pInitially I copypasted the code without changing it at all which was foolish on my part So the localhost in the code above was initially www.domains.tld. When I then ran localhost on my browser, it directed to www.domains.tld. I noticed the blunder and changed it to what it is above and localhost still directs to www.domains.tld I deleted the .htaccess file to reverse the effect but it still does the same thing. I also changed my root folder for localhost but whatever I do localhost points to domains.tld. When I type 127.0.0.1 on the address bar of my browser, it directs correctly to my website. I have spent hours reading up on the reason for this behavior but am unsuccessful to find a solution.p  pAny help will be greatly appreciated.p  pThanks, H.p

Negative 104803 pIm attempting to test a typical controller flow for user login.  There are extended relations, as with most login systems, and the Grails documentation is completely useless.  It doesnt have a single example that is actually realworld relevant for typical usage and is a feature complete example.p  pmy test looks like thisp  precodeTestForUserController class UserControllerTests extends GroovyTestCase      void testLogin          params.login  [email test1example.com, password 123]         controller.login         assert usermain  response.redirectUrl       codepre  pThe controller doesp  precodedef login      if params.login          return          printlnEmail   params.login.email     Person p  Person.findByEmailparams.login.email     ...  codepre  pwhich fails withp  pgroovy.lang.MissingMethodException No signature of method immigration.Person.methodMissing is applicable for argument types  values []p  pThe correct data is shown in the println, but the method fails to be called.p  pThe test suite cannot use mocks overall because there are database triggers that get called, the result of which will need to be tested.p  pThe bizarre thing is that if I call the method directly in the test, it works, but calling it in the controller doesnt.p  pFor an update  I regenerated the test directly from the grails command, and it added the Test annotationp  precode    TestForUserController     class UserControllerTests extends GroovyTestCase          Test         void testLogin              params.login  [email test1example.com, password 123]             Person.findByEmailparams.login.email             controller.login               codepre  pThis works if I run it with      grail testapp integration UserControllerp  pthough the result isnt populated correctly  the response is empty, flash.message is null even though it should have a value, redirectedUrl is null, content body is empty, and so is view.p  pIf I remove the TestFor annotation, it doesnt work even in the slightest.  It fails telling me that params doesnt exist.p  pIn another test, I have two methods.  The first method runs, finds Person.findAllByEmail, then the second method runs and cant find Person.findAllByEmail and crashes with a similar error  method missing.p  pIn another weird update  it looks like the response object is sending back a redirect, but to the application baseUrl, not to the user controller at all.p
Negative 104803 pSo I am writing a program that runs through a list of Facebook users URLs already provided and then accesses their graph API. So user facebook.comjosh.maddock.7 accesses graph.facebookcomjosh.maddock.7 . p  pUnfortunately, the program is randomly picking a time to stop working and decides that every URL it receives form that point on is invalid and returns http response code 400. For example, one time it will access the graph information correctly for 1500 users, and when it is run immediately after, it only works for 500. Even though the URLs are fine and it may have worked fine for the execution directly before or after, it still returns these errors.p  pIt sleeps for 50 seconds after every 500 users, as this first seemed to help the problem but obviously not well enough. I tried sleeping for up to 5 min and still had this problem.p  pDoes anyone know why it may be doing thisp  pThank you.p

In order to do that I need to define an options array named codeoptscode that is passed to codestreamcontextcreatecode. The returned results from codestreamcontextcreatecode are then to be stored in a variable named codecontentscode. We then store the returned results from codefilegetcontentscode into a variable named codecontentscode. Finally we convert the returned data from codefilegetcontentscode into the variable codehtmlcode.p  pTo start of course we would need to build a simple handler that sends our JSON to the server. p  pMost importantly we need to create a backend function to parse our results and send back our data.p  pThe question is, how might we go about doing this in an open ended context where any possible sequence of PHP functions calls and code might be passedp

Negative 104803 pWhy does codeSocket.BeginSendcode go asynchronous so quickly and so unpredictably I know its supposed to be asynchronous, but it can also complete immediately, in which case codeIAsyncResult.CompletedSynchronouslycode is set. I would expect codeCompletedSynchronouslycode to be true until the 8KB send buffer is filled up. The test case below cleanup code stripped for brevity demonstrates that codeBeginSendcode goes asynchronous on typically 3rd iteration after buffering only 6 bytes of datap  pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecodeTcpListener listener  new TcpListenerIPAddress.Any, 35001 listener.Start Socket client  new SocketAddressFamily.InterNetwork,     SocketType.Stream, ProtocolType.Tcp client.Connectnew IPEndPointIPAddress.Loopback, 35001 Socket server  listener.AcceptSocket for int i  1 i lt 10 i      bool sent  false     IAsyncResult result  client.BeginSendnew byte[]  1, 2, 3 , 0, 3,         SocketFlags.None, r gt sent  true, null     Assert.IsTrueresult.CompletedSynchronously,  fails typ. on 3rd iteration         String.FormatAsynchronous on iteration 0, i     Assert.IsTruesent     client.EndSendresult  codepre  pThe exact iteration when it goes asynchronous is somewhat random. When process starts, its 3. Afterwards its 1 for all new sockets. Ive seen other numbers sporadically. I know the 8KB socket send buffer is there, because codeSocket.Sendcode with codeSocket.Blocking  falsecode stops at about 8KB.p  pMethod codeSocket.SendAsynccode behaves similarly except it always completes asynchronously i.e. no attempt at direct buffer write. See my a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions14345297whendoessocketsendasynccompletesynchronouslyrelated question about Socket.SendAsynca.p  pI need codeBeginSendcode to be mostly synchronous for performance reasons asynchronous callbacks are slower. Not to mention the unpredictability ruins unit tests and benchmarks for my lowlevel communication code.p

My questions is do you need separate view controllers for handling the different orientations  If so, do you copy and paste all your code from portrait view controller to landscape view controller and then connect all the outlets and actions on the new view controller  If this is the case, then is orientation code written in the a separate class perhaps the app delegate giving instructions on which view controller to access  Every time I go looking into this I see code like this writtenp  precodeif allowLandscape  return UIInterfaceOrientationIsLandscapetoInterfaceOrientation  toInterfaceOrientation  UIInterfaceOrientationPortrait    else   return toInterfaceOrientation  UIInterfaceOrientationPortrait   codepre  pIn the above code, what would the toInterfaceOrientation method look like and where is the above code written  Is it in the view did load method of the portrait  landscape view controllers or in a different classp

Tried conversion to string[DTSTR] between S  D, removed it, changed SQL Table VARCHAR to NVARCHAR and still get this flippin error. p  pBecause I am creating the sheet in Excel with a SQL statement I do not see any way to actually predefine what the data types of the columns will be in the Excel sheet.

And to get this, I first need to count after how many names in the list column A, Johnny has been mentioned 100, 200, etc. times.

Negative 104803 pI have a relatively simple question I think. Im working on a piece of Cython code that computes the radius of a strain ellipse when the strain and a specific direction are given i.e. the radius parallel to the given direction for a certain amount of strain.

If you example search for Pant, you get SearchPants.aspx. But google require to have a query parameter in order to count the number of keywords searched.p  pSo my solution to this was having the following jQuery code inserted in my Search.aspx page. The code fire up a URL with a query parameter to GA including the keyword that was searched for. As you can see Im using lt this.keywords  that eCommerce software use to generate the breadcrumb in the search result page.p  pThe problem with this is when users navigate to page 2,3,4.. through the search results, the jQuery code still fire up to GA the same keywords for being searched when its not. So the keywords count gets inflated in my GA reports.p  pCould you please help setup something that will count the search only one time. This is the URL generated when someone go to page 2, SearchKeywords.aspx2 and so on.

Negative 104803 pIt is important to note that a heap block might be considered busy in the eyes of the back end allocator but still not being used by the application. The reason behind this is that any heap blocks that go on the front end allocators look aside list still have their status set as busy.p  pMy question reguarding this is  if the heap block status is set as busy , why would the front end allocator add it to the LAL as available for use p  pIn other words, the status flag is either indicating either the block is busy or free. So why the free blocks arent in the LAL , and how can those blocks be assigned to the LAL if their status flag is set to busy they can be busy or not as the statement say p

Negative 104803 pHow do I retrieve data via an AJAXJSON call and display an error message on the page if the validation or call failed for what ever reasonp  pI am using ASP.NET MVC 5 together with jQuery.p  pI have an add form with multiple textboxes, what this page adds is irrelevant.  One of the textboxes is for an employee number to be filled in, for example 123456.  Right next to this textbox I have a button labeled Populate Employee Details.  What this button does is if it is clicked it does a service call to retrieve all this employees details from an external data source.  It then fills in certain textboxes with the data that it returned from the service call.  This button is not the submit button to submit the form data to be saved in the database.  Its just an additional button on the form to do an external lookup.  This is what it looks likep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comwyWS8.jpg altenter image description herep  pThe partial HTML code for the above section is as followsp  precodelttrgt      lttd classeditlabelgtEmployee Number ltspan classrequiredgtltspangtlttdgt      lttdgt           Html.TextBoxForx gt x.EmployeeNumber, new  maxlength  6            Html.ValidationMessageForx gt x.EmployeeNumber           ltbutton idPopulateEmployeeDetailsButton typebuttongtPopulate Employee Detailsltbuttongt      lttdgt lttrgt codepre  pThe jQuery code for the above section is as followsp  precodedocument.readyfunction        PopulateEmployeeDetailsButton.clickfunction             var url  ApplicationGetEmployeeDetails           var data   employeeNumber EmployeeNumber.val             .getJSONurl, data, function data                 Title.valdata.Title                FirstName.valdata.FirstName                LastName.valdata.LastName                   codepre  pThe GetEmployeeDetails action method that returns a JSON result setp  precodepublic ActionResult GetEmployeeDetailsstring employeeNumber       Employee employee  employeeService.GetEmployeeDetailsemployeeNumber       return Jsonemployee, JsonRequestBehavior.AllowGet  codepre  pMy view model for this form looks something like thisp  precodepublic class ApplicationViewModel  ViewModelBase       [RequiredErrorMessage  Employee number is required]      [StringLength6, MinimumLength  6, ErrorMessage  Employee number must consist of 6 numbers]      [RegularExpressiond, ErrorMessage  Employee number must be numeric]      public string EmployeeNumber  get set        [RequiredErrorMessage  First name is required]      public string FirstName  get set        [RequiredErrorMessage  Last name is required]      public string LastName  get set         I have left out the rest  codepre  pThe above works fine if I click on the forms submit button, then all these error messages display depending what type of error it is.p  pWhat I need to implement is the following.

And if something doesnt validate properly I need the validation to fire and display the error messages like it would have when I clicked on the forms submit button.

Negative 104803 pI want to allow only negative numeric and decimal input with the nice numeric keypad that shows all the numbers in a 3x3 keypad.

Negative 104803 pI have to create a 3 tier drop down navigation menu and am using the following code to perform the database lookupp  precodepcategorysql  SELECT parentcat, subcat, product FROM tblItems WHERE statusactive ORDER BY parentcat, subcat pcategorydo  mysqliquerymysqli, pcategorysql if pcategorydo dieInvalid query  . mysqlierrormysqli codepre  pI then use codepcatdata  pcategorydogtfetchassoccode to put the data into a workable array.p  pWhat I then want to do is get the distinct values of codepcatdata[parentcat]code which will create a div for each distinct value and will become the first level menu within each distinct parentcat then create a div inside this parentcat div that has distinct values of codepcatdata[subcat]code and within each subcat div create another set of divs that are the distinct values of codepcatdata[product]code Could anyone give me some pointers on how to achieve this.p
Negative 104803 pI had read a couple JAXB tutorials and I tried to implement my own.  I am getting null back. I am unsure why I am getting null.  Here is my XML Document. I am sorry in advance for how long this post is with mostly code. I am just not sure if I am implementing JAXB correctly or not.  p    precodeltEZMAXMOBILEOFFLINEPROPERTIES synctimegt  ltENTITYDEFSgt     ltENTITY nameWORKORDERgt         ltINDEXESgt

Negative 104803 pIm getting a strange behavior from the Office VBA Editor certain terms no longer capitalize when they are recognized.  In fact, I can use the autoselect to choose the term, which is properly capitalized until the compiler validates the line and the editor actually changes it to lower case. p  pFor example, today I typed this codeSet wFramework  application.ActiveWorkbookcode using the autoselect to choose code.ActiveWorkbookcode, but as soon as I pressed [Enter], the compiler changed it to codeSet wFramework  Application.activeworkbookcode. Notice that the compiler properly capitalized codeApplicationcode but improperly removed the capitalization from code.activeworkbookcode. p  pFor now the number of objects  methods that dont capitalize correctly is small, but seems to be growing. p  pIve tried things like turning off all the code settings in hopes this would somehow reset things, but that was a nonstarter. I cant find anywhere with controls for that function. I wondered if this is handled through the References, but there doesnt seem to be anyway those should be editable, especially without my doing it on purpose. Im also wondering if this is somehow a function of Windows improperly tracking case management, but again it seems like that would be specific to a Windows session, and this symptom persists even if I have shut down the computer completely and restarted.p  pDoes anyone know what might cause this, and whether it is possible to resetp

Negative 104803 pI have a form that asks for basic information for a guest object, basically name, phone, email. I also have a button that allows the user to add more guests, which basically duplicates the original form using jQuery. When the user clicks the submit button, I want to have all of the guests that they have added in the page be submitted to the controller for creation. Im struggling with figuring out the most appropriate way to handle a submit like this is.p  p1  Should I be submitting multiple objects of the same type in seperate forms I actually have the submit working right now using one form, and just making sure each guest attribute field name is unique firstname1, firstname2, etc.. While this works, it feels very hacky. I felt separating each guest into its own form was cleaner. Having everything in one form requires me to track how many attributes each guest can submit, and if for some reason they arent submitted with the expected number of attributes, Ill have an error.p  p2  Should I use jQuery  ajax for this submit I dont know much about JSON, but would it make sense at all to use it for thisp  pIm basically looking for a best practice for this situation. I think if I know the most appropriate way to handle it, I can probably find the syntax somewhere.p  pThe application back end is rails. I can provide additional information if needed.p  pThanksp  hr  pSee below for the markupp  precodeltdiv idguestsgt     ltdiv idguest1 classguestgt         ltform namecontact classformhorizontal bsform action  classcontactgt             ltfieldsetgt                 ltinput required typetext classinputmedium required namefirstname1 idfirstname1 placeholderFirst Name autocorrectoff autocapitalizationongt                 ltinput required typetext classinputmedium required namelastname1 idlastname1 placeholderLast Name autocorrectoff autocapitalizationongt                 ltinput typetext classinputmedium namephonenumber idphonenumber1 placeholderPhone Number autocorrectoffgt                 ltinput typetext classinputmedium nameemail idemail1 placeholderEmail autocorrectoffgt                 ltselect classhost namehost1 idhost1gt                     ltoption valuefalse selectedgtNot table hostltoptiongt                     ltoption valuetruegtTable hostltoptiongt                 ltselectgt             ltfieldsetgt         ltformgt     ltdivgt ltdivgt lta href classadd btn btninfogtAdd Another Guestltagt  ltdiv classformactionsgt     ltbutton typesubmit classbtn btnprimary btnprevious idaddguestsubmitgtSubmitltbuttongt ltdivgt codepre  pHeres a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netjrmceGCBhL relnofollowa fiddlea that shows the markup and jquery doing the form creationdeletion.

Negative 104803 pIs there any way to speed up the load of rdf files into Sesame I have files ranging in size from a few of MB to a couple of GB in Ntriple format. I have tried the three first approaches in a hrefhttprivulidevelopment.comfurtherreadingsesamecookbookloadinglargefileinsesamenative relnofollowSesame Cook Booka, but to no avail.

Essentially I want to store the data in two versions, one which is regular rdf and one which is optimized for certain queries  hence the need for storing them separately. I have been looking at the a hrefhttpopenrdf.callimachus.netsesame2.7apidocsorgopenrdfsailinferencerfcCustomGraphQueryInferencer.html relnofollowCustomGraphQueryInferencera, but have not figured out if I can use this to store the data separately.

Negative 104803 pIts possible to send email to one address while another address is listed in the emails TO header. That is to say, Envelopeto and the TO header dont necessarily have to match.

Negative 104803 pI am trying to implement a simple projective texture mapping approach by using shaders in OpenGL 3. While there are some examples on the web I am having trouble creating a working example with shaders.p  pI am actually planning on using two shaders, one which does a normal scene draw, and another for projective texture mapping. I have a function for drawing a scene  codevoid ProjTextureMappingScenerenderSceneGLFWwindow windowcode and I am using glUseProgram to switch between shaders. The normal drawing works fine. However, it is unclear to me how I am supposed to render the projective texture on top of an already textured cube. Do I somehow have to use a stencil buffer or a framebuffer objectthe rest of the scene should be unaffected p  pI also dont think that my projective texture mapping shaders are correct since the second time I render a cube it shows black. Further, I tried to debug by using colors and only the codetcode component of the shader seems to be nonzeroso the cube appears green. I am overriding the codetexColorcode in the fragment shader below just for debugging purposes.p  pstrongVertexShaderstrongp  precodeversion 330  uniform mat4 TexGenMat uniform mat4 InvViewMat  uniform mat4 P uniform mat4 MV uniform mat4 N  layout location  0 in vec3 inPosition layout location  1 in vec2 inCoord layout location  2 in vec3 inNormal  out vec3 vNormal, eyeVec out vec2 texCoord out vec4 projCoords  void main      vNormal  N  vec4inNormal, 0.0.xyz      vec4 posEye     MV  vec4inPosition, 1.0     vec4 posWorld   InvViewMat  posEye     projCoords      TexGenMat  posWorld       only needed for specular component      currently not used     eyeVec  posEye.xyz      glPosition  P  MV  vec4inPosition, 1.0  codepre  pstrongFragmentShaderstrongp  precodeversion 330  uniform sampler2D projMap uniform sampler2D gSampler uniform vec4 vColor  in vec3 vNormal, lightDir, eyeVec in vec2 texCoord in vec4 projCoords  out vec4 outputColor  struct DirectionalLight      vec3 vColor     vec3 vDirection     float fAmbientIntensity   uniform DirectionalLight sunLight  void main void       supress the reverse projection     if projCoords.q gt 0.0              vec2 finalCoords  projCoords.st  projCoords.q         vec4 vTexColor  texturegSampler, finalCoords          only t has nonzero values..why         vTexColor  vec4finalCoords.s, finalCoords.t, finalCoords.r, 1.0         vTexColor  vec4projCoords.s, projCoords.t, projCoords.r, 1.0         float fDiffuseIntensity  max0.0, dotnormalizevNormal, sunLight.vDirection         outputColor  vTexColorvColorvec4sunLight.vColor  sunLight.fAmbientIntensity  fDiffuseIntensity, 1.0       codepre  pstrongCreation of TexGen Matrixstrongp  precodebiasMatrix  glmmat40.5f, 0, 0, 0.5f,                   0, 0.5f, 0, 0.5f,                   0, 0, 0.5f, 0.5f,                   0, 0, 0, 1       43 perspective with 45 fov     projectorP  glmperspective45.0f  zoomFactor, 4.0f  3.0f, 0.1f, 1000.0f     projectorOrigin  glmvec33.0f, 3.0f, 0.0f     projectorTarget  glmvec30.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f     projectorV  glmlookAtprojectorOrigin,  projector origin                                     projectorTarget,      project on object at origin                                      glmvec30.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f    Y axis is up                                          mModel  glmmat41.0f ... texGenMatrix  biasMatrix  projectorP  projectorV  mModel invViewMatrix  glminversemModelmModelView codepre  pstrongRender Cube Againstrongp  pIt is also unclear to me what the modelview of the cube should be Should it use the view matrix from the slide projectoras it is now or the normal view projector Currently the cube is rendered blackor green if debugging in the middle of the scene view, as it would appear from the slide projectorI made a toggle hotkey so that I can see what the slide projector sees.

Negative 104803 pI am using Eclipse JUNO with the subclipse plugin.p  pGenerally it works quite well. To commit files to the SVN repository you synchronize to check the changes you have made. Select the files you want to commit, add a comment and simply commit it.p  pUsually the selected files are then properly committed.p  pHowever, sometimes the selected files view in the commit window do not correspond to the actually selected files in the synchronize view. Instead it simply indicates all files in the projects file directory.p  pIf you dont notice and commit you end up committing dozens of filesdirectories you do not want or need to commit.p  pI have tried all sorts of things to try and make it do that so that I know which chain of actions triggers it so I can avoid it but of course it never does it when you try.p  pDoes anyone have any suggestions as to what might be causing it or experienced the same It is definitely not that the selected files are no longer selected. I could clearly see that selection still being active on the left hand side synchronization view but still the commit window was showing a full file selection.p  pAny helpsuggestion much appreciated.p
Negative 104803 pIm using magento C.E 1.7. I use all shipping methods of magento and Im viewing only one shipping method in the front end, which has higher priority. Im using table rate shipping for some countries.p  pI wanted to add strongspecial fixed shipping pricestrong for some products when they shipped to that countries only. So that, I added new shipping method namely strongflat rate per productstrong, by using a new module. p  pBased on this module, a text box is added to all the products in admin to specify the special shipping price. If I filled this field with some value, It considers it as a special shipping price. And if not filled it, it will be considered as special shipping price is 0. p  pSo I have given least priority in the sort order for this shipping method to avoid this method from viewing on front end when products without special shipping price and products with special shipping price both are added into the cart.p  pSo that, If only the special shipping priced product is added to the cart, It shows only table rate shipping method  in front end.p  pI checked the code in availble.phtml. There is a foreach loop to proceed with available shipping methods. I need to check the availability of the strongflat rate per productstrong and its price value for the product before start of loop execution.p  pI tried to get all the values of the array. But I could not. Can anyone help on thisp

Negative 104803 pI have an Oracle DB sequence that is being called by the following JPA.  The problem is that the sequence that is being returned is not the same sequence number that the database is actually using.  The JPA component is usually one less than the actual id  for the record that is inserted into the table.  For instance, when debugging JPA states that the objects Id will be 3689711 but after the record is persisted, the actual record in the table is 3689712, but it isnt always so recognizable.  Once the record is created, I need to obtain the correct ID so that I can pass it to another process, but without the correct number, the next process fails.p  precodeId SequenceGeneratornameSDRLEARNINGACTIVITYTRANSCRIPT, allocationSize1 GeneratedValuestrategyGenerationType.SEQUENCE,generatorSDRLEARNINGACTIVITYTRANSCRIPT Basicoptional  false NotNull Columnname  ID private Long id codepre  p1 I have the following DDL for my Oracle sequencep  precodeCREATE SEQUENCE  SDRLEARNINGACTIVITYTRANSCRIPT   MINVALUE 1 MAXVALUE 999999999999999999999999999  INCREMENT BY 1 START WITH 3690531 CACHE 20 NOORDER  NOCYCLE  codepre  pI know I could work around this and add a temporary value to another field and then do a look up on a temporary value to get the real value of the PK after the record is persisted, but this seems like a lot of extra DB calls for something this basic.  Any help would be appreciated.p  p2 It appears that JPA simply queries the nextVal from the sequence but has no way of locking that in to the DB prior to the actual commit.  Since it executes the sequence to determine the next value that forces the sequence to automatically generate a new nextVal.  Im not sure that it matters, but my sequence is triggered before the record inserts into the table.  So, when JPA finally commits the record, the underlying database triggersequence actually generates a new sequence value meaning the original sequence number JPA claimed to have is actually overwritten by the underlying database when it calls the sequence again.  So, the only solution that seems to make sense is to modify the underlying database trigger to not generate a sequence if the column already has a value, but that seems risky.  The sequence generation within JPA seems flawed at best if you need to take advantage of the sequence number for other processes.p

Negative 104803 pIve set up a new Visual Studio 2012 Database Project to hold the assets for a database and Im having problems getting the project to build properly. The issue that Im facing is that we have custom code within our database scripts that does certain evaluations when executed. This is by design, and works well. However because its more complex than the standard database script for say a table the project wont build. Id like to turn off the validation   so that the project can build and deploy without being failing the build. Is there a way to turn off the validation portion of the project Im new to working with DB project types in VS, so not sure what all may be available. Any other strategies or workarounds are also welcome. p

Negative 104803 pI dont know much about TFS except that I use it.

Negative 104803 pI am currently learning how to store files without using FILESTREAM attribute on varcharmax in SQL Server, because I dont need to store very large binary files. Despite that I want to store the binary data by small chunks of it. What I found was the SqlParameter.Offset Property. Here is some info about it from MSDNp  pThe Offset property is used for clientside chunking of binary and string data. For example, in order to insert 10MB of text into a column on a server, a user might execute 10 parameterized inserts of 1MB chunks, shifting the value of Offset on each iteration by 1MB.p  pIt sounds like it is exactly what I need, but I am confused about how to use it. I created a very simple Table called BinaryFilesTable Id, FileData.The Id is the primary key and FileData is varbinarymax. Here is my code so far.p  precodepublic static void Mainstring[] args              var fileBytes  File.ReadAllBytes....image.jpg          const string connectionString  Server. DatabaseTestDb Integrated Securitytrue         SqlConnection connection  new SqlConnectionconnectionString          connection.Open         using connection                      string commandText  INSERT INTO BinaryFilesTableFileData VALUES binaryFileData              SqlCommand command  new SqlCommandcommandText, connection              SqlParameter commandParameter  new SqlParameter             commandParameter.ParameterName  binaryFileData             commandParameter.Value  fileBytes             commandParameter.SqlDbType  SqlDbType.VarBinary             commandParameter.Size  1  VarBinary becomes VarBinarymax if size is set to 1.             commandParameter.Offset   How to use it               command.Parameters.AddcommandParameter              command.ExecuteNonQuery               codepre  pWith this code I managed to store the data in the table, but I am not exactly sure how it works. As I understand it, in the moment the binary data is stored all at once and that is the reason I want to figure out how to use this Offset property. I spent several hours searching for a tutorial but had no success.p  pEDIT  If I set some value to the offset I get the following exceptionp  pSystem.ArgumentException Offset and length were out of bounds for the array or count is greater than the number of elements from index to the end of the source collection.p

Negative 104803 pI am streaming mic input from a C Server via socket. I know the stream works because it does with a C client and I am getting the right values on my Android client.p  pI am streaming a 1024 floatarray. One float are 4 bytes. So I got a incoming stream with 4096 bytes per frame. I am getting the floats out of this bytes and I know this floats are the ones I sent, so that part should work.  p  pNow I want to get that stream directly to the phones speakers by using AudioTrack. I tried to input the bytes I received directly just noise. I tried to cast it back to a byte array, still the same. I tried to cast that float into short because AudioTrack takes bytes or short. I could get something that could have been my mic input knocking, but very scratchy and and extremely laggy. I would understand if there was a lag between the frames, but I cant even get one clear sound. I can, however, output a sin sound clearly that I produce locally and put into that shortarray. Now I wonder if I got some issues in my code anyone of you can see, because I dont see them.p  pWhat I am doing is I put 4 bytes in a byte array. I get the float out of it. As soon as I got one Frame in my float array I am controlling that with a bool, not nice, but it should work I put it in my shortarray and let audiotrack play it. This double casting might be slow, but I do it because its the closest I got to playing the actual input.p  pstrongEditstrong I checked the endianess by comparing the floats, they have the proper values between 1 and 1 and are the same ones I send. Since I dont change the endianess when casting to float, I dont get why forwarding a 4096 byte array to AudioTrack directly doesnt work neither. There might be something wrong with the multithreading, but I dont see what it could be. p  pstrongEdit 2strong  I discovered a minor problem  I reset j at 1023. But that missing float should not have been the problem. What I did other than that was to put the method that took the stream from the socket in another thread instead of calling it in a async task. That made it work, I now am able to understand the mic sounds. Still the quality is very poor  might there be a reason for that in the code Also I got a delay of about 10 seconds. Only about half a second is caused by WLAN, so I wonder if it might be the codes fault. Any further thoughts are appreciated.p  pstrongEdit 3strong I played around with the code and implemented a few of greenapps ideas in the comments. With the new thread structure I was facing the problem of not getting any sound. Like at all. I dont get how that is even possible, so I switched back. Other things I tried to make the threads more lightweight didnt have any effect. I got a delay and I got a very poor quality I can identify knocks, but I cant understand voices. I figured something might be wrong with my convertions, so I put the bytes I receive from the socket directly in AudioTrack  nothing but ugly pulsing static noise. Now I am even more confused, since this exact stream still works with the C client. I will report back if I find a solution, but still any help is welcome.p  pstrongEdit 4strong  I should add, that I can play mic inputs from another android app where I send that input directly as bytes I would exclude the float casting stuff and put the bytes I receive directly to audioTrack in my player code.br Also it occured to me, that it could be a problem, that the said floatarray that is streamed by the C Server comes from a 64bit machine while the phone is 32bit. Could that be a problem somehow, even though I am just streaming floats as 4 bytes Or, another thought of mine The underlying number format of the bytes I receive is float. What format does AudioTrack expect Even if put in just bytes  would I need to cast that float to a int and cast that back to bytes or somethingp  pstrongnew codestrong  p  precodepublic class

Negative 104803 pI have a custom relative layout that handles touch event to rotate this layout. The custom relative layout parent has an image view and frame layout as its children. The frame layout in turn has a relative layout not custom which in turn has a number of image buttons. The image buttons can be considered as children in this case. p  pI have onTouch listener for each image button.  I have overridden the onInterceptTouchEvent in custom relative layout to return true so that childs touch event is not triggered when I rotate the custom parent layout. But when I tap or touch on the image buttons doesnt trigger the touch event of image button. If I return false from onInterceptTouchEvent in parent layout, the childs onTouch listener gets triggered and causes a rotation of the button, which I dont want. p  pHow do I handle or dispatch touch events of the parent to its own onTouchEvent except the case where image button is clicked or touched, and the image button touch action takes effect without calling parents touch eventp

Negative 104803 pVersion 1.10 of jQuery DataTables changes a ton of things from the previous versions of DataTables, including how it handles the Ajax requests and responses. p  pThe developers of the library do not have any experience working with an ASP.NET backend, so although some of the nuances of WebMethods have been brought up to them in the past, they apparently didnt consider them in this version. p  pFor example, the codedataSrccode DataTables option should be where we deal with the fact that ASP.NET WebMethods wrap all of their Ajax responses with coded [response]code. p  pInstead, DataTables only looks at the codedataSrccode setting to find the data property, not the rest of the required response information codedrawcode, coderecordsTotalcode, coderecordsFilteredcode, and codeerrorcode. My memory could be incorrect, but Im pretty sure the codedataSrccode setting used to handle this just fine.p

Negative 104803 pI am scraping some data tables using Selenium Webdriver, and in order to gather all the data I need to do a few hundred consecutive page turns using a next button. p  pHere is a code excerptp  precodedef turnPageself     try          self.findelementbycssselectors[names]  self.nextEl.name,self.nextEl[name].click         return True     except Exception as e         print ERROR,stre         print no next element found on the page. assuming weve come to the last one...n         return False codepre  pprobably nonessential self.nextEl is a BeautifulSoupparsed html tag. i cant use very specific selectors like id, as this has to be fairly robust across different web sites. thats why the precise nature of the next element is determined with another function, and implemented flexibly.p  pMy question is The slowest part of this scraping algorithm is the buttonfinding step. It takes about 30 seconds to find the button on the page. Is there a faster way Specifically, is it possible to restrict the search domain for the webdrivers find methods I think the reason this is so slow is that it has to search through the huge amount of data on the page before it finds the next element, which is near the bottom.p  pIm using Selenium version 1.43 with PhantomJS 1.98 via Python 2.7 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS GNULinux 3.17.1elastic x8664. Whew.p  pEdit Selenium seems to draw complaints around the internet for being too slow, so hopefully a question that seeks to speed up some of its actions will be broadly helpful.  p

But for me, my client is another server and he has to store this key safe and to use it reliable.

Negative 104803 pSo Ive been working on this homework problem for a few hours, Ill do my best to explain it.p  pI need to write a program in python that takes a list and starts you at the first item in the list, you can either move forward one space or jump over an item and land on the other side of it, each item you land on costs the number on that location.  The goal is to get to the end as cheaply as possible.p  pI wrote this function,p  precodedef playercost, board, playerpos     if playerpos  lenboard  1             return cost     if playerpos lt lenboard  2              if board[playerpos  1] gt board[playerpos  2]             return playercost  board[playerpos  2], board, playerpos  2         else             return playercost  board[playerpos  1], board, playerpos  1     elif playerpos  lenboard  2         return cost  board[playerpos]  board[playerpos  1] codepre  pbut it cant see past the next two positions, so it might make mistakes.  A good example is this list [0,1,2,1000,0] my program outputs 3 because it picks 1 over 2, then 2 over a 1000, then 0.  This adds up to 3, but the fastest way is jump to 2, then to 0.  p  pIn the homework it says it might take a long time to run long lists, Im guessing they want me to try every possible combination of jumps and pick the cheapest one but I dont see how to do that with using recursion.p  pstrongEDITstrong  So this is the improvement I made based off of the comments, It works with all the examples my prof. gave me except for one, this is the list it doesnt return what he said it should.  [0, 98, 7, 44, 25, 3, 5, 85, 46, 4]  He says it should return 87, but my adjusted program returns 124.  Heres the new codep  precodedef playercost, board, playerpos     if playerpos  lenboard  1             return cost     if playerpos lt lenboard  2              if playercost  board[playerpos  2], board, playerpos  2 lt playercost  board[playerpos  1], board, playerpos  1             return playercost  board[playerpos  2], board, playerpos  2         else return playercost  board[playerpos  1], board, playerpos  1     elif playerpos  lenboard  2         return cost  board[playerpos]  board[playerpos  1] codepre

Negative 104803 pI cannot get speedup higher than 2 with inplace sorting algorithms quick sort and balanced quick sort QSBQS from the parallel implementation of libstdc parallel mode. I have tried to run the code on many different systems consisting of from 16 to 24 cores. I have also tried GNU and Intel C compilers, even in different versions, always with same results. The speedup around 2 is the same for any number of cores between 2 and max.p  pOn the contrary, multiway merge sort MWMS scales well speedup around 10 using 16 threads on 16 cores machine.

Negative 104803 pI am writing an application to display posts from a website and using codeHtml.fromHtmlcode to do this. However if I open an article it immediately uses about 25MB of memory to load the images.

The code below is an example of the city when that field is updated p  precode The user wants to update the city so lets go through the update process if  issetPOST[city]         Check that the city is different before we try to update it     if  newcompanycity  companycity             Check that the city is less than 50 characters and contains valid characters         if  strlennewcompanycity lt 50 ampamp pregmatch[AZaz], newcompanycity                 The city is fine so lets update it             updatesuccess  true             mysqliquerysql, UPDATE clients SET city  newcompanycity WHERE companyid  companyid or diemysqlierrorsql           else                The city doesnt meet the requirements to be update so return an error             updatefail  true             cityerror  true                   codepre  pNow the issue is that codecityerrorcode is being triggered when the current value is Sheffield and you change it to York it returns an error as the codecityerrorcode variable becomes true. However changing the value from Sheffield to Sheffield 1, it then works and updates the database.p  pAm I missing something here I thought that AZaz only checks for letters and if there are only letters then it should work. But this doesnt seem to be working at all.p  hr  pJust a quick update before I posted this. I just realised I need to add a space at the end of string and then it works. Im really confused with this. So without a space it returns an error as pregmatch doesnt allow it but with a space even though its not defined inside pregmatch it allows it. Surely this isnt normal behaviorp

Negative 104803 pSo, I have an android watch. And I noticed that when it dies my phone continuously tries to communicate with it. I have no idea why there isnt a sleep in there or something, but it prevents me from scanning any BLE devices. This seems like it is bluetooth driver issue with the phone. Now my question is, if there is any way to prevent it from acting that way, thatd be great. I would like it to try to connect for n milliseconds sleep for some seconds based off of the number of visits. From there it would then read the next item in queue and try to grab any information or connect. So a round robin. This is a way better solution then locking everyone out and starving the action queue, but who ever coded this driver obviously wasnt thinking.p  pIf I am wrong in my assumption here, Id like to know what exactly is going on.  Or if there are other solutions to this problem, thatd be great. It doesnt need to be solved that way explicitly.p  pPhone is a Samsung galaxy 6 edgep

Negative 104803 pIve come across a very weird problem. I had a JPanel which contains JTextFields and JComboBoxes. I can change the JComboBoxs when the JPanel loads but as soon as I touch or edit one of the JTextFields it doesnt let me change any of the comboboxs...p  pHere is an MCVE that works. You can use it straight away and youll see the error.p  precodeimport java.awt.BorderLayout import java.awt.EventQueue import java.awt.Panel import java.awt.event.ActionEvent import

Negative 104803 pI am trying to escape from the main loop if external stop key is pressed. Currently, communicating AT32UC with ATmega128 through RS485 communication where START and STOP keys are implemented. RS485 receiver interrupt is called if there is data to be processed in the receiver side where 0x10  Start and 0x11  Stop. p  pMy problem is that start and stop keys are recognised well and main loop is continued if start and I would like to terminate the main loop if stop key is pressed.

It could be done but it doesnt help in background and seems very bad for energy efficiency.p  pServer send information about all devices that could be found.

Negative 104803 pI am trying to find an easy way to change the color of an existing SolidColorBrush by adding a transparent overlay color. Is this possible withoutp  ul liusing shader effects, orli liputting a duplicate control on top with the overlay colorli ul  pI have been told that this MUST be possible on windows. Web developers are using this technique all the time, and this is how they communicate with the designers. They have a couple of key colours for a design, and they dont explicitly define each shade of a key color  instead they say add 10 black. I know that this can be done easily in CSS, there you dont have to worry about the exact RGB values, all you have to define is just a blending with a 10 transparent black color. I am looking for something similar for WPF, where I could easily modify my existing colors without too much extra hassle e.g. making a brush 10 darker, as if there was a 10 black object on top of it.p  pI am not looking for a mathematical calculation for overlays, I know this can be done. I am looking for a trivial way to achieve this in WPF  similarly to CSS, where you can simply define overlay colors for blending. I would like to know if this is possible or not  in WPF.p

Negative 104803 pI have 3 chef servers version 12 in my infrastructure configured to use replication with chefsync. One is configured as master and the other two are configured as a slaves.p  pSo far everything works good. But my problem appears when searching for node attributes inside recipes. Each server is only registered in one chef server, so if I want, for example, to get all the IPs of all the nodes using search inside a recipe, I only get a list of the IPs of the nodes registered in the chef server where the current machine is configured.p  pI think this behaviour is expected, but I was wondering if someone have had the same problem and found a workaround. I will appreciate any hint. Thanks.p

Negative 104803 pIm working on my first Ionic application, and Ive run across a problem getting scrolling to work within a single DIV. Ive got a YouTube search functioning code omitted from below because it isnt relevant  does not touch the div after injection or modify CSS, and it populates the youtubeDivSearch element with spans full of tables. However, no matter what Ive tried, I cant get proper scrolling to work. I have tried setting the height of ionscroll by getting the height of youtubeDivSearch after it is populated, but even though it sets the CSS property correctly, it seems to scroll an arbitrary amount down before firing the bounce effect that stops me from scrolling further, and without setting the height it simply bounces in place without any actual scrolling occurring. p  pI understand that scrolling  ionic have several questions, but I could not pinpoint a specific solution based on the questions I scoured and methods Ive found on SO.p  pI am still familiarizing myself with the framework and AngularJS itself, so if there is a better method of achieving the scroll, I would love to know  but would also like to know why my current method isnt working I thought it was a timing issue  but the height calculation is NOT done in async  it is done after  and feels hacky to begin with so Id like to change the method entirely.p  pMy markup is below.

Negative 104803 pOk, so Im new to web design. Ive been learning HTML5 and CSS3, and am working on a fairly simple website for myself, however, I just opened up Notepad and starting coding then uploaded to my web host.p  pWhat Im wondering about is, as web designers, when youve spoken to a client and have decided to build a website for that person, what are your first steps I dont mean on the business side, Im talking on the design process. Do you sketch out a layout on paper Do you use Photoshop to create a layout Illustrator Dreamweaver Do you use some sort of templates Wordpress Joomla Do you make a theme in WP and go from there Im curious about starting the design process, up to the point of starting to code in HTML and CSS. Im sure most people use a combination of these things and more, I just dont know what resources are best, before I start learning how to use them. Of course best is subjective...p  pIf anyone knows of some links to point me to good tutorials of the actual process like, Youve landed your client, what are your next steps not HTML or CSS coding tutorials, Ill gladly take them. Or if youre bored and feel like typing up a long explanation, go for itp  pBTW, just for reference, at this point I could build a simple website for someone, but theyd have to open up Notepad and edit in that then upload to the web host just to update. Obviously thats not clientfriendly, so I was thinking about getting into Wordpress for clientuse.p

Negative 104803 pI got a problem I cant get the hang of.p  pWe created a backend extension for Joomla running with a MySQL database. In the backend form there is a date field. On all our development enviroments that date field works correctly.p  pOn our customers enviroment the date field always loses a day. We checked php versions, MySQL version and time zones. Even the Joomla installations are veritable clones.p  pAll seems in order. A debug revealed php and sql timezone offsets to be 2 in all instances and enviroments.p  pIn order to debug we created two dummy entries, one by taking the php time and sending it as string to the database for parsing. The second dummy made use of the sql intern NOW, respectively CURDATE function. Both dummies showed correct values.p  pBut when I send a string representing a time through the Joomla Admin field, form and table structure it always looses a day. But only on our customers site, not in our development sites.p  pI need ideas where else to look to debug this. Thank you.p
